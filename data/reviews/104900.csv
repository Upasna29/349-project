"\n\nIf you hate this game fine, just downrate this review and move on, I like this game and I'm not ashamed of it. ORION: Prelude may not be the best game of all time, but it's certainly not the worst either. I've never seen such an amazing transformation in a video-game. This game was rather bad when it was first released. The developers rock, they show that they've put a lot of love in their work. Come on, one of the devs SOLD his friggin' CAR just for this game's sake.\n\nA lot of people say this game is crap, but everyone has different opinions, and everyone is entitled to their opinion. This game has more postive features than cons. I'd say that the only real problems with this game are that it's not well-optimized, it's somewhat repetitive, the animations kinda suck, the graphics aren't impressive, not all the game-modes are good as horde, the dinosaur AI is extremely basic, some of the sounds are basic, and the dinosaurs aren't like their real-life counterparts. I also don't like the new name and logo, they should have just kept "Orion: Dino Horde." Looking past that, this is the best dollar I've ever spent. Dinosaurs, Jet-packs, guns, robots, vehicles, explosions? Quite fun. And the soundtrack is freakin' amazing! Overall, I give this a 7/10.\n\nIf you like this, then you will like Guardians of Orion, which looks even better - I may add.","December 1, 2015","true","14.7"," 320 of 341 people (94%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","94","320","341","35","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/remnantdrive/recommended/104900/","remnantdrive","RemnantDrive","http://steamcommunity.com/id/remnantdrive/","290 products in account","ORION: Prelude\nThis game is like junk food. You know it's not the best quality, you know that you have over a hundred better ways of spending your time, and that's excluding your vast library of games, but you...\n\njust...\n\nkeep...\n\nplaying.\n\nWhat is this game about? It's exactly what it looks like. You are going to shoot that raptor in the face. You are going to get in a big stompy mech and force-feed a T-Rex a rocket sandwich slathered with molten lead. You are going to pistol whip a pterodactyl that's been annoying you for half the wave.\n\nAll of this, for less than it costs you to buy a soda.\n\n----\n\nNow, onto the useful bits of this review:\n\nThis game is geared towards five and ten-player matches. While the game offers a wealth of game mode options, you are primarily going to be concerned with PvE content, or Conquest and Survival, both of which are co-op.\n\nStraight out of the door, you are equipped with a pistol, and absolutely nothing else. There is a minute of downtime each round in Survival/Conquest, in which you can buy weapons and augmentations for your character. Pistols will never run out of ammunition. Secondary weapons consist of SMGs and shotguns. Primary weapons are automatic rifles, sniper rifles, and burstfire rifles, all usually with some form of scope for ranged shooting.\n\nAugmentations are permanent upgrades for your character that you buy with credits from killing dinos. Three augmentations are specific to your class, while the rest beef you up as the going gets rough.\n\nThere are three classes in this game: Assault, Support, and Recon. Assault players have access to a jetpack with a generous amount of energy to use to get in hard-to-reach spots. Support players are equipped with a Medigun, with the ability to heal (and, with an augmentation, repair) other players and vehicles, as well as the ability to self-heal with right-click. Recon players have access to cloaking devices, allowing you to shed off your attackers as you run like hell slink away into the darkness.\n\nAdrenaline weapons are power weapons, supposedly unique to each class. It is worth saving up the credits to get one, trust me.\n\nProgression. This game has progression for yourself, as well as your three classes. The more you play, the more permanent upgrades you get for them. Things like 10% higher jumps, available weapons on spawn in PvE modes, and so on.\n\nNow, here's the thing. This game is, for better and for worse, a tad wonky at times. The menus aren't snappy, the third-person animations are offensive (and, in the case of certain taunt packs, deliberately so), and the game isn't exactly Crysis 3. The game also has cosmetic microtransactions (gun skin, armor color/skin, silly hat, cape, and taunt pack), but the vast majority of the items available are as cheap as $1. You know, like an actual microtransaction. This would normally be a huge turn-off for me, but the game's price allows it some wiggle room.\n\nTL;DR: for the money spent, this game serves as a good distraction, especially if you're not fussed about a sci-fi shooter in which you reenact the meteor that extinct-ified everything.","April 28, 2015","true","26.2"," 311 of 331 people (94%) found this review helpful 160 people found this review funny","94","311","331","160","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/104900/","aussiedroid","Aussiedroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/","744 products in account","UPDATE : ORION PRELUDE\n\nThere simply aren't enough games with dinosaurs & even fewer of these that are actually worth playing! For me, Orion: Prelude (O:P) is that rare exception. Although not much in way of a story in the game (no single player after all), there is quite a tale on how Orion came to be the game it is today...\n\nThe short version is, that O:P is an evolution of previous Orion titles, Dino Horde & Dino Beatdown originally dating back to a successful 2011 Kickstarter campaign. Although recieving early criticism (that would normally kill a game ..dead.. disappearing into obscurity), the game continued to evolve with constant updates (big & small) over the years from the developers. Spiral stuck with it! This dedication & gradual refinement of the game has resulted in an excellent first-person co-op experience, with a well rounded collection of modes, weapons, enviromental effects, vehicles & more to enjoy.\n\nPvP isn't forgotten; it's also selectable. PvP feels more alike to a retro deathmatches, than a modern PvP (in a good way!), but I mainly enjoy the co-op modes. In co-op, you essentially have to defend your power core against waves of bloodthursty dinosaurs. Dinosaur kills will reward you credits, which you can use to buy perks & weapon upgrades, in-turn helping you survive the later, harder waves. Some waves also have you securing objectives. Co-op doesn't feel ultra competitive, most of the time you don't watch your credits/kills, rather finding yourself just having fun surviving & helping your teammates! I've found the community to generally be helpful & friendly in-game too.\n\nOne of the real stand-out features in O:P has to be the enviromental effects randomly cycling on the alien world. From the day/night cycles to the extreme variety of climates & types of weather. Adds so much to the atmosphere. Couple this with excellent lighting effects through what seems to be a thicker atmosphere and the results can sometimes be spectacular! Even overwhelming! You definitely get that feeling when your final wave gets a night cycle with heavy rain .. you know you are gonna see an epic close quarter battle!\n\nAlong with the awesome effects, there are 3 distinct classes to mix-up the gameplay. Each has unique strengths & each you can progress/level-up in online play to unlock starting weapons, power-ups & perks. Initial learning curve isn't steep, so once you get the hang of the basic flow it becomes very easy to sink multiple hours killing dinos! O:P rarely feels like a grind; even at lower levels (without a lot of perks) you competently kill dinos & gain good XP. Plenty of dinos to go around too :)\n\nIf you can't find a friend to play with, there is also bot-support added in O:P to fill the ranks. This can be helpful to get playing quickly if server populations are low (which regrettably does happen).\n\nThe trilogy of classes are well balanced (no need for any other classes), as is the gameplay in general. Difficulty is super scalable. Weapons are mainly shared between classes so quickly become familiar, and vehicles are easy to use & offer a good range of practical & destructive uses. Repetitive? Sure, to a degree, it is the same thing over & over and despite there being a lot of 'accessories' to the spice up the character classes & tactics, modes etc, there are not a huge number of maps for each mode. I expect this will change soon with Steam Workshop support being added.\n\nThe A.I. generally employed by the dinosaurs is a fairly basic 'rush' tactic, which can feel pretty predictable (there are a few surprises though), but I find the larger dino numbers to counteract this limitation to a degree anyway. There are also the occasional technical glitches like querky physics (flying Stegosaurus anyone?) or clipping inside a dinosaur. Nothing game-breaking that I have experienced, but sure does make for some funny moments! Just like my many failed attempts at some of the more creative 'Ride a Dino for 10secs' & 'Slap T-Rex 100 times' achievements :)\n\nO:P reminds me a bit of those classic, simple shooters like a Serious Sam or Left 4 Dead, but with a bit of high-tech sci-fi flavor. This future-tech feel across the game contradicts the jurassic era dinosaurs & remote wilderness landscapes nicely! O:P is not as complex mechanically or technically when compared to a top end AAA FPS, but its simplicity is also its underlying strength. It is great value ($1!), has strong replayability and the focused, balanced gameplay (some bonus ..ahem.. querks) offers a truely fun & intense, dino killin' co-operative survival experience!\n\n\nToo much to read?\n\nYeah ok then (fair call lol)..\n\nI'll let Dave Chappelle quickly summarise what O:P is really all about:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=269015668 (original artwork uploaded by Grayscars!)\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","August 26, 2014","true","81.6"," 478 of 562 people (85%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","85","478","562","41","3"

That was for Dino Beatdown, not for Horde.\nThe game has been changed a lot since the days of Beatdown. From the original 3, it has been updated to 10 different dinosaurs. 4 of which are playable in a game mode. Balancing patches, as well as optimization patches have been implemented and the game now runs like butter on my computer. There's a combonation of 50+ weapons and gear, customization of armor color and hats and other cosmetics. The Developers have been working their asses off making this game as fun as possible and it paid off.\n\nSo, what is this game like? Halo + Turok + Killing Floor. You've got your standard pistols, machineguns and shotguns and then you get your rocket launchers, laser guns and heavy weapons. Each class has their own special abilities like Jetpacks, cloaking and healing beams, all which can be augmented to be more effective. You can also level your classes for better performance like in Killing Floor which lifts the burden of having to buy certain augments and use that money for other things. You've got player vs dinosaurs, player vs player dinosaurs, player vs player, player vs harder dinosaur waves and Conquest which is coming up soon.\n\nMy only gripes right now with it are the animations being a little rough, dinosaurs can be a little derpy and the music is the same in EVERY map. I know that old music from Beatdown will be implemented once Conquest rolls out, but not sure if that's just for the Conquest maps or for all the maps.\n\nBut other than that, it's a pretty great game that has my full love.","November 25, 2013","true","280.2"," 1,033 of 1,282 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","033","1","2","50"

This game has been quite criticized through the years (and in all honestly quite rightly so). they game if filled with bugs and lots of tedious grinding achievements. Still, despite all that I can't help but to love it. In fact it is the only game which I haven't uninstalled after reaching 100%.\n\nSo, there's no story to follow in this game and it's a pretty straightforward king of game. You're dropped as one of three classes (assault, recon and support) into a base where you're supposed to defend a generator against incoming waves of attacking dinos that don't enjoy your presence there. If all teammates dies or the generator is destroyed (a timer starts when it reaches 0% health and if it isn't repaired before time runs out it's destroyed) you all loose. If you survive all waves (10 for normal games and 30 for conquest games) then you win. Pretty simple. To your help you can buy a quite big assortment of weapons and perks and each class comes with a specific perk of their own (assault can jetpack, recon can cloak and support can heal).\n\nThis game has a lot of various pvps but there are only a couple which I really enjoy such as king of the hill and team elimination. The place where this game really shines is in regular Survival mode when you play together with a good, tight and cooperative team. This is where this game is at it's best! I don't think I've made as many friends in any game as I've made in this one.\n\nSo, in conclusion, if you want a good cooperative game and don't mind a few bugs here and there and can either ignore, or work through all the grinding achievements then yes, you will enjoy this game!","November 17, 2014","true","376.3"," 205 of 241 people (85%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","85","205","241","21","8"

Some bugs and lacks polish, but for its price (50 Euro Cents thereabout?) this is a shockingly FUN game.  If you're looking for a co-op game to play with up to four other friends, I'm giving this game a glowing recommendation!\n\nIn a bit more detail:\nWhat's good: Dirt cheap\nLarge maps with obvious inspiration from the Halo games\nSurprising amount of depth thanks to the three classes, gear choices, augments and vehicles\nCompetent and frantic horde mode gameplay\nDinosaurs\nSilly waves\nWhat's bad: Some obvious bugs here and there\nSome nice shaders and lighting effects but ultimately not a great looking game, player models in particular are butt ugly\nPoor volume normalization, you'll know what I mean when you hear the gatling guns fire\nSolo play with  pretty basic bots is supported but feels very lacklustre\nVerdict:\nI'm quite frankly blown away at how many hours of very entertaining horde mode shooter action my friends and I have had with this game already, value for money wise I don't think I've ever seen any game quite like this.  As such I can't recommend this game enough.  If you compare 'ORION: Prelude' to 'Killing Floor 2' it doesn't hold a candle of course, but that would be silly, wouldn't it ?

AND NO, I'M NOT GOING TO UPDATE IT BECAUSE I'M A LAZY ♥♥♥\n\nFirst off: Metacritic score is wrong as it's for the previous game "Dino Beatdown".\n\nNow, let's go with the review:\nThe game is awesome, I've never seen a dev team update a game this much. Since release they added lots of weapons, maps, game modes, dinosaurs...\nSure, it's rough around the edges and some things could use some improvement, but the overall experience is good. Really good.\nJust imagine a team of space marines flying around and shooting at dinosaurs in various settings, jungle, forest, desert, you can even shoot dinos in the snow now!\n\nThe game modes add a lot of variety to the game, there's Survival (where you have to defend a base against the horde), Rampage (classic survival, just stay alive) or Conquest. Conquest is the newest game mode and it's like Survival x10, multiple bases, open world, day-night cycles...\n\nThen there's the PvP for all you guys tired of shoot at dinos, you can shoot your former teammates or even challenge them into a duel (1v1 pvp mode) where you use laser swords to kill each other like the Jedi.\nOh, and there's this game mode where you can play as the dinos. From the Spinosaurus to the Compy.\n\nThere's level progression too, leveling up unlocks starting weapons and habilities like, for example, in Killing Floor.\n\nI give it a 8/10, really fun and addictive.","December 21, 2013","true","60.3"," 698 of 977 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","698","977","0","19"

Confusing, isn't it?\n\nOrion: Dino Beatdown; the original, was a terrible game that launched as an alpha, with terrible netcode, and justly received a Metacritic rating of 36. Ironically, if you check the Metacritic rating, it'll be for Orion: Dino Horde. Apparently Metacritic hasn't received word from the developer that they've changed the name yet again.\n\nBut enough about how Spiral Game Studios keeps trying to reinvent the game by renaming it and patching problems that should have been fixed at release; what is the game like? Orion: Prelude is a team-based, cooperative, sci-fi, wave-based, FPS where your goal is to kill dinosaurs and complete objectives. The game is essentially what you'd get if you took Killing Floor and Halo and mixed them together. It's borrows Killing Floor's wave-based combat, where every kill gives you money to better arm yourself, and every wave gets progressively harder; and it borrows from Halo in the Shield mechanic, the vehicular combat, (although this could be atributable to other games as well) and the overall look of the game.\n\nUp to five players can play together on a single server. Within the game, there are three classes which further distinguish your role from the role of the other four players. The classes are Assault, Support, and Recon. While I'd normally explain in depth the differences between these classes, I can't because there really isn't much of a reason. If you're playing this game, you're playing it in either Survival or Conquest. Sure, there are other gamemodes to choose from, but they're all variations of standard PvP gamemodes that exist in better incarnations in other games, so you'd be better served playing them there. If you bought this game, you bought it for the dinosaurs, which means it's Survival or Conquest for you. In that case, pick Assault if you want to kill things, and pick Support if you want to keep teammates alive. There's no reason to pick Rogue in these gamemodes. It seems as though the developers made it for PvP only, as in Survival and Conquest, it suffers greatly.\n\nThe differences between the classes really come down to the single class skill you get at spawn. The Assault class gets a jetpack ability which can be improved by purchasing augments. (more on this later) The Support class gets access to a medigun which can heal a player, and with the proper augment, replenish their ammo supply. The Rogue class can turn invisible which can act as an effective temporary invulnerability, as all Dinosaurs will immediately de-aggro from you and never attack you while stealthed. Those are the differences. There's also some weapon differences, but all weapons can be bought by purchasing an augment that allows you to purchase class restricted weapons.\n\nWhat are these augments I keep referring to? Just like in Killing Floor, at the end of a wave which is usually around 20-30 dinosaurs, you have a minute to buy weapons or augments at their respective shops. Weapons are divided into four categories: primary weapons, secondary weapons, pistols, and Adrenaline weapons. Primary weapons are your standard rifles, LMG's, and Sniper Rifles. Secondary Weapons are SMG's and shotguns. Pistols are pistols, and Adrenaline weapons are class-specific weapons.\n\nAugments provide boosts to your character's fighting ability; from double jumping to boost jumping, to additional armor. There's even an augment which allows you to feast upon dinosaur corpses for health which sounds neat, but is utterly worthless. While Augments are important, there's really a select few which are far and away better than the rest which you'll find yourself buying in the same order every game, irrespective of what class you are. There are a few class-specfic augments which I alluded to earlier, but most of the desired ones are shared amongst the classes.\n\nOnto the dinosaurs. There are tiny dinosaurs like Compies, medium sized dinosaurs like Raptors and some larger spitting dinosaur, then there are large Dinosaurs like Triceratops, Stegosaurus, and of course, the T-Rex. Instead of being smart and making the large dinosaurs the primary objective of the game, the entire game focuses around killing the small dinosaurs, because the waves are determined by a specific number of dinosaurs that spawn, not the type of dinosaur. A dinosaur killed is a dinosaur killed no matter what type it is. So your best bet is to just kill all of the easy-to-kill dinosaurs, and leave the large ones alive to clean up after the wave has ended, assuming you don't have anything pressing to buy. This is the main gripe I have with the game. The main pull of the game, fighting giant dinosaurs, has been relegated to a mere distraction and nothing more. If you stop and spend time killing the large dinosaurs, you're opening yourself up to a whole lot more damage by the smaller raptors.\n\nWhen I refer to the large dinosaurs as distractions, I really mean annoyances. They'll hone in on one particular player, then constantly harass that player until one of the two dies. The T-Rex is especially annoying because it has this weird snare effect when it's damaging you which prevents you from getting away from it, so you just get caught and repeatedly bitten until you go down.\n\nWhen you lose all of your health, the game borrows the downed system from Left 4 Dead, where you can be helped up. I say they borrowed it because it seems to be a combination of the system from Left 4 Dead and Payday. Your character can fall three times. If it falls a fourth time, you're dead and can only respawn next wave. Killing a dinosaur while downed gives you a second wind, or you can be helped up by another player.\n\nThe graphics are shockingly mediocre. It seriously looks like Halo 2 on Xbox circa 2004. The Source Engine has never looked as dated as this in a long time. The character models are all low poly count, and the environments are all bland and uninspired. They are large, so there's plenty of blandness to go around.\n\nOverall, Orion: Prelude is exactly what you'd expect it to be; a bland cooperative shooter which has no identity of its own. The developers apparently tried to ride off of the novelty of players fighting dinosaurs in a sci-fi setting, but the game requires more than that. On top of that, there's something rather deceptive about trying to hide your failure by re-releasing the game under a different name, as if to try and avoid that ugly metacritic rating.\n\nThe game is nothing more than Orion: Dino Beatdown, just patched to be a working copy of it, rather than a buggy, laggy mess that shouldn't have been released. All these complaints aside, the game will provide you with a few hours of entertainment before the repitition and realization that all of these gameplay choices have been pulled from more successfull games. Considering that at the time of this review, the game is being sold on Steam for $1, with a 4-pack of it costing a grand total of $3, I struggle to think of another Steam title which you can get several hours of entertainment for four people, for just $3. Perhaps in that regard, Orion: Dino Beatdown/Dino Horde/Prelude succeeds.","December 10, 2014","true","16.0"," 115 of 140 people (82%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","82","115","140","12","15"

So I have written a review now. ^^\n\nFirst I have to say that the game has just 36/100 Metascore. But the Metascore was for the game "Dino Beatdown", not for "Orion: Dino Horde" and the game hasn’t only changed the name, its totally different now.\n\nFor many people it’s still not a good game, because of a not perfect graphic (uff.. for me the graphic looks alright – I would give for it 7/10 points. – You can take a look at my Screenshots), some bugs (really the most Shooter Multiplayer Games have bugs/glitches…) and the not so realistic weapon sounds or I DON’T KNOW WHY!\n\nReally… I LOVE THIS GAME!\n\nFor me it’s like a mix out of “Primal Carnage” (Jurassic Park Style) and “Killing Floor” plus you have more possibilities in this game. The aim of the game depends on the mission you choose (but in general it’s about shooting dinosaur (1st Person shooting view / 3rd Person Hybrid Gameplay), surviving and protecting the base).\n\nPossible Game Modes:\nSlaughter (lots of enemies)\nSurvival (protecting base, activating objects and surviving the growing waves of dinosaur)\nRampage (like in “Primal Carnage” there are 2 teams “Dinosaurs” and “Humans” who play against each other and switch after that)\n1v1 Duel • Team Duel • Team Elimination • Free for all Duel • King of the Hill • Instagib • Conquest • Gun Game\n\nYou can play it solo, friendsonly (Co-op) or public (Multiplayer).\nYou can choose the difficulty (Noob, Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane, Redikulous) you want to play and one out of 40+ possible maps!\n\nDuring the game you earn Credits to buy other weapons (50+ weapons, Tech & Gear) and (depending on the game mode) you can also use 7 different vehicles.\nBut you also earn EXP with killing dinosaur which increases your level. Yeah your level – there is also a level system in this game and the different human classes have all unique abilities.\n\nClasses:\nAssault He has a Jetpack which makes him able to fly for a while (That’s freaking awesome! It’s so funny when the T-Rex is really nearly to eat you and you just fly away BYE BYE T-REX lol). But back to the topic the Assault starts with a CV-10 Pistol (better weapons you get with killing and purchasing). His Grenade is “Frag Grenade”.\n\nRecon The Recon has the ability to use his cloak which makes him invisible for the enemies for some seconds. He starts with the CV-10 Silenced Pistol and uses the EMP Grenades.\n\nSupport The Supporter people have medic guns. They can heal themselves or other teammates whenever they want but they really need it because they can’t just fly away. They start with the M-40 Magnum and have Smoke Grenades. I like those Smoke Grenades because when you get into trouble with the Supporter because you have to reload your weapon but you can’t - because too many dinosaur are attacking you - and you are just healing yourself the whole time, it’s possible to throw such a Smoke Grenade and the dinosaur run away. Good time for reloading and healing. ^^\n\nBack to the level system:\nYou unlock more abilities with a higher level (for example less fall damage or more jump height). The current maximum reachable level is 50.\n\nAchievements:\nOh it’s just HEAVEN for achievement hunters! There are 250+ achievements and the most of them are not that hard to get. There is really for everything an achievement.. for kills with all weapons, healing, flying, riding, surviving and and and.\n\nSo all in all.. what should I say… this game offers much and makes a lot of fun! Sure it’s not perfect (e. g. weapon sound isn’t realistic) but who cares.. which game is really that realistic? In Left for Dead 2 you can shoot through a wall but not through a TENT! LOL So I tell you to give this game a try and maybe you join my games and we smash those dinosaur together! ^.~","May 21, 2014","true","194.8"," 362 of 504 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","362","504","0","41"

We all seem to have ended up with it somehow and now that we have it, we're stuck with it forever. Some of us were ashamed to have acquired it, so we thought we'd feel less lonely in our shame by giving it to someone else. Although the game is about as glamorous as herpes, it has turned out to be far more enjoyable. I won't defend the technical quality of the game (it is herpes after all), but I will defend its entertainment value. A survival co-op based on killing dinosaurs with cool guns and vehicles is just good fun. The gameplay is perfectly fine and lends itself well to many hours of pleasurable dino-slaying with a group of fellow herpes victims. The game even offers various ways of enjoying your herpes: several game modes that change things up and offer a good time even when you aren't in the mood for survival co-op. So the next time you see this on sale for a dollar, and think to yourself, "I don't wanna join the destitute of Steam and engage in this nasty transmission of cheap fun," remind yourself that you probably have some variant of herpes in real life, and you shouldn't be such a judgmental, pretentious, snob who can't put aside petty scruples in the name of good fun. Buy the game when its on sale (don't you dare pay full price for herpes), and come join us.","July 1, 2014","true","126.0"," 86 of 110 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","86","110","0","2"

YES A MECH YOU CAN FIGHT A TREX WITH A MECH! All of the vechicles are great to drive and are really helpful overall.\n\nGame breaking glitches like map glitches or crashes are very rare in this game, the only one I can think of is where you can leave a map by playing as a flying reptile or playing Assault with the jetpack and fly above the boundires, luckly this is only on one map and it's unplayed often.\n\nHowever this game does have a few downsides....\n\n1. A lot of weapon clipping, sound glitches and firing glitches, most noticeable with the default pistol, duo pistols and using reload speed upgrade.\n2. Ragdolls are really glitchy at times, however more tame then any from the Source engine.\n3. Playing as Dinosaurs is nearly impossible with the terrible camara angle and controls.\n4. Soundtrack is really stock.\n5. Small, but very friendly commuinty\n\nOverall the game is much more better then it orignally was, a fun CO-OP horde game to play with your friends!","October 19, 2014","true","6.2"," 89 of 122 people (73%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","73","89","122","7","0"

It was not able to release due to a series of events and we had to focus on a smaller scaled experience. This was called Dino Beatdown (Open World Co-Op). It was a disaster and so we continued to work on improving it using the revenue made and the next massive chunk was ORION: Dino Horde (Arena PvP, Duel).\n\nWith the success of Dino Horde we were finally were able to deliver the experience originally promised (Prelude) back in 2010. And then some - considering the original Prelude was to be strictly PvP and only have three game modes (CTF, Vital, Deathmatch) compared to it's modern day predecessor (15 game modes and a variety of play styles).

Very few are game breaking)\n- Only three classes (not a huge deal cause the existing classes are great and fit in the game well)\n-Not much of a story (BUT who really needs stroy when you got DINOSAURS!!!)\n-Micro transactions (In game store for cosmetics only)\n\n=Summary=\nOverall this game is a blast with friends and leaves you satisfied after  blowing out a dino's brains!

Summer-Rain asks, checking\non her scoped rifle. "It's cool I guess."\nyou begin, before Velociraptors saunter\ninto view from the horizon and a T-Rex\nlumbers towards all of you, spawning\n(you guessed it) Compsognathus again.\n\n"We got trouble! AIYAIYAIYAIYAIAYAI!"\nRavemeister shrieks, wearing an\nastronaut's helmet on top of his space\nranger suit which looks like a sleeker\nversion of Master Chief's SPARTAN\narmor, while firing away with his rifle.\nYou shake your head with a smile as\nSummer-Rain and The Fatman cover\nyou. The T-Rex goes down when The\nFatman and Summer-Rain commandeer\na vehicle and use the mounted cannon,\nproving once more that anything that\nis mounted and spits lead at a rate of\n600 rounds per minute is more than\nenough to send any dinosaur to\nReptile Heaven.\n\n"That was good...!" The Fatman sings,\nhis armored, anti-bomb-like form\nshuddering as he exits the Warthog-\nlookalike. "Yeah! This game isn't so\nboring now with you guys, and in a\nfar better shape than it was in as\ncompared to when it was first\nreleased!" Summer-Rain sighs, exiting\nthe mounted weapon from the\nWarthog-lookalike's rear. Ravemeister\nfist-bumps you while buying ammo\nand a health upgrade when suddenly,\nthe player prompt flashes across all\nyour displays.\n\n>>HOODED ANGST has joined the game\n>>KILLER'S CONSCIENCE has joined the game\n>>SHADOW OF DOUBT has joined the game\n>>MR. HOLLYWOOD has joined the game\n>>RA'S AL GOON has joined the game\n>>MRS. NOVOCAINE has joined the game\n\n"Oh boyyy..." Ravemeister anticipates.\n"Oh damn..." The Fatman shivers.\n"Oh no..." you breathe.\n"Oh great." Summer-Rain rolls her eyes.\n\n"STARBOY COLDHEART!" All of them\nshout, seemingly in unison. Ravemeister\nlocks and loads his weapon, while The\nFatman hops into a randomly-spawned\nVTOL. Summer-Rain leaps behind the\nWarthog-lookalike's mounted gatling\ngun and gives you a curt nod which\nmeans "everything will be ok, baby."\nYou hold your rifle as much as you can\nattempt to be confident.\n\n"...you got married..." you state in an\nalmost deadpan manner, your chest\ntight at the sight of the former Ms.\nNovocaine, along with the person\nwhom you thought was your good\nfriend, the low-IQ Ra's Al Goon. In\nbetween them is the devious villain\nMr. Hollywood, an inane director out\nfor the blood of innocents. "Yes,\nStarboy! Your girlfriend is now my\nwife!" Mr. Hollywood gloats, as your\nprevious 'friend' Ra's Al Goon hunches\nover and tries to fire at you like the\ndeformed arab that he is.\n\nDodging, Summer-Rain fires the gatling\ncannon into the air as a warning shot.\n"We're supposed to be on the same\nside if none of us spawn as dinosaurs!"\nShe says with annoyance, shooting\ndirty looks at Ms. Novocaine. As if she\nknew what Summer-Rain was thinking,\nshe fires at Summer-Rain's shoulder,\nmaking her shout in pain and fall from\nthe warthog lookalike's platform.\n\n"SUMMER!" you shout, rushing to her\nside. Ms. Novocaine squints her eyes\nevilly as the countdown timer ends\nand dinosaurs return, spawning.\n\n"It's 'Mrs.' Novocaine now, dear." Mrs.\nNovocaine sneers, before the dinosaurs\napproach and the battle becomes an\nintense free-for-all.  "...and Starboy?"\nYou glare at Mrs. Novocaine amid the\nchaos and draw your rifle on your\nex-girlfriend, her head dead center in\nyour sights. "You were never good\nenough." Mrs. Novocaine sneers again.\n\n"DAMN YOU!" You fire, but a running\nVelociraptor gets hit between you and\nMrs. Novocaine before the dust kicks\nup and dinosaurs and blaster fire rain\nabout everywhere around the both of\nyou. "Summer?! Hang on, ok?!" You\nmotion for her again, and she clasps\nat your arm desperately. You see that\nMrs. Novocaine's shot cut clean through\nSummer-Rain's shoulder and neck, tears\nin her eyes as she bleeds profusely.\n\n"H-help... help, Starboy-" She collapses,\nand you quickly dispatch a Velociraptor\nclosing in on the both of you, with the\nSpinosaurus of this wave charging to\nyour location. "RAVE! SUMMER'S HURT!"\nYou bundle Summer-Rain close to you\nand run to the game's exit. "I'll cover\nyou, Coldheart! The Fatman, get over\nhere bro! Starboy must get back to his\nroom with Summer if it's the last thing\nwe do!"\n\nAs you enter your home from the heavy\nrain pouring outside, Summer-Rain in\nyour arms, you lay her on the couch in\nthe living room and stay by her side.\nYou've applied a makeshift tourniquet\nwith your hoodie as the immersion from\nthe game you've been playing together\nwith everyone vanishes, and her wound\nis somewhat stable. The blood soaks to\nthe couch and the floor, but all you can\nthink of doing is whispering sweet words\nand telling her that you are here, that\nyou attended to her wound as much as\nyou can, and honored her wishes for\nno call to the hospital.\n\n"Let... let me die. Please Starboy. Let\nm-me die." Summer-Rain whispers to\nyou through ragged breaths. "No!" You\nexclaim. "Never! Summer, I love you!"\nYou hold her hand gingerly, and she\nreturns your grasp tightly. "I know.\nThat's... that's the problem, isn't it."\nSummer-Rain mutters, her breathing\nheavy. "What do you mean? If it's\nabout killing the dinosaurs in Prelude,\nyou did a great job with all of us-"\n\n"No Starboy." Summer-Rain heaves\na heavy sigh. "She's right you know."\nYour eyes go wide as Summer-Rain\ntalks to you. "I'm not good enough,\nnot for myself and certainly not\nfor you." She looks at you through\ntired eyes. "I love you so much,\nStarboy Coldheart." she whispers.\n"Don't ever think that you weren't\ngood enough for me, because that's\nwhat I was all this time for you. I love\nyou Starboy Coldheart. Don't you\never forget that." Summer-Rain closes\nher eyes. "Summer?" you whisper.\n\n"SUMMER!" You shout. Summer-Rain\nscrunches her face in annoyance.\n"Starboy, I wanna rest." she responds.\n\nORION: PRELUDE.\n\n","December 20, 2015","true","4.5"," 44 of 65 people (68%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","68","44","65","43","7"

The crazy low price, and the flood of updates make for quite an apology that I can readily accept.  A game that was broken pulled back from the brink is a rare find indeed.\n\nORION: Prelude is basically the combination of Halo and Killing floor reimagined by a 10 year old.  (Not a bad thing)  I'm of course referring to the survival and conquest modes that make up 90 percent of the server list.  There are an overabundance of game modes, some of which I haven't even touched.  But I don't feel like I'm missing much in some of them; but the creators definitely have thought through every possible angle an arena FPS like this could offer.  With that in mind, Orion has a crazy amount of depth for such a cheap game.  With leveling, perks, loadouts, upgrades, the list goes on.  It's got all the bells and whistles of a AAA title, just without the pretty graphics, models, or polish.  And if you don't mind that and just want to cut down a T-rex with a light saber, pistol whip a raptor, or set a pteradon on fire; then this is the game for you.  Did I mention the music is fittingly epic as well?\n\nUnfortunately for this gem, the amount of available players is sparse, so if you do buy it, I would suggest doing so with friends in mind, or firing it up during sale time.","April 25","true","63.9"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","16","17","5","1"

I was a bit confused when I first bought this game. EVERY review said this game was trash, worthless and not even worth playing even if it was free. Almost all reviews gave this game a 1/10, but since it was only 99 cents I figured why not give it a try.\n\nThen I started to play it with a friend of mine and I was amazed! It uses the unreal engine so it lacks graphics. Also the physics are quite terrible. However, if you look at the other aspects of this game, this is probably the most amazing zerg game that exists.\n\nThe game offers A LOT of achievements. For every achievement run player this game is worth it even if it was 10 euro's. It offers great co-op gameplay with many different gameplay options. It's like risk or rain for example. The graphics are terrible but the game offers a system that makes it fun to replay the game, get achievements, unlock abilities and progress every run. For everyone that is not a graphics or storyplayer (read casual), this game is a MUST buy!\n\nOne big thing with this game is the online play. So many people hate it and don't understand the great features of this game that the online play lacks quite a bit. It's hard to find a proper server with random people, so it's easier to play with people you know. I must agree, this game certainly isn't the best game in several aspects, but I'm still able to get a great amount of fun with the replay system. Get achievement, level you character and progress every time you restart a map.\n\nAlso, another great thing about this game is the updates. DLC? What is dlc? ORION doesn't know the term DLC. If you buy this game you don't buy half a game that gets filled with "updates" like most games. "You want to have additional maps or weapons? Sure, but you'll have to pay us another 5 euro's to get those items." A normal way of selling a products in the game industry these days. ORION doesn't give a s**t. This is probably the most updated game there is atm and it won't cost you a single dime. It's all FREE, like it always was, until someone decided that everything had to be paid for. This is a complete game and it grows bigger every time there's an update. It might not be popular, but atleast ORION is a company that cares about their product, rather then screwing over the player base.\n\nOverall, this game gives a great amount of fun. Don't buy this game if you are either a casual, a storyline based player or a player that requires good graphics. For everyone else and especially the hardcore gamer that likes to complete the full game (100%, progress runs) this game is highly recommended.","September 17, 2014","true","27.8"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","23","31","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/preludebot/recommended/104900/","preludebot","PreludeBot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/preludebot/","197 products in account","Short review: It's Killing Floor with dinosaurs and I absolutely love it.\n\nLonger review: Despite a bumpy start upon release and many updates, this game was developed into something great. You essentially fight wave upon wave of dinosaurs while obtaining credits (in-game currency). Using credits to purchase player upgrades, weapons, vehicles and useful items. Some gamemodes include a generator you must defend and other objectives.\n\nNothing really feels over-powered but you will notice that player weapons seem a little more powerful than vehicle weapons. I really only use vehicles to turtle myself and/or as a light defense for the generator. Player vs player battles can be fun but it's easy to take someone out with even mediocre weapons.\n\nMy only real negative for this game is vehicles are way too squishy to larger dinosaurs. A tank takes no more then 3-4 hits before being destroyed and yet can take dozens of hits from smaller dinosaurs before being destroyed. In a way, I appreciate it because it forces you to compromise. I'm all about compromises, it keeps things interesting. See? The only negative I have about this game I honestly turned it into a positive. Overall, I had a lot of fun.\n\nYou'd think flying dinosaurs would be annoying and impossible but they're well balanced.\n\nSimilarly to Killing Floor, every new experience level gives you a small reward like spawning with upgrades, weapons or items. A max level player can spawn with a full loadout of weapons and upgrades. Useful for higher difficulties so obtaining experience and gaining levels is actually worth your while. It's not terribly grindy either, you can reach level 25 in a day. Level 70 is max level.\nPros:Well balanced gameplay.\nWide variety of things to purchase (with in-game currency).\nMultiple gamemodes.\nDecent graphics with nice filters and effects.\nLarge maps that range from canyons to open plains.\nMany different weapons.\nUseful voice commands.\nRewards at each new experience level (Level 70 is max).\nNice sound effects and environment sounds.Cons:Vehicle weapons are slightly weaker than player weapons. The difference is subtle but noticeable. Every game that does this has driven me nuts.\nBots will occassionally get stuck on rocks or other objects when running toward objectives.\nSome objectives have too many dinosaurs which can drag it out for some time... Standing on the point and shooting the occasional compy or raptor until all 300 dinosaurs are dead. This confuses new players who think it's a glitch. It's not a glitch, the point just has too many dinosaurs in the spawn queue.Neutral:PreludeBots aren't always helpful but they're good at being punching bag defenders for the generator.\nAI is somewhat predictable but it can be fun to take down hordes upon hordes.\nTREX rock throw ability is OP but that also keeps things interesting. Dodging is easy enough.\nVehicles are easily destroyed by large dinosaurs. But this makes it more balanced, I think.\nI once hid behind a rock from a TREX and then I saw a jeep hurdling past me.

Previously known as Orion: Dino Horde, and previously known before that as Dino Beatdown. It's a nifty little FPS about...well, the mass killing of dinosaurs.\nThe name changes, despite what the developers will claim on their forums, are repeated attempts to avoid their perpetually low metacritic scores.\nEach iteration of this dino slaughter game is merely just a shameless repackaging, in an attempt to shed it's horrible metagamer score. Perhaps neither here nor there, but it does give you an idea of how dishonest this publisher is willing to be to ensure the game continues to sell.\n\nThe game has a glaring lack of polish, tends to run at very low framerates, even on powerful machines, and has the nasty habit of crashing...repeatedly, for no apparent reason.\nNotably, some people only rarely experience these crashes, but for many people, the game is rendered unplayable. And of course, when you're not crashing, your friends are disconnecting.\nPlaying through a single match of any appreciable length becomes rather difficult.\n\nPair that with the repetitive music and downright embarrasing voices the humans feature, you get the distinct feeling that there was a notable lack of love going into the visuals and sound in this game.\nSeriously, though. The voices are reminiscent of an athsmatic in a bathroom with seasonal allergies and a horrible headcold. (Looking at you, support class! If you call me "homey" one more time...)\n\nNotably, the lag and the crashes and the disconnects are issues that have persisted for me and my friends over a year, since the game was called ORION: Dino Horde.\nIf you are among the lucky people who can play this game without crashing non-stop, then I suggest you immediately stop to thank your lucky stars.\n\nThe game features a variety of modes, but most modes involve slaughtering dinos. (There are a few that allow you to play as dinos.) The game contains 3 classses of humans you can play as, support, assault, and recon. (Think of a clunkier version of Tom Clancy.) While assault is fun to play as with his jetpack, and the recon is nifty with her invisibility, the support class wins hands down, with his ability to heal himself and others....to an extreme degree. He can tank just about anything with his healing gun.\n\nEven though the support class is massively overpowered, playing the game as any other class is quite difficult.\nBetween massive dinos that create unavoidable earthquakes, or even bigger dinos that merely swallow you whole, ORION exists on a strange difficulty spectrum.\n\nSo long as one uses the support class, and uses the turrets on the backs of the vehicles you can ride, the game seems relatively easy. If you, like me, decide to explore what else the game has to offer, you'll run back to your support class/turret combo relatively quickly, as you find that the world of dino horde is quite a cruel one indeed.\n\nIn short, Orion: Prelude, under any name, is a glitchy, laggy, poorly thought out PVP shooter/dino killing game/dinos vs humans, that attempts to excuse its mediocrity with a low price point.\nConsidering the legions of pvp shooters out there, you're probably better off picking up any one of those and leaving this one be.","July 17, 2014","false","13.9"," 101 of 179 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","101","179","4","13"

After that it's problems show. Firstly, the dinos are all very static. Static in the sense that all the dinos ever do is just run at you with the same animations straight at you to attack. No lurking, no ai intelligence. The dinos are like tracking missiles just running directly at you. Next the vehicles feel very basic. The game's mech is a clunky mech which you click to fire a turret which is pretty much the same turret on every vehicle with a turret. The vehicles feel slow and not fun to drive. It is just endless waves repeating after each wave of dinos increasing in number and doing the same thing until you die.\n\nThe game's mechanics could do a little better at some things also, like when a ptero picks you up and flies if u kill it while it is flying it drops u and u die from fall dmg(wth?). Weapons in this game don't feel powerful at all. Imagine just firing at this dino and the dino does not even flinch or stumble. There is just the same blood splatter backwards and you grind him down until he dies. The music is loud and makes it feel like some arcade shootout. Even without the music, the dinos sound even louder than your guns.\n\nThis game is actually just Dino:Beatdown but re-released to try to get more players to buy after dino beatdown got bad reviews.\n\nNow don't get me wrong the game is supposed to be co-op fun, but even with friends after awhile it will be just the whole team split up running in circles around the rocks shooting dinosaurs which are herded behind them.\n\nWhat's good about this game though is that it had a nice concept and could be fun sometimes, but either buy it now at $1 or don't buy at all.","February 22, 2014","false","1.3"," 331 of 611 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","331","611","4","14"

For the $1 I paid for it during the promotion, it's tons of shameless fun (I thought), and a nice deviation from the standard Killing Floor/zombie wave mods out there.  That said, I have to look at this in the context of if it's worth its asking price and...\n\nNo.\n\nThe game is high production value Unreal Engine modification, but it lacks the attention to detail that makes Killing Floor so fun.  Animations are janky, player textures frequently disappear mid-match (leaving behind their primary-colored models), hitboxes are off (why is a shot to the crest of the neck of a raptor considered a headshot, but shooting them in the head isn't?), levels are uninspiring copy-paste affairs (how many times am I going to see the same wrecked drill in a level?) with incredibly linear objective design (Base 2 is always the same spot, as is base 3, etc).  Capturing the bases in Survival mode itself does nothing but progress the game to the next wave of dinosaurs, as even the vehicles spawn at the start of the match - you could have a buddy run to Base 3 for the Mech while you turn on the generator to start Wave One!\n\nThat's not to say the game is /bad/.  Are there performance issues?  Yes.  Is the attention to detail lacking?  Absolutely.  Is it incredibly linear to the point of boredom after a while?  You betcha.  But until you really start to notice those things (about thirty minutes in, for me), the game is still fun in a mindless sort of way, especially with friends.  That said though, for $15, I expect a lot more for my money than copy-pasted levels and textures, braindead AI, movement animations from the original Tribes (in terms of "skating" over terrain), and a linear level experience.\n\nFor the $1 I paid for it, it feels like a discounted iPad app.  Shame that when it's off sale, the developers are still asking for $15 for this thing.  I'd like to see a lot more polish (and better netcode) before plunking down that much cash, especially when you're competing against similarly priced titles like Killing Floor, Starbound, etc, that are way better experiences overall.","February 24, 2014","false","2.5"," 305 of 563 people (54%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","54","305","563","6","18"

Survival is a game mode where you defend your base against waves of dinosaurs that get harder as it throws different types of dinosaurs as you progress.  You can upgrade your guns, items, get turrets, upgrade your character with different perks, and drive vehicles to fight the waves.  One of the best experiences of playing this mode was when I was on top of a bunch of rocks trying to stay out of harms way a terrordactyl picked me up and was taking me who knows where (maybe to just drop me from a height) so I had to spin my character around to kill it.  I thought that was pretty cool.\n\nThe game feels well optimized playing on max settings at 1080 resolution on a dated system I have had no performance issues.  The graphics are not the best but for a dollar with all this game has to offer I think this can be overlooked.\n\nMy last statement, if you are even considering Orion: Prelude please pick it up.  I mean you can even fight others with light sabers, or be a dinosaur in an online pvp dinosaur match.","January 6","true","2.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","8","9","3","0"

Where do I start? I'll start with the most trivial things - graphics.\n\nThey are bad, like bad bad. Low res textures, game looks like late alpha/early beta. It's also poorly optimised and if you don't own a decent gaming rig (like you own an aging gaming laptop) then forget about your game looking anything close to what you can see in the trailer. Even setting everything out ot max makes you feel like all those blurs, blooms, dof effects are to cover how ugly this game actually is.\n\nGraphics are not deciding here, let me move on with the review.\n\nGameplay is extremely boring and unsatysfying. Killing dinosaurs? That's cool. Well how about any progress, strategy, real objectives? All of that was replaced by run and fly tactic (also exploiting bugs and broken pathing of enemies), pretty much all the guns feel the same (like bb toys) and objectives are just to have a laugh at them every once in a while. Go the ♥♥♥♥ to the objective, stay there for 15 secs, get nothing but a vehicle so you can run back to the base asap. Wow, jesus!\n\nEnemies? All the ♥♥♥♥ing same, slaying a t-rex doesn't give any satisfaction whatsoever but some slow-motion for 15 seconds straight so you can meditate on your miserable life, since you're still playing this game and wasting your time.\n\nAudio is just crap. I think you can easily tell that by watching some gameplay video. I'm not going to ♥♥♥♥ around with onomathopeyas.\n\nBtw. Watching the trailer again - haven't you noticed this actually trolling? Who would believe this is "the most fantastic game" anyone ever played? It's not, unless it was this guy's first game. "So cool I love it"? Now that's a cool quote. "The metacritic score is misleading"? Of course it is, this game is 2/10 at best.\n\nLook, getting this game for its current price is kinda a bargain.

It's not well-explained where you are or why dinosaurs are attacking your base (especially the herbivorous ones, like Stegosaurus and Triceratops), but that perhaps misses the point: shooting dinosaurs. This aspect feels pretty solid; big dinosaurs are hard to deal with and can easily kill you, little ones surround you and can take you down in a short period of time. I'll tackle major aspects of the game below instead of a list of pros and cons. If you're looking for deep gameplay, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a little bit of fun, especially with friends, this is well worth your one dollar (but perhaps not much more). OVERALL: 5/10\n\nGameplay 6/10\nI've only ever played the standard co-op wave survival game type (with bots and/or friends), but there are other game modes. Each of three classes has a specific ability and set of weapons, which are adequately differentiated. Difficulty scales nicely over the ten waves, and rewards for defeating dinosaurs allows you to purchase weapons, turrets, and/or item upgrades. This all feels pretty good, but the weapons could be slotted into 4/5 categories which feel almost exactly the same. Vehicles (which seem mostly ripped from Halo's assets) are an interesting addition and are fun to use, but somewhat difficult to steer. Dinosaurs' models match their power level neatly, and you'd better be packing top-tier weapons when more than two at a time are nearby. Killing an enemy while downed allows a self-revive in addition to teammates' ability to revive you.\nOne of my biggest issues with this game is the AI. The dinosaurs will not know what to do if you are outside of their attack range and will waggle back and forth below seemingly forever. Cloaking immediately breaks aggro of ANY dinosaur and seems to prevent re-acquiring you as a target for a few seconds. Teammate AI is even worse. They rarely revive you, fail to efficiently capture points, routinely fail to headshot dinosaurs sitting in front of their face, and have garish joke outfits like sandwich hats and wizard cloaks. Playing with bots is really only worth it for two reasons: they aggro dinosaurs and can (for some reason) accurately take down dinosaurs flying at/near the game ceiling.\n\nGraphics: 5/10\nLooks solid most of the time, but things get wonky when dinosaurs die, and when playing in 3rd person. Switching weapons results in a very low-quality model for the first second or so. Dino models are solid, character models less so, (bot costumes -> horrific). Environment looks good all around, weather effects look great, but hinder visibility in ways that are counterproductive to a FPS.\n\nMusic/Sound: 4/10\nI have only ever heard two songs in this game, both of which are rousing and I quite like. If you didn't like them, they'd get old fast.\nSound is less good overall. Sound balance is wonky: one pistol is about twice as loud as every other weapon; T-Rex roars seem to badly clip the audio (and my eardrums); slow-mo start sound blares unreasonably. Could be better balanced and menu audio options don't seem to affect all sounds. Everything else is solid, but leaves something to be desired.\n\nPerformance: 4/10\nThe game seems to be very poorly optimized and freezes for a few seconds when awarding class level ups, and uses far more system resources than I would expect from a game like this.","January 3, 2015","true","20.4"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","13","20","2","5"

Wrong! while this game has some good qualities to it, there are far too many bugs/ issues with it to even consider playing in a more consistent capacity, with there being far more capable FPS for free on steam. You would think with the 99 cent price tag that the game is worth a shot and your right. But when you get in game and notice that the game also has in game purchases for cosmetics and everything else, bugs and very unrefined yet basic system. You'll be wondering why you even payed the $1 in the first place. Luckily I was one of the thousands of people who got this game for free and thankfully that means that I got free trading cards for my time spent playing the game. before I get to the pros and cons of this game, I'd like to put some of the comments in retrospect from my experience.\n\nThis game has been compared to Halo, Borderlands, Killing floor, Jurassic park and a plethora of other AAA/ popular games.\n\nTo clarify things for the hyped up buyer. This game is as similar to those games combines as power puff girls is to street fighter. To put some things into terms this game retains a cap of roughly 300 players per day, while the original Halo on PC still caps out at 400 users daily. So if your looking for Halo. Then just go back to the original PC community as it is still alive my friend.\n\nSure this game has guns, but the shooting is generic and it's not realistic nor is it futuristic. The game can be played with the starting pistol and not challenge the user very much as he sits on a rock and kills all the boss dinos and everything in between. Even when I force myself to stay on the ground, the AI is poorly executed, even while on the hardest difficulties.\n\nPros and Cons.\n\nPros:\n*The game is fairly cheap.\n*The community is not dead for now.\n*The developers may fix all the issues at some point.\n*The developers give away thousands of copies of the game monthly, so you can expect new and exciting users to keep playing with while the fun lasts.\n*The graphics are quite nice for the price\n*You get a cute little shooter for 99 cents\n\nCons:\n*Even on a high performance gaming computer, this game does not function well in full screen what so ever.\n*The game forces it to launch in full screen no matter how many time you toggle it to windows.\n*The clipping isn't rendered correctly on full screen\n*The audio is horrible and often drops/ cuts out from gun fire to dino roars.\n*The vehicle control is highly generic and most often comparable to Halo 1(That's a lie) The vehicle controls are far worse than the original halo games, or almost any early shooter for that mater.\n*Full controller support is true, although it's highly glitchy and the controls don't always seem to register when using a controller vs mouse and keyboard.\n*combat is often boring and tedious as the AI is one of the worse AI's I've seen in a FPS.\n\n\nI could keep listing things wrong with the game but there is too many other games I could be playing during this time. I do hope that the developer takes the time to buckle down and release a good patch to fix most of the issues as the majority of them are common features in thousands of games that have way less funding/ following.\n\nMy advice is simple, if you want a fps with dinosaurs in it. Then buy a game that has mods for dinosaurs in it. Like Star Wars Battlefront II or Arma II.

Is a game about killing dinosaurs, lots of them. Wave after wave. While that may seem boring it's lots of fun. Even tho it's dumb fun. It's the kind of game you would think you would see on the first Xbox consol. Just you and some friends, sitting on a sofa eating a pizza, and playing this game as a split screen co'op game. It is a throwback in every sense of the word and feels like a dinosaur come back to life. Showing us what we used to enjoy, and still can. While the game looks and feels dated, that's part of the fun. It really feels like you playing an Xbox game with your old friends. The dinosaurs are fairly well done, and i did not see anything strange, like mushrooms growing out of them. Tho you have to wonder why they throw away the life god gave them to distroy a power generator. But that's also part of the fun. The unrealisticness.\n\n\n\nReview\n\nPros:\n-It's fun to play\n-Has dinosaurs\n-Has cars tanks and flying things\n-Has a lightsaber\n-Dinosaurs are well done and look good (other then Trex throwing rocks)\n-Game devs are still working on it and updating. Even with the rock bottom price\n-Most of the guns are fun to use\n-Jetpacks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n-It's a kind of game you could play for hours with a friend or two\n\nCons:\n-Poorly optimized\n-Some guns suck\n-Some of the dinosaurs have really random things like the Trex throwing a rock (it would break all of its teeth!)\n-Flying dinosaurs are too weak\n-The flying plane is unbalanced\n-Not as fun without friends\n\n\nVerdict:\nIf you have any friends who PC game you should get the 4 pack, and all play it together. If you are more of a lone wolf, then this game may not hold the same appeal. That said it's only $0.99 so it's not a masive investment.

But, nope. Orion Prelude isn't about any of those things. Now, I know what you're going to say. "Hold on there one second, Contorted. If it's not awesome, intriguing or fantastic, how is it a good game" Well, let me tell you. Usually when playing Call of Duty, Far Cry, Halo, you name it. I sometimes find myself thinking. "Isn't this practically another one of those stories but just happening a different way? I mean, you start the game out not knowing what the ♥♥♥♥'s going on, a villian is introduced. Somewhere down the line he does something terrible and probably kills off one of your mates and then you ♥♥♥♥ him up for it and the game ends with you walking cockily into the distance?" With Orion, that kind of every-day ♥♥♥♥ doesn't happen. It's the simplicity and almost childlike logic on which the game prides itself on that makes it somewhat charming. It's one of the only games I've ever played that actually exists simply for fun and, somehow, the lack of anything huge or emotionally powerful happening actually works towards aplifying that charming simplicity. It literally exists for FUN.\n\nHowever, the game isn't perfect. The lack of logic may work towards the game's advantage and atmosphere, but in some places it does get a little annoying. The slightest nudge from a T-Rex can send you flying to the other side of the map screaming "To infity and ♥♥♥♥ you" in the opposite direction. Also, the idea that a flying Dinosaur that's about the size of a large Human can push away an air-based vehicle that's about five times its' size never fails to floppify my action boner. But, once again, these annoying little pockets of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is what makes it all the more satisfying when you unload enough bullets into the Dinosaurs that are coming at you to kill them and they flop dead to the ground. Watching a flying Dino fall about five hundred feet and splat on a rock never fails to make me giggle. Also, one of the most, and I can't find another word to describe it, 'epic' game mechanics ever is the fact that, when a teammate dies, or you kill a T-Rex or Spinosaurus, the screen flops into slow-motion. Why? Because it makes killing a Dinosaur all the more awesome when its' body falls limp in slow motion.\n\nOverall, Orion: Prelude is a fun little game, which is very childlike, but also quite charming and adorable to play. It's like you're one of the Spartans from Halo, stuck into a game of Primal Carnage, but you have a jetpack, medigun or a massive, armoured vehicle to help you out.","May 22","true","48.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Then grab your high powered bow cause its killing time.\n\nA simple arcane like defense came where you gain credits after every round to buy new skills and perks along with weapons depending on your class (and some neutral ones that everyone can buy) to help you survive the increasing hordes of small an large dinosaurs.\n\nFeaturing a couple game types, you defend a generator from waves of enemies with vehicles and weapons. They perks allow certain feats to be obtained, like jumping high, being able to heal machines (as a medic) and many many more.\n\nSeveral different types of dinosaurs are present in this game, like pterodactyls, raptors, t-rex and spinosaurus. Depending on the round and which objective is present, certain dinos will spawn. These large giants are considered the bosses of the game, having very high health pools and insanely high damage.\n\nWhile the game isn't hard to master, and very easy to understand, I found it got boring playing by yourself or with random people online. I would recommend playing with a friend or two if you can.\n\nIts really cheap when its not on sale and a steal when it is.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Desolon/recommended/104900/","Desolon","Desolon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Desolon/","217 products in account","So I see a ton of reviews stating that "This game is fun! This game is Awesome!! Best Co-oop ever!", but none of them give you any details at all. I see some that do, but it annoys me that they put up a 'release' video that has multiple reviews doing just what I hate. Don't get me wrong though, I do love the idea of showing the communities love for a game by putting their name on the video, but at the same time it's bad. I'll get to the point though, the review of the game via pro and con list.\n\nPros:\nThe game is 0.99c.\nIt has co-op in so many ways.\nIt has pvpve.\nit has hordes of dinos.\nIt is satisfying to kill a bunch of dinos with a big gun/tank.\nThere are lots of weapons.\nConquest mode has a very interesting concept.\nIt has the old announcer styled "Double Kill, Triple Kill, ect".\n\nCons:\nThere is a bug that allows your "Private" server to become a public server without warning.\nThere is no way to change the audio for the Dino's seperately from the other audio so if your game volume isn't low the T-rex will kill your ears.\nFor all the guns, there are really only about 10 you will ever use.\nIf one person is killing all the dinos they get all the money, and can share it, but usually won't since the good weapons cost so much.\nGetting a tank is a savior just as much as a death wish, as you can die in seconds to anything larger than the acid spitting dinos.(T-rex, stega, ect.)\nGetting stuck on spots is very likely.\nThe tank's machine gun is ear ♥♥♥♥ much like the large dino roars.\nThe Mech is awesome looking but will die even faster than a jeep without a gun will.\nThere are turrets, but they only last for 60seconds.\nThey have an apc that does tons more damage than the tank, and has seats that are supposed to allow passangers to shoot from, but they do not, and it has a main gun that was apparently taken out so the main weapon has a non-functional cannon on it now.\nThe most viable way of killing dinos is running them over, but that will get you far far far less credits so you will be less useful versus large dinos.\nThere are still other bugs that have not been adressed.\nControllers still do not function properly with the game.\nThe new update has brought in even more bugs than before it seems.\nThis is supposedly the 3rd time the game has been 'redone' or whatever they would like to call it, and the ammount of change is so pitifully small that it's not worth mentioning.\n\nSo after putting all that in, I'll say this for my final words. I have played the game quite a bit, I'm lvl20+, which I didn't put as a pro or con because I didn't think of it as especially one or the other. I have used most of the weapons except for a select few that I just have not wanted to use at all. I've played all the co-op maps so far for survival and conquest. I can say this from my experience. I would not pay 99c to play this game. It is fun for a short while, but after you get frustrated with it, and after you realize how buggy and glitchy the game is. You and your friends will quickly move onto other games, and the fact that they have renamed it(for reasons I didn't look into as I didn't really care.) along side pricing it at 99c now, makes me feel like they have possibly given up on fixing anything with it, and just want to squeeze this lemon for it's last drops of juice. They put out a fancy trailer that recognizes the positive short review from the community, and left it at that.\nSo I say keep your dollar, and buy something else. This game will most likely rot in your steam library like it has mine. It has become that game that me and a few friends play for about 1hour every 2-3 months then forget it again because we hate the bugs and glitches.","August 25, 2014","false","13.3"," 71 of 133 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","71","133","5","1"

Many people buy games like this to play with their friends and such, but this game is great with and without friends. There is a diverse range of gamemodes and maps with a large selection of weapons and vehicles. Zoom around in your jetpack or revive your teammates or go incognito and tactically take out some dinosaurs or enemies. Customise your player model with hats and armour types. Who wouldnt want to do that? This game has great visuals and fantastic gameplay. Like seriously? Who doesnt have fun running dinosaurs over in jeeps and taking a t-rex down in a mech suit? Who doesnt love burning little raptors to a crisp?

The ratings and scores the game has received and the complaint has misled me far too much that I cannot fathom anything else but my remorse for not purchasing this game earlier to see for myself.\n\nDisclaimerI received the game within a bundle, because I simply wanted to support charity. And then it was left to dust.\nThe reviewUpon picking up on it and giving it a try, I must say it is certainly one of the very captivating and playful experiences I have ever had. The sizes of the reptiles is rather unrealistic, that you'd think the developers prioritized this game into a source of entertainment, a game by definition, rather than a lesson in jurassic era which is a no-no according to the critics.\nI'd say the game is a slight mix of 'Turok the dinosaur hunter', 'Halo' (Combat Evolved if I may, as we all kept dear), as well as a petite slice of Crysis. And spice it up with a bit of Serious Sam.\n\nThe verdictThe graphics is astonishing, the animation is charming, the menu is nostalgic, along with the audio. There's these encouraging shouts when doing double, triple kills, endorsing your irrational lifelong dream of dinosaur or cyborg massacre.\nAnd lens flares. The pretty kind.","June 21, 2014","true","27.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djtekaP/recommended/104900/","djtekaP","Appley Hooves™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djtekaP/","729 products in account","This game has a lot of bad press about it, and it doesn't deserve it as much as it did in the past. Things have gotten a lot better since ORION: Dino Beatdown, and even from the original release of ORION: Dino Horde (which people got for free if they already had O:DB, so check if you already have it from the previous name), and the amount of fun you have with the game is linked to your disposition to it.\n\nIf you go in thinking it's going to be a terrible game, you're not going to have fun with it. If you think it could be good, then you'll probably give it more of a chance. There's been a lot of updates and additions that probably fixed something you didn't like about it before. (I'm looking at you, TotalBiscuit, and everyone that follows him blindly about his first impressions.)\n\nWith that said, this can be a lot of fun with friends, playing by yourself is okay, but it really shines with more people. If you get on Skype/TeamSpeak with some pals (because who uses in-game voice chats anymore, really?), you can coordinate and assist each other in your fight against waves of dinosaurs who apparently find the noise/smell of your energy generators really annoying/tasty. I've found it to be an enjoyable alternative to Killing Floor or especially any of the modes in the CoD games (save for MW1 or BO2).\n\nSure, it's had a past behind it, and there's some concepts borrowed from other games, but if you wait for a sale (namely right now, it's free to play for the week of Feb 20-27, and you can have it forever if you pay a single dollar), then maybe you can justify the purchase. Personally, I don't think that it's worth it at full price, but once it goes under 50% discount, that should ease the hesitation. Now go ahead and try it on a sale (maybe get a 4-pack to share), bring some friends along, don't be a filthy public match joiner.","February 21, 2014","true","27.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","1"

I randomly decided to try it once more, after its update to the new title to see if it was still okay.\n\nThe menu UI for the game, with the transition, feels like it under went a 15+ year regression compared to what it was previously. They had a fairly sleek UI previously, that overall looked decent for a modern age game, and it functioned well enough, and now the new UI looks like something that might have been taken straight out of the late 90s, maybe early 2000s.\n\nAside from that, the views while in the game, at least to me, went from feeling like a decent first/third shooter to feeling just cramped.  I could be wrong on what I recall on this point, but I remember having a wider field of vision for both first and third person views, and even as a spectator floating around, I recall a wider view than what is shown.\n\nOn the positive side, it is still a good game for the price.. it just feels more deserving of that price now, instead of feeling like an amazing game for the price. If you need something to entertain you for a couple of hours, this will certainly do it, especially for the price on it.","October 11, 2014","false","124.8"," 104 of 198 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","104","198","5","7"

This game, at launch was very buggy and needed a lot of content. The devs have made up for it and have cerrtainly improved the game a lot. I suggest this game A LOT. The metacritic is also another misleading score, it reflects the original games score, but the game has evolved quite a bit since then.\n\nWhy should you buy it? This game is for people that like games like Killing Floor that send the players against waves of enemies that keep getting stronger wave after wave, occasionally there will be a boss dino which will be quite the destruction machine. My own suggestion is to play this game with stranger and/or friends, since the singleplayer can feel a bit devoid of hummanity.","March 2, 2014","true","5.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

There's lots of different game modes, plenty of weapons and augmentations, a few vehicles, three classes of characters with different abilities, 50 levels of character unlocks, several levels of difficulty, and even Borderlands style second wind.

It's pretty fun and works about as much as dino d day does.\n\nThe survival mode is where the game shines. You fight increasingly hard waves of dinos as you try to defend yourselves and various generators around the map. The maps are huge and the graphics are really nice to the eye.\n\nRight off the bat, the HUD looks like it was straight from Halo. The gameplay is a mix of Borderlands, Left 4 Dead, Serious Sam, and even TF2. When you go down, you have to either revive your teammate, or kill a dino to get back up, similar to Borderlands. The game is highly customizable, and is insanely fun.\n\nThe Metacritic score can go ♥♥♥♥ itself.

The map has vehicles scattered all around and each map is different and the effect that comes with it makes it more appealing.\n\n\n"Peak" is a winter map and your visor can get frozen while playing and this forces you to search for a warm place to melt the ice off. The light reflecting off the snow also makes it harder to spot smaller dinos.\n"Raupi" is a tropical map where rain starts to pour in mid game. Really gotta love the rain droplet effect on your visor and the weather makes it hard to spot the pterodactyls flying overhead.\nDuring each round you'll get to access upgrades and different weapons while they throw at you different types of dinos that range from velociraptors to T-Rexs.\n\nHowever, if you're playing in Asia, you might find the servers lacking in number. You can still host listen servers or play singleplayer with bots.\n\n\nI'd say i got my money's worth from this game at that flash sale price ^_^","December 23, 2014","true","5.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Actually, that was the review in its entirety. An honest review of this game would be that it is a stupid buggy mess, that has its moments, but even when it has those moments, they're a result of the game's utter lunacy. Put that on the box and quote me with it. That said, you'd think I hate the game. You couldn't be more wrong. ORION is to Transformers (Bay Films) as Matt Damon is to a heaping pile of fecal matter. What exactly that means, I'm not sure; and I really only thought through the first bit of that analogy, but what I'm getting at here is that ORION: Beatdown/Horde/Prelude/WorkingTitle is stupid fun.

ORION: Prelude gave me more time of enjoyment than an Arizona ice tea for the same price.\n\nPLEASE READ: I didn't caculate the amount of enjoyment that one may find playing with the aluminum can after the liquid is consumed.  Activities like squishing it aganist your head, stomping on it, cutting it open than poking your friends with the sharp edge and playing the game where you flick the can opener to see if you can flick it off.

By now it’s really damn straight worth one dollar. I like the sun lighting in the game as well as the ability to upgrade your character and use weapons like sentry guns and rocket launchers to mow down waves of enemies. The game does have some downsides as it's still kinda buggy.\n\nNow the “conquest” game mode is something to have a lot of fun about. Try beating that before you leave the game. The game gets even more fun when you level up your character and start spawning with weapons that you would normally have to buy. I also like the fact that you can customize your armor style and give yourself a hat and a cape so that you can look like a badass when fighting dinos. It gets pretty fun in high level games.\n\nThe only downside to this game is that it's still kinda buggy.

Fortunate for me, this is a unique and fun shooter game, and all the problems I had did not subtract the overall fun I had with the game.\n\nORION: Prelude is a game in which you shoot dinosaurs (or robo-santa in the Christmas map), but it is not a normal game with team deathmatch or anything. The player (and any friends or internet people, as this game has the multiplayer option) faces 10 waves of dinosaurs while buying weapons and upgrades. However, there are many different gameplay modes, many which I still need to experience.\n\nThe game has good controls, if with a bit of a delay and a bit sluggish, but the sluggish controls can usually be fixed by editing the mouse sensitivity. The graphics are okay, and the dinosaurs looks rather stupid and not very well animated, to be honest (the bigger bosses in particular). However, they get the job of being a hitbox done pretty well.\n\nThe sound and music is decent enough. Nothing spectacular, but worth listening to if you want to. However, where this game pulls through is the actual gameplay itself. It is incredibly satisfying to shoot dinosaurs and buy weapons, with loads of different weapons to try. The player can have different lives and be revived or, in a similar way to COD Zombies, take down one dinosaur to be revived with all weapons. Anyway, this game is designed for multiplayer, but the genius fact about the game is that there are bots in both modes. Therefore, when playing single player, bots will help you take down dinosaurs, and they actually are well programed and an actual help, which is a problem in a lot of games with bots on your team. Also, there is loads of content (different gamemodes and quite a few different maps), as well as achievements for those who like to collect those sorts of things.\n\nIn total, this game entertaining buy and is certainly worth buying and revisisting from time to time. Playing it with friends is a good idea, but not required to enjoy the game, as there is single player and random online lobbies. Anyway, there are some hinderances, such as the sound, the graphics, and glitches (I didn't mention any yet, but I have heard of some glitches from others and have experienced a glitch myself in which the upper half of the screen has a purple tint. The purple tint is easily fixed by using ctr + alt + delete and to go to your desktop and then just entering the game again with no restart or anything). However, these can all be ignored and leave a fun game that can certainly be fun for a good while and kill time.

The narrative is excellent, one in which all games should follow. The scenes have so much depth to them and when jimmie was molested by a pterodactyle i may of even shed a tear. The attachments that you grow with the players is like no other game i've ever experienced. The title of this game is extremly misleading, i thought it was going to be a wrestling game but i found out it was no other than a RSPCA animal saving simulator. The crew is incharge of rescueing the remaining dinosaurs of southern uzbekistan. One of the standout scenes of this game was when the raptor had recieved a splinter in his foot. You could see that the team were really doing their job, helping out with the local wildlife. Not only is this game compelling in both its narrative and its gameplay it also manages to be one of the must humour-filled experiences of my life. I couldnt help emitting into a cacophony of laughter clawing my eyes out in hysterics, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ uncontrollably. There was even one stage when me and my friends where laughing so hard we liquified and proceeded to melt into a puddle together amongst feces, urine and blood. Samuel L Blackson also makes a cameo aswell as amanda todd, trying to join the crew. I still cant believe this was only 10 dollars, aswell as the extremly raving metascore it recieved. This is definataly my GOTY for 2012, and i have already logged over 2,300 hours. This game has shifted me as a person into a new form, and provided me with enjoyment of monumental levels. Im very grateful that the developers removed dino pubes in patch 3 or this game wouldnt be as enjoyable. With a trilogy in the makes and a movie directed by Steven Spielberg, aswell as its extraordinarily amazing soundtrack produced in studio by mozart and beethoven and snoop dogg (snoop lion). Aswell it is now sponsored by burger king, with their new Onion-Rings-In-Oil-Now item and Mountain dew's patented Dino Dew.\nThis Is As Good As It Gets. 100/100","December 11, 2012","true","11.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","5","7","3","2"

Ride vehicles,Be a dinosaur,Be a human,choose from a large choice of weapons, so many gamemodes to choose from, (adding more apparently)\n\nCO-OP/Online Multiplayer - The spiral community seems to be one of the nicer end of the web game communities, playing online with friends/random peeps is always fun, there is always so much going on.\n\nSound- The dialogue in this game (while little), is just a JOY to listen to, the 3 human classes all have something funny to say at the best of times,the music can sometimes be good, and the announcer, oh , the announcer, I won't dare spoil what he says when you get a 10+ kill streak, but it had me laughing for at least 30 seconds.\n\nUpdates- I have never see any other developer update the game in so many good ways in such a short period of time, whether it being open worlds, new weapons, more detail in-game. As soon as I see this game update, I play it, just to see\nwhat they've added, and usually stay in for ages as I get hooked into it.\n\nBad Points:\nSingle Player- Sadly, this is what kinda lets it down for me, it is advertised as a "Single-player" game, and for me, it really isn't all that special, as it's basically the same mode as in co-op, just, on your own, *Insert forever alone face here*, also, here are many modes you CANNOT play alone.\n\nSound(again)- However, some of the sound kinda lets it down, the dino sounds are quite poor, and often lacking from some, the music is OK but some sounds really need to be fixed, (If you're wearing headphones, like I was, be ready\nfor a T-Rex roar, it will break your headphones)\n\n\nWell, this is my first in-depth review, and for a good reason; this game doesn't deserve that 36/100 stamped on this page, if your interested in dinosaurs, good online play, or just a variety of things to do in a game, here's my advice to you;\n\n1. Wait for this game to go for a F2P weekend/watch some UPDATED gameplay videos.\n2. Buy it in a sale (Last time it was 99p!)\n\n\nFinal words; I paid 99p in a sale for this, I would gladly pay the £11.99 for it, if the updates continued as good as this, and just for the sheer joy factor :)\n\nThanks for reading! (Or, going into the comments just to rage about me talking about the rating of this game)","March 27, 2014","true","22.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

I started off with the DM mode which was quite good and after that I was basically playing survival mode with my friends, it was fun chasing the small dinosaurs, flying dinos, huge dinos, and others.

Not to mention there are a variety of game modes, the most exciting (for me) being survival mode, where increasingly large waves of dinosaurs arrive in game to munch on you. On harder game levels the battles are so intense you find yourself narrowly escaping with your life by killing a t-rex just before he chomps down on you, or getting ground stomped by a stegosaur that sends your vehicle flying through the air...but it is okay because you got a jet-pack!\n","June 6, 2014","true","158.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","1"

It's freakin' awesome.  I'd say it's like Halo meets a Tower Defense game (with one one tower to defend, and I'm pretty sure it doesn't shoot), set in Jurassic Park after the dinosaurs broke out, but without all those pesky fences.\n\nIn essence, X number of dinosaur waves come at your team (10-30-infinite I believe), and after each wave, your team has a chance to purchase weapons and upgrades.  There are also upgrades you can get for you whole account/player, but I've only gotten one so far, so I don't want to give any misinformation; I can't recall what I achieveved to get the upgrade.  That's how they work though, accomplish an "acheivement" and then in the future you'll always have that upgrade the "acheivement" granted you.\n\nI won't give too much away, but the vehicles are ALL awesome, and the whole game is loads of fun.  Not to mention, look in their "recent updates" area of thier Steam page: "Buy ORION: Dino Horde, Get ANOTHER Game FREE!"  Read it.  Enough said.\n\nBuy this while on sale and you won't regret it.  If I knew it was this good, I would have probably already have bought it before Steam's "Sales" section got me again.\n\nIt's the best game I've ever gotten on Steam for $0.99, and it's better than a lot of current FPS big name titles.\n\nBuy it.  Play it.  You won't regret it.  At least try the free 2 days!","February 25, 2014","true","3.5"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","21","39","0","1"

The game has had a revival since then, and has gotten much better as a game. Having not actually played the earlier version, I personally find it hard to believe that a game so creative and well made could ever deserve the terrible metascore and overall hate that Dino Horde has recieved. This really is a great game, it probably won't be on a top five FPS list any time soon, but for people that love science fiction shooter games with simple objectives and a gun purchase system like in CS:GO, then this is the game for you. It also has dinosaurs in it, so that's a plus.\n\nEdit: This review is for dino horde.

It was one of the first early access games that I purchased and my friend and I had a blast killing dinosaurs. You used to be able to purchase vehicles as well as weapons. For whatever reason they took out the vehicle purchasing building. There are still vehicles, but they are spread out across the map in little outpost like areas. You could say it makes it more challenging. I would say it takes away a bit of the tactical choices and freedom of playing the game the way you like. When I played the community wasn't huge, but usually saw a pretty high uptick in players when it went on sale. There are a lot worse games for $0.99 or less. I would recommend this game, if you you have a friend that would like to blow away a bunch of dinosaurs with you.

Well-balanced classes, weapons and enemies is the most important part of a shooter, and this game has it. It's a little bit confusing at the beggining, but when you get used to it it's a easy to play.\n\nThe only thing I dislike is the heavy GPU usage. It maxes out my 760 and only gives about 70fps, which is about the same as I get in BF4. The graphics are not something amazing, but good enough to not ruin the experience.\n\nOverall, this is an amazing game, well worth the 80 cents it costs. The developers are great people, pricing this game at such a low price, while it is surely worth at least 5x more and I respect that very much.

Anyways, Humans have 3 Classes, Each class with it's upgrades and special Skills! 7 or 8 Vehicules! 12+ Guns and taunts!\n= Fair Graphics\n+ Good singleplayer\n- Microtransactions ( i really hate that! where's the time where skins would be unlocked by a special challenge/ mission?)\n+ Different gameplays\n+ Several modes\n+ Workshop\n+ Several maps\n= Taunts ( depends on your view of Taunts i personally hate them )\n+ Good XP system\n+ Cheap price ( well in my time at least! I heard it's going to be $20 in the next few months )\nSo get it on sale or not, it is worth the money!","March 18, 2015","true","45.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Since I was so forced to get this game, I needed it ASAP. I couldn't sell any skins on the market because I met my max, so I gave the skin to my friend and he gifted me the game because he could sell it. He then continued to give me a note with the gift. So poetic that I first thought he copied and pasted it off a Shakespeare sonnet. The message read:\n\nDear Zaque,\nPlease kill yourself, drink bleach, overdose, etc.\n\nXOXOXO\n-♥♥♥♥♥♥\n\n\nThis stunned me because he has never written something so poetic in our english classes. I then downloaded the game after multiple thoughts of suicide and right when I opened the game, I knew I made a great decision. Orion Prelude was written next to multiple dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes that I wish I knew wtf they were. Should've payed more attention in the third grade. I then changed all the settings to be fully optimized to run on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the PC I have. I was then invited by my friends and a few other ♥♥♥♥♥ to play some co-op. I joined the game and a stegosaurus had one of its multiple stages of her menstual cycle on me. I had no clue what to do,  I was lost, just like in real life, So I knew I was screwed. I instantly panicked and I ended up getting puked on by a so called "Spitter". This motha♥♥♥♥a's puke looked like it drank 3 gallons of AMP before this battle. Puked like it just had its night out on Las Dino. I learned some of the mechanics of the game, and got the hang of it, but I pressed one button that ruined my dignity, V. I pressed V and I was introduced by a melee that looked like my guy was a 9 year old child trying to kill a butterfly. You're telling me they are trained to fight dinosaurs and robot santas, but yet swing like Ronda Rousey. Jesus H christ. Besides the hideous so called "melee" animation was horrific, there wasn't too much else. Other than me getting stuck in a rock for 10 hours while my buddies kicked some prehistoric ♥♥♥. I got stuck in a rock because a wolf gave me a bruce lee kick to the back and sent me off a mountain into a pile of rocks. Also of course, I was a support or medic so I couldn't jetpack myself out. I sat there for a good hour taking a roast session. My friends called me a poon and said I should kill myself. BUT, this game is actually very nice for the money. This game passes time easily and is super addicting with friends. Graphics are very similar to Borderlands, and I like it.","December 23, 2015","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

You could say it makes it more challenging. I would say it takes away a bit of the tactical choices and freedom of playing the game the way you like. When I played the community wasn't huge, but usually saw a pretty high uptick in players when it went on sale. There are a lot worse games for $0.99 or less.

I recently picked up Trek Industries newest game, which is in early access and I was impressed by what I saw so I thought I'd delve into ORION: Prelude to see what I could expect from them in the development of that game.\n\nWhen you know about the history of ORION: Prelude the state it's in now is pretty impressive. The developer clearly worked hard to turn something that was unplayable into a game that is actually really fun. There's no real depth to it but it's a slightly different take on your average horde mode game, the mechanics are solid and there's a nice variety of maps.\n\nIt is only 79p so you can't really go wrong if you want to sink a few hours into a decent game that has a small but fairly active multiplayer community.

Animations are, pretty sub par, and there are some questionable bugs in the game that break it, and, it's soundtrack is forgettable.  But ignoring those features to the basic bits, you've got a game built around co-op that has a competitive feature.  The co-op includes the 3 classes where each one contributes to the game in a major way.  Recons eliminate dinos and do stealthy revives/repairs on the generator.  Supports are the only class that can heal anyone on the team, as well as tanking with their beefy life.  Assault, well, it's pretty basic, he goes places fast and kills things fast.  Competitive allows the player to play as the dinosaurs too, which is actually kind of fun, though I must say I haven't had much experince in that department.\n\nOverall, all I can say is, you get a pretty good laugh and great feeling after you punch a T-rex in the face and either A. Kill it, or B. It eats you and regains life.\n\n7.5-8/10 It does need work, but hell, it makes you laugh and it has a good core.","July 12, 2014","true","114.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Still there's at least a fundamentally good game at the core.\nThe HUD needs some better iconography (I had to guess at what the heck the two bars were), the animation completely ruins the look for me and the sound effects are absolutely terrible. Gameplay-wise the general mode seems to be Survival (I just tried that solo) where you have to protect or otherwise secure objectives from marauding waves of dinosaurs, with opportunities to buy character perks or equipment as you go. There are also some PvP modes and an apparent laundry list of features in this here store page, but they aren't elaborated much in game.\nIt's kind of like Killing Floor in a Turok setting, but with terrible production values. If you're looking for the next bit of fun to spend 99 cents on, I'd certainly say okay.\nSure, it's artistically strongly inspired, but uncreative ideas don't necessarily mean bad ones.","February 21, 2014","true","27.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is like Gears of War Horde mode but more crap thrown in. Weapon cost is extremely high, and the "defend points" are never near any actual defensible position. If you have 4 or more people playing it can be good, but it still seems very lackluster. In my opinion not worth $1.","June 5, 2014","false","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Said flaws include average gameplay, bad dinosaur AI, terrible animations, poor sounding, poorly excecuted ingame features and the list goes on. Its like primal carnage or Dino D-day just more terrible and with crack down skin over it just with all the good elements ripped out. Overall its a bad game, but it isn't terrible as its fun at some points as its a basic shooter and can be thrilling when you are taking on the big dinosaurs like Spinosaurus, Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus and Deinosuchus to name all the boss dinosaurs. For the causal gamer this is an ok pick up. For £1 its a steal so I would suggest picking it up when its on discount.

Playing survival whilst flying in helicopters and blowing the ♥♥♥♥ out of dinosaurs is pretty fun, but this doesn't make up for the downsides.\n\nThe graphics in this game is meh, just meh. The lens flares can literally be blinding on some maps and the textures for the dinosaurs make them look like Jurassic Park CGI (the first one). For some reason, this game is EXTREMELY laggy. Even with my GTX 650 and 8 GB of ram, this game can only run around 30 frames per second. Not only this, but it looks made for the Wii.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are much like Left for Dead 2, except worse. You survive wave after wave of dinosaurs trying to destroy your generator (sidebar, why the heck do they go for the generator?). Then you need to go "hold points," after which you are awarded with different vehicles (ranged from jeeps with miniguns, jeeps with no point, a tank, a mech, and yes, helicopters). These vehicles have the absolute WORST driving mechanics...you control your vehicles...with your mouse. It's SOO HARD! You're constantly crashing into things which damges your vehicles quite a lot. You also are able to purchase weapons, upgrades for your weapons, and upgrade your character, which overall is not that bad of a system. Other than lacking a good variety of weapons.\n\nSo there is one last problem with this game...the dinosaur AI. Literally the flying dinosaurs (my friends and I call them poops) are the most irritating mob in this game. They randomly divebomb you and have a possiblity of picking you up and dropping you from great hights. They for some reason put dinosaurs that we all reconize (ect triceratops) as bosses that try to kill you. But wait, aren't triceratops herbivores? APPARENTLY NOT!\n\nOverall this is a good game if you get it on sale. It's hilarous to play with your friends and get a good laugh at for it's attempt at being good. DO NOT BUY IT FOR FULL PRICE, NOT WORTH IT.\n\nIf you want to watch gameplay to look for yourself, watch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tVdb28jmDk&feature=gp-n-y&google_comment_id=z12yyjnhior4zplag04cihobbxe2zzaygqo0k","July 13, 2014","false","2.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Said flaws include average gameplay, bad dinosaur AI, terrible animations, poor sounding, poorly excecuted ingame features and the list goes on. Its like primal carnage or Dino D-day just more terrible and with crack down skin over it just with all the good elements ripped out. Overall its a bad game, but it isn't terrible as its fun at some points as its a basic shooter and can be thrilling when you are taking on the big dinosaurs like Spinosaurus, Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus and Deinosuchus to name all the boss dinosaurs. For the causal gamer this is an ok pick up. For £1 its a steal so I would suggest picking it up when its on discount.

Then grab your high powered bow cause its killing time.\n\nA simple arcane like defense came where you gain credits after every round to buy new skills and perks along with weapons depending on your class (and some neutral ones that everyone can buy) to help you survive the increasing hordes of small an large dinosaurs.\n\nFeaturing a couple game types, you defend a generator from waves of enemies with vehicles and weapons. They perks allow certain feats to be obtained, like jumping high, being able to heal machines (as a medic) and many many more.\n\nSeveral different types of dinosaurs are present in this game, like pterodactyls, raptors, t-rex and spinosaurus. Depending on the round and which objective is present, certain dinos will spawn. These large giants are considered the bosses of the game, having very high health pools and insanely high damage.\n\nWhile the game isn't hard to master, and very easy to understand, I found it got boring playing by yourself or with random people online. I would recommend playing with a friend or two if you can.\n\nIts really cheap when its not on sale and a steal when it is.

Gotta get that out there first.\n\nIf you are looking for a mature, story driven game with deep tactical combat, intelligent AI, and characters of any sort, you will be sorely dissapointed.\n\nThis game is stupid fun, comically bad AI, silly unrealistic physics, oversimplified PVP, and less in depth than several of the games you might be used to.  It tries to do many things at once (it has PVP, PVE, open world, not open world, leveling systems, vehicle combat, augments like jetpacks and invisibility), and only does them all about half as well as it could.\n\nThat said... The game is fully aware of what kind of game it is, and the developers know exactly what you wanted out of this kind of game, and boy do they deliver. The pvp is mostly laughable, but when you have been playing co-op with a group of friends it is perfect to switch to and just start murdering each other for a change. The game will make you laugh as you discover its secrets (you can surf dinosaurs and helicopters, and there are achievements for that too).\n\nThe game is best when played with friends, but you do not have to bring any. I got the game alone and played random games without friends, but easily found a regular group of people to play with. People are helpful if you ask for help, and people WANT to be your friend. Be a little social in games and you will be rewarded. There are plenty of people that play this game, it has only gotten more popular with time, so you will never be in a situation where you cannot find an open game (or at least I have yet to ever be in that situation).\n\nFinally, the developers are active. They introduce new things all the time (like the open world Conquest mode) and apparently are going to upgrade everyone's game for free very soon (just like they did with their previous game). This game is easily worth the $15 price tag in my opinion, but goes on sale for less than a dollar all the time so you can just wait for when that happens.\n\nSo all in all, 9/10 for the kind of game that it is and tries to be. Buy this game if you ever enjoy playing games for fun. You are sure to find many new friends in the game as you madly laugh like a wildman when you create a firey tornado of death with your flamethrower as you ride the back of a T-rex and hundreds of raptors flee before you in sheer terror.","June 20, 2014","true","116.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

You dont expect a whole lot for that 99 cents, that being said this game has a lot to it.  It has been around for a while as Dino Horde, but they finally got out the Prelude update and it was a free update and now its 99 cents.  If you dont wanna play online there are bots now so you can play by yourself.  This game has character loadouts so you can change them around, and it has tons of modes.  You have human modes like survival and conquest which are fun and now you have deathmatches and stuff like that to play as humans.  Then there are modes that let you play as dinos, and guess what its all for 99 cents.  This game has been supported for years with free content, updates and support throughout most games dont get that kind of support.  Also they have workshop coming to so there is another reason.  Plus how many games can you get where you kill dinos?  This game is well worth the price, dont listen to all the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing because really its only 99 cents, its not like its expensive, also it has cards too I believe so there's also that.

For literally 99 cents, you really shouldn't be expecting something along the lines of an actual good game. But for some reason, despite me not playing it much (only 4 hours clocked at the time of writing this), I've had some actual fun with it. There's some bugs and graphical problems. Not to mention that on the topic of graphics, the graphics are just mediocre. The variety of weapons is pretty standard along with the option to pick up insane Adrenaline weapons.\n\nEssentially this game can be described as something similar to Killing Floor on a budget. The concept of surviving incoming waves of enemies is standard, but ORION takes some liberties in the form of objectives that need securing, the occasional mini boss dinosaur in the form of a triceretops/stegosaurs/T-Rex. There's also the option to select perks while in game to boost your chances of survival.\n\nIn all honesty the gameplay is pretty much the same as a lot of FPS's. You get a selection of three classes which all serve basic, generic roles. Assault are front line gunners and carry larger weapons. The medic is just that, a battle medic with the ability to heal teammates. Finally there's the Recon, the obligatory stealth class. The only slightly unique thing about the classes is that the Assault gets a jetpack that only serves limited use.\n\nAll in all if you're looking for a cheap game that you can fart around with your friends in, this is a good game to pick up. Just don't expect anything grand and don't expect to play this game much except for the off night you and your pals are bored out of your skulls.","August 25, 2014","true","4.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/104900/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nORION: Prelude (Formerly known as ORION: Dino Horde) is a first person shooter, with 3 different classes you can play as; Medic, Assault, or Recon. The game was a nice change of pace from standard FPS games, the game play was a bit more interesting and dynamic, I really enjoyed playing this game.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: I’m not sure if there is a story, I could see this game being inspired by the movie “Jurassic Park”. However there are very little overlapping themes. You can choose to play several different types of games, although there is no campaign at this point, I would love to play one.\n\nGame Play: When I first started playing ORION: Prelude, I noticed how my graphics card didn’t really enjoy it all that much. Although I don’t notice my graphics card struggling anymore (either because some bug was fixed, or I simply don’t notice anymore) the game play is pretty straight forward, as far as first person shooters go.\nYou see Dinosaur, you shoot them into extinction. End of story. However, the multitude of different methods with which you may choose to slaughter our scaly-friends really deserves mentioning. You can choose from sniper rifles, flamethrowers, laser rifles, automatic rifles, cryoblades, cryoknifes, oh my! That coupled with being able to go into stealth, heal yourself/friends, or use a jetpack makes for a very enjoyable dynamic game experience.\nI feel that it’s important to note: if you do not like the FPS genre this game is probably still a skip for you. Because it’s still very much a FPS, just a bit more refreshing with more options and interesting challenges.\n\nAchievements: I don’t have much to say about the Achievements at this time, because I’m still working on getting more of them. Many of the achievements are very grindy, and the others will require a friend or two to complete. I don’t really think that highly of grinding achievements, but it kept me playing. If you’re achievement driven I’d suggest caution if considering to play this game.\nOn a side note, many of the names of the achievements have really amused me; there are many references, my all time favorite being “guy on the toilet”. Just look it up, and look up the requirement. It’s pretty hilarious.\n\nPrice: ORION: Prelude’s standard price is $14.99, once again I come to my same problem and values. I think this game is really great when you play with friends, if you’re on your own; it’s not even close to being worth the buy. If you really want to try it out. The game occasionally goes on for free on the weekends. That’s an okay time to check it out to see if you like it. If you do, I recommend waiting for a sale on the game, there was a 90% sale once, that’s when my brother brought this game for me.\n\nConclusion: Pro’s:  I enjoyed playing this game, I thought it was decent for a FPS it has some quirks to work out, the game is fun to play with other people, there are a lot of guns, it let me pew pew with a bow, I’ve murdered thousands of dinosaurs (I had dreams of being eaten by a T-Rex as a child).\nCon’s: The price seems high, but the value in my eyes is close to fair… but only if you really like FPS’s or have friends to play with already. The graphics are intense on computers, the achievements are grindy, there’s no story.\nOnce again, I really did enjoy playing this game. And I’ll look forward to finishing out my 1,000 dinosaurs killed with ____ weapon achievements, but it’s not really for everyone. Good luck, and dodge when you reload!\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update May 25, 2015:\nChanged the name from "ORION: Dino Horde" to "ORION: Prelude".","May 5, 2014","true","111.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slizix/recommended/104900/","slizix","Fisherton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slizix/","285 products in account","Oh what a mess. Looking through this game's history is quite the nightmare, and makes me glad I have nothing to do with Spiral's PR team (if one even exists). I think the most important thing for anyone looking at this game to note is that it is not at all what it used to be. Over the past couple of years this game has been nurtured and cared for with an obvious love and dedication that I don't often see these days from developers. While the original ORION: Dino Beatdown was a buggy mess, Dino Horde has grown out of that messy goo into something I think plenty of people will enjoy for hours on end.\n\nI recently acquired this game while it was on sale for ~$1.00 thinking I would have a good time playing it with my friends, not expecting a whole lot based on steam reviews and such. My goodness was I pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe first thing that grabbed my attention when I loaded up the game was the depth of the options menu. The sheer amount of UI customization and graphical tweaking available is phenomenal. And they scored major points for allowing me to turn off bloom and motion blur. However I will note that I have not yet found a way to change the controller look sensitivity, which is quite the downside if you prefer to play this with a controller, and stands in stark contrast to the quality of the rest of the options menu.\n\nAfter tweaking controls and graphics options to my heart’s content, my friend and I jumped into a game of survival. Honestly, this is where I think the game suffers the most. We had absolutely no idea what we were doing, and there is very little help to be found online in the forms of wikis or guides. What we did know, was to follow the on screen prompts to turn on our generator. After we managed that, enough help popped up to lead us back to our base to buy weapons and augments (purchasable buffs that last until you die). With the starting money we grabbed a few SMGs and headed outside to kill us some dinos. Once they finally spawned we started frantically murderizing every giant reptile in sight, and they in turn began chewing on our faces. Seems dinosaurs don't appreciate bullets being hurled at them. We quickly discovered that setting the difficulty to medium for your first go might not be the best idea, and we were promptly turned into dino-chow. So we went back to the lobby, turned the difficulty down to easy and tried again. This time we were able to hold our own against the horde of angry reptiles bent on human consumption. Well, at least until wave 7.\n\nAfter we finished playing a few games of survival I found that I craved more, and dino horde was happy to oblige, allowing for an "open world" mode they dubbed conquest. In this game mode you can choose from one of two huge maps to play on. One in the arctic and one in the recently added plains. When you load this mode up you are presented with a vehicle or two for traversing the world, and a couple generators you can head towards. When you go to one of the generators and turn it on, you begin a very similar wave driven experience as survival mode, however, if you manage to last the ten waves and secure that outpost, you are rewarded with a load of cash, and the opportunity to go work on securing another outpost. I will admit that I do not know what happens if you secure more than one outpost (I saw three, but didn't have the time to play 30+ rounds).\n\nThe biggest thing that stands out to me about this game is the fact that the more I play it, the more I discover about it and enjoy it. I have only played two of the twelve (yes, twelve) game modes and already I feel that this game is worth the money they are asking for it. Admittedly it has its share of issues such as no FoV slider, a lack of pertinent help documentation (took us forever to find out how to get more ammo) and a slightly overwhelming number of game modes that have no description. However, even with these things in mind, nothing beats the thrill of fighting a horde of raptors, a t-rex, a stegosaurus, two triceratops, and a deinosuchus all at once in the middle of a rainy night while trying to capture an outpost. I felt like a kid again, and there are so few games these days that give me that thrill and excitement. Definitely give this game a try.","March 5, 2014","true","44.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/furrjacker/recommended/104900/","furrjacker","Furr Jacker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/furrjacker/","262 products in account","This has got to be one of the most boring and most disjointed games I have never had the pleasure to play.\n\nThis game has recently had a name change, for the second time, because for some reason these developers change the ♥♥♥♥ing name of their game whenever they release a "big update". This game was and still is a buggy pile of ♥♥♥♥ since launch and despite these "big updates" the bugs remain. First time they changed the name, they didn't fix anything... They just added a microtransaction store. Because they changed the name it caused a lot of bugs with Steam and it brought the game back on the front page of the Steam store and it did NOT deserve it. And now they did the same ♥♥♥♥ but it didn't seem to break the Steam Store like last time; No, all this update added was some hats, controller support (which by the way made it so that it only shows the Xbox controller buttons in the main menu, well done guys), and some game modes. I didn't even bother to play any of the other game modes after seeing how godawful their MAIN gamemode is.\n\nSo what actually is Orion Dino Beatdown/Horde/Prelude you ask? Well, it's a horde mode game involving dinosaurs. A fairly simple concept: there are waves, there are enemies, you kill enemies, progress through the waves and so it goes on. But the presentation and gameplay are so horrible that it doesn't work right (which is probably why they added the other game modes to make up for the garbage that they have created).\n\nPresentation: This game looks hideous, even for an Unreal Engine 3 game, and it runs terribly dispite how bad it looks. I had to lower all the settings down to get a decent framerate and the game definitely does not look good enough to justify it. And it appears that they added a disgusting cell shaded look that just seems completely out of place recently, weird black outlines on some places. Besides graphics, the animations are atrocious and the modeling on the guns look pathetic, the sound design is just bad, many of the guns feel weak as a result of having poor animations and sound quality. ♥♥♥♥ing magnums should not sound like BB guns. The dinosaurs look alright, decent enough modeling and sound design... Until they attack you with their adorable little nibbling animations, making them look completely unthreatening. Yeah, this game doesn't look good at all.\n\nBut ok, graphics aren't important, gameplay is what matters in a game, right? Of course, only one problem, THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE! The gameplay is so bland and generic, it has nothing original about it, it only takes game mechanics from other games, and the mechanics that it takes it doesn't do as well as where they were originally taken from. I mentioned before how the guns feel weak, and they really do. Nothing has any of the OOMPH you would otherwise see in  a competent FPS. This game's gunplay is almost as bad as Borderlands', and the guns themselves are completely uninteresting. There's very little variety in the enemies and it gets boring to fight the same dinosaurs REALLY FAST. So the gameplay is also a failure here.\n\nSo it looks bad, sounds bad and plays bad. Is there any point in getting this game? Absolutely not. It's not even so bad that it's funny, it's just awful, it isn't even worth the $1. If you want to play a good horde mode game, I highly suggest Killing Floor, it does everything right where Orion does wrong. I decided to write this review now because it seems like the developers are trying to squeeze out every little bit that they can from this game and it's just depressing to see. It feels like they really tried their best here but this just doesn't work. Guys, this game is not good, you have to move on, from here you have two choices: You either realise that game development isn't your thing, or you improve upon what you did here and take note of your mistakes. Either way, let go of this game and focus on stuff you really want to do, rather than just change the game's name multiple times and milk the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of it.","August 31, 2014","false","9.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

This game was and still is a buggy pile of ♥♥♥♥ since launch and despite these "big updates" the bugs remain. First time they changed the name, they didn't fix anything... They just added a microtransaction store. Because they changed the name it caused a lot of bugs with Steam and it brought the game back on the front page of the Steam store and it did NOT deserve it. And now they did the same ♥♥♥♥ but it didn't seem to break the Steam Store like last time; No, all this update added was some hats, controller support (which by the way made it so that it only shows the Xbox controller buttons in the main menu, well done guys), and some game modes. I didn't even bother to play any of the other game modes after seeing how godawful their MAIN gamemode is.\n\nSo what actually is Orion Dino Beatdown/Horde/Prelude you ask? Well, it's a horde mode game involving dinosaurs. A fairly simple concept: there are waves, there are enemies, you kill enemies, progress through the waves and so it goes on. But the presentation and gameplay are so horrible that it doesn't work right (which is probably why they added the other game modes to make up for the garbage that they have created).\n\nPresentation: This game looks hideous, even for an Unreal Engine 3 game, and it runs terribly dispite how bad it looks. I had to lower all the settings down to get a decent framerate and the game definitely does not look good enough to justify it. And it appears that they added a disgusting cell shaded look that just seems completely out of place recently, weird black outlines on some places. Besides graphics, the animations are atrocious and the modeling on the guns look pathetic, the sound design is just bad, many of the guns feel weak as a result of having poor animations and sound quality. ♥♥♥♥ing magnums should not sound like BB guns. The dinosaurs look alright, decent enough modeling and sound design... Until they attack you with their adorable little nibbling animations, making them look completely unthreatening. Yeah, this game doesn't look good at all.\n\nBut ok, graphics aren't important, gameplay is what matters in a game, right? Of course, only one problem, THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE! The gameplay is so bland and generic, it has nothing original about it, it only takes game mechanics from other games, and the mechanics that it takes it doesn't do as well as where they were originally taken from. I mentioned before how the guns feel weak, and they really do. Nothing has any of the OOMPH you would otherwise see in  a competent FPS. This game's gunplay is almost as bad as Borderlands', and the guns themselves are completely uninteresting. There's very little variety in the enemies and it gets boring to fight the same dinosaurs REALLY FAST. So the gameplay is also a failure here.\n\nSo it looks bad, sounds bad and plays bad. Is there any point in getting this game? Absolutely not. It's not even so bad that it's funny, it's just awful, it isn't even worth the $1. If you want to play a good horde mode game, I highly suggest Killing Floor, it does everything right where Orion does wrong.

There is little to no optimization of code, making what should be an easy to run game utterly unusable for anything but fast computers, and the threading priorities within the client are so poorly done that I even encountered audio stuttering in the menus before the game.

The game sure has its flaws but for an indie game such is expected, nevertheles a few cons don't rule out the awesomeness like badass close combat action you get to have with super sexy mother♥♥♥♥ing reptiles. 6/5, would bang (the dinosaurs I mean).\n\nOkay so Prelude is out and the game is even more awesome than before. They fixed almost all of the FPS drops which is really cool and the only problem I now have (randomly exploding sounds) is because of my sound card so nothing to complain about anymore. Totally worth the money, you definitely should support the makers so we would have more games like this. If you like dinosaurs, you will love the game. It sure can be kinda confusing at the beginning but once you get a hang of it, it is the most fun you have had in a long time, especially when playing with friends.\n\nTl;dr: You haven't even lived if you don't own the game already.","June 28, 2014","true","15.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

In the case of ORION: Dino Horde, there is a lot not to love. I was excited at the concept of the game, as I love horde-type games (MVM in TF2, Escalation in Transformers, etc.) where you are forced to work as a team to defeat unbeatable odds.\n\nIn my first time booting up Orion, I had a bit of trouble finding a server as there were not many to choose from. There are a few dedicated servers, however most are player-run on their own machines. Because of this, the lag was almost unbearable to play a decent match. There was no teamwork to be had, and usually I would blame this on the team I played with, but there wasn't any incentive to work together. I trudged on, hoping it would get better after a couple of waves. I was wrong. Server after server the dinosaurs would warp around the map, and give Michael J Fox a complex because they were so jittery.\n\nThe game feels like a Halo copy, with dinosaurs thrown in. After jumping in a jeep and manning the turret, it felt oddly familiar. This only confirmed my suspicion when I saw the tank go by. Yep, same tank, different color.\n\nIt isn't absolutely terrible, but when it was on sale for $0.99 I still didn't buy it.

Not worth the .99 nor the time to install a free trial.\n\nThe game has horrible matchmaking connectivity, match sizes are too small, and invites from friends don't work reliably.  The lobby menus are bloated with an obvious cash grab shop and "look at me" achievements.  After finally getting into the game the environments are so empty.  Sad textures on bland geometry.  The objectives are agonizingly simple, go here, push button, await dinosaurs.\nThe AI has simple charge maneuvers with little variance.  Other game modes offer different playstyles, but those are just as droll.  Playing as a dinosaur should be an exciting encounter with you as a 'boss' monster, instead you get mown down in seconds by standard weaponry and vehicles.  The bigger dinosaurs available are sluggish and their hit detection leaves you wondering if you're playing on the same map.  How did the developers attempt to balance smaller dinosaurs against their totally-not-spartan soldiers?  They've strapped 'dino-mite' (oh god this is probably what they called it) onto the back of Compy and Pterodactyls.  Orion: Dino Horde is supposed to be a dinosaur game, or at least about dinosaurs, but there are only two decent selections in the multiplayer.  It is more rewarding to be a faceless marine than the game's namesake.  I would call that a failure.\nSpeaking of "original" protagonists.  Models, animations, and even the physics feel so similar to Halo titles it is like the budget was spent paying Bungie's royalties, as if they could afford them.  The guns are such obvious plagiarisms they appear to have been stripped from Halo 2 and altered in the simplest ways.  Round a barrel here, recolor there, different gun!  The worst example is the tank.  It is the Scorpion from Halo shamelessly reused.\nOrion: Dino Horde is a decent concept, horribly executed.  The developer must be trying some last ditch effort to squeeze money out of the dying player-base.  I've found out there is another game in the works, an open world dino warfare game.  I can only hope that they've learned from their mistakes and attempt to make something different from Dino Horde.\n\nDespite all that I've said I did play this game, I did laugh at it with friends, but I still feel shorted. I spent .99 on this game and I wish I could have it back.  It is that bad.\n\nTL:DR = One of the worst things you could play.","February 26, 2014","false","2.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

The developers definitely have many ambitious goals set for Dino Horde but seem to lack the skill and/or funding to implement them properly. The animation quality is fairly poor and the game is still extremely buggy with texture detail fading in and out constantly, frame rates dropping (even on high end graphics cards) for no apparent reason, in-game audio buging out on occasions and with hitboxes that are just seemingly broken. I would be able to forgive a good many of these short comings if the game was an Early Access title however, seeing as this is a full release and updates have yet to fix these major issues, that’s sadly not the case. Overall the gameplay just feels clunky and underdeveloped with a lack of attention to detail as well as level design leaving much to be desired. I wanted to like this game but unfortunately, in short, I just can’t see myself recommending it in its current state.\n\nRawwr!!\n4/10\n\nPrelude update - About two days after I posted this review Orion Dino Horde was updated and changed names. I have yet to try Orion since it's update and second name change to Prelude (mainly cause I have no dersire) so I can't say much about the "improvements", however one thing I do approve of is the new $0.99 price tag. Still... Last time I played Orion it needed a lot of improvment for me to have given it my recommendation so I'd still be warry if you're considering purchasing this title.","August 19, 2014","false","1.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Someone who has barely any time put into this title wouldn't know anything. But, after shortly playing this game and watching gameplay, I can fully recommend this game. Though the graphics may not be technically 'there', the concept is. If you love to just kick back, relax, and kill, then this is your kind of game. Just ignore the Metacritic rating. In my opinion, it should be at least an 80. There is an amazing weapon selection to choose from along with great objectives and sudden horde bosses. It kind of has a MW3 Survival feel to it which is great.

So it was gambling if i would find a server with acceptable ping.\n\nI couldn't join any game if i tried joining a password protected game until i completely restarted the game.\n\nThere were some crashes, sending me directly back to the desktop, really annoing if we had a survival nearly finished and no idea how to find the server that i was playing on.\n\nIn game it felt a little odd sometimes, the weapon handling seemed a little off and the physique of the dinos made for some hilarious sights from time to time. Also the penalty for dieing in the survival mode seems a little harsh. If you die you not only loos all your items, they can be picked up where you died, you loose all your perks and improvements. This penalises dieing in medium or higher difficulties so hard that you might not be able to win the later waves after getting eaten in one round.\nThe only way you can influence the fight after a late death is driving vehicles.\nI know avoiding death is possible and the meaning of this game mode but somtimes there will be a T-Rex just eating you anyway.\n\nI can imagine this game being fun for a short while, if you have friends to play it with even if it crashes from time to time.\nBut playing with randoms in the matchmaking system and then loosing the connection/game crashing mid game can be really dissapointing.\n\nWell if i hadn't had those crashes and a really hard time with the server browser i would have recommended this game.\nEven if it feels a little off from time to time you can still have some nice coop fun with it.\nWell they advertised in the trailer that they improved everything and made this a great game, after watching Totalbiscuits review of the first relaunch i can see that they actually improved the interface and animations a lot but the new advertising seems to promise too much.\n\n\n\n\n","February 26, 2014","false","7.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","1"

The player spawns next to the ability upgrade teriminals, why aren't the gun terminals next to that?\n\nThe animations are so janky. The most common example is when a player is "downed". The player gets on their hands and knees and sort of hip fires their pistol at dinosaurs, but stands up on both knees to reload, dropping back down to their toddler crawl to fire some more. Aerial enemies move in little "increments" when on flight paths in this sort of jerky manner.\n\nWhy does my health not regen when I'm in a vehicle? Why does the AI sometimes get hung up on players on rocks, and other times, they just vault right up? Why isn't there a prompt for raising an ally from the ground?\n\nIt all just seems really basic and unpolished. I'm not really enamored with dinosaurs so I have to go by gameplay merits alone, and there just aren't any. A lot of other games do similar ideas better in a more cohesive manner. The scary part is I've never played this game when it was "Dino Beatdown" or whatever, and it's apparently improved a ton since then.\n\nSkip this one. Play one of the other various games in this genre instead.","June 23, 2014","false","0.8"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","1"

I open the game try out the solo and I notice how the dinossaurs movements looks like a plank with robotic legs. I still had some faith and tried joining a multiplayer game but all the servers I could find were either on the other end of the world with over 420 ping or were password protected. I mean, holly mother of dino jesus, even the T-Rex's struggle to move between wee litle dinossaurs.\nOh look, it also has hats, taunts and mutch more fun looking things, surely they are earned by skill. Nope just by money.\n\nSo remember kids, just because the trailer and pictures look fun it doesn't mean that is fun.","June 20, 2014","false","1.9"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"
