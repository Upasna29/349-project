"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeonAbomination/recommended/353280/","NeonAbomination","NeonAbomination","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeonAbomination/","1116 products in account","Ahhh VectorPark. These guys really do have a way with animation. Whatever sort of engine they are using for their work, and whatever sort of methods they use, it cannot be denied that anything that comes out of them looks as though it is filled with life and joy. Having only one game previously on steam called "Windosill", a short, simple puzzle game about going from room to room as a little car, and solving the puzzles in the room, all while watching and interacting with the environment, VectorPark decided to try their luck again with this "game", Metamorphabet. So, does it hold up?\n\nWell... yes and no. I'll say it like this. If you're expecting anything that gives you any sort of challenge, look away. If you want something with replayability, this aint it. If you want something that can at the very least keep you occupied for more than an hour... I'm sorry, but this just isn't what you are looking for.\n\nMetamorphabet is exactly what it advetises itself as. An interactive alphabet. It really is that simple. Letters appear on the screen, you click the letters, and stuff happens. Stuff that you can interact with further. For example, you could click the letter "S", and 2 striped socks that cover both sides of the letter itself. What happens if you click on the S again? The S becomes a snake, which you can now move around, and after a few seconds, the snake gets a shadow, which mirrors it's movement. S, sock, snake, shadow, you can see the pattern. It's like this with every letter. I'll try not to spoil much more, because that really is all the game has going for it for anyone who already knows the alphabet. Every letter has maybe 5 or so ways that you can interact with it. Some of these ways include dragging things, using vacuum cleaner, unzipping things, all fairly simple things, but there's a fair bit of variety with each new letter. There's usually stuff you can play with on the screen that doesn't actually affect the game, which is fun, if limited.\n\nAs for sound and visuals, the sound is nothing special. Things sound as you would expect them too. A drum sounds like a drum, a door opening sounds like a door opening. There's hardly any music, which I believe is a good thing, since the game does have sort of a relaxing atmosphere. As for visuals, it's VectorPark. If you expect anything other than beauty, then I don't know what to tell you. Everything reacts to what you do with fluid movement, and it all looks gorgeous.\n\nSo, if the game offers no challenge, and you can finsh it in under 20 minutes, is there any reason to spend money on it? Well, if you have a child just learning the alphabet, I suppose this can be a useful tool, though I feel like children who can't speak the alphabet wouldn't really know how to use a computer. I could be wrong, as the controls are really simple, but even if they could use the mouse, it's not guaranteed that they wouldn't just be distracted by all the stuff happening, instead of learning anything. The game is entertaining for what it is. With every letter comes a new surprise. Sure, the surprise only lasts a few seconds before you get bored with what's in front of you, but it's neat nontheless.\n\nCan I recommend this game? Well, check out the trailer. It gives you all the info you want. I personally don't really see why this company, who have proved the can make good games that challange players, decided to make an interactive alphabet (probably just for fun, which I can respect), but for what it is, it's good. It's pretty, it's entertaining, and it's resonably cheap, though for $5 there's not really much value for your money. I personally enjoyed windosill a lot, and love anything that comes out of these guys, so I hope they keep making games/animations. I just hope that in the future, they make actual "games" that challenge players in some way.\n\nThe game doesn't lie about what it is. It's an interactive alphabet, and that's it. The interactions are nice, it covers every letter in the English alphabet, and it looks beautiful. If that's enough for you, then sure, pick it up. If you're looking for a something challenging, maybe try Ninja Gaiden or something.\n\nWant to keep updated on games I recommend? I'm a curator!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/353280/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","This weekend had been fairly unpleasant. I’d come down with something awful, sneezing and coughing like crazy as I lounged around trying not to infect every inch of my home and the people who share it with me. I was all but forced by my body to do nothing but lie in bed wondering what I’d done to the universe this time, as I cycled between barely conscious and hyper alert and all the while failing entirely to distract myself from whatever was ailing me.\n\nI needed something to occupy my time and give me something to write about (which has become a rather therapeutic activity for me). Metamorphabet couldn’t have released at a better time.\n\nI imagine I’d have enjoyed it whenever I decided to play it, but being cooped up inside for days with a rabid fever, it came as an even more potent concentration of pure joy and creativity that I desperately needed. Every screen bounced to life with enthusiastic wonder, creating scenes and characters and bizarre anomalies out of letters that become increasingly esoteric yet perfectly fit within the game.\n\nAnd suddenly I was smiling and laughing, almost forgetting I was sick at all as I toyed with the shapes before me eagerly wondering what they might turn into next. I could barely talk because my nose and throat hurt so much, but if didn’t matter because I suddenly felt like I was a wide eyed toddler let loose in a dreamland where clouds turn into dogs and an elephant balances atop the Earth.\n\nIn all honesty Metamorphabet should be more disturbing than endearing. Certain letters can take shockingly weird turns, sprouting animal heads from fingertips and having disembodied legs grow feathers and fly away. I think it manages to overcome its weirdness though by how it never so much as hints at a hidden layer of cynicism or unpleasantness. Being a game focused around the alphabet it could be easy to get the impression Metamorphabet is a game for kids, but when I actually played it any doubts that I was the wrong audience immediately faded away. It doesn’t feel like a game that’s been hamstrung into something kids can play the way so many children's games do, or that had all the life sucked out of it because its creators don’t care enough to create a kid friendly game worth playing.\n\nIf anything Metamorphabet goes out of its way to never box itself into a certain demographic. It’s full of the sort of universal love and joy that I can’t imagine anyone with half a heart wouldn’t find at least a little delightful regardless of their age. It introduced me to what I imagine my baby niece sees and feels when playing with simple blocks and stuffed animals, simple toys becoming outlets to unleash her imagination in a world that probably doesn’t make a lot of sense but is full of amazing things if only you could see them like she does.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","May 2, 2015","true","0.8"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","17","17","3","0"

I honestly didn't think I would get a kick out of it like i did though. It's interactive, its colorful, which when combined together is perfect for a child. i have a daughter that just turned 5 and i know she would be interested in playing it.
