Very different from happy VNs. If you feel triggered about depression and suicide, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. Overall, I think this VN was made for a more mature audience (even if this is the teen version; yes, there's no explicit porn or very direct dialogue about sex, but still... I feel that this game still carries a "heavy meaning", maybe not that suitable for people who aren't used to this kind of story), and that’s why I enjoyed it. There’s just a little complaint tho: why all the characters sprites follow a certain art style and Yunwoo’s sprite is totally different? And to be honest, I liked the art style used on his sprite a lot better than the other ones…\n\nI liked the BGs a lot too, along with the BGM. Get this game on sale, and get ready for drama.\n\n7/10.","March 24","true","4.3"," 64 of 81 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","64","81","5","9"
