I was expecting 2D Zelda with more fluid combat, but I got was a top down Souls game.

There are no instructions, no warnings, and the game does not hold your hand - it just throws you into a trial by fire, and I constantly felt that I was just barely holding on.\n\nThe game gives you two weapons (at a time), a sword, the ability to rapidly dodge short distances, and precious few hit points, and then brings on wave after wave of enemies, all with strong AI that are not afraid to flank you or attack you en masse. Multiple enemy types with various strengths and weaknesses constantly joined forces to put me into harrowing positions that I could just barely eek may way through. Any gamer who has ever watched a game and incredulously thought, "Why are they lining up and attacking one at a time? No one would ever do that," will love this game. The challenge level is real, even in (for lack of a better description) platforming elements, where the player's blink/teleport/dodge is utilized like a real game element, and not just a "press x to not die" style safety button. But even when you do die (and you will... a lot), death is never overly penalized. In my many, many deaths playing this Beta, I never felt overwhelmed at a need to replay huge chunks of the game; the checkpoint system is invisible, which is to say executed perfectly.\n\nThe game drips atmosphere. Without anything even resembling a story being delivered, I feel like I know this world; it could also be that the team has just perfectly captured the feeling of a dystopian dream, including the earnestness of the character you're playing. I don't know what the Drifter wants, or why, but I do know that no one would go through all of this unless it was truly life or death. The pixel style artwork is phenomenal, even if the 2D/3D design sometimes tricks the eye a bit when giving the illusion of depth and height simultaneously. The music is INSANELY good. Rich, deep, mysterious, and in the style of the artwork, evokes what might have been in a masterpiece of the 8bit/16bit era.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough. My only complaint about the beta was its length. I'm dying to play more. If anyone has any questions, feel free to message me.","March 31","true","6.3"," 363 of 413 people (88%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","88","363","413","19","10"

You've lost the thrill for the challenge.\n\nThat's when you'll try New Game + mode where you replay the game with all abilities unlocked from the beginning...but your health is capped at 40% which means enemies will kill you in two regular hits or one single heavy attack. Bosses one shot as well in this mode.\n\n\nPeople often compare this game's difficulty in NG+ mode with Dark souls. It's nothing like it. It's much fairer.\n\nYou don't have to guess what enemies do. You don't have to die at least one time against each boss because their attacks are unpredictible. When an enemy is about to attack, you know what it will do and where. This game doesn't test your guess work, or your patience against die-and-retry kinds of boss. It tests your reflexes and quick decision making because yes, all attacks are easily predictible, but rarely over 0.25s in advance.\n\n\nOne last thing : to fully apreciate this game, you have to know that the guy behind its idea was born with several life-threatening heart defects. This is why despite its esoteric, borderline childish art style, the game doesn't shy away from heart/blood or even death symbolisms so keep an eye out for those.\n\n...Now that i think about it, this game is almost a life lesson.\n\nOne last (but important) thing, playing with a controller is much easier.","April 20","true","34.6"," 130 of 138 people (94%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","94","130","138","12","9"

People have been saying it's like Dark Souls, and while I can see why they would say that, I don't think that's really accurate, either.\n\nThis game is all about timing and finese. If you try to button mash through combat against anything but the most basic of enemy, you're gonna get wrecked. Likewise, you can't just spam health items to cheese the combat because using a health item during combat is probably going to have the opposite effect from what you were hoping. Healing doesn't happen instantly, and trying to heal in combat leaves you open. The enemies will take advantage and punish you.\n\nYou've got your standard sword, which is your basic melee attack. You also get a gun fairly early, and it really comes in handy on certain enemies.  There's an evade roll that you're gonna get real familiar with, and it is used for both setting up counter attacks as well as exploring and uncovering secrets.\n\nThis game has a lot of secrets, by the way. You'll want to check any walls that look odd, and keep an eye out for platforms that might be on the very edge of the screen, only showing a few pixels. It's also not uncommon for secret areas to have other secret areas inside them. It might be worth noting that some of these hidden areas are manditory for progressing through the game, so if you hate exploring you'll probably end up using a walkthrough. Like a silly little casual.\n\nAs you collect currency, mainly from all the secret areas you'll come across, you can buy various upgrades in town. There are vendors for different types of skills. One vendor sells various sword upgrades, another sells gun upgrades, and one has evade roll upgrades. There are a couple others around, too.\n\nI do have one issue with the game, and that is the fact that there is no dialogue or text at all in the story. The story is told to you via pictures. I feel like it wasn't the best choice for this game, because the story is really weird, and very hard to understand. I was lost before the intro cutscene finished. It makes it hard to get invested in the story when it's basically nonsense. Keep in mind I'm not saying this is a strike against the game, I'm saying it's something I personally didn't like.\n\nStill, this is a really fun game with neat aesthetics and intense combat.\n\nYou should probably get it.\n\nUnless you're a smelly casual.","April 2","true","21.9"," 255 of 311 people (82%) found this review helpful 88 people found this review funny","82","255","311","88","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aizawaa/recommended/257850/","Aizawaa","crowbAr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aizawaa/","341 products in account","rating: worth buying at full price\nscore: 9/10 - must play\nsimilar games: FEZ, Dark Souls, Transistor, Legend of Zelda, Megaman Zero\ntags: Beautiful, Sci-Fi, Post-Apocalypse, Exploration, Combat, Hard\n\nHyper Light Drifter is one of the top league Indie games like Transistor, Shovel Knight or Banner Saga. With 6 hours playtime it isn't that long (although you might need longer if you die more often), but in my opinion it was the perfect playtime for this game and it felt really complete and round. But there is also a next game+ mode, which I will definitly play, especially because you can't get all upgrades on your first playthrough.\nUPDATE: Next Game+ mode is a bit dissapointing. All that changes is that your Health gets limited to 2, so you die in one hit against bosses and can only take one hit from  some normal enemies. I still try to beat this mode, but it isn't what I hoped a "next game+" mode would offer.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a Top Down game where you explore a "post apocalyptic" like world and fight monsters. You also meet other characters, but there is no understandable language in this game. When NPCs talk to you you see images of what they are talking about. I think this is okay, if these characters would speak english for example, it could hurt the atmossphere. And even though you don't hear a single word, some characters are actually really cool. There is also lots of mystery involved and even after beating the game, I'm still not 100% sure what really happened. Maybe I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥, maybe the game isn't bringing across it's story well, I don't know, but I still had a very satisfying experience.\n\nExploration is one of my favorite things in video games, but I'm not talking about exploration like in Firewatch or The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, I'm talking about exploration in games like Dark Souls and Half-Life, and there is plenty of that in this game. The level design is open, but also focused and guides you. There are always side paths where you can find stuff and there are also really well hidden, but also well hinted, secrets. You also never get lost, because you have a map and every area has a unique theme. Also there are landmarks like giant corpses of some giant beings which help you orientate in the world. The world of this game is really amazing actually, and it's so beatiful.\n\nWhat really rounds up this world and the atmossphere is the music. It just perfectly fits this game and is so well made. It sounds a bit like it's inspired by FEZ actually (not only that). I also love how the music just flows, there are not sudden stops or clear moments where music starts and where it ends. All of this is so well made and helps to create this unique, beautiful and immersive world, which is just fun to run around in, but what about the combat?\n\nI love the combat. I really really love it. I love that this game makes no compromises. This game isn't extremely difficult, but it punishes beginner mistakes, like button mashing. You have to completely understand each mechanic to be able to succeed, but there are plenty of opportunties where you will learn them. Every area has it's own enemy types, each with it's own strength and weaknesses. Some hit hard and have lots of HP, but are slow, some are really fast but have really low hp, some have ranged attacks, some have multiple attack types. This means that when you are in a fight you have to priortize different enemies, just like in Doom or Serious Sam. Like in Dark Souls you have a limited amount of healing items you can carry, and using a healing item takes a little bit of time, so you have to time it right. Also you have to decide if you want to heal early or late, depending on how much you are willing to risk.\n\nWhat really made me love this game are the bossfights. ALL of them are really well made, although one boss was a bit too easy and I beat him first try (the boss of the water world, the frog thingy). Every boss starts with a small number of attack types and is not too overwhelming, but the more the fight continues, the crazier attacks they will use. Because of this there is no trial and error. You can watch the bosses do their things while you keep dodging. Also when you die and restart, you won't get overwhelmed immediately. There is much more to the gameplay I could talk about, but all that should matter for this review is that the combat is really well made, well thought out and also extremely responsiv and beginner friendly (but the game is really hard). You will need a controller though.\n\nBtw I didn't even notice the 30 fps, because of pixel art and the game is still very responsive, but 60 fps would obviously be better.","April 2","true","11.6"," 148 of 177 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","148","177","7","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EchoNine/recommended/257850/","EchoNine","Echo Nine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EchoNine/","257 products in account","DISCLAIMER\nI don't write a lot of reviews so I know my review might be bad, but I had to for Hyper Light Drifter. It probably says I have 12 hours in this game, but at the time of writing this review, 7 of those hours are from the release build and the rest from the preview build.\n\nEdit Reason: I forgot to talk about how it runs.. Sorry..\nEdit Reason 2: Reworded a few things.\n\nKick Starter:\nAs a kick starter backer, this game has given more that I expected. The preview build of the game was amazing and hyped me up for the release. And I wasn't let down at all.\n\nSo What Is It?:\nMany reviews already tell you what the game is like so, I'll keep it simple. Hyper Light Difter is a top down, action adventure, pixel art master piece. The mechanics (which involve sword play, dashing and ranged weapons) are rock solid and never fault you for unknown reasons. The atmoshpere and sound design are honestly one of the best experiences i've had in a long time, the story is super interesting and cryptic (this is a bonus or a flaw depending on how you like your stories) and lastly the game feels SO good to play.\n\nAnything Else?:\nThe game's difficulty gives me a dark souls 1 vibe, PLEASE don't misunderstand what I mean by this.\n\nWhat I mean is; the game is hard but fair, deaths that happen are your fault. Very very rarely will something kill you and leave you thinking "there is no way I could have saw that coming." Apart from experiencing a boss for the first time, which will leave you crushed into the ground after your first attempt.\n\nCool Opinions, What about the controls?:\nThe controls feel perfect on a gamepad, as I used a xbox360 type controller. Personally I find HLD is best played on a game pad but still controls well on keyboard(APART FROM DASHING, SEE FORUMS). The drifter (the character you play) moves very smoothly and is easy to control in pretty much any situation.\n\nStill Some One Sided Opinions in there, what about length?:\nWell here is where the game is slightly pulled down. SLIGHTLY. My first playthrough was about 5 hours and 30 mins. I didn't explore every single thing, although I did sit down and just look at the beautiful pixel art at times, so you could probably pull it out to 8 - 10 hours if you wanna find EVERYTHING. But if you are worried about the length, there is new game +. And trust me, this game has replay value.\n\nWhat If I Don't Care About Secrets and Stuff?:\nWell you should because there is countless secret areas in the game. And a lot of these areas you need to find to continue the story, at least I think you do... Either way just keep your eye out if you are interested in secrets. IF NOT, you could probably beat the game in like 4 hours. I'm not a speed runner so I couldn't tell you.\n\nNew Game +? (More info to come):\nYup, instead of 5 health, you have 2! Goodluck! :)\nEnemy placement seems the same but holy ♥♥♥♥ its difficult. You have to completely adapt to a new playstyle and have even quicker reactions.\n\nWhat about how the game RUNS?:\nWell its locked to 30fps. The devs said it was due to the logic in Game Maker coded to work  with 30 fps, but other people on the forum said that the devs could of easily created the game 60fps with no issues. So take that as you will. I also seem to get a fair bit of screen tear some times, but this only happens if the camera is moving constantly.\n\nBugs?:\nOnly one I've found so far. I dashed too fasted into a boss fight and my character was perma stuck in the "i'm standing still for the boss intro to look cool" phase. I couldn't move but couldn't take damage, so i just restared the game (it restarted me at the begining of the boss room) and it worked fine.\n\nSoooo Do You Recommend it?:\nFuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk yes. This game honestly blew my mind. Every sence is just too ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful. The enviromental story telling lets your mind go crazy, the combat feels too good... You can interact with NPCs by pressing Y (or your equivalent button) and they way the communicate back to you is very Journey style, where as your little robot guy pings a sound and the NPC responds with it's own sound. ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant. HIGHLY RECOMMEND with a game pad.\n\nSO LASTLY:\nIf you like games with combat that requires good reaction and a decent amount of thinking, a LOT of hidden secrets, a fun as ♥♥♥♥ dash ability, not much story hand holding (you gotta figure a lot of ♥♥♥♥ out), beautiful pixel art and lastly, engrossing atmosphere, then you should 100% get Hyper Light Difter.\n\nAnd if you don't like it, refund it? Sooo what are you worried about...","March 31","true","34.8"," 159 of 194 people (82%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","82","159","194","15","14"

Improvement comes from you and learning how to use the skills and equpment is what grants you strength. You can play through it without any optional upgrades at all, I think.\n\nYou cna also play the stages in any order but it's usually recommended to get the multi-dash upgrade first for an easier time.\n\nThere's also platforming here which is a delight for me who grew up with platformers.\n\nThe game is very atmospheric with it's gorgeous pixel visuals and animations but I do feel apathetic playing it most of the time. I can't find any emotional attachments to any of the characters because it's a silent game. Pure visual story telling would work if the story was simple but I get the feeling that it's far more complex than it seems. There's even a bit of time travel here from what I understand. This might just be my own preference because I can't stand narratives in games with silent protagonists.\n\nMy only real con about this game is that it feels kinda' short or I just found an exploit and ripped right through the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/recommended/257850/","slothyexistence","The Slothful Existentialist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/","952 products in account","Overview:Hyper Light Drifter is a 2D action-adventure RPG game inspired by and made as an homage to 8-bit and 16-bit classics from the 80s and 90s. The game consists of fast-paced, real-time strategic-combat gameplay. The game is developed and published by Heart Machine, made using GameMaker: Studio. It’s available for PC, OS X and is planned to be available for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in the future. It is a very special game.\n\n\nStory:This game’s story has to be fully inferred. There’s no dialogue, only imagery; this takes after SNES’ games’ tendencies to not have any dialogue. The Drifter (our protagonist) is ill, he coughs up blood constantly, implying his impending death. The protagonist’s illness is inspired by the game’s creator’s own battle with heart disease. Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind is a major inspiration for the game’s world. Hidden around the game is ancient technology forgotten by the world’s inhabitants, The Drifter sets out on a journey to find a cure for his illness and in his journey is revealed the secrets of this ancient technology. However, his adventure is not without obstacles. There are many enemies throughout the game, four main bosses to the North; South; East; and West; as well as some other bosses in some locations of the game.\n\nThe narrative through imagery is extremely atmospherical, which in turn conveys different emotions. There are some NPCs in the game which have certain stories to tell, most of which deal with themes such as hardship and needing help from the good-hearted protagonist. Although it’s a bit difficult to understand the story in its entirety, the game manages to leave you feeling like you’ve just been through quite the adventure by the time you finish it.\n\n\nGameplay:The gameplay is extremely fun, it is also challenging. The Drifter uses an energy sword for melee attacks, ranged weapons like guns, and AoE attacks. The enemies in the game become more abundant and progressively harder to defeat, forcing the player to experiment with different tactics. The game’s creator, Alex Preston, says the game is a combination between TLOZ: A Link to the Past and Diablo. You can save and restore health at certain checkpoints in the game, which also serve as fast-travel points. These points can be found in the central city, and in the four areas surrounding the city. The player can upgrade certain aspects of the Drifter’s ability by finding batteries, which function like money/ability points. The developers also recently added a local co-op mode which is in BETA. Each boss has a very particular pattern, and have varying levels of difficulty, the last of which is the hardest. Even if this game takes after titles such as Dark Souls, it is not as hard, though gamers who enjoy a challenge will definitely enjoy this one. It’s simple but testing, can be casual at times, but unforgiving if you’re careless.\n\n\nVisual:Two words: Pixel Art. This game has a very attractive aesthetic, all rendered in beautiful pixel art. The animations are wonderful and the environmental design is a delight to look at. Even though it is clearly a 2D game, some of the animations are executed so well that it almost seems like it might be 3D at times. From the visual effects to the simple animations of doors opening, swords swinging, and things exploding. It’s all fluid and satisfying to see. Although the cover art and concept art for the game is relatively minimalistic, in-game everything is fairly detailed, considering it’s all pixel art. The character feels alive and never feels odd to move or strike with. The atmosphere and ambience that the game’s visuals manifest is enough to immerse you into playing it for hours on end.\n\n\nSound:Sound in this game is what makes it all work. Combat sounds, environmental sounds, and character speech sounds, they’re all great, but the sound that makes it all come together is the music. It’s not very surprising that the soundtrack is so good, since the composer is Disasterpeace, the same guy who made the soundtrack for Fez. The 16-bit style music is a nostalgic trip to the SNES and is what completes the immersive experience of playing the game. The image-based narrative goes side by side with the soundtrack, making all extremely cohesive.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:To be entirely honest, I didn’t expect much about this game except that it had Dark Souls-esque gameplay and a nostalgic aesthetic... until I started playing it. When I did, it quickly took me back to my childhood experiences of playing games like The Legend of Zelda, I must have put in close to four hours in my first session, I simply could not put the controller down. The story drew me in, the gameplay satisfied and challenged me, and I’ve enjoyed every minute. When I finished it I was surprised to see the credits go on for so long, Heart Machine aside, this was a fairly big production for an indie game. The special thanks section has some interesting names in it. I can’t help but have full respect for Heart Machine in reaching out to different people, funding their game with kickstarter, and delivering a truly special product. This game is very special.","May 2","true","15.2"," 49 of 49 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","49","49","0","5"

This game is great. Yes, it may be a bit hard for some people but that's what makes it fun.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a shining example of what a great game is and what an "Indie" game can be. Stirpped down graphics can still be beautiful, no cutscenes and dialogue force the use of imagination (God forbid), both for player and desginer, in both telling the story and weaving it into gameplay, and the ambient music is both mysterious and foreboding; setting an atmosphere that makes the game's world feel all the more vast and unknown.\n\nOne of the best games this year, I'm calling it. One of the best gaming experiences I've had since Shovel Knight. There's no going wrong in picking up this title.

Fighting bosses will feel like a read duel, where every hard hit will count for both sides with devastating effects; bravery and skill are well rewarded,despite the weird controls, meaning that if you don't need to "git gud" at the game, you can atually wreck even the advanced bosses with few well placed hits/shots.\n4- collecting secrets and currencies needed to upgrade your equipment never feels boring as the hidden areas, even if well hidden sometimes, are fun to be explored and admired when finally discovered and reached\n5- the map is really,really big, full of remarkable (secret) locations, landscapes,dungeons and a main village with houses and available shops as well\n6- the game is challenging and extremely hard at times, giving high satisfaction when the player is finally able to grasp and then master all the combat and movement mechanics\n7- Movement and combat upgrades are creative,satisfying and beautiful, despite the horrendous framerate\n\nBAD ONES:\n1- HL Drifter is plagued by an unstable 30 fps lock, meaning that during intense boss fights or hard arena-like rooms your framerate will drop to 10-12 fps, causing you to take damage or even worse,dying and repeating the whole level/dungeon section even when it's not your own fault. This problem becomes extremely important on New Game + mode, where you basically die with one single hit; the game itself is really hard and in New Game + HLD becomes the bad clone of Titan Souls, but with a halved framerate and with shoddy controls.\nExample: one of the most important weapons in the game will take effect only 2-3 seconds after you've pushed its command button. Imagine playing CSGO with a 2 seconds input delay. Have fun losing.\n2- The game map is nonsensical and useless. I'll quote Dr.Manhattan from Watchmen here: "I would only agree that a symbolic clock is as nourishing to the intellect as a photo of oxygen to a drowning man."\nHow can i describe this map? Imagine to get lost in a cave below a city, now you'll have to find your way back home by using the metropolitan city map. Unless you have good memory, you might get lost and confused.\n3- HLD uses almost the same narrative system adopted by Teslagrad, meaning that the story is showed by small cutscenes and obscure, wordless comic balloons. HLD...fails miserably in mimicking Teslagrad; the real story and the rhunes' alphabet were deciphered by a clever and passionated Steam user and the lore was explained by some cool Reddit's posts. The game itself doesn't do NOTHING to be clear or less cryptic! Even collecting and reading all the  monument stones  will not reveal ANYTHING to you,at all!\n4- Weapons' upgrades are extremely superficial, allowing you to improve only their magazine size. Some weapons are useless and obsolete from the exact moment you've picked them, making the game and combats less varied. They suffer the same fate of the PP-Bizon in CSGO competitive matches, meaning that that weapon is useful in few situations and only in a precise part of the match, making it pointless for the following matches.\n\nTO SUM UP:\nHyper Light Drifter is a gorgeous looking 2D game, plagued by a poor narration, sometimes wacky controls and awful framerate locked at 30 fps, often unstable. If you're going to buy it remember that playing it without collecting any item or completing any secret area will give you for 20$ a 5-hour long videogame.","May 22","true","35.4"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","36","40","2","2"

You die to a boss and you respawn immediately before the fight able to try again within moments. Bed of Chaos from Dark Souls 1 made you walk one minute across a pool of lava before you could re-fight him.\n\nI had to take a pause in the game to soak in the beautifully crafted environments. This game didn't need to look so damn good but it decided to look ultra F-I-N-E anway.The colors pop vibrantly like the neon 80's. Music is a little bland and forgettable though.\n\nThe game doesn't do any handholding so here are some important tips that will save you some trouble.\n\n1) The levels are all about the same difficulty. You can do them in any order.\n2) Tackle the East first, that boss is the easiest and your reward is a very high dps weapon\n3) Purchase the triple dash before you head North. You'll want it for both the level and the boss.\n4) The boss in the west is the hardest by far\n5) The dash attack item is useless--the input is only one frame long so it never comes out.","April 1","true","9.0"," 64 of 86 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","64","86","0","6"

It requires a level of mastery and reflex that isn't really like any other top-down adventure game I've played.  Makes successful combat very satisfying and makes you want more.\n\n-Lumping this in with other pixel style games is unfair.  I personally hate pixel art games.  This game is dazzling.  Beautiful art design that is more stylized; it doesn't use pixel art as a compromise for poor art-design or limited resources.  It elevates the style to a new level, and I doubt many who use the style will be able to answer.\n\n-The Legend of Zelda influence is there, and it's compelling.  The cinematic qualities aren't overbearing, but they definitely enhance the experience enough to add intrigue.\n\n$20.00 might seem like a high price, but it's more than worth it for this.

Slice, dash, shoot. You eventually get other weapons and a few new abilities, like 2 flavors of dash attacks, projectile reflection and a charge attack.   Enemies have patterns that you exploit to damage them and try not to get hurt in return. It's simple but overall fairly solid.  Bosses are extra challenging and pretty fun.  The length of the game didn't overstay its welcome, but near the end it was definitely becoming a little boring fighting normal enemies.\n\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe game looks beautiful, both in motion and in stills. The opening is probably one of the coolest openings I can remember. Each 'main' section of the game world has it's own theme both above and below ground. There's a few cool setpieces in the game for you to appreciate [A battle frozen in crystal, remains of a titan, etc] , sometimes little details too.  I wish there were more of these honestly, just cool places to explore and appreciate, to try and put the story together, as oftentimes areas within the same zone kind of just blend together.\n\nMusic:\n\nThe game's music is very low key for the most part, ambient electronica. While on paper that sounds boring, in game it's used to great effect, with special musical cues during cinematic scenes or exploring an important area.\n\n-Questionable-:\n\nThe story:\nAside from the monoliths, which are in their own language, there's no written text or dialogue in the game. That would be fine, but there's a real minimal amount of 'picture dialogue' in game. It's all very nice, I just wish there was more of it.  Most of the story is derived from conjecture. There's no real character growth, either from the player or the NPCs, even as the world changes.\n\n\n\n-The bad-:\n\nMechanics:\nI never got good at chain dashing. Maybe that's a personal thing, but it probably isn't helped by the 30fps max that a fast paced pixel art game shouldn't be running at.  You also get a shield dash, which seems to only work about 3/4's of the time.  That's probably also my fault, I think it has weird vulnerabilities on startup and end.  Weapons don't really feel balanced. The pistol is worthless compared to every other weapon (except against those 1 HP birdmen) and the homing shard launcher is also a little underwhelming. The lasergun is too situational.\n\n\nSecrets:\nThey're terrible. They're a chore. They're poorly implemented.\n\n\nThey usually come in a few varieties. Invisible hallways, some of which have the BAREST of visual cues, a few that almost have zero, and about 3 that actually have reasonable hints. The worst part about these is that they're not consistent, having you end up just wallhugging the entire game. It really brings the entire experience down.\n\nThere's also hidden platforms. These are probably the worst. In some locations if you stand on an exact player sized area, your drone will make a little ping and you can activate it to reveal some platforms that you can dash on to. These kinds of secrets are absolutely terrible.  A few of them have the absolute slightest of hints (a hole in a fence of a walled platform), but even then finding these kinds of secrets is more of a chore when it should be exhileration.\n\nThere's also a few secrets where if you dash to one platform your normally locked camera will be moved to see a new area. I found most of these by myself, but they still were unintuative.\n\nThe worst hidden area I can remember is in the southern sector of the game, where you have to make a blind dash towards off screen to get on another platform.\n\nOther:\n\nThere's also the map. It's very general, and for the most part, won't really be a help to anyone, aside from when you're looking at a guide to find where you missed secrets.  The game doesn't really have any puzzles.  I felt this to be a little wierd for a game that cited link to the past as a main influence. I wish the game had less obtuse hiding locations and more challenges for items.\n\n\nReplayability:\nThe game stayed fun all the way through, but I didn't find any joy at going through it again, even with the alternate drifter or the 2 HP NG+ mode, which I realized in advance I probably wasn't good enough for, at least not without a lot of redoing.  The game just doesn't really offer enough ways to play differently, or an exciting story to experience again\n\n\n\n\n\n-  Overall - :  Good for one playthrough for most players, only those looking for an abstract kind of suffering will replay on NG+  At it's price of 20bux, it's reasonable.\n\ntl;dr\n\nHyper Light Drifter wants to be Link to the Past:Prepare to Die Edition with super metroid exploring, but ends up being Metroid II: Indie Edition.","April 14","true","16.4"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","35","41","4","0"

Which is why it was so glorious when his health bar hit zero, and my drifter did his victory dance. Those who would complain of difficult boss fights in games, well, this game has them. You'll need to be patient.\n\nLooking back, I could have probably killed him without the extra clip for my pistol, as well as the extra health pack. But I'm glad I gained these upgrades.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is some kind of mix between the older Zelda titles, with a spattering of Dark Souls, and all the atmosphere of a game like Bastion.\n\nOnce you get to the main hub, you can explore the world in four directions, with each direction ending in a boss fight. As you explore the world, you unlock upgrading chips which can be cashed in at shops in the main town. There are a number of upgrades affecting your sword, your guns, your movement, your health packs, and grenades. I'm about 23% through the game, based on what I've collected so far, and I can say at this point that it really doesn't matter what I picked up, except for maybe multi-dash/projectile reflection. Of the two boss fights I've done, they've seemed to be the most useful skills to have. I'd wager neither are necessary.\n\nThe game is devoid of text, and there's no voice acting. Everything you discover, you do so through images that present events, and visuals that explain your purpose, etc. Talking to people consists of seeing a few images that make up their story, and in many cases, a symbol is added to your map. You're on your own to divine what everything means. Exploration of the world helps in this regard, as the atmosphere provides you context for the world you're in.\n\nBonus points for that skeleton giant on the mountainside in the north. Seeing it in the background, and then actually encountering that area proper screamed Dark Souls.\n\nEach enemy has a differing amount of life, and a different moveset. If you're impatient, you'll quickly find your Navi-like sprite shouting at you to heal. Once you've run the gamut against a few of the same type of enemies, you'll no longer find yourself in this situation, instead dispatching groups of shuriken-throwing ninjas with untenable grace. I suggest picking up the sword-projectile deflection as soon as possible, as your ability to deflect can transform a pain-staking ambush into a slaughterhouse ballet.\n\nBosses require a Dark Soulsesque amount of patience. Learning their moves, learning where you'll be safe, when you can attack using your different weapons, and again, maintaining safety, are your priorities. It can get frustrating, but I wouldn't call it twitch-style play. There's a certain amount of a grace period with regards to timing, at least as far as I've made it. You can set yourself up with quite a few potions with relative ease, allowing a greater grace for mistakes. Dying resets you to the closest checkpoint, which usually occur when you swap screens. Occasionally, you'll encouter ambush-style encounters where you can't escape until you clear the field, usually ending in a checkpoint. If you die in an area without hitting a checkpoint, all upgrades gained and enemies killed will respawn. Most enemies in an area do not respawn once dispatched.\n\nHealth packs respawn, so you can properly prepare for boss fights, as well as exploring new areas.\n\nOne of the few things I haven't yet mentioned is the ability to unlock "magenta triangles" for each of the areas you go to. I've yet to realize their significance in the context of lore. They're used to unlock specific doors in each of the 4 areas. Specifically, each area has its' own pieces, which you'll collect as you explore, allowing access for further exploration.\n\nFinally, there are a number of locked doors, labelled with a key symbol, which I've yet to unlock. Mysterious.\n\nAt this point, I'm going to stop writing and continue playing. I have the urge to see another gorgeous vista. Plus, there're some water-submerged ruins that need picking through with a fine-tooth comb.\n\nAdieu.","April 2","true","10.6"," 34 of 44 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","34","44","3","2"

It feels like an amalgam of my own past, escaping into 8-bit NES and titles like Blaster Master and Guardian Legend and Crystalis, although it's not a direct reference to any of those games... But it's like that, especially if you grew up playing 8- and 16-bit video games developed in Japan... Somehow mixed in all this is the DNA of visionary anime like Nausicaa and other fare.\n\nIt feels like a conversation held in the chiptune pixelated language of an entire era and aesthetic. Something somber about it all, too, a bit gothic perhaps.  The game invites profound awe and introspection just one layer below the action with every sprite, background, and audio track.\n\nHyper Light Drifter seems to come from the heart, and stands loudly proclaiming the artform of gaming lives on even as the world, wonder, and hope of our childhoods fade and are replaced with something more knowing, more appreciative of the fleeting good, and more weary of all in the world that erodes it.   It's especially poignant today; evocative of a cultural era that seems to be slipping through our fingers as the Japan of a generation or two ago that reached such stunning artistic heights in anime and digital media perhaps begins to fade.\n\nI'm still relatively early in the game, but would enthusiasticly recommend it to anyone who enjoys deep, quiet, beautiful exploration, tremendous atmosphere, exceptional music, and a bit of legitimately challenging twitch gameplay. :)","April 22","true","19.0"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

Often times I'll die, and go back into the encounter with a new plan and win because I'm more familiar with the challenge at hand. This is the best kind of difficulty.

You control the drifter and set out to help a town out by ridding surrounding areas from all kinds of baddies. You're armed with your sword and your trusty side-arm, you traverse the lands by using your abilities. This is Hyper Light Drifter.\n\nLet us begin. Although there's no direct dialogue in Hyper Light Drifter, there are pictures that pop up when you meet the friendly npc's you come across that give you an idea of what's happening. You pretty much have to piece the story together from these images. The same with goes for the upgrade shops, you must use pictures to know how much a new item costs and what it does.\n\nThe game features an open world which the player must explore thoroughly in order to complete the game. The world is full of life and death. It's cute and charming yet ominous. It's lively yet has some sense of emptiness and dispair to it. The levels have lower levels which is where you gain keys you will use to unlock other areas and eventually battle the boss of that area.\n\nCombat is inspired by Dark Souls, it's simple but very effective. It's all aboutthe player being able to memorize the enemies paatterns and acting accordingly. Attack, dodge, and attack again. If you've ever played a Dark Souls game or another game inspired by Dark Souls (countless games out there now) then you should know the drill.\n\nPros  Very cool pixel art-style, great use of color makes the game pop\nMysterious and lonely feeling as you explore the world around you\nTranquil soundtrack\nFull controller support\nCons  Locked at 30fps\nNo dialogue to clearly tell players what's going on\nCan't set your own resolution, game uses automatically uses your desktop resolution\nFinal Thoughts:\nThe game started off very strong for me, howerver delving deeper into the game, the world managed to stay consistent in keeping my interest from start to finish. The game was worth the wait to fully experience what the game had to offer. A great alternative to games of the same vain if you need something different.\n\nRating (8.3 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","April 4","true","2.7"," 61 of 100 people (61%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","61","61","100","9","17"

Everything about this game is great, from the music to the art style and overall gameplay. I love how it looks like a simple adventure indie game but at the same time I love how challenging and difficult it is behind all the prettiness that is this game. You cant necessarily improve your character based on just leveling up only, I like that while there are a few upgrades and perks from outfit combos, it's mostly you learning how to improve on your movements and utilizing what you've learned to defeat different enemies. At first it's confusing as you don't really know where to go. There isn't any dialogue at all besides a few figures shown to by certain characters. You choose where to start, either north south east or west and just follow the path and see where it takes you. At first I didn't like that there wasn't a guide as to where to start, but really that's what makes this game so special. It's an unknown world and you immerse yourself in it. Once you explore after a few hours you'll start to get the hang of it. The bosses are amazing, the enemies are unique too. And besides all that there are so many hidden secrets and items to collect from outfits to gear bits. You don't necessarily need to collect everything to progress in the game, but if you're like me you want to 100% it and collect everything. And if the game isn't hard enough for you as it is you can try it on NG+ mode and make your life a whole lot more complicated.\n\nMy only complaints about this game is on collecting items, it was a pain to collect all 186 gearbits and having no idea where to look for the ones I've missed. The game gives you hints as to there being secrets nearby I suggest you look for those once you start the game so you don't realize halfway like me and go through everything again and recheck every corner. (They look like small little squares on the ground)\n\nAnother thing is I highly recommend playing this with a controller. You need to be fast in this game and moving around fast and precisely is pretty hard with a keyboard and mouse. It's much more enjoyable with a controller.\n\nLastly if you liked super brothers sword and sorcery you'll LOVE this.

Definitely, though be warned about bugs.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is an action-adventure RPG game in the vein of titles such as The Legend of Zelda and Diablo. Dropped into a world with hardly a clue of what is happening, you must travel to the four corners of the world (literally) and search for treasures scattered about to discover your destiny.\n\nWhile it's not the largest game world out there, HLD's world has plenty of atmosphere, character, and beauty. It is also littered with many different items, such as Gearbits and customization options for the Drifter, which inspires a bit of poking through every nook and cranny. The other half of HLD, the combat, is the main show. You can pull off different combos and strikes with the Drifter's Hard Light sword, which in turn charges your side arms (such as pistols and shotguns). The Drifter himself is also very nimble and can dash into and out of the fray.\n\nHowever there are some things that don't work too well, as with many things. One issue is the existence of various bugs, primarily for me have been random holes in the ground that are not noticable until walked into. The Drifter often does a hunched animation when near a ledge, and oftentimes I'll see it happen while walking on solid ground for no reason at all, then plummet into nothing and lose HP. Also for a game that has many hidden rooms in walls, it's frustrating to find holes in the ground that probably shouldn't be around at all. Another type of bug was one that blocked progress on a certain boss, requiring me to beat it 2 more times before being done with it.\n\nAs for the aforementioned plethora of collectables, it almost feels like a chore to find them all, especially with the confusing map system. While the map does have a "underground" linked rooms map, I find myself forgetting what important doors are where and end up wandering around the map for a while (though I guess that's the point of the game, to "drift" about). For the last few points I have, sometimes mechanics just don't work right and get frustrating, primarily dashing. Dashing requires a certain rhythm to continuously use and sometimes the game loves to just drop it, or not do it at all, making the "platforming" segments, even fights, a nightmare sometimes. And the music, while eerily relaxing and atmosphere-setting, sometimes gets WAY too loud during the various sight-seeing moments of the game.\n\nOverall, not a terrible game, though I'll have to come back at a later date to find everything, and when they release DLC. I recommend it, but maybe wait a little while for bugs and such to get sorted out?","April 2","true","15.2"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","18","26","2","0"

A faint summer breeze blushes against your cheek, then dies. Holding tight to your blade, you make your way though a magenta forest. The metalic taste of blood in your moulth reminds you that you don't have much time left.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a post apocalyptic tribute to classical Zelda games. You are a crimson traveler seeking a profaned crystal in hope of finding a cure for your illness. That is all I can tell about the story, not because I'm afraid of spoiling, but because it's fairly difficult to figure it out myself.\n\nMost of the story is told though the enviorment. Between the combat rooms, you travel though graveyards and laboratories, unraveling why the world came to what it is now. Impressive pixel art combined with an immersive ambience create a very strong atmosphere. So, even if you won't understand what you have played, you may still have a jolly fun experience.\n\nNow, the combat. The combat is generally quite simplistic and consists out of dashing, hacking away and occasionally using projectiles. Most of the challange comes from being forced to manage large groups of enemies. In a way, you can classify it as a bullet hell. The dash plays a key role in the game, as you are given a few moment of invincibility each time you use it. So, most of the time in the arena one will spend as a pink blur circuling around the room. The difficulty demands quick reaction times, up until you get the upgrades.\n\nTwo extra medkits, a shotgun and the abulity that allows you to deflect bullets back at the enemy have a tendency to make most encounters anticlimactic.\n\nAfter completing the game, you will probably realize that you've missed about 60 percent of the content, since most of that content is quite well hidden. Everybody is expecting to find a spare upgrade part under the stair case, yet items that unlock new areas and game modes are so criptic to find, that there is no way the majority of players will uncover them without consulting a walkthough.\n\nMy first playthough lasted about 10-12 hours and held my interest quite well. If you are a fan of dungeon crawlers set in a surreal apocalypse, mind giving this one a look. If you are hesitant, try picking this one up during the next Steam sale.\n","April 24","true","12.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","3"

No words... but its all there, beautifully rendered in imagery... artistic interpretation and a sense of imagination is needed to get the story.\n\nBut the game play is so awesome and 'simple' to pick up, that if you are the type to ignore the story, you can.\n\nDon't think for one moment though that 'simple to pick up' means easy though...\n\nYes, the game is forgiving with save points pretty often, and you just restart at that save point when you die.  Not if.  When.  You will die... often.  Get used to it.       (disclaimer - sure, someone out there somewhere will post a no-death playthrough eventually....)\n\nIts gorgeous, it scratched the zelda itch I had been nursing for some time... and a few other itches I didn't even know I had.... buy this damn game already!","April 8","true","0.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jdeb9/recommended/257850/","jdeb9","Jdeb9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jdeb9/","1097 products in account","----------------UPDATE-------------------\nI'm going to go back to playing easier games, like Dark Souls\n------------------------------------------------\n\nMy review will only be an initial one, as I haven't progressed much further through the game (so I won't comment on story quality yet).\n\nFirstly, if you're thinking of buying this game...when they say this game is recommended with a controller, they absolutely mean it. The keyboard controls are good, but the mouse aiming just doesn't quite work with the drifting mechanic, as often the direction you're indicating with the cursor will be drifted over, and so the direction of the NEXT drift is the opposite. So basically, joysticks all the way.\n\nThe actual gameplay is excellent, and there's a clear emphasis on the pacing of attacks for a hack'n'slash title. You can't simply ghost an enemy and spam them with melee attacks, as the melee attacks aren't instantaneous in their duration and therefore leave a window for you to be damaged. The pistol/gun is also limited in its ammo, and you must refill it by killing enemies. It means you can't simply spam the gun, as it won't get you through a battle alone. Gameplay wise, the drift mechanic is pretty fun. Apart from traversing gaps in the terrain, it melds well into battling enemies as a dodge mechanic. It also assists in breaking up battles with the previous discussed melee and pistol/gun attacks, and the game seemingly encourages you to alternate between them, which is reinforced by the enemy's attack patterns. Level progression is also extremely Zelda-esque, a large open world with marked objectives and certain areas to continue story progression. So there's linear story progression but in an open-world, though I don't know if this will split into multiple story missions at this point (though it could). The possibility of some degree of non-linear story progression is only suggested to be possible as some story missions require you to travel to fetch various segments that combined will unlock the next story segment, so there's a degree of non-linearity in mission completion as is (the closest example I can think of like this is FEZ cube requirements when unlocking new sections). Additionally, the game also implements an auto-save system, so dying will result in respawning either at the beginning of the level (often occurs in dungeons), or nearby before a battle area. While autosave locations can often be annoying, or make a game overly easy, they have been well implemented in Hyper Light Drifter and strike a good balance, being useful without affecting difficulty. I say this because the game can be f*cking hard at times and no number of saves is going to help you.\n\nWhere the game stands out is its audio and visuals, Disasterpeace delivering on another stellar soundtrack that really drives home the atmosphere of the environment drawn by the phenomenal pixel art. The illustrations are beautiful, and quite frankly, I've never seen pixel art better than this in a game. There are points in the game where you can just stop and look from piece to piece of the environment, noticing the detail put into each. I especially liked the detail put into the non-combat environments such the robots(?) frozen in time, covered with moss. It very much has Studio Ghibli's "Laputa: Castle in the Sky" appeal. It's hard to top this art direction, its been implemented perfectly.\n\nIt's also worth noting the 30 fps lock. While it certainly isn't desirable, I found it to be barely noticeable even when playing with a mouse + keyboard (as framerates have an immediately noticeable impact on the responsiveness of a mouse), so again, a controller is the safe choice and the preferred option for this game.\n\nSo far, so very, very good. I need to update this review when I can play it with a controller, but so far it's very much heading towards a "must own". Its hard to find games like this with such distinctive art direction and executed with such finesse, and actually giving back to the supporters instead of cr@pping on them with microtransactions etc.","March 31","true","14.0"," 26 of 44 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","26","44","0","0"

I made a poor first choice, then had to learn to use the chosen ability tactically in order to get by the difficult encounters which followed.\n\nMuch to explore, and a whole worlds worth of lore to uncover through scenery, subtle hints, and vague yet amazing picture-based story. The soundtrack is moody, atmospheric, and context based, with layers being added and removed to suit the scene.

But this game made a difference. In my opinion, Hyper Light Drifter is a game that you have to try out and make your own idea for the game, but here are the basic reasons of why I loved it so much.\nFirst of all, the creator of the game had this great idea of using pixels in this specific way. This makes it extremely realistic, something that I didn't expect from it. Moreover, almost every soundtrack in the game is catchy and related with the boss or region the character is located. Last but not least, I personally found it interesting to find secrets in the game, once it is really rewarding and it doesn't make it boring.\nBut enough for the pros, let's have a look at the cons. Firstly, there are a couple of glitches that are in the game, but they still don't ruin it and I am sure they will fix it in a couple of days. Secondly, the price is a really big problem, because I don't think that it worths 20 euros. I can't say, it's a really nice game, but a lower price would make it even better. In other words, if there will be any offer of this game, don't hesitate to buy it, or at least try it out and see how it goes.\nAll in all, it's a really nice game but I recommend you to buy it when it will be on an offer and once it will take a while, I think that the glitches will be fixed, too.","April 18","true","28.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game is gorgeous with fairly large areas and everything is just bursting with color. The soundtrack is extremely good and if you've played Fez, it's by the same guy and has a similar aesthetic (though i will say the town hub's song is a bit too fez like, to the point of copying IMO). Also, besides a few "press button to do this" tutorial messages in the begining (theres like 5 like how to shoot your gun or dash) that's been it for words. Just pictures which, also, look gorgeous.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/facialist/recommended/257850/","facialist","kinggimped","http://steamcommunity.com/id/facialist/","387 products in account","Been waiting with bated breath a couple of years for this game to drop. Every delay to the release has been greeted with a groan. Since yesterday's release I've only been able to play about 3 hours, but here's my experience of Hyper Light Drifter so far.\n\nFor starters, there is no hand holding. No tutorial. I can count on one hand the number of times text has appeared on the screen during the actual game. Everything is learned by the player through well-crafted level design, first forcing you to learn a mechanic in order to proceed, then gradually training you on the different situational uses of that mechanic until it becomes second nature. This creates a satisfying sense that you have learned something organically rather than simply being told how to do it. Mechanics are simple and easy to pick up, but challenging to use very effectively. Best of all, combat feels just as tidy and stylish as it looks.\n\nThe pixel art style is truly beautiful if you like that kind of thing. The levels are detailed and gorgeous with lots of little hidden pathways and small details. You're almost always rewarded for exploring and experimenting with combining your abilities with the level elements. The game leaves it entirely up to you where to go - there's no objective marker to follow. It starts you out at a crossroads and lets you dictate which direction you want to start exploring the world.\n\nAnimations are simple enough to fit the art style, but intricate enough that they immediately communicate what they're trying to communicate. The cut-scenes are remeniscent of the classic *Another World* / *Flashback* games from the 90s.\n\nAs much as the art is stylistically pretty, it is also extremely varied. There is very little in the way of copy-pasting when it comes to the level design. Every map feels individually crafted, every part of the world has a different feel. The ruins of the world you explore feel vast but deserted and creepy; caverns and other underground parts are suitably claustrophobic and atmospheric. It's amazing how such a simplistic art style is able to create such strong and varied atmospheres.\n\nThe combat is challenging to the point of punishing, but incredibly satisfying due to the incredibly tight controls. If you die, it's almost always your fault, and there's almost always something you can take from it. Enemy AI is varied but surprisingly smart - enemies will dodge and flank you, and you have to be precise with your movements. Mashing the sword button will certainly not automatically win engagements.\n\nYou will die a lot. If you don't like punishing games and would rather romp through a story without being challenged at all, this really is not a game for you. At all.\n\nThe checkpoint and fast travel systems are very well implemented. You barely notice they're there.\n\nThe music and overall sound design is incredible and one of my favourite features of the game so far. If you've been watching any of the trailers or know of Disasterpeace's work then you know what to expect - dark, atmospheric chiptune-esque beats that ebb and flow with the on-screen action. SFX are crisp and fit the game's style perfectly.\n\nOverall, I'm very much enjoying my experience so far with Hyper Light Drifter, and can't wait for work to be over so I can dive back in to the world.\n\nMy only criticism so far is minor: the game seems to be capped at 30fps. Nowadays it feels less smooth and satisfying than the 60fps I'm used to in most games, but particularly for a game with this kind of old-school pixel art style. While it hasn't hampered my enjoyment of the game itself it still seemed a strange limitation.","March 31","true","6.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Your guns charge their ammo as you hit things with your sword so the gameplay stays a good balance between shooting things and hitting things. You're never given more (maximum) HP or ways to take or deal more damage, with very few expections everything deals 1 or 2 damage, including your weapons.\n\nThe game rewards keen eye and exploration with things hidden in places you need some creative use of the dashing ability to reach or behind walls with some minor hints near them.\n\nThe story is told without any dialoque and doesn't get in your face constantly to distract you from the gameplay.\n\nIn the end this is probably one of the best games in this style I've played, highly recommend.","April 4","true","21.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I have never in my life, AAA games included ever been so absolutley stunned by the graphics of a game. This is one of if not the most atmospheric game I have ever played, the soundtrack, SFX and visuals come together to make one of the most perfectly beautiful things i have ever seen. Even if the gameplay was terrible i'd recommend this game just for the experience. However, i don't have to recommend it on the presentation alone because the gameplay is FANTASTIC. The three combat mechanics I've seen so far are all wonderful, and blend together perfectly. As of right now i have a gun, a sword, and a dash. The gun is filled via successful hits on enemies/breaking random containers in the world, which makes it fit well in combat as it gives you a powerful and satisfying ranged option whilst never invalidating the sword. The dash flows well in both explorative gameplay and combat, and is exactly the kind of ability that fits the weapons you're given in this game. This game is also difficult, with healing items seeming uncommon and enemies dealing large portions of your health in a single hit. This being said, the game never feels impossible or unfair. This will be, no doubt, my Indie GOTY 2016. I only have two issues with it so far, and both are very minor. The first issue is that you can easily click outside the fullscreen window, and because i have a second monitor i end up going too far right with my mouse sometimes, causing the game to tab out. However, after an hour of gameplay i've taught myself to just not do that and it's almost a nonissue at this point. [[THIS WAS PATCHED DAY 1]The second issue i have with this game is that the death/respawing animation seems to drag on, and (possibly because i'm trash) i die a lot in this game, and sitting there waiting really breaks this game's wonderful combat flow.] However, these two small issues overall don't detract from the gaming magnum opus that is: Hyper Light Drifter.\n\nTL;DR version\n\nGame is really pretty, the combat flows like a river, and issues are minimal.\n\n9/10","March 31","true","6.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Definitely feels like it has a Souls games influence in it. Most areas you will not be able to just button mash your way through. I died a few times before realizing that you really have to pay attention, every hit matters. The checkpoints are pretty generous which is nice, but health packs are fairly scarce (depending on how well you play). I seem to play just well enough to only have about 1 healthpack in reserve usually, so in my opinion it doesn't give you too much or too little, its a good balance and it makes you want to improve. There are plenty of little hidden areas if you pay attention, which give you upgrade materials as an exploratory bonus. The level design feels tight and connected.

You play as a character with access to a sword, various guns, and a dash. Combat consists of fighting off swarms of enemies with different attack patterns that require learning. With only five points of health and limited full heal kits, surviving takes limiting the hits you let yourself take and the timing/usage of your scarce healing.\n\nThe actual game world is a huge overworld interspersed with dungeons, secret locations, and beautiful, screenshot worthy resting places free of the combat's franticness, that just deserve a moment to take in. The world can be easily navigated physically through dashing to cross the many chasms and visually through the understandable map that shows both the surface and underground layers. There is a central city where you can upgrade your gear with the game world's currency. Surrounding this are the four major zones, which for the most part can be tackled in any order. Each zone has a different theme and different enemies to master. Each zone also has a major boss fight. Some may take a few deaths to fully master the pattern, but they are all very fair despite the challenge.\n\nThe game is a blast to play. Combat becomes a rhythmic mixup of swordplay and gun sniping as you work down large groups of enemies. There are a variety of collectables hidden throughout the game in many of the secret locations (hidden walls, out of the way platforms, etc). I've read complaints that wall hugging is needed at many points to find collectables, but the game does a very good job of subtly showing the locations of hidden places, either by having well placed visual indicators or by showing a peek at the location when you stand in certain spots. You know an area that you can't immediately access is there, so you'll be compelled to find the route to it. The game takes about ten hours or less to complete the main story based on my first playthrough of it. Yet, there is still more to do as I've yet to collect everything or start the game's new game plus mode.\n\nI definitely recommend this game. I've had a few bugs and a few crashes, but the developers have been working since launch with updates to smooth them out. The game has a great feel. Combat is fair, but it's still difficult and requires learning. Nothing beats the feeling of beating a particularly hard mob, and being rewarded with the silent protagonist mirroring your feeling of triumph by victoriously throwing his sword into the ground. It's great, it's fun, and it doesn't require a whole lot of time if you just want to beat it and move on. Go with this game if you like the genre and art of a 2D pixel game with challenging combat, and more importantly a lot of heart.","April 2","true","17.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abamita/recommended/257850/","abamita","Abamita","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abamita/","4 products in account","I am enjoying the game a lot. My biggest problems are with the dashing mechanic. Although I can use it proficiently, I still have three issues. The first is that, even when only brushing up against an object, the player gets knocked onto the ground. Considering how much clutter there is in the game, this is too unforgiving and deters use of the dash. Dashing feels much better when fighting a boss, because there is enough space to use it without hitting objects. There are no invincibility frames when dashing, so I don't think allowing slight collisions to slide would make dashing too safe.\n\nThe second problem involves the small cooldown timer when a dash finishes. Every time either a chain dash or a single dash is ended, intentionally or otherwise, it is momentarily impossible to dash. When the next dash is allowed to begin, however, it is actually made impossible to chain. It takes an additional second before another chain can start instead of a single, solitary dash. I think it would be preferable if the developers had made the earliest dash chainable and increased the initial wait time after the first chain ends. It's unsatisfying and frustrating to try to start another chain without knowing that it is actually impossible to do so.\n\nThe third problem is that, if a player performs a chain dash of over three dashes, they will slide along the ground uncontrollably when it ends. What this means is that a player will be punished for being exceptionally competent at dashing in combat. Sliding can send the player into pits or directly into enemy fire. If the developers had given the player some element of control during the slide, or if the slide took less time, it might have worked a lot better.\n\nThe music is a lot weaker than I had expected. Almost all of it is ambient and totally forgettable, whereas the trailer music was a great pleasure to listen to. There is nothing inherently wrong with the individual tracks, but they do not aid in forming the hills and valleys of the game's arc. The music is especially underwhelming during fights with the reprehensible cast of bosses, who deserved fearsome and energetic music to match their characterization. The music is written as though it always wants to stay out of the player's way, and it unfortunately succeeded. I had expected the music to be one of my favorite parts of the game, but that wasn't the case.\n\nTechnically, the game is unimpressive. There are a number of small bugs, although the debilitating ones are quickly getting patched out. The camera does not follow the player closely enough for the speeds the game allows them to reach, occasionally opting to observe a completely empty room. The camera is also positioned in such a way that many damaging falls are simply impossible to see due to the foreground. I am unsure why these ledges were not made into boundaries. I did not expect a perfectly programmed game from such a small team. All of the technical problems are forgiveable with the exception of the keyboard controls. The keyboard controls turn the game into a fight against the mouse, and I want to emphasize that if this game launched without controller support, I probably wouldn't recommend playing it. In their current state, the developers had an obligation to let players know that the keyboard controls are far inferior to a gamepad's, but I don't think that was made clear. Don't play the game on a keyboard.\n\nThose are my main gripes. I'm being critical, but this is one of my favorite games to come out of a small development team. The gameplay is slick and rewarding once players learn how to move fluidly, allowing them to smartly chip away at the enemy horde. At least half of the game's content is in the form of secret areas, meaning that players will discover the game rather than having it shown to them. This works in the game's favor, because it is a game you will want to explore. The pixel art is gorgeous and dreamy, and I've caught myself ceasing play a number of times to gaze at a background or watch the movements of one of the townsfolk. The unique design choice to remove almost all written language pushes the player to explore the foreign world even more. All of the ideas, stories, and item uses are easy to grasp thanks to clever imagery and are presented more effectively and emotionally than they might have been otherwise. The sound design also deserves a mention in this regard. The gutteral sounds made by the inhabitants of the world are always interesting, and the harsh electronic noises that the Drifter creates give a great sense of weight to all of his actions.\n\nAlthough a lot of people have been choosing to focus on the difficulty of the game, it is actually set very reasonably. Any young person with healthy reflexes should be able to beat the game with a good effort. If you have a history with action games, you will be able to finish this one. I personally wish the bosses had put up a better fight, since some of them came close to dying the first time we met. If the dash mechanics were a bit tighter, I'm sure every enemy encounter could have been made more intimidating without added frustration. Despite some visible seams, Hyper Light Drifter is undoubtedly a great game and experience.","April 7","true","19.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game's combat and special moves resemble Devil May Cry with gun-sword combat, deflecting projectiles, perfect-timed swings and platforming, the game also borrows a lot from Bastion’s top down game mechanics.\n\nThe pacing and level design of the game resemble more closely to a Zelda type game, with freedom to go to three available directions; East, North and West. In my playthrough I started with the North. At the North I learn hints of the backstory and lore through its environments and pictograms-dialog from engaging with the NPC. Talking about environments, there are secrets, hidden switches and hidden rooms everywhere, I once also found a hidden switch that lead to a hidden room with more hidden rooms. Which leads mean to say “Way too much wall hugging” thankfully there are community guides if you so wish to use them.\n\nIn conclusion, Hyper Light Drifter is blend of multiple great games, but does not simply just copy, but make it their own unique design and style.

Gameplay is really solid and the minimalistic nature of the art and storytelling within the game is nice too. I felt that the game was a little bit too short but it was still fun; the trailer made it seem like it was going to be bigger than just four areas/bosses. Replaying the game to find all the secrets and to get all the upgrades is pretty much the only reason I would play it again. It's a really solid game with challenging combat, but the only downside is that it's locked at 30 fps. It didn't bother me too much, but I know people who would not be happy with that.

THis game is challening right off the bat.  You have to figure things out on your own.  There is no dialouge written or spoken.  NPC's will give you back story/hints through pictures.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saveyourheart13/recommended/257850/","saveyourheart13","Nyxes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saveyourheart13/","302 products in account","(I’m new at “officially” reviewing things, so bear with me please.)\n\nFirst off, I  absolutely   recommend this game to anyone who’s considering buying it; however, I will warn that for some people it might be a tougher game than you'd think. That being said, the controls are rather intuitive (I played with a controller, so I can’t really speak for the keyboard and mouse experience), and I would advise that you don’t be afraid to experiment a bit in how you do things in order to find the best method for you. Second, advice if you do play the game: dodge, and dodge often, at least until  you get the ability to reflect bullets with your sword and/or dodge through bullet attacks without taking damage, and then it becomes dodge and reflect often .\n\n******************************************************************\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a game that’s far from easy, but not impossible either. The gameplay is very smooth and the controls are relatively easy to learn — but that doesn’t mean you’ll be  good  at everything right away. You’re thrown into a world that gives you very little and allows you to figure things out for yourself; in a sense, what you put into it is what you get out of it (particularly in terms of the story, but I’ll get to that in a bit). It’s a game that rewards you for secret-hunting, so be on the lookout for everything from secret passages to areas that you can dash to. You will die, and you’ll probably die often. And it will be frustrating at times (at least it was for me). But you’ll find yourself getting back up to try again and again until you get it, and that sense of accomplishment is oh-so-sweet once you make it.\n\n\nThe art in this game is absolutely gorgeous — the lighting is extremely well done, the colors are lovely, and I was surprised when I realized the reason everything looks so  smooth  is that the typical outline you see in pixel art is not there. The animations are extremely smooth, and even the death and resurrection animations are good (I will say I’m extremely glad they patched in the ability to speed up the resurrection animation, especially when you’re dying multiple times trying to defeat a boss). The music and sound design in general is absolutely beautiful as well, to the point where I’m still not tired of hearing it even after having a track loop for 30+ minutes straight as I try to defeat a boss.\n\nThe details in this game are extremely impressive, from the way your blood drops dissolve off the ground to the little victory sword thing your Drifter does when finishing a harder fight. The entire game progresses without a single word, everything being explained through pictures (or in the case of upgrades, little animations) and cutscenes; and yet, I feel like understood the story as well as I personally could have. The “important” characters (those that do more than make a little noise at you when you "ping" them) have their backstories told through pictures as well, and I felt oddly connected to them despite not having what would normally be considered "in-depth" information about them. Especially true for me in the case of  the other Drifter (possibly?), who’s in the same situation as you, or at least it seems that way . And I won’t lie — the ending gave me a few emotions, at least the way that I interpreted it.\n\n\nAll in all, this game is fantastic and I will definitely be playing quite a bit more of it to see what I can find and/or do. This is absolutely a game I recommend.","April 2","true","13.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/recommended/257850/","Jamfrost","Jamfrost Jamiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/","623 products in account","This game has mad style. Immediately, you’ll notice the pixel art is top notch. There are gorgeous vistas to stop and take a gander at when you’re not too busy with the fast-paced combat or looking for secrets. You’ll behold a devastated world filled with remnants of the past in 4 different environments located at each of the cardinal directions (NWES). The storytelling mostly comes from interpreting images and your surroundings as the games has no dialogue. Sometimes what’s happening is obvious because a bloody corpse says it blatantly. The game also runs only at 30fps which is puzzling considering how much zipping around you’ll be doing.\n\nLook at that view:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=658408701\n\nNow, the game doesn’t explain much and while that gives it an air of mystery with the story, it works against it in other parts. Do not accidentally sabotage your playthrough with poor initial upgrade purchases. Upgrades requires Gearbits and you need to find four pieces of them to make one. Making a bad upgrade purchase can cause large amounts of suffering because the combat/mobility upgrades should take priority over anything else. My recommended upgrade path is the sword projectile reflect and chain dodge first, then the dodge projectile shield. From there you can safely branch out and grab whatever upgrade you want. I foolishly grabbed an ammo upgrade before grabbing the sword projectile reflect ability which gave me some serious problems in the Eastern Zone with the ranged enemies. Don’t do what I did. Also know that you can fast travel at almost any time to an activated waypoint, so don’t be afraid to try out the other paths to find more bits.\n\nCombat isn’t about pulling off sweet 100-hit combos and increasing the score multiplier. It’s about timing, mobility, positioning, and skilled execution. You’ll find yourself frequently dodging to and from enemies as you quickly decide to attack or retreat. Dodges don’t have any invincibility frames and enemies have collision so move carefully. Your character will have access to different guns, starting with the pistol. However, the aiming mechanic is extremely clunky. You hold Left Trigger to pull out the gun, aim with the Left Stick, and then fire with the Right Trigger. Your character has to stand still during that whole process which can mean taking hits while trying to shoot. Aiming my shot by facing the enemy before squeezing the Right Trigger worked out much better, especially with the shotgun. For example, you can dodge or run towards an enemy, fire away with RT, then dodge/run away, all without bothering with the terrible aiming mechanic. Hitting with the sword and then firing right after works well too. You’ll need to watch out for enemies or hazards that can knock you down because you’re not safe on the ground. You can be killed while lying down and some bosses will knock the wind out of you.\n\nEach zone has a big bad and those bosses are all about learning patterns and using your tools. They’re not easy foes. I’ve died to all the bosses multiple times before emerging victorious. They have a set pattern and a pattern changeup once you remove enough of their health. Usually this means they’ll speed up, add another attack, or possibly summon adds (enemies). I found myself counting their attacks and looking for their tells in order to overcome them. If you pay enough attention, each attempt will bring you closer to victory as you learn their tactics and counter with your own. I really liked the final boss. The fight was a satisfying and challenging experience. I defeated it with a well-executed reflection of 8-10 projectiles at point blank range. That felt way too good. Mmm.\n\nFinally, in addition to the upgrade woes I mentioned earlier, there are other areas where this game stumbles. The map isn’t very helpful and doesn’t mark any of the collectables except for modules, things necessary for game progression though you can find bonus ones. Its rooms are displayed as basic shapes with the paths that connect them. Your player icon will not be accurately positioned to your true location. I didn’t use it much except for fast traveling and occasional path checking for making sure I’m heading down the right chain of rooms when underground.\n\nThe chain/infinite dodge never felt responsive to me and was sometimes hard to control. This issue could be related to the game running at 30fps. I am not sure. The chain dodge is the main method of traveling quickly. It’s also much faster than the normal 3 dodges at a time. The issue comes from the timing which struggles to feel consistent. Also, the more chain dodges you manage, the faster the timing becomes and those windows are very picky. Sometimes you’ll come to a dead stop if your second button press is off. Or you’ll mess up a third or fourth press which makes your character slide for a considerable amount of distance. The slide looks cool until you realize you’re going off a platform. Sometimes you’ll just slam into a wall and bounce when zipping around. I fell off platforms quite often and I had moments where my second button press left me on top of a disappearing platform instead of starting the chain. For the most part, chain dodging is manageable despite the false starts and slides. It’s also fun when you figure out the tempo, but its unreliability becomes a major problem when trying do some of the optional activities.\n\nMy last criticism is about how some of the secrets are handled in this title. In short, some of them are either tedious, frustrating, or both. One of them involves reaching a chain dodge number of 800 in the dodge shop. That’s 800 dodges in a row which is possible with the upgrade, but maybe should be avoided. I think my top score was around 60 or more. There was also this crystal room with a cosmetic reward at the end. You had to navigate a long and winding hall with 90 degree turns where the floor was mostly covered with crystal hazards by chain dodging. These crystals turn into big dangerous crystals soon after you pass over them that knock you down for 2 damage. My knocked out character would sometimes land on other crystals and succumb to a fatal crystal chain. If you manage to pass all the hazards, you’re then greeted by a room full of mobs and crystal spiders that encase you in a crystal if they touch you. You can take damage and be killed while encased and have to start from the beginning. That place showed me how flawed the chain dodge was. Or maybe that was a bad room. Throughout the game, I just wasn’t too enthusiastic about secrets unless they were hidden Gearbit pieces.\n\nOverall, the game provided me with a good experience, a memorable final boss fight, sweet tunes, and a great amount of style. The game could have been better in the areas I’ve mentioned before, especially with that map. The movement and combat could have benefited from having 60fps.","April 8","true","8.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Similar to the Dark Souls games you can heal mid fight, but you are completely vulnerable for a second while you heal. I only fought one boss so far, but the difficulty level seemed perfect. The difficulty outside of boss fights is more on the easy side, since the game hides health packs at every second corner.\n\nThe world has a beautiful design, that took some heavy inspiration from Neon Genesis Evangelion, and offers quite a bit of freedom for exploration. You are not forced into a linear path, but rather given the choice to explore whichever part of the world you want to start with. The soundtrack has the typical Disasterpeace feel that is reminiscent of FEZ and fits the game quite nicely.\n\nSo far I haven't run into any major bugs, only some animals that were stuck running into a wall and one or two walls that you could walk through that didn't seem intentional. However one major issues with the game is the lock to 30 fps. While it is perfectly playable at that framerate it would look a lot smoother in 60 fps.","March 31","true","14.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The music, the art, the gameplay is all fantastic. Some people say the difficulty is unnecessarily cruel. I haven't hit a big difficulty spike yet, but I don't actually know. The most difficult thing so far was understanding the mechanics. But that's easily remedied via usage of a guide, which I reckon beats the whole purpose of this game but to each his/her own I guess.\n\nAlso, it is the most responsive 30 FPS game I've ever played. So, if that's keeping you from buying, don't let it.\n\nI had been hearing about this game for many, many years now and I'm very happy to see that it all came together.

It's definitely not an easy game, nor does it tells you anything about the world directly (there are literally no words in game beyond menu).\nVibrant colors and very interesting world only adds to the great atmosphere this game has.\nJust exploring for secrets is a joy, in my opinion.\nMelee combat feels pretty solid, all enemies have their own attack patterns that you have to learn, bosses are amazing to fight against.\nStoryline is.. hm.. I guess "intriguing" would be the best word here. Since you'll have to figure it out yourself from a set of images.\nSome people actually called it "lazy" (it might as well be so), but I'd found it to be pretty interesting.\n\nOn other hand we have a bunch of very annoying things - 30fps lock, very poorly thought through aiming system, poor keyboard and mouse support, lackluster progression system.\nI mean, you can still play with all of those, they are definitely not game breaking.\nBut missing a crucial shot or dashing off the cliff is not that unusual for this game. And considering how hard can some of the battles be - this might be mildly infuriating.\nProgression system is probably my biggest gripe here - it could've been so much more, yet it's just a bunch of unlock that you cannot get unless you explore for secrets to find currency for them. And some of those are really well hidden and can take a while to find. Not everyone will like that.\n\nSo, if you can ignore those issues and just play the game for the world, exploration and boss fights - you'll find to enjoy it quite a bit.\n\nWatch my video for more in-depth look here:\nhttps://youtu.be/aUsfG_0CDG4","April 6","true","6.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Plus, the controls feel unnatural, and there's no way to customize them. All that combined with the challenge level of the game leads to me just getting frustrated at dying over and over again and not having any motivation to keep playing.","April 1","false","1.3"," 121 of 236 people (51%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","51","121","236","13","24"

Thats not how you make exploring fun.\n\nGoing back to places to refil on healthpacks (or just die on purpose in an area because you lost too much health there) isnt fun.

I feel they were going for an old school zelda 1 feel but it falls flat story wise, even for a game that is solely about adventuring.  In zelda 1 the game clues you in to why you have to collect the tri-force pieces. you collect them to save Zelda and to have a chance to stop Gannon. In drifter though you collect shards for access to boss rooms? (i'll edit this part when I go back in if i'm just being an idiot). If you collect 4 you are privy to a meaningless cutscene that basicly shows you the opening again. What i'm getting at is the story feels so pretentious  that the team forgot to write a story with purpose. I'm all for no word storytelling, but they dropped the ball on this one.\n\nTL;DR The game sufferd from the Peter Molyneux Effect and it was so close to acheivng what I belive the team set out to make, but they just wern't there.\n\nWould I recomend the game? If you just want to turn off and not care then yes, but if you are someone who likes to understand why you are doing the things you do in the game, then no.\n\n(I know this has nothing to do with the game but this rubbed me the wrong way. I don't know what these people did but in the special thanks I saw a scam artist (Tim "money furnace" Schafer) and two professional victims (Anita Sarkeesian and Zoe Quinn) I know i'll get flak gor this, but why would associat with them?)\n","April 13","false","6.0"," 25 of 48 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","25","48","0","4"

This game perfects a method in creating an experience, in telling a story, that goes beyond conventional narration and theme. It does this by both hiding and slowly revealing details at a pace that leaves you always grasping for more, but always satisfied by what you've discovered. While there are no words and the only communication with other characters is through sets of descriptive images of scenes, the player will understand the purpose and meaning of Hyper Light Drifter if they look carefully enough. You have one simple goal in Hyper Light Drifter, explore and uncover powerful artifacts of the past. Your motivation is as simple and deadly as any in the real world, a terminal and mysterious illness. As you explore more and more of the beautifully drawn and animated world of Hyper Light Drifter, you'll discover the dark secrets of the hidden past and why the Drifter is going down this path. The biggest strength of this game might actually be the ambiguity the story telling allows. Similar to games like Journey in this respect, you'll fall in love with Hyper Light Drifter becuase it lets you unravel the mystery of events in the game's universe rather than shouting a plot at you. This gives a special and personal significance to the character of the Drifter and the circumstances that befall him in the player's heart, not because they are told to like the character, but because they discover they do through their own experience controlling him. I DEFINITELY recommend this game, you will fall in love if you appreciate the deep care and effort an artist puts into their work. With the wonder of a Miyazaki film and the depth of a Souls game, Hyper Light Drifter is one of the best games to come out in the last year, and Heart Machine deserves much more credit than what they're already given for creating it.

Challenging, without being ridiculously hard.\n\nI got this game because it looked very atmospheric and chill in the video. While the game is very beautiful, and has some atmospheric(ness) to it, it's definitely not very chill (which is fine). It can be quite challenging and nerv wrecking at times. The map was not done very well and can cause some headaches sometimes with figuring out where to go. So prepare to explore alot. Also, this game has no text in it. Meaning, no characters talk to you with text (only images) and the upgrades aren't described well. The upgrades not being described well is pretty annoying when you're first getting the hang of the game, but you'll figure it out eventually. All in all, absolutley worth buying. You'll enjoy it, I promise!\n\nPros:\nGreat soundtrack\nVery fun gameplay\nCool graphics\nGreat controls\n\nCons:\nCrashes once ever 2 hours or so\nDifficult to navigate with the map\nUpgrades not explained well","April 11","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a very simple, straightforwad game that marks a lot of boxes in terms of amazing game design and concise yet satisfying storytelling. VERY low amount of instruction, and the design does a great job making sure you get a handle of the controls and movement just moments after starting. From what I understand, the game is also non-linear, which is my favorite part so far. The soundtrack is also incredible. Very ambient and compliments the world tremendously. Disasterpeace never fails to impress.\n\nThe only con I see in this game is difficulty and how dying is handled. The difficulty can spike in certain areas in terms of platforming and combat. This isn't too bad because you have infinite lives. HOWEVER, every time you die, there is a 3-5 second animation that plays when your character respawns. I know it doesn't sound like an inconvenience, but in areas where you are constantly dying from trying to figure out a platforming puzzle, it makes for a bit of a frustrating experience. As far as I know there is no way to skip this animation.\n\n(EDIT: You can now hold down A and X to speed up the respawn animation!)\n\nEXTRA NOTE: As of writing this, Steam says I have 7.6 hours of this game logged. I'd like to let it be known that about 2 hours of that was spent trying to reach 800 chain dashes in the dash shop area. I finally accomplished it.

Take away the ability to pause combat, and imagine a much more visceral and immediate gaming experience.  You have to plan your approach to combat in this game, but you don't have the luxury of the pause, zoom out, carefully place precise movements phase of combat: everything happens quite quickly.  The game is just as beautiful, but in a more ambient (sountrack) and expansive (world) way.\n\nFor fans of Japanese action rpgs: imagine a later Ys game.  Now give yourself a gun.  Cover with a layer of lovely pixelated aesthetic flair.\n\nAnd now a comparison that should work for any gamer: Hyper Light Drifter is a Zelda game that really makes you work for it.\n\nOne last thing: don't imagine Dark Souls.  Yes, the game is difficult.  Yes, the story is told in an organic, non-scripted way.

Then you had yet another chocolate cake with some cherry drizzle on it (Bloodborne) in 2015. Theres another big chocolate cake in 2016 too, but you start to feel that even though you really love the cake, you are kind of getting tired of it.

Hyper Light Drifter is an exception to this. Throughout playing I was constantly wondering what new things I would find to teach my about the world around me, as others may have as well. finding new costumes, keys, and a flurry of other secrets have led me to love this game for the short time it has been out. Hyper Light Drifter truly is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma from the expansive world presented to you and the lore of the titans that you see, scattered around the four corners of the world. guided by none other than your own curiousity, the game thrusts you in, with little context to your journey. faced with dire situations where enemies charge you and you have nothing but your wits, your sword, and your pistol to defend yourself. I wholeheartedly recommend Hyper Light Drifter and the story it tells to anyone and everyone. That is, if you can handle it.","April 5","true","19.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AndryDaBear/recommended/257850/","AndryDaBear","AndryBoBandry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AndryDaBear/","276 products in account","TL;DR Version:\n? Is locked on 30fps (A lot of people have a problem with this, I and my group of friends do not. If this is a problem for you, you should not play)\n+ Game has solid controls\n- Has had issues with mouse and keyboard\n+ Game has amazing Visuals and atmosphe\n+ Interesting Bosses and overall enemy types\n- Has had major bugs\n- The map sucks\n+ Combat is fun\n+ Difficulty is as many said "Right on the edge, but never going into ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T levels"\n+ Lots of oppurtunity for exploration.\n\nLong Version:\n\nFirst off don't let the few hours on my steam profile make you think I don't know what the heck I'm talking about with this game. I previously bought the GOG version clocked in roughly 12 hours on the game, and have actually completed it but not 100%.\n\nTake yourself back to the age of the Super Nintendo, back when games were starting to be both very visually appealing and fun. This game is a lot like an older Nintendo game, but it flows better than most older games. The inputs and combat are very solid. Not perfect I have been hit by an enemy I should have killed when I finished my sword swipe, more than a few times, but the issues with combat are very minor. They never left me in a position where I would die.\n\nThe visuals and atmosphere of this game are absolutely amazing. I will be honest I only bought this game because the pixel art for it looked stellar. I was not displeased with any of the art throughout the game. Every level, every enemy, ever character, item, ect. has so much personality and detail put into it. I think this game is one of the most beautiful pixel art games I have seen in years, and hope this is the start for indie developers to pick up their pixel art game. (Not knocking indie companies, since many of them are tiny with few resources. I just hope more indie games start looking this good.)\n\nThe story is honestly a little hard to follow since nobody in the game talks with words. Instead we are given more amazing pixel art to look at. I feel as though each person is supposed to see these pictures and take away what they want with those as the game goes on. I do know you are a Drifter and you have to fight a bad monster or the world will properly end, but not much esle besides there's another Drifter with a tragic life. Now I haven't 100% the game so there might be plenty of story goodies with finding more things in the world. I feel a little more given to the player would help the story tremedously, but then again a lot of older games had little to no real story in the actual game.\n\nThe bosses and enemy types are great. The first time a new enemy jumps you, you might get your butt kicked, but over time you learn how this enemy fights and can defeat him. Many compare this to Dark Souls and claim its difficulty is better or worse than Dark Souls. Now I could go into detail on how they are fundamentally two vastly different games overall and the only similarity between them is the player is expected to learn enemy behavior to take advantage and defeat that enemy, but I'll simply say the challenge in this game is very reasonable. I mean if you die, no matter how many times, to a boss you literally respawn right outside the boss room to try again. The only thing that gives me a problem are the traps and that's just because I'm an idiot with the dash ability.\n\nThis game is locked at 30fps. If this causes you issues, don't buy this game.\n\nIn conclussion I think this game is great and hope there is more to come with this setting. I give this game a 9/10 due to some issues with how the game controls on PC and some of the early bugs. Oh yeah the map to this game is pretty vague and overall hard to understand. It wasn't bad enough for me to give it a negative since I never used the map except to get a basic idea where I was a couple times.\n\nBesides those things this game is quite great if you are looking for a game with good challenge and a lot of great exploration.","April 5","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've waited for this baby to show up in the Steam Store, brutal and beautiful, and I was not disappointed by what I saw. In fact, I was quite the opposite - I was most certainly impressed.\n\nRead ahead and you too will have no choice but to purchase this DOUBLE fine game:\n\nWHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THIS GAME?    GRAPHICS - Holy ♥♥♥♥, do you see these screenshots? They may be pixel art, but look at the meticulous attention to detail in the enviornment! I'm a sucker for good pixel art, and this game is pretty much the epitome of just that. It's like the developer was playing Dungeon of the Endless in his spare time and wanted to make an ode to Amplitude Studios or something.\nGAMEPLAY - Hard, but not unfair. The game plays as a explorative rogue-like with an RPG twist, and before I start rambling about how HUGE it is, let's point out exclusively that this game is HARD. You will die constantly if you have never practiced dodging everything on the screen with only a couple of health points to spare. But, it treats like the older brother you love - sternly, but lovingly.\nSTORY - There are no words in this game. Imagine how hard it is to tell a good story with words. Now imagine doing the same thing, without words. Like Redford's movie All is Lost, this game is a marvel to look at through the art and interactions of various mute NPCs.\nWHAT'S MEDIOCRE ABOUT THIS GAME?    STORY - Now, although the story is good to explore without words, the game is incredibly vague. You have an idea of what is going on with the corruption (if that's what it is?), but without any solid context, you are writing your own story as you good. I don't believe that was what the developer was going for, so he cut a little short here. Still, not too bad - you can still grasp the general idea of your blue hero.\nTUTORIAL - While I do not particularly enjoy the idea of giving mandatory tutorials, an optional one would've absolutely lovely. Or even a training course incorporated into your city hub. Because the monsters outside of said hub are unrelentless, I would've liked it if I, the noobie, could've practiced dodging shots and dashing side to side. Alas, I had to learn the hard way.\nWHAT'S BAD ABOUT THIS GAME?    ART - Not the art design, execution, etc. but the fact that I don't know whether the thing I'm jump on is actually a ledge or just a decoration. I can jump on floating islands and boats, but is that lily pad a way to a secret? Nope, there goes a health point. Perhaps if the pointer changed colors or something to indicate that you can actually land on that texture, it would've been MASSIVELY helpful. For a game that's based on exploration, I find it unacceptable to have my hero drown himself over and over again because lilies are not made for standing.\nThis is one of those few games that I did not have to wait for a sale to buy, and I recommend that you don't wait either. This is game is a blast, and it's always very rewarding to know that you have the mechanical skills (or will achieve them) to outfight, outdodge, and outwit your enemy. Plus, look at those BEAUTIFUL, EXPANSIVE pixel graphics. My eyes sparkle every time.\n\n9.5/10","April 8","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Atomspheric music and settings.\nStarts off quick: just an opening cutscene and you're in. There's no dialogue at all in the game so you don't get bogged down by long stories or tutorials.\nYou find your way pretty naturally due to the linear nature of the hub. You can only go so far in a direction you're not supposed to yet. That said, there's branching paths and LOADS of hidden secrets.\nCombat's a big focus and it's pretty fun. Dynamic attack patterns from even common enemies is nice.

Reward stems solely from learning the intricacies of combat. With a few unlockable abilities you are highly mobile, easily able to evade or deflect any incoming attack. But, executing these moves with confidence takes practice and HLD doesn't shy away from punishing you for your errors.\n\nLike the most successful action games, HLD is undeniably cool and stimulating when you fall into its flow. But, this rhythm-harmony is hard to achieve, demanding practice and your undivided attention. Lose it and you'll find yourself completely open to attack or looking at the black death screen -- your colorful sprite lying in a pool of his own blood.\n\nCombat is HLD's most interesting element. You are equipped with a sword that has a single attack combo and a pistol that recharges whenever you attack with the sword. The pistol is just as useful as the sword--even in boss fights--which is an unexpected triumph. Enemies with 2 or 3 hit points can be disposed of with one sword combo, a few pistol shots, or a couple reflected projectiles. Those with more health need a few sword combos and a few shots to take down. But, after completing a single 3-swing combo, your sprite is locked in a sort-of rest animation that leaves you open to attack. Each sword strike has to be timed and enemies never get stunned. Mess up the dash's galloping rhythm and your sprite will slide across the ground for a couple seconds as you helplessly try to regain control. Some guns(yes, there is more than one) have a short cooldown in between shots that can really throw you off if you're not careful. But these moments where, suddenly, combat grinds to halt for a brief couple of seconds really separates it from a generic hack 'n slash requiring little-to-no deliberation.\n\nWith life-threatening challenges around every corner, satisfaction arises from skill-based consistency in battle. This may be a point of issue for some. The nonlinear structure of the game means every area has a similar level of difficulty (excluding the Southern area which isn't immediately accessible). The hardest area will most likely be your first. Although, if you care enough to explore the late game content, there are rooms that will definitely test your skills. But, these rooms always feel extra and are never necessary for progressing through the main game.\n\nHLD presents itself as a very mysterious game and its ambiguity harms more than it helps. NPCs speak in hieroglyphics that resemble symbols you've seen elsewhere. A monitor in your bedroom displays a cryptic diagram. Nothing is explained, save for a few basic controls. After a few hours you will know everything the game has to offer and be left with the matter of finding them. The problem is that you'll think the game has more to offer than it actually does. Much like the NPCs that tell stories in slide-show form, these mysteries are to be seen, not to engage with. They are surface level, solely there to build the world, not to solve.\n\nOn the whole, the ambiguity of its story, characters, and goal prevents HLD from building tension around any particular confrontation or moment. HLD tries to with it short opening cinematic, NPC stories, and one reoccurring nightmare sequence but it's all too little and all too vague. This, coupled with the game's open structure, results in an experience that never escalates to a satisfying conclusion. However, the game has a consistent, dark tone and an atmosphere that is filled with dread. Visually, the game can be dark and frightening as you journey far below the surface. It can be bright and beautiful as you wander through a crystal forest and even epic, with once mobile giants, now forever petrified in stoic backgrounds. HLD combines sci-fi and fantasy in a unique way and it is difficult to not be drawn into its world.\n\nIndividual areas are visually and structurally different, distinctly separate from one another.\nUnlike the game as a whole, each area escalates in the form of sequentially more difficult arena-style battles, climaxing with a boss encounter. Areas will have their own enemy types and combinations, often mixed together in a way that will keep you constantly juggling strategies. Boss fights present proper challenges, spurring the ferocity of combat to new heights in two-phase, lengthy confrontations. Enemy and boss design are both well-done and serve as one of HLD's strongest features.\n\nHLD's biggest problem is its exploration. The map is not really all that helpful. There are three things you're looking for in the game: purple triangles, stone tablets, and keys. Purple triangles are the only items that are mandatory for completion and you only need to find half of them. They are displayed on the map, but are still difficult to find. If you don't want to spend countless hours prowling the world for an item, you won't have to. Finding what is necessary for completion is a fun task that gives you proper time to master the deep combat mechanics. But, if you were looking forward to losing yourself in Hyper Light Drifter intriguing world, trying to piece together an various elusive secrets, I suggest you tailor your expectations.\n\nAfter you have found all the purple triangles, the map is useless. The game doesn't aid in your search for the stone tablets and offers no help finding any of the 16 hidden keys. The environments are riddled with hidden passages, offscreen switches, and invisible platforms. If you are trying to collect everything prepare to run along every wall, every side of every platform, and to dash occasionally off a platform just...because...maybe...\nIt starts to feel tedious. Burn every bush with a red candle.\n\nThe exploration doesn't require any clever use of logic. There are no clues, no puzzles, and really no meaningful reward for end-game exploration. The items you get for finding these secrets are almost always cosmetic. They may boost, for example, the recharge time of your grenades, but nothing you find will alter the way you play the game or the way the game feels. It is a shame that a game with great mechanics fails to offer diversity within them. Only two upgrades, which I acquired quite early in the game, really gave me something new to experiment with, to practice. There is a NG+, where you have 2 hit points and a new outfit. If you are trying to find everything, NG+ is the same exploration with a handicap, but if you are looking for one final test of your combat skills, NG+ will definitely provide it.\n\nIf you are looking for an indie action game to enjoy casually, a game that eases you into concepts and methods and presents an escalating series of challenges up until the end, this might not be the game for you. HLD is almost always a challenge. Even the earliest enemies have the potential to destroy an experienced player. Still, Hyper Light Drifter's atmosphere, world, and combat are all engaging enough to warrant a purchase and worth a good deal of hours spent exploring.","April 8","true","43.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However since I gave it the appropriate hype It was actually better than I already thought it would be.\nMajor elements\nSmooth movement and a very steep learning curve at the beginning, this game is truely to be admired for its level of pure expertise put into every section. Every area I walk down is beautifully handcrafted pixel art, the best pixel art I have personnaley ever seen. A story, that on the surface, is simple but has so much depth within it. Set in a world similar to ghiblies nausica and the valley of the wind dystopian world. With a war long forgotten yet still leaving its imprints on the world around you. Great giant beasts long dead. And a very mysterious antagonist of dark power who is somehow a figment of your sickness but much more. A creature resembling a dog of great power that somehow, needs your help.\nI gathered all this from pictures and the landscape around you. Its a visual story and an excellentley beautiful pixel one at that.\nGameplay\nTo put it as simpley as I can, legend of zeldas top down sword gameplay combine with a dash move that you have to master to not get hit. With the added bonus of a large mix of weapons to boot. And upgrades that basically add a whole new way to play but also make certain tasks slightley easier. There are also health packs which are scattered across the level to insta heal your tiny block health bar. And ammo that us used for all your weapons in your inventory recharged by slashing your enemies to pieces. You may also cross pits by dashing over them which can be sped up by spike traps littered on the platforms.\nIn short:\nA hack'slash'n'dash with guns and Isometric platforming. With pin prick accurecy built in to it all.\nLevel design\nThe level design here is just ♥♥♥♥ing beuatiful. Not only leading to intresting enemy encounters, but multiple paths to traverse the area and traps like sentries or spike traps to boot. There is a very adventureous feel to it and backtracking for mysterious never gets old because of the beautiful landscape or new items you find on the search. Puzzels and secrets are very well hidden but in a way to be enjoyable enough to find with the right amount of effort giving a great pay off when eventually do find them. The isometric parkour adds a lot as well, being so accurate that even non intentional areas can be landed on, which in my opinion is a blessing and a curse in the best ways especially because of the dash. The world itself is split up into 3 sections a forest, a snowey mountain and a aquaduct each with different types of difficultey but being about eqaul in how hard they are. Each one is better suited for certain abilities within the game that you can buy. There also warp gates you can activate inside the worlds which better help you replenish your ammo an health and make travel easier. While I won't spoil anything, the south area can only be played last.You acess all these worlds through a main hub world where you can purchase upgrades and do little minigames.\nTo sum it up:\nLegend of zelda's multiple worlds with a hub world, underground and upper ground gmaeplay and isometric parkour. With many traps and puzzels.\nMusic\nIt has the stylings of a mix of adventure 8bit music, varieing in different areas with a slight Journey instremental thing going on. Its pleasurable to listen to and doesn't get to repetative when your listening to the same track. A beuatiful OST with a very slow and mysterious theme only picking up during boss fights. It is almost always a beuatiful noise to listen to.\nSo very simple put:\nA very mysterious, mood setter sound track that does it job very well. Not somthing I'd listen to while working though. Just excellent for what its meant to do. I love hearing it every time I enter a different room with different music.\nGraphics\n( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\nThis is the best pixel out right now, no competition. Everything is beautiful to look at, everything is very well hand crafted, with beautiful backgrounds to suit. The shading and waters effects are *kiss kiss* un le buea. Though if you get motion sick easily then the backgrounds moving with you will make you very, very ill. but everything in the art department is basically perfect.\nin short:\nThe best pixel art in the world right now.\nBoss fights:\nOne of the biggest parts of the game, the boss fights lead up to the end of an area. They are also all almost impossible without better weaponrey. Ludicrousley hard without upgrades. And all with loving time in care into there very clever attack patterns. Though somtime I question their design choices. Each has a melee a ranged and a splash but the way they are dished out is very different (I think 2 don't have melee (-_- ;) ) You may find the bosses unfair, but once you've learnt their attack pattern you have no one to blame but yourself.\nIn basic:\nBasic Isometric boss ideas, made creativley\nThe game breaking glitch:\nI think this might be steam fault but my game keeps crashing on the end credits. This pisses me off to no end. Also don't leave it alone for to long then come back because the frame rate will dip like nachos in sauce.\nSummarey:\n10 capes outta 10\n-Excellent combat system\n-Zelda gameplay style with a unique spin\n-A no word story\n-The best pixel art currentley on the market\n-Isomextric platforming with great acuracy\n-Epic level design\n-mestyrious music design\n-Basic boss ideas with great new takes on them\n-Upgrades that make the game feel diffrent :O\nAnd all for its cheap price tag on steam at £15.00 (£14.99 = $21.33) is worth every penny and more\n\n\n9.5/10 because 10 is just unreachable, nothing is perfect. This is prettey close.\n\nThis game barley ever gets old unless you do the same room again and again and again so its got great replayability to that 100%\n\nminor negatives\n-disturbingley steep boss learing curve at the beginning of the game\n-Accidental deaths through unpredictable cirumstances\n-Frame rate dips from playing to long\nand a personnel not of I can not beat the game until steam bucks up how well it can handle the ♥♥♥♥ing end credits XD\n-a game prone to motion sickness for those with that problem ;(...","April 1","true","60.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hyper Light Drifter is HARD. Not impossible, not completely hardcore insane, not even your run-of-the-mill roguelike or bullet hell shooter hard, but it will definitely challenge casual gamers who are looking for a fun and relaxed experience.\n\nAnd what an experience it is. Not quite metroidvania, not quite soulslike, yet drawing from both, this game will see you exploring environments rendered in lovely pixel art, occasionally fighting monsters and doing a little platforming before fighting a boss at the end of each area. Right from the beginning, the game lets you go in three different directions, letting you choose what path to take and which bosses to take on first.\n\nBoth combat and platforming rely heavily on your dash ability, which you have from the start. Many enemies have dash attacks as well, so combat often becomes a wonderful dance of timed dodges and quick counter-attacks, and the first time you finish a large encounter and your enemies lie in pieces at your feet, you will feel like a god!\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game on what little I have played. But like I mentioned earlier, this game is not for everyone. I'd just like lastly elaborate on the difficulty so you know exactly what you are getting into:\n\n- Bosses are VERY aggressive and deal a large amount of damage, and will change their attack patterns over the course of the fight. You will be overrun by adds, and stunlocked while attempting to heal. Your health bar is pitifully small, so sometimes you could go from full health to 0 HP in under a second. You will die. A lot. There are abilities you can buy to complement your arsenal and skills, but apart from the ability to carry an additional medkit, I have yet to find anything that would actually really help you stay alive if you aren't that confident in your abilities in the first place.\n\n- Apart from the bosses, there are a number of occasions when you are locked in a room with a large number of enemies. If you die, you restart at a previous checkpoint, but with the same amount of HP and medkits you had going in, so if you were low on supplies to start with, you might have a lot of trouble. Remember that you can always teleport out to the hub, and go farm some medkits and try again.\n\n- In the style of many oldschool 2d games, secrets in this game sometimes involve a lot of just running up against every wall in the hopes of finding a hidden passage. Sometimes they are well telegraphed, with clues in the environment, but other times it felt like dumb luck. At times this can get quite frustrating.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game. It's just not for everyone. If you like this type of game however, you would do well to check it out.\n\n","March 31","true","19.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a very simple, straightforwad game that marks a lot of boxes in terms of amazing game design and concise yet satisfying storytelling. VERY low amount of instruction, and the design does a great job making sure you get a handle of the controls and movement just moments after starting. From what I understand, the game is also non-linear, which is my favorite part so far. The soundtrack is also incredible. Very ambient and compliments the world tremendously. Disasterpeace never fails to impress.\n\nThe only con I see in this game is difficulty and how dying is handled. The difficulty can spike in certain areas in terms of platforming and combat. This isn't too bad because you have infinite lives. HOWEVER, every time you die, there is a 3-5 second animation that plays when your character respawns. I know it doesn't sound like an inconvenience, but in areas where you are constantly dying from trying to figure out a platforming puzzle, it makes for a bit of a frustrating experience. As far as I know there is no way to skip this animation.\n\n(EDIT: You can now hold down A and X to speed up the respawn animation!)\n\nEXTRA NOTE: As of writing this, Steam says I have 7.6 hours of this game logged. I'd like to let it be known that about 2 hours of that was spent trying to reach 800 chain dashes in the dash shop area. I finally accomplished it. I have no regrets.","April 2","true","24.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Challenging, without being ridiculously hard.\n\nI got this game because it looked very atmospheric and chill in the video. While the game is very beautiful, and has some atmospheric(ness) to it, it's definitely not very chill (which is fine). It can be quite challenging and nerv wrecking at times. The map was not done very well and can cause some headaches sometimes with figuring out where to go. So prepare to explore alot. Also, this game has no text in it. Meaning, no characters talk to you with text (only images) and the upgrades aren't described well. The upgrades not being described well is pretty annoying when you're first getting the hang of the game, but you'll figure it out eventually. All in all, absolutley worth buying. You'll enjoy it, I promise!\n\nPros:\nGreat soundtrack\nVery fun gameplay\nCool graphics\nGreat controls\n\nCons:\nCrashes once ever 2 hours or so\nDifficult to navigate with the map\nUpgrades not explained well","April 11","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Furthermore, the launch was crippled by FPS drops, but it has since been patched out and the game ran without any issues for the duration of my first playthrough.\n\nThe Good:\n+Excellent combat that relies on timing and mastery of the players abilities.\n+Fluid pixel art that is easy on the eyes.\n+Fantastic music by Disasterpiece, the same artist that produced the music for Fez and Shoot Many Robots.\n+Lots of secrets, hidden paths and upgrades hidden around every corner of the map and dungeons.\n+The story and narrative is told without dialogue, much like Journey was, which makes for a different experience.\n+Enviromental puzzles and challenges break up the hack and slash action.\n\nThe Bad:\n-The game has superb boss fights, but could've used more, especially since the last zone featured more than one.\n-Some enemies will knock your character over and hit you again, before you can dodge away, leading to cheap deaths.\n-Due to opting out of dialogue the story does seem somewhat shallow.\n-Secrets fall between just being in a corner or having incredibly obtuse sollutions that aren't always explained.\n\nBottom Line:\nHyper Light Drifter is a love letter to old retro games and flaunts great gameplay, tells a simplistic story and at times, delivers crushing difficulty. For those looking for a retro challenge this is it, however those looking for less action and more pure exploration should look elsewhere.","April 10","true","19.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueMagi/recommended/257850/","BlueMagi","Eibon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueMagi/","423 products in account","Hyper Light Drifter is a game about a world; sure, there’s a lot of fighting and weapons and upgrades (and even a bit of football), but ultimately everything is about the world Heart Machine set out to create. And what a world it winds up being.\n\nYou start off alone, in the mountains, and sick. Hyper Light Drifter is careful to make your sickness apparent, but never let it weigh you down. Immediately, your presence and purpose is set up – an indeterminate time ago, a catastrophe happened, and you’re at ground zero hoping to find a cure. It’s unclear exactly how you’ll find the cure, but the only hope is the technology of a civilization that destroyed itself.\n\nAfter briefly succumbing to illness, the Drifter wakes up in town, and takes their first steps into the unknown. You get scraps of information from the townspeople: someone of the Drifter’s race was mugged on their travels, the mysterious drifter who saved you has a penchant for defending the weak, and the key to finding the cure is in the center of town.\n\nAnd none of these stories are delivered via words – they are presented through carefully, lovingly drawn images of the events. All of the stories you’ll hear are like this: when you enter a new area, you’ll find out about the area boss’ history through visual recollections of their deeds; when you find a secluded survivor, their tragedy is rendered in detail more explicit than text can easily provide; when you run across the other drifter, he simply sketches on your map.\n\nBut these encounters are rare. The world of Hyper Light Drifter is a hostile and uncompromising one, which leaves you without friends or sources of information for most of your journey. To compensate, the world around you is the story. You’ll run across houses and people consumed by crystal, and you’ll see the corpses of giants in the distance that you eventually see up close later. As you go, you start to piece together a rough history of the world just by existing in it. Later, when you find that survivor, it provides just enough clarity to establish a foundation of lore, but doesn’t overwhelm what your imagination can come up with. In the end, how you experience Hyper Light Drifter – and, more importantly, how you perceive Hyper Light Drifter – becomes the narrative.\n\nIt’s also possible to overlook survivors (though they don’t go anywhere, and can be discovered later), which can drastically affect your understanding of the world. The experience of having your own canon superseded by a game is not a common occurrence, but it’s a thrilling experience when pulled off properly. When my Drifter first set out, they were in a hurry to explore: as a player, I wanted to play; as a Drifter, I wanted a cure. As such, I paid little attention to the details around me, and carried out my task and left. When I came back after two more area bosses were defeated, I found the survivor I never spoke to, and all of the details I had overlooked previously were suddenly relevant and ominous.\n\nThis only accounts for the surface, though. One elevator ride down, and you start finding entirely new fragments of lore that help you piece together what happened in this world. You see drifters that were killed – or possibly killed each other – in their quest to retrieve modules; you never learn the cause of their demise. Beyond a new source of narrative nuance, the buried laboratories help teach you one constant truth in Hyper Light Drifter: everything has a secret.\n\nThe Drifter is more than proficient at fighting (though how proficient you, as a player are, is another story), so combat is a way to keep the stakes high while you fulfill your true purpose: exploring. You’ll find fake walls, invisible platforms, and cleverly hidden switches, all which take you to new resources, new story, new items, and new clues.\n\nAnd the best part? You won’t know any of this from the get-go. Even as a player who knew there would be secrets to look for, I overlooked several in the first area I went to. But the second area taught me a bit more about how the world of Hyper Light Drifter works, and by the end of the third, I knew a lot. On return, I found secrets I had easily overlooked – ones that didn’t even take upgraded abilities to reach.\n\nWhich puts Hyper Light Drifter in a really interesting position: it’s Metroidvanian, in a sense, but it rarely gates off areas based on what abilities you have. Rather, Hyper Light Drifter gates off areas based on what you’ve learned about how the world is constructed. There are also gates that require specific areas to be cleared, but you would almost need precognition to find everything in an area your first time through, and that’s what makes exploring so enjoyable.\n\nThis focus on exploration plays brilliantly with how the game presents its narrative, as you are required to explore to the best of your abilities, and encouraged to discover new ways to explore beyond what you’re used to. As such, you naturally run across tons of ponderous scenes, and uncovering well hidden ones feels extra special.\n\nHyper Light Drifter, to me, is a lot of things: it’s Nausica of the Valley of the Wind, but as a game; it seems like a spiritual successor to Bokura no Taiyō; it’s beautiful sprite graphics in an age where sprite graphics are fading away; it’s ambiguous in its narrative in the best possible ways.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a game I’ve known I wanted since 2013 – but it’s also a game I’ve longed to see happen for longer than that.","March 31","true","29.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Built around exploration and combat, with the most detailed bit of the story appearing in the store description. Anything that can be said in the game is shown with scenery, or described in colourful detail by the few NPCs you encounter. About the only time any English is used is in the menus and the tutorial, making it a lot more accessible to people who aren't as confident with their English language skills.\n\nThere's a load of secrets to be found dotted around the world, hidden in such a way that you'll miss them the first or second time, then curse yourself out when you find out how to discover everything. The map's expansive to the point where you can easily forget where that one door you can finally unlock was situated, and trying to find a single item can be maddening if you opt to avoid guides.\n\nThe combat is oodles of fun, being easy to learn and fun to master. Getting a feel for how much damage you can deal before you need to dodge away from enemy attacks makes fighting beasties enjoyable, even against hordes where timing can be difficult to gauge. And if sword-fighting is a questionable prospect, you can take pot-shots at enemies with any of a half-dozen guns you'll find throughout the world. Good luck aiming with a controller, mind - "pot-shot" is about the most accurate you can ask for when seconds spent aiming can allow enemies to take shots back at you, losing you some precious hit-points. Fighting bosses is a barrel of joy with the slash-slash-dodge-dodge gameplay; admittedly, their patterns can be easily sussed out, but their attacks are punishing enough that if you don't learn, you're going to get paddled.\n\nWhilst I've certainly gushed about the game, I'm sure you can infer from the previous paragraphs some of the problems I've had with the game. As well as the other problems, a couple of the minigames found in town demand some pretty ridiculous things out of the player, with one of them giving me flashbacks to Spyro 2 regarding its content and difficulty. There have also been times where I've managed to dash myself into locations I shouldn't be, but considering the teleport system, I'm willing to waive 'em.\n\nThis last point is a minor one, though I have seen a LOT of negativity regarding it in certain locations - the game is programmed to run at 30FPS. I don't know why, and honestly, I don't care, since the game as a whole is rock-solid and easily worth the fifteen quid I put down for it.","April 29","true","18.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think that all games running at 60 fps give us a better experience, versus running at 30fps. That’s not to say 30fps is unplayable, but is a fact.\n-	While playing 90% of the game using my xbox360 controller, I always felt the dashing was easier and more responsive using KB+M. I don’t know if this was due to the 30fps lock or no. But the parts of the game where you need to dash like crazy, where made using KB+M.\n-	Lack of directions plays good for the most part, but can get you frustrated if you stumble into a difficulty spike.\nNow the good:\n-	Art Direction: Oh my god, what a beautiful world, I can’t call this retro style, the only thing retro is the resolution, and everything else is PIXEL ART at its finest!\n-	Music: For the most part simplistic, but setting the tone along the journey.\n-	Combat: Even locked at 30fps, the combat always felt great, with every enemy careful introduced until you starts to face all of them together, and you starts to dance around then, “a dance of dead”.\n-	History: Story without words, only art and context. I ended the game caving for more, needing to know more about this world, how it came to be. But I’m glad with the direction they choose, always leaving me hanging for the next screen.\nI just want to leave a note about exploration: You need to explore to find the secrets, but you always felt imposed to hug every wall, every corner to find then. I think they should have chosen another mechanic for this, leaving a few secretes well hidden, but the rest (the majority) in a way where the scenario hinted us for they existence.\nIf you like to explore a mysterious world and fight like a samurai; and can cope with the 30fps lock, go for it.

It really immerses you into the game and sets the tone for the plot. Second, the combat is simple to learn, yet hard to master. You can swing your sword, and shoot a gun. Eventually, you can pick up upgrades that may require you to dash and swing your sword in quick succession, but that is really all there is to it. The enemies are made to be very challenging, so you will need to play smart and never take uneccessary damage in order to preserve as much life as possible. Finally, there are many secrets in this game, and even times when you need to look for something vital to completing the game, it could be hidden. I don't want to spoil anything, but always pay attention to your surroundings and look around very thoroughly in order to get the best experience you can for this game. Nothing in this game bothered me enough to mention, but everyone is different. A thing to mention is the story is very interesting yet hard to comprehend. You pretty much have to imagine a lot of the sotry for yourself, but there are times when you can piece bits of the intended story together based on environment, bosses, and interacting with NPCs (That do not talk in any other way besides showing you pictures) Essentially, if you are not into the types of games that do not hold your hand and tell you where to go, you will dislike this game. Come into this 7-9 hour game expecting a challenge, because that is what you are going to get. I hope many people come to purchase this game and support the developers that worked very hard on creating a game that is memorable in every aspect.

The backdrops, stages, dungeons and vista's are all stunning, with a vibrant (and somewhat unusual) colour pallette.\n- Tight, fluid combat. With full controller support, the game handles extemely well allowing for swift use of both sword and gun while dashing to avoid enemy attacks.\n- Ambient, electronic soundtrack which swells and crescendo's dynamically depending on the situation.\n- Immersive storytelling, told entirely visually using the environment and various NPC's.\n- Difficult, but forgiving. Deaths rarely feel cheap.\n- Has a control scheme for PS4 controllers! (may not seem like a big deal, but I've been using a DS4 for some time now, seeing very few games have the control scheme available without modding).\n- Steady stream of patches since release to address several bugs.\n\nCon's\n- The lack of direction and assistance may be off putting to some.\n- Hidden and optional areas aren't always obvious (not that they should be), which leads to a certain amount of running into everything hitting Y/Triangle. Could leave a lot of players missing extra upgrade currency/medkits etc..\n- At times, the music can be overbearingly loud, nothing some volume adjustment wont fix, but when it goes quiet again, you'll struggle to hear.\n\nIs it worth the asking price?

It's not an easy game for the most part, but it's fair, satisfying, and rewarding in the end.  Another aspect I really loved was the level design and how carefully crafted and hidden all of the secret areas and collectibles were.  The visuals and audio were also spectacular from the character and enemy animations to the soundtrack composed by Disasterpeace to the effective and crisp SFX.  The story and world were also very ambiguous and fun to try to piece together with a lot of the big setpieces in the game taking to great effect.\n\n(Possible Spoilers ahead) My main and only real issue with the game is how insignicant the collectibles really are, only really amounting to some different looking gear.

This game perfects a method in creating an experience, in telling a story, that goes beyond conventional narration and theme. It does this by both hiding and slowly revealing details at a pace that leaves you always grasping for more, but always satisfied by what you've discovered. While there are no words and the only communication with other characters is through sets of descriptive images of scenes, the player will understand the purpose and meaning of Hyper Light Drifter if they look carefully enough. You have one simple goal in Hyper Light Drifter, explore and uncover powerful artifacts of the past. Your motivation is as simple and deadly as any in the real world, a terminal and mysterious illness. As you explore more and more of the beautifully drawn and animated world of Hyper Light Drifter, you'll discover the dark secrets of the hidden past and why the Drifter is going down this path. The biggest strength of this game might actually be the ambiguity the story telling allows. Similar to games like Journey in this respect, you'll fall in love with Hyper Light Drifter becuase it lets you unravel the mystery of events in the game's universe rather than shouting a plot at you. This gives a special and personal significance to the character of the Drifter and the circumstances that befall him in the player's heart, not because they are told to like the character, but because they discover they do through their own experience controlling him. I DEFINITELY recommend this game, you will fall in love if you appreciate the deep care and effort an artist puts into their work. With the wonder of a Miyazaki film and the depth of a Souls game, Hyper Light Drifter is one of the best games to come out in the last year, and Heart Machine deserves much more credit than what they're already given for creating it.

I would say Hyper Light Drifter is a mix of Fez, Dark Souls, Bastion, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.\n\nPutting that aside, I adore this game despite how much hardship it has put me through.  It's not an easy game for the most part, but it's fair, satisfying, and rewarding in the end.  Another aspect I really loved was the level design and how carefully crafted and hidden all of the secret areas and collectibles were.  The visuals and audio were also spectacular from the character and enemy animations to the soundtrack composed by Disasterpeace to the effective and crisp SFX.  The story and world were also very ambiguous and fun to try to piece together with a lot of the big setpieces in the game taking to great effect.\n\n(Possible Spoilers ahead) My main and only real issue with the game is how insignicant the collectibles really are, only really amounting to some different looking gear.  It makes me wishing it had an impact on the story, the cutscenes, or even just the way the world looks (maybe collecting everything made the game turn to night or something).\n\nAll in all, though, I would wholeheardedly recommend this game.

It's story is one you have to search for, without words the story is told in each setpiece, the environments and the enemies tell a very quiet tale about a broken and unforgiving world. It works the same was as Dark Souls, and while people can argue that Dark Souls also had text to help you along I feel that it is unnecessary in Hyper Light Drifter. You pick up the pieces with each new area or enemy and the story eventually comes together nicely towards the end.\n\nThe combat I found fun and challenging, but it was a bit clunky when it came to learning how to chain-dash or get a combo going. At some points I was able to nail a very fast and fluid combo and the game rewards you heavily for doing so, it just might take a bit too long to get to that point due to the slightly wonky way they have timing for attacks chains. These problems could honestly just be due to the frame rate cap so I'll talk about that next.\n\nA big issue people have with this game is that it is locked at 30fps and has occasional dips in performance. This does have an adverse effect on combat as sometimes the game doesn't register your inputs so your combo doesn't work out. Also drops in performance happened occasionally which made the game feel much more grating especially when it happened during boss battles.\n\nWith these issues in mind I still whole-heartedly recommend this game. Why? Because when it works it works. People seem to take any negative issue a game has and blow it up until it's all a game is known for. It does suck that the game is capped at 30fps and there are drops in framerate at some points but honestly it didn't mean much to me. The artstyle, atmosphere, story, soundtrack, combat were all so on point that I can't even think about not recommending the game because of those issues.\n\nIf you have $15 dollars and you'd like a taste of what a nice pairing between Legend of Zelda and Dark Souls would be like check out this game.","April 20","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

YES\nWorth a buy at full price? YES\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a throwback to titles of old akin to classic Legend of Zelda entries. Though the game looks to be something for the casual gamer, be warned, for it is a difficult game to get the hang of if you haven't been up to speed with titles like Dark Souls or Hotline Miami.\n\nThe story is told in a very cryptic manner, with no hand-holding or guidance whatsoever. There is no text, either: only pictures that you must piece together to truly appreciate the story for what it is. You are a drifter, and you must perish an ancient evil, a creature whose name is Judgement, in order to free your world from darkness. You are sick, however, with a fatal disease lacking a known cure, one you seek to find on your journey.\n\nPros:\n+ Beautifully handcrafted pixel art that draws you into this atmospheric world\n+ An original soundtrack full of mystery that truly sets the tone for the game's setting\n+ A cryptic story that isn't spoonfed, and rewards those who pay attention, explore, and seek further explanation\n+ Thrilling combat, both very difficult and highly rewarding and satifying\n+ An open world, designed with exploration and attention to detail in mind\n+ A non-linear choice in which area to go to in whatever order you decide\n\nCons:\n- The difficulty alone might be enough to sway someone away from this game. If you've no prior experience with games such as dark souls, then I strongly recommend you watch videos or read reviews to find out if this game is really for you\n- On occasion, it may become difficult to know exactly where you should be going to progress through certain areas\n- If you're not one who likes to put work into finding out elements of a story, and prefers to have things spoon-fed to them, then the story element of this game is really not for you\n\nConclusion:\nHyper Light Drifter is a beautifully crafted gem, with thrilling combat mechanics, a mysterious world, and a cryptic story that requires you to put a little work in to fully understand why certain things happen. With that said, the game is surprisingly difficult, so if you're not up for the challenge, steer clear.\n\nScore: 9/10\nWorth a buy at full price?

I've glanced at other peoples reviews, and in general what they say still holds up:\n\n-The gameplay itself is challenging, and if you learn to efficiently dispatch your foes you'll fine there'll be an abundance of health packs.\n\n-Secrets, secrets everywhere. Sniff the walls all day long but honestly I found that to be enjoyable - finding new areas, extra items and tid bits was something I've always liked to do in games anyway (although this game has certainly outdone itself in number of hidden stuff behind seemingly impassible walls - even the secrets have secrets. No, really-).\n\n-Aside from the Monument text that you have to decode (Purely extra stuff - just reveals more about the story, even if the translations themselves are vague) and the text in the game telling you what button does what everything is told to you via pictures and images. Even important story details and objectives. No seriously - I didn't fully realize what that map was in the Guardian Drifters house until I started pulling up the things in the East area, and by then I'd missed two of the gem things needed to open the Boss door. I got frustrated, wasn't sure how to read the map and didn't want to back track (the thing I loathe the most in games) so I looked up someone doing a run through of the East area to see what I missed. It was only then and after I connected the symbols the Guardian had showed me on the map did I realize what I needed to find and why. After that I was fine but it was still very unclear to me at first and disconnected me a bit from the game world itself.\n\nI guess it was also a little disapointing to find out that getting four of those gem triangle things instead of three (the min you need for the Boss of each region) didn't really give you anything new except for a quick rehash of the opening and illness induced nightmares. I don't BELIEVE getting four in each region did anything to affect my end of the game stuff (it certainly didn't seem like it) but there's no real benefit from getting four of them, so any hopes of extra cutscenes, pictures, or interactions that told you something more (or at least something more obvious) were trashed. Bummer.\n\n-Despite that previous combo paragraph, the scenary always drew you back into the mysticality of the enviornment, as long as you were focused on the game and not preoccupied with anything else (stressed? not invested? Hard to take in the story).\n\nAnd to continue off of that note despite me, personally, still liking the game comes one thing that disapointed me more then anything else - lack of concrete... I don't know the word for it but it needs more key points story wise. Letting you know right now if you don't like/care about stories in games this one is still great - gameplays fantastic bosses are fun to fight. Story is still great regardless.. but..\n\nIt's super vague. I mean, so vague to the point where you gotta start making stuff up for even important plot points like the titans in the opening cutscene and the Drifter themselves. Other then what you see blatantly on the screen (and what you can translate outside the game from the Monuments) everything else is a theory. The Dog? Anything you can guess about it or it's origin - theory. Titans? Even calling it a Titan is a theory - could have been Giants, or some other species created by someone else - or not. The game is very open ended in it's ENTIRE story (they give you pieces and you basically build it) and despite it's visual approach the Drifter doesn't react to any of it. You really only get bits of the Drifters personality from how they're animated. Other then that and the cutscenes his personality is very interpretive and... I dunno about you but with games like this I'd like a few more story keys or personal ties from character interactions to draw me into the world a bit more. After that intense opening cutscene, I was kinda sad to find there wasn't much more then that (even the ending one was lacking but at that point I was taking what I could get).\n\nGrant it I haven't found every secret in the game YET but I've been looking around and if you've been in the fandom business for atleast a cycle or two you'd know spoilers are usually one of the first things you see when you're indulging in  lore and fanart and I have yet to be spoiled by anything I might have missed. Haven't heard a lick about it so I just assume it doesn't exist until I find it.\n\n\nIf you wanted a story told TO you this games really bad at that. You really gotta put pieces together to form any sort of picture about the world in your mind and by doing that you get drawn into the world as the Drifter. For all we know they know about as little as you do, so your curiosity, your lack of information is their lack of information.\n\nIf you wanted to dive yourself into a world and examine the pieces this games good at that.\n\nTo get out of the story perspective, though...\n\nGameplay? Amazing. Not too challenging and fun to engage in.\nVisuals? Astounding. There will definitely be sections you'd want to screen cap or stare at for a few minutes at a time - sometimes longer.\nMusic? Atmospheric - most of it is relaxing or dreadful (boss fights). It's very unique to the game itself.\nStory? I still like it but... it's frustrating to me all the same. I wish there was more key points told to you, more definites, more to work off of besides all these loose puzzle pieces that don't easily match up - but the Monuments are the same way, only more obvious..\n\nMaybe the whole stories there like how we can translate the Monuments, I have no idea. Probably. The pictures are puzzle pieces in this race to see what the definite story is - but then they'd all still be theories. I could run this in a rat race all day, but really this game is great. Regardless of whether or not it's on sale I'd recommend it. If you're still unsure, wait until it's on sale. Still a great game, still a good story even if I think it's a bit too open ended; I still liked it.\n\nAnd yeah I realize this is just me kinda being disappointed with lack of concrete story points but I figured I'd add my two cents in where no one else seems to be poking at it. Or at least not as prominently. I might edit this later when I replay it.","May 2","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not impossible, not completely hardcore insane, not even your run-of-the-mill roguelike or bullet hell shooter hard, but it will definitely challenge casual gamers who are looking for a fun and relaxed experience.\n\nAnd what an experience it is. Not quite metroidvania, not quite soulslike, yet drawing from both, this game will see you exploring environments rendered in lovely pixel art, occasionally fighting monsters and doing a little platforming before fighting a boss at the end of each area. Right from the beginning, the game lets you go in three different directions, letting you choose what path to take and which bosses to take on first.\n\nBoth combat and platforming rely heavily on your dash ability, which you have from the start. Many enemies have dash attacks as well, so combat often becomes a wonderful dance of timed dodges and quick counter-attacks, and the first time you finish a large encounter and your enemies lie in pieces at your feet, you will feel like a god!\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game on what little I have played. But like I mentioned earlier, this game is not for everyone. I'd just like lastly elaborate on the difficulty so you know exactly what you are getting into:\n\n- Bosses are VERY aggressive and deal a large amount of damage, and will change their attack patterns over the course of the fight. You will be overrun by adds, and stunlocked while attempting to heal. Your health bar is pitifully small, so sometimes you could go from full health to 0 HP in under a second. You will die. A lot. There are abilities you can buy to complement your arsenal and skills, but apart from the ability to carry an additional medkit, I have yet to find anything that would actually really help you stay alive if you aren't that confident in your abilities in the first place.\n\n- Apart from the bosses, there are a number of occasions when you are locked in a room with a large number of enemies. If you die, you restart at a previous checkpoint, but with the same amount of HP and medkits you had going in, so if you were low on supplies to start with, you might have a lot of trouble. Remember that you can always teleport out to the hub, and go farm some medkits and try again.\n\n- In the style of many oldschool 2d games, secrets in this game sometimes involve a lot of just running up against every wall in the hopes of finding a hidden passage. Sometimes they are well telegraphed, with clues in the environment, but other times it felt like dumb luck. At times this can get quite frustrating.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game. It's just not for everyone. If you like this type of game however, you would do well to check it out.\n\n","March 31","true","19.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's story is one you have to search for, without words the story is told in each setpiece, the environments and the enemies tell a very quiet tale about a broken and unforgiving world. It works the same was as Dark Souls, and while people can argue that Dark Souls also had text to help you along I feel that it is unnecessary in Hyper Light Drifter. You pick up the pieces with each new area or enemy and the story eventually comes together nicely towards the end.\n\nThe combat I found fun and challenging, but it was a bit clunky when it came to learning how to chain-dash or get a combo going. At some points I was able to nail a very fast and fluid combo and the game rewards you heavily for doing so, it just might take a bit too long to get to that point due to the slightly wonky way they have timing for attacks chains. These problems could honestly just be due to the frame rate cap so I'll talk about that next.\n\nA big issue people have with this game is that it is locked at 30fps and has occasional dips in performance. This does have an adverse effect on combat as sometimes the game doesn't register your inputs so your combo doesn't work out. Also drops in performance happened occasionally which made the game feel much more grating especially when it happened during boss battles.\n\nWith these issues in mind I still whole-heartedly recommend this game. Why? Because when it works it works. People seem to take any negative issue a game has and blow it up until it's all a game is known for. It does suck that the game is capped at 30fps and there are drops in framerate at some points but honestly it didn't mean much to me. The artstyle, atmosphere, story, soundtrack, combat were all so on point that I can't even think about not recommending the game because of those issues.\n\nIf you have $15 dollars and you'd like a taste of what a nice pairing between Legend of Zelda and Dark Souls would be like check out this game.","April 20","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smegheneghan/recommended/257850/","smegheneghan","Jakebob-Smegheneghan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smegheneghan/","212 products in account","A really fun game to be had here. Built around exploration and combat, with the most detailed bit of the story appearing in the store description. Anything that can be said in the game is shown with scenery, or described in colourful detail by the few NPCs you encounter. About the only time any English is used is in the menus and the tutorial, making it a lot more accessible to people who aren't as confident with their English language skills.\n\nThere's a load of secrets to be found dotted around the world, hidden in such a way that you'll miss them the first or second time, then curse yourself out when you find out how to discover everything. The map's expansive to the point where you can easily forget where that one door you can finally unlock was situated, and trying to find a single item can be maddening if you opt to avoid guides.\n\nThe combat is oodles of fun, being easy to learn and fun to master. Getting a feel for how much damage you can deal before you need to dodge away from enemy attacks makes fighting beasties enjoyable, even against hordes where timing can be difficult to gauge. And if sword-fighting is a questionable prospect, you can take pot-shots at enemies with any of a half-dozen guns you'll find throughout the world. Good luck aiming with a controller, mind - "pot-shot" is about the most accurate you can ask for when seconds spent aiming can allow enemies to take shots back at you, losing you some precious hit-points. Fighting bosses is a barrel of joy with the slash-slash-dodge-dodge gameplay; admittedly, their patterns can be easily sussed out, but their attacks are punishing enough that if you don't learn, you're going to get paddled.\n\nWhilst I've certainly gushed about the game, I'm sure you can infer from the previous paragraphs some of the problems I've had with the game. As well as the other problems, a couple of the minigames found in town demand some pretty ridiculous things out of the player, with one of them giving me flashbacks to Spyro 2 regarding its content and difficulty. There have also been times where I've managed to dash myself into locations I shouldn't be, but considering the teleport system, I'm willing to waive 'em.\n\nThis last point is a minor one, though I have seen a LOT of negativity regarding it in certain locations - the game is programmed to run at 30FPS. I don't know why, and honestly, I don't care, since the game as a whole is rock-solid and easily worth the fifteen quid I put down for it.","April 29","true","18.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StupidName/recommended/257850/","StupidName","SuperJer [Linux "Hipster"]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StupidName/","453 products in account","This game came as real surprise.  It wasn't on my radar.  I hadn't even heard about it, then the other day it shows up in New Releases.  The trailer hooked me, as it looked like exactly my type of game, and I bought it without hesitation.\n\nNow once I started playing the game, it became clear that it was meant to be quite challenging, and I struggled with it at first.  I'm not terribly good at the sorts of games that list “high difficulty” among their selling points.  The game was still gorgeous, the atmosphere perfect, but I was frustrated by how often I died, and how easily an area with few basic enemies could kill me.  This further upset me, because I really wanted to see the whole game, and at first, it didn't seem like a game I would ultimately enjoy playing through.\n\nIt didn't take me long, however, to start to get into the rhythm of the game.  Muscling my way through an area became very rewarding.  The checkpoint system is forgiving enough that you're never sent back too far, and the maps are FULL of secret areas with just the thing you need when you're getting kicked in the jimmies.  I had upgraded a few things (I started with the health packs.  Don't spend it on them, get sword or dash upgrades first) and was generally clearing most areas on the first or second try.\n\nThen came the first boss fight.  I said, “Hell yeah, I'm up for this!”  Twenty tries later, I was ready to fling my Steam controller through the TV.  I'd barely made a dent in his health.  I was furious, and far more aggravated than I had been hours ago when I first started the game.  I pretty much gave up on ever seeing the end of the game, and I put it down for several days.\n\nIt occurred to me later that there didn't seem to be anything really preventing me from going and exploring other places.  The map is divided into 4 sections (each with its own boss) with the starting city in the middle, and it turns out that at the beginning you can go visit 3 of them.  There doesn't even really seem to be any set order they need to be done in, and you can really complete most of each area without actually beating any of the bosses.\n\nSo now it's on.  I'm exploring every nook and cranny of the map, looking for cards (? whatever the upgrade currency is called) and spending them.  There are so many cleverly hidden (and sometimes beautiful) spots, and finding them is almost reward enough, but they also always contain health packs and/or cards.\n\nThe variety of enemies is very impressive as well.  Most enemies are pretty weak, and go down with just a few slashes, but most of them can jump and move around almost as well as you, and it only takes a few of them to really crank up the challenge.  It's pretty thrilling to find yourself in the middle of an ambush, hopelessly slashing, flinging yourself around dodging and positioning for an advantage, and then coming out by the skin of your teeth.\n\nSo having spent some time honing my play style and upgrading the protagonist, I made my way back to the first boss.  No doubt about it, he was still fairly challenging, but on my first attempt I had taken out a fair bit of his health before dying.  I persevered, and after about 5 more tries (each a little better than the last) I beat him.  Now I'm 37 (I'm not old), and I'm a little ashamed to say I was jumping up and down in my living room like a little kid.\n\nThis was turning out to be among the best gaming experiences I'd had.  I had almost given up more than once, but I think that's what helped give me such a great sense of accomplishment upon returning and completing a given challenge.  I'm real glad I stuck with it through the end.  The setting is amazing, the world is vibrant with life and danger, and the trials and rewards along the way are a near perfect balance.\n\nAside: The issues with difficulty that others are claiming are likely due to the unidirectional way we tend to play our games.  Having trouble with an area or a boss?  Go elsewhere for a while.  It'll still be here when you get back, and you'll be better equipped to handle it next time.\n\nThe developers have also been very involved in the post-launch playtesting.  Not just for fixing bugs, but they've been engaged with us players tweaking and adjusting gameplay and taking our suggestions and concerns to heart with fast-turn-around updates.  They all deserve a major high-five.\n\nEdit:  New Game Plus is not what you think.  It's much harder.","April 19","true","19.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, 2 days later the memories of playing it were still drifting around in my mind and made me conclude it wasn't so bad after all.\n\nIt's a good game overal, offering moderately difficult gameplay with some pretty difficult challenges that unfortunately get trivialized if you are thorough with the game. Being thorough also opens up an additional bad aspect of the game that made it from a solid 9 to a sloppy 8.\n\nThat additional bad aspect is the "needle in the haystack" part near the end of the game where you're retracing your steps through the full game AGAIN with a guide to find every last pickup so you can get that 100% completion. The game unfortunately offers no way to track down the last few of them.\n\nThe other bad aspect is just that it's locked to 30 FPS, which devalues the overal gameplay experience slightly.

I think that all games running at 60 fps give us a better experience, versus running at 30fps. That’s not to say 30fps is unplayable, but is a fact.\n-	While playing 90% of the game using my xbox360 controller, I always felt the dashing was easier and more responsive using KB+M. I don’t know if this was due to the 30fps lock or no. But the parts of the game where you need to dash like crazy, where made using KB+M.\n-	Lack of directions plays good for the most part, but can get you frustrated if you stumble into a difficulty spike.\nNow the good:\n-	Art Direction: Oh my god, what a beautiful world, I can’t call this retro style, the only thing retro is the resolution, and everything else is PIXEL ART at its finest!\n-	Music: For the most part simplistic, but setting the tone along the journey.\n-	Combat: Even locked at 30fps, the combat always felt great, with every enemy careful introduced until you starts to face all of them together, and you starts to dance around then, “a dance of dead”.\n-	History: Story without words, only art and context. I ended the game caving for more, needing to know more about this world, how it came to be. But I’m glad with the direction they choose, always leaving me hanging for the next screen.\nI just want to leave a note about exploration: You need to explore to find the secrets, but you always felt imposed to hug every wall, every corner to find then. I think they should have chosen another mechanic for this, leaving a few secretes well hidden, but the rest (the majority) in a way where the scenario hinted us for they existence.\nIf you like to explore a mysterious world and fight like a samurai; and can cope with the 30fps lock, go for it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueMagi/recommended/257850/","BlueMagi","Eibon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueMagi/","423 products in account","Hyper Light Drifter is a game about a world; sure, there’s a lot of fighting and weapons and upgrades (and even a bit of football), but ultimately everything is about the world Heart Machine set out to create. And what a world it winds up being.\n\nYou start off alone, in the mountains, and sick. Hyper Light Drifter is careful to make your sickness apparent, but never let it weigh you down. Immediately, your presence and purpose is set up – an indeterminate time ago, a catastrophe happened, and you’re at ground zero hoping to find a cure. It’s unclear exactly how you’ll find the cure, but the only hope is the technology of a civilization that destroyed itself.\n\nAfter briefly succumbing to illness, the Drifter wakes up in town, and takes their first steps into the unknown. You get scraps of information from the townspeople: someone of the Drifter’s race was mugged on their travels, the mysterious drifter who saved you has a penchant for defending the weak, and the key to finding the cure is in the center of town.\n\nAnd none of these stories are delivered via words – they are presented through carefully, lovingly drawn images of the events. All of the stories you’ll hear are like this: when you enter a new area, you’ll find out about the area boss’ history through visual recollections of their deeds; when you find a secluded survivor, their tragedy is rendered in detail more explicit than text can easily provide; when you run across the other drifter, he simply sketches on your map.\n\nBut these encounters are rare. The world of Hyper Light Drifter is a hostile and uncompromising one, which leaves you without friends or sources of information for most of your journey. To compensate, the world around you is the story. You’ll run across houses and people consumed by crystal, and you’ll see the corpses of giants in the distance that you eventually see up close later. As you go, you start to piece together a rough history of the world just by existing in it. Later, when you find that survivor, it provides just enough clarity to establish a foundation of lore, but doesn’t overwhelm what your imagination can come up with. In the end, how you experience Hyper Light Drifter – and, more importantly, how you perceive Hyper Light Drifter – becomes the narrative.\n\nIt’s also possible to overlook survivors (though they don’t go anywhere, and can be discovered later), which can drastically affect your understanding of the world. The experience of having your own canon superseded by a game is not a common occurrence, but it’s a thrilling experience when pulled off properly. When my Drifter first set out, they were in a hurry to explore: as a player, I wanted to play; as a Drifter, I wanted a cure. As such, I paid little attention to the details around me, and carried out my task and left. When I came back after two more area bosses were defeated, I found the survivor I never spoke to, and all of the details I had overlooked previously were suddenly relevant and ominous.\n\nThis only accounts for the surface, though. One elevator ride down, and you start finding entirely new fragments of lore that help you piece together what happened in this world. You see drifters that were killed – or possibly killed each other – in their quest to retrieve modules; you never learn the cause of their demise. Beyond a new source of narrative nuance, the buried laboratories help teach you one constant truth in Hyper Light Drifter: everything has a secret.\n\nThe Drifter is more than proficient at fighting (though how proficient you, as a player are, is another story), so combat is a way to keep the stakes high while you fulfill your true purpose: exploring. You’ll find fake walls, invisible platforms, and cleverly hidden switches, all which take you to new resources, new story, new items, and new clues.\n\nAnd the best part? You won’t know any of this from the get-go. Even as a player who knew there would be secrets to look for, I overlooked several in the first area I went to. But the second area taught me a bit more about how the world of Hyper Light Drifter works, and by the end of the third, I knew a lot. On return, I found secrets I had easily overlooked – ones that didn’t even take upgraded abilities to reach.\n\nWhich puts Hyper Light Drifter in a really interesting position: it’s Metroidvanian, in a sense, but it rarely gates off areas based on what abilities you have. Rather, Hyper Light Drifter gates off areas based on what you’ve learned about how the world is constructed. There are also gates that require specific areas to be cleared, but you would almost need precognition to find everything in an area your first time through, and that’s what makes exploring so enjoyable.\n\nThis focus on exploration plays brilliantly with how the game presents its narrative, as you are required to explore to the best of your abilities, and encouraged to discover new ways to explore beyond what you’re used to. As such, you naturally run across tons of ponderous scenes, and uncovering well hidden ones feels extra special.\n\nHyper Light Drifter, to me, is a lot of things: it’s Nausica of the Valley of the Wind, but as a game; it seems like a spiritual successor to Bokura no Taiyō; it’s beautiful sprite graphics in an age where sprite graphics are fading away; it’s ambiguous in its narrative in the best possible ways.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a game I’ve known I wanted since 2013 – but it’s also a game I’ve longed to see happen for longer than that.","March 31","true","29.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Reward stems solely from learning the intricacies of combat. With a few unlockable abilities you are highly mobile, easily able to evade or deflect any incoming attack. But, executing these moves with confidence takes practice and HLD doesn't shy away from punishing you for your errors.\n\nLike the most successful action games, HLD is undeniably cool and stimulating when you fall into its flow. But, this rhythm-harmony is hard to achieve, demanding practice and your undivided attention. Lose it and you'll find yourself completely open to attack or looking at the black death screen -- your colorful sprite lying in a pool of his own blood.\n\nCombat is HLD's most interesting element. You are equipped with a sword that has a single attack combo and a pistol that recharges whenever you attack with the sword. The pistol is just as useful as the sword--even in boss fights--which is an unexpected triumph. Enemies with 2 or 3 hit points can be disposed of with one sword combo, a few pistol shots, or a couple reflected projectiles. Those with more health need a few sword combos and a few shots to take down. But, after completing a single 3-swing combo, your sprite is locked in a sort-of rest animation that leaves you open to attack. Each sword strike has to be timed and enemies never get stunned. Mess up the dash's galloping rhythm and your sprite will slide across the ground for a couple seconds as you helplessly try to regain control. Some guns(yes, there is more than one) have a short cooldown in between shots that can really throw you off if you're not careful. But these moments where, suddenly, combat grinds to halt for a brief couple of seconds really separates it from a generic hack 'n slash requiring little-to-no deliberation.\n\nWith life-threatening challenges around every corner, satisfaction arises from skill-based consistency in battle. This may be a point of issue for some. The nonlinear structure of the game means every area has a similar level of difficulty (excluding the Southern area which isn't immediately accessible). The hardest area will most likely be your first. Although, if you care enough to explore the late game content, there are rooms that will definitely test your skills. But, these rooms always feel extra and are never necessary for progressing through the main game.\n\nHLD presents itself as a very mysterious game and its ambiguity harms more than it helps. NPCs speak in hieroglyphics that resemble symbols you've seen elsewhere. A monitor in your bedroom displays a cryptic diagram. Nothing is explained, save for a few basic controls. After a few hours you will know everything the game has to offer and be left with the matter of finding them. The problem is that you'll think the game has more to offer than it actually does. Much like the NPCs that tell stories in slide-show form, these mysteries are to be seen, not to engage with. They are surface level, solely there to build the world, not to solve.\n\nOn the whole, the ambiguity of its story, characters, and goal prevents HLD from building tension around any particular confrontation or moment. HLD tries to with it short opening cinematic, NPC stories, and one reoccurring nightmare sequence but it's all too little and all too vague. This, coupled with the game's open structure, results in an experience that never escalates to a satisfying conclusion. However, the game has a consistent, dark tone and an atmosphere that is filled with dread. Visually, the game can be dark and frightening as you journey far below the surface. It can be bright and beautiful as you wander through a crystal forest and even epic, with once mobile giants, now forever petrified in stoic backgrounds. HLD combines sci-fi and fantasy in a unique way and it is difficult to not be drawn into its world.\n\nIndividual areas are visually and structurally different, distinctly separate from one another.\nUnlike the game as a whole, each area escalates in the form of sequentially more difficult arena-style battles, climaxing with a boss encounter. Areas will have their own enemy types and combinations, often mixed together in a way that will keep you constantly juggling strategies. Boss fights present proper challenges, spurring the ferocity of combat to new heights in two-phase, lengthy confrontations. Enemy and boss design are both well-done and serve as one of HLD's strongest features.\n\nHLD's biggest problem is its exploration. The map is not really all that helpful. There are three things you're looking for in the game: purple triangles, stone tablets, and keys. Purple triangles are the only items that are mandatory for completion and you only need to find half of them. They are displayed on the map, but are still difficult to find. If you don't want to spend countless hours prowling the world for an item, you won't have to. Finding what is necessary for completion is a fun task that gives you proper time to master the deep combat mechanics. But, if you were looking forward to losing yourself in Hyper Light Drifter intriguing world, trying to piece together an various elusive secrets, I suggest you tailor your expectations.\n\nAfter you have found all the purple triangles, the map is useless. The game doesn't aid in your search for the stone tablets and offers no help finding any of the 16 hidden keys. The environments are riddled with hidden passages, offscreen switches, and invisible platforms. If you are trying to collect everything prepare to run along every wall, every side of every platform, and to dash occasionally off a platform just...because...maybe...\nIt starts to feel tedious. Burn every bush with a red candle.\n\nThe exploration doesn't require any clever use of logic. There are no clues, no puzzles, and really no meaningful reward for end-game exploration. The items you get for finding these secrets are almost always cosmetic. They may boost, for example, the recharge time of your grenades, but nothing you find will alter the way you play the game or the way the game feels. It is a shame that a game with great mechanics fails to offer diversity within them. Only two upgrades, which I acquired quite early in the game, really gave me something new to experiment with, to practice. There is a NG+, where you have 2 hit points and a new outfit. If you are trying to find everything, NG+ is the same exploration with a handicap, but if you are looking for one final test of your combat skills, NG+ will definitely provide it.\n\nIf you are looking for an indie action game to enjoy casually, a game that eases you into concepts and methods and presents an escalating series of challenges up until the end, this might not be the game for you. HLD is almost always a challenge. Even the earliest enemies have the potential to destroy an experienced player. Still, Hyper Light Drifter's atmosphere, world, and combat are all engaging enough to warrant a purchase and worth a good deal of hours spent exploring.","April 8","true","43.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play as the Drifter, and view the world from a bird's eye view. The game world is open and vast, and you must go undertake a quest to save existence. Along the way, you will find better equipment, and currency which you can then use to upgrade your equipment and skills.\n\nThis game is gorgeous. Its art style is very reminiscent of the 8-bit and 16-bit eras of videogames, and it certainly plays like a game from that era. The game is challenging, but not brutally difficult. Combined with the music, it is very easy to get lost inside the world of Hyper Light Drifter. Did I mention that this game is gorgeous?\n\nThe story is vague, and told purely through visuals, as there is no spoken language or written english text in the game. There is a coded language than you can decipher (I believe other players have deciphered it) that offer additional clues about the plot for you to interpret.\n\nThe gameplay is both fast-paced, with peaceful lulls in-between, to explore and find the game's countless hidden secrets.\n\nThis little game is a lot of fun. A must play for anyone that loves action games, pixel-based art, or longs for the old days of NES adventures.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say about this game is that the Steam achievements don't seem to be working properly at the time of this review. However, that's such a minor detail that will probably get fixed, and does not really affect the game itself.\n\nThis game truly is a gem.

It's a bit of a stretch to call Hyper Light Drifter a hack n' slash as there tends to be a lot more strategy to movement that first appearances suggest. With artwork reminiscent of Superbrothers: Sword and Sorcery but combat more akin to Dark souls style of high risk high speed reflex oriented attacks. The minimalist setup of the game only tends to add to the appeal in my humble opinion.   If the game is not challenging enough for you then the New Game+ mode should sate you. The normal play through has you resting at 5 health boxes, with most attacks chipping 1 and a few heavier attacks costing you 2. New Game+ leaves you with 2 health boxes making many previous hits instant death. GLHF!","June 3","true","70.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dojutrek/recommended/257850/","Dojutrek","Dojutrek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dojutrek/","460 products in account","The Good:\nThe music, while mostly forgettable, is well composed and world fitting.\nThe combat is solid and rewards timing attacks versus rushing through.\nThe pixel art on display is gorgeous and vibrant.\nThe Neutral:\n(See Below for reasons)\nThe controls can be cumbersome and rigid, especially the Chain Dash.\nThe Bad:\n(See Below for reasons)\nSome In-game Challenges are heavily stilted against the player.\nKnockdowns are plentiful and, usually, deadly.\nComments:\nI, at first, absolutely despised Hyper Light Drifter (HLD) and I still sort of do in a love-hate kind of way. HLD is an Open-ended Action-Adventure game with lovely pixel graphics, a noticeably decent soundtrack, and aspirations to be a Dark Souls-esque game. However it doesn't really stack up to that last part, with much of the difficulty being attributed to HLD's design and engine limitations, one such example being Knockdowns are everywhere. The animation to get up from a single knockdown is long and non-cancelable, plus you're not invincible while doing so which can lead to tons of deaths from enemies and even the hazards peppered around the world. However, that's nothing compared to the controls being what they are, even on a decent machine.\n\nReally it wasn't the difficulty, the gameplay, or even the style of the game that reinforced my gamer rage; it was the controls. The controls were god aweful when I first picked the game up and even with some of the most basic upgrades they felt stiff. This I can only attribute to the GameMaker engine that they used to create HLD. That doesn't mean the controls didn't grow on me over time, say for the Chain Dash, but in certain situations they still feel this way. It also doesn't help that there are virtually no cancels on actions, which harms the fluid combat already in place. There's no canceling an action to dodge which can lead to getting hit quite frequently earlier in the game, as there's no way to really attack and dodge at the same time. It's really when the two dash attacks are finally obtained HLD's combat becomes bearable and coupled with certain pieces of equipment it becomes actually fun to play.\n\nEven with the controls and the mechanics being issues in places, one thing I cannot accept is the optional challenges for the 100% completion. Two such barriers come to mind when seeking completion of the game, The "800 Consecutive Dash" and some of the 8-Module Area Challenges. The Area Challenges can be brutally annoying to complete, but at least they have alternative methods of getting through them. However, The 800 Consecutive Dash is one of the worst design choices I have encountered in recent memory, as it's painfully dreadful to sit and press the dash key that many times. I attempted it and got to around 500 with a gamepad before I gave up, eventually I installed a hotkey program to actually complete the challenge. This 800 Dash requirement was a painful slog and a terrible means of padding out the game, which in turn harms the completion aspect to the game.\n\nOverall, my recommendation is to play Hyper Light Drifter and love it for what it is, but just don't expect it to love you back. It's not Dark Souls, but Hyper Light Drifter for what it's worth is forged in similar fires with lesser materials.","April 5","true","19.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game delivers on everything from its colorful pixel art style to its atmospheric soundtrack. If you like Zelda: A Link to the Past, Super Metroid, Dark Souls, Fez, Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery EP; or any combination of the above, then you'll love this game.\n\nControls: The controls are pretty easy to pick up on, even without going through any kind of tutorials or having your hand held all the way through the game. This game feels like it's catered toward a gaming fanbase that has played enough games of this style, that it's almost a universal language between what's on screen and what you need to do next. I'm currently using a PS4 controller, so I'm not having any problems, although I've heard people are not having as much luck with Xbox Controlelrs or Keyboard and Mouse setups. The only issues I have are no vibration with a wired controller yet, and when it comes to exploring the world, some leaps are almost impossible unless you are lined up just perfect, so you may end up jumping to your death trying to get to some collectibles (worth it).\n\nMusic: Probably one of the main reasons I bought this game. Disasterpeace will undoubtedly go down as one of the best game composers in the future. He is able to incorporate conditional algorithms with his musical textures so that it builds perfectly as you enter points of action or step into new areas. To see this work seemlessly with an art style this minimal is always refreshing. See Fez if you haven't played it yet. Disasterpeace's composition, arrangement and sound design are about as professional as you may come across for Indie Games.\n\nArt: This game is getting compared to a lot of other games such as Bastion, Transistor, Titan Souls, etc., but I can't help but to also think of Swords and Sworcery EP as this game seems so musically driven as well. The color palette is very interesting for a pixel art style, and the contrast really works to make this game stand out from the rest. The minute animations that go on, such as birds flying, animals walking or swimming around, weather effects, to something as simple as your cape fluttering in the wind in a not so obvious repetitive pattern; really helps to show that years of attention to tiny details is what is making this release something a bit more than just another pixel art style game. I look forward to every new area, and I feel like there's a secret within every room.\n\nDifficulty: This brings me to the next part. Many people are complaining that it's too hard, and this apart from the framerate complaints seems to be most consumers' biggest gripe and fear. I'm not going to claim I'm a great gamer or anything, as I've died probably 50 times or more already within the few hours I've played. I've laughed at myself more than getting angry at the game. The respawn times are not that bad, and better yet, the music is more or less unaffected, so it doesn't kill the mood at all when you do die. You just want to keep right on playing and try again. I didn't find the first boss I fought to be that difficult, as I pretty quickly picked up on its patterns, and played it as safe as I could and healed when necessary.\n\nTips: Save your health packs for only when necessary. It's okay to die in this game, so hold on to them until you really need them. Check every nook and cranny, hug every wall, and check every object that looks suspicious. You will find a lot more gearbits (currency) than you may expect that will help you buy upgrades. Being able to deflect back projectiles or dash through them will help you alot for mini-boss/boss fights, as well as when you get surrounded by a lot of people shooting projectiles at you at once. Don't give up on the game. Just go explore another area, fast teleport to the areas where you can heal for free, and search for gearbits to buy upgrades; then go back to the area you had problems with before and try again. The difficulty of this game is not as hard as many are making it out to be. They are just first day reviewers with little to no patience with their character that probably has no upgrades yet. Be patient and do what the game suggests. "Explore a beautiful, vast and ruined world riddled with dangers and lost technologies." You'll find what you need to help you progress further, just like in any Zelda or Metroid game.\n\nFinal Verdict: I'd be kidding myself if I came to any conclusions before I've had one good full playthrough yet, so I'll come back to edit this later. From the short amount of time I've put into it so far; I highly recommend this release, and I feel like I've already got my money's worth.\n\n8/10 at the very least, and that's if you're a rage quitter.","April 1","true","12.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This might even be my new favorite game.\n\nIt is a challenging game which I have not encountered one of those in a while.\nIt is fast pase and give you little room for error but just enough to plan a way out of a situation.\nYou do not want to go into this game fllailing your weapons around. You must plan and strategize with the move given to you.\n\nThis game is truly a diamond in the rough.\nI'm hooked and I can't stop playing.\n\nThe game is beautiful. The graphics are top tier even though it is a pixel art game. All of the diamond shapes and all of the colors really set up a nice picture. It isn't hard on the eye nor is it dull. It is quaint and mystic. That is the art style.\n\nThe sound effects for this game tie really well for what the game sound represents. The gun firing sound sounds like a plasma pistol and that sound gives you a vivid image of a hightech gun. The sword appropriately sounds like a light saber, although it does not sound entirely like a light saber but it gets the point across and paints a vivd image that you are weilding an energy weapon. The enemy sounds fit the enemies they apply to. It is all surreal sounding.","April 2","true","5.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Additionally, I’ve taken care to keep this review spoiler free.\n\nAt first glance the gameplay is familiar, and is something akin to A Link to the Past. This coupled with the old-timey graphics gives it a nostalgic feel, but HLD is much more than a reskinned Zelda clone. First, the game is challenging and at times down right hard. However difficult, I found the game to be fair. In fact, HLD rewards good planning and practice. For instance, practicing timing drifts/attacks, and making thoughtful use of each firearm will make or break some fights. There were some battles that I was simply overwhelmed the first couple of attempts at them, but after some reflection and planning, I would breeze through what I previously thought to be near impossible.\n\nWhat struck me next was that HLD is an explorers dream come true. The game is packed full of secret areas to uncover. In these areas could be anything: new customs, currency, weapons, or something more mysterious. In fact, the element of mystery and discovery is a major theme in HLD. The story in HLD is not told in a simple spell it out for you sort of manner. Quite the opposite actually.  Instead, you are left to piece together cryptic clues about the broken world your character lives in. Again HLD reward being thoughtful and meticulous. It is entirely possible to traverse the entire game and not understand what is happening.\n\nFinally, the world is perhaps my favorite aspect of HLD. The music and the masterfully crafted zones invoked powerful emotions. At times I felt excitement, wonder, but also sorrow. By the end of the game I felt connected to the world, its inhabitants, and most importantly compelled to uncover its darkest mysteries (an ongoing process for me and many others). Really my only complaint is that of any great gaming experience, the journey while enjoyable is over far too soon.\n\nTLDR: Hyper Light Drift has great music and pixel art, is challenging but fair, and drops you into a mysterious shattered world that begs to be explored end to end.\n","April 13","true","25.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/steviedoors/recommended/257850/","steviedoors","The Guy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/steviedoors/","300 products in account","a Zelda-esque world with the vagueness & mystery of Dark Souls, and the peaceful, ambient atmosphere of Fez. Hyper Light Drifter's vividly imagined, post-apocalyptic sci-fi world is brought to life with some of the best looking pixel-art you could hope to find in a game, and a brilliant ambient soundtrack courtesy of Disasterpiece. The attention to detail on display in each of HLD's 4 areas is astonishing, with all its strange creatures and enemies animated to perfection, and numerous secrets always hidden just out of the corner of the screen. Every inch of game's world seems to provide clues to its lore.\n\nDespite HLD's peaceful appearance, it quickly becomes apparent that the game's combat is brutally unforgiving. It's reminiscent of a top-down, faster-paced Dark Souls. Go into the game with the mindset you would go into a Dark Souls game with, and you'll gradually start to learn enemy patterns, work out how to deal with large groups of enemies, know when to attack and dodge. The more your play improves and the more abilities your character unlocks and upgrades, the more enjoyable and satisfying the combat becomes, as you dash around the screen, reflecting enemy bullets and slicing rockets in half, dodging enemy swipes and responding with your own. The boss battles are also a joy, and represent the steepest challenges of the game. If you are used to the bosses of Dark Souls, of hitting your head against a wall over and over until you learn the boss' patterns and how to deal with them, you will be right in your element here.\n\nThe game can be frustrating at times, but to what extent this hinders your overall enjoyment will depend on what types of games you enjoy playing. If you are willing to face a bit of a challenge in order to immerse yourself in a beautiful game world, you'll love Hyper Light Drifter.\n9.5/10","April 2","true","21.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Murphy's law of f*ckery\n\nActual information:\nImagine a game with the difficulty of darksouls, mixed with the look and "strategic gameplay" of nuclear throne and the micro management of FTL... without pausing the game. This is the most accurate description of the game I could think of.\n\nevery single screen of the game is a masterpiece of its own. the pixelart without outline is something I really enjoy. there are some moments of confusion or not seeing something because of the lack of outlines, but it's rare. The game is HARD. Like... really hard. Me and one of my friends both agreeed on the statement, that this game is harder than darksouls and bloodborne. especially the bossfights. I've been stuck atleast one hour per boss (Edit: New record! 30 mins for the west boss! he was sadly easier than the other ones, that I fought... too bad, I really liked his pictures). The game is hard, but almost never feels unfair... except for the parts where an enemy knocks you into the spikes and the spikes knock you off the cliff and you die instantly...\nThe game is extremly balanced. not in a traditional sense, but more in an "everything is in sync" way, if that makes any sense. Let's look at that statement from a combat perspective: you can swing your sword three times consecutively. an enemy can charge at you and is inactive for a certain amount of time afterwards. that time is just enough time to jump in and do a certain amount of damage. everything works together and everything works smoothly.\nA thing some people will hate and some will love is the absurde ammount of secret areas. It's absolutly insane how much stuff you can find if you look long enough.\nThe game has a very... unique... way of story telling. There is no text. Just pretty pictures. and I have no idea what's going on at any point in time. the pictures are really pretty tho.\nThe music is great too. just wanted to mention that.\n\nNow the big question: Is this worth your money?\n- Yes, if you don't mind dying... a lot. Great gameplay, great music, great looks and a story. what more could you want?\n- No, if you don't enjoy being stuck somewhere for a potentially long time, redoing fights, searching for medpacks or searching for your objectives. Who has time for that anyways?","April 2","true","19.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fourmore/recommended/257850/","fourmore","Four More","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fourmore/","220 products in account","It took me a little over 6 hours to beat Hyper Light Drifter. 6 hours of atmosphere, intrigue, loss, anger, and, ultimately, victory.\n\nFantastic Aesthetic and Sound DesignLet me start off by saying: wow. Without spoilers, the intro definitely sets the stage for the rest of the game. The environments are intricate, with plenty of little details and set pieces to satisfy any eye. This game has some of the best pixel art that I've seen, and its effect on the player is further amplified by the atmospheric music.\n\nChallenging GameplayHyper Light Drifter expands its gameplay in meaningful ways. In this game, "experience" is in the form of fragments, which you find by exploring the map, slaying bosses, and killing certain enemies. Collect enough fragments, and you can upgrade a skill or weapon. My only complaint about this system is that some skills are far more useful than others. If you chose a skill of less use than the Improved Dash or Sword Reflector, you would probably have a much harder time beating some of the crazier, bullet-hell bosses. Regardless, you learn to beat bosses by memorizing their attack patterns, and damn does it feel good getting that last hit/shot in.\n\nWordless Storytelling I'm a huge fan of games that show us, rather than tell us, what's happening in the story. Other than a few text hints that pop up to explain gameplay mechanics, there isn't a single line of dialogue in Hyper Light Drifter. By not having any words, the game nudges you to look at the lovingly-crafted, pixelated environments for answers. But there is also a downside to this approach: even though I beat it, I still don't understand aspects of the story. This might irritate some people, but if you're like me you don't mind if some things are left up to the imagination.\n\nReplayabilityI didn't 100% the game. I did not discover all items, secrets, and nodes (what I call the purple shining diamond thingies). I only picked up one of the little robo companions. Hell, I just found out after-the-fact that there are alternate capes with special bonuses. I definitely think there's more value here, especially since the game's secrets are tucked away pretty neatly. There's even a New Game+, which seems far more challenging since most attacks will kill you in one hit.\n\nIn ConclusionIf you want an awesome, short-but-sweet, challenging experience, I highly recommend Hyper Light Drifter. For those 100%ers out there I think there's plenty here if you want to go beyond the basic requirements for beating the game. Otherwise, to anyone about to buy the game: enjoy the taste of blood in your mouth.","April 7","true","8.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This post apocalyptic neon covered action adventure game developed and published by Heart Machine is a very impressive introduction to the developer. If you're an aspiring video game designer using game maker studio, this is a perfect example of what the software can do.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Very atmospheric game\n- Varied enemies that attack differently and look very different from each other\n- Several upgrades that keep the game interesting\n- Interesting bosses that all have diverse move sets and character design\n- Fantastic sound design and soundtrack\n- Beautiful visuals that are teeming with color and character\n- The combat is incredible and feels amazing, really my main reason for falling for this game.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- Bare minimum options\n- 30 fps locked (C'mon, it's 2016)\n- Cutscene volume obnotiously loud\n- shakey start\n- basically useless map which will further confuse the player.\n\nSome of my additional opinions:\n- The story is very confusing and never explained out in the open its for the player to decipher for themselves. I really like this and I'd rather let the environment and NPC's tell me the story without spoon feeding it to me. (NPC's speak in pictures which also makes it a bit difficult to understand)\n- This game gets really difficult and may not be for everyone\n- I really enjoyed New game + I feel like it changed up the base game more than other New game +'s\n\nConclusion:\nI bought this game for $17 and I do not feel ripped off, not in the slightest. This is a really fun yet challenging game that harkens back to classic video games such as Zelda and Metroid without ripping them off. The game envelopes the player in a world bursting with color and imagination. The combat is fluid and reminds me of dark souls (a game I might add, that has mastered melee combat) Lastly the soundtrack is jaw dropping and further immerses the player into the world of Hyper Light Drifter. This game is not for everyone, if you're ready for a challenging video game with no hand holding buy this game.","April 7","true","11.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A quartet of glyphs held by angular beings activate, one by one. Suddenly their lights give way to an apocalypse. The city seems struck as if by a hurricane, and all it's wonders and horrors, crumble and rot in a matter of seconds. The once blue waters of the valley become as scarlet as they fill with the bodies of millions of dead. A crawling shadowed mass pursues you, it's touch a mark of infection, and looming mortality. There is something that can save you, a luminous crystal. You reach for it, but the shadow snuffs it out and covers you. All goes dark. You awaken to a storm.\n\nWelcome to Hyper Light Drifter.\n\nThis is a game that drips atmosphere from every single one of it's stylized pixels. Atmosphere, mystery, and death.\n\nProfessional reviews I've read tend to give it comparison to franchises like Zelda, or Dark Souls. Zelda, due to it's exploratory dungeon crawler set up. Dark Souls, for it's punishing difficulty. Even the game's lead director, Alex Preston makes mention of Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, as an inspirational source, along with another famous dungeon crawler, Diablo. But from my perspective, Hyper Light mostly pays clear homage to the console gaming golden age of the Eighties and Nineties. As I've played, I've felt the ancestral spirits of other titles like Ninja Gaiden, Mega Man, Robotron, Strider, Contra, and Metroid looking on and nodding a solemn ascent.\n\nHyper Light, like these, is a reflex game. A death game. And if your reflexes are not up to par, if you have a low threshold of patience, and you expect it's world to welcome you and give you a handguided tour to the end credits, Heaven help you. In the wilds and dungeons outside the tranquil town hub, enemies come at you in droves and there is not a single one you will meet that is a pushover. Each one has a pattern of attack that demands study and practice, and just when you think you have that enemy figured out, and take him down, three more just like him take his place, and seconds into THAT fight, eight completely different NEW enemies show up, just for good measure. You've never seen them before, they're faster. Now young Skywalker, you WILL die.\n\nIt takes time and patience to learn how to fight, how to kill, how to live. It takes time to learn what it is you're even supposed to be doing with your life, such as it is, in the game overall.\n\nWhat are you trying to accomplish? Where do you go? The map you earn in the town hub, for example, gives you an idea of where things are, but only in symbols and vauge approximations of distance and location. You refer to the map rather than rely on it. And the assorted menagerie of beings who inhabit that tranquil town hub I mentioned? Most of them won't understand a word you say, and you won't understand them either. This is a genius move on the part of this dev team. You are in a world of visual communication. If there was literacy here, it's long gone, along with the ruined city. Those who you CAN understand, relay their stories entirely in images, and their information may or may not be in service of your vague quest. Even when you speak to the vendors in the hub, who offer new moves, weapons, and upgrades, they aren't giving you a clear picture of how to pay for those upgrades. You have to parse that out through exploring and figuring it out while delving and salvaging in the wilds.\n\nSome professional reviewers seem to fault the developers for choosing to be so cryptic, but they seem to miss the point. The game uses the atmosphere of it's world to relay the story, rather than depend on long tiring dialogues. It uses the environment to remind you over and over again, that you can only truly rely on yourself and your instincts. You are a Drifter after all, cut off from this alien culture you don't understand, trying to solve a mystery. And the only way to solve that mystery is to embrace it, descend into it, and accept the risk of death that comes with exploring it.\n\nHyper Light is an immersive experience, a doorway to another reality, and it is superbly put together. Control of the Drifter in and out of combat is simple and tight, but subtle pros and cons are attached to each part of your arsenal. For example, you can teleport a short distance in any direction you like, at any time. But each "blink" takes the briefest of instances to recover from. In a pitched battle, such an option of movement causes you to feel powerful and vulnerable all at once. Blink with skill and you feel like a god, blink wrong, and you've blinked your last.\n\nThe four world areas that seemlessly connect to the town are menacing, yet beautiful places which beg you to seek out every hidden wall, room, and underground labyrinth. The color paletes used to bring them to life are a delight to the eyes, lulling you into complacency, while warning you of the savagery they contain. A forest of trees with blood red leaves jut into the sky from ground where pale turquoise crystal spires are nestled in grasses of deep blue. Snow capped moutains of black and gray stone tower into the heavens, dead and dying villages of thatch and glowing gem computer boards hanging off their cliff faces like nests.\n\nThe sound design joins with the colors and leaves you in awe. Dungeons hum, with the thrums of forgotten computers and generators the size of skyscrapers rattling your subwooffer, wind moans through those snowcapped black mountain peaks and whipsers threateningly through those scarlet trees.  A seemingly endless and ethereal electronica soundtrack rounds out the package, ebbing and flowing over you like a tide. It grows in intensity the closer you come to a turning point, discovery, or conflict and changes subtly with each area explored.\n\nHyper Light Difter is indeed a game of atmosphere, mystery, death. It takes time to get to know, patience to learn, and it will not coddle you in any way. But it is also a game of life. It asks you to breathe and observe and contemplate and act. Like life it also takes time to know, patience to learn, and will not coddle you in any way, but not because it doesn't have confidence in you. Life is not easy, Hyper Light Drifter is not easy, but both are beautiful and worth exploring, even with the pain inherent in the process. HeartMachine has created a masterpiece of a game with a genuine soul. I am honored to play it, and while it makes me throw the controller down quite often, I continue to give it a chance and accept it as it is. I hope that many others will as well.","April 2","true","16.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordWeh/recommended/257850/","LordWeh","Lord Weh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordWeh/","344 products in account","I backed Hyper Light Drifter on Kickstarter for $40, which got me a copy of the game on launch, a giftable copy for a friend, and a copy of the digital soundtrack and digital art book.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a blend of its peers that seemingly inspired it; Studio Ghibli, Akira, Diablo, Legend of Zelda, Dark Souls. This is evident from the beautiful opening animation that stylishly hints at a greater world, one that seems to have been fractured by some nebulous but terrible event, beautiful but broken and now tainted by a spreading darkness. Atmospheric music and sound and wonderful pixel-art work together to create a hand-crafted and gentle neon apocalypse tinged with grittiness.\n\nAfter a short intro sequence that sets the scene and provides some minimal tutorial, you are off into the world. There are dungeons to go into, bosses to defeat, weapons to upgrade, secrets to find. It's part Diablo and Legend of Zelda in terms of moment-to-moment gameplay, by way of Dark Souls in terms of storytelling and difficulty. This is a difficult game. But don't let that put you off. When you die you respawn at the last checkpoint (they are numerous, at a minimum once per 'area transition', but often more frequent). The challenge comes in trying to learn the enemies, how they move, what they do, and then deal with them with a minimum loss of resources. The bosses, all of which I found fun, are actual credible challenges requiring multiple attempts. They require you to learn their moves and timings, to vary your tactics, to try again and again, learning a little more each time until you can get them. And you will get them, eventually. They each took me about 20 - 60 attempts, some taking a couple of hours to master. On one I had to go away, thinking that returning later with new items and unlocks would help, but ultimately it was all about learning, timing, and trying again.\n\nI completed the game in about 20 hours, which included a lot of travelling off the beaten path looking for secrets. The game is divided into three 'regions', and a fourth that unlocks once the other three are complete. In these regions you have several 'dungeons', partly linear but with multiple entrances and routes through the regions, it always feels like there is a lot to explore. You'll get lost, you'll go in circles, you'll find dead-ends and eventually begin to figure out the layout and what the requirements are for advancing in each area, you'll discover secrets... I was immersed in this cycle of exploration, discovery, challenge and story. I've seen some people say they've completed the game in about 6 - 7 hours, I can only assume they are much, much better at the boss fights than me, and likely made a dash for the finish line and ignored most hidden areas and side content.\n\nIn terms of story, whilst it is by no means groundbreaking, it is well told and does a good job of immersing you in the world of Hyper Light Drifter. I loved it, it is understated and subtle and slow, hinted at rather than told outright. Ruins, bodies, glimpsed vistas, flashbacks and so-on will drip-feed you the context-delivered story. There is no dialogue, no text to read, you discover it all through images and discovering scenes and putting pieces together. Each region has its own story thread, that ties into the piece as a whole, and you discover some context through finding survivors and other wandering adventurers who offer a glimpse of context through some pixel-art still scenes of their experiences. At the end of it all, I'm not 100% certain I understood what transpired, but I have an idea, the essence of the story pulled me into it and immersed me, I was going with the broader strokes and the finer details seemed unimportant come the final showdown.","April 3","true","19.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

A few of its influences are clear from the get-go, such as the top down Zelda games, and having played through it, even recent games such as Bloodborne came to mind. That said it is still its own thing, with its own strong identity. This is helped by the brilliant art direction and pixel art animation, which is hard to fault. Disasterpeace’s soundtrack is moody, atmospheric and just plain gorgeous. The goal of the game is to activate the four pillars located in the Northern, Western, Eastern, and Southern areas.\n\nThe game could best be described as action adventure, with a heavy emphasis on combat. You start the game with a sword and pistol, as well as the ability to dash. Using the combination of these three tools is key to progressing through the game.  The combat can be fast at times, although in some trickier areas a slow approach may be advisable. The enemies are well varied, with some being particularly aggressive. Most of these feel challenging and yet fair, although a certain plant enemy did aggravate me especially with its hard-hitting attacks. Often you may need to switch up the way you face the larger enemies, and it helps the combat from becoming too repetitive.\n\nYou will find various other weapons throughout the game, and also purchase new abilities or upgrades. In the main hub area you can find a selection of shops to do so, and deciding what to spend your currency on can be difficult in itself. Unlike many games such as the Zelda series, the currency is a rare resource, with 4 small ‘blocks’ being used to make a big one. The big ones are then used to purchase new gear. These blocks are found hidden among the environment, or after defeating certain enemies and bosses. If you find an area or boss too difficult, you may want to search these out as the upgrades can help tremendously in the long run.\n\nExploration is another big aspect of the game. From the outset, you have access to three of four main areas - each having a unique look and feel. These are linked to underground areas, which are filled with hidden paths and secrets. Finding the majority of these hidden paths isn’t required to complete the game, but there are still some you may need to find to progress. This brings me to the map, which I feel could have done with a little improvement, since it can be a little dubious at times. A marker system, similar to the one found in Axiom Verge, could have been a great addition especially when looking for a particular item or place. Of all the areas, I found the eastern area to be particularly confusing when going back to search for secrets.\n\nThe boss battles are by far the biggest challenge in the game. The bosses guard the pillars at the end of the areas, and, as in games such as Dark Souls, can be as frustrating to fight as they are rewarding to defeat. Each will test your skills, in both dodging and attacking. Again the variety here is great, with each presenting a different process to defeat them. And well done Heart Machine to making retrying so painless; if you die in an area you start the area again with exactly what you entered it with. This makes it easy to get straight back into the action, and I feel a lot of modern games could learn from this (although loading times can’t be helped in games sometimes, but that’s another discussion in itself.)\n\nMusic and sound design are excellent; from the more ambient sound to the more upbeat tracks everything suits the design of the game. The sounds are great, such as the satisfying noise from your sword swings or the little beeps your companion makes, nothing felt out of place. Overall both music and sound only enriched the game experience.\n\nHaving taken around 16 hours to complete Hyper Light Drifter I’m extremely satisfied with the game, and yet I also want to go and play more, to discover all the hidden secrets I’m yet to find. Far from an easy game, it may put a few people off, but bear with it and you’ve got an excellent adventure. I found the game as compelling as it was addictive. While there have been a few bumps in the release, Alex Preston and his team has delivered a quality video game, one that I hope many others will play and enjoy. Their hard work and dedication should be recognized with such a well-crafted game.\n\nI can’t wait for whatever is next.","April 4","true","18.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Classic NES gameplay action. Intellectually satisfying. Ambient, beautiful music which never gets tired and always adds to the dark atmosphere. Text-free storyline and sub-plots. Easily some of the best pixel art ever to grace a video game. Possibly my favorite animation since Jordan Mechner's original Prince of Persia.\n\nCriticism of this game has been confined to difficulty. These gripes are legit if you're too young to have played 80s-90s classics like the first Castlevania games, games which were challenging on a level that makes Skyrim and Fallout look embarrassing by comparison. This game is not a walk in the park. You should not buy it for the pretty pictures alone. Expect to *play* this game. You'll need skills and brains.\n\nAs for critics saying, "First boss is impossible, I quit --" this mentality is a lot like, "Great Expectations was an excellent novel until it got too hard for me to read."\n\nZelda's overworld + Metroidvania game motifs + art for miles + thought-provoking puzzles + evocative storytelling = indie GotY.\n\nGet a copy. Don't even wait for Steam sales or Humble Bundles (which may not happen). This game is *easily* worth 20 USD. If you liked the original Zelda for NES, Castlevania IV -- Symphony of the Night, and/or Super Metroid on SNES, then this should be one of the best games you've played in a long time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skampus/recommended/257850/","Skampus","Skampus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skampus/","87 products in account","Hyper light drifter is a 2d platformer that is a mix of action, adventure and dungeon crawling. It's a game about a person (Let's just call him/her Drifter) that's on a journey through an old land of corpses, mutants and lost technologies. The game has solid controls (Controller recommended). They are always tight and responsive, although sometimes I feels as if they may be off, but I probably just suck. The game is already great, and that's shown even more with the beautiful soundtrack and stunning 8 bit visuals. Just looking at it, not even playing it, you can tell that Heart Machine really poured their love for gaming into this masterful  piece.\n\nSince the game has very responsive controls, it has a high difficulty. At many times, it felt unbeatable. But that just makes the emotional reward and love so much better and "Oh so sweet" when you pass a trial. The combat has quite a bit of strategy from what I can tell. Drifter can attack 3 times before he/she gets winded. This is critical in fights because you have to know when and when not to attack an enemy. Successfully hitting an enemy fills up your gun gauge. This of course allows you to shoot. You can also bust random junk around the world to fill it up, making you think about and look for objects to smash. Drifter can also dash to dodge and move from platform to platform. Be aware though, the dash cannot faze through bullets. I learned this the hard way. It's better to use it to zip from cover to cover when swarmed with enemies.\n\nThe dialogue of this game is nonexistent, but clever. Characters never speak, but tell stories in pictures. It gives you a clue as to what they've done or are going to do. I feel this really immerses me alot more than speaking, because the speaking wouldn't fit this kind of game. I feel too as if it goes perfectly with the music score.\n\nIf you're interested in a game that's challenging, visually stunning, beautifully crafted and immersive, than give this a go.\n\nI highly recommend it 10/10","April 6","true","41.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The aesthetics are beautiful, but you'll become frustrated by the horribly designed map and UI. The combat is gorgeously fun, but you'll hit a few brick walls in the form of highly difficult enemy group compositions and bosses. The story is lovely in its simplicity, but baffling in its vagueness. It's a battle you'll face between eliciting ooo's at the beauty and AHHH's at the frustrations. What HLD manages to achieve, much how the Soulsborne games have, is balance the difficulty well and make the gameplay so fun that you're willing to throw yourself against the fray again and again just so you have an excuse to play more, and hopefully progress.\n\nStory\nThe story is deceptively simple. What it tells you is just enough to convince you that your hero has motivation to progress in their quest, but withholds enough to leave something to be discovered. There's a detachment between you and the character. The character clearly knows more than you do, but has no means or reason to explain it all to you. Even the information you get from NPCs is not spelled out for you, literally. The denizens of this world all speak in grunts and clicks, but their words are displayed for you in the form of pictures. This kind of story telling is a brilliant way to convey information and one I've always admired.\n\nThe lack of a language (aside from the monoliths, whose unique language is there for something for devout players to decode to get extra information) is also a problem for the player as much as it is a refreshing take. Maps and inventory management is all wordless, and littered with overdesign. The map is virtually useless and will never tell you where you are exactly, just a very general location.\n\nThe story doesn't really unfold through your actions. Every major step toward the end goal is just another chance for the game to bombard you with the same few scenes that you saw at the start, all of which detail either the future or events that have shaped your hero's motivations. Instead, you're expected to infer the story through your environment and the few interactions you have with other characters. Soulsborne does this much in the same way, but it has the added benefit of item descriptions to lay down some more connecting fibers. In any case, you can either play through the game and form your own hypothesis about the story or read forums, subreddits, and watch summary videos.\n\nGameplay\nI mentioned before that this game is beautiful and frustrating, and that the beautiful gameplay helps to push you to want to overcome the frustrating difficulty. The game is all about its fast and fluid combat, peppered with some exploration and secret finding. Both combat and exploration are equally rewarding and enticing, calling you to tackle both with the same measure of dedication over how simply they are founded by complex they are in their execution.\n\nYour first task in HLD is to explore. You pick a path of one of three cardinal directions and set out on your journey to that quadrant's unique ecology. The first few zones, broken up by a fade-to-black transition, are peaceful, serene. The monsters do not live directly on the outskirts of the centralized city. This allows you to familiarize yourself with the environment, and also find a few secrets.\n\nSecrets are found either by running along the walls and finding a hidden alcove or finding invisible platforms to dash onto and find a nearby island of goodies. Once you understand this is how all secrets are hidden, you'll be running along the outskirts of every zone you find. Yet, the secrets are so plentiful that this never feels tedious or unrewarding. They offer resources that are sparse and you are happy to receive them.\n\nThe other half of the gameplay is combat, which is split into thirds: dashing, slashing, and shooting. Movement in combat depends on your dashing between enemies, either to escape or to close the gap and strike. Dashing is fixed to three quick dashes and a short recovery before you can execute those three again. Slashing is much of the same, where you are allowed three quick hits with your sword before having a second to recharge. Shooting is to be used to take out far off enemies that are too dangerous to approach directly or if you want to destroy those last few pips of their health, safely.\n\nObviously, combat is designed very simply. Even the upgrades are few as to not over complicate the process. However, enemies are smart, and many have moves that can take out almost half your health in a single attack. Some will trap you in a pattern and kill you without you realizing what happened. Each enemy has their own tactics and its up to you to figure those out and exploit the weakness in them. Does an enemy dash at you to attack? Bait them into readying their dash, and then dash before they hit you, then close the gap and hit them while they're recharging.\n\nBosses operate on the same rules, just turned up to 11. In typical boss fashion, they are faster, stronger, and have far more health than their minions. Still, if you remember the principles of learning the pattern and exploiting the weakness, they can be taken down just like any other enemy. Again the Soulsborne comparison is made. Bosses are tough, but they rarely feel so difficult that you want to quit the game for being unfair (there's only one boss that I felt was overly difficult, the Western boss).\n\nAudio/Visual\nVisually this game is a treasure. It reminds us that pixel graphics is one of the most beautiful video game art styles to date. Other indie devs need to take note and remember that pixels should not just be a cheap and easy fallback for when graphics are too hard to do for their game. Everything in this game's environment is loaded with so much obvious passion and talent for the craft. On more than one occasion I had to stop and admire the vistas of overgrown ruins and the corpses of giants. Too often a game is judged on a screenshot, thereby stripping away so many of the elements that make it work as a whole and painting an unfair portrait of the game. However, with HLD, the visuals are so strong that a screenshot alone could convince someone to play the game without knowing another detail.\n\nMusically...the game kind of falls flat. The opening track is a haunting, synth-laden, and mesmerizing piece that really got me excited to hear more of what the game would give me, audio-wise. However, all the music after that is very bland, repeating itself after only a few seconds, over and over. The music is dreary, uninteresting, and doesn't help to motivate me or paint a good picture of what the world is like. Thankfully the visual art is there to pick up the slack and then some.\n\nConclusion\nHLD is a work of passion and vision, first and foremost. It's a game that takes simple elements and makes them seem gigantic with how they are utilized. A basic combat system feels engaging, overwhelming, and exciting to master. The rudimentary art style of pixilated graphics is expertly utilized to create stunning and shocking environments and monsters. Exploration, as a concept, is limited in its components but never feels hollow, and is instead an enjoyable experience. The story, while vague, gives you just enough to get you started and leaves the rest scattered about the game world for you to discover.\n\nStill, it's not perfect, and in its quest of "the beauty of simplicity," HLD forgets some necessary elements. The story isn't developed enough, and the music feels uninspired and redundant. More puzzles would have been nice, and exploration, while fun, could have done with more ways to be conducted. I fully expect people to say $20 is too much for a 5-7 hour game, but assigning a monetary value to hours of content rather than the quality of content itself can only do a disservice to those nay-sayers.","April 6","true","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I will regard it as one of my dream games.\n\nI can go on about the breathtaking pixel artstyle and excellent sound design... but I will choose not to as you already can get the hint from the trailers and other users.\n\nWhat I will be describing here is my personal unbiased experience of the gameplay.\n\nPROS:\n\n1) Fluid and Responsive combat: that requires the right timing in order to overcome your enemies. Every enemy has a window of oppurtunity to strike them hard including the super challenging bosses. Resulting in a deadly dance of death as you drift around the battle field slashing your enemies before they can strke you and drifting away at just the right moment. Rarely have I played a combat so satisfying, easy to learn and hard to master.\n\n2) Bosses: seldom have I faced challenge in recent past when a game threw me a boss. Reminded me of the goold old days when overcoming a boss felt like a real achievement to show off. Every boss fight is unique and memorable!\n\nThose negative reviews that you have been reading about super hard bosses is only a complaint of people who didn't try enough. Personally it took me around 10 tries for each boss to beat (including the last one). I am not a super pro at games and consider myself average.\n\nThe key is knowing your enemy and timing your attacks and using your upgraded abilities by thinking on your feet. It is NOT unfair. Bosses are supposed to be super hard. Deal with it.\n\n3) Exploration: The world of HLD is brimming with secrets galore... every nook and cranny can lead to a secret pathway containing rare gold artifact that you can use to buy upgrades for your arsenal.\n\n4) Enemy Variety: Every region has seprate enemy units, behaviour and asthetics. Never did the game become boring slash and hack button smasher as every new enemy makes you think on your feet to deal with.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n1) Short: yes you might argue good things come in small packages but yes I believe they could have expanded each region further and add more sidequests than the overarching quest you already have. More dugeons would have helped feel the RPG and exploration aspect too. However they chose to focus and make this game purely action oriented. A lost oppurtunity if you ask me.\n\nThe intense actions sequences could have been more paced out with longer gameplay and the loot collection meta game could have breathed more space with more environments and dungeons.\n\n2) Upgrades: Though each sword and dash upgrade is unique and useful in their own way, I felt guns could have  been added with more interesting modules and addons such that modifies the shot pattern or bullets. They could have hidden these modules in secret places to make things more interesting... instead of plain upgrades to magazine.\n\nBastion is a fine example of how to enhance gameplay by adding tactical addons to your existing arsenal. I felt HLD creators lost a lot of oppurtunity here in that regard.\n\n3) Lack of Adventure: You already have all the map revealed to you in the very beginning of the game. I felt it kind of personally took away the wonder and adventure of the game which is based on exploration. Yes the map is abstract, yes you dont know the terrain or the enemy positions of the regions before you visit them, and yet I felt kind of put off by it.\n\n4) No proper quest system: Except your main quest you never encounter any NPCs giving you sidequests of clearing dungeouns / discovering hidden artifacts in lost temples. This serously kind of bummed me as I expected it to be an Action-Adventure-RPG instead they focused it on Action-RPG.\n\nThis could have elivated the game to an altogether different level. Side quests could have been equally cryptic in nature I wouldn't have mind that.\n\nThe game therefore feels a LONG fetch quest for your main questline.\n\n\nRECOMMENDED If you like intense action RPG with a challenging gameplay and breathtaking art and sound production. HLD is one of those rare gems that comes out once a while.\n\nIt has its shortcomings only because they could have made this into a even bigger and better masterpiece of a game than what it already is.\n\nRating (if that matters): 8.5/10","April 4","true","23.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Played two hours of actual game so far with the other seven being the Preview Build.\n\nSo far, I have to say that the combat is great and requires you to think rather than just mash the button over and over to defeat enemies, there is a variety of things to purchase and unlock with the golden things you find through the world that make your character and weapons better, the soundtrack is great and probably my favorite from Disasterpeace, the intro cutscene was amazing from the looks to the music and forboding feel, there are many things to find and collect in the world along with many hidden areas that are sure to give the dedicated of explorers many smiles during their playtime, I like the game having no text to read from characters and such-all dialogue is done through pictures when you talk to a character, them basically showing you what they are trying to say which gives the player the feel of piecing the story together and wondering what has happened to these characters, the game plays wonderful on a controller-I dont understand at all people complaining about the dashing or the combat in the slightest because every feels very tight and crisp, the visuals are great with a varied color pallete that is distinct for each of the four main lands of the game, enemies are varied in my opinion and all look great and have somewhat different behaviors, and lastly the animation on everything in the world and distinctness between every character you see and meet is rather nice and makes you feel like these people are making do in a world with dangers all around this city.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone that enjoys rpgs in the veign of Link to the Past and the challenge and patience of Dark Souls style combat.\n\nPart 2 - 17.5 hours full release completion\n\nBasically all the stuff I said in the first review along with some extras. All the bosses were interesting and having some level of strategy to them with the things that made each of them unique from one another. The use of upgrades for both your weapons and your dash ability is super satisfying, killing the final boss with six of his projectiles reflected back at him was awesome. I personally enjoyed the story being told only through images, cinematics, and the areas instead of text like most other games. Each area was unique in design and asthetic and had some sort of backstory you could learn from the npc you can talk to in each area. As you play the game you are likely to grow attached to the other drifter you meet in each area and feel terrible and it is your duty to avenge him when he eventually dies. The six different guns in the game are, well, different from one another and call all be used to take on a situation differently whether you want to snipe at a distance, shotgun up close, or use a pistol as a utility between sword attacks. Half of the people in the forums are great people and have come together to find many interesting secrets, help one another, and even translate the igname language. The other half cant stop complaining about 30fps which doesnt bother everyone in the world and some people mentioned in the Special Thanks part of the credits (btw, the ST part of the credits is nearly always pooled from all the devs in any production, meaning that the ideals and thanks of one can completely conflict with the ideals and thanks of the others. It's like we're all human or something). All the different equipment sets provide you many different passive abilities that provide some extra replayability and thought when going into a boss fight or an area for the first time. Personally, my current favorite build is BlueWhite for my companion, Pink sword, and White cloak. There's also alot of collectibles for anyone that likes to get everything out of a game.\n\nOverall, this game was a great 17.5 hour adventure rpg (nearly 100%) with great combat, visuals, soundtrack, and an interesting story with a bitter-sweet ending. I recommend it to anyone in need of a fun game that requires you to think and recommends searching every nook and cranny.","March 31","true","35.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm not an animator, but as someone who creates from animated source material, I appreciate the attention to detail on visuals, which match that of games developed on a scale larger than even its own. The omission of any text from NPC interactions, and even the skill tree, recalls the minuscule nature of Journey, resulting in an experience that transcends spoken languages. The soundtrack is good.

It's still a recommendation, but only barely.\n\nThe gameplay is solid. It's part Dark Souls, part 2D Zelda, part Metroidvania. You run around and slash up baddies, collect some guns and fight huge bosses. Basically what you expect from a 2D exploration game.\n\nEverything else though...it's hard to pinpoint what exactly is wrong, but I'll give it a shot. The game is very minimalist and this was done so by choice. There is no real story, no interaction with NPCs other than watching a few pictures, and the map is god awful. You will get lost just because the map says you're somewhere you're not. At that point, just remove the map altogether please.\n\nThe fact that it's an "open world" game does not make a lot of sense to me either. Here's why.\nFrom the starting point, you can go in 3 directions and buy sword, dash, health and gun upgrades with your funds. These directions and upgrades are not at all similar in terms of difficulty and knowing which way to go and which upgrade to purchase is almost crucial to make the later parts of the game easier to handle. Yes, we could argue that placing the items and areas in a set order would make it a lot more similar to traditional Metroidvania style games, but those games are good for a reason. Now, some new players will turn away from this game with a bad taste in their mouth because they didn't go the right direction or buy the right upgrades and were overwhelmed.\n\nOnce you figure out you can in fact go those three directions right from the get-go and buy the double dash and the dash that blocks bullets, the game becomes pretty interesting. Finding strategies for all the enemies and bosses is actually pretty fun, and the devs made sure that even the normal enemies can be challenging. The areas look pretty good, too. The game expresses its own art style, which is hard to do in a world with thousands of indie games per day that are very similar.\n\nThere are 4 major bosses and a final boss, and each area takes a couple of hours at most. The game is not very long in that regard, but there are a ton of optional secrets you can find. I would go back to find all these secrets, but the fact that the map is not at all helpful in any way kinda turns me away from this. To clarify: the secrets are usually hidden by a wall that looks exactly like a normal wall, so you'll find yourself derping into every single wall in hopes of finding them. I'm not particularly looking forward to doing this when there's no map to tell me I've already been there.\n\nWhat I'd really like to see is a patch that includes an actually useful map. Also, make the double dash and protective dash the first upgrades that you have to buy before you can buy anything else. That way, new players can't go wrong anymore and everyone can enjoy the game for what it is.\n","April 8","true","8.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

HLD is one of the first games in a while that feels like I'm developing a unique skillset through playing it. So many games now rely on artificial progression systems in the form of rising statistics to add that feeling. There are unlocks in this game, but I'm the one getting better at playing it, not just my character. The different abilities complement each other well once you learn to use them.\n\nHLD might be one of those games that could be great to come into knowing nothing about it. On the other hand, I've found that knowing about the lead developer's heart condition has changed how I see the game in interesting ways. You're free to see what you want in the imagery. But what I've seen so far is a story about a character with a terminal illness, wandering a dying world in search of something. And the quality of the art and sound really helps to sell the gravitas of that story.\n\nBe warned that the game is not easy. Some of the bosses are very difficult, in my opinion. But the game is open enough that you can always come back to an area later if you get stuck. There is a lot to explore, and the game rewards you for doing so. There are many times when you may have more options than you think.","April 13","true","15.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a game about a person (Let's just call him/her Drifter) that's on a journey through an old land of corpses, mutants and lost technologies. The game has solid controls (Controller recommended). They are always tight and responsive, although sometimes I feels as if they may be off, but I probably just suck. The game is already great, and that's shown even more with the beautiful soundtrack and stunning 8 bit visuals. Just looking at it, not even playing it, you can tell that Heart Machine really poured their love for gaming into this masterful  piece.\n\nSince the game has very responsive controls, it has a high difficulty. At many times, it felt unbeatable. But that just makes the emotional reward and love so much better and "Oh so sweet" when you pass a trial. The combat has quite a bit of strategy from what I can tell. Drifter can attack 3 times before he/she gets winded. This is critical in fights because you have to know when and when not to attack an enemy. Successfully hitting an enemy fills up your gun gauge. This of course allows you to shoot. You can also bust random junk around the world to fill it up, making you think about and look for objects to smash. Drifter can also dash to dodge and move from platform to platform. Be aware though, the dash cannot faze through bullets. I learned this the hard way. It's better to use it to zip from cover to cover when swarmed with enemies.\n\nThe dialogue of this game is nonexistent, but clever. Characters never speak, but tell stories in pictures. It gives you a clue as to what they've done or are going to do. I feel this really immerses me alot more than speaking, because the speaking wouldn't fit this kind of game. I feel too as if it goes perfectly with the music score.\n\nIf you're interested in a game that's challenging, visually stunning, beautifully crafted and immersive, than give this a go.\n\nI highly recommend it 10/10","April 6","true","41.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The aesthetics are beautiful, but you'll become frustrated by the horribly designed map and UI. The combat is gorgeously fun, but you'll hit a few brick walls in the form of highly difficult enemy group compositions and bosses. The story is lovely in its simplicity, but baffling in its vagueness. It's a battle you'll face between eliciting ooo's at the beauty and AHHH's at the frustrations. What HLD manages to achieve, much how the Soulsborne games have, is balance the difficulty well and make the gameplay so fun that you're willing to throw yourself against the fray again and again just so you have an excuse to play more, and hopefully progress.\n\nStory\nThe story is deceptively simple. What it tells you is just enough to convince you that your hero has motivation to progress in their quest, but withholds enough to leave something to be discovered. There's a detachment between you and the character. The character clearly knows more than you do, but has no means or reason to explain it all to you. Even the information you get from NPCs is not spelled out for you, literally. The denizens of this world all speak in grunts and clicks, but their words are displayed for you in the form of pictures. This kind of story telling is a brilliant way to convey information and one I've always admired.\n\nThe lack of a language (aside from the monoliths, whose unique language is there for something for devout players to decode to get extra information) is also a problem for the player as much as it is a refreshing take. Maps and inventory management is all wordless, and littered with overdesign. The map is virtually useless and will never tell you where you are exactly, just a very general location.\n\nThe story doesn't really unfold through your actions. Every major step toward the end goal is just another chance for the game to bombard you with the same few scenes that you saw at the start, all of which detail either the future or events that have shaped your hero's motivations. Instead, you're expected to infer the story through your environment and the few interactions you have with other characters. Soulsborne does this much in the same way, but it has the added benefit of item descriptions to lay down some more connecting fibers. In any case, you can either play through the game and form your own hypothesis about the story or read forums, subreddits, and watch summary videos.\n\nGameplay\nI mentioned before that this game is beautiful and frustrating, and that the beautiful gameplay helps to push you to want to overcome the frustrating difficulty. The game is all about its fast and fluid combat, peppered with some exploration and secret finding. Both combat and exploration are equally rewarding and enticing, calling you to tackle both with the same measure of dedication over how simply they are founded by complex they are in their execution.\n\nYour first task in HLD is to explore. You pick a path of one of three cardinal directions and set out on your journey to that quadrant's unique ecology. The first few zones, broken up by a fade-to-black transition, are peaceful, serene. The monsters do not live directly on the outskirts of the centralized city. This allows you to familiarize yourself with the environment, and also find a few secrets.\n\nSecrets are found either by running along the walls and finding a hidden alcove or finding invisible platforms to dash onto and find a nearby island of goodies. Once you understand this is how all secrets are hidden, you'll be running along the outskirts of every zone you find. Yet, the secrets are so plentiful that this never feels tedious or unrewarding. They offer resources that are sparse and you are happy to receive them.\n\nThe other half of the gameplay is combat, which is split into thirds: dashing, slashing, and shooting. Movement in combat depends on your dashing between enemies, either to escape or to close the gap and strike. Dashing is fixed to three quick dashes and a short recovery before you can execute those three again. Slashing is much of the same, where you are allowed three quick hits with your sword before having a second to recharge. Shooting is to be used to take out far off enemies that are too dangerous to approach directly or if you want to destroy those last few pips of their health, safely.\n\nObviously, combat is designed very simply. Even the upgrades are few as to not over complicate the process. However, enemies are smart, and many have moves that can take out almost half your health in a single attack. Some will trap you in a pattern and kill you without you realizing what happened. Each enemy has their own tactics and its up to you to figure those out and exploit the weakness in them. Does an enemy dash at you to attack? Bait them into readying their dash, and then dash before they hit you, then close the gap and hit them while they're recharging.\n\nBosses operate on the same rules, just turned up to 11. In typical boss fashion, they are faster, stronger, and have far more health than their minions. Still, if you remember the principles of learning the pattern and exploiting the weakness, they can be taken down just like any other enemy. Again the Soulsborne comparison is made. Bosses are tough, but they rarely feel so difficult that you want to quit the game for being unfair (there's only one boss that I felt was overly difficult, the Western boss).\n\nAudio/Visual\nVisually this game is a treasure. It reminds us that pixel graphics is one of the most beautiful video game art styles to date. Other indie devs need to take note and remember that pixels should not just be a cheap and easy fallback for when graphics are too hard to do for their game. Everything in this game's environment is loaded with so much obvious passion and talent for the craft. On more than one occasion I had to stop and admire the vistas of overgrown ruins and the corpses of giants. Too often a game is judged on a screenshot, thereby stripping away so many of the elements that make it work as a whole and painting an unfair portrait of the game. However, with HLD, the visuals are so strong that a screenshot alone could convince someone to play the game without knowing another detail.\n\nMusically...the game kind of falls flat. The opening track is a haunting, synth-laden, and mesmerizing piece that really got me excited to hear more of what the game would give me, audio-wise. However, all the music after that is very bland, repeating itself after only a few seconds, over and over. The music is dreary, uninteresting, and doesn't help to motivate me or paint a good picture of what the world is like. Thankfully the visual art is there to pick up the slack and then some.\n\nConclusion\nHLD is a work of passion and vision, first and foremost. It's a game that takes simple elements and makes them seem gigantic with how they are utilized. A basic combat system feels engaging, overwhelming, and exciting to master. The rudimentary art style of pixilated graphics is expertly utilized to create stunning and shocking environments and monsters. Exploration, as a concept, is limited in its components but never feels hollow, and is instead an enjoyable experience. The story, while vague, gives you just enough to get you started and leaves the rest scattered about the game world for you to discover.\n\nStill, it's not perfect, and in its quest of "the beauty of simplicity," HLD forgets some necessary elements. The story isn't developed enough, and the music feels uninspired and redundant. More puzzles would have been nice, and exploration, while fun, could have done with more ways to be conducted. I fully expect people to say $20 is too much for a 5-7 hour game, but assigning a monetary value to hours of content rather than the quality of content itself can only do a disservice to those nay-sayers.","April 6","true","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's minimalistic, mysterious. Its lore is interesting to dig up.\n+ Fighting's done very well; it's fast-paced and you can always be in control.\n+ Level design of most areas is impressive, most secrets have some hint.\n+ Overall boss fights are challenging and interesting.\n+ Enemies are somewhat varied...\n\n- ...although each has max 2 attacks and most have only one.\n- There are only few interesting characters/stories in the world. And they are short and simple.\n- In some fights game throws at you large numbers of same type of enemies - it's challenging, but it's not interesting (conversly some fights have waves set up really well).\n- "open-world' doesn't work for me in this game. The world feels too small and cramped. I feel like it would work better in Demon's Souls style world with warpins only from/to selected places and no direct connections between the hub and the zones.\n- weapon upgrading is just redundant in its currect form.\n- some secrets require wall-hugging/sixth sense to be found.\n- map is useful only for collecting modules\n- Big problem is the amount of content that's not present in final product, although you can see it in 2014 trailer and Kickstarter goals. Bosses, weapons, areas, modes. Even without knowing about it you can fell the game is rushed, especially in South-surface area.\n\nOverall the game's functional (for me), and it's fun that's why I still recommend it, but at the same time I know that HM can do much better. I think that just the scope of what they wanted to make was too much for them, that's why the cuts.\n\nSo why I recommend preview build?\nIt's essentialy the best designed section of the final game, but designed even better. It feels much more complete and coherent. Every secret has some hint, no wall-hugging's needed. It has nearly all that final game nails, and omits elements that didn't work out as much. You only have to accept the fact that it's just a preview build, so it's 2h long.\n\nPS I might edit this review later if anything will spring to mind.","April 1","true","15.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not since Fez has a game melded old school pixel graphics with modern day mechanics. Unlike Fez however, this is an action packed ARPG style top down shooter.\n\nThe combat is buttery smooth. Animation is perfect and the environment is gorgeous. Everything in the game that exists is there for a reason.\n\nThe game presents a rock solid difficulty progression and the ability to free-roam depending on what challenge you feel like taking on that session.\n\nI was starting to lose a bit of faith in the indie realm for this year. But this is my new favorite of 2016 and the very definition of great game design. Bravo.","April 1","true","11.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

To those people: Get better at games and you might enjoy them more.\n\nThe good:\nThe sound\nThe graphics\nThe world building\nThe difficulty\nThe choice to make dodging a necessary and core mechanic from the beginning\nThe choice of silence and storyboards to keep the immersion\n\nThe bad:\nThere's some places where direct progress is too hidden. Like, after you complete the first boss, it should be more obvious how to continue forward. Same with the entrance to said boss.\nI definitely won't complain about the crazy number of secrets and mandatory exploring, but main paths should never be hidden.\nYou guys need to watch strangers play your game, without telling them how to progress, and figure out where they're getting tripped up. Do this at least 50 times. Tweak your levels when there's something at least 5 people are getting hung up on understanding that is actually mandatory.\nI didn't figure out the chain dash until I had it for 30+ minutes, went back to the dash test room, and noticed the counter.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mephiles/recommended/257850/","Mephiles","Daemon Mephiles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mephiles/","195 products in account","After waiting for this game for 2 years.  It finally arrived, but at the cost of the game promised kickstarter strech goals features, that is still on the way.  Thankfully the base game itself is very much a complete experience.  Don't expect a long game, it will take you about 5 or 6 hours to complete.  Which to me is fine and the replay value is pretty high.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a top down action/adventure game that is set in a mysterious Cyberpunk/Fantasy world of the unknown.  You play as a Drifter who suffers from a nasty disease and must traverse into this strange unknown land to find a cure, while dealing with all sorts of pearls.  The story has no dialogue, its instead told by the visuals and photos of what has transpired here.  It offers good clues and histroy about this world before everything became a nightmare.  I only wish the game did expand upon it, if it did have more levels.  Hopefully it'll come in later weeks or months.\n\nGameplay is probably one of the most fun experience I had in 2016.  It mixes combat bits from Bloodborne, Legend of Zelda and Diablo into a single game.  The result is a brutal, challenging combat I have ever played.  Be warned that it's one tough game, but I honestly think it's one of the most fair games ever made.  There's not one moment that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me the hell off.  A lot of deaths will come by your actions, so you have to be very careful on how you deal with tough situations in either 4 levels that you can start with at anytime.  Boss Fights are fun and fair, the enemies are designed well enough (thou I wished they added more, but we'll see.), the controls and combat mechanics are solid.  I do recommend playing with the controller either the PS4 or 360 is up to you.  The Keyboard & Mouse controls are underwhelming, it's very customizable but the experience is better played with the controller.  Level design is solid with good amount of secrets to find and loads of hidden story bits to discover.  You'll be sucking the life outta this game for some time, if you want to see it all.\n\nVisually, it's one fine looking game.  I do think most indie games that tried so hard to capture the old school visuals of the past, but Hyper Light Drifter to me looks more interesting than Undertale.  The detail is solid and the animations are slick and beautiful to look at.  The Soundtrack is also good and it fits well to the game's grim nature.\n\nOverall: While Hyper Light Drifter doesn't provide the ultimate complete experience that we were promised but I do hope Hearts Machine will continue supporting this game for quite awhile.  There's a lot of love been put into this title.  It isn't perfect as the game short lengh and only 4 levels begs for more.  But I strongly recommend this game.  It's challenging, fun and highly replayable.  It might be the best indie game since Shovel Knight.","April 1","true","17.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Looking for that last collectible in an area turns into a big chore.\n\nBut all that aside I enjoyed it enough to beat it basically overnight,  combat is fast quick and satisfying and bosses even more so.

I saw it and knew it was going to be a game right in my wheelhouse, so I am a bit biased towards the game from that perspective. I have about 2 hours into Hyper Light Drifter and it is wonderful.\n\nThe game is gorgeous, the controls are satisfying, and the soundtrack is very atmospheric. If you like atmospheric games with a more skill-based lean than story-driven narrative, this game will be right up your alley. I honestly have very little understanding of what is happening in the story or why my character is driven to do the things he is doing but I'm really likining the game regardless.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game is the 30fps lock. I really wish this game was able to get up to 60fps. Occasionally the frames dip as well when there are a lot of enemies on the screen and my computer is pretty powerful so this may be a struggle for lower end PCs.

Played two hours of actual game so far with the other seven being the Preview Build.\n\nSo far, I have to say that the combat is great and requires you to think rather than just mash the button over and over to defeat enemies, there is a variety of things to purchase and unlock with the golden things you find through the world that make your character and weapons better, the soundtrack is great and probably my favorite from Disasterpeace, the intro cutscene was amazing from the looks to the music and forboding feel, there are many things to find and collect in the world along with many hidden areas that are sure to give the dedicated of explorers many smiles during their playtime, I like the game having no text to read from characters and such-all dialogue is done through pictures when you talk to a character, them basically showing you what they are trying to say which gives the player the feel of piecing the story together and wondering what has happened to these characters, the game plays wonderful on a controller-I dont understand at all people complaining about the dashing or the combat in the slightest because every feels very tight and crisp, the visuals are great with a varied color pallete that is distinct for each of the four main lands of the game, enemies are varied in my opinion and all look great and have somewhat different behaviors, and lastly the animation on everything in the world and distinctness between every character you see and meet is rather nice and makes you feel like these people are making do in a world with dangers all around this city.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone that enjoys rpgs in the veign of Link to the Past and the challenge and patience of Dark Souls style combat.\n\nPart 2 - 17.5 hours full release completion\n\nBasically all the stuff I said in the first review along with some extras. All the bosses were interesting and having some level of strategy to them with the things that made each of them unique from one another. The use of upgrades for both your weapons and your dash ability is super satisfying, killing the final boss with six of his projectiles reflected back at him was awesome. I personally enjoyed the story being told only through images, cinematics, and the areas instead of text like most other games. Each area was unique in design and asthetic and had some sort of backstory you could learn from the npc you can talk to in each area. As you play the game you are likely to grow attached to the other drifter you meet in each area and feel terrible and it is your duty to avenge him when he eventually dies. The six different guns in the game are, well, different from one another and call all be used to take on a situation differently whether you want to snipe at a distance, shotgun up close, or use a pistol as a utility between sword attacks. Half of the people in the forums are great people and have come together to find many interesting secrets, help one another, and even translate the igname language. The other half cant stop complaining about 30fps which doesnt bother everyone in the world and some people mentioned in the Special Thanks part of the credits (btw, the ST part of the credits is nearly always pooled from all the devs in any production, meaning that the ideals and thanks of one can completely conflict with the ideals and thanks of the others. It's like we're all human or something). All the different equipment sets provide you many different passive abilities that provide some extra replayability and thought when going into a boss fight or an area for the first time. Personally, my current favorite build is BlueWhite for my companion, Pink sword, and White cloak. There's also alot of collectibles for anyone that likes to get everything out of a game.\n\nOverall, this game was a great 17.5 hour adventure rpg (nearly 100%) with great combat, visuals, soundtrack, and an interesting story with a bitter-sweet ending. I recommend it to anyone in need of a fun game that requires you to think and recommends searching every nook and cranny.","March 31","true","35.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I will regard it as one of my dream games.\n\nI can go on about the breathtaking pixel artstyle and excellent sound design... but I will choose not to as you already can get the hint from the trailers and other users.\n\nWhat I will be describing here is my personal unbiased experience of the gameplay.\n\nPROS:\n\n1) Fluid and Responsive combat: that requires the right timing in order to overcome your enemies. Every enemy has a window of oppurtunity to strike them hard including the super challenging bosses. Resulting in a deadly dance of death as you drift around the battle field slashing your enemies before they can strke you and drifting away at just the right moment. Rarely have I played a combat so satisfying, easy to learn and hard to master.\n\n2) Bosses: seldom have I faced challenge in recent past when a game threw me a boss. Reminded me of the goold old days when overcoming a boss felt like a real achievement to show off. Every boss fight is unique and memorable!\n\nThose negative reviews that you have been reading about super hard bosses is only a complaint of people who didn't try enough. Personally it took me around 10 tries for each boss to beat (including the last one). I am not a super pro at games and consider myself average.\n\nThe key is knowing your enemy and timing your attacks and using your upgraded abilities by thinking on your feet. It is NOT unfair. Bosses are supposed to be super hard. Deal with it.\n\n3) Exploration: The world of HLD is brimming with secrets galore... every nook and cranny can lead to a secret pathway containing rare gold artifact that you can use to buy upgrades for your arsenal.\n\n4) Enemy Variety: Every region has seprate enemy units, behaviour and asthetics. Never did the game become boring slash and hack button smasher as every new enemy makes you think on your feet to deal with.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n1) Short: yes you might argue good things come in small packages but yes I believe they could have expanded each region further and add more sidequests than the overarching quest you already have. More dugeons would have helped feel the RPG and exploration aspect too. However they chose to focus and make this game purely action oriented. A lost oppurtunity if you ask me.\n\nThe intense actions sequences could have been more paced out with longer gameplay and the loot collection meta game could have breathed more space with more environments and dungeons.\n\n2) Upgrades: Though each sword and dash upgrade is unique and useful in their own way, I felt guns could have  been added with more interesting modules and addons such that modifies the shot pattern or bullets. They could have hidden these modules in secret places to make things more interesting... instead of plain upgrades to magazine.\n\nBastion is a fine example of how to enhance gameplay by adding tactical addons to your existing arsenal. I felt HLD creators lost a lot of oppurtunity here in that regard.\n\n3) Lack of Adventure: You already have all the map revealed to you in the very beginning of the game. I felt it kind of personally took away the wonder and adventure of the game which is based on exploration. Yes the map is abstract, yes you dont know the terrain or the enemy positions of the regions before you visit them, and yet I felt kind of put off by it.\n\n4) No proper quest system: Except your main quest you never encounter any NPCs giving you sidequests of clearing dungeouns / discovering hidden artifacts in lost temples. This serously kind of bummed me as I expected it to be an Action-Adventure-RPG instead they focused it on Action-RPG.\n\nThis could have elivated the game to an altogether different level. Side quests could have been equally cryptic in nature I wouldn't have mind that.\n\nThe game therefore feels a LONG fetch quest for your main questline.\n\n\nRECOMMENDED If you like intense action RPG with a challenging gameplay and breathtaking art and sound production. HLD is one of those rare gems that comes out once a while.\n\nIt has its shortcomings only because they could have made this into a even bigger and better masterpiece of a game than what it already is.\n\nRating (if that matters): 8.5/10","April 4","true","23.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As far as gameplay goes, there are comparisons to be made between both the original Zelda for it's lack of explanation of who you are and what you're supposed to be doing and Dark Souls for it's combat that rewards finese, skill, and efficiency.  You may find yourself lost at first since, as I said before, you're told nothing and are thown into a huge world. It's a bit disorienting, but you'll eventually find your bearings and the world is an absolute joy to explore. The atmosphere is spot on, the landscapes are beautiful, and it manages to capture the scale of this broken, dying world tremendously.\n\nA particularly striking moment was when I went up a mountain and in the distance saw the broken down, snow-covered corpse of an enormous mech of sorts lain on the side of a cliff. After further investigation of said mountain, I found myself next to that very same corpse; dwarfed by it's hand alone as it's lifeless body menacingly stared up at me sporting a gaping mouth and blank, dead eyes.\n\nThis game did something to me that no game has done in quite some time. It turned me into a kid again. I was on a journey in a fascinating, mysterious, and hazardous new world, trumping my adversity with the skill and precision I'd gained along my grand adventure. I wasn't traversing dangerous cliffs and trap puzzles because I was told to. I wanted to know what was in store if I'd completed said challenges. I wasn't angry when I was killed by a boss because I'd learned something from it and I was sure if I'd just adjusted my tactic I could defeat the new relentlessly fierce opponent.\n\nThat said, this game isn't for everybody. Even basic enemies can make quick work of you if you're not careful with your approach and bosses are unforgiving to put it lightly. Interestingly, though, the bosses combine the abilities of all the mobs in their zone which, in my opinion, was a fantastic design choice that forces the player to strategize, time their attacks and dodges, and really  make sure they know how to control the avatar. So they're challenging, yes, but far from impossible and certainly can be beaten in a rather reasonable amount of attempts.\n\nMy gripes with the game are minimal; a birdman NPC blinks in and out of existence for some reason, there's a strange bug where gear bits appear in one place but can be picked up in another, and I did have some slight issues with lag. That could just be my computer, though. It was really strange as well to make it so the player has to aim their gun with the left stick instead of the right; you get used to it, yeah, but I don't see why it couldn't have been the right stick seeing as it has no function anyway. Also I feel like it would have been better to not have a tutorial to add to the "figure it out" aspect of the game, but that's highly subjective and I wouldn't dock any quality points from the game because of it.\n\nOverall, if you want a game that gives you beautiful scenery, fantastically satisfying combat, and a uniquely presented and gripping story, this is for you. This may not be the game for more casual gamers, though, as those bosses can definitely give  you a run for your money.\n\nI'm not completely through with the game just yet, but as of right now it's an 8/10 for me.

HLD is one of the first games in a while that feels like I'm developing a unique skillset through playing it. So many games now rely on artificial progression systems in the form of rising statistics to add that feeling. There are unlocks in this game, but I'm the one getting better at playing it, not just my character. The different abilities complement each other well once you learn to use them.\n\nHLD might be one of those games that could be great to come into knowing nothing about it. On the other hand, I've found that knowing about the lead developer's heart condition has changed how I see the game in interesting ways. You're free to see what you want in the imagery. But what I've seen so far is a story about a character with a terminal illness, wandering a dying world in search of something. And the quality of the art and sound really helps to sell the gravitas of that story.\n\nBe warned that the game is not easy. Some of the bosses are very difficult, in my opinion. But the game is open enough that you can always come back to an area later if you get stuck. There is a lot to explore, and the game rewards you for doing so. There are many times when you may have more options than you think.","April 13","true","15.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's still a recommendation, but only barely.\n\nThe gameplay is solid. It's part Dark Souls, part 2D Zelda, part Metroidvania. You run around and slash up baddies, collect some guns and fight huge bosses. Basically what you expect from a 2D exploration game.\n\nEverything else though...it's hard to pinpoint what exactly is wrong, but I'll give it a shot. The game is very minimalist and this was done so by choice. There is no real story, no interaction with NPCs other than watching a few pictures, and the map is god awful. You will get lost just because the map says you're somewhere you're not. At that point, just remove the map altogether please.\n\nThe fact that it's an "open world" game does not make a lot of sense to me either. Here's why.\nFrom the starting point, you can go in 3 directions and buy sword, dash, health and gun upgrades with your funds. These directions and upgrades are not at all similar in terms of difficulty and knowing which way to go and which upgrade to purchase is almost crucial to make the later parts of the game easier to handle. Yes, we could argue that placing the items and areas in a set order would make it a lot more similar to traditional Metroidvania style games, but those games are good for a reason. Now, some new players will turn away from this game with a bad taste in their mouth because they didn't go the right direction or buy the right upgrades and were overwhelmed.\n\nOnce you figure out you can in fact go those three directions right from the get-go and buy the double dash and the dash that blocks bullets, the game becomes pretty interesting. Finding strategies for all the enemies and bosses is actually pretty fun, and the devs made sure that even the normal enemies can be challenging. The areas look pretty good, too. The game expresses its own art style, which is hard to do in a world with thousands of indie games per day that are very similar.\n\nThere are 4 major bosses and a final boss, and each area takes a couple of hours at most. The game is not very long in that regard, but there are a ton of optional secrets you can find. I would go back to find all these secrets, but the fact that the map is not at all helpful in any way kinda turns me away from this. To clarify: the secrets are usually hidden by a wall that looks exactly like a normal wall, so you'll find yourself derping into every single wall in hopes of finding them. I'm not particularly looking forward to doing this when there's no map to tell me I've already been there.\n\nWhat I'd really like to see is a patch that includes an actually useful map. Also, make the double dash and protective dash the first upgrades that you have to buy before you can buy anything else. That way, new players can't go wrong anymore and everyone can enjoy the game for what it is.\n","April 8","true","8.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And the guns work well, too, they have some sort of soft-lock which can miss at times, but you can manually aim them if you wish to do so.\n\nThe game encourages you to backtrack to areas you've been before after finding things from different areas to find more secrets or loot that you couldn't find beforehand, and the game takes on A Link To The Pasts mentality by letting you do the areas in any order you like, reguardless of what gear you have.\n\nThe Bosses are well designed and an absolute blast to go against. At times it can feel as if a boss is too hard and that it has a cheap way of being difficult. it doesn't every boss I've encountered so far has the potential to be beaten without being hit once, and they all clearly tell you or let you know what the bosses attacks will be by the enemies you encounter in the area beforehand.\n\nI've not finished this game yet, I have a feeling I've got another 6 or so hours to go, maybe longer. I'll update my review when I finish the game.\n\nAs of this point in time when I've completed 3 areas, I give the game an 8.5/10.\nIf you've been looking at this game and thing you should get it, the answer is a resounding yes, as you will definately NOT be disappointed.\n\n","April 2","true","18.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The combat might be tricky to some, and even though the game isn't overly difficult it can be challenging at times. Once you get the hang of it though it becomes greatly satisfying.\n\nThe world is not only amazingly beautiful, it's also well thought out and seasoned with lore. The levels are really well designed and filled with secret items and paths.

However, it is very, VERY flawed. The game is riddled with glitches, most of which you'll find without even trying. Once, an enemy jumped off a cliff, and spawned an item in the ground that was innaccessible. The AI is hilariously stupid, and will often walk into a wall repeatedly or kill itself by jumping off cliffs. The collision is enough to make a grown man cry. Sometimes I'll jump to a ledge only to land on the very edge of it and fall off. What's even worse is that falling puts you back on the ledge and you're stuck in a loop until you die. Passing a checkpoint with one health and no health restores is a nightmare, as you have to pass the next few rooms without getting hit at all since dying doesn't restore your health.\n\nOverall, unless you can get this game for 10$ or less, don't buy it.

It will waste hours of your time, and take away your enjoyment of the rest of the experience. Not only that, but using a controller makes it impossible to aim while moving, when the keyboard and mouse is able to do so that. Oh, and the map is by far the most useless map I have seen in a video game. This game desperately needs a mini-map, but lacks one. Plus there's just so many different little issues I see that it drives me mad anytime I play this game.\n\nJust as a heads up, I'm writing this review out of frustration created by this game, so I will likely exaggerate a lot here. Even though that may be true, these are still some very serious issues I have had with the game, and I genuinely want to warn those interested in this game about. With that in mind, read away!\n\nFirst off, I want to discuss the modules. Just to let you know, I spend most of my time in Hyper Light Drifter looking for the modules, which are these diamonds you need to collect around the map in order to fight the boss of an area. There are four areas in total, with four modules in each. But you wouldn't know that because the game doesn't even tell you what a module is, more or less what they do. Want to know how I discovered the name of modules? An achievement description. Yes, you heard me right, an achievement description. To make things worse, I only learned the name of the protagonist, and what their goal is through a Steam trading card. What is this, Destiny!?\n\nAnyways, getting back on topic, the issue with thse modules, is that they are required to progress. You need to find three out of four to reach the boss, and then you get the fourth after beating the boss of the area. At least that's the pattern I see after enduring one area of this game. Now yes, it may not seem that bad, but these modules are hidden in the most obscure corners of the areas. I just spent an hour trying to find one, and came back empty handed, ready to write this review. Even after you get to a halfway point in an area, and an NPC puts the location of the modules on your map, it's still too hard to find them. In fact, that leads me onto another thing I hate about Hyper Light Difter: The map.\n\nIt is beyond frustrating to figure out how the map works. You may be at one point in the map, travel north in-game, and then you decide to check your map. But wait... what's this? You moved to the west on the map! Please explain to me how that makes any sense. That's why module locations on the map are mostly useless. They just tell you it's in "that area" when "that area" is gigantic! It's like if you were trying to visit your dying mother in a hospital, but had no idea which room she's in. Obviously, you would ask the person at the front desk. But when you tell them your mother's name, they just point in the general direction of the room and tell you to go find her yourself.\n\nOh, and here's another issue: Why can you not aim with the right analog stick on the PS4 controller? That may sound like a minor issue, but as is, you can't move while aiming with a controller, when you're able to with the keyboard and mouse. I mean really, what were the developers thinking when they did that? I'd like to actually move while aiming, like you can with a keyboard and mouse! But if you use the keyboard and mouse, dodging quickly becomes too difficult. And no, that's not because that control scheme is bad. I actually spent half my time using the keyboard and mouse and really enjoyed it. It's just that you need incredibly high sensitivity (and some pretty insane reflexes) to dodge fast enough with the keyboard and mouse. However, I finally decided to try out the controller, and found that I enjoyed that control scheme more. I just don't understand why aiming with a controller has to restrict movement. And no, do not tell me "oh, well that gives each control scheme advantages and disadvantages." No, these are not playable characters, these are different control schemes. That is an excuse, not an argument. Each control scheme should have the exact same useful features (useful meaning that it actually provides some function to gameplay, and isn't just a useless feature there for laughs).\n\nFinally, I want to know why the developers removed the feature of getting health packs refilled when teleporting. How does removing the feature to refill an already infinite number of healing items make the game harder? It had actually fixed a design flaw, but the developers instead decided to put that flaw back into the game! My logic for it not raising difficulty, is because health packs are already unlimited. Having health packs refilled upon teleporting only saved the player time. But no, now you have to go back to previous areas you've already beat, and get the health packs again without getting hit. That isn't difficult, that's just really inconvenient.\n\nOther than all that, the game is great. The combat is really fun, challenging, and smooth. The game looks and sounds great. I frequently found myself just staring at the scenery. Plus, it's an incredibly unique game. It's just that you'll spend far too much of your time revisiting areas, and trying to find those cursed modules in order to progress. This sucked all fun out of the game for me, and has frustrated me more than any other game I have played.","April 16","false","4.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

It does a few things fairly well.  The combat is fun and fluid, the art is great, and the soundtrack is nice.\n\nHowever, I feel like the game does a lot of things wrong.  For starters, my biggest complaint with the game is the world in it.  You have a decently sized world, but it feels completely lifeless.  None of the characters in the game actually have any dialogue, and all speak through pictures, the story is very loosely explained (And even then, it's EXTREMELY vague on what's actually going on), and while this has sort of become a trend in certain games, it just leaves me feeling disconnected from the game's world, and I don't feel "invested" enough into it.\n\nThe other complaint I have, is a lot of things feel too same-y.  The areas in the game, the enemies, and even just the core gameplay itself.  The main areas in the game have a lot of different rooms and whatnot within them, but there's really not much that makes them feel unique.  The enemies are kind of the same in this regard.  There's just not a lot that really stands out at all, especially compared to the first Kickstarter trailer for the game, which showed a lot of unique and interesting content that was apparently cut from the final game.\n\nNow, while the combat in the game is fun, that's really all there is to the game.  There aren't any puzzles, there aren't any gripping cutscenes or conversations, there aren't any sidequests, or really anything to break up the hack 'n slash gameplay.  It just felt like I was wandering endlessly, killing everything in sight, with no real purpose or goal in doing so.\n\nAs someone who followed the game since it was first announced, and eagerly awaited its release, I was fairly disappointed with the game, and while I didn't actually complete it, I was right at the end, and just couldn't bring myself to bother finishing it, as silly as that may sound.","April 30","false","7.0"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

The world is designed similiarly to how I remember the Megaman Legends games. The way the story and world is presented however reminds me of Dark Souls.\n\nTo put simply, the game is very strange and mysterious, not really explaining to you what the protagonist's goal or purpose is. You are simply given a weapon and a healing item, and there you go, have at it. Very much like Dark Souls. The lore and the world itself reminds me much more of Megaman Legends however, aka ruins full with sci-fi artifacts.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much the later 2D Zelda games (think Minish Cap and similiar) but on Steroids, aka the fights get very fast and overwhelming very quickly. This however makes every victory ever so satisfying. The only real difference I noticed in terms of combat is that it feels more weighty than Zelda and can be compared more to Dark Souls, aka if you find yourself stuck in an attack animation and the enemy is about to hit you, you are most likely gonna have to eat that hit.\n\nThe music is a matter of taste, personally I feel like it does a great job of emphasizing the atmosphere of exploring the unknown, without really knowing why. It can get a little bit too intense in certain scenes though, where the volume just goes crazy (I am pretty sure this is intentional, lol).\n\nAnd now the bad\nThere are no rebindable controls for controllers in this game. While I didn't really have an issue with the default layout, people who wish to customize their controls to their own tastes are out of luck, unless you are planning to play with keyboard and mouse, which are rebindable as far as I could see (I didn't try the KB+M controls).\n\nThe biggest issue however, and this was discussed alot on the community hub before the game released as well, is the framerate. Without a doubt, the decision to lock a game this fast to 30 FPS was not benificial to the gameplay at all. Half of the time I die, I literally blame it on the fact that I could have reacted faster to the crazy amount of bullets and enemies flying at me if the game rendered more frames.\nIs it playable at 30 FPS? Yes, without a doubt you can enjoy the game at 30 FPS, but at the same time it would have been better for it to be at 60. Overall, it's more of an annoyance than a gamebreaking issue, so whether or not you feel comfortable with it, is up to you.\n\nConclusion\nDo I recommend this game? Oh hell yes, I do. The gameplay is stellar, the world feels compeling to explore and there are a lot of secrets hidden around. Though I would most likely have enjoyed it even more with a higher framerate, the 30 FPS lock is not stopping me from enjoying the game, at least so far.\n\nSo if you'll excuse me, I got more bullets to dodge and more pits to fall into.","March 31","true","8.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

No spoilers ahead\n\nAtmosphere: The game is just beautiful. Gorgeous. The feeling and atmosphere of the game can be predicted by the 3 trailers, but what you couldn't know is the love to details. The Birds still fly away if you walk near them, so this is a thing. But where I really was suprised is when there was a mirror which had a) a reflection of the player and b) I hit the mirror and it broke! That is just such a need detail. 11/10\nThe music fits the game great. After hearing that the music of the first trailer (which i love to death) was not composed by the composer of this game I was disappointed. When the second trailer was released I was worried, because, well I didn't really liked the music. Suprisingly the music just melts wonderful into the game while playing and just underlines the overall theme of the game.\nThe game has a feeling of solitude and mystery to it. There is not one english letter in the game so far. Just some mysterious symbols. The story is told by pictures. If you talk to story relevant NPCs they will tell their story by several pictures which you have to interprete as you see fitting. This was again rather suprising but in a good way, because this as well fits the overall theme great in my opinion.\n\nThe controls are pretty responding and feel very good, which is the foundation of such a game. It is hard. The combat is fast paced and punishing. If you don't time your attacks or movement well you will die. If you get hit by certain attacks you will get punished by falling to the ground, so if you rush headless into some enemys and one hits you once, it is almost certain that the others will hit you afterwards without giving you a chance to avoid it, because of the first mistake you made.\nYou have environmental obstacles which can kill you and will force you to think how you aproach a certain situation. So you will die a lot. Speaking of dying. You can't save the game whenever you want, it has like a checkpoint system. If you reach the checkpoint the game will save. So far these are in fair distances to one another and if you wan't to quit the game there's a message telling you how long ago the last save was.\n\nThe game offers a lot of secrets, path's you can't see on the first glance. Like in the beta there are invisible platforms, but it looks like that you can make them visible for a short time if you a) stand on them (makes the whole path visible) or if you are at the starting point you can use your companion (which gives you a signal that something is there) to make them visible.\n\nSo far I haven't understand how the level system (if this even is one) works (or rather what improves if you level up) or how the currency works in this game. Maybe those two are connected. The game will give you a really short tutorial, but it looks like you have to figure out most of the mechanics, which i really like. Hate those tutorials and taking all exploration out of a game by forcing everything down your throat.\n\n\nJust one thing. When I close the game it will crash. That is probably not a big thing, because I wanted to exit it anyway, but it just shouldn't happen after such a long development time. A beta for a game was originally a thing to test if a game is running properly and if I will stumple about bugs or if the game won't start (error message) for other people (which i've read on KS) and other systems. If something the game crashes, bugs or similar, that is a no go. You (developer) deceided to exlude most of us from a real beta test and you did this intern for story and suprise purposes (which i can kinda understand), we got "just" a preview build. So I hope you made sure that the game will work properly!\n\nAnyway great Game.","March 31","true","17.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This game is such a work of overwhelming beauty I felt compelled to voice my opinions.\n\nGameplay - When I first started playing Hyper Light Drifter, I questioned how well an action game without I-frames could work - the equivalent idea being an action game with no I frames is like a shmup with no bombs.  As I played more, I realized that when the mechanics are designed to perfection, when every error can be attributed to "no one's fault but my own", it became clear to me that I frames would have been an unnecessary bandage on polish resembling an unblemished mirror.  Aside from the major issue of the game's complete absence of I-frames, the responsive controls and the demanding chain dash timing makes every encounter feel like a personal victory - the drifter never gains level, the stats that grow belong to you, the player.\n\nAesthetic - A beautiful dreamy pastel haze, contrasted heavily by low fantasy brutality where no detail is spared.  Painterly backdrops of ruin placed at choice locations to set the tone for the upcoming area.  Besides the UI, there is not a single word voiced the entire game, however the tone and the ambience do more than necessary for successful storytelling.\n\nSoundtrack - Dynamically shifting music that is always tone appropriate, the quality of the soundtrack is on the same level as Bastion or Transistor.  However the decidedly low-fi instrumentation are chosen specifically to compliment the art design.\n\nOverall - Hyper Light Drifter is a game that is completely uncompromising in every sense of the word.  Everything about this game is honest, from the very demanding difficulty, to the heartbreaking world it's built around.  HLD is a game not only action fans would enjoy, but anyone who's sick to death of formulaic games targetting the greatest possible target audience with no regard to integrity or concinnity of design.  HLD is an original artistic vision that has been fulfilled in the most elegant way possible.\n\ntl;dr - it's really good go play it.\n\npersonal PJSalt - where's my achievement for beating Newgame+ :(","April 3","true","25.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Yes - Here is why I believe so:\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a call back to the games of old - before the internet and online guides were prevelant. During this time frame (more so the nes/snes era) games had an air of mystique, most things were never told, and the world was experienced and not explained. This is the world of Hyper Light drifter.\n\nAlso do you remember the music of your favorite games of old? You probably do. Why do you remember this? Because the music helped to build the moment, and it was integral to the world building of the game that you played. Disasterpiece (who scored Fez) did a brillant job with the score. You really feel like a wander in a strange, but not outlandish, land. The highs and lows of the music correspond with the setpieces known as the backdrops.\n\nBesides the atmosphere being a call back to older games, this game also calls back to a time before there were difficulty levels. This game is difficult, but not impossible. When you die, you don't feel like you were cheated - you just feel like you messed up. I feel like this is the mark of a well developed game - and Heart Machine should be applauded for their first time effort.\n\nThe gameplay of this game is like a mixture of zelda (the grand adventure), and the combat of modern ninja gaiden (fast and furious, with multiple weapons). The movement system that they implemented - a chainable dash - was a great idea as it makes traversing the huge map quite easy (you also have the ablity to teleport to certain locations at any given time - even in dungeons).\n\nThe last time that I felt so good about a neo-classic game was when I played Fez. The difference between this game and fez however (besides the genre/gameplay/etc) is that when playing this game, you will know if you missed something. You will not need ultra complicated maps, decoder rings, etc to be able to get the most of the game. Take your time, enjoy the ride. You will find all sorts of secrets that will make you feel proud of yourself.\n\nSo is Hyper Light Drifter a good game - in my opinon - yes\nIts a throw back to the difficult and yet imaginative days of old - yet its formula helps it to be able to stand on its own without nostalgia.","April 3","true","16.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I'd recommend anyone play it if they enjoy difficult games. I've also not beat the game in New Game + yet, I'll get to that in a few days.\n\nAlright, onto the review.\n\nLet's start with the combat system. It's great, easy to pick up. It's satisfying, challenging, fun, and balanced all at once. Enemies can attack through your attacks most of the time, meaning there's no stunlocking any enemies. You have to strategically plan your hits to make sure you hit the enemies enough times and then dash out of the range of their attacks. Multiple enemies can be hard to deal with, but that's why the game includes ranged weapons. Not meant to be used as primary means of damage, but the ranged combat is an easy way to lessen the numbers of enemy groups into more manageable sizes. Bosses, on the other hand, are really, really tough. You've got a lot of health to get rid of, and you only take a few hits\n\nNext up is the visuals and sound. Both are fantastic, truly masterpieces. The visual style is simple in color, but the lighting and quality of animations and detail makes up for any and all mistakes made. Those mistakes are very few and far between, and very hard to see when you're just playing the game. The music is amazing, each area's music slowly changes depending on where you are and what's going on around you. If you're underground, if there are enemies around, if the room you're in is more of a puzzle room, the little touches make it all that much better. What else did we expect? Disasterpiece did the music for the game.\n\nAlright, now we'll look at general gameplay. Most of it's self-explanatory. The movement system is great, just the perfect blend of slippery but perfectly controllable. The dashing system is a nice way to get around fast, and with some practice, Chain Dash can get you around even faster. There's been a few times when I've fallen off of ledges due to minor things, but it doesn't punish you much for falling out of the world. Health packs are thankfully abundant, if you explore enough. The upgrade system is straightforward, but I wish there was a liiiitle more variety in the way of things you can collect for upgrades.\n\nThere's nothing really to write on the story of the game, it's really vague. Play yourself or watch someone else play, then figure out what you want to think of it.","April 3","true","14.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Unfortunately Hyper Light Drifter seems to be very poorly optimized for anyone arguing against using a controller, which I don't have the ability to play the game with in the first place. As much as I'm willing to sacrafice a joystick's versatile direction scheme for the simple and stupid eight directions WASD allows, I can't tolerate the fact that certain functions of the game seem to be broken by K+M use in the game.\n\nMy problem is only this for the time being: it doesn't seem to be possible to change chain dashing direction with just WASD. I can't complete several portions of secrets to the levels in the game without being able to do this. Until an update is released that better accomodates the use of a keyboard, I'm afraid I'll have to shelf HLD.

HLD has done an incredible job delivering a beautiful, well-crafted game into a pixel art form with an excellent aesthetic and kind of unique per say, emerging simplistic but nice sound design helps to add beauty to this game. The game mechanics are very simple but it has enough depth to create very complexed and challenging both puzzles and fights, although sometimes it can be overwhelming making the overall experience enjoyable.\nWith a large amount of puzzles - secrets and collectables to obtain is more than likely you will spend 20+ hours to discover them all. The sense of exploration is but the lack of map only readable by the creators is comes down to your memory, is really frustrated to see how bad the map in this game is, it reminds me of FEZ a map that only the creators themselves understand it.\n\nNow HLD presents a weird story, tackling a similar approach of games like Dark Souls where much is left to the player to discuss it, and create their own theories. The problem with this HLD doesn’t deliver enough content and ideas to even create a sense story. It was very disappointed for me see the ending, not only didn’t explained what or where I was there but the ending boss was super easy with 2 tries only I figure him out, in fact it was more challenging the waves of monsters in the town, or the 800+ dashes challenges than the final Boss, so all the hype that caught me to this point was left to bad.\nThe game itself personally think lacks of content, the only incentive to collect all the keys are sort of skins but not really, they are color palette swapping of your original character making you wonder wasn’t enough funding for this game to at least have some extra skins or features. Lastly CO-OP feels cheap, the enemies have same life so the difficult doesn’t increase and makes it easier, the second player can’t interact with the world is just feel doesn’t have the same impact in the game.\n\nSo Hyper Light Drifter as it stands now is beautiful well-crafted game that lacks of content and narrative design and feels more like a lazy design rather than simple. If you want some interesting story this isn’t the game for you, if you prefer some action game with quick fast phased the game does deliver.\n","May 9","false","50.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I spent 3 years following it after backing it on Kickstarter and was sorely disappointed with a game that could be beaten (although not 100% completed) in less than eight hours. Not only that, but I paid $20 for it.\n\nThose who claim this game is difficult probably just aren't very adept at playing many games. The fighting is repetitive, predictable, and forgetful. There are only a handful of enemies in each section of the map and the bosses prove to be the most difficult, though not overpowering. The story, if you can call it that, is vague at best and the best part is that when I beat the game, it froze and whatever ending there was supposed to be, I missed. I'm not really curious enough to play through again to see what happened.\n\nI don't see the intrigue to the New Game+ because the regular game was so underwhelming. The graphics are beautiful, the soundtrack is ambient and relaxing, and the movements are pretty fluid. However, the amount of abilities is pretty limited so there's not much variety to your attacks.\n\nAgain, I really wanted to like this game, but for this price, I just can't recommend it.","April 19","false","9.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Every new mechanic lets you unlock new areas of the map and/or reach previously inaccessible locations in order to further upgrade your character.\n\nThe difficulty is best described as "arcade difficulty," really -- some may compare it to Dark Souls (ahem...opening sentence), but the truth is that the game plays very much like a retro RPG.  Meaning that there are stretches of quiet and beautiful scenery and music followed by frantic monster-filled fights where you slowly learn which threats the most pressing and which you can deal with after dispatching that  freakin' caster.\n\nIn line with the above, the game says it is best played with a controller, though I found that using a mouse works fine, too.  The only thing I would mention, though, is that your character's field of view moves as you move the mouse around to target/aim at things.  Before getting the hang of it, that mechanic produced a little motion sickness, so be careful not to let your mouse fly around (remember that almost everyting is accomplished with the keyboard.\n\nIn case you all are interested, my friend has started a playthrough of the game here (caution, spoilers):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rU8Lyqm1Lo","April 3","true","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Hyper Light drifter is one of those rare games, and it doesn't dissapoint.\n\nAt the time of this review I'm only two hours in, but I'm already hooked. Hyper Light Drifter is a hack and slash that hits every note with perfect precision, and manages to add it's own beautiful twist that makes it unique. Let me explain.\n\nThe Atmosphere: You are probably already aware that the art style is absolutly fantastic, but the trailers don't give away the full story. Each set piece feels like it is well thought out, and each screen is beautifully composed. Even more so, the music adds to the atmosphere and mood without being distracting or obtrusive. The sound of this game strikes a fantastic balance between emotive expression and being a delicate background foundation to the game. Even the sound effects feel masterfully created. I can not rave about the way this game presents itself more. It is top shelf.\n\nThe Story: So far I'm only right at the very start of the game, but the story has already drawn me in, and it has managed to do so with absoltly no text. This game takes the idea of "show, don't tell" very seriously, and it absolutly delivers. It didn't take very long at all for me to become invested in the characters, and the world feels very real and lived-in. It is hard for me to find fault. Granted, this early on it is entirely possible for the story to fall appart later on, but given how expertly the beginning of the game is constructed, I highly doubt the rest of the story will be anything but fantastic. I'm excited to discover more about this world and the people who inhabit it.\n\nThe Combat: No game is perfect, and Hyper Light Drifter is no exception. The combat feels tight and responsive, but beyond that it doesn't really introduce anything too exciting. Combat is neither brutally hard nor boringly easy, but it can be a little frustrating. Enemy's attacks will follow you accross the screen after you dash out of the way, which can lead to the annoying experience of dodging an enemy's attack only to have the enemy fly accross the screen and kill you anyway. Combat is a little punishing, with enemy's two-hitting you from very early on, meaning you have to play perfectly to progress, and might need to retry a fight ten or more times before you can move on. The ranged weapon feels pretty underpowered, with very limited ammo and an awkward aiming system. Using the gun often feels like a waste of time and effort. Your sword is much more effective, and doesn't cost ammo. On top of that your abilities are the same powers we've seen a hundred times over. One melee attack, One ranged attack, and a dash. Don't get me wrong, the combat is /fine/, but it is only fine where the rest of the game is great.\n\nAll up this game does not dissapoint, and I'm excited to see where the game takes me and what the company produce in the future. Solid performance.\n\nTLDR; Game is good. Spend $$$.","March 31","true","19.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I want to rip my ♥♥♥♥ing hair out playing this game and yet the feeling of accomplishment everytime I beat a spot that makes me rage is more and more satisfying.

It is not something you can just hammer the LMB/X/A - buttons and succeed at. It's got complex combat and gameplay.  There is no dialogue.  The game doesn't hold your hand at all.  It's totally open world, and you are free to go wherever and do whatever you need to do to advance.  Boss fights are brutal, and a "try and die and try again until you don 't die" situation....there were times I wanted to punch a hole in my wall or strangle a baby kitten over some of the mechanics in this game......\n\n.....and it is hands down, without exaggeration, one of the top 3 video games I have <EVER> played in my 40 years of life.  This game is Legend of Zelda meets Tron meets Tides of Numenera.  It is Dune + Star Wars + Mad Max combined. It is perfect in almost every way.\n\n10/10.\n\nPROS:\n\n-outstanding game world in a post-apocalyptic future/medieval theme\n-awesome array of weaponry and upgrades\n-creative and unique boss and enemy designs\n-music and sound are spectacularly done (I would buy the soundtrack!)\n-colorful yet bleak color pallet that works beautifully\n-complex combat yet with a simple design\n-artistic, amazing style\n-animation is top notch and fluid\n-so many secrets and unlockable places/rooms\n-extremely rewarding sense of accomplishment when you finally kill a boss or complete an ambush\n\nCONS:\n-difficult, frustrating combat (sometimes)\n-difficult, frustrating bosses (sometimes)\n-difficult, frustrating trying to find all keys and upgrade chips (sometimes)\n-REALLY really difficult to see greyed out mouse-cursor on certain tilesets\n-rather unresponsive keyboard/mouse controls. Sometimes you can get 'stuck' on the corner of a random corner/boulder/crystal while getting wrecked by turrets and mobs. (If you're going to release a PC game, you should assume most gamers on PC do not use a console controller and don't want to - designing a PC game AROUND using console controllers is like designing a PS4 game that needs keyboard and mouse) - but this is preference and my general observation. There needs to be more slipperiness to movement around corners and walls.\n-the healing delay can be really frustrating in the midst of combat. I have died so many times while trying to heal to a stray bullet (you have to get the timing down)\n-the 'stand up and move on' animation after you die takes entirely too long and is infuriating\n-really, really brutal side-games that requires entirely too much time devotion to accomplish for a small reward (I'm looking at you, 800 count chain-dashing mini-quest! Really guys? 800????)\n\nBuy this game. It's wonderful. I want more. I -NEED MORE-!\n\n","April 4","true","31.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Just look up some footage of it, you'll see what I mean.\n+ Heavy music combined with beautiful scenery creates a jaw-dropping atmosphere.\n+ Game does not hold your hand on this one. There's no help button, no hidden hints. You just have to figure it out. Personally, I like that.\n\nI bought this game on a whim, and have been absolutely blown away by how good this game is so far.\n\nP.S. use a controller or suffer.","April 3","true","18.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The art is breathtaking. The monster and character design is some of the best. The atmosphere is original and interesting. The gameplay reminds me of link to the past but takes it a step further adding some great gameplay elements that make it fresh. The only downside is I though it was too short.  9/10 wanted more.","April 3","true","11.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The presentation of this game was what really caught my eye and the beta that came midway during its development helped remind everyone what this game was all about.\n\nQuite frankly, I've never been so mesmarized by an atmosphere since FTL and Dark Souls. Hyper light drifter did just that and more without any dialogue whatsoever. The game is mysterious and unfolds at a pleasant pace. The soundtrack is very grandiose and dynamically changes depending on the scenery.\n\nThe combat is very fast paced and it'll have you looking around like a bullet hell game ; paying attention to enemy movement and closing in at an opportune time. Even the creator of this game shared his thoughts on his game's combat mechanic, saying that he prefers smarter enemies over larger ones, and boy did he drive that point home! Even the easiest of enemies can dodge, lure, ambush, and flank the player during encounters!\n\nYes, I am in love with the amount of hard work that has been poured into the game and I truly hope there will be a sequel very much like this. Truly worth the investment.","April 3","true","27.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
