The residents of a small village have been kidnapped by someone and you, Toby, decide to go after them in an effort to rescue your fellow villagers from this evil person who has taken them. Your journey to find the residents will take you through several different landscapes and force you to face many traps and dangers along the way.\n\nPresentation\nToby’s art style is somewhere between that of LIMBO and Feist, taking LIMBO’s bleak foreground and adding a splash of colour in the background to create the various landscapes you find yourself in. This art style works well for this kind of game as can be seen in the other games I’ve already mentioned and Toby is no exception. The characters and objects throughout the game all look really good and the splash of colour I mentioned earlier adds some vibrancy to the game, making it a little less despressing than LIMBO for example.\n\nGameplay\nToby is very much focused on the puzzles you come across throughout the game though it does have more of an adventure game feel to it at times.\n\nThe puzzles can be split into two categories. You have what are effectively just obstacles that you need to work out how to get around/past and you have more traditional puzzles such as looking out for symbols on a level and then putting them in the right order later on to open a doorway. Both of these vary in difficulty across the game though they are generally harder the further into the game you are. I’ll remain relatively vague to avoid spoilers but solutions to puzzles/obstacles are often hidden in the levels and you often stumble upon them by accident, personally I quite liked this though I imagine others won’t. Some obstacles felt very much luck-based, something I didn’t like. What do I mean by this? Sometimes to get past an obstacle you have to ‘do something’ at a specific moment which is made difficult by the main character’s slow movement.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier the game does have an adventure game feel to it at times. Obviously the levels aren’t completely jam-packed with puzzles and obstacles so you’ll sometimes find yourself simply walking around for a few seconds, perhaps crossing some platforms etc. While these sections aren’t particularly exciting they do give you a good opportunity to enjoy the game’s locations and visuals.\n\nControls\nOne of the most important parts of a platforming game is how well the game controls. Toby is somewhat mediocre in this department since the controls are reasonably responsive but Toby himself moves quite slowly. This isn’t really an issue for around 70% of the game but it’s when you come to the kind of obstacles that I mentioned earlier where timing is key that this can become somewhat frustrating, forcing you to retry sections several times before you’re able to move on.\n\nI did have an issue where pausing the game would make any control inputs (after un-pausing) exit from the level back to the main menu. However, this seems to be an issue that only I encountered so I wouldn’t worry about it too much.\n\nAudio\nToby’s sound effects and soundtrack are good throughout. The soundtrack always fits nicely with what’s going on in the game and there’s some somewhat dramatic music played during certain scenes that sets a nice atmosphere for said scenes. Some traps have audio cues attached to them which gives you a chance to avoid them, while not all of them have this it’s nice to have a little help every so often.\n\nMiscellaneous Toby: The Secret Mine is made by a solo developer with the help of a freelance musician and artist. Considering it’s such a small group of people working on this game it’s pretty impressive that they’ve made what they’ve made.\nThere are twenty-six levels for you to enjoy, it’s hard to say how long the game takes to complete since how long each level takes for you to complete depends on how good you are at the game (or how bad in my case).Verdict\nWorth Purchasing.\n\nToby: The Secret Mine is a good puzzle-platformer game with great visuals and challenging gameplay, made by just three people. While it may not be as good as some of the games it’s inspired by Toby is a solid addition to the genre.\n\nReview Copy Provided.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","October 20, 2015","true","7.0"," 77 of 99 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","77","99","2","4"

In my opinion, to better.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You play as Toby, a creature whose friends were stolen by, well, bigger creatures. You have to overcome different obstacles which include puzzle solving, good timing and learning from mistakes. The concept is simple and it's well executed.\n\nPros:    Visuals | Well, as I mentioned, this game kinda looks like Limbo. However, T:TSM is much brighter and has more contrast colours. There are also different-themed areas such as snowy and forest areas. Animations are also made well.\nControls | I played this game with both keyboard and Steam Controller and I liked them both. You have to figure out a few things when you start playing, though.\nPuzzles | There are some puzzles in this game, some are hard and some are a bit easier. To be honest, I think this was the best puzzle-solving experience I've ever had. The puzzles are fair  (although you might need a bit of time to figure out T:TSM's way of handling secret passages)\nSoundtrack | I really enjoyed the music that is included in this game. There is not just one looping soundtrack, but there are multiple songs written for different environments and action areas. I hope there will be a soundtrack DLC in the future.\nPerformance | The smoothness of Toby's running will bring joy to your heart! The game loads fast (it is made in Unity) and there are barely any loading screens. If there are any, they take 2-3 seconds tops.\nExtra Stuff | Toby can chase after his friends on SteamOS and MacOS and his adventure will bring you Trading Cards! He won't award you with achievements, though.\nCons:    Length | This game is about 3 hours long. If you don't screw up too many times, that is. Although short, this game offers a nice experience, so this is not too big of a problem.\nLast Levels Difficulty | Overall, the gameplay is just as hard as it should be, but the last level and a few before can be seriously hard. You will figure out to do in the first minute or two, but the execution of your plan to pass the level can prove to be insanely hard. On the last level alone, I spent about 20 minutes. There is still this, though: those 20 minutes were hella fun.\nThe final verdict:If you enjoyed Limbo or another game I have reviewed, Feist, this game is another one you will enjoy. Even though that this game is fairly short, you fill find it enjoyable. A few highlights that separate Toby: The Secret Mine from other similar games are different level environment and more sophisticated puzzles (note that they can be very hard sometimes).\nI enjoyed this game very much and I don't think 10$ is a very high price, but if you see this game on sale, you should definitely grab it.\n\nAdditional screenshots:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=567893115\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=567893010\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=567892862\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

In my opinion, there are very few things the game does right, and there's a lot that it does wrong.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThere are neat interactive puzzles from time to time which you figure out from clues around the area - or unfortunately, by bruteforcing the answer before you get stabbed in the back. With Limbo, a case could be made for being extra careful to not die, but this game forces you too many times to guess right, or die trying. It leaves the player feeling like the game took a cheap shot at them, rather than making them think, "I could have avoided that." The other challenge comes with timing. It's sometimes fun, and sometimes frustrating. It's fun when it's obvious you messed up, but that's not always the case (as I said, guess or die trying).\n\nCONTROLS\nThe character feels slow, but smooth when it's working well. Sometimes, you may find yourself getting stuck floating on a ledge, jumping very little, or being killed by horrible collision detection. You get teleported sometimes, which didn’t impact my gameplay, but takes away from the immersion and mood the environment is trying to set.\n\nVISUALS, ENVIRONMENT, & SOUND\nThis game copies the visual essence of Limbo, and changes some things to make it unique. The idea of a more variable color palette while keeping the eerie feeling one gets when playing Limbo is good, but poorly executed. The environments change abruptly between levels, and the overall design feels less interesting and more lazy.\n\nFreeing people (read: collecting them), jumping, activating, and many other sound effects seem to come out of the default resource pack that comes with the engine. These sounds pop out in a way that doesn't blend well with the rest of the game. A decent soundtrack enhances the mood, but gets interrupted here and there when going through certain zones within the level. After 18 levels, the game became boring, and the puzzles were not enough for me to keep playing.\n\nSO... SHOULD YOU BUY IT?\nIf you loved Limbo and want more of it, wait for Limbo 2. If you're interested in this type of game and haven't played Limbo yet, get Limbo instead. If you just want to play another puzzle platformer that won't take up much of your time, this is a good choice.\n","December 30, 2015","false","2.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

Your quest is to free your friends from those horrible cages!\n\nToby: The Secret Mine is a puzzle platformer/adventure type of game where you take control of a small, cute but rather dark creature called Toby. During your journey, you will have to figure out puzzles (certainly challenging but not to the point of frustration) and rescue as many of your friends as you can to move forward into the game. This game has been inspired by games like Limbo and Nihilumbra; you will be familiar (if you play this type of games) with the very nice shadowing environmental artwork but not as dark as some games of the same genre.\n\nToby will have to be very careful where he puts his feet - spiky traps can be fatal to our cute hero. Listen carefully to the sounds of breaking branches, this might tell you there is a pass under a specific obstacle, or it could be the entrance to a hidden area where one of your friends is kept in captivity. Do not forget, you have 26 friends to find in this game and some are obviously easy to find and some not.\n\nOur dear creature can run (but not sprint), jump and action lever to get through each level but most of the time is really about specific timing to pass obstacles. And you will be reminded on the top right-hand corner of the screen how often your timing was rather sluggish (a nice skull and crossbones), to say the least! But on the positive side it will also tell you how many of your fellow creatures you saved!\n\nFrom the control view point, gamepad is the way to go. The visual artwork is very nice and the soundtrack gives you this compelling atmosphere and the game runs smoothly.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great artwork\n-	Easy to play\n-	Variety of puzzle difficulties\n-	Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	You will finish the game between 3 – 5 hours\n-	No achievements\n\nToby: The Secret Mine is an enjoyable game to play and raise the bar in terms of execution and puzzles for this type of game!\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I pick the good ones\n═══════════════════════════════════\nOVERVIEW\nAt first, this seems to be very similar to Limbo, but since I have not played Limbo, this review will not consider the similarities.  The game is a 2D puzzle platformer with a stylized art direction.  it uses the visuals and music to tell the story in place of dialogue, that leads to an immersive experience that the game benefits from, but also has its shortcomings.\nThe game is about you going through the levels saving other "things" of your own species (the game wasn't clear about what anything is).\nThe game took me around 3 hours, and that is with me dying around a couple hundered times (or more, i honestly lost count).\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/395160/\n\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\nPros:\nunique visuals\nsimplistics gameplay that don't distract from the scenery nor add needless diffeculty to the puzzles\ncreative puzzles that are thematically different for each level\nwide variety of levels\nsoundtrack\nvery light and easy to run\n2 endings\n\nCons:\nart style makes it hard to see traps or ledges\ndiffeculty spikes near the last few levels (you will know what i mean when you get to the desert level)\ngameplay length is too short for the asking pice\njumps and puzzles require very precise timeing and positioning that makes it feel unfair at the last few levels\nstory and charecters are unengaging/uninteresting (even by the end)\nside people to save are too easy, and later in the game they just put you in too much danger\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nits a puzzle platformer that doesnt over stay its welcome, impresses with the visuals and music, entertains with the puzzles, but is very limited on story, charecters, and gameplay mechanics.

There are lots of "secret mines", i.e. bits of black that you must uncover to be a tunnel, a trapdoor or something else; there are lots of traps that kill you (but a checkpoint is always close by), a lot of mechanics (switches, keys, water levels to make rise or fall, swings and of course boxes), some monsters, and this is the first game I've seen that has living spikes (awesome). There's a bit of timing platforming, there are some "door puzzles", but all involves more trial & error than logical difficulty so far. It all works reasonably well. (I just wish there was a way to set Vsync, I'm seeing some screen tearing.) There's no plot to speak of.\n\nIf you want platforming on a grand, magical scale, get Ori and the blind Forest or Trine. Toby is a lot smaller, simpler, and cheaper (on sale on IndieGameStand for 1$+ for 3 more days), and I'm enjoying it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlemissmirage/recommended/395160/","littlemissmirage","ItsJustaMirage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlemissmirage/","73 products in account","Toby the Secret Mine is an untold story of a floppy, fox-eared creature -- with eyes too far apart -- on a quest to find his friends. Really, it's literally untold because there is no dialogue or prologue explaining to the player exactly what is going on, but then again, it doesn’t have to. The story is simplistic and can be easily understood through the imagery; even one with a lack of imagination will be able to understand. When launching the game, you will be abruptly thrown into gameplay without any tutorial as the requirement for one isn’t neccessarily needed. This game is meant to be played by learning through your mistakes and, by doing so, will help you to avoid repeating them. Although for some like myself, this isn't the case.\n\nThe game gives you control over a nimble character whose only purpose is to chase after the giant, red-eyed villain who runs off with your friends in captive. As you leap, run and pull levers, the player is tasked with the job of finding all 26 undeserving friends. Some are in plain sight while others may require a keen eye in observation to locate their position while not being too difficult that the task seems daunting.  In the beginning, whats feels like a relaxing leisure walk through a silhouette world soon comes to bite you on the butt as traps are laid out before you in secrecy, most times killing you upon discovery. Sadly, mistakes might happen often if you prefer a more fast-paced, platforming gameplay; but since this game only provides you with one speed, rushing isn’t an option. Instead, it forces you to be more deliberate even at times when you want to dash out of potiential harm. But this game isn’t meant to be a walk in the park after all. This game may be a fun title, but it is still unforgiving to an unwary player who rushes recklessly, causing frustration out of impatience.\n\nIf you rather just see a quick preview video, then click the link below! :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gCiFg6s558","November 18, 2015","true","2.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I really wanted to like this game but there is just too much wrong with it for me to be able to.\n\nThe puzzles are mostly solved either by trial and error or walking into blackness only to reveal a hidden switch, and the platforming is very awkward. Your character has no ability to move forward watsoever. You simply meander in the direction that you want to go. There is no sprint, no walk faster, and no gradual speed increase.\n\nI wanted a story. Limbo doesn't have any text and the true meaning is open for interpretation, but it communicates enough through the environment that the story develops itself. It gives us enough to make us wonder, but never enough to give us an answer. This game blatantly wears the motive on its sleeve: Big guy takes your friends, Rescue them. Thats all.\n\nLimbo feels more fluid: you start moving slowly but gradually gain speed, so taking a running start helps with long jumps. What really ruined this though is the jumping. Your character can jump almost four times its height. This would justify being able to move slightly faster than a turtle with a broken foot.\n\nTL;DR\nI really wanted to like this game, a spiritual successor to Limbo seemed like exactly my cup of tea, but its just too awkward to play and lacks enough story to be any more than a standard platformer puzzler with the same art style and a few more colors added in.","December 27, 2015","false","0.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

My apologies.\nAlso this will be shorter than my usual reviews since I don’t have that much to say about it.\nAgain my apologies.\n\nStoryTaken straight from the store page:\n\nA peaceful way of life in a small village in the mountains was thrown into disorder. Someone has kidnapped most of it’s residents. A couple of brave hearts tried to rescue their friends but none of them has returned. Little Toby didn’t want to just sit and wait so he decided to find them by himself. He went to the near deep forest but he soon realized this is just a beginning.\n\nGo with Toby on an eerie adventure in a dark and creepy world full of dangerous situations, enemies and challenging puzzles.\n\nGameplayPretty much like Limbo and your average puzzle-plattformer although I have to say it’s easier and maybe a bit too straight forward.\nWell let’s start off with the basics.\nBesides moving you’re able to perform two actions: jumping and activating stuff.\nThat’s pretty much it and there’s actually no need for anything fancy.\nThe gameplay’s not bad nor good.\nThe only thing that I really dislike is that the puzzles are, let me be blunt, too easy.\nEverything you need to solve a puzzle is pretty much near you.\n\nThe game itself plays really well and without any problems.\n\nLet’s talk about the levels and the puzzles.\nSo to start off they’re a bit too easy in my opinion. Not all of them but the majority.\nThe level design is pretty good though.\nWhile it truly takes inspiration and the look of Limbo there are also instances when it truly becomes a unique game such as the desert or the snow region. I really enjoyed and liked those the most.\nAlso I have  a love/hate relationship with the arrow traps but I like those as well.\n\nA lot of it reminds me too much of Limbo though.\n\nThe levels I mentioned earlier are what makes Toby a unique game.\n\nWhile it does draw inspiration from Limbo, well,... It also tries too much to be like it.\n\n\nVisualsIf I’m entirely honest I was a bit confused at first since it looks just so much like Limbo.\nThe level design is good though. My favorite levels are the snow ones.\nIt’s just such a huge change of scenery that I really enjoyed the game and also the very first time when I didn’t automatically compare it to Limbo.\nOther than that the game looks pretty good but not like something new.\n\nAudioThe music and sound effects do a pretty good job to present a Limbo-ish atmosphere.\nWhat I especially liked were the audio cues. In order to solve certain puzzles or to finish a level you have to listen carefully so you know where the game wants you to go next.\n\nWhat else can I say?I have been lucky enough to get a Review Key for  Toby: The Secret Mine in order to write a blunt and honest to God Review. Just as usual.\n\nI couldn’t help but feel that Toby: The Secret Mine is trapped in the shadow of Limbo.\nThat’s not such a bad thing though. I mean it’s been over four years since Limbos release so it’s a truly welcome addition to the genre.\nThe only thing that I really have to nitpick is … well it does look like a Limbo clone. There I said it.\nI’m sorry but that’s actually also what it is. Yet again that’s not a bad thing.\nIt’s a perfectly good and great standalone game but … Maybe I’m just biased because I truly enjoyed and liked Limbo on the 360 back in the day but … Toby’s truly trapped in the shadow of Limbo.\nAgain I truly might be biased because I compare it the entire time to Limbo but I seriously can’t help it. It just looks and feels and plays way too similar.\nIt’s still a decent game and worth it your time.\nEspecially when you’re longing for something like Limbo. It really doesn’t get better than this.","October 20, 2015","true","6.7"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","22","39","0","0"

Its true it has a similar look to Limbo which was definitely one of the creators inspirations.\n\nIn the 3 hours it took me to finish the game on a live twitch stream there were a number of people who popped in and asked if it as a successor to Limbo. This to me is a great compliment as Limbo was an amazing game.\n\nToby however is a very good game in its own right. The game was created by a Solo developer along with freelance artist and musician. The art style is great and I never got tired of the splat sounds when I died.\n\nThe controls could have been a little easier to handle at times and how I had hoped for a sprint button. Some of the timed puzzle type sections can be incredibly frustrating and I would imagine (based on comments from my viewers tonight) that plenty of patience is needed. I personally like my platform games to be a challenge, it adds so much to the satisfaction of beating a level knowing it was tough.\n\nThe game also shows your death counter on the title screen or at least I think it was a death counter. This informed me that Toby died 227 times in the 3 hours my playthrough took.\n\nI would definitely make Toby die a lot more times..","October 21, 2015","true","5.0"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

The graphics are similar to Limbo, but even more smooth and spectacular, with lense flares, flying leaves, bees and many other small details that create an unique atmosphere. There are also different background themes, such as mine, factory or snowy mountains - there's no way to be bored. Music might be a bit too cheerful for such dark setting, but it's quite pleasant to listen to.\n\nIt plays almost exactly as Limbo with the addition of simple riddles - most of which are quite easy to beat, even if you're tired. There is one puzzle in the game, however, that is really frustrating. You can find the solution here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkKTi_waZDo\nOther than that - they're fun.\n\nPlatforming elements are fun as well, but don't expect anything new or creative - it's the same stuff you've seen in other games, but nicely arranged. There are secret areas, dangerous and complex traps featuring spikes, saws, lasers and monsters, some hard moments that require perfect timing, even levels that you spend inside a mining cart. Difficulty level is low at first, but it gets really hard towards the end. You  die a lot and have to learn from your mistakes. What doesn't work as it should is character movement. The hero is just too slow, which makes improvising in tricky situations almost impossible to perform. The game is also a bit too short for my taste  - it took me around 3 hours to beat it with 100% score.\n\nBe aware that Toby: The Secret Mine has been created by 4 people but it doesnt feel low budget at all. It's really hard to believe, and much appreciated, that such small team managed to develop a game with such high production values on their own. If you like challenging (but not frustrating) platformers and the visual style of Limbo - you'll have a lot of fun with Toby.","October 20, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","0"

It surpassed my expectations for how much fun I would have playing it.\n\nFirst Impressions Video","October 26, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though the goal seems quite simple the challenging parkour and balanced puzzles  made it a lot of fun. For me personally the art style really gave the game an awesome feel and I can’t think of a better looking indie title. However if art is not your main interest then still I would conclude that the game is worth playing. The gameplay is very addictive and yet doesn’t get boring. Every level brings something new to the table. If there is one game I would suggest to my friends it would be this incredible indie title. So my parting words will be Pretty and puzzling and a real adventure.","October 26, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it has it's own unique characters, "story", artwork, challenges, and puzzles, it definitely borrows things from the games it's inspired by.  Dark and shadowy artwork, traps that will slaughter you for one wrong move, being thrown into the action, and, of course, the dialog is all borrowed from Limbo.  (The dialog, of course, not existing!)  If you enjoyed either of the games which inspired this one, Limbo or Nihilumbra, you should grab this up quickly and enjoy.  If you weren't a fan, then I'd say pass.  All that being said, what exactly is Toby: The Secret Mine?\n\nWell, it's a side-scrolling, action, puzzle-platformer, set in a dark, shadowy world.  Apparently, your people have been captured and you are Toby and you are tired of waiting for a hero to save them.  Good luck and enjoy your many deaths!    Oh and for the record, despite the frustration of failing at platforming games more times than not (okay I struggle a lot, but usually managed to headbutt my way through them) I still highly recommend this game and have to say I'm blown away that it was all done by just a single person!

The overall look of the game is very pleasing to the eye..but still mysterious, when I first started playing, I didnt expect much but a clone.. thats where I messed up. This game stands on its own and does a few things a little different.\n\nInstead of being "NES" hard. The game is fairly easy to play and some of the puzzles arent very tough at all. That doesnt mean the game wont keep you on your toes or the edge of your seat.. I didnt get to finish it yet, but got far enough to write a simple review.\n\nYes, the puzzles may be a little easy, but the platforming parts can be hard and very trick. not only do you have to leap gaps and such, but you also have to dodge enemy attacks. The attacking enemy is always at arms reach. We never understand what it is, or why it captured all of your friends.. but freeing them and staying alive seems to be the mission at hand.\n\nAlthough the game has a very dark foreground, the backgrounds are very bright and colorful and the lighting effects they use add a nice little touch to add to the immersion.\n\n( I was given a key to this game, not paid to play it.. and nothing can sway what I say anyway..Everything I review is with a no BS attitude )\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QIcuF5DxhI","November 3, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nice visuals and responsive controls make this a decent platformer. I'm going to be critical in the rest of the review not because I think the game is bad, but because I think the game had a bigger potential and could have been a lot better.\nFirst, the story. There is a hero and a bad guy. The hero beats the bad guy. The end... That's pathetic. Atmospheric indie games have a great opportunity to tell an interesting story - like Thomas Was Alone - or even something abstract - like Limbo or, more recently, Hero of Many. Instead, this game offers nothing.\nThe difficulty is mostly ok thanks to dense checkpoints. Yet the game can be still very frustrating because of its trial&error nature. Many hazards are barely indicated resulting in a lot of cheap deaths while you're trying to memorize the level. This moves the game away from Limbo to Super Meat Boy territory and I do not appreciate that.\nGame mechanisms are well executed but very unoriginal. Boxes, switches, elevators, lasers, I've seen that in too many other games before. There are some really cool parts, like the one where you hide from a dog-beast but these are too few.\nThe game is quite short. I have died 200 times and still I have finished it in two and half hours. Yes I haven't finished the last achievement - rescuing all your friends. But the game doesn't indicate which maps should I search and I'm not going to search the whole game over and over. Patch this, put some indicators on the map and I'll come back.Overall, it's really not a bad game. It's short, unoriginal and frustrating at times but still it was fun to play. But please keep in mind I have bought it on a sale for 5€. Not sure if it's worth the full price.","March 21","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very short for $10 at around 2 hours to complete the whole thing, but if you enjoyed Limbo and can pick it up on sale I'd recommend it.","January 30","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Puzzles are clever and fun, but fairly infrequent. Jumping is the single mechanic you have and it doesn't feel good. Lastly, most punishing platformers like this make death interesting/entertainment in some way to make up for the frequency.  However, it's not interesting in this game. A lot of times it's obfuscated by the world element that killed you.\n\nI think there's potential here for something good, but as it stands I'm not having fun.","January 30","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also why there are no sound/music options in game? WTF ? Also stupid puzzle inside - most without any real visual clue. This game is worth 3-4 usd at most at not ten ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bucks..","April 24","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well I would say, that if you'r reading this, you found it... Toby is chellenging, but not frustratig and that is good. You will have fun playing it, if you like platformers and exploring environments... Only thing I would complain about is that some of the secret map spots are more hidden, then they sould be...\n\n8.9/10","April 25","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The dark textures are reminiscent of limbo but the game itself has a unique character.  The only real issue I had regarding game play was that the textures are not always clearly defined but that also made it more challenging.  It’s definitely worth a play through; although it may not have amazing replay value.","May 22","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
