I've had it for a long time in physical format, but due to it's drm it's unplayable on modern systems, so I bought the steam version. I was a bit afraid of how it would run based on some of the reviews that have reported problems, so I was ready to issue a steam refund just in case.\n\nSo here's the score: this game is flawless. I've seen some negative reviews and let me address some of them. First of all, all those who say it's unplayable with keyboard and mouse are idiots, no two ways about it. You control your speed via the mouse wheel. It's that simple. Besides, you can customize the controls to your heart's content. Second off, no, it doesn't have checkpoints. And you know why? Because it doesn't need them! It has a quicksave function! I swear, some people...\n\nHow about the game itself? It's the best stealth game of all time. Period. You have full feedback of how much noise you make and how much noise is in the environment, how visible you are, you get a lot of tools for dispatching or distracting your enemies, you have nightvision, thermal vision and even "electric" vision that let's you see objects that use electricity (useful when completing some of the objectives). It has a fairly intelligent AI. The game is a bit too easy if you just kill everyone in my opinion but it's damn fun. If you like the suspense of stealth, look no further.\n\nThe graphics still hold up to this day in my opinion. Some of the round objects are a bit angular, but it doesn't take me out of the experience, and the textures still look great. There's also a surprising ammount of color that, compared to a lot of modern games, are a breath of fresh air. The sound design is superb and the soundtrack just ups the suspense. The music is low key and dynamic, changing to the gameplay.\n\nSome of the writing is a bit too convoluted for me. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but it's hard to follow, especially for the first time playing. You really have to invest your brain into the story or you'll get lost in it.\n\nAll in all, if you even remotely like stealth games don't you dare miss out on this one.","June 18, 2015","true","11.5"," 141 of 146 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","141","146","3","1"

Chaos Theory has 3 complete modes in single-player, co-op, and versus, at the time of its release very unique. In particular, the Spies vs. Mercs multi-player was an insanely fun and revolutionary experience, that for some strange reason Ubisoft has never replicated in later titles. Unfortunately, the co-op and versus modes are dead online, so the only real content purchasing it now is in single-player.\n\nIf you buy the game now, you're buying it only for the single-player experience. Still worthwhile in my opinion, but if you're looking for some multiplayer action, you're better off looking at the newest title (Blacklist at the time of writing).","November 27, 2013","true","4.4"," 117 of 128 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","117","128","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeavyIsSandvich/recommended/13570/","HeavyIsSandvich","BluPhoenix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeavyIsSandvich/","172 products in account","Let me specify something- for 8 years, this has been my favorite game of all time. I played the absolute ♥♥♥♥ out of the xbox version of it- and while it may feel more suited to a controller, it can be handled just as well on a mouse and keyboard (though you may want to bind the keys to your liking). Since there's less of them- we'll start with the bad things, shall we?\n\nStealth games NEED good, balanced cpu opponents. While the game gets the awareness of guards correct on a standard basis- the dudes you're sneaking past can be remarkably stupid, and occasionally even the converse of that, as it has its faults sometimes with twitchy/schizophrenic AI.\n\nThe character models' faces can be REALLY ugly. Mainly, that comes from stretching in an exaggerated expression, as grabbing someone and holding a knife to their neck raises their eyebrows roughly 3 feet above their face, and their mouths even wider than the area aforementioned. Their eyelids are also triangles.\n\nAnother fault for the PC version is that it doesn't quite have the sound design that the xbox version did- sound effects don't fade and echo like they should. Which is kind of bizarre! It's not often that the console counterpart ends up sounding better than PC master race's version.\n\nThere are a few issues in the multiplayer modes:\n\nCo-op\n-Game can desync and completely ♥♥♥♥ up a mission that you and your partner had spent an hour on\n-Framerate is LOCKED TO 30 FRAMES FOR SYNCHRONIZATION PURPOSES\n-This game absolutely hates when you Alt+Tab and will kick you off the server for doing it too much\n\nVersus\n-Opens separate program\n-Completely different (and less visually appealing) engine\n-Resolutions only offered in 4:3 format (but can be easily fixed by editing default.ini)\n-Some of the maps are so huge it boggles your ♥♥♥♥ing mind that ubi thought only 4 players could support it\n\nNow then- I've told you what isn't so hot about the game, and if all of that turns you off, that's okay.\n\nSo what makes Chaos Theory so great?\n\nMake no mistake, gameplay is the breading AND the frosting on this delicious cake. The engine is completely revamped from its' predecessors, which is a magical thing that they were able to tear down what they had before that was already superb, and make something that is nearly perfect. There's a new sound meter, that lets you take a look at just how noisy you are in a situation, which makes for a better sense of immersion- rather than LOUD/NOT LOUD. The new engine the game runs on feels substantially smoother than SC or Pandora Tomorrow (which is still yet to see a steam release); All of your actions, as well as the AI's, both look and feel realistic. There's no half-hearted spring step like the original, nor do guards have to hug walls to get past eachother. All you have to worry about is coming up with the method to either stun your foe, eliminate him, or how to slip past him unnoticed. I often prefer the latter, but when in co-op, you can't really trust your partner, nor yourself to be this stealthy. You're better off quick-saving frequently or just knocking out whomever you encounter (or both!).\n\nSound-wise, the game sounds awesome. Stellar voice acting, great sound effects, and some of the greatest music in a game ever. In fact, Ubisoft was so pleased by composer Amon Tobin's work, they released the soundtrack a MONTH before the game was due. Tobin was able to create the tense atmosphere of the game, all while retaining the feel that you're a ghost's shadow. You ARE what goes bump in the night. Needless to say, the game's OST has wound up on every different generation of an MP3 player I've had.\n\nSeriously. Just listen to it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SzhjG6OkvI\n\nThe voices in the game sound smooth and believable at every time. There's no forced lines like there were in Pandora Tomorrow, where there was that occasional young voice in the ambient audio tracks that absolutely did not fit the bill for the lines or the character he was given.\n\n"DON'T SHOOT, I'M AMERICAN"\n\nThat line is going to haunt me til the day I die.\n\nLike I've explained before, the game still looks nice, visually. The environments look polished, with the lights shining in just the right spots that make the game still a pleasure to look at, nearly a decade after release. The character models are very nicely detailed in terms of both texture, and shape. With bumps and edges on not just their faces, but clothing as well. In a game about stealth, you could imagine how important shadows and lighting are- and the balancing of the light-index along with the visuals work great (although this excludes a few particular downloadable co-op levels). The Co-op looks just like the Singleplayer, and doesn't sacrifice the engine for the sake of performance. But the extra levels included in the v1.05 patch leave a LOT to be desired. It feels like there was a completely different designer who had absolutely no spatial awareness, and didn't even understand how lighting works- and that large, stretched blood textures serve no purpose when there is no body they are connected to. Stay away from those maps if you wish not for your partner and yourself to succumb to occular leprosy.\n\nHow do I love thee, Versus? Let me count the ways.\n1. When I grabbed parker and threw him off a ledge, breaking his neck.\n2. Charging into and scaring the ♥♥♥♥ out of Binary_2 right after the elevator doors opened on 'Club House'.\n3. Both Parker and I getting killed after bd648 fired a grenade into the rafters, taking the ceiling along with it.\n4. wwchicken running headlong into yet another proximity mine next to the VIDEO GAMES terminal in 'River Mall'.\n\nVersus makes its' return from Pandora Tomorrow, and with a vengeance. Gameplay is considerably more balanced, providing an easier challenge for the mercs. Mercs can now hit spies in the FACE, and knock them down- which levels the playing field, since spies have a tendency to sneak up and break your neck. You can also customize your loadouts for both classes, which is nice when you're trying to balance the game to fit your playstyle. Spies are still stuck with their shocker rifle, but mercs have the option to take either their default assault rifle, an SMG, or a shotgun. There's various things you can use on both sides as well, including spy traps, tracking bullets, and even stealth camouflage. It's all there, and it's a blast to play. I have no idea why there's so few people playing such a fantastic game. I mean, Counterstrike came out 13 years ago, and it's still one of the most played games on Steam.\n\nWhere is the JUSTICE.\n\nTL;DR This game is fun as hell. If you haven't played it, and you love to be a stealthy SOB, get your hands on this delicious classic. Don't care about the multiplayer/ have no friends? The singleplayer tells a great story that can be beaten anywhere from 10-20 hours. A great deal that you can get on steam for an average 5-10 bucks. Wouldn't miss it for the world.\n\n-BP","November 28, 2013","true","34.6"," 107 of 118 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","107","118","0","2"

The combat is incredibly hard if you get into it, but not impossible to get out of. The fundamentals are in full play, from noise level, to line of sight, to light levels, and gadgets that make your life a little easier.\nThis game covers it all.\nIf you can bring a friend in, do so, the coop campaign is still one of the finest in a long time (it has quick saves and mutual player pausing, and not crap netcode, something games today can't get right), and although the multiplayer is dead, I've heard nothing but good things about spies versus mercs.\nSigning up for coop may be a pain (unless you have a Uplay account, they seem to work off the same servers, oddly), but native 1080p support in a game this old and a lighting system that puts many modern games to shame more than makes up for any technical shortcomings this game might have for you.","October 19, 2013","true","56.6"," 60 of 66 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","60","66","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SoulDestroy/recommended/13570/","SoulDestroy","SoulDestroy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SoulDestroy/","385 products in account","Rather than asking for twitch reflexes and an emphasis on mass murder, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory asks the player to be aware.\n\nThis is not a game where the locales are merely canvases to spill blood - every inch of ever level is laden with multiple ways to progress through the mission. Shadows, vents, windows, pipes and balconies which can be hung off of... not only are you given a wide array of ways to avoid enemy detection, but these assets can be used to silently (and stylishly) take out enemies.\n\nNot only does the environment give an incredible amount of replay-friendly playstyle options, but it also reeks of atmosphere and immersion in a way that I've never seen in a video game since. Not only are the dark, glistening graphics and ambient sounds well-done, but the moody soundtrack by Amon Tobin serves as the syrupy glaze to the atmospheric pancake. Meanwhile, the level design has a realistic feel to it, as though every hallway that you enter could be a real place.\n\nOverall, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is a gameplay masterpeice and a technical marvel that still impresses today, over ten years after its release. Almost every aspect has such a great level of polish that, despite the game's relatively niche genre, I reccomend this game to everyone who has ever picked up a game controller.","March 23, 2014","true","31.0"," 49 of 51 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","49","51","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/34240308/recommended/13570/","34240308","AutoMard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/34240308/","86 products in account",""Yeah, (I am) the real kind (of spy), not the tuxedo kind. I'm the kind that makes you bleed all over your Andretti unless you give me information."\n\nChaos Theory is a third-person stealth video game and the third installment in Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell series. It, again, puts you in the boots of NSA (and Third Echelon) special agent Sam Fisher as he undertakes missions around the world to avert the possibility of an all-out war between military superpowers.\n\nThe single-player campaign is divided into ten missions with locations ranging from the America's to East Asia. The game was released almost ten years back but it definitely holds well from a visual point of view. Missions usually take place at night (or in the dark) which probably help mask a few of the game's graphical deficiencies.\n\nChaos Theory has probably some of the best stealth mechanics in any game. A sliding light bar indicates whether Sam would be visible to the enemy or not while a noise bar shows how much noise is being produced as the protagonist moves around. Sam's pace of movement is tunable by scrolling the mouse-wheel, giving players a much greater control over how the character moves. Enemies can be sneaked upon from behind and knocked-out or put in the choke-hold to extract vital information. Apart from moving around in the shadows, the game provides you the option of traversing through vents, zip-lines, hang from ledges and overhead pipes; all the while avoiding enemy encounters.\n\nThe game is designed around stealth so players would experience gun fights to be clunky in nature. Apart from the usual arsenal of silenced pistol, sticky cameras. stun grenades and assault rifles, there's a very useful EMI feature that allows you to remotely disable lights and electronics temporarily. It helps a lot in moving around the environment unscathed. Hacking is a fundamental portion of the game. Computers, keypads and security terminals can be hacked, with the mechanic favouring those with quick reaction times. Multi-vision goggles are once again an essential part of gameplay with Sam able to alternate between night-vision, thermal and EMF modes.\n\nThe enemy AI is excellent with sentries coming to snoop around if they see open doors or turned-off lights. Enemies can also be distracted by whistling and flinging objects around the environment. Instances of direct combat are extremely rare but if such a scenario does crop up, enemies take cover and periodically change positions to improve their chances of winning gunfights.\n\nThe plot was interesting but not something that hasn't be done already or since. The script is well-written and character voice-overs are extremely well done (Michael Ironside ftw!). But I felt character interactions felt a bit too formal and serious. Mission briefs involve relevant characters droning off about mission objectives, although there's some fun banter between Sam and his handlers during missions; but that's few and far between. The game could've done with more cutscenes, in my opinion.\n\nChaos Theory is a definite recommendation if you're looking for a pure stealth experience. The SP campaign length is around 12-15 hours, subject to one's playing style of course. The game is definitely much much better than the p.o.s that was Splinter Cell: Conviction.","July 19, 2015","true","37.5"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","41","45","2","0"

The options to stealth or kill one's way through are actually present; unlike SOME games, with the right set-up I can get through 95% of SC:CT without killing anyone. If I do, whether on accident or on purpose, then I at least have the option of hiding the body or running away. Takedowns are similar, and the environment kills are nothing short of fantastic!\n\nSpeaking of - its environments still look gorgeous even on modern systems - even if the character models are less-so. And the sound design and soundtrack? Absolutely brilliant; a perfect mix of background noise and high-tension BGM makes me almost crap myself if I accidentally blow my cover and the alarms start going off.\n\nThe only downsides are that it may be difficult to run on some newer systems, and... well, not to spoil anything, but the last level was somewhat of a disappointment, as it turns into nothing short of a bloodbath, despite all my efforts to prevent that from happening. As well, it may be problematic to get used to the controls (it took me a few hours of play before I got them down), but once you do it becomes less of an issue.\n\nOverall, for anyone interested in a true stealth game and not just a short break from running and gunning, this is a must-have.","November 10, 2014","true","26.5"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","30","31","0","4"

You won't track the time spend on it, but who cares about that?\n\nNow my review about Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory... That's a long ♥♥♥ name for a video game!\n\nWhen you think about stealth games, a few names come to mind: Hitman, Thief, Splinter Cell and MGS to an extent.\nHailed as the best games in the series most of the time, this review is based on a game I consider to be the pinnacle in that genre, along with Hitman Blood Money.\n\nFirst of all, don't let the release date fool you. Chaos Theory hasn't aged one bit. It still looks good today, the mechanics are still top notch and mostly, it has tons of features you'd expect from a modern game, without all the flaws you can guess.\n\nI don't know if it's just me, but stealth in FPS view always felt awkward and unpractical to me. Good thing this one has a third person view, have fun looking behind walls! It also features various ways to kill/knock out: whether you'd rather do it in close-combat, shoot them from a distance, pull them from a platform or even jumping onto them.\n\nThe environments are a bit varied, going from a jungle-like maze to the top of a lighthouse, cracking down the vault of the bank or retrieve information in city full of people not knowing any better... or even a god damn submarine if that's what you like. Granted, it's mostly close-quarters.\n\nStorywise, it's nothing revolutionnary but it fits well. You follow a linear line up to the bad guys and get em down one by one up until the end. Politicals, bureaucrats, bankers... they all wanted a piece of that cake.\n\nThe OST ranges from forgettable to annoying, especially when you do a quick takedown and have to stand a minute or so of "ACTION MUSIC" for no reason. If there's one downside to the game, this may as well be the one. Nothing too irritating but it certainly ain't the soundtrack of Hitman: Blood Money.\n\nThough the game is a rather serious one (shouldn't come up as a surprise considering the protagonist is named Sam), I can garantee you a handful of chuckles to be had. Whether it comes from a stupid mistake you did and alerted all the guards, or one of those on the verge of wetting his pants while being interrogated with a huge knife up his throat.\n\nSO DO I RECOMMEND THIS GAME? YOU BET YOUR ♥♥♥ I DO! Did I mention it also features a COOP CAMPAIGN?\nIt lacks one thing though. Uplay isn't there. Oh wait that's a good thing!","October 15, 2015","true","0.3"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","34","39","7","0"

Nonetheless, Sam Fisher is a character you'll find easy to like, and can make you crack a smile.\nWhen it comes to gameplay, it's kinda frightnening to notice how rigid it is, how the game got old. It gives you everything you would expect for a good stealth game, a lot of possibilities, some alternate routes, and a heavy dose of "waiting in the shadows hoping for that guy not to see you".\nGraphics-wise, it's holding up. When the game came out, it was one of the most beautiful thing I had laid my eyes on, it really blew me.

I'll try.\n-I have to constantly remind myself that this was an Xbox (gen 6) game, because it looks better than half the game that come out today. Look up the forums for some sweet graphic improvements as well, It looks absolutely stunning on my rig at 1440p.\n-The controls and interface have been perfected, enemies are smart and have a great deal of dialogue, and the story is amazing because this was from back in a day when having "Tom Clancy's" before your title actually meant something.\n-Going 100% Ghost is super satisfying, but the game also has moments where it's hard NOT to want to kill the enemies your facing when you see what they are up to. That's part of the job I guess, you have to put personal feelings aside\n-If Ubisoft wants to make SC7 a Game of the Year again, all they have to do is thoroughly go back through CT, recreate those same mechanics, and start the rest from there.

Walsh (CG-80), to the Yellow Sea with the hopes that China and North Korea will back down at its presence."\n\nIf you are into Stealth Games...what am I saying...even if you're not, try it out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/recommended/13570/","Spartan717","Echo419","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/","507 products in account","Perfect stealth game\n\nChaos theory is the best splinter cell game and arguably one of the best stealth games ever created.\n\nThe story is somewhat realistic and interesting. Tensions are running high as North Korea is threatening an all out war against America and her allies. You play as Sam Fisher, an ex-SEAL member now a 'cell' (spy) working for the a top secret sub-branch within the National Security Agency (NSA). It's your job to uncover who is behind jeopardising the relationship between the two countries and risking all out war.\n\nThe gameplay is the best component of the game. Before each mission you get a briefing with other members of Third Eschalon and their allies telling you the task and situation of the mission. You then get to select your loadout based on 'Stealth' (more stealth equipment like smoke grenades and sticky cameras), 'Assault' (More assault rifle ammo and frag grenades) or 'Reddington' (Mixture of the other two) which affects the types of equipment you will have and how much of each item you carry with you. The three options of equipment speak for themselves on how you want to approach the mission. The equipment you may have include the sileneced assault rifle, silenced pistol, sticky cameras, smoke grenades, stun grenades, frags etc. The objectives in each mission will generally require you to steal, sabotage or eliminate a target. As a 'splinter cell game' stealth gameplay is highly recommended. Besides hiding in the shadows, a new element plays a role in in the gameplay, noise. Creating too much noise (more than the ambient sound in the area which is indicated by a bar on your hud) will now cause foes to detect you which may include gun noises, broken glass and movement. As such, you can control your walking speed (which increases noise as it increases) via the scrolling the mouse wheel. The final element to the gameply is manipulating electronics via your pistol. By aiming your pistol and pressing right mouse button you can turn off an electronic device for a few seconds. The purpose of this is to not destroy the item and hence, alerting the gaurds. You can go all guns blazing in most of the missions, but this is not recommended as it not only ruins the atmosphere of the game, but you  die very quickly in frontal combat. As per usual you can eliminate gaurd using lethal force or non-lethal force. Shooting gaurds is lethal as well as choosing the lethal option when grabing them from behind. Non-lethal involves choosing non-lethal ammo and knocking gaurds out after grabbing them. Another new element to the gampley is the ability to quickly walk up to gaurds and knock them out/kill them, which helps when your about to be spotted at close range.\n\nThe level design is excellent. Each level is big and unique, spotting plenty of places places to hide in such as shadows. Furthermore, there are more than one route to reach objectives including vents, doors, tunnels etc. The graphics has also aged well and looks pleasant. Finally the levels are so well designed that you can go through the entire game without killing/knocking out anyone and not being detected either.\n\nThe audio is good. Voice actors (especially Sam) do a great job at instilling the emotions of the current situation. Weapon sound are also good as well. Each level has a unique track that is played while stealthed and while being spotted. Each level has a unique soundtrack for the the previous two situations, so you won't get bored from hearing the same tarck over and over again.\n\nIf you want one of the best stealth games ever made, chaos theory will not dissapoint you.","February 17, 2015","true","17.7"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

This was arguably the last good Splinter Cell game depending on how you feel about Double Agent and one of the last passable games with Tom Clancy's name plastered on it for licensing shekels.\n\nStill holds up despite being over ten years old, the KB/M controls work fine but you should probably invest in a controller for this one because using the scroll wheel to control your walking speed is like letting a mouse trap clamp down on your nipples in sub-zero temperatures. Multiplayer still works natively on PC as far as I know and it beats Konami's Pachinko Gear Cashcow: Online any day. Co-Op campaign is great and had an interesting mechanic if you're using a microphone to distract guards, unfortunately unless you're still using Windows XP in-game voice chat doesn't work so you'll probably never use it.\n\nOverall its still one of the best stealth games out there. Support team banter thats self-aware and doesn't take itself too seriously despite the shlocky 'political intrigue' storyline thats in every TC game, great missions with multiple approaches, fantastic competitive multiplayer and co-operative campaign. If only Ubisoft still gave a damn about the quality of their products.","March 10","true","4.6"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","16","17","5","0"

Even if you have not tried or played many games in the genre, this would be a fantastic one to start with.\nI haven't even tried co-op or Versus yet but the singleplayer experience is easily above any other Splinter Cell out there and in general is one of the most engaging ones I've played through. The level design, environments, sound direction... everything about the single player is spot on. Hearing the enemies talk to themselves as you creep around with the phenomenal soundtrack really gets you pumped.\nThis is a big step up from the previous two titles. In my opinion, all the other future SC titles strayed too much from its original playstyle and feel, especially at Conviction and Blacklist. While those may appeal more to some people, and may be great games in their own right, they do not come close to offering the most 'Splinter Cell-like' experience as they focus a little more on action.\nIf you're looking for a great stealth game to play try this one out.

I am a hardcore SC fan, and if you are on edge about getting involved in this franchise and don't want to spend the money on the newest installments without knowing what they are like. Choas Theory is the way to go. This game is new enough the graphics won't drive you nuts, and if you like stealth/action with lots of options for sneaking past or eliminating targets. This is the starting point for you. After you play this, you'll definately want the Conviction and Blacklist follow up games, and who knows maybe you'll say "screw the graphics, I wanna know more about this guys story" and go back to SC one and follow the whole story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/13570/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","This is considered my favorite game of all time, and to make sure I have your attention now I'll tell you why :\n\n-Awesome storyline\n-Chaos theory has the best multiplayer of any splinter cell\n-There are co-op missions that me and my cousin spent countless hours on (unfortunately the PC port doesn't have it... for some dumb reason).\n-The gameplay is amazing as there is never one way to get through a scenario\n-The graphics are still relevant to today's high tech world\n\nNow the detailed explanation.\n\nThe storyline is epic. Why is it epic? Splinter cell series has always been known to have a crazy or sort of conspiracy storyline, chaos theory delivers a lot more than that. Two lead programmers that cracked Philippe Masse's kernals from the first splinter cell have enhanced his algorithms and now could be used for any electronic warfare, be it military or economic. One of these programmers is discovered dead early in the game, and the other one on the loose... the story just begins to exponentially get better from there.\n\nThe multiplayer was my favorite in this game as it gave me everything I wanted. I want to play online ... okay go ahead. I want to play with my friend on the same screen or at my house and he at his... fine go ahead. Want to play competitively as a spy? Fine. Want to play as a guard and take down spies with a first person view.... heck the devs cared so much they did this too. When someone really gives an effort to really allow any sort of play when it comes to multiplayer, it's greatly appreciated.\n\nI would say the gameplay of this game is arguably the best type out there. The physics/engine in this one is what would one expect from a third game of the series. I would argue that still to this day even though there are other Splinter Cell's out there, this one still has the best game engine. The soft body touches, the noise system, throwing of objects to make noise, ability to whistle, use the SC-20K it's sniping/assault attachment or it's launcher attachments, the grenade types (frag, flash, smoke), the three different goggle settings (heat, night vision, ECM), ability to either knock out or kill an opponent... there's quite a bit of things to mention. I like the fact you are given a choice of going through vents or alternate ways to avoid conflict or can go through conflict, or one by one slowly "put to sleep and hide the bodies" conflict. The greatest improvement though compared to the first splinter cell is that there is flexibility in the proximity system. When one is close to the enemy, they don't ultimately see/feel you just because they walked past you going through a doorway. This game is fantastic in how you are able to knock someone out or kill someone before they can react. This was a major breakthrough in the series.\n\nHow are the graphics still good for an original x-box game? Well how's 1980X1080 sound? Probably the best we can get unless someone goes through the entire game and re-does it... but there wouldn't be much to redo. The cut scenes are still awesome, and the game play graphics are just as good as any game. You will not have an issue with graphics playing this. Sounds? Pshhh, probably the best of the series as well. Everything sounds accurate from gun shots to dialogue. Listen carefully to hear Sam make remarks as he moves about or the guards talking about some random topic.\n\nI would highly recommend this game, on sale or not as it is still to this day my favorite game. I'm not being biased in my rating as it being my favorite game, but this game is what took the gaming industry to another level. Thief, Assassins Creed or any of that wouldn't have been without Splinter Cell.\n\nRocksolid 9.5/10.\n\nGameplay	A+	Story / Campaign	A	Visuals / User Interface	B+	Sounds / Music	A-	Replay-ability	B+	Overall 	A\nPS - Because I didn't know where to fit this - relevant characters from cutscenes also breif you before going on a misison on top of team members of the echelon. Not only that, Michael Ironside does the voice of Sam Fisher with perfection. He literally is Sam Fisher and makes the series what it is. The guy who played Fisher in conviction just stunk up the joint.","September 8, 2014","true","13.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

Not to mention the game's unbelievable audio where in some instances the ambiance can actually mask the player's sound allowing for even richer gameplay.

You will occasionally be lockpicking doors, hacking, hiding bodies, interrogating enemies, etc. Killing isn't a necessity to progress, either. Feel free to speedrun through (most) levels as a pacifist!\n\nGraphical Fidelity - DirectX Support, Overall QualityThere are several video options regarding quality. It supports HDR, Shader Model 3.0, Anisotrophic Filtering, Anti-Aliasing, and such. This includes widescreen-monitor support as well. Unfortunately, Versus Mode is completely different - locked at 30 frames, only supports DirectX 8, no 16:9/16:10 ratio support, various missing or unincluded game options, and overall a huge disadvantage. It is most similiar to Pandora Tomorrow in terms of quality and gameplay elements.\n\nThe Community - Servers, GamespyMy only problem with the game that remains is the lack of players. The modding community on the other hand is still fairly active. In another note, Gamespy servers have been long since shut down, and much of the fanbase has moved on, especially after Splinter Cell: Blacklist was released in 2013. You will likely notice less than 15 players a day in Versus lobbies, and an even smaller number of players in CO-OP lobbies. I recommend bringing some friends along to ease the stress of waiting and finding more games to join.\n\nFinal Rating - What It DeservesThe game deserves my overall 9/10 rating. I've never given a game such a high rating, and my expectations have always been rather high for most games. It's worth it. Bear in mind that it isn't perfect, and it still has it's fair share of issues to this day. But it is *the* perfect stealth game.","November 26, 2014","true","89.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

The AI looks way more inteligent, and we got some new moves and toys.\n\nGameplay Rating: 3/5\n\nEngineUnreal Engine 2.5\n\nGraphics Options\nFor a 2005 game it's impressive this game has widescreen support, and it scales nicely. We have have access to pixel shader options (something even modern games don't have), we can change between pixel shader 1, 2 and 3, meaning it supports a huge variety of GPUs.\n\nThe developers disabled the console and windowed mode for some unknown reason.\n\nGraphics Quality\nThe game suffered a huge improvement in graphics compared to the previous title, the animations are awful though, the first game had way better animations.\n\nPerformance\nPerformance is solid, a toaster can run this game.\n\nEngine Rating: 3/5\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10\n\nNotesOverall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and engine (how the game looks and runs).

Easily the best in the Splinter Cell series, this is in my top 5 favorite games ever. Every element this game aims for, it achieves perfectly. The graphics are amazing for the time, the gameplay is fantastic and requires patience and skill, and the map design actually allows some exploration but keeps things focused. It's pretty laughable at times when it drops dates "this is 2008... the future!" but as a game it works unbelievably well. It's the most balanced when it comes to combat vs stealth, in that it's very realistic in how it handles it. If someone catches you off guard, they can kill you pretty much instantly, but the same goes for all the enemies.\n\nPlaying the newer installments, it's sad how simple they've become. It's not a simple "it's new so it sucks thing", this one is better than the older installments. It has just the right balance of skill requirement vs being accessible and holds up the best. You have to manage how well you're lit up or how loud you are compared to the environment masking your footsteps, but it's easy to do and incredibly rewarding once you master it. Some games like the Hitman series or the newer Splinter Cell installments don't really do the stealth elements well enough to really get into it, but this game achieves it perfectly. You do need to stay hidden but it's fun and worth it to get that badass feeling of coming out of the shadows with your knife, or whistling to get a guards attention and snap his neck from a pipe above as he nears you. Co-op missions are decent if you have a friend to play it with, but the story mode is the main focus as it should be. The soundtrack, dark visuals, and excellent stealth gameplay are just amazing. If you're into stealth games especially, I recommend this. It isn't an action shooter.","January 31, 2014","true","29.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Splinter Cell is another stealth game that helped redefine the stealth genre in gaming.  This game will make your palms sweat as you sneak your way through each mission.  The controls are nice, textures and lighting is great, and voice acting is amazing.  Micheal Ironside really knows how to keep the players entertained.\n\nAfter the campaign, you have two extra modes to play around in.  You have a Co-Op mode, and a Multiplayer mode. I recommend playing the Co-Op first before the MP since it helps evolve the campaign.

It doesn't have the same "badass" feel as Conviction, but here you're more about NOT BEING SEEN than looking cool.\n\nThe game is mission-based and although each mission has several objectives, only the primary ones are needed to complete the mission.  How you complete your mission is very open-ended and there are often multiple paths and ways of doing things.  You can be as ruthless as you want, deciding whether or not to kill people (or simply avoid them entirely).\n\nDespite having been released in 2005, the game still looks impressive.  The controls are complex and some people might have a learning curve to get over, but please stick with it. Unlike lots of more recent games, Chaos Theory allows you to not only save (both manual and quick saves) whenever and wherever you want, but name them as well.\n\nAll in all, I suggest playing it if you like stealth games.  If not, don't bother.","December 28, 2011","true","43.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'm a huge fan of stealth games.  Chaos Theory came out near the end of what I like to call the Golden Age of Stealth games and it still holds up today, for the most part.  Story wise the game is lacking, which is one of the reasons I would rank Choas Theory under games like Metal Gear Solid 3.  The graphics aren't great even for a game that came out in 2005.  Enemy AI is decent for the most part, but their imposibly quick reaction time to spotting you can be frustrating.  Somtimes if you bump into an enemy or are somehow spotted they will immediately start firing, as in no animation of them turning around or rasing their gun, just immediatly firing.  Apart from that the AI is decent. Mechanincally it's a phenomenal stealth game worthy of the genere.  There are light and sound indicators telling you how visibil you are or how much noise your making, it even tells you the noice level at which the enemy will hear you.  Unlike recent releases in the franchise, Chaos Theory isn't a game you can approach with guns blazing.  You actually have to use stealth.  You can't fire from the hip and you have to pull your gun out every time you want to fire which decreases your movement speed significantly.  The PC version runs fine on modern systems, I had very few problems, and the game supports 1920x1080 without having to mod the game(old titles tend to be hit or miss with resolution support).  If you have a high refresh rate monitor like I do you should know that the game is locked at 100 FPS.  Keyboard and Mouse work fine, but it doesn't have controller support like most title now do, so you'll have to figit with it if you want to use a controller.\n\nStory Score: 6/10\n\nRest of the Game Score: 9/10","October 25, 2014","true","5.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/inferno986return/recommended/13570/","inferno986return","inferno986return","http://steamcommunity.com/id/inferno986return/","732 products in account","Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is an amazing game and instantly worth a recommend if you are a fan of the stealth genre or just like the series and haven't gotten into the 3rd instalment for some reason. It's worthy of its Steam-tag "Best in the series". I have debated with myself about it, but I would add this game to one of my favourite games of all-time. No, I am not a huge stealth enthusiast. Also being a legacy title, it doesn't have any UPlay integration at all!\n\nA good stealth game is dependant on solid mechanics and unlike later instalments of Splinter Cell. Chaos Theory and its predecessors are mostly stealth driven games.  Sam Fisher is given 3 settings in his trademark 3-scope goggles (Night-Vision, Heat-Vision and an EEV mode which highlights electronic equipment),  an EMP function on his handgun and of course a knife.  The game also features  sound and light bars in the HUD to show how silent and hidden you are which is a nice touch. With these tools, some environmental manipulation and the solid controls it's possible to get through entire missions without being detected or firing a bullet. Infact in the 1st mission I got through with only firing 2 on normal difficulty.\n\nControls are excellent here on the PC with a keyboard & mouse. With the controls already premapped sensibly and are all rebindable.  A notable control mechanic is how you can alter Fisher's walking/sneaking speed via the scroll wheel of the mouse which is a really nice touch. The game does have a good tutorial which teaches you how to work with these efficiently.\n\nThe plot is worthy of the Tom Clancy name and is immensely detailed. I didn't understand it as a child in 2005 and I still only have a relative understanding of it now with some help from the Wiki and knowledge from previous playthroughs. It follows on from the previous 2 installments and takes you all around the world. That's the idea of the plot without mentioning spoilers.\n\nVisuals are from the Unreal Engine 2.5 and are pretty solid. The game is from 2005, so it's safe to say that the visuals are antiquated. The lighting plays a key role in the game as it can be the difference between having bullets hurled at Fisher. The textures are antiquated for the most part, but that's to be expected. Still it doesn't look too bad for a 2005 game.\n\nSoundtrack was composed by both Amon Tobin and the well-know Jesper Kyd. The OST is amazing and each tune has a unique vibe that sets the scene whether it be ambient whilst Sam Fisher is sneaking around or frantic when enemies are firing at you due to your carelessness. It was also apparently featured on the UK motoring TV show Top Gear which says quite a bit and my favourite tracks from El Cargo (the 2nd mission) have been part of my personal music library for quite some time.\n\nSo all in all give it a try. At its current price of £9.99 ($9.99/9.99€), it's not a bad deal for stealth enthusasts. Though it has been reduced by Ubisoft to at least 75% making it cost around £2.50, I would it's worth getting for most gamers.\n\nThat's all I can say about the game. If you want to know more there are a myriad of reviews out there. One which I think sums it up well is MrSnuggleDuck's review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6b1zcnD1vA&list=UUJ_LqSH_rj9agivyFGWlIvw&feature=c4-overview","February 24, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's in the Holy Trinity of stealth games, along with Thief 2 and Hitman Blood Money.\n\nGameplay: There's a light and dark stealth system, which means that staying in the dark is crucial to sneaking by. Some of the tensest moments are spent hiding in the dark while a guy with a huge gun is so close you can see his nosehairs. You can always see how visible you are and how much noise you are making in the HUD, which provides a lot of convienence. You can also use sounds in the enviorment to mask sounds you are making, like thunder. I recall one moment where you have to open a loud door in front of a sleeping guard, and if you don't open it while he's snoring, he'll wake up. You can also interrogate guards you've grabbed, and it leads to a lot of hilarious and memorable moments. The gadgets from Pandora Tomorrow make a return (the previous game in the series) while adding some new additions to Fisher's arsenal. The gameplay overall is tense and satisfying, and makes you feel like a badass spy.\n\nGraphics: The lighting system is brilliant, and looks better than most modern games. The character models, however, are lack luster. I remember one specific guard who's gums were light green. And Sam himself, when he's not wearing mask, has a consistent cross-eyed dumb look on his face. The textures are fine, not really anything special. It looks fine, overall.\n\nSound: When the absolutely kickass music isn't playing, there's atmospheric sounds and really sets the mood. The sound design of effects like footsteps rivals even the Thief games. The enemies have very stereotypical accents, and it's done for laughs. The music starting to play when an enemy is suspicous and is looking for you really kicks up the tension.\nThe sound design overall, is fantastic.\n\nLevel Design: There's usually at least one alternate way to get into an area (although it heavily relies on pipes and crawl spaces.) It's non-linear and sprawling (excluding the first level) and is fun to explore. The level design is great (while not anywhere near the masterful level design of the Thief games.)\n\nConclusion: Buy this game. If you're looking to get into stealth games, this is the game. One of the greatest games I've ever played.\nAnd I don't know why the enemies can't see the 3 suns on top of Fisher's head, shut up.","September 26, 2014","true","73.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

While I still feel like the controls could've been better, something I also feel about Double Agent, I enjoy the game immensely. The most obvious reason for the game is the story, which isn't "US vs. Russia". From what I can gather, it's North Korea.\n\nChaos Theory is also easily the best game in the series, according to the dozens of reviews by new fans and Splinter Cell veterans alike. I certainly would agree; stealth is paramount in any situation. Sam's suit comes with a variety of items to help you know when you're hidden, or when you've screwed the pooch. Light sensors to let you know when you're visible, sound detectors to let you know how slow you need to move to keep quiet. An option I'm familiar with because of Double Agent is the OPSAT, which is a real-time objectives and map menu, meaning you'll need to hide to use it effectively. Hacking is way more interesting than Double Agent, and shooting, when done right, feels like an accomplishment.\n\nGraphics wise, character models in game show visible age and are acceptable if you remember it's from 2005. Environments though show great lighting and attention to detail. I did get a feeling of being in the locations Sam visited. And again, for a game in 2005, it looks just as good as some games from this decade.\n\nSound is phenomanal, with a soundtrack by Amon Tobin and layered for different events in gameplay so it never feels stale. Sam Fisher is voiced by Michael Ironside; not the new guy who everyone hates for some ridiculous reason. Seriously guys, move on. In fact the voice acting and the script writing are good too; minus the enemy/foreign character voices. While Sam and his pals are witty and relatable, enemies tend to have such bad and stereotyped accents. And let's not forget the character "Long Dan". Turning on native voices solves this, but there's no subtitle option to let you know what's being said, so it's more for immersion after beating the game.\n\nSo yes, I'm joining the bandwagon. But at least it's a good one; Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is easily one of the best stealth games I've played. And it's one that really deserves it.","March 17, 2014","true","27.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Was one of my favourite games when it came out, not just in the stealth genre, but in general, it made the idea of sneaking around, and also not killing, fun.\n\nI cannot speak for multiplayer or coop, so please think of this as only a single player review.\n\nStory isn't the strongest point, but is still pretty good, nothing fancy. The gameplay is where the game shines. Intuitive controls and a good hud system to allow players to exploit their environment to the fullest, with a good balance of choices which allow the player to feel in control of Sam, despite linear and clear missions. You decide if you want to sneak, when to distract, what tools to use, from which direction to leap upon guards etc. I feel it's hard to put into words how the game manages to pull off beautifully many things, aiming for Sam to be a stealthy ninja, a predator, a covert operative with many tricks, moves and gadgets up his sleeve, which add up to a fun balance of power, not making the player feel too powerful (the difficulty isn't hard for this game, which isn't too offputting) but not too weak. AI has a variety of tricks, though it isn't anything mindblowing, it is still enough to remind the player that you better anticipate some pushback from the npcs.\nI think the campaign was short, I haven't played it through yet (again), but the length and replayability is still decent.\n\nGraphics are still highly enjoyable for an older game and has solid frames per second with highest settings. A proper mix of dynamic shadows, decent shaders and textures, solid animations and physics, allowed me to still immerse myself into the game without being distracted by too much unrealism. Doesn't mean you should expect the quality of modern games, but this game does enough, in my opinion, to still be eyecandy, the basic solid kind of candy, like milk chocolate.\nHappily reinstalling this game on my mediocre laptop, I didn't find many problems, which I were slightly expecting, due to so many, not merely old games, but newer ones also having so many problems (which can nevertheless be fixed in many cases). The major problem is that shader model 3 doesn't work for me, the screen goes white, but upon investigation I think it has more to do with the intel HD graphics card than the game, or my drivers anyway (SM2 is still good and looks good). My laptop is a win7, intel dual core 2gHz, 4gRAM with shared graphics card memory, dedicated only 64mb. So it might just work for the majority. I should add that I always add the admin rights and compatibility mode XPSP3 by habit, so that might also have had something to do with it.\n\nPeople who are not even fans of stealth games might find SCCT a luring gateway drug into the world of patient stalking and picking your own time when to pick npcs off one by one with satisfaction.","November 28, 2013","true","25.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Was one of my favourite games when it came out, not just in the stealth genre, but in general, it made the idea of sneaking around, and also not killing, fun.\n\nI cannot speak for multiplayer or coop, so please think of this as only a single player review.\n\nStory isn't the strongest point, but is still pretty good, nothing fancy. The gameplay is where the game shines. Intuitive controls and a good hud system to allow players to exploit their environment to the fullest, with a good balance of choices which allow the player to feel in control of Sam, despite linear and clear missions. You decide if you want to sneak, when to distract, what tools to use, from which direction to leap upon guards etc. I feel it's hard to put into words how the game manages to pull off beautifully many things, aiming for Sam to be a stealthy ninja, a predator, a covert operative with many tricks, moves and gadgets up his sleeve, which add up to a fun balance of power, not making the player feel too powerful (the difficulty isn't hard for this game, which isn't too offputting) but not too weak. AI has a variety of tricks, though it isn't anything mindblowing, it is still enough to remind the player that you better anticipate some pushback from the npcs.\nI think the campaign was short, I haven't played it through yet (again), but the length and replayability is still decent.\n\nGraphics are still highly enjoyable for an older game and has solid frames per second with highest settings. A proper mix of dynamic shadows, decent shaders and textures, solid animations and physics, allowed me to still immerse myself into the game without being distracted by too much unrealism. Doesn't mean you should expect the quality of modern games, but this game does enough, in my opinion, to still be eyecandy, the basic solid kind of candy, like milk chocolate.\nHappily reinstalling this game on my mediocre laptop, I didn't find many problems, which I were slightly expecting, due to so many, not merely old games, but newer ones also having so many problems (which can nevertheless be fixed in many cases). The major problem is that shader model 3 doesn't work for me, the screen goes white, but upon investigation I think it has more to do with the intel HD graphics card than the game, or my drivers anyway (SM2 is still good and looks good). My laptop is a win7, intel dual core 2gHz, 4gRAM with shared graphics card memory, dedicated only 64mb. So it might just work for the majority. I should add that I always add the admin rights and compatibility mode XPSP3 by habit, so that might also have had something to do with it.\n\nPeople who are not even fans of stealth games might find SCCT a luring gateway drug into the world of patient stalking and picking your own time when to pick npcs off one by one with satisfaction.","November 28, 2013","true","25.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It still holds up really well for being a game that came out on the original xbox. Taking your time and planning your movements is rewarding, while going in carelessly and killing people willy nilly will get you killed very quickly. I like that there is not only a meter to show how visible you are, but also a sound meter that is affected by your movement speed and ambient noises. My proudest achievement in gaming was getting 100% on every level without killing anyone and not being seen at all, leaving no trace.\n\nI don't know if co-op or multiplayer still works, but the co-op missions were great when I played them on the original xbox with my brother back in the day.","May 26","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like a lot of series, the second game is often the best. It perfected the system of the first, and it hasn't gone downhill yet. Kinda like Assassin's Creed 2 is still considered one of the best, if not the best. Games in that aspect, tends to follow the same rules as movies.\nSure there was Pandora Tomorrow in between, but no one wants to remember Pandora Tomorrow... It could as well not exist seeing it's not in the bundle and it's apparently unplayable due to shadow issues.\n\nThoses considerations aside, Chaos Theory pretty much improved on all aspects. Graphisms are nice, still good nowdays without being stellar, animations are fluid, Fisher got new moves, the HUD give more indications on the noise you emit and the lighting, missions are more intresting and involved, people you grab can be interrogated for some pretty hilarious, or sometimes meaningful dialogues, and controls are a lot more PC friendly.\n\nScenario isn't really that much better than the first game, Fisher is going to save the US/Free World again, against a group of mooks no one really cares about and which are easyly forgetable.\n\nThe game is more about its gameplay, which is pretty good at what it does, without being the miracle people would like it to be. You will probably enjoy your time playing it, bar some minor annoyances such as scripted events you have limited to no control on, then put the game on a shelf.\nA good purchase to get during a sale, at least, and a classic.","May 27","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

If you love stealth games, this is a must have.\n\nIv'e been a Splinter Cell fan since the original. The first two games were great, but Choas Theory is a masterpiece. Ubisoft seemed to forget what Splinter Cell was about with EVERY game after this. Dumping stealth for generic action. Black List brought a TINY hint of stealth back but it was just basic and castrated.\n\nIt runs flawlessly on Windows 7 as well. No files to replace or 3rd party patches needed. A rare thing in older PC games. The game's polygon count is a tad low, but it has all the fancy stuff used today like Paralax mapping. The game will pretty much run off a potato. It even ran on the PS2.\n\nIv'e played it on the GameCube, original Xbox, the HD remake on the PS3, and now on PC.

It's also a great stealth game, though. In fact, it's probably the next best thing to a Co-op stealth game you can find out there, and this was made in 2005! The Co-op is different from the singleplayer. It features it's own story that you and a friend (or complete stranger you met online) follow and the maps are full of areas/tasks that can only be completed with both players. It's satisfying when everything goes smoothly and you can high five the other player (in your imagination).\n\nThe AI isn't particularly bright, but that sometimes is because the area they are guarding isn't particularly bright either. This gives you the advantage unless you let them stub their toe on your balls while you crouch in the pitch dark hallway feeling all cool and stealthy. If you're smart, you can press up against the wall like a shadow. They can hear you if you move too fast and get suspicious of things like dead bodies for example, unlike in Assassin's Creed where the guards are like, "Hey, what happend here? Did anyone see the killer? We'll find him eventually!" Then they go on their mary way waiting for you to kill them. Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory does it right, because the enemies get anxious and stay anxious.\n\nWhen that happens, the in-game music changes to a faster, super spy tempo and sets the mood. But they aren't really your enemies unless they are in your way. You can knock them out or kill them, depending on the mission intel. Sometimes, killing means you lose, so instead of choosing your battles, try your best to avoid them all together, because they have more guns than you that go ratatatatat.\n\nTL;DR - It's a good game from a forgotten time. 9/10","February 5, 2014","true","17.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/4cylinder/recommended/13570/","4cylinder","4cylinder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/4cylinder/","378 products in account","The best Splinter Cell title ever made\nSo, Blacklist turned out to be pretty good and a huge improvement over Conviction which was a detraction from the core SC formula. However, the definitive SC experience will always be Chaos Theory, which largely corrected the flaws of the previous games while further improving the strengths.\n\nWhen this game released in 2005, it was a graphical masterpiece that pushed the consoles to their limits, and also put strain on the most powerful PC GPUs of the time. Ten years later, the graphics still hold up pretty well, especially the lighting effects which are essential to the stealth gameplay.\n\nThe freedom of choice you get in this game is incredible, and sadly absent in the later titles. In previous games, it was difficult to do things more than one way. That guard HAD to be KOed/killed. That door's lock HAD to be picked. There was rarely more than one path. In Chaos Theory, the levels are more sandbox-like, with multiple possible routes for you to discover. You can break locks or you can spend time picking them.. You can wait for a guard to come walking up to a door, and then slam it into his face with all your strength, or you can wait for him to turn away, and do a standard stealth KO. You can open a door slowly, pushing it a little more forward with each press of the W key, or you can fling it open and exposing yourself. You can hack electronic locks or retinal scanners or you can force guards to cooperate. You can hack PCs to disable lasers and cameras or you can play a dodging minigame. It's also much easier to carve your own 100% avoidance path this time because you get a lot of room to breathe.\n\nEvery single enemy could be interrogated which expanded gameplay possibilities and also made for amusing easter eggs.\n\nThe alarm system was much more forgiving without making the game too easy. Gone are the days of instant-failure because some dude saw you even if he didn't get a chance to radio for backup.\n\nThe story was quite engaging, and made Sam Fisher more involved in the plot rather than just an everyday cleanup guy.\n\nAI was significantly improved from older games. Enemies would start using flashlights, lighting flares, and calling backup instead of just walking blindly towards the sight of a broken light.\n\nMelee attacks, a serious letdown in the past, are now my favourite way to deal with trouble. Sam Fisher now gets a knife that can do one-hit kills. If he wants to go non-lethal, he throws a fast punch to the head - a LOT more effective and realistic than the stupid elbow move in the previous games.\n\nChaos Theory isn't a shooter, and it's difficult to play it like one without dying within seconds. Nevertheless, should the ♥♥♥♥ hit the fan, the guns are more effective than before, giving you choices of attachments (gadget launcher or shotgun or sniper attachment?) and making ammo more readily available (you can now carry more than 2 mags per gun at a time). The pistol is more accurate so you don't waste so many rounds to take out one light. The rifle with its attachments can make for many interesting possibilities (long range stealth kills, sticky shocker KOs, etc).\n\nCo-op mode was the first of its kind, allowing two players to play as Splinter Cells and boost each other over walls and work in tandem to do coordinated kills. It was even more fun than the campaign, but sadly a bit short.\n\nI've never tried Spies vs Mercenaries so no comment there.\n\nAnyone who enjoys stealth games like Metal Gear Solid and Hitman will find this well worth a few bucks.","September 18, 2015","true","20.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It looks like DeusEx:HumanRevolution imitated much of this game, so if you liked that, you'll like this. Gameplay is solid and tactical, but I found it a bit too linear and scripted. The controls also feel a bit clunky, especially if you have to start shooting. I had a few minor issues with light detection. Most graphics are average (it was designed for first gen xbox), but some details were really good, like a floor cleaner really making the part he cleans with his mop more reflective as he goes!

Multiple ways to complete objectives yet the game forces you to go stealth. This game is unforgiving and that's what makes it great. There is never a point in time where it holds your hand. There are no objective markers, forcing you to interogate guards and eavesdrop on conversations to find infomation to lead you to your next location, all while remaining completely undetected.\n\nYour gadgets will help you stay out of the dark and stay out of sight. Brillant stealth game, highly recommend for players interested in the genre. Graphics have aged well for a 7 year old game too.","September 24, 2014","true","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As usual I will be dividing my review in parts. So without any further adieu lets jump into the business here -\n\nStory: The plot is, as with any other "Splinter Cell" title, is self-untangling. At the beginning player will have a very limited knowledge about the entire plot and that is revealed as the game is progressed. The plot itself may not appeal to the average FPS people, who are looking for Aim-n-Shoot kinda play through. But if you invest enough time and senses into the game - the plot is very apt and con-sized.\n\nGameplay: The best part of any "Splinter Cell" title. Yes, though its not an open world environment, still there are more than 1 ways to complete most of the missions. The player will be given ample scope and time and equipments to complete each of the missions as the way they see fit. Players can vary their tactics - they can go complete "Stealth" and not raise a SINGLE!! alarm to complete mission or they can take a bit more direct approach to solve mattes - using bullets, that is.\n\nThe tools are great and fun to use as well - be it a sticky camera or optical fiber or Lock Pic they can make the players life a lot less painful.\n\nGraphics: Now, when we talk about in game graphics - we usually bring out some of the big names of the business but very easily forget about "Splinter Cell" titles. Even for an old game like Chaos Theory, trust me, the graphics is great. The shadows and the ambient glow from the street/table/wall lamps are just too good. But the best part of all of them are the different vision mode of Sam Fisher's goggles. To me, the "Night Vision" is one of the best rendered "night mode" across all the game titles.\n\nAI: The AI is a strong point in this game - specially how they react to a whisper or when they see a body. Some of the guards are as ignorant as ever yet some of they are very suspicious (even of their own breathing). AI bots take some predefined paths or some random one - specially after they are being alerted. Even an open door or torn curtain can raise there suspicion. Be very careful to watch your light and ambient noise meter all the time - and don't hesitate to grab one if needed.\n\nAll in all I am really enjoying the game and I would surely recommend anyone who is looking a different breed of the FPS genre.\n\n- Go Covert -","May 22, 2014","true","24.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nick930930/recommended/13570/","Nick930930","Nick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nick930930/","256 products in account","The best video game I have ever played hands down. I have played through this countless times. It's perfect in every way and form. The solo campaign is lengthy with plenty of variety in environments. You'll sneak around cargo ships, apartmetns in NYC, and Japanese villages as the ultimate spy. Chaos Theory offers vast amounts of options for every level ensuring plenty of replay value. The graphics, while obviously old, still hold up pretty well to todays standards; with reflective surfaces, lots of realistic textures, and an AI system that is so much fun to mess with. The music, written by Amon Tobin, is fantastic and some of the best original soundtrack work for a video game I've heard. This is a game that you just NEED TO PLAY!\n\nThe coop mode was amazing when it was working. It was at least 6 more missions that you could play with a friend and there were even some unique abilities you could do with your partner, like throwing him/her across hallways to knock out guards, or climbing them like a human ladder to get into higher windows. The servers aren't available anymore as far as I know, but I'm sure if you try and host one with your friend you should still be able to play it.\n\nThe versus mode is a totally seperate game that's very creative and loads of fun. However! Be warned, this game is highly competitive and the players that are still playing online know the maps inside and out. It's best to play this mode with your friends until you get good enough to play against the 6 or so players that are still playing this online. Also, since the game's versus mode runs on an old engine, the lighting doesn't work anymore with new Nvidia video cards. There Is a fix if you go into the steam communtiy hub to fix it, but if you don't do this, the mercenaries flashlights won't work; which is not good considering you need the flashlight to see in the dark to find spies.\n\nAnyway, this game is a must play for anyone who's ever even had the slightest interest in video games... and considering you're reading this on "Steam", I'm almost positive you have some interest in video games yourself. So buy this game.. now.","July 16, 2012","true","59.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is an 8 year old game that actually aged quite well: some of the levels look quite good and the game utilises the lighting and shadow effects superbly.\n\nYou play as Sam Fisher, member of a secret US black ops team, and are dispatched to various locations in order to find evidence, defuse a bomb, eliminate a terrorist, capture someone alive, etc. Although the game is linear, throughout the missions you are given secondary and opportunity objectives, therefore, the game tries to lengthen the singleplayer experience as much as possible. At the end of each level you are given a rating in accordance with the number of objectives you completed. In addition to this, the game counts whether or not you killed someone - this, in fact, lowers your score so it's best to focus on the stealth approach, otherwise achieving 100% is impossible. While making sure you are not seen by anybody or any cameras you can also knock your enemies out and hide the bodies.\n\nI like how varied the environment is: Sam can use a lot of objects, can climb a lot of things and can hang from a lot of places. There are also minigames in each level: you can do a lot of lockpicking, hacking and before knocking out or killing someone it's worth interrogating them to get some more intel for your objective. These interrogations can be funny due to the well-written script.\n\nIt is unfortunate that coop and multiplayer are not played anymore, so, if this is on sale, make sure you grab it but only for the singleplayer experience.","January 12, 2014","true","13.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whiehman/recommended/13570/","whiehman","Poo2Loo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whiehman/","157 products in account","This game is scary good. It's a show of what happens when a developer is in sync with what is happening in video games.\n\nSplinter Cell: Chaos Theory was released in 2005 for the Xbox, PS2 and GameCube - development for PC was sort of an afterthought. It served to hold as the best stealth game of all time. You control Sam Fisher (or other characters, in CoOP or Spies vs. Mercenaries), playing as a true spy throughout various secret missions, which eventually take you across the sea to Asia.\n\nThe controls, for PC version, after tricky to get used to at first but serve the player very well in having complete control over Sam Fisher. It's not hard for the player to learn how to be running full speed, execute a combat roll, and be sneaking up against a wall. The interface is extremely clear about what the player has equipped and what is going on around them. Overall, the presentation is extremely clean cut and minimalistic, immersing the player as much as they can in their role of sneaking around and interrogating and executing/knocking out baddies.\n\nMultiplayer is an option as well, consisting of a CoOp game mode and Spies vs. Mercenaries. Both modes are tweaked to better reflect the player having a fun experience, with CoOp having tweaks that require and encourage cooperation with things like a change of the electronic-jamming pistol, cooperation-exclusive moves like boosting each other up and a martial arts toss, and an interweaving campaign with the single player mode. Spies vs Mercenaries pits spies against mercenaries, giving the mercenaries more lethal means of dispatching the spies while stripping spies of most lethal means to kill someone, instead settling for crowd control methods.\n\nChaos Theory is a timeless game. It truly is, and for whatever price is available on Steam, ranging from $9.99 to $2.50, is worth it. My only word of advice is to be cautious that Ubisoft does not force this game onto their horrid DRM system, uPlay - we don't want to purchase a game on Steam and have to be told to sign up for YET ANOTHER ACCOUNT like the Assassin's Creed series.","September 18, 2015","true","36.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It really had the classic Splinter Cell gameplay and had really started to emphasize on assault tactics if you preferred, which is pretty neat. I myself am a stealth guy, and I was not disappointed in the slightest bit when it came to seeking a challenge. Expert Stealth is probably THE way to play this game, as you will get the entire Splinter Cell experience. I was a kid when I played this originally so of course I was running in and spraying, bashing doors into the enemy LMAOOO sometimes your parnter!\n\nEven the soundtrack to this game is really good. Really ♥♥♥♥ing good as a matter of fact. Hats off to you, Amon Tobin! The soundtrack chilled and stressed out with you as the player depending on your situation in the game, and at the time of this release, I'm sure it must have been groundbreaking in terms of video games and OST.\n\nThe sound and lighting aspects were on point, AI, gameplay, blah blah blah. It was all diamonds and gold for me man.\n\nThis game really holds a valuable spot in my heart (as do many games, for I am beyond the deepest universal levels of all things geek and game) and I would give this a 12/10 because the soundtrack (Kokubo Sosho Battle theme is life) will forever be reminding me of when I used to sneak out haha.\n\nwhat is this water coming out of my eyes right now","May 30","true","111.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/villermen/recommended/13570/","villermen","Villermen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/villermen/","323 products in account","This is a great stealth game. It's basically more of the first games, with less bugs and a sound detection bar. It's just weird that there's an "Assault" option for loadouts, as going in guns blazing will ruin the game completely. The most enjoyable way to play it is by trying to stay unseen and taking out only the guys standing directly in your way to the objective (IMHO). Changing your speed with the scrollwheel is a neat mechanic that I liked about this game. So is the alt-fire on the pistol that disabled electronics (so that you don't have to shoot them anymore).\n\nIt has a great soundtrack that changes every level and as you get spotted or identified.\n\nOh, there's plot too, mainly so that the missions don't all appear the same.\n\nThis brings me to the less enjoyable part of the game: the repetition. Pretty much all you do is sneak around people or lure them till you can get behind them and snatch them. This made it very hard to play the game for longer than an hour at once, and I became pretty bored of it nearing the end. Some more ways of getting the information you need or getting people out of your way would be cool. The airfoil rounds, sticky shockers and gas grenades are supposed to do that job, but they all work in pretty much the same way.

Having said that, Chaos Theory is still a fun game with pretty decent controls for a game that is so old. At first, the controls suck something fierce, but after you play for a while you will start to get used to them and they won't be a problem anymore, although how you run and how you use a weapon is still dumb. And of course one really fun thing about the newer games is that they have really cool kill animations. Here they are pretty crappy. One really great thing about this game (for me at least) is despite its age, there were no compatibility issues (Win 8.1 Pro) and no sound/control/mouse sensitivity issues which you will see in a lot of PC games that are as old as this one.\nIf you can afford Conviction and/or Blacklist, buy those over this for sure. If you like those games and want more Splinter Cell, then this is where you wanna go next.","January 3, 2014","true","2.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","5"

Yeah this stuff isn't wrong I truly love the game for its single player experience and all that it offers in that department. However there is no online funtionality due to the trash state of the servers, The bulk of these hours I have on record were probably from attempts of trying to coop with my pal and get some of the 'Spies vs Mercs' action the Splinter Cell series is renowned for. None of this was possible :(. I'm just a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that after returning to this game after many years via computer my hopes and dreams of online play were destroyed, more so that none of this information was made available to me on the Steam Store before my purchase. I lost $20.\n\nTLDR; IMO and many other's its the best single player stealth game in existence. However Steam failed to communicate to me that it has no FUNTIONAL online play so f*ck Steam and Ubisoft for ripping me off.

They haven't got a chance!\n\nNotes\nChaos Theory stands head and shoulders above Pandora Tomorrow on Gamecube--the only other Splinter Cell I've played--but that doesn't necessarily mean it's an enjoyable game.\nThe stealth is tight, the controls are great, and the graphics are unusually impressive. But the fun is somehow lacking. Performing takedown after takedown, quicksaving after every one, and rarely, if ever, using a weapon of any kind is the M.O. here, and that just doesn't equate to a fulfilling experience. Even the temporary thrill of stalking a baddie into a corner and performing a surprise jugular-ectomy is dampened by the thought that twenty more of those experiences await you further on in the level.\nI guess what I'm saying is--it's not a game for me. I bought it in a bundle, so I'm not too bummed. I just wish there was a spark of life in Chaos Theory, some real zest... Some pizzazz.\nNope.

Chaos Theory returns to form though as Sam Fisher must prevent full-scale war erupting on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nChaos Theory was the point where the series matured and achieved perfection. Michael Ironside must have had a blast recording Sam Fisher’s dialogue for this edition. There are nuggets of pure comedy gold among Sam’s dialogue, such as when he cons a National Guardsman into believing his presence (and knife at his throat) is simply a training exercise, or Grimsdottir’s most recent attempt to set him up on a date.\n\nAside from the introduction of a knife and the OCP on the pistol there are no new weapons in Sam’s arsenal but there are a number of new non-lethal ways of dealing with your enemies. The OCP is a huge boon, used to temporarily disable electric lighting which not just saves bullets but also helps maintain your stealth as the AI’s powers of perception have improved greatly, especially when spotting broken lights. Sam can also change what arm his SC-20K is resting on, making shooting around left-sided corners without being detected much easier. The ability to choose the contents of your weaponry prior to starting a mission (recommendation, stealth, or assault) is another cool introduction. Players are also marked on their performance at the end of each mission out of 100%, with non-lethal kills, never being detected as an intruder, and the completion of secondary objectives contributing to your final score.\n\nAs well as feeling much more authentic than its two predecessors in terms of graphics and lighting, Chaos Theory also saw the first time Sam had a relationship with one of the antagonists, which culminates in a gripping showdown reminiscent of GoldenEye. Overall the dialogue is snappier, the gameplay more fluid, the graphics sharper, which unsurprisingly makes it just as enjoyable to play as it was back in 2005.\n\nA massive 10/10: the best entry of the whole Splinter Cell series.","December 5, 2014","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That was before I started using Steam; when my PS2 was my only means of gaming.\nI never bought the game for PS2, but after recently discovering it was on Steam, and having an urge to purchase a new game, I shipped it in.\nI've always been a fan of the stealth genre in gaming - praising several stealth game titles, my favorite being Metal Gear Solid.\n[ACTUAL REVIEW]\nThis game is everything the stealth genre stands for. You have a large amount of ways to excecute levels throughout the game. I discovered that you can play through certain levels without firing a single bullet, or without making any form of human contact with enemies patroling the area.\nFor those of you who are fans of stealth games with some action elements and slow-pacing gameplay this is the game for you. For a game released in 2007, this is truly an unbelievably amazing installment to the stealth genre.","January 4, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And this game is one big test of your tactical skills and patience. In my opinion, the best in the series, and in the genre, Splinter Cell Chaos Theory towers over all stealth games, the only other game that managed to get near the perfection of this game was indie hit, Mark of The Ninja, but let's talk about Chaos Theory.\nSam Fisher, a splinter cell agent, a one man special ops agent, is tasked by the his agency to find the missing agent on an island, he finds him, and the whole web of conspiracies and plans to start a new world war uncover. The story is excellent, about informational warfare, thin line between war and peace, and the extent a man must go to prevent something sinister. Story is really good, like a good spy-thriller movie.\nGameplay is upgraded from the previous games, more complex, but in the same time, more rewarding. Your main thought that should guide you throughout the game is "SNEAK". You will die of one shot, so think and be patient. There's a new lighting system in the game, showing you, out of 4 levels of lighting, whether enemy can see you or not. A sound system shows the sound you're making by walking, and the sound of the ambient (TVs, radios...), this allows you to walk faster, or shoot the guy, not risking getting caught. Graphics are beautiful, especially seen in the boat mission, the lighting effects on the old walls of boat really gives you the emersion you need.\nAll in all, stealth fans, get this. It is an old game, but it is a game that passed the test of time, and is one of the more complex and best stealth games out there. A must have.","August 2, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have the first 5 entries of the Splinter Cell franchise on PC, and it really does go to show that Chaos Theory was the evolutionary peak of the franchise. The gameplay mechanics are refined, and the game just plays smoother than Splinter Cell and Pandora Tomorrow. The game also allows you to choose your playstyle, be it super-sneaky, or going in guns blazing, and you can choose your loadout before the mission accordingly. The coop mode is solid too. Unfortunately, there's no one playing the versus Spy Vs Mercs mode anymore, so that's a wasted game mode at this time. Another issue myself, and other people have had is the fact that the in-game Steam overlay doesn't appear at all. The only way to fix this is to re-add the game as a non-Steam shortcut. This is annoying as some people would like to take screenshots and whatnot, and as I play on a laptop, would like to see a battery warning pop up when I'm not charging. But all in all, this is a brilliant game that stills looks brillliant despite the fact that it's something like 9 years old. If you found the restrictions in Pandora Tomorrow frustratating (such as one little mistake and you've triggered an alarm), then this is what you need- it's easier to get around mistakes... but it's not an easy game on its hardest difficulty.","August 3, 2014","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Chaos Theory returns to form though as Sam Fisher must prevent full-scale war erupting on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nChaos Theory was the point where the series matured and achieved perfection. Michael Ironside must have had a blast recording Sam Fisher’s dialogue for this edition. There are nuggets of pure comedy gold among Sam’s dialogue, such as when he cons a National Guardsman into believing his presence (and knife at his throat) is simply a training exercise, or Grimsdottir’s most recent attempt to set him up on a date.\n\nAside from the introduction of a knife and the OCP on the pistol there are no new weapons in Sam’s arsenal but there are a number of new non-lethal ways of dealing with your enemies. The OCP is a huge boon, used to temporarily disable electric lighting which not just saves bullets but also helps maintain your stealth as the AI’s powers of perception have improved greatly, especially when spotting broken lights. Sam can also change what arm his SC-20K is resting on, making shooting around left-sided corners without being detected much easier. The ability to choose the contents of your weaponry prior to starting a mission (recommendation, stealth, or assault) is another cool introduction. Players are also marked on their performance at the end of each mission out of 100%, with non-lethal kills, never being detected as an intruder, and the completion of secondary objectives contributing to your final score.\n\nAs well as feeling much more authentic than its two predecessors in terms of graphics and lighting, Chaos Theory also saw the first time Sam had a relationship with one of the antagonists, which culminates in a gripping showdown reminiscent of GoldenEye. Overall the dialogue is snappier, the gameplay more fluid, the graphics sharper, which unsurprisingly makes it just as enjoyable to play as it was back in 2005.\n\nA massive 10/10: the best entry of the whole Splinter Cell series.","December 5, 2014","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was most dissapointing.\n\nOther than that, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game to ANYONE who is looking for a fun, challenging and AWESOME STEALTH GAME!","April 2, 2015","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is a bit interesting, to sum it up it's about multiple groups trying to change world powers and start a revolution using deception and an advanced computer algorithym.

I'm not a huge fan of the Splinter Cell series even though I played the first 3 titles, but I must say that 10 years after its release it's still worth buying because the story mode is solid and the variety of weapons, moves and interactions is quite impressive.\nThe multiplayer mode is very nice since it brings new moves to be made with a partner. It increases the length of the game by bringing new missions to be played in co-op mode. There is also versus mode which is very convenient.\nI highly recommend this game.","December 26, 2013","true","23.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the epitome of stealth games. Any other game, whether a different franchise, or even sequels with better graphics, can't hold a candle to Chaos Theory. It has the most realistic feel of any action/thriller game I've ever played. You are given minimal help throughout the mission. There are certain moments in games when you get lost, have no idea what you're doing, etc. Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is the embodiment of that feeling. This game is legendary. Also, the graphics are not half bad. I can run maximum settings with my Inspiron 660 with an AMD Radeon 7770.\nThe AI's are pretty phenomenal. It's hard not to get immersed in the world of Chaos Theory right off the bat. I once chose to spare a guard because he was talking about what a pathetic paycheck he gets, and how he'll never be able to afford motion sensor lights. It's very impressive how well this game can both absorb you and excite you--all with minimal blood and gore.\nThis is a game about making decisions, critical thinking, and strategy. Approaching a guard silently from behind, hoping he won't turn around, moments like that make your heart explode. It's amazing how well the game makes you absorb that true stealth badass identity. You can feel yourself in Fisher's every movement. The way he draws his knife as approaching an enemy, his clever interrogation dialogue; all of these contribute to his hard-core character.\nSC:CT will not dissapoint. Some might take one glance at it and say, "Oh, 2005. Not for me." This is one of my favorite games, and just keeps climbing up the list. Dry, self-aware wit, stellar lighting, and interesting plot make Chaos Theory what it is today. $10 for a legend.","January 30, 2014","true","39.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The amount of power and control you have--ranging from lethal brutality to imperceptible sneaking and subduing--adds much depth to the experience. Want to kill everyone in sight? Do so.

This is the best game in the Splinter Cell franchise, and the best stealth game in general, in my opinion. One of my favorite things about this game is the fact that there are multiple ways to go about getting past a certain obstacle. Plenty of gadgets, the ability to whistle at enemies, tampering with the lights, sneaking up behind enemies and forcing information out of them--all of this is the definition of an amazingly crafted stealth game. Also, being able to go through the game not killing anyone is an option. The story on the other hand is not amazing, but still enough to keep you interested in what's goin on. This game is fantastic, and anyone looking for a stealth focused experience should definitely buy this game.","December 30, 2013","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most games I had played had been simple run and gun shooters, like Halo. So when I found a game that had similar mechanics only the objective was not kill everything that moves I was pretty impressed. The story is pretty enjoyable, but it was not the games selling point. The game really excelled in the co-op where two people could run around a level, completing objectives, taking out guards stealthily or setting off an alarm and having to shoot your way out. I think the best part of the co-op was the challenges and obstacles that could only be achieved with two players. For instance some floors might have a row of laser activated alarms, which normally would not be passable, but thanks to your partner you could be thrown a crossed the room avoiding the trap and turn them off allowing passage for your buddy. Overall it feels like you two really achieve something when working together to take down missions, Ubisoft really did this series justice with this game.","December 23, 2013","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay was similar enough to older games that  vetrans could pick it up and breeze right through it, while new players to the series will be able to learn as they go. It added some new mechanics, like the aural bar to minitor Sam's noise level and compares it to the noise level around him, more realistic AI detection, and the close qaurters combat was greatly improved. The levels are not completely linear, as you can choose different routes to complete different objectives, but they are linear enough to avoid backtracking.

This is the epitome of stealth games. Any other game, whether a different franchise, or even sequels with better graphics, can't hold a candle to Chaos Theory. It has the most realistic feel of any action/thriller game I've ever played. You are given minimal help throughout the mission. There are certain moments in games when you get lost, have no idea what you're doing, etc. Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is the embodiment of that feeling. This game is legendary. Also, the graphics are not half bad. I can run maximum settings with my Inspiron 660 with an AMD Radeon 7770.\nThe AI's are pretty phenomenal. It's hard not to get immersed in the world of Chaos Theory right off the bat. I once chose to spare a guard because he was talking about what a pathetic paycheck he gets, and how he'll never be able to afford motion sensor lights. It's very impressive how well this game can both absorb you and excite you--all with minimal blood and gore.\nThis is a game about making decisions, critical thinking, and strategy. Approaching a guard silently from behind, hoping he won't turn around, moments like that make your heart explode. It's amazing how well the game makes you absorb that true stealth badass identity. You can feel yourself in Fisher's every movement. The way he draws his knife as approaching an enemy, his clever interrogation dialogue; all of these contribute to his hard-core character.\nSC:CT will not dissapoint. Some might take one glance at it and say, "Oh, 2005. Not for me." This is one of my favorite games, and just keeps climbing up the list. Dry, self-aware wit, stellar lighting, and interesting plot make Chaos Theory what it is today. $10 for a legend.","January 30, 2014","true","39.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The stealth of this game is something fresh from its time, A brightness meter and sound meter that the new games are missing. The A.I. on this game does tend to be stupid at times but when you do get hit by bullets do it only takes a good 3 or 4 for a game over. AND since it's an old game there are NO CHECKPOINTS so do save intervally when you make a desicion on your approach.\n\nOverall.

If you want the most in-depth Splinter Cell experience offering everything the stealth genre has to offer and more, look no further. Chaos Theory is Splinter Cell at its prime, taking the stealth genre to new heights with all of its features.\n\nAs Sam Fischer, you must navigate your way through enemy territory to uncover plans, eliminate targets, and do all you can to put a stop to a diabolical terrorist plan that could mean World War 3 if the villains succeed. Story-wise, this is about what you would expect from a Splinter Cell game and it can be pretty intriguing to say the least. The single player is a decent length, featuring 10 levels at high security areas that for me took roughly 13+ hours to complete.\n\nLet's get this out of the way. The game was released in 2005, so of course the visuals are dated. The characters' eyes are kind of big and googly, backgrounds can look very bland, etc. But if you can look at and appreciate the textures and details for what they were at the time, you will overlook the graphics and concentrate on what really matters (and this can be said about many old games).\n\nThe dialogue is thrilling Tom Clancy as usual. You receive orders from Lambert as usual as well as chatter from your other Third Echelon members. What really shines here are the many, many jokes, sarcastic remarks, and gripping words Sam uses in various instances. Not only does he retort with witty responses over the radio back to Lambert as he did in SC1 and Pandora Tomorrow, but also during the vast amount of interrogations he has with enemies should you choose to put the choke hold on them. I really got a kick out of Sam's exchanges with foes in his grasp; enemy: "What's going on?" Sam: "Are you supposed to be here? Identify yourself" or "I'm the landlord and Zerkhezi forgot to pay his rent. Any idea where he is?" Just like the stealth options, these responses seem limitless and different for each enemy that I interrogated (and there are many basic enemies you can interrogate in each of the 10 levels).\n\nHere is what truly makes this game soar: the GAMEPLAY! Game developers could learn (or relearn, as some seem to have forgotten) several concepts of how to approach an action-packed spy tale while getting rid of the cliches and mundane, run-of-the-mill gameplay mechanics of today (Assassin Creed's "kill guy from hay bale, leap out, run to next instant kill point, repeat" comes to mind here). Chaos Theory gives the player a multitude of options: Open door? Open door stealthily? Bash door open? Pick lock? Break lock? Optic cable? Many doors have all of these options for whatever you are feeling at the time. DIstracting guards: Pick up and throw object? Whistle? Blast light with EMP from pistol? Or take the old way and just shoot out the light? There are also several routes to the objective(s) and you can spend several playthroughs going through the level, perhaps through the vents here and taking out the guard there or maybe climbing up the pole and onto the balcony this time to snag the intel and avoid the first floor cameras. The point is that the choices are so many and you are constantly hammered with scenarios in which you can do it all again and again. It is all up to you and how you want to play the game. This type of game most likely inspired the varied choices of stealth games like Dishonored and Mark of the Ninja because it plays much the same way. It's perfect!\n\nOne minor flaw is that the AI can be sort of annoying in some areas, especially the Seoul level later on when the fighting breaks out. It can be difficult to maneuver around these guys which, at the drop of a hat, can instantly recognize you and fire upon you before you even know you were spotted. However this is typically not the case, as most of the game takes place in areas with relative amounts of darkness to use to sneak by the unsuspecting guards.\n\nAll in all, this was a wonderful gaming experience and perfect for any Splinter Cell fan as well as gamers that enjoy true stealth (not the stripped-down stealth games we seem to be having today).\n\n9.5/10","February 5, 2014","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay was similar enough to older games that  vetrans could pick it up and breeze right through it, while new players to the series will be able to learn as they go. It added some new mechanics, like the aural bar to minitor Sam's noise level and compares it to the noise level around him, more realistic AI detection, and the close qaurters combat was greatly improved. The levels are not completely linear, as you can choose different routes to complete different objectives, but they are linear enough to avoid backtracking.

The co-op is a 2-player setup where you go out on missions in enemy bases during the darkest hours (nighttime :3) to act out some kind of plan. It makes you feel like a secret agent - and man is that a good feeling. Technically speaking it was a very advanced game for its time. The graphics still look pretty decent, and the AI would be alerted to sound, and how visible you were based on the envinonments lights. You could disable or shoot out lights, pick locks, slam doors into people (or thin air in some cases,) and hack computer systems. A very solid stealth game both single player and co-op.","July 18, 2012","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you go stealth, you can go the entire game (besides the main guys you are sent to kill) without a single casualty. That is one of the things I look for in a stealth game, and they nailed it. In a couple levels, you can't actually kill anyone at all, which some people might find annoying, but I find it's a better stealth experience going non-lethal, because it's more hiding in the dark, and less standing and shooting. You can complete the game a lot faster if you if you use guns, and the first time I played this, I decided to go non-lethal and the first level took over an hour. It's really fun though.

If you played conviction, your doing it wrong. This is the true original most epic stealth game made. It also has amazing graphics for it's time back in 2004. This was the best of the best, and I will play it any day.\n\nThe missions aren't always the same. You will love almost every single mission. The mulitplayer is ok, but the Co-Op is the best part if you wanna involve online play with friends. The replay value is an 8 out of 10, because you can almost always do something differently.\n\nIt's got an amazing, maybe even the best, stealth engine that is realistic. The only way you could say that it wasn't is if you are playing this game on medium or lower graphics due to shaders, shadows and lighting being a bit off if you dont use high graphics with vsync.\n\nI know this game may sound a bit demanding on the High End Graphics part, but remember, this game was made a long time ago, so almost anywone can play with High Graphics.\n\nI give it a 10/10!","January 9, 2012","true","100.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it may be lacking in actual story, (hacker this, algorithum that, terrorists, conspiracy, yadayadayada) it actually makes you not want to kill, no i'm not talking about score, i'm talking about emotion, picture this: you walk towards a light house, you begin to see two sillowettes talking, they are guards, the enemy, terrorists. you feel like a badass, stalking them in the dark, they can't see you, you begin to draw your knife, but you overhear thair conversation, one is talking about his family being massacred by amaricans... you decide to leave them be.\n\naside from that, the gameplay is top notch, this was the last TRUE stealth game in the splinter cell series (Double agent sucked, Conviction was great, but it was mostly action) and it remains the best (1 was ok, but it is a bit dated, pandora tomarrow [why isnt it on steam?] i always thought was dissapointing)\n\nLAST NOTE: I originally bought this on PS2, this is a far superior version, it has some nice graphical touches (when someone goes into the rain thair clothing gets shiny and wet), the colors are brighter, the levels are longer, no mid-level loads, my only complaints on the pc versions is that it is a bit to bright (adjust before playing) the controls are a bit wierd (but after a bit of practice you get used to them) and the save system sucks, manually save regularly.\n\nas a final word: BUY THIS GAME NOW!","February 15, 2013","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is fabulous and the main reason why I played this game. Your character is very agile and can do a lot of gymnastic moves. On top of it you have some wonderful gadgets to help you solve missions. This is the fun part. The big problem with this game is the story. It is extremely badly explained, you have no idea what is going on, no idea where you are going, or why you are doing what you are doing. I tried that not to bother me. I kept telling myself, "I am an agent, I just do what the intelligence says I should do", and focused on completing missions.

The game is great, it's a very polished stealth game. The story is a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but the stealth mechanics are what make it great.\n\nAny who, this is a pretty good port/release. You can turn the resolution and filtering up much higher than you'd expect and it almost makes this game look like it came out recently. The only weird thing is don't look directly into Fisher's face because that model was not meant to have that much definition. He just looks like a cross-eyed goon when you have the settings turned all the way up. It actually has decent support for a 360 controller, just the button mappings are a little weird, but you can change them. I didn't encounter any performance issues or bugs that were notable.

What a happy surprise it has turned out to be.\n\nChaos Theory is the third installment in the Splinter Cell series and places you once again in control of Third Echelon agent Sam Fisher as he investigates a cyber-warfare plot that threatens the stability of the free world.\n\nWith tight controls, an intuitive interface, multiple ways to complete objectives and overcome enemies, this stealth experience is not one to be missed. The amount of power and control you have--ranging from lethal brutality to imperceptible sneaking and subduing--adds much depth to the experience. Want to kill everyone in sight? Do so. Want to avoid all encounters, crawling through vents and hacking door codes? Eat your heart out. The thrill of the hunt can be accomplished however you can imagine it.

Still holds up in my eyes, always one of my favorites... actually this may be the only one I ever played, so that would explain it!\n\nThe story is independent enough from the others you can just dive in. It's a classic story of espionage and irratible governments, and its up to YOU to figure out the TRUTH... with murder. The options to go through levels is challenging and varies. Plenty of animations and ways to kill the opposition and make your way to your objective. Good steady difficulty curve, even as a kid I could make my way through if I sat back and figured it out. I'd say good for ages 9 and up, as long as you're ok with them murdering in a virtual world (or witnessing torture*). They should be able to figure out how to get through each level, even if they have to go through them once or twice.\n\nThe multiplayer on this was a BLAST, didn't try it since I was younger but it was easy to setup a game, hopefully its still just as easy. The multiplayer isn't exactly FAIR... but custom rules can be created. I beleive we had spies with... 3 lives? and the mercs with one life each on teams of 2v2 or 3v2 (spy v merc). Certain visions and weapons were banned from use, otherwise the mercs will win within a matter of seconds. The way we played, it was scary for the Mercs as they tried to say alive and kill the spies, the spies just trying to find and make opportunities to take down the mercs. You'll understand if you play, maybe we sucked as spies, but we made it work.\n\nI remembered the game, not 100% but I remembered pieces. I was able to beat the game in 10 hours. For an adult new to this game, maybe 12-15 hours of gameplay. For a younger person this could take 10-20 hours, and should hold their attention, especially if they like to sneak and stealth.\n\n* Early in the game there is torture happening by way of electricity. You can see it from a distance and hear the conversation, electricity and screams. It's not graphic or TOO intense but if someone too young plays this. You understand. After that its not bad, just sneaking and killing.","February 27","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now of course your brightness has a big impact on you and your enemies. The bar works like a brightness setting I guess. Point is, the closer you get to light, the farther left (right?) it goes. If you are in full brightness then enemies I believe from anywhere can see you. Now the Aural monitor is the annoying part. The aural monitor watches your speed setting, the faster you go the easier enemies can hear you. Now the scoll wheel on your mouse functions as a speed changer, the closer you get to enemies the lower you scroll your mouse because unlike most of the games, you can't just walk behind a enemy and grab them, you have to gradually get slower until it prompts you to grab them, but this can f**k you over cause it doesn't tell you very much about the monitor. But I must admit, for it's problems I can forgive it, I...LOVE REALISM IN STEALTH GAMES! I am not a big fan of the cartoony stealth like "stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s" or...well you get me. I like realistic stealth games where you are in situations that can mimic real life. This game does that almost perfectly, I guess this game i- I am getting off track. Stealth = 8/10\n\nSTORY\nNow the story takes you through a bunch of locations ranging from a  Hokkaido Island (a dojo) to a giant ship( Maria Narcissa) and even Seoul, but no one likes the Seoul mission...\nThe story is quite enjoyable if a bit cliche'ed but it does take you to some nice locations. story = 6/10.\n\nHOW DOES IT COMPARE TO NEWER SPINTER CELLS\nI've always found the new spinter cell odd, they changed so much. I felt and think they changed devs or engines, probably both. But I've always thought of conviction and blacklist as different games. They are great themselves it's just if you WANT a STEALTH game then choose this game. The newer ones are more likes AC, if you have someone in your way you kill them, but if you want a "stealth" game then you go for the ones that make you think about your decisions. If I kill this guy will anyone see it? Will I be able to move the body in time? Will anyone hear him drop? Those are the type of stealth games that in my opinion, represent the stealth genre greatly. How does the game fair? 8/10\n\nFINAL THOUGHT\nTom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is a great stealth game. If you are a die-hard fan of stealth then you should have this game. Yes the FMV is cheesy but this is a game that was made in 2006, I don't blame it, and you shouldn't either. But for my final thought, this game is a underrated gem of the series, I find it a guilty pleasure, and from the reviews I see this is a very loved game. Pick it up, please, if you don't like it then just refund it.\n\nTom Clancy's Splinter cell: Chaos Theory (I am saying Tom Clancy too much) get's my final rating of 8/10, a great game! If you enjoyed this review then leave a comment on my profile saying "+rep decent reviewer" it will make me happy <3","June 12, 2015","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zarifis/recommended/13570/","Zarifis","Zarifis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zarifis/","74 products in account","I played this on the ps2 a year or so after it was released. It was my first Splinter Cell title. I spent months only playing up until finding the man in the first mission, until I realized there was a door to load the next section. Once I got past that, it opened the door to loving Splinter Cell, and other stealth genre games.\n\n\nI've heard plenty say this is the center piece of the series, and I somewhat agree. Of course it would be best to start at the first one, but playing this certainly gave a wonderful feel for the rest, Pre-Conviction.\n\n-Graphically, it was great for its time of 2006 I believe, and to this day, I still marvel at some of the maps, and the atmosphere they can put off. It of course looks dated by today's standards, but it doesn't bother me much, which makes sense given the impact in my gaming life it had. I liked it still, and for those who don't mind older looks, this is certainly something then, but as I said, some spots still look quite good for today.\n\n-Gameplay/mechanics wise, I also enjoyed it. Mostly. You actually had a JUMP button. You got to experiment with what you can climb on. If you can make that jump and grab hold. Your only shimmy technique was hands only and no legs, but it was still fine for what it was. Climbing over objects felt right. A little jump, bracing your feet, then vaulting over that railway. It felt so good, as did doing that then dragging a guy over the edge.\n~Guards were, a bit dumb in some places. But still pretty good. They remembered stuff... they were made to notice things. Lights off, doors opened, locks broken, or dead bodies in a chair. You know. simple things. Being able to hide in a dark corner inches from them as they occasionally clip through you was ridiculous however, but that's permitted I'd think. No stealth game has perfected itself, especially not a decade ago.\n~Combat was interesting. Each game does it different, but in this, it was before regeneration, and where the game really meant for you to not be a panther and wreck everyone. Doesn't mean I never tried, but it's rewarding when you played like the silent ghost you were meant to be. shooting could end you in seconds, forcing you to ensure you knew what you were planning. A draw back of decade old game is you can't shoot that guy, knife another, then grab the third in a span of two seconds like you can now. Fisher is totally capable of doing it in this, but it just wasn't able to be done, or wasn't thought to be implemented yet. Dunno.\n~Sneaking was actually necessary. It's what gave you the ability to hear that extra dialog, whether it be for a secondary objective, or for a funny. It was also just.. necessary. It is a damn stealth game after all. Not saying running around with a shotgun, ragdolling people wasn't fun when bored. But, it was nice to take your time, look for that extra path, get that silent interrogation. Or, not touch a single person, and evesdrop. ( Touching someone lowers your score, yo. )\n\n-The plot wasn't anything special, but it was just fine for this little family of people. Good guy go finds thing, discovers news about another thing, goes to find thing, travels to other places about thing, finds out info about guy involving thing, Good Guy looks and finds guy involved with bad thing, emotional moment ensues, and you press on to save the day in a climatic ending. After navigating an annoying as sh*t base. Only finished that last mission once. It's been a while. for the average player, it isn't something new. but for avid lovers of the franchise, it means the world.\n\n-The characters. Oh, the characters. We have the smooth, bald, head rubbing leader Lambert. We have the computer wiz Grimsdottir. We have our tech man Reading. And a few others along the way that give you a briefing. Charming U.S. captain, an old friend or two, and a few other folk I can't recall, along with a whole set of guards and civilians you come across in each mission. Then we have Fisher, pride and true man of Third Echelon. The man you play as. The best of the best. And a great interrogater, with a big knife, and sharp humor. Words are exchangable. Lambert, Reeding, and Grim are with you always through voice comunication. And the group that you grow to love from 1 to double agent. They all have plenty of bits of humor too. This is meant to be a serious game, but every mission, there is at least a couple lines of quick humor, jabs at each other, along with other things you'd hear along the way. Not a day goes by where I don't get giddy hearing dialog bits from Sam, to random baddies in the mission, or to your team. It is certainly something to look forward to cherishing. One of the bigger reasons why I like questioning everyone in new areas, is to find these little nuggets of gold humor. Oh, and did I mention Spy Blue and Spy Red? Cooperative Splinter Cells for the win!\n\n-I really don't think this will come to a close naturally, so I'll end it by force. I could go on and on, describing things, telling you all what I loved and .. not so much loved about this game. But honestly I think I've strayed from 'review' enough. It has it's quirks, like bad jumps and loud landings that make no sense, and loud search music from delayed take downs, but it has so much more great moments of comedy, gameplay and just overall enjoyment rolling around and ( optionally) stabbing folk in the back.\n\n-As a nostalgic Chaos Theory player, I fully give this a 10/10.\n-As a somewhat objective person, I give this an 8/10.\n-As someone with too many bad jokes and a skill of wasting time, I give this an 11/10, and would certainly play again. Have been for 10 years now or so.\n\nGrab a friend, do the coop. ( I suggest a video guide for #1, I even couldn't get it. ) Grab yourself... ( hey, not like that ) and play the single player. Do normal, cherish it. Do secondary tasks, or don't. up to you.  I still haven't on every one. But, definitely try to have fun. Or, go hard mode and just wreck yourself. up to you. then invest in every other game and play for hours.  Have fun now.\n\n\n\n","March 6","true","26.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is fabulous and the main reason why I played this game. Your character is very agile and can do a lot of gymnastic moves. On top of it you have some wonderful gadgets to help you solve missions. This is the fun part. The big problem with this game is the story. It is extremely badly explained, you have no idea what is going on, no idea where you are going, or why you are doing what you are doing. I tried that not to bother me. I kept telling myself, "I am an agent, I just do what the intelligence says I should do", and focused on completing missions. But it be nice to know what the game was about and what my true purpose was in it.","April 7","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
