The writer thought they were much funnier than they actually were. No way to skip the agonizing story segments either.\nMany functions are not intuitive and their use is not explained.  Especially hard to pick up after not playing for quite some time because of this.\nStaff do not work effiently with no way to micromanage them to do a better job. i.e.: I had 2 Decontamination rooms because there was an infectious desease plaguing my hospital.  I hired 4 Decontaminators to handle the load.  They all tried to bring patients to the same Decontamination room which kept it backed up.\nI would have liked more variety of decor and room customization.\nTalking nurse head that gives out missions has that annoying Animal Crossing gibberish and can't be turned off.\nDoes NOT scratch that "Theme Hospital" itch!!  I still find myself going back to play that after I get frustrated with this game.\nI admittedly haven't played this a ton, but that's because it is so infuriating and pales in compairison with Theme Hospital.  I REALLY want an update of that game, but I thought I'd give this a go.  At first I thought it was almost exactly like Theme Hospital...but newer, but it quickly falls apart.  The story plays out like a hospital drama/comedy and the idea is solid, but it drags out and makes me want to poke the writer in the eye.  It's like watching your kid brother try to crack wise, but really it's just sad.  Very disappointing.\nThe diseases and equipment/trteatments are very much inspired by TH, and that's a good thing.  But my patience runs thin when staff aren't effeciently getting paients to their rooms.  It's even harder to deal with when I have to piddle around with ALL the buttons to figure out what I need to do to get things done.  It's hard to tell exactly what you need to do or fix to complete missions/levels.  Most of the time I passed without knowing what I'd fixed.\n","December 5, 2014","false","10.3"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","24","26","0","0"

Treatment doesn’t occur in the examination room but the pharmacy.  That’s not just unrealistic it's counterintuitive\nThe gameplay basically consists of a new illness being identified and then the game telling you what new equipment to buy.\nThe depth is really lacking.  You don’t build out the hospital or decide how much people get paid. All you do is place rooms in a big sandbox and then buy equipment and put it inside.\nThe game is way too silly in my opinion\nThe game has a 1080p mode, but everything is just stretched out to make it fit the screen.\nThe aerial view just shows you the rooms, not any of the people or equipment.\nYou can’t zoom out far enough.","December 4, 2015","false","1.1"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","19","21","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cmiddlebrook/recommended/11590/","cmiddlebrook","Caroline Middlebrook","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cmiddlebrook/","1418 products in account","Please note that I got this game very cheaply as part of a bundle.\n\nThe game it set in 3 different hospitals (a series - though the graphics and mechanics are identical in each) with 4 'episodes' in each - in other words, 12 missions. They have tried to implement a story as a way of introducing each mission but this is actually one of the biggest let downs of the game. I'm a story fan but this is truly awful; the attempt at humor is terrible!\n\nThat's not to say the game isn't funny - the diseases, the animations etc are all funny and well done but I think they should have just left it at that and removed the story element altogether.\n\nThere's a lot wrong with the game. In each mission you have a scenario that you start with and a set of objectives to complete and you can spend your time re-arranging the hospital, improving the decor, training up the staff and getting things running well only to have it all reset at the start of the next mission. This is particularly jarring within a series where each episode is supposed to just be the next shift at the hospital. Still, once you get used to it you won't keep making that mistake again.\n\nThere's also some annoyances such as not being able to properly rotate the screen when you get to the edge of the hospital which makes it difficult to place items in those corners. Also the information screens are sorely lacking - it would be nice to see the laziness rating of the staff on the staff summary screen rather than having to click on every individual staff member one by one. And where's the financial info? Absolutely no financial data on profits / expenses etc which is odd.\n\nBut despite all of those negatives I'm actually going to give this game a thumbs up because in the end, I enjoyed playing it and it gave me about 12 hours of entertainment which is all that matters. However, I wouldn't pay full price for it.\n\nI would say that if you are looking specifically for a hospital game and can pick it up cheaply then do so but if you're looking for a sim / tycoon / management game in general and don't mind the genre then give it a miss as there are much better ones out there.","February 10, 2015","true","13.7"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

[e.g. when you need to pan down to the bottom of the aerial view 'map' of the hospital to be able to see where you can fit a new room, there are serious issues with being able to see to the edges. NB: This *can* sometimes be 'remedied' by rotating the camera around a few times - but that is only SOMETIMES!] Basically, if you are the kinda person to flip-tables and rage-quit over this sorta stuff, maybe it's best steering clear - for your own sanity ;P [personally, I soldiered on patiently...but it was still fairly painful at times :P]\nDepends on your humour: if you can't stand lame [meant to be self-affacing I think] jokes or cheesy parodying then maybe this isn't for you either! [I just kinda went with it, rolling my eyes to myself...by the end I actually produced a chuckle now and then...what has happened to me?!? hahlp.]\nAnd of course, the graphics are very dated and the character models/animation a bit awkward...but hey, that's to be expected right?\nSome could criticise it for being "just a Theme Hospital clone", and to be honest, it kinda is. [But what's wrong with that, when it's also ADDING to the previous style with some of the fun new bits and bobs mentioned above?]\n\nOverall, I picked this up for something like 89p if I remember correctly... And I *certainly* got well over 89p's-worth of value out of it! It was possible to sink a good few hours into this game and thoroughly enjoy the experience.\nPick yourself up a copy next time it's on sale, and surprise yourself with how much you can actually still enjoy a game that's pretty rough around the edges in places, a bit silly, but just downright fun :)!","September 23, 2014","true","14.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

The sims like noises the characters make when their dialog box pops up is atrocious. The game will freeze up every now and then for no reason. The minimal AI that is normally required in this type of game is horrible. I also don't think the developers had ever stepped foot in a hospital before they made this game.\nThe very core of the game is bad.\nDo not go into this game expecting it to be in any way similar to the great indie "tycoon" games that are on the market (such as Prison Architect, Game Dev Tycoon, etc.) because you will be sorely disappointed.\nIt's just... so bad. So terribly bad.\nIf you got this game from the Humble Bundle, do yourself a favor and don't download it. Use the 260 MB storage that you'll save for something better, like pictures of Al Gore or something.

This is not Theme Hospital. This is simply not very good. I have got some mild entertainment from it. It is painfully obvious that the goal was to create another Theme Hospital. Rather than improving or even meeting the standards of Theme Hospital, this is simply a fail IMO. A nice try, but a fail none the less. Give a go if you want, if you really loved Theme Hospital. It isn't too painfully expensive, and if you can catch it on sale it is worth a try to spend a couple of bucks on it in an attempt to relive the days of Theme Hospital if you think you may be so inclined.","June 29, 2014","false","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So far I am on Season 3 Episode 3 and am enjoying it in story mode.  It's not nearly as hard as Theme Hospital is.  However the only thing I can 100% guarantee you will want to do is turn off the sound.  When they talk it's the Sims gibberish and it just repeats over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over...\n\nThe graphics are not quite up there with Theme Hospital either but that is because Theme Hospital was Sprites while this went with a very early 3d model engine.  So the 3d models are not nearly as detailed or look as good as the sprites do.\n\nOverall I am quite enjoying my time with it.  Is it the classic that Theme Hospital is? Nope.  But it's a fun little romp through a soap opera Theme Hospital wannabe.","September 7, 2014","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I dislike this game, because the hospital in this game doesn't even look like a hospital. It's like a mix between a very small airport, a medical practice and a train station which has severe funding issues (but I guess funding issues come down to if you actually play this game or not).\n\nThe storyline is extremely short and is poorly written, and has nothing to do with running a hospital. There are more doctors and nurses in the 'hospital' than there are actual patients. I don't really mind the poor graphics due to how old this game is. The AI's who work at the 'hospital' don't do their jobs (as designed). Quite a few of the patients which had been admitted, died while either using the restroom or died on the way to get treated. I understand that the AI are poorly written and this game was released in 2007, but there have been other games that were released in 2007 which were no where near this level of awfulness. This game isn't unplayable but you probably won't enjoy it.\n\nEven though I received this game in a Humble Bundle, simply put, please don't buy this. It's not worth the money and effort to install even if you got it for a relatively good price. If you do end up purchasing this game, you'll probably end up requesting a refund from Steam.\n\nI rate this game (based on my experience of 20 minutes) - 1/10.","March 23","false","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would prefer a hospital game where I can control staff hours, wages, the types of tasks they can perform, break times, charges for each treatment per doctor. I would also make it more realistic and include plastic surgery and post surgery recovery time spent in the hospital bed. Throw in a cafe, job posting where I can list tasks, work schedule and skill requirements just to add more to the game.

The story is done by a scrolling text on the bottom of the screen which sometimes changes too quickly to read, and there is no voice acting in terms you'd expect. Instead they use a technique similar to Simlish so the game can be played in multiple languages. However, story mode is but a tutorial and the game seems well rounded in terms of mechanics and animation.\n\nThere are several aspects to the game mechanics and running a successful hospital hinges on being able to provide enough staff and equipment to deal with the influx of patients without going into the red, as well as keeping everyone happy. Happiness is determined by how much decoration is placed and there were times where it felt more like "Interior Design Tycoon". It's fairly easy as management sims go, but still enjoyable.\n\nI especially enjoyed discovering new diseases and putting new systems in place to treat them. The diseases are shown on collectible cards which show info on examination and treatment procedures. They are collected by researching someone with an unknown disease.\n\nOverall this game is great if you're looking for a management sim.","October 19, 2014","true","13.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is the only review I have written so far.\n\nI have music playing, and the noises the receptionist or whatever she is was still annoying me. I just turned the sound off and that wasn’t an issue any more.\n\nThe thing that gets me about this game was the main story mode. Sexy male ab workout guy can’t marry the nurse because of his dedication to the job. What compelled them to do something like that in a tycoon game? It is just extremely awkward especially for this kind of game.\n\nOn a side note, I wish some of this stuff was cured in one doctor visit.","February 19","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There isnt really much to say, the entire gameplay is in the game.\n\nPros:\nI've got nothing.\n\nCons:\nFeels like a rip off of an old game called Theme Hospital. Same idea of building hospital rooms and making your hospital better, however it seems less well implimented. When you complete an "episode" (which follows tired hospital drama tropes), all your progress is reset and new stuff is put in place instead.\nFollowing the last con, the game doesnt give you a sense of doing anything. Anything you accomplished in the last episode like building a new opperation room over the windows because why not is gone in the next episode.\nThe whole episode thing in general. The episodes are too short for me to like them as a feature. If the episodes were longer than like.... 10 minutes, it'd be good.\n\nFor a game that tries hard to be a ~*cool hospital drama*~ it even fails at that mark, making it a bland game to play. I'm surpised I managed to put as long as I did into it. If my purchase of this game hadnt of gone to charity I'd want a refund.","November 28, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought it would just be similar to the hospital (doctor career) in The Sims 4, but this game is even slower (very awkward control, indeed) and I hate it when I lost my modified room in the next episode. The only cool thing in this game is the first person view. The drama is horrible (trying to be Grey's Anatomy, but...). That's it. I can't even force myself to play for 2 hours.","October 23, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Patients will hang around waiting for doctors/nurses or equipment to be free so they can get tested. Even though everyone/thing is idle.\n\nOn the plus side, there aren't any stability bugs.
