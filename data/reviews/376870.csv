It is simple the game is filled with references to Minecraft, but that’s not the bad part. The bad part is that’s all it is, references there is no substance no engaging story no real narrative or characters you care about.\n\nThe first 30 minutes of the game is a brutal slog of uninspired writing and weak character building, comparatively to other Telltale titles.  The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, Tales From The Borderlands, and Game of Thrones are all vastly superior in the quality of characters, writing, and player engagement.\n\nTo expand on characters here is a list...\nThe Pig\nThe Fat Guy\nThe Girl\nThe Cool Girl\nThe Tunnel Snakes\nThe Nice Tunnel Snake\nLee EverettThe characters are bland and are given no real distinct or likable traits, making them unmemorable (see list) and near pointless to the story other than bouncing dialog off of.\n\nI purchased this game assuming that it would have the same quality that Telltale always delivers, but it did not. I have refunded my copy and a copy I gifted to a friend (On his request because its controls were broken). Hopefully this is not a sign that all future Telltale titles will become uninspired cash grabs but only time will tell.","October 13, 2015","false","1.8"," 2,342 of 3,261 people (72%) found this review helpful 308 people found this review funny","72","342","3","308","25"

You wouldn't criticize someone for being positive, so why on someone just because they have a negative opinion?\n\nTL;DL - Minecraft doesn't translate well into a Telltale game, "Telltale goes from HBO to Nickelodeon". Could've been something great but failed at the first hurdle.\n\nThis game isn't Minecraft. Nor is it Telltale. It doesn't feel like it anyway. There were moments when I was playing this and was thinking "This is a Minecraft game." and "This is a Telltale game.", and I just couldn't believe it.\n\nThe game begins by introducing all this new lore into Minecraft, and all this new Characters. It kind of just spits it all out and somehow expects you to take it all in some how. It would have been easier to understand if there was a stronger link between this game and the original Minecraft, but there just isn't. It would've just been as easy as having the pickable characters at the begining of the game being the 2 set characters we already know - Steve and Alex.\n\nWhen playing the game you feel as if you are watching a poor fan animation on youtube - Like someone trying to be like Element Animation but not quite. It falls into the un-canny valley - It's close to being a good looking animation while still looking like Minecraft, but it's just not quite there. It just feels un-natural. Also, the lip syncing in this game (for me) was annoyingly... weird. Rather than smooth mouth movements they used still mouth shapes that just jump to other mouth shapes when a different sound if pronounced. During the whole game I was just staring at their mouths because it just didn't look like they were really speaking at all.\n\nFinally, the game itself is clearly aimed at a younger audience, but Telltale have tried to give it the atmosphere found in their other games. In the Walking Dead you may have to save someone's life, and there is a real sense of threat as you know that if you fail they will die and you'll have to watch them get brutally murdered - Whereas in Minecraft Story Mode if you have to try and save someone you don't get a real sense of threat, you know that they aren't going to kill a character off in a kids game, and if they do it will be off-screen and clean. This means that I don't feel worried when I have to try and save someone as I know that in the end everything will be okay. Another thing I noted was that [Spoiler Alert]  you can try to make Lukas stay or you can let him leave. Now, as I noticed, he isn't actually mean to you at all at any moment in the game. While his gang will repeatedly harrass you, Lukas never actually does anything mean/horrible to you. Because I noticed this I made him stay as he is a good member of the team and he is actually a good guy. However, most people playing this game will be children, and to them they will just see him as just another one of the 'Mean Bullies' and while instantly make him leave. I know this as while I was looking at the stats of how people played the game after I saw that I was part of a small percentage (roughly 18% at the time) that actually made him stay.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend getting this game at the current price. If you do want to play it dispite what I've said then you should wait till it's atleast on sale. It's not the worst thing I've ever played, but Telltale really missed the mark on this one.\n\nEdit/Update:   Thank you everyone for your comments! I'm really sorry but I can't reply to anymore comments people are making. I've got a lot of stuff to do and as much as I'd love to reply to everyone it's starting to become a bit of a chore... x3\nAnyhow, thanks for everyone's comments and thoughts, it's been nice to discuss things in formal manner, and I don't think there was actually anyone who were critising me for being negative - Because that's so annoying >_< Anyways, Thank You everyone and have a great life ;)\n\nAlso! If you want to add me on Steam feel free! I'm always looking out for new friends ;)","October 17, 2015","false","5.1"," 1,533 of 2,209 people (69%) found this review helpful 123 people found this review funny","69","533","2","123","55"

It feels like a cash-in. It feels like Microsoft threw a big beefy contract at Telltales and said “Just do the usual”.\n\nAt first glance it may look like the usual fare: an impressive ensemble cast and a heavy lean on comedy but in actuality they've taken some big names, thrown them into a mixing bowl and hoped for the best.\n\nSome of the Actors are dreadful and either don’t understand voice acting or have had terrible direction. The plot - or as much as I absorbed - isn’t very interesting.\n\nIn a lot of ways it’s similar to existing Telltales games but instead of an engrossing story with memorable characters it’s a waste of effort on the developer's part and a waste of time on the player’s.","October 13, 2015","false","0.8"," 1,498 of 2,323 people (64%) found this review helpful 135 people found this review funny","64","498","2","135","46"

Because minecraft seemed like possible the worst IP to make a story based game around. However, I decided to give it a chance as so far Telltales borderlands which I also thought was a bad IP for telltale so far has been done surprsingly well. However my fears were confirmed this time. This is by far the worst Telltale game made yet and has so far and is bad enough to be a embarissment to their company. This game compared to all the other IPs they have purchesed in the past is the most obvious cash grab and Telltale was unfortnatlly not able to make the IP work with their game play style this time.\n\nThere are many negatives about this game...\n1. It has a very bland and predictable story line and charcters. In other games this would not be that big a deal however since telltale games are entierly story driven this really is a huge deal breaker.\n\n2. You have much less controll over what your charcter does and what they say than other telltale games. You will see obvious traps ahead and want to prevent them but will have no means to do so or wish for your charecter to do or say something different and not have the option to do it much more often than any other telltale game.  I understand that most telltale choices are only giving you a veil of choice however the veil in this game is way to easy to see through.\n\n3. The few big choices the game lets you make that actually make a bit of a difference are much easier and unimportant than the other telltale games. They do not make you have the feeling of regreting your choice as the other IPs have. Nor do they have me think about what choice to make and the possible consquences for at least a good 5 minates like some of the other IPs often do as the choices are not only easier but also seem less important.\n\n4. The game makes occsional minor mistakes in which skin for differnet items you should have forgetting your past choices which if followed you should have a different skin for that item.\n\nCurrnetly I would only recommend this game under 2 conditions.\n\n#1 You are one of the young zeolous minecraft fanatics and love anything that has anything to do with minecraft in which case you already purchased the game anyway so your pretty much only reading negative comments to defend it.\n\n#2 You are like me a telltale junkie and have already purchased all the other telltale games including similar games that are not telltale like life is strange and are desperate as hell waiting for more, have good amount of free time and disposable income. Even if that is the case I would recommend waiting for this to go on sale. I understand the need for telltales games crack but this is some low quality stuff that will barely keep you content.","October 13, 2015","false","22.7"," 755 of 1,175 people (64%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","64","755","1","41","6"

Oh my... well, screw that! My review still stands I will not play the other episodes because they have 0 to do with the main plot of the game that was advertised since day 1, so gg.\n\nThe game is finished! Wait, there is still another episode? And it has (basically) NOTHING to do with the plot in the first 4 episodes? Well then I won't review it. I will be making NO spoilers.\n\nBasically, if this game has taught me anything its that, Telltale will sure pump out episodes of something that they know will make more money then their other games and it shows. When I say pump out I mean in a month or less between episodes, and while that sounds cool it is ultimatley it's biggest flaw. To put it bluntly, this game pisses me off in a way few games can hope to.\n\nThere are some good things\nsome jokes (little that do) hit well and do make me chuckle.\nThe game runs well, it doesn't work well, but it runs well. I never dropped below 60 FPS on my PC which is a lot then what I can say for other games.\nThe final chapter (of the 24total chapters) is really interesting and is probaly the best of some of Telltale's entire library.\nThe introduction to Episode 3 is great, action packed and really fun to watch unfold.\n\nThe absolute biggest fault that Minecraft: Story Mode has is the pacing. It is god awful. Episode 1 is paced well, Episode 2 is 50 minutes of nothing. Episode 3 is better in pacing, but still has serious pacing issues in the 2nd half. Episode 4 finally, starts off way too fast, slows down way too hard, and ends off steadily luckily. Some times it goes absolutly at lightning speed through a story important segment, then focuses on something that has little to do with the main serious plot just to have "Character development" which is basically the 3 bullet points that are repeated over and over again.\n\nThe choices don't matter. There are choices, and while some of them "do change the game" (by that I mean some small dialogue changes and only ONCE does it take you elsewhere, only to end up where both choices meet up) they don't change it enough to really matter, or really care.\n\nThe writing is dreadful.\nJokes, even with the little ones that hit, are bad. Some jokes have great potental, but then they feel that they need to point out EVERY. SINGLE. LITTLE. INSTANCE. OF. THAT. JOKE. Which kills the joke. They also think that they need to tell you when to laugh, when Jesse (Your character) just smirks as if you were laughing, every, time, they, make, a, joke.)\n\nMultiple times, especially in the last episode, there are just constant exposition dumps which are really lazy. Instead of woving in the past of the Order of the Stone well, they instead opt to tell you a story then basically quiz you over it covered up by a "puzzle" which is just a quiz.\n\nThe characters are cookie cut outs; The everyman, smart boy, popular guy with a good heart, the fat guy, they all are here and it really hurts me WANTING to like the characters. They are attempted to be fleshed out, however it is extremley cookie cutter progression that leaves the player bored.\n\nThe plot is ok, but there obveously was either too much or too little so the writing glosses over things that should have been expanded upon, however they never were. The major problem with the plot is even with the glossing over segments, the whole danger of the Wither Storm doesn't feel like Danger. Its like a game shows a monster consistantly and says its doing a lot but you never really see anything first hand. It also doesn't help that the Mineraft world is practically endless, even stated in this game so there is no reason why we shouldn't believe that the Wither Storm isn't going to mess up the world ever after seeing how its done almost nothing visual for us.\n\nGlitches are everywhere\nThe game runs well, however it does look well. There are graphical glitches everyone (character models clipping through themselves, and each other. Some blocks are stuck into each other which has a weird clipping effect. And one character, Ivor's, beard has that same effect (at least for Episodes 1-3) which is distracting and kills the imersion in some cases. you fight a Witch at one point with arrows, and the arrows "stick" to the witch, and I swear I could make a more convincing looking sticking arrow animation in Source Filmmaker in 5 minutes then this multiman team did in 1 month.\n\nMultiple times (especially in Episode 2) characters cut eachother off mid sentence in a very "didn't mean to do that" manner. Which makes it appear as a glitch (if it wasn't trying to be one)\n\nNot Very Kid Friendly\nPeople constantly say that this game is for little kids, so cut it a break. Well no. I will not. This game is rated E10 for ages 10 and older, not only that but they also curse multiple times in this game (I have no problem with this, however a game that is aimed at little kids that curses is not really in parents best interests.) They say "What the hell" 3 times, "Damn" once, "freaking" (bad depending on what you think) multiple times, and they call characters "tools" once. There are probaly other instances but it really isn't great for a game aimed at little kids.\n\nGameplay is really bad (when it tries to be action packed)\nThe "combat" is awful. You are required to fight enemies at least once, what it delves down to is you holding the key to move right and spam clicking your mouse, which could be argued that it was like that in regular Minecraft, however this is a new style of bad combat. You do nothing.\n\nThe Music is mediocre\nSometimes it fits, other times it sounds like it was trying to replicate the Minecraft style of music but missed the biggest point, pianos. You see, Minecraft Story Mode's soundtrack recycles itself to an annoying point throughout the 6 hour campaign. The official Minecraft soundtrack is great (atleast the Volume Alpha and the Nether Tracks from the Volume Beta album) however, it seems that the composers (no beef with them) did not know what made Minecraft's iconic soundtrack iconic and instead went for an attempted replication that makes it sound souless and not in the least bit listenable for anything else then what the listener is fored to.\n\nOverall Minecraft: Story Mode is a cash crab that tries at some points, but fails on most others. From the dull plot, poor writing, not very kid friendly vibe, awful combat, and glitches galore it is clear that Telltale either wanted money quickly, or knew that this was a mistake and rushed out everything as fast as possible. I recomend a pass and don't play this game.\n3.5/10\n\nEpisode 1: 7/10\nEpisode 2: 2.3/10 (No joke)\nEpisode 3: 4.8/10\nEpisode 4: 5.3/10","October 30, 2015","false","6.3"," 581 of 953 people (61%) found this review helpful 58 people found this review funny","61","581","953","58","38"

But I beg to differ, I personally think Minecraft is suitable for all ages. For anyone who wants to have a game where they can explore a world full of mysteries, where they can put their creativity to work.\n\nYou guys have no idea how many messages I got from people saying like "ehhrmageerrdd you're playing Minecraft what are you, 10 years old???" as I was playing this game..\nThe point I'm trying to make is that, people tend to have misconceptions about Minecraft itself just because it's known for having somewhat cancerous fanbase filled with immature kids. It's kind of sad that this is why people aren't interested in it because Minecraft: Story Mode is a fantastic and fresh experience from Telltale Games.\n\nSo many people were sh*tting on this game before the first episode had even launched just for the sake of it being a Minecraft game. And you know what? I thank those people for giving me the wrong idea of this game, because of that my expections were low and oh man was I blown away with what I got.\n\nI'm very biased when it comes to Telltale Games but don't worry, I'm not going to try and say this game was flawless.\nI think I've been rambling long enough now, time to actually review the bloody game.\n\n---SKIP TO HERE IF YOU CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO READ THROUGH MY JIBBERING NONSENSE---\nPROS:- Voice-acting\n- Action sequences\n- Atmospheric Soundtrack\n- Choices do actually MATTER\n- It stays true to the Minecraft world\n- Characters are all very likeable in my opinion\n- Animations have improved and look lot smoother than in previous Telltale titles\n- Opening credit scenes are very well done and highly entertaining for each episode\n- Emotionally very touching even if it is lot more toned down from the previous Telltale titles like "The Walking Dead"\n\nNEUTRAL:- Not as many puzzles as you might expect\n- Ambiance constantly switching from funny to depressing\n- The game's filled with clichés and so are the characters. But you know what, it actually isn't that bad.\n( The characters are all unique compared to each other and likeable in their own ways. )\n\nCONS:- Quite a lot of bugs ( especially in Episode 2 which was honestly borderline unplayable. )\n- Some actions of the main / side characters feel very off and it feels like they've become completely different characters\n- Episode 2 was extremely short and honestly a total mess when it came to the dialogue and overall script\n- Dialogue is bit awkward and cringey at some points\n- Certain scenes felt very rushed but this is honestly with every narrative Telltale game I've played\n- Many people have lost their save files including myself but this is not necessarily to blame the game itself for it\n\nOverall it's the most light hearted Telltale title there is, with some depressing moments but mostly it's just your stereotypical comedy slash adventure tale about a group of friends trying to save the world,\nset in the world of Minecraft of course.\n\nHonestly, if you've already played Minecraft and you know there's nothing appealing for you about it, you might want to skip this one. This also applies if you absolutely cannot stand clichés,\ngeneric characters or generic storylines for that matter.\n\nThe story isn't among its strongest features but the characters, the dialogue, the overall gameplay are.\n\nI really enjoyed it. I'm very easy to please though, all I need is that the game touches me emotionally and manages to make me actually care for the characters and about what happens to them. I've never cried for a pig before.\n\nIt was a thrilling ride, throughout the game I smiled, I laughed,\nI shed some tears and I was angry.\nThis is exactly what I want from a videogame.

I mean, I like Minecraft I suppose. But I'm not a hardcore fanboy. I am however a huge fanboy for Telltale games. However this game feels way off the beaten path from Telltale's engaging style, and feels more like playing through a Saturday morning cartoon.\n\nI would caution the seasoned Telltale player that if you're looking for a deep, engaging story, that pulls at your heart and makes you deal with some serious tragedy and strife, that this is not at all your game.\n\nHowever if you're a fan of Minecraft and want a more casual, lighthearted story, this might be for you.

It's so far from everything they've ever done.\n\nI hate to use the term but, I think this is what selling out looks like.","October 13, 2015","false","4.4"," 275 of 474 people (58%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","58","275","474","11","2"

First of all, I haven't played episode four. Not gonna play it anyway, so I don't care anymore. At first I was hopeful about this game. I knew it wouldn't have the dark tone of the other telltale games but still I looked forward to it, and just now, I realize I was wrong. I won't even bother to mention the language problems with it. If you're not an english speaker, don't even bother to get this game. If you choose another language that's not english, the game will choose another language which is not the one you chose.\n\nNow that I got that off my chest, I'll say my real problem with this game. I don't care about any of the characters, the only character that grew into me sightly is Ivor and he's not even that of a major character. All of them are plain and stereothyped in my opinion, and you know what? maybe I'm wrong, but that's what I feel. Why am I supposed to care about all these people?\n\nThe story is just... nothing. It's cliche, I can't tell how many times I've seen a story like this in movies, books and other games. I know this game is supposed to be for all ages, so the story can't be dark, but I don't ask for a dark story, I ask for an interesting one.  Don't get me wrong, a story can contain cliches, but it also needs original stuff to make it something different, and this is what Minecraft: SM doesn't have. It gives nothing new to the industry nor the players.\n\nChoices may matter a bit, yeah, but at what cost? If the story is bad, I don't care if the choices matter or not. I'm dissappointed, and I was wrong when I was hopeful about this game. I mean no offense to the people who liked it, but I didn't. It doesn't have a good story, it doesn't have interesting characters, the graphics are bad, the gameplay is non existant. And yes, I know Telltale games have non existant gameplay, but at the same time, those telltale games at least have an interesting story, so the lack of gameplay isn't noticeable. In MCSM it is noticeable because the story is awful. If it doesn't have a good story, at least it should have something else to like.

You can see that the universe is implemented very well into the game. There are a few knicks here and there the game was overall pretty much like Minecraft.\n\nThe style/system the game was developed on is a pretty common system that you can find on many games. Walk around and click what you'd like to interact with. I'm not very familiar with Telltale games but I am familiar with quite a few general titles.\n\nThe storyline at some points were predictable but overall has a nice plot and I can't wait to see the next episodes. I can already see many people foreshadowing different episodes and stuff.\n\nThe Bad\nThis game became very over-hyped with all its advertisements. It did look like an exciting game with a different style to it, but the game was almost too basic. It might just be me, but I felt that this Episode was absolutely short. Like I said, I'm not too familiar with Telltale games so whether or not they keep their games this short, it is not really worth the $22.50-$25.\n\nThough the story was quite interesting and the choices you can make help develop the game, the playtime is rather short. Most of the story is watching the story and making choices. There isn't much walking around or fighting mobs.\n\nAt some points in the story, it seemed almost predictable. I understand the game audience may not be people 18 and older, but if you're gonna play any game the excitement draws from the astonishment.\n\nConclusion\nThis game was indeed fun and does have a very interesting story. Sadly, the game was very short and did not have much play time. I completed this game in a few hours. It could have been faster but you can't skip the cutscenes.\n\nOverall, this game is fun. BUT I do not believe it is worth the money. Telltale seemed to have created this because Minecraft is such a popular title and they saw the potential cash grab.\n\nNevertheless, if you would like to play this game, be my guest. It was fun and interesting and well worth the few hours I spent on it. But if you have been contemplating on the price of this game with its worth, I would suggest not. $25 is not worth it.","October 14, 2015","false","3.9"," 223 of 393 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","223","393","6","5"

It follows the traditional Telltale recipe of an interactive movie, but feels a little bit forced.\n\nPROS\nIt's a Minecraft game\nGreat soundtrack\nDevs that seem to have a decent sense of humor\nCONS\nIt doesn't really feel like a Minecraft game. For one thing, it does that 90's adventure game thing where the environments are one fixed screen that your character has to move around in, which really doesn't lend itself to the sandbox atmosphere of Minecraft.\nQuick time events. Everything you do that doesn't involve moving the mouse is a quick time event. They really could have been more creative.\nUGH THE CAMERA (See bullet point number 1)\nThe puzzles are to easy and too few. In the first episode, for example, there are only TWO PUZZLES. One of the puzzles, you just have to talk to someone, and the other is so easy to figure out that I accidentally solved it while trying to figure out what the puzzle even was.\nThey try (unsuccessfully) to work crafting into the game. The interface is clunky (right clicking, dragging, and all of that smooth Minecraft stuff won't work) and you can only make very limited things at very specific times. In fact, crafting is only used three times in the first episode, and it's only when it's necessary to move the story forward.\nShallow characters. The biggest thing about a story-based game is the character development, which simply does not exist in this game. The only interesting character in the entire game is Reuben the Pig. All of the other characters are simply archetypes and nothing else.\nFive minutes of credits at the end.\nThe opening credits don't start until the end of Chapter 1.\nThe story doesn't make sense. SPOILER: Ivor has the same goal as you -- stopping the Wtiherstorm and saving the world. But the whole time, he is trying to stop you as well, something that makes no sense whatsoever.\nAnd on top of all that, it doesn't even have trading cards.","October 19, 2015","false","1.9"," 312 of 560 people (56%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","56","312","560","30","3"

Interaction is minimal, I would hardly even call it a game. There's no skill involved, other than pressing arrow keys at correct times when it flashes on your screen. Most of the choices for the player come in the form of dialogue options, but none seem to have much of an impact on the game.

This game could have been one of the greatest creations in computing history, what with two of the most popular gaming names behind it. It failed. Unlike in Telltale's Game of Thrones, where I can never wait for the next chapter and play it all the way through the day it comes out, and unlike in Minecraft, where there's always something else to do even in Vanilla, this game has neither aspect. Although it does have an interesting storyline for a non-storyline-based game, the characters are rather cliche and boring, it's extremely child-friendly with none of the tension or emotions of Telltale's previous successes and they have ruined the greates (in my opinion) enemy a sandbox game has ever seen (More later).\n\nI'll start on the animation. Although this game is based off of something with no communication or cutscene programming whatsoever, this game is probably better off to keep it that way. The animations seem too cartoony for a supposedly dramatic storyline and it ruins the atmosphere. The mouths ingame are too simplistic and are more like something you would find in a very old, very amateur, Windows '95 era game with only different mouth shapes for each sound.\n\nSecondly, the characters. [Spoiler Alert] You have the cliche main character=leader, brutish-looking guy is intimidating but a bit dim and actually soft on the inside, the girl is intelligent and usually/always knows the best thing to do (even if everyone ignores her), the badass side character who comes in to save the day and becomes a main character, and the bully who learns his lesson and makes friends with the main character. This makes them very predictable and extremely boring.\n\nThirdly, the villain/enemy/boss, whatever you want to call it. [Spoiler Alert] The Wither is supposed to be an extremely powerful, 3-headed, flying creature, which I grant, it is. It does NOT, however, consume anything to evolve and grow. The Wither Telltale have given us here, to put simply, looks ridiculous. Just the look of it ruins the whole idea of it in actual Minecraft. It looks silly, and overdone, and nothing like the Wither at all. It does not have tentacles that reach out and grab people and blocks, it is supposed to throw a toxic-like ball at the people of Minecraftia with the destruction of blocks being collateral damage. This monstrosity (the bad context) is an insult to the Wither I, and maybe we, have come to know and fear.\n\nAll in all, this game had huge potential and I was extremely excited to see what they would do, and hugely disappointed. The game is the worst it could have been, with all the negative aspects of each Telltale and Minecraft, not the greatness within each. I shall complete it, but only because I don't like leaving anything unfinished, even this, and, as said, the storyline is, albeit only just, decent.\n\n\nThanks for reading.

Episode 2-5 will come in the months to follow. Depending on if people are reading this review, expect an update by then.\n\nAlright guys, let's get this over with before you keep on reading.\nThis is not a game where you can run around freely.\nThis is not a game where you can build your own buildings.\nThis is not a game where you survive.\n\nIt's not like Minecraft.\n\nDon't expect an experience you had while playing Minecraft. This is a whole different kind of game.\nBut is it bad?\n\nShort answer: No, definitely not.\n\nYou might not be familiar with TellTale games. If that's the case, then allow me to briefly explain what you can expect here. Like the name suggests, this game tells a tale. It is as if you're watching a movie, but with you as the main character. You're watching, meaning for the majority of the time, you're sitting back and watching the story unfold. But at the same time, you're the main character. That means you'll be able to talk for the main character, and sometimes play short scenes with him. But that's it. Now if this is your first TellTale game, then this might sound weird, and not very fun.\n\nAlright, if you're familiar with TellTale, then start reading here, because this is where the 'tale' part comes in. In the beginning of the review I told you it's not like Minecraft. Or at least, it doesn't deliver an experience you might expect from a Minecraft game. Like I said, there's no building. No surviving. No exploring... But there's a tale. As this game's title suggests, it's a 'Story Mode'. A tale in the Minecraft universe. And believe me when I say, the tale is great. Sure, it's not for everyone, but as someone who has played lots of Minecraft in the past, I can say it really fits in the game's universe, and the story itself is also really well made. I'm being careful not to spoil anything here though, so I'll have to stop there.\n\nIf you need a more detailed review on the story itself, then check out other reviews on this game. My goal was to "warn" you that this game might not be what you think it is.","October 13, 2015","true","10.0"," 565 of 1,049 people (54%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","54","565","1","38","27"

The reason I say that is because I am not a massive Minecraft enthusiast nor am I someone that dislikes the game. I'm just an individual who loves playing games and reviewing them, if the games good i'll like it but if it is not I won't. Therefore my stance is completely unbiased going into this game. This is also my first experience with TellTale which is rather new for me. I will update my post when every new episode comes out.\n\nEPISODE 1:\nThe game surprised me with its focus that was primarily on voice actors and cutscenes, Both of which were absolutely outstanding. The voice acting cast for this game was talented and the effort put into every line of dialogue was full of impact. Cut scenes were graphically impressive and held a consistent frame rate, I found the lack of gameplay to be surprising though. The gameplay was most comparable to The Order:1886, sometimes it only took for you to walk from one end of a hall way to another to finish your section and then proceed to watch another 5-10 minutes of cutscenes.\n\nThe game is mostly a point and click adventure with a bit of walking, making choices and clicking on things is all you do for the most part. The choice making is very much like Until Dawn in that what you say will effect the people around you and what you do will possibly change the whole scenario for the worse. This was incredibly effective and one of the first games ive ever played where I felt my choices actually mattered compared to games like Life Is Strange or Until Dawn where sometimes you would tell the charector to do one thing and then they'd end up doing the other anyway.\n\nOverall as a game that played out as more of a rather interactive movie rather than a video game it was quite good. If you just want to sit back and enjoy yourself this is worth your money BUT I must address the one major con to the game that goes out of it's way to beat you over the head which was the button mashing (quick time events). The placing for quick time events were frequent but incredibly awkward which sometimes lead you to cheap deaths.\n\nInstead of hitting, collecting and creating houses and forts to live in you just bashed the "Q" button and watched the players do it themselves which was a real head scratcher concidering the franchise. I almost feel that the term "Minecraft: Story Mode" was not appropriate for this game, just because it would have been better off as a spin off game (and gotten way much less hate)\n\nConclusion: Effective choices, Fun and graphically impressive cutscenes, a compelling story, AMAZING voice actors but absolutely awful choices were made in regards to quick time events and taking the core element of the original games gameplay entirely out of this experience.\n\nEpisode 2:\n\nI've been reluctant to continue doing these reviews because an obnoxious young minority who haven't even played the game have been very persistant in knocking down anything good said about this title because it is seemingly different to what they expected. I am doing them though so people don't get misinformed.\n\nThis episode homed right in on character development and also introduced a few new notable plot points but overall didnt progress the story as much as it could've. Once again the game runs beautifully and the voice acting is outstanding. This game reeled in some of the best voice actors in the industry and the pay off was brilliant. Props going mostly to the voice of Petra. Petra has one of the most unique and well fitted voices I've seen in a long time.\n\nBesides the again suprisingly thorough choices and consequences aswell as bright, impressive visuals, this episode didn''t have as much to offer. Combat and interaction with the WASD keys were less frequent and there was alot of watching going on. This would have been more okay if the episode wasn't so alarmingly and quickly cut off (it was very short).\n\nThe times that you were constructing or in combat were really fun and I had a blast going through quick time events or hitting enemies when the time came around, but the game did a good job of leaving you wanting more.\n\nOverall: This episode wasn't great but it certaintly wasn't bad. A short and quick run through some fresh ideas aswell as running/playing smoothly in the process.\n\nEpisode 3:\nWow, the devs certainly listened to the only lukewarm reviews for the second episode. The sophomore ep was not bad but it was a little short and the interact ability was way less frequent than in the previous episode. This episode is by far the best out of the three, being the most juicy, most exiting, most interactable and most enticing of all.\n\nThe pacing and story was executed far better than the previous 2 episodes and most episodes from any episodic game. Being longer than the second episode and just the right size, Episode 3 was capable of establishing a GREAT opening sequence, character development (LOTS OF CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT :D), a solid climax, an unexpected plot twist and a satisfying yet nail biting ending. It ends on a cliffhanger .\n\nEvery already introduced character had their chance at one point or another to teach you as a player a large amount about them. Their intentions, the way they think and what there is to know about them. The game left more scenarios where you could just talk to the characters not for plot progession but just for a little more insight on the individual. This made the game feel far more real and made you want to do something to help these people because you care about them. The dialogue was written exceptionally well ( more so than previous episodes ) having the characters react the way an actual person would given the situation.\n\nThe gameplay was great also, the actual gameplay has been the only seriously problematic weak link of the "Minecraft: Story Mode". Luckily, this issue has been fixed with this episode was exiting to play more so than a lot of other games I have even played this year. Using the mechanics they have established since episode 1 and using them in such an effective manner you may even want to play this episode twice in one sitting.\n\nThe story was INCREDIBLE. What they have created within this Minecraft world and what they have implemented that was already existing from the Minecraft world is mind boggling. The plot went upwards 150% in this episodes and you feel like you got every cent of your moneys worth for 5 episodes in this 1 episode alone. The only irritating part about the story is that they spent a little too long focusing on the Enderman and that broke the pacing/exitment a little as it wasn't very interesting. Oh, and again I will stress HOW AWESOME THE VOICE ACTING IS OMAGERSH IT IS AWESOME.\n\nOverall: If you were on the fence about buying this game THIS should completely intrigue you into getting it. This was amazing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode 4:\n(To be released)\n\nEpisode 5:\n(To be released)","October 15, 2015","true","5.5"," 366 of 683 people (54%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","54","366","683","45","20"

Barring the fact that I had a blue-screen mid stream (Crashes happen, although while streaming they are very painful).\n\n** Issue #1 ** Significantly too short.  I finished the episode in 1:30.  That includes the time it took me to crash, restart, load up my stream, and resume playing and replay through from my last auto-save...  If the remaining episodes will be included free as part of the $22 I spent on this, then it may be worth the price, but having to wait to play a game in full when I was under the impression that it was a full game, not an "early release"...\n\n** Issue #2 **  Not NEARLY enough time to make choices.  I sometimes clicked at the last second and it didn't register, or spent 2 seconds looking at chat to look back and realize I missed a decision point.  I guess the game is so short I can do it over...\n\n** Issue #3 ** Besides dialogue, there was no other choice.  In fact, the "challenges" were button-mashing (PRESS Q A BUNCH OF TIMES REALLY FAST) or the occasional "DDR-Lite" where you have to press A, S, D, or W to avoid an attack.  At best it was an interactive cut-scene where I occasionally did button mashing.  Far cry from being able to freely build whatever I want in minecraft...\n\n** Issue #4 ** I mis-clicked on character creation.  I couldn't go back, I couldn't undo, I was stuck with the character I selected.  I even tried the "go back a menu" and it wouldn't let me go back.  SO, when picking a character MAKE SURE YOU PICK THE ONE YOU WANT.\n\n** What I actually Liked ** I didn't hate the experience, just had lots of issues.  The story was "OK" although the story tries to carve you out as a weak and uncool kid, which makes all the "I'm awesome and kickass" dialogue options seem extremely out of place (even though I chose them, because I'm awesome and kickass).  I DID want to continue playing.  When the credits rolled I was left with two feelings: "HOLY CRAP IT'S OVER, WTF, THIS WAS JUST BARELY AN HOUR" and "WHY IS THE NEXT EPISODE HERE"  But for $22 I could have bought an entire TV season of Doctor Who and had 12+ hours of entertainment, whereas I got 1 1/2 hours of entertainment here and a sore finger (from mashing the Q button, BTW - Telltale, you owe me a new Q button).\n\nOverall - I'd say DO NOT BUY until all the episodes are out.  Unless you like playing the same game over and over and over, because thats the only way you'll get value out of this.","October 14, 2015","false","2.3"," 156 of 289 people (54%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","54","156","289","11","4"

And this is the first time I've met with a Telltale product. I did not know what to expect but I could see good potential in the concept. Unfortunately it became a terrible disappointment pretty much from the first minute.\n\nThe plots are stupid, the conversations are boring. Overall the complexity of the story can make anyone above the age of 10 do self-harm after a couple of minutes. The whole flow of the game (interactive movie?) is painfully slow.\n\nOn the rare occasions when your character gets some freedom to act and not just talk crap you realise that the controls are horrible and the world is very linear. Otherwise it's just all talking and selecting your response in a timely manner. The later kills whatever immersion you may (not) have as you need to focus on picking your answer before the time is up, while the others are still talking. Speaking of which, dialog choices detemine the storyline and add dynamism to the gameplay. I can see how that could work, pity I can't force myself to replay the choices just to get a slightly different dumb version of the dialogs.\n\nNot sure what's the intention with this product. It's not a good game as there's pretty much nothing to do in it. Action scenes require the pressing/smashing of one of the 5 control keys within given time. Not that too much action would be required, it's more about not missing those random moments - which again breaks immersion. Fights look awkward and unrealistic even in the standards of Minecraft.\n\nIt's not a good movie cause the lack of real plots and twists, at least ones that would get the attention of a 5th-grader or higher. Dialogs are poor and cheesy and everything's happening very slow. Could be al-right for kids, but the age range who could enjoy it the most may require parental guidance during some scenes.\n\nIt does not have stunning visuals... hey, it's Minecraft at its basics after all. And it does not have stunning acting either...\n\nOverall it's some good money wasted with regrets in hindsight.","October 13, 2015","false","3.1"," 165 of 307 people (54%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","54","165","307","10","0"

I need to wind down. Minecraft: Story Mode was the perfect game to fill this niche. Conjuring a story for a game that is known for not having one can be a tall order, but with the framework that was given. Telltale really pulled out the begining of what seems to be a very charming narrative. I know guys don't crucify me, charming is a buzzword used often. But this game is it CHARMING, in all caps!\n\nPros: -Visuals are great, makes Mincraft feel soulful.\n-Some of the best voice acting you will come across in a game. Paton Oswalts performance as Jesse is special.\n-CHARMING(IKR) Narrative\n-End choice will greatly affect episode 2's direction.\n-Crafting things you are not supposed to make.\n-Rueben is my best friend.\n\nCons:-Puzzles are non-exsistent.\n\nClosing Statements:\nMinecraft: Story Mode is not a perfect game nor is it flawed. For what it tries to do it does it well. A nice blend of family friendly humor with all of the Telltale decision making. With a Disney esque coming of age story also at play. As it stands, considering how these episodic games can change, I highly recommend this game to everyone who is looking for a heart warming tale of friendship and growing up while maintaining the Telltale spirit.\n\n★░░░░░░░░░░░████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░░░███░██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░░░██░░░█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░░░██░░░██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░░░░██░░░███░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░░░░░██░░░░██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░░░░░██░░░░░███░░░░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░░░░░░██░░░░░░██░░░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░███████░░░░░░░██░░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░███░██░░░░░░★ ★░░░██░░░░░████░░░░░░░░░░██████░░░░░★ ★░░░██░░████░░███░░░░░░░░░░░░░██░░░░★ ★░░░██░░░░░░░░███░░░░░░░░░░░░░██░░░░★ ★░░░░██████████░███░░░░░░░░░░░██░░░░★ ★░░░░██░░░░░░░░████░░░░░░░░░░░██░░░░★ ★░░░░███████████░░██░░░░░░░░░░██░░░░★ ★░░░░░░██░░░░░░░████░░░░░██████░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░██████████░██░░░░███░██░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░░░██░░░░░████░███░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░░░█████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░★","December 3, 2015","true","4.9"," 253 of 474 people (53%) found this review helpful 63 people found this review funny","53","253","474","63","21"

More often than not, you'll find yourself faced with quicktime events that offer little to no consequences for failure, dialogue options which offer no impact on the game itself, and, sometimes, choices which at the time seem like they'll influence the game reasonably only to find out the option you didn't choose gets resolved some way or another outside of your experience.\n\nYet all of this could be acceptable as a part of a game that at least offers an interesting story as the concept of Telltale Games is to have to experience a story which you can hopefully be at least mildly invested in. This fails in a herculean fashion. Characters are presented as important and deep when in reality, they are injected suddenly and unemotionally into the story while the plot itself is generic and often lazily progressed. This means that whenever you're faced with Telltale's trademark "important decision" moments, you really don't have much to go off of emotionally making the choice meaningless and easy.\n\nEven as a children's game, this fails across the board for ham-fisted attempts at sudden and awkward humour, lack of any interesting story or character development, and an overall absence of the emotional investment present in...some...of Telltale's other games, for even games for children can still retain objective elements of entertainment.

With its unique storyline and damn good graphics, it's sure to entertain you... for a week. Being a Telltale Games point-and-click style of gameplay only takes you a certain length because there's only 5 or more chapters. It's true that every story has to end, but being a numero uno popularo on the App Store always has a lot of players asking for more. Mojang and Telltale should really think of adding more episodes after the additional three, otherwise that'll suck, and they should probably stop thinking of charging more for every 3 new episodes. Seriously, that kinda sounds like they're ripping people off, because they sell the first five episodes for around 15 bucks and the next three for around 12?!?!Anyways, it's still a good game.","May 9","true","7.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","4"

The reason I have a slight disliking for this game is because it doesn't truly represent Minecraft. Although it contains some staples of Minecraft such as mobs, landscape, and the nether/end, the story doesn't truly relate to Minecraft. When I think of a Minecraft story mode, I'd immediately think of an explanation to the actual game, not some random plot associated to the game for no reason. I'd have much more respect for this game if it wasn't tied to Minecraft since I did enjoy the story itself and the characters. As for the gameplay, the controls and camera angles weren't the best as they were very clunky and stiff. Sometimes there isn't enough time to read the options of what you can say in response to characters when they are talking either. Plus, there were many noticeable glitches throughout the game. Overall, the game itself was fine but I can't say it's a good game since it is supposed to resemble Minecraft but does an extremely poor job doing so. This game seems like Telltale's way of advertising their story by using a popular name such as Minecraft to market their game and trick people to buying what they would think is an add-on to Minecraft. If you're looking for a fun little game to play on a boring day, this game is for you. If you're a Minecraft fan, I don't recommend you play this game since it's not what it is claiming to be.","February 20","false","6.9"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","14","24","0","2"

That's not really a problem though, since I guess that kind of story is expected out of a Minecraft game since it's kind of marketed towards kids these days. What is a problem though is the way the story is set up. Now I'm going to spoiler it up because people get salty about these things or whatever, but it doesn't really anything from the story -  Basically you have 4 episodes of the main story and then you have the 5th which is obviously a part of a different story which were announced to be episodes 6-8 on the release of said 5th episode.. Basically they sold an incomplete product as you would expect to get the full game experience WHEN YOU PAID THE FULL PRICE OF THE GAME. Also the story is very inconsistent. Like the guy you are supposed to hate suddenly becoming your best friend for no apparent reason inconsistent.\n\nOther than that everything's as you would expect from a telltale game - essentially a FMV (movie) style game with QTEs thrown in where the story is effectively defined by your choices. Sadly in this one your choices don't really culminate much in anything, as no matter what you choose the outcome will be the same (with very minor differences that don't really matter at all). If previous Telltale games culminated with your choices playing a part in the ending, in this one the choices just kinda happens and no long matter 5-10 minutes after the choice's been made (I suppose sometimes some insignificant dialogue changes in the next episode or something).\n\nAnd when playing do disable telltale's cloud saving. It has a tendency of losing save data and then syncing your old saves from before-previous session over your saves causing lost progress.","May 6","false","14.2"," 34 of 63 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","34","63","4","0"

This is my first interest in a game from this studio and I'm thuroughly un-impressed over all. This is honestly the first game I have ever found so terrible that I have asked for a refund on. The story is incredibly corny and you can play though it in just over an hour. At the current price, it is completely un-acceptable. The game looked beautiful but that does not make up for a 20.00+ price tag on a game that can be completed in under 2 hours and no side stuff to do to allow you to even extend this game. Do not get this game unless you want to watch a childrens movie and only progress by pushing buttons every once in a while. Esentially, its a game that forces you to pay attention to continue.

When you tell a story in a game your game can become linear, a way to counteract this is to add things along your journey such as secrets and minigames which make the game more enjoyable. Telltale completly left out everything non-linear and because of this I rate this game:\n\n3/5 for story\n0/5 for gameplay\n1/5 for graphics\n\nDon't get me wrong the idea is good, many games have succeeded using movie aspects to build a great game but the execution of actual gameplay must be present, and Telltale games failed to provide even a sliver of imersion into the game.","October 14, 2015","false","1.7"," 22 of 41 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","22","41","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/greenpebble/recommended/376870/","greenpebble","TILEY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/greenpebble/","77 products in account","NB: This review is for episodes 1-5, as currently episodes 6-8 have been announced as purchasable DLC #ElectronicArts\n\nMinecraft Story Mode is TellTale's latest episodic adventure in which we play as a young aspiring hero named Jesse, accompanied by a group of friends, who's mission is to reunite the long-lost Order of the Stone to help save the World. Without spoiling anything or revealing too much, the adventure takes them to various wonderous and dangerous places in order to find the lost members of the Order and defeat an evil entity. This is concluded by the end of episode 4 which felt short lived, and episode 5 is the first chapter of a new adventure for our heroes which will be continued in the DLC (sneaky plans TellTale). I was extremely excited for this game as I am a huge TellTale and Minecraft fan, but sadly I was left dissapointed. While the story was fairly well written the subtitles were not, there were even stages where the subtitles said something completely out of context while the characters were speaking. There are also some story blunders, the worst being when a character who had repeatedly caused trouble for the group returns in secret to speak to Jesse, once accepted by Jesse he is brought to the group but they all seem to have forgotten what he has done and accept him without questions or an apology. The story falters at other stages too especially in the choices: there was always a choice A and a choice B but then also a choice C which was practically choice A and B combined, and the obvious best choice. This is just plain lazy and not what should be expected and accpeted from TellTale. Their games are supposed to make me value my choices and think clearly before I decide, Minecraft Story Mode failed at this.\n\nPros:\n- It's Minecraft, I'm a nerd\n- There are various customisation options throughtout the game making you feel more involved\n- The lanscapes and buildings are beautifully done (in Minecraft standards obviously)\n- Endings are somehwhat suspensful\n- Episode 5 did have some redeeming features\n- I was kind of sad at certain stages, TellTale usually leaves me in a state of depression though (therefore also a Con)\n\nCons:\n- Music becomes repetitive and annoying\n- Graphical glitches that are easy to notice and fix\n- Subtitle inconsistency\n- Story blunders in relation to characters\n- Choices have a minimum impact\n- Low standard compared to previous TellTale titles\n- Some sections of dialogue and story felt utterly meaningless\n- Episode 5 was the intro to the DLC. This means that Minecraft Story mode was technically only 4 episodes long and episode 5 was just there to get us to buy the DLC\n\nGameplay - 6/10\nImmersion - 6/10\nGraphics - 6/10\n\nOverall rating - 6/10\n\nP.S. The reason this review is negative is because it does not live up to the usual quality of a TellTale game. I was highly dissapointed in it as it felt like nothing more than a rushed source of income paid out from Microsoft. Perhaps they will fix their mistakes in the DLC. Buy it if you want to but be warned if you are expecting a TellTale game, it's not.","April 3","false","10.8"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","5"

It is hard to come by a negative review which is not based on how "the plot is stupid and has barely anything to do with MC." Seriouslly? I agree that the plot is random, but what else could TellTale do? Minecraft is not a story game! There is no plot in minecraft other than survival (which would make a bad Story Mode) or random building in creative. If Minecraft Story Mode was actually base entirely on the gameplay of Minecraft? That would be boring, would not Tell a Tale at the most part, and geniunly could be done better in the ACTUAL GAME.\n\nAnother "problem" is the mechanics of the game. I have no comment.

This is not true; the base game contains two finished story arcs, and opens the Minecraft universe up for future self-contained story arcs through purchasable DLC.\n\nWhilst the base game in my opinion, in places, is not as good as other games that use the Telltale Tool (game engine), overall it is stellar.

I was so excited for episode 6 but then i found out theres a "Purchase Episode 6" button and i just lost it. I waited 2 months to play that episode only to end up being told that all of a sudden, i need to pay another $15 for only 3 episodes.  How could you use such a sneaky business tactic on your dedicated fans? I will support Telltale games no matter what but i will not support them using this kind of cheap "leech off of fans" tactic that they're using right now, especially if theyre planning on using it for they're upcoming games. I love this game but due to the business approach that they took, i will sadly not recommend this game for new players.","June 2","false","11.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I spak spanish, and you know what? The subtitles wasnt in spanish, insteand they put the HOLE chapter in portuguese...that was crap, horrible, and you wasn´t abble to chance subtitles to english... What kind of game dont let you do that?\nI was really Disappointing, and, there was a promise of episode 5, by this point I just said, okay, its tellatale, a children game will not change my standard that I had them...\nThe episode 5 came out, 2 days ago, the history actually wasnt the big thing, but was interesting again, and you know what?  I was excited because they made a game of 8 episodes instead 5, that was glorious, they just fix them mistakes of what was wrong with this game. The subtitles was on english, but, I can accept english, at least I underteand.\nI came Steam, and now Telltalle died for me, its dead, its so dead than I will never but anyone of them games again, they dont diserve your money, save for yourself.

(for all episodes at about 5,50 eur it is not that bad)\n\nAs a lot here have mentioned it looks more like a quick money grab then a good game. Wolf umong us was better made then this (played the android version)\n\nIf you are new to minecraft then it might even be fun but not for long. The story itself starts off weak.\nAlso for some reason the mouse does not always work then using keyboard to move the char. Just locks for a second (usualy when you need to react fast to point and click.\n\nUpdate:After finishing the game twice there was almost no change to the outcome with the choices i made. I am however hoping that the choices you make will effect the outcome further in the game (episode 3  and up).\nI realy liked wolf umong us and how the choices you took realy effect the game but with this game it looks like the devs have focused on younger people and they dont want to traumatize kids. Like if the butcher would have turned Reuben in to bacon if you would have not done anything ? or the creepers on the bridge would have blown you up if you attacked ? Get eaten by the ender monster if you tried to stay ? etc etc.\n\nI realy hope that the next episode turn the game around or at least the story mode will be a story mode and not a linear one with no consequences to bad choices you make.\nUntil then my opinion on the game will stay as it is.","October 13, 2015","false","12.1"," 25 of 49 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","25","49","0","0"

So when I learned there was a story mode I was excited. I immediately went to the steam store and purchased the game. I launched the game with no prior knowledge of all the issues this game has. Firstly, the game has extremely long cutscenes, that you cannot skip, which is irretating. Secondly, the humor in this game seems to only be satisfying to the younger players, which was not amusing to me. Thirdly, I felt like the storyline was poorly put together almost as if it was thrown together as fast as it could have been so that it could be put on sale as soon as possible. One other issue I had with the game were the camera angles. Again, poor effort Telltale. Another major disappointment I had with this game was on episode four, part one, the game stopped working. The dialogue was not being queued by my movement. After the game stopped working properly I gave up, and just never touched the game again...I wish I saved my money.","March 9","false","5.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dayvis2niverse/recommended/376870/","Dayvis2niverse","DAYVIS2NIVERSE GAMING AND REVIEW","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dayvis2niverse/","32 products in account","OK, I bought this game sometime in March when Episodes 1-4 had been released, and Episode 5 was set for a March 29th release. Now, here is my review.\n\nSTORY\n\nThe game is based off the overwhelmingly popular sandbox game Minecraft created by Mojang in 2009, but I think you've guessed that by now! Minecraft has no pre-made story (you make your own) apart from travelling through a mystical portal to enter a spit of sand in space called the End. Inhabiting the End is a huge Ender Dragon that you have to kill to reach the credits scene. Telltale managed to take the story of this dragon and create a story that spanned over 4 episodes.\n\nMany many years ago, a legendary group called The Order of the Stone journeyed across the Overworld, embarking on amazing quests. The Order was made up of Gabriel the Warrior, Ellegaard the Engineer, Magnus the Rogue and Soren the Architect and the leader. In their final and most famous quest, they ventured into the End and slayed the Ender Dragon. History turned to legend, legend turned to myth, and the members of the Order disappeared into the shadows.\n\nBut one stayed in the spotlight - Gabriel the Warrior. Now, you (Jesse, either male or female) and your friends Axel and Olivia, along with your pet pig Reuben, are off to visit Endercon, where Gabriel is said to be the special guest.\n\nHowever, disaster strikes, and you and your companions must reunite the Order so that they can save the world by destroying the terrifying Wither Storm that threatens their very exsistence...\n\nThe Wither Storm story is set in 4 episodes:\n\nEpisode 1: The Order of the Stone\nEpisode 2: Assembly Required\nEpisode 3: The Last Place You Look\nEpisode 4: A Block and a Hard Place\n\nIn Episode 5, the story stands completely alone, as a sort of demo episode for the Adventure Pass, the DLC that includes Episodes 6-8. It's the same size as the other episodes, but it does feel a little weird because it's seperate from the other arc. In Episode 5: Order Up, the group travels to a strange new land via a magic portal. Order Up is the start of the new story arc (Episodes 5-8). Lots of people seem to be angry about the new DLC, saying that they believed they were buying a full season, not half. They have their season, but from my view Story Mode will never have a Season 2, because it will just keep expanding with new DLC episodes (a new story arc for every addon). If anyone post Episode 8 wants a review of the DLC (which I've already bought) I will be putting that in a seperate review on the store page for the Adventure Pass.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe gameplay is like the many other Telltale games. You'll be choosing from four dialog options, and you'll have a short amount of time to choose how you react. Story Mode is a Point and Click game, where you'll have to solve puzzles. There's also a ton of Quick Time Events, and the decisions that you'll make will affect the story. Some decisions are small, and affect the next chapter, or the rest of the episode, but some span across whole episodes (one choice in Episode 1 creates a determinant character for Episode 2 and 3).\n\nREPLAYABLITY\n\nThe choices you'll make will open up at least 2 different playthroughs, and if you want to choose every dialog option you'll have to do 4 playthroughs. To do Episode 5 in each suit of armour you would need to do 10 playthroughs. It would also take 6 playthroughs to play as all the different versions of Jesse, as there are three male (white skinned, olive skinned, dark skinned) and three female (white skinned, olive skinned, dark skinned). I am about 3/4 through my second playthrough of Story Mode Episodes 1-5 with olive skinned male Jesse and in my next playthrough I'll be playing as the dark skinned female Jesse so I can see how the voice actor for Female Jesse plays the character.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThe graphics are the same as Minecraft, but they are more 3-D. They ran alright on max settings on my ancient computer, apart from in some action sequences. On a good computer, there should be absolutely no worries about lag.\n\nOTHER\n\nI think the PEGI 12 rating for Story Mode is a bit much. It says a few mild swears like c**p, but that is pretty much it. I let my two cousins (they are 7 and 9) play this on my computer where they decided what to say/do as a team. They'd heard it all before, and I'm sure that people about 8+ would be fine to play this.\n\nVERDICT\n\nThis game is very fun, with some good acting, and the episodes are quite long. I think it's a good game to give younger kids a taste of 'Choice Matter' gameplay, as I haven't heard of many games like that for kids. They are missing out!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dayvis2niverse/recommended/376870/","Dayvis2niverse","DAYVIS2NIVERSE GAMING AND REVIEW","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dayvis2niverse/","32 products in account","OK, I bought this game sometime in March when Episodes 1-4 had been released, and Episode 5 was set for a March 29th release. Now, here is my review.\n\nSTORY\n\nThe game is based off the overwhelmingly popular sandbox game Minecraft created by Mojang in 2009, but I think you've guessed that by now! Minecraft has no pre-made story (you make your own) apart from travelling through a mystical portal to enter a spit of sand in space called the End. Inhabiting the End is a huge Ender Dragon that you have to kill to reach the credits scene. Telltale managed to take the story of this dragon and create a story that spanned over 4 episodes.\n\nMany many years ago, a legendary group called The Order of the Stone journeyed across the Overworld, embarking on amazing quests. The Order was made up of Gabriel the Warrior, Ellegaard the Engineer, Magnus the Rogue and Soren the Architect and the leader. In their final and most famous quest, they ventured into the End and slayed the Ender Dragon. History turned to legend, legend turned to myth, and the members of the Order disappeared into the shadows.\n\nBut one stayed in the spotlight - Gabriel the Warrior. Now, you (Jesse, either male or female) and your friends Axel and Olivia, along with your pet pig Reuben, are off to visit Endercon, where Gabriel is said to be the special guest.\n\nHowever, disaster strikes, and you and your companions must reunite the Order so that they can save the world by destroying the terrifying Wither Storm that threatens their very exsistence...\n\nThe Wither Storm story is set in 4 episodes:\n\nEpisode 1: The Order of the Stone\nEpisode 2: Assembly Required\nEpisode 3: The Last Place You Look\nEpisode 4: A Block and a Hard Place\n\nIn Episode 5, the story stands completely alone, as a sort of demo episode for the Adventure Pass, the DLC that includes Episodes 6-8. It's the same size as the other episodes, but it does feel a little weird because it's seperate from the other arc. In Episode 5: Order Up, the group travels to a strange new land via a magic portal. Order Up is the start of the new story arc (Episodes 5-8). Lots of people seem to be angry about the new DLC, saying that they believed they were buying a full season, not half. They have their season, but from my view Story Mode will never have a Season 2, because it will just keep expanding with new DLC episodes (a new story arc for every addon). If anyone post Episode 8 wants a review of the DLC (which I've already bought) I will be putting that in a seperate review on the store page for the Adventure Pass.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe gameplay is like the many other Telltale games. You'll be choosing from four dialog options, and you'll have a short amount of time to choose how you react. Story Mode is a Point and Click game, where you'll have to solve puzzles. There's also a ton of Quick Time Events, and the decisions that you'll make will affect the story. Some decisions are small, and affect the next chapter, or the rest of the episode, but some span across whole episodes (one choice in Episode 1 creates a determinant character for Episode 2 and 3).\n\nREPLAYABLITY\n\nThe choices you'll make will open up at least 2 different playthroughs, and if you want to choose every dialog option you'll have to do 4 playthroughs. To do Episode 5 in each suit of armour you would need to do 10 playthroughs. It would also take 6 playthroughs to play as all the different versions of Jesse, as there are three male (white skinned, olive skinned, dark skinned) and three female (white skinned, olive skinned, dark skinned). I am about 3/4 through my second playthrough of Story Mode Episodes 1-5 with olive skinned male Jesse and in my next playthrough I'll be playing as the dark skinned female Jesse so I can see how the voice actor for Female Jesse plays the character.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThe graphics are the same as Minecraft, but they are more 3-D. They ran alright on max settings on my ancient computer, apart from in some action sequences. On a good computer, there should be absolutely no worries about lag.\n\nOTHER\n\nI think the PEGI 12 rating for Story Mode is a bit much. It says a few mild swears like c**p, but that is pretty much it. I let my two cousins (they are 7 and 9) play this on my computer where they decided what to say/do as a team. They'd heard it all before, and I'm sure that people about 8+ would be fine to play this.\n\nVERDICT\n\nThis game is very fun, with some good acting, and the episodes are quite long. I think it's a good game to give younger kids a taste of 'Choice Matter' gameplay, as I haven't heard of many games like that for kids. They are missing out! It's still good for people that like Telltale or Minecraft too. If you like either Telltale or Minecraft, give this a try!\n\n1) Essential Purchase\n2)Recommended Purchase 3)Recommended during a sale\n4)Not recommended unless heavily discounted\n5)Not recommended even for hardcore Steam gamers","June 2","true","17.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Absolutely fantastic, but it needed character development. The farthest I could tell is that the extras, such as your friends, were lightly characterized and did not play a big part in the story. Secondly, the "they will remember that" is not specific. How are kids supposed to understand if "they will remember that" is a good thing or a bad thing. Make it more specific, for example: "They will remember how horribly you treated them." I think that it is  not worth it for $24.99 if you only get one chapter right now. Buy it once more chapters are released.  As I am a redstoner in Minecraft, I really wanted to do the second chapter and see all of the cool machines I know TTG would make, but I was disappointed when it was just the first chapter.","October 23, 2015","false","4.3"," 70 of 141 people (50%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","50","70","141","10","8"

Not just because it was Minecraft, but because it was going to have a huge audience. Yes, I am a Minecraft player, and yes, there are a few bits of it that bug me when it comes to the Minecraft content, but that's not why I gave it a thumbs down.\n\nI understand first episodes are going to be slow, and work as essentially the tutorial. However, as of this moment it feels like I'm watching a Slamacow animation and not actually playing a game. It feels like a storybook, not a game. Now I haven't played their other Walking Dead game (not my cup of tea, i'll stick to the comics), so maybe this is their style, However the way it was presented in multiple articles on multiple websites was a bit misleading.\n\nTo be honest, I expected a sort of... Life Is Strange feel. Open areas that you can explore with a few little secrets that can be tracked or just be there for fun. Instead it's a webcomic that we're making the speech options for the characters.\n\nIf the coming episodes change this (as I stated prior, maybe this is just the "tutorial" episode to get the plot rolling and you get a hang of the controls), then I'll definitely modify the review to fit it. If not, then my point stands.","October 24, 2015","false","87.1"," 60 of 121 people (50%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","50","60","121","10","2"

It's the moderate/good experience it is either because Telltale tried to add a few good elements but didn't bother to refine them, or because they limitted it with the intent of not overwhelming younger players.\n\nHonestly, you know how Minecraft is about making up your own stories, (almost) failing, and trying to get better at it? That's what this feels like, and so the unimpressiveness is nice because of its familiarity. However, with all the potential Minecraft itself has, it deserves an actually mindblowing, highly interactive, rich and deep experience (which you definitely don't find in this story mode). Hopefully, that too will come along one day.\n\nPros\n+ Lots of Minecraft lore and some humerous critiquing of it\n+ Some interesting builds to explore\n+ Branching story to make your decisions as the player count\n+ You get to choose how to respond to the more unusual of developments\n+ Feels like the Minecraft adventures you might go on with your friends (without the unnecessary delays obviously)\n+ Adequate/good voice acting\n+ Explores various emotional situations although without much depth\n\nCons\n- No open-world stuff; just Interactive cutscenes or small maps to roam around in. Big disappointment.\n- Characters aren't that deep.\n- The lip-syncing - or whatever you might call it - gets annoying.\n- The plot, although not so predictable and free of many loose ends, doesn't get quite thick.\n\n\nVerdict: Give this game a chance, especially if you like Minecraft, but don't expect too much from it.","January 6","true","8.4"," 24 of 49 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","24","49","0","3"

It's not a sequel or even a sandbox. What is has to do with minecraft is its universe and its story telling ability.\n\nI don't know if you are a guy whos strictly done survival, creative, minigames or adventure maps but this game is sort of like an adventure map, maybe with a little less interaction than a sandbox game offers, however, it focuses a lot more on the story. The most interaction takes place in driving the story. Based on the difference in choices, some one else could be playing maybe an entirely different game XD\n\nIf you do get the game, don't expect a mindblowing story with some crazy heavy morals to learn at the end or something. It isn't terrible but i mean, like animated movies you'd go to see in a theatre, everyone should be able to enjoy it, including young children.\n\nSo basically, if your interested in a interactive movie type game taking place in the world of minecraft, i suppose it's worth a shot.\n\nI've never played a telltale game or any game like this before.

Most people who have played this game aren't familiar with Telltale, as they are more known for making mature games. Most people who see this game would think "OOOH! MINECRAFT 2!", but no. This game has almost no relation to the original Minecraft.\n\nIn this game, you play as a character named Jesse, who you can customize (Skin colour, gender). You interact with the environment to collect items, talk to NPCs, and solve puzzles. There are even elements from the original Minecraft, such as crafting and combat. The game follows Telltale's episodic formula, including quick-time events.\n\nMinecraft: Story Mode is a fantastic mixture of a game as creative as Minecraft and Telltale's episodic narritive format. The truth is, the game is not for everyone, if they were expecting the game to be like Minecraft. But if I could recommend any game for people to at least TRY, it's this one. So go ahead, give it a try. I'm sure you'll love it.\n\nI will be reviewing each episode individually. I will try to avoid spoilers, so read on if you want to learn more about the game.\n\nEpisode 1: The Order Of The Stone\nRelease Date: October 13, 2015\n\nMinecraft: Story Mode's debut episode is a joy to play. I remember first picking it up and having the time of my life. This episode is easily the tamest in the series, before the following episodes pick up the intensity. The first episode serves as more of a prologue to the series than anything else, and it truly does not disappoint. The episode is about Jesse and his friends going to EnderCon, an anual event about all things Minecraft, to meet Gabriel the Warrior, one of the four members of the Order Of The Stone. The Order once slew an Ender Dragon, becoming heroes and legends. However, when Jesse and his friends arrive at Endercon, they realize something bigger is going on, and terror and chaos is unleashed, and Jesse and his friends must seek out the Order of the Stone to save the world.\nThe episode is rather charming in terms of its gameplay. I remember finding the humor in the game very entertaining. One part in particular has you crafting a stone sword, but you can be a rebel and instead craft a level, leading your friend to tease you for being a noob. My favourite chapter has to be the EnderCon chapter, because it ramps up the suspense slowly, but builds up the excitement as well.\nAll in all, I'd say Episode 1: The Order Of The Stone was my second favourite. Not just because of the originality and the story or even the characters, but because of just how much it makes me want to replay it, to live through those moments I love. For the first episode, it does a pretty great job of getting me hooked.\n\nEpisode 2: Assembly Required\nRelease Date: October 27, 2015\n\nIt is generally considered that Assembly Required is the weakest episode in the series. It certainly has a good plot line, but the fact that the episode clocks in at only about an hour in legnth is not very impressive. This does not stop my from enjoying the episode, though.\nI wouldn't dare spoil this for you, but the choice that you made at the end of episode one completely affects the story of episode two. You see, Assembly Required branches off into two different stories: one where you go to Boom Town, which is a city full of griefers, and the other where you go to Redstonia, which is a town filled with Redstone Engineers. At the 30-minute mark, though, the two different paths converge and from there the story continues normally. I thought that this was a rather clever idea, and I must say I enjoyed all of the litlle nods to things like griefing and redstoning.\nAssembly Required is short, yet fun. I still believe it is the weakest in the series, but I still enjoy it a lot.\n\nEpisode 3: The Last Place You Look\nRelease Date: November 24, 2015\n\nAt the episode that I consider the climax, things start to become a bit more emotional, intense, and even a bit disturbing in some cases. Episode 3 revovles around Jesse and his friends having to find the last remaining member of the Order of the Stone, who is currently living in the End. If people thought that the first 2 episodes didn't have a good story, I guarantee that you will think that story gets better.\nWhen I said that it starts to get a bit disturbing, I was mostly talking about the Endermen that live in the End. While in regular Minecraft, these creatures are simply there to steal blocks and stand around, Story Mode really made me feel uncomfortable around these guys. There are moments where Endermen loom right in your face. There are moments where an Enderman jumpscares you. Sometimes, Endermen make unsettling sounds and movements. If a younger child is playing Episode 3, they might want to be accompanied by a parent. I can't guarantee that people will NOT find it too scary, but I do think that Episode 3 is the perfect turning point in the series.\n\nEpisode 4: A Block And A Hard Place\nRelease Date: December 22, 2015\n\nWell, well, well. Here we are. Episode 4. I remember back to the advertisment for this episode, where it exclaimed very sharply, "Are YOU ready to take down the Storm?"  Episode 4 is an emotional joyride, and is easily the best in the series so far.\nWhat makes Episode 4 so good, you ask? Well, for starters, it features a lot of character development. Our characters face hopelessness. As Jesse, it is your job to help your friends, and to lead the group. There were many moments where I felt like I WAS Jesse, because the game does that so well. The episode also has a lot of intensity and twists. The first time I played this episode, I had chills almost the whole way through.\nI wouldn't dare spoil the plot, but I will tell you that it revolves around Jesse and his friends going to the Far Lands (Which is a glitch that used to be in Minecraft, being the "edge" of the world) in order to find something that would be their last hope to saving the world. Not only is it intense, but it is very sad. This episode may leave many people crying. I won't tell you why, but just be prepared for it.\nSo, to sum things up, Episode 4 is really good. Not only is it my favourite episode, but I think that it is one of the best things TellTale has ever made. Holding no regrets there.\n\nEpisode 5: Order Up!\nRelease Date: March 29, 2016\n\nThis episode took them a very long time to make, and with good reason. For the most part, they kept the plot, setting and everything about the episode a secret. In fact, the teaser image for the episode used to just be a sign that read "The Next Episode". Now, we finally got to play it, and it surpassed my expectations so much. The episode really does the whole "Minecraft" thing very well.\nSet months after the end of episode 4, Jesse and his friends have become idolized across the land. The episode throws you right in. In fact, it doesn't even give you a recap! It just starts you off with an action packed adventure. I don't consider this to be episode 5 of Season 1, but instead episode 1 of Season 2. It reminds me a lot of the debut episode of the series, where it just left me wondering what would happen. And in terms of plot, this one is probably the best.\nSomething else that is pretty good to notice is that this one is much more interactive than the others. Instead of having a lot of automated things happen on screen, it makes you do a lot more. Telltale games are known for being much more narrative-driven, but I feel that this episode has just enough gameplay that it made me feel incredibly satisfied. For example, there is a segment where you have to make a decision that will take you through two different paths, similar to episode 2, but each path has different styles of interaction. All in all, I think it was a beautiful episode, and I highly recommend it. This concludes my review of Minecraft: Story Mode. I hope it was helpful for you!","November 26, 2015","true","66.1"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","15","31","0","1"

What it is is a game set in a Minecraft world which is like a game version of a Minecraft Novel version of one of those books where you get to decide what happens in the story by answering multiple choice questions. They don't always give you much time to answer and there is some button mashing involved but it is a lot of fun. It isn't some complex story like Agatha Christie novels. Its just a simple but fun story based on episode 1. The episodic nature of the delivery is a bit of a pain but its still fun & I am glad a bought it. My oldest son has really enjoyed it too.","October 15, 2015","true","37.9"," 141 of 285 people (49%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","49","141","285","20","5"
