"http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/recommended/41050/","talgaby","talgaby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/","334 products in account","Short version: 83%Serious Sam can be considered the epitome of old-school FPS games: 100% pure action, non-linear levels filled with secrets, and hundreds upon hundreds of monsters to kill with a vast arsenal. Mindless first-person combat has rarely been this fun.\n\nLong version:When CroTeam, this small Croatian studio released Serious Sam: The First Encounter in 2001, probably even they didn’t think that their game will grow into one of the most successful indie FPS franchises. After all, on the surface, it looks like any other shooter from around 2000: half-linear levels where it is impossible to get lost yet have enough room to hide many secrets, all full of pickups to supply the player with health and ammo for the sizeable arsenal.\n\nThe trick is that this simplicity hides excellent game mechanics. The action rarely stops, but it doesn’t try to tire out the player by not giving enough breathing room. The difficulty levels offer a balanced challenge to FPS newbies and grizzled veterans alike. (Just to illustrate: on ‘Serious’ difficulty, you meet over six thousand enemies during the course of the game.)\nThe range of difficulties is only overshadowed by the available option in the engine itself. The Serious Engines were always famous of letting the player take control, but the first one really takes the top. Thanks to this awesome flexibility, the game ran on anything back then and looks surprisingly good even today, despite its old age.\n\nI’d lie if I said CroTeam put too much effort in the story: you play as Sam Stone, who was sent back to the source of all evil, ancient Egypt, to stop an alien warlord from eradicating humanity in the far future. Still, the writing is quite memorable, thanks to the corny one-liners and the overall nonsensical nature of some of the encounters that help to alleviate the stress after some especially adrenaline-pumping scenario. So, in a sense, the “story” does its job, like the rest of the game.","January 18","true","14.5"," 46 of 53 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","46","53","5","0"

Some say this kind of gameplay is mindless but I beg to differ, at least at the higher difficulty levels you must strategize and prioritize targets asap or your goose gets cooked in a jiff. It can be harsh but once you master the various onslaughs the game throws at you, you won't accept anything less than an avalanche of baddies for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and midnight snacks.\n\nI think the 2nd encounter HD has a more robust tool set than this game as far as options/modes and multiplayer goes but the single player is still very much worth going through if you want to experience frenetic thrills as dozens upon dozens of creatures hell bent on your destruction swarm forth awaiting deliverance from your more than able tools of erradication.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/valiumbatman/recommended/41050/","valiumbatman","COCK FUCK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/valiumbatman/","40 products in account","The greatest FPS made for its time. If not for its outdated graphics, it should receive many trophies for its other up to par features, such as the huge arsenal of weapons made available for die-hard FPS fans who get vexed by the tedium of wielding the same weapon or switching between two different weapons. It's an FPS game that delivers with great humor and an interesting story line that complements the game's aesthetically appeasing graphic designs of ancient Egyptian and Mesopatemian obelisks, pyramids, and statues. The monsters that you fight are so hilarious and unique that you'll begin to feel like you're sucked into a vortex and transfered into a world where everything is strange and creepy. The game evinces the concept of antiquity and alien technology interlaying one another in a historic period (Most likely around 2000BC to 200 BC) in ancient Egypt and Mesopotemia. The feeling of being stuck in an antiquated period fighting formidable technologically advanced robots brews up a unique and interesting game that absorbs you deep into the game. I guarantee that you will not want to stop playing this game after you finish the first level. It's the type of game that elevates your dopamine levels and excites you to the max.

That is not to say that it isn't a game that can stand on it's own though as a solid dose of juvenile shooter action.\n\nThe premise of Serious Sam is simple enough, you are the most badass dude on on earth and you have to kill a bunch of aliens in order to save humanity. The game knows that it's story is not important and makes no effort to hide the fact that the only purpose of the few tidbits of writing you get every once in a while are simply there to make sure you know it's a single player game. What Serious Sam is about however, is the shooting.\n\nMuch like Duke the main character, Sam, is no power armored pansy. He doesn't need cover systems, regenerating health or turrets to kill his way to the alien overlords. The weapons are many and varied although the lack of anything equal to the shrinker makes me a little sad though. The combat is fast and furious your only protection against the multitude of projectiles being thrown at you is your skills at dodging, and of course, you ability to kill stuff so it stops shooting at you. The levels are huge seemingly unending at times and the game throws legions of enemies at you at a time making for some of the most hectic action I've experienced in recent years. Similar to Duke the levels are also littered with secrets and shortcuts that rewards the attentive players among us.\n\nGraphically the game looks good without impressing too much, a good enemy variety and a decent amount of detail in the level design ensures that the graphics only add to the experience. The music is somewhat bland but the sound effects are of a decent quality and Sam's one liners are well delivered.\n\nAll in all Serious Sam The First Encounter gives you a great first person shooter experience the way it's meant to be played, fast, hard and hectic. At a good price point even on release this should be a must own for every serious FPS'er.","June 3, 2013","true","23.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

While it is already old, it is by no means outdated. (With perhaps the exception of the graphics, but hey, that's what happens with any game if more than 10 years pass) Don't mind my lack of gametime on steam - I must have over 100 hours throughout my childhood on this game, it's amazing, and I can recognise it isn't just nostalgia making me say that.\n\nStorywise, it's nothing to write home over. It's a fairly standard story for a game that relies more on its gameplay than on captivating you with word words and more words. Aliens happened, they're after you, you're in acient Egypt and you have guns. Good luck!\nThere is more to it, if you take the time to read into the story there are just enough flavourful blurbs and explanations around that you can read to figure out where your enemies came from, and parts of the storyline, though it isn't something that will carry you through the game, it's more like an extra.\nThe true power of Serious Sam is in the gameplay, with excellent level design, guns that are satisfying to use, and a very high skill ceiling allowing you to feel like a god laying down devastation on hordes of enemies, moving fast enough to dodge almost all of their fire (Since all but a few enemies use projectiles, this means you can dodge nearly everything with enough practice) yet not too fast to become unmanagable. This, along with plentiful secrets, and a game that won't just say 'no' and throw up an invisible wall if you move slighly off the beaten path means that Serious Sam has an excellent grasp the concept of what great games are about- Freedom\n\nFreedom to choose your own tactics (And most are valid as well! No need to gimp yourself)\nFreedom to move as you please\nFreedom to explore the levels and find all the secrets\nAnd the freedom to handle any encounter in the way you want to.\n\nAlong with this, Egypt as pictured is a somewhat unique setting for an FPS game, with a lot of it lending itself for interesting levels and impressive scenery. The enemies you face are unique and mostly iconic as well, with the beheaded bomber and kleer skeleton being some of the more known enemies. In addition, Serious Sam has a great sense of humour, and you can play with a friend, two friends, or a whole army of friends.\n\nIf you're interested in a great FPS game and don't mind slightly outdated graphics, Serious Sam is there for you.\nAnd if you do mind the graphics, check out the HD version!

The game feel is good with Sam moving around. The weapons each have their own advantage against certain enemies. You won't be using the same gun the entire game. I was constantly switching weapons based on what was coming toward me.\n\nThe weapons I would say are pretty "standard". Pistol, shotgun, machine gun, rocket launcher, laser gun, etc. Each having their own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThe amount of unique enemies is fairly small. You'll be seeing the same types of enemies over and over again. The design of them is nice though. Each enemy has a distinct audio clip that you will rely heavily on to quickly choose the right weapon for the job.\n\nI think the graphics hold up quite well. I was able to get the game running in 2560x1440 and it was very sharp.\n\nOne thing that turned me off was the large difficulty spike toward the end of the game. It's a pet peeve of mine when games sharply increase the difficulty at the end. I had to use God mode to get past it.\n\nPros:\n-Good graphics for the time that still hold up today\n-Good gameplay feel and hit detection\n-Audio cues for enemies\n-Each gun has advantages & disadvantages\n-Quick save feature\n-Stable. Never crashed on me (windows 8.1 64bit)\n-Secret areas!\n-Generally smooth 60FPS (has some slowdown here and there but didn't affect much)\n\nCons:\n-Lackluster story\n-Repeating enemies\n-Difficulty spike at the end\n-Felt repetetive toward the end of the game\n\n\nFinal score: 6.5/10\n\n\nI got Serous Sam Classic 1 and 2 by buying Serious Sam Classics: Revolution  for $1.49. Fantastic deal!!!\n\nEven $9.99 full price isn't bad considering you get 2 games with it. If it's on sale and you like fairly average FPS's then pick this up.","November 5, 2014","true","13.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/framerater/recommended/41050/","framerater","FrameRater","http://steamcommunity.com/id/framerater/","225 products in account","One of, if not my favorite game of all time.\n\nSerious Sam TFE displays what an arena shooter can pull off.\nThe storyline? It sets the mood, that's about it, and that's all it really needs to do.\nYou are sent into the past to kill off hundreds upon hundreds to even thousands of enemies from destroying the future. Simple enough?\n\nSerious Sam introduces literally the most memorable foes in any video game I've ever encountered. I remember each name, and all the stats because the game throws them in your face in a way that actually satisfies. Two shots per beheaded soldier, a quick shotgun blast to male Gnaars, double shotgun for those damn Kleers, loaded cannon to the major Biomechs! The best part is that these enemies rarely appear in troops, but in groups! You'll have a Biomech on one side, an Arachnoid on the other, an Aludran Reptilioid on the roof... how will you choose to approach this? It's all up to you and your powerful arsenal!\n\nSomething also notable about Serious Sam is the stunning detail. Each enemy has a spot-on texture to make it feel like a true foe, and writings, paintings on the wall give for a total immersion into the mysterious landscape of Egypt. And how damn satisfying that is.\n\nRunning through factual lands to kill fictional beasts has never, EVER been so pleasing. With a unique arsenal and engaging gameplay, Serious Sam gives you an un-parallelled journey to the beautiful land of Egypt with true to history level design.\n\nI could go on and on, but I can't do this all day. Basically, I find Serious Sam to exceed in almost everything it does, and what it does, just never fails to amaze me in all the probable 1000+ hours I've probably played it in my lifetime.\n\nA closely followed community also backs up this game, giving you awesome access to mods, weapon models, gameplay tweaks, sound edits, and much more to make Serious Sam the game YOU choose it to be.\n\nIt's absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing stunning. 10/10","February 22, 2014","true","25.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I played this as second after SS:TSE and I got it because I wanted MORE Serious Sam. I loved it and along with my friend we've spent a heap load of time on it. Almost as good as SS:TSE but lacks some bits. However for any true fan of Serious Sam this is a must. The battles are just as epic and the co-op is just as good.

The fast paced gameplay and the great choice of weapons make this a really fun game to play, plus places are really interesting and enemies are even more so. One thing to denote is the excellent use of sound, which is really helpful to know what's going on around. Perhaps one of the problems of this game is the excessive endurance segments that can become too repetitive after some time.

I have fond memories of playing this with my dad way back when we first got this house. Now, being able to play it again (courtesy of Mistress Gamer Grill <3) I remember EXACTLY why this game was such a gem. This FPS was the last of a dying breed. Open-level, FPS, no cover system, and approximately three metric buttloads of enemies running at you from all different angles, only to be mowed down by any of your armory of weapons stashed in the black hole behind your back. The enemies in this game are hilarious, the scale of the giant encounters are hilarious, the ridiculous damage of your weapons is hilarious, this game is, and will continue to be the best I've ever played.

Literally. And while that is the beauty of the game (taking account the complexity and the realistic nature of modern day FPS's) it's also it's weak point. It's a lot of fun killing a ♥♥♥♥♥on of alien-enemies with your arsenal, but the problem is that the game has way too many gigantic choke points that are nearly impossible to pass. It can become extremely tedious to go through one segment of a level, and honestly, without the quick-save feature, I would have called it quits pretty soon. Not to mention how often you ran out of ammo and have to resort to using your pistols against really powerful enemies. The game also recycles the same type of enemies constantly, and it can get boring pretty fast. If you aren't familiar with old-school FPS games, don't go for this one.","August 1, 2014","false","4.9"," 14 of 103 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","14","103","0","1"

Serious Sam: The First Encounter blends seamless FPS gameplay, with brilliant level design, and a goofy comedic sense of plotting. Sam Stone is the epitome of much of the late 90's FPS characters and it is with him that I get the most laughs. The enemies vary in some of the most ridiculous fashions. From headless infantry to undead bone predators; Serious Sam brings ridiculous to a whole new level. Nevertheless, it's sense of wit is much appreciated and fresh despite being such an old game. The biggest key here, however, is the design of Ancient Egypt. Breathtaking design and exquisite detail that bring Ancient Egypt to life like I have never seen before. Detailed messages detailing important aspects of Egyptian history, providing comedy and education.

This is not a Duke Nukem 3D or Doom clone, the level design is good but much more linear since the focus here is the shooting itself.\nIts a monster shooter, with balanced guns that feel awesome, great soundtrack and sound design (also helps in combat), good looking for its time (and doesn't look dated unlike other games of its time), lots of replayability thanks to mods, cheats, secrets, higher difficulties or if you just want to try different ways of going through the same levels, plus multiplayer which still has some people playing, but very few since the game is old.\nThe only negative, or at least not positive, thing I can say about this game is that its not much better then the remake. Few secrets changed (no playing with gravity in the remake, but this one barely has it anyway), few secrets added. The game is near perfection, but maybe you'd like to get the HD version instead.","February 17, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tell you what , this game hasn't aged a single day . Most first person shooters do but not Serious Sam .\n\nHear me out . Sure the visuals may feel somewhat repetative after a while but there is always a sense of grandness in the bright open outdoors with the sun shinning over the valley  . The indoors are often well desgined but still feel flat and clumsy sometimes . Their labyrinthian design can feel a bit dated and the gameplay gets very repetative , but its too much fun to be overlooked . Especially in short burts . The First Encounteris also a short game so it won't be a long tiresome journey either .\n\nThe thing that works like a charm , personally is the gameplay . The shooting is a lot of fun . Espcially if you are into games like Killing Floor . You defend yourself while killing hordes of enemies that charge at you from all directions of the map or shoot at you from a high platform or tower . Once you clear an area a door opens and you move into the next area or map . Then rinse and repeat . Occasionally you have to collect a few items or hit a few switches to forward youself into the next map or level .\n\nIts solid fun if you ask me and well worth a try . It might be my nostalgia talking but I am frankly amazed at how good this game feels and runs on today's systems . Everything is butter smooth . No constant updates , no dlcs , no online crap . Just a great single player experience .\n\nTime I deal with The Second Enounter now ! Adios :)","March 27","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you haven't played any serious sam game you should! I have played almost all of them but I gotta say this one just stands out alot more. The newer ones might be more polished and have better graphics but god I love this one.  The second encounter is kinda the same thing just with more levels (like an expainsion pack) so its not much to hate there aswell. Myself if I would be new to the series would probably take a look at Serious Sam 3: BFE or the HD Remakes since they're more polished and newer. But graphics and age isen't everything, atleast not for sam since he is just as awesome in the old ones as the new ones. But be serious and get any serious sam game if you haven't got them all already couse how good they are. (I don't really recommend Serious sam 2 if you think the first and second encounters/3 look good since its a completely different experiense and thing).

Despite its ripe old age of 15, this game amazes me. I have been playing Revolution, and I am playing through both the Encounters, and I must say it's just great. The voice of Sam is so humorous, and the enemies are diverse and fun to fight. I only have 0.4 hours on record because I've been playing the Revolution version. All in all, this game is worth playing, even if it's this old.","February 26","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(I guess it also counts as level design)\n-Kinda makes you wanna come back for more.\n-Almost everything is a trap. Even the +1 HPs thingies.\n-Almost everything Sam says is worth being a famous quote.\n-Very original.\n-Fun shooting and controls are great.\n\nCons:\n-Enemy are outstandingly and unbelievably overused. Specially the bulls, the horses and the robots.\n-The same old formula is used over and over again. Go in a room, get item in the middle, fight many waves of enemies, get to next to room, same thing,.... etc.\n-It has little to no music. But the music in it, specially at the last level of the game, is really nice and catchy.\n-Quite frustrating when fighting certain types of enemies, like huge hords of bulls.\n-When you come back for more, you, probably, get sick of it in less than 2 hours.\n-The areas are too wide, and you're forced to walk too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ much from corner to corner.\n-Almost everything is a trap. Even the +1 HPs thingies.\n-Sam barely says anything, other than a line or two after the end of countless waves of enemies.\n\n\n-So, do I recommend this game?\nIf it were a full priced game, even if it had nowadays graphics, I would not recommend.\nBut because the game is nice, when played from time to time, and holds historical value, and is cheap, I'd recommend.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like the game. It's just that it overuses pretty much everything it has, and gets repetitive quick.\nI'm sure this game will be in your head for pretty much forever. It's a quite original and memorable game.\n\nPersonal review........ 7.5/10..... but it's originality leaves me thinking, so I'd add 0.5 more to that.\n\n8/10. Would play again on different maps or multiplayer (which I still didn't try).","December 24, 2014","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

We laughed while playing just cause of all the quotes. It honestly brings back memories watching him play this. To the people complaining about graphics or stuff like that, this is the original version. Its not an HD remake, it doesn't have anything added in with the HD remake, it's exactly as it was when it came out in 2001 and will always remain to be one of my favorite shooters. The game runs well, looks great for its time, and is just a kickass game you can play if you wanna blow up some giant scorpions with guns with a cannon.
