Smooth bug-free gameplay, vibrant colors and a nice soundtrack. The progression in game complexity is clear and gradual - very relaxing, which I personally seek in a casual game such as this. The only adjustment I had to make was with the cursor. The larger default game cursor was a bit floaty for me, so I switched to a regular cursor in the options section. It was all very intuitive and easy to take care of. Another Greenlight success story for these devs - great job and thank you - your efforts show in the final product.","May 27","true","9.3"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Each round you play has a set of challenges that must be met to advance to the next round. Most of these challanges are things like get a 6 card combo without using any Clubs or get a 8 card  combo without using face cards.    To add to the challange some of the cards will have effects on them that need to be resoulved before you can play them, like find the key to open the locked card or elemanate all the water cards before you can use any of the burning cards.  To help you on the way there are a number of tool you will find and be able to buy.\n\nNice casual game to kill some time and easy achievements too.","May 29","true","18.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I love the whole day of the dead theme, it works very well.\nOne of the biggest pluses this has over other solitaire games is Achievements and Trading Cards, this may seem like something small, but I can stress enough how much this is a deal breaking in buying games to myself and lots of others.\nThe Artwork looks high def and done very well, nice vibrant colors, My only dislike with the artwork is the way the Main guy is drawn, he just seems so very plain, maybe give him a little more style?\nThe music seems to go well with the game too, was not once annoyed by it lol\nThe power ups are a great touch and I can't see myself playing solitaire without them now lol\nI like the way the game progresses, and the fact that it actually has a storyline unlike some games. The game seems a little easier compared to some other solitaire games i\'ve played, like I always seem to get the cards I need before it ends, Ran through the first 10 levels pretty fast, and had a perfect chapter, but none the less, I very much enjoyed this one down to the nitty gritty.\nThe game seems to have a TON of levels, so I assume its going to get harder As I progress.\nI honestly can\'t think of anything bad to say about it other than it should have a regular solitaire mode option as well, and that it can seem to easy sometimes.\nOverall a Great Game.\n\n\nPros:\n+ Achievements\n+ Trading Cards\n+ Not too Difficult\n+ Great Art\n+ Power ups\n+ An Actual Story line\n+ LOTS of Levels\n+ Decent Music\n\nCons:\n- Almost feels a little too easy sometimes?\n- Should have a REGULAR Solitaire mode as well.\n\n\nThis review is a part of Steamified\'s Community Reviews program and the credit goes to Steamified for providing the key for review purposes.\nFor similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.\nYou\'re also welcome to join in the fun in our Steamified group.","May 31","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Forgotten?  Someone remembered.  Enough to tell the tale in this game anyway.\n\nWhat we have here is the higher/lower type of solitaire you'll find in several other games such as Regency Solitaire, Chef Solitaire, Faerie Solitaire, Legends of Solitaire, Goat Solitaire, and FarCry 4.  As always, I want to know one thing.  What does this particular solitaire game do to distinguish itself?  From the other solitaire game I mean.  Not like distinguish itself from the field of presidential candidates or anything.  Having written jokingly about that before, and seeing what we have wound up with as the choice for the next president, I'm not going anywhere near that subject.\n\nConsidering that what we are playing is the same as many times before, Forgotten Tales spices things up with a story about a guy trying to get his wife back from the land of the dead, which really resonates with me because it reminds me of making love to my ex.  What really makes Forgotten Tales stand out for me though are the variety of power-ups and special cards.\n\nThere are several special powers you can use, from revealing hidden cards, to crushing your enemies. Seeing them driven before you. Hearing the lamentations of their women. This is what is best in life.  There are also cards that act as bombs, or rockets destroying everything in their path.  Sometimes it's not so much solitaire as global thermonuclear war.  Shall we play a game?  No fighting though.  Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room! Horror has a face... and you must make a friend of horror. Horror and moral terror are your friends.\n\nOk, that's a lot of movies so getting back to the game at hand, if you like solitaire games, and I know you do, Forgotten Tales will help fill that dark void in your soul that yearns to devour the world.  At least for a little while.  Ia ia Cthulhu fhtagn!","May 29","true","12.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

I had to restart the game to be able to see my achievements.\n\nEnjoying it thus far.","May 29","true","14.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
