"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/recommended/368860/","spiritreviews","Spirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/","732 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOne man's trash is sometimes also trash\n\nFull disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!\n\nGarbage Day is a new indie title with a really cool concept, so dig it: you're a shlub that lives in suburbia, workin' at the nuclear power plant. Everything is great until something goes wrong and you find yourself stuck in a temporal loop, reliving the same day over and over, again and again and again and again.\n\nAd infinitum.\n\nUnless you find a way to break the cycle.\n\nThat's the concept... kind of like Groundhog Day meets Postal. And it's a great idea! But at this stage, for the asking price, Garbage Day leaves a LOT to be desired. You wake up in your bed at the start of the sandbox level and can do a few things. For example, you can: pour a bowl of cereal (though I can't for the life of me add milk), put a tape in your VCR, drive a car (there only appears to be the one), grab a bunch of weapons and go, well, postal (the police will respond but once the four of them are dead there's no real threat), you can kill yourself in sundry ways (thus starting the day over), and you can explore the relatively small sandbox.\n\nAnd that's it, really. There's no single player campaign currently, just the one sandbox level. According to the screenshots there's, like, a snowy environment and a beach one but I only encountered the one suburbia level (Nyarlathotep found a sad, empty beach!). There are maybe a dozen or so townsfolk and cops wandering around (police are denoted by blue shirts and wide brimmed hats, naturally), and once they're dead they're gone for the day. They just meander in the street waiting 'blah, blah, blahing' until you, the player character, give them the sweet release of death. When the shooting (or slashing/cutting) starts they just run in circles, and the cops charge mindlessly – easily picked off with a single shotgun shot from across the map.\n\nOr you could just drive around and slam into them, the AI doesn't really know how to deal with it.\n\nAnd then there are buildings... houses, shops, the plant, a bank – but it's all really desolate. There is a distinct lack of assets, particularly glaring in the offices at the power plant. It feels really hollow.\n\nI just can't recommend it. I'm gonna keep my eye on this and update my review but it currently resembles my bottle of reviewing tequila: empty. There's some great pop culture references, the ragdoll/slow down/physics shenanigans are great, the voxel style is cool, and the general idea is fun, but it's all so much potential and no substance. The mele weapons swing like the crowbar in Half Life and cause ridiculous sparks, the sound of your footsteps is the same regardless of the surface you're walking on, the game resets rather abruptly when the day is up, the AI is as dumb as a bag of  rocks in remedial rock class...\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is Garbage Day is a new indie title with a really cool concept, so dig it: you're a shlub that lives in suburbia, workin' at the nuclear power plant. Everything is great until something goes wrong and you find yourself stuck in a temporal loop, reliving the same day over and over, again and again and again and again.\n\nAd infinitum.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36AQvZAkbNI","January 18","false","0.9"," 156 of 226 people (69%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","69","156","226","45","19"

Therefore I gave it a thumbs up. It only needs more time to develop, granted there is not really much content right now and the price is quite high for what content the game has to offer at the moment.\n\nFirst Sight\nWell well, aren't the graphics just amazing and incredibly beautiful? Well, they really are! And you will be stunned by them in-game. The psychics are really amazing as well, fun to watch things fly by.\n\nGameplay\nThere is nothing much to do at the moment but to play around for ten minutes or so maximum, trying to uncover as quick as possible a way out of the paradox you are in. If you don't manage to, you will reset back from the beginning. And begin your journey. Again. What will you do this time? Murder all innocent people just because? Jump off to your end? Enjoy cereals and watch TV? Do a heist? It's all up to you to decided how you'll spend your time in this sandbox.\nWaiting on the story mode, as it is still in development. I really enjoyed it despite the random crashing. It's fun.\n\nGraphics\nSweetest graphics which will rather make you wonder around and inspect every bit of it and get lost into it!\n\nOST & SFX\nA fitting theme for the gameplay, giving you the right vibes for the play.\n\nPros 'n' Cons\nPros\n\n+The Simpsons reference in the Nuclear Power Plant\n+Sweet psychics\n+Stunning graphics\n+The paradox concept itself\n\nCons\n\n-One setting\n-Price for the available content\n-Short playtime\n-No windowed mode\n-Have to force quit the game in order to change graphics or other options\n\nShould you buy it?\nAt the moment it is quite not the time to get it, wait later on when more content is available. The thumbs up is pretty much because I love the concept and the graphics overall.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:  Follow Original Curator Group","January 25","true","4.3"," 63 of 93 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","63","93","5","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaximoDP/recommended/368860/","MaximoDP","Admiral Auschwitz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaximoDP/","419 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA great concept, but lacking in content\nI've been following this game since the prototype launched forever ago, and I've been extremely excited to finally play the game. When I heard the game was gonna finally be released on Steam in January, I was ecstatic. I kept money aside until release and bought it immediately when it launched. In hindsight, that was probably a silly move, but I'm not wholly dissatisfied.\n\nThe game is great to play. Fun gameplay, unique visual style (for the genre, at least,) pretty cool destruction physics (even if the places in which they actually work are few and far between.) I was having an absolute blast with the game until about half an hour in when I asked myself "Is this really all there is right now?"\n\nI understand that the game is early access, and I probably should've anticipated that, but the lack of content here is kind of inexcusable. The game has a huge amount of potential to expand on itself, and if you're willing to wait for content to be released, it's probably worth getting eventually, but probably not now.\n\nAnother huge problem (which I assume will be resolved as development goes on, but my point still stands) is the performance. Now look, my PC isn't fantastic. I have a GTX 560ti GPU and an AMD A6-3670 quad core CPU. I struggle to run the game at max settings at 60fps. That might sound like some PC first world problems to some people, but considering the actual visual quality of the game, it's baffling that I can't hit 60 at all times. I would've thought at least some of this would be down to the destruction physics, but the game seemingly doesn't take even a slight hit in performance when I destroy anything, so I'm unsure what's really causing this other than a lack of optimisation.\n\nAnother absolutely massive problem with the performance is the abundance of crashes. In my <2 hours of playtime at the time of writing this I've suffered over 10 crashes, usually tied to resetting the level but sometimes just random and inexplicable crashes occur. I hope and assume this will be resolved in the near future because this is a huge issue.\n\nIf you want a game with a justifiable amount of content for the price tag, don't get this right now. $15 is far too much for what is essentially 30 minutes of gameplay at most, and on top of the lack of decent optimisation and abundance of crashes it really brings down the quality of what could be, and probably will be a fantastic game when it's finished.\n\nI would love to recommend this game, I really would, but potential isn't enough for a lot of people to drop $15 on a game. Svajūnas, if you're reading this, I'm really looking forward to what you have in store for this game, but for the love of god bring down the price even just a tad until you've added more content.","January 21","false","2.5"," 52 of 77 people (68%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","68","52","77","6","0"

The idea is to screw around in the world and make your own fun. The question is "are there enough to do for the player to have fun".\n\nIn the current version as of this review (Last update 25 Jan 2015), there isn't enough tools for the player to enjoy. You can pick up 1 of 5 weapons, cause some havoc, and call it a day. There is a slow motion button that you can use. It has no connection to the gameplay but is at least sort of interesting to mess around with. There's 1 car and a few dumb AI controlled NPCs. There's a wilderness area that you can discover, but there's nothing there except the edge of the map. If you walk off said edge, you fall forever. You can easily explore everything the game has to offer in a matter of minutes, and for $15, that's not reasonable.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjzOcyvfcg\nThe game is also clearly incomplete. It does get some leeway for being in Early Access, but having multiple full buildings with nothing inside, and the lack of content overall can not be excused simply because of the Early Access tag. Early Access or not, the game is incredibly incomplete, lacking in content, and even as a sandbox game, needs to have more of a focus to what it's trying to do.\n\nOverall I did not enjoy Garbage Day. Not enough things to keep the player interested, clearly incomplete, and most will find this game boring after only minutes of play. Wait for it to be more developed before sinking any cash into this one.\n\nPros:\n- Decent visual design\n- Slow Motion is fun to play around with\n\nCons:\n- Not enough content\n- Clearly incomplete\n- Can be boring after only a few minutes play\n\n► Garbage Day Video Created on Update: 25 Jan 2015 (last update as of the recording)\n► Hours of Garbage Day played: 2\n► Completion Status on Garbage Day: N/A\n► This copy of Garbage Day provided by the developers","January 31","false","2.0"," 25 of 40 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","25","40","3","3"

It's a fun game, but has some obvious glitches/bugs. For one, a lot of times, if you die, run out of time, or simply press, "O" to reset your current life, it sometimes just crashes. I played it on my mac laptop and pc... it runs really well on a pc, though is REALLY laggy on the mac laptop. A lot of things simply need working on, like the empty rooms in a lot of the buildings. The "Nuke Inc." building is the same floor over and over and over until the player reaches the top. At the top is a glass window primarily with one purpose, to suicide. Another thing... what... about... swimming? I reached the lighthouse in the desert to find it way too hard to navigate through the water to the lighthouse. When I finally reached the lighthouse, I was greeted by a blank white wall with no doors that stood out. No way in to the lighthouse. And now... for the good stuff. This game has a very, VERY interactable enviorment. Poor some cereal, burn it on the stove! Shoot a cop's gun out of his hands! Take someone's head and put it in the woodchipper! Shoot the lock off the bank's vault, and steal the money! With that money go buy some donuts at D's Nuts! Wait... yup. There's the other cool thing about this game. It has countless references and is very humorous. The woodchipper is a reference, the sign that says, "Remember you'll be here forever" is a reference, the tape that the TV plays is a reference! Heck.. the WHOLE game is a reference. "It's GARBAGE DAY!" I think this game will really be great when they add a story mode, and take away the lag for the long lost mac users. Also, the linux users oughta get some fun, though there aren't very many it would be a good addition for them. So let's sum it up, Garbage day has a very interactable map, a large variety of references, and is pretty ridiculous. Anyway that's it! I'm off to get some donuts.

I hope that the story will be soon and will make it worth the $15 price tag. The artwork is good and it has some fun moments, the game should be $7 tops.

The end of the trailer got me really excited for the story mode. It would be nice if when the story mode comes out there would be little side missions.\nFor example, on the refrigerator it says "get milk" so if you would go to the grocery store you would get milk and put it in the refrigerator and get an achievment or something. Also it would be convenient if it would display all the controls when you pause when you pause the game isntead of just looking for them yourself because currently it only displays the main controls.

Definetly not finished, but that's to be expected. One of the first thing's I'd like to see would be to be able to throw the grenade and not only have one. You're able to move the grenade by shooting it and then picking it up but not much else. Also I'd like the car to be able to smash through the walls on the buildings. I know the house you start in is destructable because the grenade can blow it up, and I think it'd be cool to be able to drive the car through some guys wall. Also my final sudgestion would be to make the swords in your neighbors house useable (the neighbor with the animal heads).

Access to games that are being developed with the community's involvement. These are games that evolve as you play and that is fine if you are actually doing something with the game.\nI understand you are doing it solo and that must be tough but i don't care this is the game industry we expect results cause it is a demanding industry.\n\nSince release like months ago not one patch/fix/update or anything.\nHas done nothing but address the sandbox element and explain the story mode to come and since then what?\nNow that excuse is out the way what are you working on in the story?\nWhere are the updates of your progress on the story?\nDo you have a timeframe or goal on this content for us?\nAnimations? Graphics? Buildings? Cool ideas that you may be adding or are working on?\nAnything to show us to keep us happy?\n\nCommunication is key and i see none resulting in me writing this review.\n\nI would not  buy this game in it's current state and suggest the developer show us more passion with his project and get more involved so we can feel and get more involved.\n\nMy Review = 2/10\n\n\n\n","March 30","false","1.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

There are a couple of goals to set for yourself, but then there is nothing else to do thats is interesting. The reason I am recommending it is that this is in really early development.

I highly regret it. All I saw was it was being released on the 19th of January, preorder was available, etc. I thought it looked neat. Annoyingly enough, a very small percentage of what is shown in the video trailer is actually present in the build they send to the players. I would have usually avoided early access and prepurchasing, but I thought the game was done. Stupid me. Can't recommend this game at this current state for $15.

It just needs more 'stuff', more content and things to do. I think once there are more places to explore, more NPCs to interact with, and generally more consequence-less adventures you can go on the better :)\n\n04/04/16 - There have still not been any updates. The last public message left by the developer was two months ago. I have heard from other reviews that he has already moved onto other projects, which is a shame.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/closetyeti/recommended/368860/","closetyeti","Yeti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/closetyeti/","231 products in account","Early Access Review\n\ntl;dr: Very early in development, but the sandbox mode is great fun. It'll be amazing when more is added, but the story mode seems like a one-time thing. Once you beat it, why play it more? Just get it for sandbox, probably. 20 minutes of gameplay link at end of review (with no facecam!).\n\n---\n\nAs you can tell by the average playtime (~60 minutes) there's not a whole lot of game to go off of right now as it's still in development. As such, I'm reviewing not what's currently in-game but what the potential is. Currently, it's just a sandbox to kill an hour with.\n\nThe story mode is not yet implemented, but sounds pretty straight-forward. I fear that once you beat the story once there's no reason to ever go back into it unless there's randomization to the actors, building locations, and a pool of solutions from which one is chosen. Replayability is out the window without sandbox.\n\nThe sandbox mode a terrific fun. First off, the game uses Unreal Engine so the majority of what's being interacted with is physics-based using PhysX. While it's all very simple right now, with some polishing further in development crashing a car through fences and trees has the potential to be different every time. Blowing up a building, destroying a wall, bashing down a door, etc will always good fun and this leads to sandbox being a fantastic thing to jump into and mess around to kill some time.\n\nArtistically, the game's... unique. I don't quite know what it reminds me of, but I get a serious toy-town vibe from it. Everything's so smooth it's like I'm in a plastic world. At first I hated it, but it really started to grow on me. If the bloom stays on its leash it's really quite pretty. Another review had complaints on the game not running well, but personally I had no issues. System resources being used were minimal until I flipped a lightswitch, and only then did the framerate drop. This is a pretty minor complaint, though - this early in development it's a wonder I hit 60fps at all. For that reason I'm leaving out the fact the game crashes fairly consistently after several minutes as that'll no doubt be smoothed out further in development.\n\nThe slow motion is a really neat feature that I think a lot of people are ignoring. I can't put into words how fun it was doing certain maneuvers to kill several cops within seconds during slow-motion, let alone doing donuts with the car. If the physics gets to the point where we can smash a car through the bank and watch the bricks fly, it'll be a fine cinematic experience.\n\n$15 USD might seem a bit high, but at least put the game on the wish list so you don't forget about it. I get the feeling this is one of those games certain YouTubers will pick up and mess around with and folks'll think "Wow, this looks like a lot of fun," and that's because it is!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEOpQSSjbA0","January 20","true","1.8"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

I honestly want to know why the developer thought this game was worth $15, because there are games on NEWGROUNDS with more content and enjoyability than this garbage.\n\nI once ♥♥♥♥ myself in class back in elementary because I thought nobody would notice, I was greatly dissapointed in myself.
