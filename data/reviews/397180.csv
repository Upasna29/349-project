Ok it's heavy on text and light on graphics, but the accuracy of the data and attention to detail are enough to suck you into the game and I find it most satisfying playing a full 24 hour scenario in real time (as long as you have something to do while you wait). The tutorials are easy to follow and fun to play on their own. The only thing I would like to see improved is the inclusion of some kind of graphical or photographic representation of the different ships and planes added to the database. I found myself Googling all of the units on my iPad as I played, just to give my imagination a bit more information to play with. Apart from that, it's a great game and worth every penny.","October 24, 2015","true","20.8"," 38 of 45 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","38","45","4","3"

This game is infinitely closer to the reality of the periods it is set in. The ranges and models of the various machines are excellent and it is obvious a lot of time was spent on getting them correct. A lot of the information in the various fact sheets does not have images or stories and bare facts are a little disappointing. The quantity of items is breathtaking but I would still like to see more images and stories.\n\nThe creators of this version have gone to great lengths to improve the complexity and control. I missed some of the aspects of the old games. The ability to apply air patrols into geometric selections around the ships and airfields and so on made it easier to set up a fleet action. Those patrols were then invisible until they were forced into action which saved some clutter on the screen. The current game has various ways to set up patrols that allow a lot more control but begin to become tedious and adds that clutter I was talking of\n\nIt may be that the years of playing Harpoon spoiled my appreciation of this game but I am finding difficult to get the same enjoyment from it. It is recommended by me for those people who need to get their minds off many hours of life and bury themselves in complex but not always satidfying tasks. It is borderline to being an excellent game. I will perservere and perhaps find what it seems to be missing at the moment","November 1, 2015","true","60.7"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","22","27","3","0"

That's changed with Northern Inferno. The use of a Campaign system - even if it is just a series of scenarios aids immersion, and the 1975 Cold War setting is one I find fascinating. The introductory video is great (I wish every scenario had something similar) and the range of platforms - some common, some more unusual (D43 HMS Matapan anyone?) - maintains interest. If I had one wish it would be that the database descriptions for involved units be expanded a little with some narrative to back up the exhaustive stats (maybe with a few hints on how that particular platform could best be employed) and a somewhat better selection of photographs.\n\nOverall this is highly recommended, either as an introduction to the game or as DLC for more experienced players.","October 26, 2015","true","14.5"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","19","24","3","0"

The mission editor is critical to avoid micro management hell, but documentation is light and logic is less than intuitive (e.g. CAP / AAW behaviours) so the product takes some learning.","December 27, 2015","true","130.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","2"

This is a good entry point to this series but be aware that it is also very limited.  Since this package does not include the mission editor you will not be able to create your own scenarios.  Nor will you be able to play the over 200 community developed scenarios.  You will only be able to play the 15 Northern Inferno scenarios plus the 5 tutorial missions.  This program costs a quarter of the full game and if you are a casuall player this probably will work for you.  But if you want more playability than you should consider buying the full game.","November 4, 2015","true","52.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","11","16","3","0"

The scenarios are as realistic as one would imagine, and the cut-videos of 70's tacky reporting add that little bit of flavour and realism. It's a shame the core game didn't ship with Northern Inferno, instead of relying on community support almost from the start, but, that said, the future of CMANO should be in providing more campaigns like NI.\n\nRecommended.","December 5, 2015","true","10.9"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","12","18","3","2"

I really like the game but in todays market it just doesnt seem right to pay 20 bucks for a campaign, which is all you get here. You can play any part of the campaign which is nice, but weapons miss/failure rate is depressing. This game also comes with a bunch of scenerios but you cant play them without dropping an extra $90 on it. So dont waste your $20. Pay the $90 for command modern air if you are thinking about trying this game. Just keep in mind there is no graphics - which doesnt bother me, i like strategic games. I wont pay the $90, that is way too much for a game with no graphics. If i had to do it over again, i wouldnt pay more than $7 for it, and i wont pay more than $25 for the real game.","April 18","false","64.2"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","14","28","0","11"

Many game functions and commands are compatible with Harpoon3. H3 veterans will easily grasp the basic game concepts and controls and be playing within an hour.\n2. A physics package will ensure that most units will observe the Laws of Physics.  This means no more instantaneous acceleration, turns, dives, or missiles fired 'over-the-shoulder' at a pursuer.  Unfortunately, the game engine only applies the universal Laws of Physics in specific situations.\n3. Sensors and weapons report very detailed resolution through comprehensive messages that show the various modifiers and variables. These messages can be disabled if they turn out to be too much information.\n4. Third-party modifications to images, sounds, and icons are easy to add.  Many images for the aircraft, ships, and submarines have already been added by the user community as well as a speech and ambient sound module.\n5. Color-coded messages make for ease of reference by the player.  Hostile action reports appear in Red, while other administrative reports appear in white, green, or yellow.  The colours quickly catch the player's eye and help him categorize those reports that require immediate attention.\n\nThe Bad\n\n6. No multiple player capability exists.  The only opponent is the AI, which can be easily tricked once it is understood.  This is easily seen from the video AAR for a scenario classified by the developers as Maximum Difficulty and Complexity:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=545102292\n7. The Event Engine produces strange results from teleportation of units instead of the more recognized deployment from aircraft or ships.\n8. A crude Formation Editor capability means that the solitary map is cluttered with unnecessary icons and symbols.  Confusion quickly ensues when aircraft assigned to protect the carrier group cannot easily be distinguished from those assigned to expeditionary missions.  Most other games have independent window displays to control formations so that units can function as organized groups.\n\nThe downright Ugly\n\n09. No database editing capability exists.  The database is frozen.  The current items, equipment, and systems can be shuffled, re-arranged, or re-combined, but nothing new can be added nor can the performance of any current system be modified.  Players are forced to accept false perceptions of reality.\n10. The false database information cripples virtually all modern combat aircraft with the same 925 knot maximum speed on afterburner, regardless of their true performance parameters in Real Life.\n11. The UI is severely overloaded, cluttered, and user-unfriendly.  The dependence upon a single map to display all the units and functions means that the number of icons and other data displayed is extreme.  Coupled with the inability to turn off some information, this means that the player is easily overwhelmed by the data, much of which he probably did not want to see in the first place.\n12. Direct player control is difficult to exercise due primarily to the single map display.  The inability to differentiate between units at a distance or high altitude means that the user must constantly zoom in and out to locate units for his orders and targets.  This awkwardness triples the time and effort necessary for the most simple and basic orders and truly makes the game a chore to play instead of a pleasure.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nThis game remains absolutely painful to play and is tedious to the extreme.  The player finds himself fighting through the interface more than the AI opponent.  This is exemplified by the recent video AAR:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=545102292\n\nA scenario that would normally take no more than an hour to play in other games like Harpoon, Fleet Command, or Naval War Arctic Circle, drags out to nearly 5 hours in MNO due to the awkward and cumbersome user interface and inability of the game engine to process time compression.  This scenario was nearly run in 1:1 real time because the game could go no faster, regardless of the time compression setting.  This scenario was run on an quad-core Intell7 processor 4gB RAM.\n\nThe scenarios included with Northern Inferno are of poor quality, as many bugs have immediately been reported upon its release.  The 15 scenarios of NI are of the same mediocre quality as the official scenarios from the basic MNO game.\n","October 30, 2015","false","6.1"," 20 of 43 people (47%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","47","20","43","5","7"

After playing extensivly I and enjoying it I feel an update is required. The biggest factor for me is the price. The full game at almost £70 is a joke but this is C:NI somewhat cheaper and I got it on sale.\nThe missions for NI are great, they are well scripted and require thought and planning to succeed. For this alone the pice I paid was worth it. Replayability is limited because of the games lack of AI. The missions attempt to funnel you into specific directions where the limited AI be set up. Going around often turns a finley balenced situation into an easy win. The problem is once you have played a mission you know what the designer expects you to do.\nThe fiddlyness of the controls is something you get used to and the poor resolution of the map at close in zooms is ugly but not a deal breaker. The poor AI on both sides is something that is greatly mittigated by manualy controling every asset. This however leads to the absolute worst fault the game has to offer. Manualy controling a large fleet with a huge air wing is a grind but if you dont the following will happen;\n\n-Aircraft will decide to return to bace or refule in air when extreamly close to intercepting dangerouse incomming enemy despite the refueling aircraft being extreamly far away.\n-Aircraft will follow enemy back to thire airfield and promptly get shot down by SAM, if you set them to stick to a patrol area they will ignore enemy that are very close just outside of the patrol area.\n-Aircraft will run out of fuel as the AI cant always figure out when to return to a home ship that has changed course or speed.\n-Support aircraft dont attempt to run from incomming enemy.\n\nDespite this and many more issues I do like this game and want to love it. I can recomend NI especial on sale but the devs have got alot to do before I or anyone elce should think about the full game. It is essential that certain design decisions be reverced to make this more moddable. Cos if the devs can't/won't fix a thing the community might.","May 15","true","64.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
