The music is fine, I don't particularly like the art style, but I can respect it enough to get over it. My suggestion is that if you're interested enough to be reading reviews, you might as well just give it a go. It's free to download, and it's a fairly short one at that. It'll be pretty quick to see for yourself why it's so bad, but here's my experience anyway.\n\nAs far as game play, you drag and drop troops in lanes, and they automatically act at the end of your turn. There is some strategy, but it's not particularly deep. There are unit types, but you'll want to stick with your best units regardless of composition or tactics. It says "Tactical RPG" and the tactics are limited, but the RPG part even more so. It's a moot point, but I don't consider it "Role playing" when you're just following a set story that you have no input or control over.\n\nThere isn't much for character customization, you pick from a handful of avatars, and obviously a name, and that's about it. There are a few skills where you can select one from, and swap it out at any time.\n\nThe game itself is unoriginal, I've played thousands like it. It's a little better produced, but it's on par with the old flash games of the newgrounds era.\n\nThe game is plagued by pay walls. There is an energy system, so you can only play a few battles every few hours, or pay to regain your energy. It's the worst kind of pay wall. They also sell units in the item shop, and just about anything you could want.\n\nNormally I'd let it go, and not bother writing a review. A game so typical isn't worth it. Being free, you should know what you're getting into. Being a short download, what have you really lost? I don't expect younger folks to understand, but Square/Enix put their name on this. Square and Enix both had such an impact on my childhood, especially in the SNES era. To see the two merge, and be reduced to putting out bland, unoriginal mobile games is disheartening.","May 23","false","1.4"," 261 of 281 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","261","281","4","14"

Over a month ago i quit playing this game, because of the reasons i'll explain.\n\nHeavenstrike Rivals is Tactical Card Game. It's all about PVP and co-op raids(again for PVP, because you do raids to get unit rewards) You have 15 unit squad and draw from you squad, and when it's your turn, you drop a unit according to your mana. There is a good tutorial in-game.\n\nLet's start with good things;\n\n-Art design. You'll love unit designs and want lots of units really bad. Because they are cool, cute, super, whatever you want.\n\n-Tactical depth "potential". There are over 700 units and so much combos and combinations you can do, and possibilities to do crazy moves. Every bit of thinking while building a squad pays off in arenas or leagues. But this potential is wasted because of OP or bugged units.\n\nNow with the bad things(a.k.a why i quit);\n\n-Gacha system. This game is Pay to win. "200$ for a unit". Cores are everything in this game and outrageously expensive. They are used for pulls with a chance to drop some units advertised in that specific drive. It's like lottery.\nLike, to get a one unit you want(and you need 4 of the same unit for them to be max rank) you have to spend like 200$ or more. But even then you may not get the unit you want. You get 2 or 3 free cores every day with simple missions. Story missions give cores for the first time you complete them, but that's it. If you only use these, you need 8 months to get only 1 legendary unit you want. That's the probability according to % MediaTonic claims.\n\nFor Steam release, arena and league format were changed to give more free cores to people. But it is still low. You have to get into top 50 in these tournaments,and believe me, if you don't spend at least 500$ after starting this game, there is no way you can be competitive in tournaments. If you don't have that much money to pay, you have to wait a year to be slightly competitive.\n\n-No support. Tons of bugs. There is absolutely no support for this game. There is a support but they answer your problems with "we're working on it...". There are tons of game-breaking bugs since i started playing, and most of them are acknowledged by MediaTonic, but not solved for a year. If you want to play this game, you need to accept the game with the bugs you encountered. They were not solved for a year, and i don't see a reason why they will be solved after now. That's why i never understood the people paying thousands of dollars for this game.\n\n-No balance. You'll see same opening and same combos so many times, and fail to counter them if you don't have specific units. Because people love to use bugged and OP units. And MediaTonic loves to come up with new OP units every week. There are some units that require no thinking, like destroying all your units every turn. Real audience is people with $$ and meaning of balance is countering OP units with releasing more OP units which only people with $$ would be able to get.\n\n-Addiction. You'll be addicted. It's like smoking, really.\n\n-Frustration and Disappointment. If you can withstand all of these negative things and continue to play paying no money and being somewhat competitive, you'll lose matches because of game crashes, you'll pull from gachas with your 4 months saved cores and get only weak units, which you can get from easy missions. There are over 700 units, sure, but saving cores for 4 months and getting nothing is bad. You will be disappointed, frustrated. It's like you wait for something to happen for months and work for it, but you get nothing. And again, and again and again...\n\nThere are lots of points about game that can be discussed but these are the major things.\n\nTo sum it up, i can't even slightly recommend this game to anyone.","May 23","false","0.2"," 111 of 123 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","111","123","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Quixotic134/recommended/441020/","Quixotic134","Serenity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Quixotic134/","145 products in account","TL;DR:\n\nDon't let the 0.2 hours played fool you, I have been playing since April 2015 on iOS, have spent over $600 (though most of that was in the beginning before I realized my mistake), and I can honestly say don't bother unless you enjoy throwing away your money.  There is a right way and a wrong way of making money off players, and HSR employs the wrong way.\n\nDevs are not interested in maintaining game balance (or they don't know how) or fixing game-breaking bugs, both of which undermine the return for your investment.\n\nPlease note that this is not a thumbs down because the game is Pay To Win.  Developers need to make money somehow.  The issue is the current model is not a long-term model designed for growth and sustainability.  The model is designed to milk players of as much money as possible before the players wise up (read: burn out) and leave.  I still play simply because I'm a completionist and don't want to miss out on any new, free units, but the game has long ceased to be fun.  Out of good conscience, I would not recommend this game to my friends.\n\n------ EXTENDED REVIEW -------\n\nDon't bother, or at least don't bother spending real money on the game.\n\nHeavenstrike Rivals presents the illusion of substance (catchy art style, SE branding) when you're starting, but after you've spent $$$, you'll come to realize the following:\n\n1) $100 gets you very little in this game compared to, say, Hearthstone. You don't realize the full extent of this when you start, but most of the units you obtain randomly through the store are either utter trash and/or free to begin with ("Rare" is actually common, "Super Rare" is actually just rare, etc.). And because the game does not have a recycling system, nor is there any actual use for the gold currency (there is a gold gap, and most existing players have hit it), you'll find yourself eventually selling at least 80% of obtained units for nothing, just to clear inventory space.  New players will not realize this because they will still be busy training units up to level cap, but trust me on this, both gold and experience become all too easy to obtain, so the only value provided to you by new units is their ability to rank up a unit skill.\n\nThanks to the newly implemented guaranteed legendary every 20 units, you'll occasionally get one rank of something useful (though with the large number of legendaries, good luck with that), and the remaining 15% (Super Rares) will cease to be useful when you've accumulated enough units. You'll either trash those as well, or hold onto them (costing you cores for more inventory space) hoping for a recycling system in the future. $50+ for 95% waste product and one rank of a maybe useful, maybe useless legendary, where you'd often need 4 of the same Legendary for it to be truly viable -- think on that.\n\nThis is not to say you absolutely need to spend $$$ to have a chance in PvP (though it helps).  I play a shortbus deck consisting of the same 3 units, and I win at a 70% rate.  However, if the entirety of the game is to simply play the same 3-unit opening sequence, why bother?\n\n\n2) The game developers have demonstrated laughable incompetence at developing balanced skills that promote game longevity and credibility. Some would argue that the power creep is intentional to promote new sales, but then they release some really awful legendaries (though perhaps that, too, is an attempt to promote new sales as it further dilutes the value you receive from spending money).\n\nWhatever you choose to believe, expect that any unit you spend $$$ in obtaining and maxing will be completely obsoleted by the next new thing. While this is common to all card collecting games (why else would you spend more money, correct?), the loss of value is drastic compared to other games. When the cost of maxing a single legendary can be in the hundreds to $1000+ USD if you're unlucky, and there is no trade market to recoup any part of your investment, Heavenstrike Rivals simply does not feel like a healthy franchise in it for the long haul, but a cheap mobile game interested in short-term cash grabs.  Take the just released Edward Ulric unit for example; while not OP, the original unit skill had viability, but due to lagging sales on the FMA drive, they released a same-day "balance" change, making the drive more attractive.\n\nThis is the issue with the current pricing model.  As you can easily spend $200+ on the drive and not pull a single instance of the desired legendary (when a drive has more than one legendary, there is usually a more rare and less rare legendary), nobody is willing to spend money unless the new unit is OP compared to the existing unit base.  At the same time, when your expenditure is in the hundreds to thousands, that same philosophy makes the game that much less appealing.  Balance changes are always made in the interest of furthering sales, and not in the interest of creating a credible, long-term e-sport platform.\n\n\n3) Another reason this game cannot be taken seriously enough to spend real money is the lackadaisical bugfixing. Every game has bugs, but any credible e-sport platform attempts to eliminate any issues that may undermine the credibility of competitive matches. Many game-changing bugs have been around for so long that they've simply been unofficially acknowledged as part of that unit's strength (or weakness). Then there are the completely random bugs, where units switch lanes, completely disappear, become invincible, inflict the wrong amount of damage, etc., and the list goes on.  This is only acceptable if your investment is minimal.\n\nFor over a year now, in PvP, you can intentionally close the game to avoid picking up a PvP loss (it used to be that when you did this, you'd also crash your opponent's game, denying them the win as well, though this appears to be less frequent now).  What's more amusing is that for a time, they actually thought it would be a good idea to release a PvP ranking based on Win Loss ratio, until the community pointed out that Win Loss records meant nothing.  To be fair, there is supposed to be a fix for this coming out soon, but to date, every fix has come with negative ramifications, such as punishing players for legitimate crashes/bugs, which are frequent.  Just this past Arena, I was kicked out of the match due to "Game expired" even though it had only been my turn for 5 seconds.\n\nIn PvE,  game crashes are so common that they changed the PvE system so that your energy is consumed upon completion of the mission, instead of upon commencement.  This was a pretty significant change to deal with a problem, because while it ensured that players only wasted time, it also allowed for major abuse.  Raid crashes are not so fortunate, as energy is depleted the moment you start the match-making process.  I'd say over the long run, my game crashes 10% of the time when initiating match-making, 10% of the time immediately after winning a match but right before you receive your rewards, and 2% during a turn in a match.  There are periods of time where I have no issues for weeks, and then suddenly a week where 50% of my matches end up crashing one way or another.  My other apps are crash-free.\n\n---\n\nThe bottom line is the game remains fun only when you invest very little. After you've invested enough, all the flaws (and lack of value) in the game make you wish you could get back what you invested. Save your $ for a new video game/board game, buy something nice for your significant other, or, hell, splurge on that expensive dinner you never felt you could afford. You'll feel better for it.\n\nIf you do spend on cores, I advise playing the game for free for at least 6 months to get a better feel for what units you should be spending your hard-earned money on.  Playing for free for 6 months will also allow you to experience the crappy return rate for a sufficiently long period to provide for a more informed decision.","May 25","false","27.9"," 45 of 52 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","45","52","7","5"

Ok so i'm a huge fan of final fantasy i will admit i downloaded this game just because it was owned by square. i was stoked and despite being a mobile game was not put off.\n\ni rarely do reviews but have got to write this as a detailed view of what to expect.\n\ni start up tutorial is easy enough gameplay is almost exactly the same as other games i have seen with 3 rows of tiles you spawn units with "cards" and you try and kill the guy at the end the hero unit.\n\nit has no tile building tactics akin to ninja cats v samurai dogs however one mechanic i do praise is that the sqaure next to your hero is a home zone so people cannot block the spawn zones with mobs like other games.\n\nwith passable mechanics and graphics i move onto characters and dialoge and quest chat etc etc and this is all completely horrible and. i cannot put into words how strongly i feel no characters are likeable. the writing is ♥♥♥♥ poor and the tutorial cardboard cut out teacher is so condasending to the other cast i literally lasted about 3 missions before i skipped all dialoge plain to how bad it was and i never do that i read text in every text game.\n\nthis is the worst character dialoge and most hated characters sqaure has ever made squall is 100x more likeable than anyone in this game.\n\ncurrentcy is actually quite a blast. at 5 gems per mission rewarded and 45 for 10 premium characters i was gobstruck at how i got a legendary character with my starting gems and 2 super rare.  also for you grinders out there 20 gems can buy you as of this review 8 million in game gold so you can basically upgrade people to crazy high levels as long as you have the sacrifical lambs.\n\ni praise this game on it's ability to make free players have nice things.\n\n.... now allow me to render everything i said completely wrong in my own sentance.\ni went into pvp at the lowest rank the lowest level thinking yeah ok i have a team and combo i am happy with i have a nice little starter nooby deck with legendaries at levels double my main due to this stupid gold influx for no money spent.\n\nit was magic the gathering all over again. the cards  ithought were good got completely and utterly destroyed. you make a team of i think 10 guys you have really very few characters to add to a deck. i sit there at lowest rank against decks which buffed every card 2/2 a turn and gave them all armour making them invincible. my legendary 6 damage a turn mob was rendered to 0 damage fodder as a deck built by someone with months worth of game exp and a specially crafted deck tore me to shreds time and time again.\n\nthe stamina system is bad you get very little stamina you will be waiting days to do anything as with about 40 max stamina mission 9 of the story counting tutorial cost 9 energy.\n\nplay this game and you will hate the story and skip the dialoge and hate every character in the game npc wise.\n\nif you play say 3-4 missions every energy cycle and deal with the dialoge be aware that pvp is pretty much blocked as far as i'm concerned until you have a deck that would make a seasoned magic the gathering pro cry.\n\nin my mind a game which counts on it's pvp system to give people satisfaction needs to have entry level matchmaking and ease people into the games.\nultimately though my thumbs down is because the campaign and energy are not upto snuff. the main part of the game you wil be grinding is painful and the process to getting into the game's late game pvp aspect is frankly rediculous.\n\ni will praise only it's lack of total greed with a fair gem system which may offer some form of help but this game is for the hardest core of deck builders and not your mass market.","May 23","false","1.8"," 59 of 80 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","59","80","4","0"

It tries to be like Blizzard's Hearthstone, and it's getting there, but it lacks the free-to-play tools necessary to appeal to a wide audience like Hearthstone - no crafting system and few ways to earn freemium cash to regularly obtain new units. It has the potential to be a great game if it wasn't barred by typical mobile app money-grubbing tactics.\n\nI recommend for beginners to repeatedly roll the x10 unit recruitment drive with the starter cores until you obtain an adequate squad. Reset or create a new account for more starter cores and repeat until satisfied, then begin playing. Your starting squad and legendaries are extremely important for the future.

At least I want to warn some friends I really care about on Steam to STAY AWAY from its corrupted devil heart.\n\nHeavenstrike Rivals is a board/chess/card type of game that has an interesting battle system, some good RPG elements,  popular cards/statues (whatever it is called) collecting system, variety tasks you can do in the game to keep you busy for a while (story, leveling, PVP etc.) However, this game isn't fun, it is pretty much a failure, like most of the mobile games ported to PC.\n\nThe main issue here is this game is a "PAY TO WIN", and the cross platform PVP system basically ruined the League, the worst part is: the match making is broken. I'd like to repeat myself, it is a pay to win, you can be a god in the league if you have spent enough $$ in it. Also here are extra tips below.\n\nAt the start, the game seems to give you a lot of resources, and through your avatar's leveling, you gain some as well. But it is far not enough to get a decent deck if you are willing to join the league to do some PVPs and earn some shields for the rewards. Well, all I can say here in a polite way is: Beaten AI up is not very fun when playing for long. And everything you need to purchase has been transformed into the game currency which is the core you need.\n\nEven the fact that I only did a few PVPs before I completely gave up because I had opponent who has overwhelmingly powerful decks that make my eyes go funny, I can barely had any ideas of how can he/she got that many great cards/statues without empty his/her wallet.\n\nThe reason lies beside: I am in Act I stage 20, (it maybe a early stage in the story mode), but I can't see any cards he/she has can be rewarded from victories from the past stages(there's not a single cards I can see as normal appearance in his/her drive)\n\nThe game gives around 90 crystals for free at where I am, you can use them to purchase around 20 random cards include some legendary cards, well, if you are that kind of lucky. But I don't think it can make a powerful drive like I've seen from my opponent. And he/she owns several those sort of things in order to achieve a total victory, which means I am beaten. And it is just one example of my PVP opponent, and he is not even rare in the league. The funny part is, the game basically stop giving you free cores after certain stages. Going PVP is the only way to gain a decent amount of cores in a short time, but all is for not spending real $$ in the game. However, by not paying, you have no real chance to win a match, well, usually. @_@\n\nIf this wasn't convinced you it is PTW game,okay. What about this: the fact is this game uses limit amount of energy to make you progress and how long you can continuously playing. The further you go, the more energy it will be consumed. It regenerates 1 point after every 2 mintues or so, which means you can't farm 24 hours a day and 7 days a week to gain more cores to purchase more cards, it is just not possible within this terribly designed system. BUT! It is NOT a new game, it has been released on mobile about 2 years thanks to some players acknowledge it to me in the forum.\n\nOkay, now you can tell me, without $$$$s, where these PVP players come from? Hackers? Surely no. It is Square Enix, not FromSoftware, remember?\n\nGenerally the PVPs in Heavenstrike Rivals is not friendly to all newbies. My personal idea of this is: It has done wrongly. Simply because SE, you can't just port a card/board mobile game that has been released for so long directly onto steam, it just won't work! It is only suitable for singleplayer games that nothing will really change that much after years like your FF series or some good MOBA games that paying is rather not important than actual skills it requires to win a match.\n\nHowever, for a board/chess game, obviously, the more time and MONEY you've spent will terribly grant you power and ranks, it is no more than a joke to lure steamers to jump into this trap. Some of us might be rich, but none of us are idiots.\n\nWhat's more? Well, I have played quite a fair amount of "Free-to-play" games both on steam and outside of the steam, a real good ftp games, in my opinion, does need to have fantastic game mechanics to attract gamers, but more importantly, with a fair price to make the marjor players can support it with ease. Heavenstrike Rivals made the wrong move which is not clever, that is also why I don't recommend it.\n\nExample is here: HR, you should sell 10 random 3 stars cards/statues with 4.99$, not 9 core that I couldn't think of a reason to purchase. What the f**k that for btw? I guess a purely donate to the developers I say to you. 30$ for the enough core to buy a 10 random cards drive with a mix of 3-5 star cards? No, thank you, I'd rather delete your game and stay away from you.\n\nMost fantastic ftp mobile games are hellly money grabbing stuff, especially card/board games. So does Heavenstrike Rivals. Stay away from it, save your wallet for a one-off purchase title that keeps you entertaining for long.\n\nScarlet's Score: 6.2/10\n\nP.S The game serve is very buggy and slow, it constantly crushes specially when its busy. Basically unplayed at night for me, reading lost connection is a big part of my life in this game, sometimes ended up with 'your games has been expired...', error codes etc. But the result is the same by the way: you lose your match along with the energy you've spent for it. Can't recommend it.","May 30","false","117.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

It does nothing wrong in the gameplay department, the characters remind me of the artwork from Final Fantasy Tactics, and the leveling/promotion mechanics make it fun to grind your newly earned units, and watch them become more powerful.\n\nSo why am I giving it a thumbs down?\n\nBecause despite this game being enjoyable for the most part, there is one glaring flaw for anyone who wants to enjoy some fair, competitive PvP: the PvP. This game is either cross-platform with the mobile version, or there are some people dropping insane amounts of cash. I started the day this game released on Steam, and have played it quite a bit. Yet in PvP I lose most of my fights to people with lots of 6-star (the best I've seen so far) units that are also twice the level of my units.\n\nLogically, the most likely situation is that I'm playing against a bunch of mobile players who have been invested much longer than I have been (this game released in Nov 2014 on mobile). I suppose it's also possible that people are paying to upgrade quicker, but either way it makes the game less fun for those of us who don't want to dump lots of cash to catch up or keep up with those players.\n\nAlso, the servers aren't that populated. In a PvP season that just started today, I have a record of 0 wins, 2 losses, and I am still somehow ranked 62 with 0 points. To put this in perspective, the top 100 people to rank automatically win rewards. I have finished a prior season, which typically lasts 3 days, with less than 10 points and still took 150-ish overall (and I believe a win is worth 2 points).\n\nOverall, the game is fun as a singleplayer/PvE game. But the PvP is often lopsided, and no amount of strategy will make a difference in the outcome of the battle. Seeing as PvP is the game's major draw, I have to consider this fairly heavily against the PvE elements of the game, which are mostly for wasting your energy and making you grind for units and items to level and promote them. The PvE is there only to complement the PvP, but the PvP is just a well-designed paywall.","May 30","false","28.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The gameplay can be confusing at first, but over time you might get used to it. Think of it like the game Chess, each piece has it's own different movement. Instead of movement (in most cases,) it's their abilities in battle. Otherwise, the gameplay is a mix of Yu-Gi-Oh and Chess. The plot is rather repetitive, each time you enter a new area you'll have to fight your way through it, which can be annoying to most. I wouldn't highly recommend playing PvP too much because novice players would most likely get their butt handed to the other player. I know most reviews have mentioned this game is Pay-To-Win, but is it really that full of it? To be honest, no. The reason why I say no is simply because the in-game purchases are optional. They are not required to beat the game's story mode, nor playing PvP to get the highest "Rank." Now, my final thoughts on this game is to simply say this: I'm recommending this game simply because it's something different to have on Steam. If you are a fan of strategy games, this game is definitly worth trying out. If you have this game on your iOS/Android device, you can sync it to your Steam account and the other way around.","May 24","true","3.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Hopefully I'll be able to do so by breaking the game down into parts. See further down for my reasoning. If you're wondering about my playtime, I'm level 58 on the phone and gotten over 13 win streak in pvp. I've played for months.\n\nScores:\n- Gameplay:     7/10\n- Singleplayer: 6/10\n- Co-Op:           8/10\n- PvP:                9/10\n- Lategame:     6/10\n- Devs:             9/10\n- Port:              4/10\nIn total I'll give it a 6/10. If they'd made the port better, I'd no doubt rated it higher. Hopefully, I'll get to change this review sooner rather than later.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay of Heavenstrike Rivals is interesting. On the phone, it's marketed as a TCG (Trading Card Game). In reality, there's no trading. And there's no cards. The new tag they're using on Steam fits the game better.\n\nThe game pits two 'commanders' against each other, be it single- or multiplayer. The objective is to get past the enemies minions and reduce the commanders health to zero. There are many different approaches to doing this and it depends on what kind of a squad you're using, as well as if you're PvE'ing, PvP'ing, Raiding etc.\n\nSingleplayer\nThe singleplayer campaign revolves around a team of fighters on a mission. The each quest pits you against different minions on different maps. While it might not be the most fun, if you're a fan of tactical thinking, you might have a pretty good time on your first playthrough. The story is cliché tho so if you're picky there, stay away!\n\nMultiplayer Co-Op\nOccasionally the developers will release a temporary raid. These pits the player and another against an enemy of way higher difficulty than usually. Each player takes turns playing on the 'player' side of the board, meaning you'll get to play 25% of the time. Raids are fun, different and interesting.\n\nThe only real downside is that most other players don't know how to play and just trade minions until they lose. It's basically just about replaying a raid until you get a competent player and then win.\n\nMultiplayer PvP\nThe gem of HS: Rivals. Since minions differ greatly in strength, players who spend a lot of money will generally perform better than someone new. Still, as you'll get quite a few minion recruits just playing the story and doing daily quests, if you spend them wisely, you'll most likely end up with an alright deck.\n\nDeveloper activity\nThe HS: Rivals devs are really active. We're seeing new raids, temporary missions and PvP leagues each week. They're also patching the game, fixing bugs and balancing minions. Kudos for such active devs.\n\nLategame\nThe lategame is basically all about replaying that final mission on 'auto' while waiting for a new raid to come up. Maybe play a few PvP matches here and there. It's not the most glorious of endgames but they're still working on the game. I'd bet we'll see a better lategame in half a year or so.\n\nPort\nIf you hadn't already figured it out, HS: Rivals is a port from a mobile game. While the game (so far) runs smoothly, it basically looks like an upscaled version of the mobile game. There UI is by far too big, there's no volume sliders (only on/off), no keybindings (not even ESC) etc etc.\n\nIf you're not enjoying the game on Steam or if you just don't wanna try because of the port, do at least try the mobile version. It comes with all the pros and without the silly port.","May 23","true","32.7"," 32 of 64 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","32","64","3","3"

Heavenstrike Rivals is originally a mobile game that's been ported onto Steam, so yes of course it's going to have those grindy elements of a standard mobile game with stamina, collecting units etc. In saying that, this is one of the better ones with actual tactical elements to it, not just some mindless battles that are solely decided by units' stats and solely for the purpose of grinding. If you're just putting down your units without putting any thought into it, then you're doing it wrong, and you also wouldn't be able to clear the harder contents without some actual thinking.\n\nAlso, you really don't have to pay a single cent to play this game. You need "crystals" to get the better units but the game itself is pretty generous at giving you these crystals through quests, daily logins etc. And the stamina cap? I've been playing for approximately 6 hours by the time I wrote this review and I haven't run out of stamina yet because it keeps refreshing everytime you level up, and you level up very quickly in the beginning.\n\nI personally only started this game when it arrived on Steam. I downloaded it on my phone and made an account, but decided to delete it later on since it was taking up space without ever playing it, so I wouldn't know how the PC version differs from the mobile version. Honestly though, I have no problems with it so far so if you like mobile games like Brave Frontier, Summoners War or Chain Chronicles, I think you would find this game very addicting.","May 27","true","10.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","0"

You can skip it to the big LANDING ZONE, down there. So, if you want, Jumpto LANDING ZONE)\n\nBecause his is the top review right now, I will make a similar one of what it would be for a player whose PC doesn't have a clear problem. Because he's the only one complaining (emphasis on complaining, instead of reviewing) about this, we can assume the problem is with his PC's compatibility.\n\nHere goes:\n- Install the game.\n- Hit play.\n- Volume was just fine, but I lowered it a bit so I wouldn't disturb my sister watching TV here in my room. She didn't complain at all.\n- Options menu was on the right lower side, represented by the obvious gear icon which every gamer should know what means by now.\n- Play tutorial, didn't even bother trying to find an option to leave since I actually wanted to learn how to play the game, which I did pretty quickly.\n- Never seen a button for "show me adds". They didn't shove anything I didn't want to my face. Also, I'm not sure if you can even show adds in a game running on Steam. If you could, I wouldn't have so much trouble looking for ways to monetize a game I'm developing with my friends.\n- Alt-tabbed once to send an e-mail to a friend who asked me to draw him a logo. He was pleased. Went back into the game.\n- The task manager is working just fine.\n- I could turn off the pc, but won't.\n\n(LANDING ZONE\n\nNow that I got this out of my chest, here's the review.\n\nHeavenstrike Rivals is a pc version for the mobile game of same name developed by Square Enix.\nThis game seems to allow you to sync it with your account for the mobile version, so even if this gets lots of mixed reviews, it still got the userbase from the mobile, who must be really excited about being able to play it on Steam.\nBut for those who didn't play it on mobile, like me, it's still a quite enjoyable game, IF you have nothing against the energy system, which you shouldn't, because you can just play this in intervals between other games.\n\nSo, on with the game. It's a turn-based game where you deploy units on a lane, and then they move on their on. It's important to understand how the units will move and attack, because summoning them or changing lanes at the right time can mean the difference between winning and losing.\n\nThe cool thing about the units is that they are collectibles. There are tons of different units with different rarity ranks which you can level and eventually promote, making them stronger. Higher rank units have personal abilities, some that can be really game changing. Those ranks range from 1 to 5 stars.\nAfter getting some, you can organize them in a squad. During a fight, you start with 4 units and every turn a random member of your squad will join the roster. Thinking of synergies, summoning cost and abilities is really important when building a squad.\n\nSo, how do you get those units? There are 3 ways.\nYou can go on missions, which is basically what you want to do the most in the game until you have really good units.\nThe mission diary. It's the red book on the left side of the main screen which gives you quests and eventually dailies.\nRecruiting with Cores. Which can be bought with IRL money. Or earned in-game. Both ways require a great deal of effort, so pick what's best for you. (Money requires a great deal of effort from your parents, kids. Make sure to pay them with equal effort in your studies.)\n\nThe one that wields the best results is the cores, which gives you 3-star rank or higher units.\n5 cores lets you recruit 1 unit. 45 lets you recruit 10 at once. There are discounts sometimes for 10 at once scouts, so keep an eye for them.\nWhen using cores, it's known among gamers who play games with this kind of system that you must NEVER, EVER, E-V-E-R, Solo Yolo. What is Solo Yolo? It's falling for that 1-unit only trap. If you can get 10 units with 45 cores, getting 1 with 5 means you would be spending 50 for 10 units. You are losing 5 cores! That's 1 unit! Maybe more (discounts, remember?). It's much better to keep your cores safe in your piggybank and spend them all at once when you get enough for a 10-unit recruitment. Trust me, every "pro" player or youtuber in these games says this.\n\nNow for PvP. Here's the thing. People are saying this is pay-to-win. They are wrong. This is pay-to-get-things-done-much-faster-than-if-you-actually-put-a-lot-of-effort-in-getting-through-the-main-game.\nThe thing is, core prices are high. Higher than most people would be willing to pay.\nThose who are, either pay a lot to get a lot of 10-unit recruitments and get a lot of strong units, or pay less and get a few more good units than you do. That means that those who pay a lot will quickly rise to the upper tiers and won't be playing with other low levels, but instead with high levels or people who also paid. They just jumped to a few months in the future, you won't see them once they get to where they're supposed to be. Which means, most of the time at low levels, you will be playing with non-paying players, like me, or those who didn't pay enough to get a good enough team to crush us flat so easily.\n\nAlso, as I said, you can EARN cores, through old good in-game effort. Your best friends are main story missions and the mission diary. Those let you earn A LOT of cores. They will eventually end, but I estimate you won't finish them until at least a few months. And I still haven't unlocked dailies, which in these kinds of games tend to give you a few IRL money tokens, like the cores.\n\nIn PvP, don't expect to be winnning many games without at least 3/4 of your squad being 4-star rank or very good 3-star rank. I should probably get a 5-star rank before you even try it too. You will get those from 10-unit recruitment. In the first 3 hours (without rushing, just taking my time checking everything I could and learning), I managed to get 115 cores. That gives me 20 units of 3-star or higher. Also, if you don't get a 5-star after 20 units recruited, you will get one guaranteed 5-star. That's worse case scenario. If you are lucky, you will get some really good units. I got in these two recruitments three 5-stars and more 4-stars than I'm even using. And I haven't had trouble in PvP so far, though I didn't play much because there's still a lot of main story to do and I can probably get much stronger and reach better ranks in PvP.\n\nSo, if you are starting now, my tips are:\n\n- Make use of those initial levels. Everytime you level up your energy will fill up, so you can play for hours straight in the beggining.\n- Do main story missions. Those are designed to give you what you need to start the game. Those who ignore them will be left behind by those who don't.\n- Do the mission diary quests. They give you items, they give you units, they give you cores. Do them, and more will show up.\n- Don't Solo Yolo. That's essencially losing units, not getting them. Do 10-unit recruitment, always!\n- PvP unlocks on level 5. You can check it out, but don't bother too much with it. You might be facing people who are playing for much longer than you are. It's fair if you lose to them. So focus on getting stronger for now.\n- Keep an eye on the news. It's the orange button with an antenna on the top-left side of the main screen. Sometimes there are crazy events going on, like this Fullmetal Alchemist event which I still can't find anywhere in the game, but will keep looking T.T\n- Seriously. Don't Solo Yolo. DON'T.","May 24","true","22.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

As a long time TCG player it's refreshing to find a card game so UNIQUE.  The "squad" based deck building allows you as the player to be creative with your "unit" card choices while still having a powerful competitive deck.  The character art is captivating and if you're a fan of characters in other Square Enix titles you'll surely find yourself wanting to collect them all.  HSR offers a unique RPG aspect as well.  It will take time to level your units before utilizing their full potential in combat.  The single player campaign contains over 70 missions accompanied by a classic rpg story line.  In keeping with their unique style, HSR offers a raiding system allowing you to play against the AI alongside your friends!  Different units are good at different things, some will be better for raiding and others for battle against other players.  With many ways to earn powerful units and in game currency to purchase units, spending money is NOT required, despite what you may hear from salty players unwilling to invest the time required to build powerful squads.  As a new player, the matchmaking system will ensure that you are matched against players of equal experience WHEN POSSIBLE, but if there are no players of your experience level in queue, you may end up matched against players with more powerful squads.  I remember being frustrated as a new player when this happened, but if you're willing to invest the time, it's extremely rewarding when you finally climb to the top and build a squad powerful enough to compete.  After completeing the campaign, you can replay the missions for a chance at new units.  HSR releases new "event" missions on a weekly basis to ensure that you're able to continue obtaining stronger units.

I have only played single player missions so far, but from what I have seen to PVP at any decent level it can get pretty cash heavy. Heavenstrike Rivals has a pretty nice soundtrack, and decent art. The gameplay itself is enjoyable for the most part but besides PVP being "unbalanced" I have had the issue of having the game run at the right size. So far I have just playing the game windowed.

I've put a lot of time into it and feel the need to recommend it to others. So I'm gonna go ahead and give this a thumbs up and I'll tell you why. I can't really speak for the PvP because that's not why I played this game. But if you're looking for a fun little distraction that will allow you to keep progress in sync between your phone and PC (there aren't many of those), this is a good one and I don't understand why it's getting so much hate.\n\nThe port needs some work--I won't argue with that. It's functional but it would be nice to see higher frame rates and more options better suited to PC. The game iself has a nice art style and music from respected artists and composers involved with Final Fantasy games. It has simple yet fun gameplay, and heck it even has a story! Not a great story by any means, but it at least has some witty dialogue here and there. Collecting units is fun. There are lots of cross-over events bringing in characters from Final Fantasy, Full Metal Alchemist, and more. They give out free stuff regularly.\n\nSure, it's no Hearthstone in terms of PvP battles or balance. But the game certainly isn't bad if you play it for the campaign and unit collection. It's actually quite good as long as you aren't expecting a load of depth. Even with the free-to-play model I never once felt forced to pay my way to victory while playing through the story.\n\nTLDR: It's free. Check it out yourself if you're on the fence. You may find a fun little gem.","May 25","true","0.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It's a fun experience that will have you planning each move carefully.  It's free, but as with all of these types of games you can spend money to get more units or make them stronger.  Also like other games of the genre, the game locks you out from playing after a certain amount of energy is spent.  You must wait for the energy to refill or spend money to refill it.\n\nGameplayA game in a similar vein to Hearthstone, but with the addition of placement on the battlefield driving when and who a character attacks.  There are 3 lanes and your units automatically move forward in the lane you chose to move them in, with the possibility for you to change their lane on your turn as well (if they're not taunted).  There are many different units to choose from (after you've collected them), so the strategic options seem very vast.  However, as with all these types of games, I'm sure time will end up with certain builds dominating the arenas.\n\nNotesThere's a story mode and PVP mode.\nMusic with some short motifs from the Final Fantasy series, though mostly all original tunes.\nThe character designs are interesting, and the item get effects feel rewarding when acquiring new troops.\nA helpful, if not long winded, tutorial at the beginning.\nThe world map where you pan around to find different events on it.\nThe story dialogue progresses very sharply, but is enjoyable.  It's obvious the focus is more on the collect-a-thon and not the story like most SquareEnix games do.\nSome very strange UI layout decisions that I hope will be addressed in the future.\nSome of the animation transitions aren't very smooth, like zooming back in and out for enemies with multi-strike skills.\nResponse of the game in general is kind of laggy.  It would be nice if delays between actions and animations were shortened much more.\nThe game favors certain units over others.  If you're lucky enough to get a few good ones from the store, set the best as your captain and you're good to go for quite a while without extra thought.\nOn the note of favoring units, don't bother to PVP until you have a full squad of legendary units, otherwise you're just cruisin' for a bruisin'.\nYou get loot as rewards after combat.\nMost of your character recruitment is done through points you can earn.  These are randomly chosen characters, and you can't choose manually without money.\nDaily login rewards, which can be increased if paying cash for "monthly tickets"\nDifferent difficulty modes to choose from for better rewards.\nCuratorI love to share good games with other RPG fans!

Thank the lord!!!\nYou might look at this and wonder what the hell it is?! Well it`s a direct port of the mobile game with the same name. I`ve been playing Heavenstrike Rivals on my phone fro almost an entire year and it`s been a blast.\nYou will love this game if you are a fan of any of the following: Heroes of Might and Magic, Magic the Gathering, Final Fantasy and any collecting game you enjoy.\nYou summon your heroes from cards that have a fixed mana cost and may upgrade them to slightly increase the stats on the character. After they battle in a style similar to Heroes of Might and Magic and it`s one of the best turn based strategy games ever. A good use of classes and skills is required.\nPVP is the bread and butter of Heavenstrike Rivals with leagues and arenas with special rules being available. For others such as myself there is the RAID!!! The raid pits 2 captains against a powerfull boss for greater rewards.\nFight using characters from the Heavenstrike universe and also get characters from Final Fantasy or other Square Enix games.\nWith great gameplay and lots of content especially once you reach a higher level and league this game is an excellent example of passion turning into a high quality game.\nSome people might argue that you need to pay to have a chance in PVP...well they are wrong and lazy (or braindead) you can farm amazing characters and if you train them you can dominate your enemies in PVP. Also be on the lookout for special characters events which can give you an upper hand in the game. Patience and a good strategy will get you far in this game.\nThe devs are active and always livestreaming when new content is available and also respond fast to community messages.

Has very few pc specific options, all i've seen as of yet is changing your resolution.\n\nwith all of that said, if you play heavenstrike on mobile, and like the idea of playing on a bigger screen, there's no reason i can think of that you shouldn't install it. go ahead and link your accounts and have some fun. i know i will :)","May 24","true","3.7"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","9","0","0"

There are 3 modes in Raids. Hard mode is ridiculous hard, like 10x harder than medium, some ppl did like 15x hard raid and only drop legendary unit once :D\n\nDracula, Blade maiden, St. Georgie, Minstrel, juliet are ridiculous broken in this game and u will see these units swarming arenas :D\n\nWhen u recruit a unit, their skill starts at R1 and max is R5, u need to feed them a unit with the exact same skill to lvl up their skill (most of the time the same exact unit), so some legendaries u pull from $$$ summon can get really shetty at skill R1 and only be usable at R5\n\nIn summary, u need to pull the exact same legendary unit 4 times to max their skills to be relevant but with the rate in $$$ summon, it wont be happening or u need a lot $$$$$$$$ :D","May 26","true","34.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, there are a noticeable amount of those interface graphics that are not the same resolution or are not properly aligned as of June 2016. The very first interface stuff after you hit "PLAY" has some flipped image for the middle section of their "Loading..." dialog box model. As another example, if you open the squad editing screen where you can edit a specific squad, the right side of the top of the interface has a gap for 1280x720 (and probably more resolutions). Furthermore, if you actually read through the story missions, you'll meet a character pretty quickly named "Olivia". You'll see her name a lot of times through the story... and then it'll be "Olive" later. Maybe it's supposed to be an endearing foreshortening, but I doubt it. I doubt it because the little colored boxes that mark out your side versus your opponent's side never ever align with the actual art.\n\nIf you can get past all that, the core game is a fun kind of challenge once you get to the special event-type encounters. If you've ever played a game where there's a specific piece that is perfect for the job and you draw it, that's the kind of enjoyment you can expect out of this game. Compound that with new unit offerings and events every couple of days, and it's pretty entertaining.\n\nLastly, if you want 5 free cores, you can put in a friend invite code after you pass the tutorial and the bottom buttons show up on the world map (MORE -> Scroll down to ENTER INVITE CODE -> paste with CTRL+V). Cores are used for the new (and recycled) unit promotions. They are also used to restore your energy bar to max and as a CONTINUE? feature if you get defeated in the middle of an event. There are also quality of life things they can buy. Without spending money, you can earn more of these things by doing story missions (1 time), daily missions, mission objectives, the Core Collector mission (once a day), the Hardcore Core Collector mission (after what's done of the story is completed), and getting other people to use your invite code. My invite code is: CPT5F0C31F6\n\nIf you use it, thanks, and try not to let their overuse of the word "Captain" bother you too much.","June 4","true","31.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is literally no way to excell in this game in arenas without putting money into it. You will always be at a massive disadvantage. The game starts off easy, but soon you will not be able to do anything without more Legendary characters, and if you are not willing to pay for these, it takes a very long time to earn the crystals to buy them. This game could be good, but the grind to make yourself relevant is absured, and the game basically forces you into paying for the content if you want to even remotely compete.\n\n\nGameplay itself, I enjoy, but the Pay 2 Win business model is horrible, therefore I can not ever recommend any game like this.","June 5","false","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
