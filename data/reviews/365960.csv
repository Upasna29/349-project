It most certainly lacks in some departments compared to the competitor sims but what matters the most to me- the driving experience, rFactor2 destroys anything else on the market. Its tyre model is so detailed you really need to know what you are doing in order to replicate results from real life race. This is the sim that helped me to understand how hard racing can be and showed me atleast small fraction of what real life racing drivers have to go through in pursue of victory.\nThe rF2 community takes full advantage of the wide moddability and thanks to the steam workshop, this is now made even better and easier with everything being updated automatically.\nRealistic day and night cycles allow players to replicate some amazing WEC races. There isnt anything more rewarding than finishing 8 hour race after 2 driver swaps. Long races is where all the features of rF2 come to life. If you are here just for a 10 lap quickies, rF2 is not going to shine as much as on realistic race lenghs.\n\nCombining the fact that rF2 is the most pure and raw hardcore experience available with the fact that Image Space Inc are not bunch of profit seeking leeches, rF2 is a nobrainer.\nAll new content released by ISI is free for all people already own rF2, no paid DLCs, no microtransactions.\nLove this sim.","November 12, 2015","true","101.4"," 161 of 193 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","161","193","9","16"

I will tell you this - rFactor 2 is the best driving race sim out there, bar none. The force Feedback is sublime (with a decent wheel), the AI is the best in the industry and the overall race experience is just unparalleled.\n\nUnfortunately, if you're looking for multiplayer racing, the online component has always been, let's just say, unpopulated... The only way to really get any good MP racing has always been to join a league (of which there are plenty). Hopefully this move to STEAM will fix that and we'll finally have some populated pub servers for pick-up racing.\n\nI'll be honest, nowadays I get my MP fix with iRacing, but rF2 is my go too sim for single player racing. It's just so damn good. I'd really love to see that change now that rF2 is on STEAM. Just need to get some new players to take the plunge. Pretty decent modding scene as well, that's only getting better.\n\nFair warning, rFactor 2 does take a pretty beastly rig to run and is really only truly enjoyed with a decent FFB wheel and pedal set. This is not one for the hand-me-down old laptop users. For those I'd recommend rF1/GTR 2/Game Stock Car.","November 12, 2015","true","24.5"," 66 of 79 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","66","79","7","0"

Like, wtf is that. Even I have more respect for rF2 than that! :(\n\nUpdate: I stand by my initial review, which has remained unchanged below. However, while I don't recommend the game in it's current state as something for the starting user, if you love racing I highly recommend you buy it anyways! The game offers one of the best physics engines, if not the best, in the industry, and supporting ISI will only make the entire game better in the future. It gets updated often and already has an amazing feature set. The issues I have with the game can only be improved with time and support!\n\nI've also updated my thoughts on Force Feedback and explained what I ment by "faked effects", as I do not believe other users realized I was speaking about the vibration effects that cannot be done realistically by most current hardware. I also am cleaning up the pros and cons to give a much more concise list of positives and negatives. Again, please support ISI and buy this game if you love racing, but please do your research if you haven't played many racing sims and your experience is limited to Need for Speed and Project Cars.\n\nPros:\n\nAmazing physics\nMod support\nCustom Rule plugins\nDay/Night Cycles\nRain\nAI is uncomparable to any other game. (I swear one stayed stopped on the side of the road until after a set of cars passed after it spun out!)\n\nCons:\n\nPhysics are not 100% perfect despite anyone's comments. Rubber buildup isn't perfect, and the damage model is lacking (heavily lacking. Some cars don't even get damaged visually)\nSounds are strange\nUnoptimized graphics system\nRain does not appear on car/windshield\nNot all the cars are kept up to date\nPoor mulitplayer system (great for leagues, sucks for public racing)\n\nrFactor 2 is a fantastic sim for a cost-saving consumer, offering more in physics compared to Assetto Corsa or Project Cars. Rubber builds up pretty realistically, tracks made directly by ISI are gorgeous, and many of the mods are fantastic.\n\nIt's great in league settings and playing against AI, but unfortunately that's where my excitement about the game ends. While many users may disagree with me, I feel it's physics are a bit half-baked in some areas. While it's real-road system is pretty cool, it's no longer unique and does not offer the temp-based system that a competitor, iRacing, offers. The other issue comes with the accuracy of the tracks. While it's true that, often times, a surveyed track can compare to a scanned track in terms of looks, it does not matter if it doesn't feel right. This is often commented on the mod version of Nurburgring, where the rFactor 2 version is often not accurate in terms of the bumps found on the track when compared to other games, such as assetto corsa, that uses a laser scan copy of the track.\n\nOther issues I find with the game is it's confusing UI, the outdated engine that is struggling to keep up, and the community. I gave this game plenty of chance. I played it for over 2 years and nearly exclusivly for almost 4 months this past summer [I didn't have internet], letting my iRacing sub lapse and really trying to give it a go for my money's worth...\n\nIt left me bored. Without an online ranking system, there isn't a point. I don't have the time or energy to join a league, and the AI is great but still doesn't compare to the thrill of racing a human driver. While the tire physics are quite out of this world, the FFB has obvious faked effects to try to make it easier to tell what's going on, but it disrupts my driving. This is mostly noticable when it tries to make "vibration" effects, something that cannot be done by 90% of hardware on the market, and is ineffectivly done by the Fanatec BMW racing wheel, as most racing wheels only contain rotational FFB hardware.\n\nThe only other major thing it had going for it, the real road effect, has been brought to other games in some effect, whether it's the lap-by-lap system done by AC or the real-time dynamic track brought in by iRacing.\n\nIn terms of the buy-and-drive games without a subscription, the lifetime version of rFactor 2 is the best simulation out there. Unfortunately, it's plagued by multiple issues that have yet to be fixed after a near 6 years in development. I hope the release on Steam creates enough income to let them proceed faster with their development, but at this current time I cannot recommend this game to anyone but true racing enthusiasts, if only to try it out to see what's in the current competition or to those who want an EXCELLENT offline experience.\n\nAs of their latest updates, iRacing and rFactor 2 feel quite similar. rFactor 2 no longer suffers from it's wonky tire physics,  and iRacing hasn't felt like ice in over a year. I can drive the stock cars almost identically between the two games. Other cars are harder to test due to differences in tracks and the cars available.\n\nIt's the package itself that bothers me. rFactor 2 could do great things, but it feels their development team does not put enough effort into providing content and rely on third party creations, which lowers the overal value of the game to me.\n\nCreating a world that is consistant, that is how racing thrives. iRacing has accomplished this. Assetto Corsa is good about this too. rFactor 2 suffers solely on this issue, which is in truth, it's only major flaw.\n\nI will update my review when rFactor 2 shows the world that it is truly capable of being a place for sim racers.\n\n(Please note that I bought the life time upgrade after paying for 2 yearly subscriptions over the past 3-4 years. I want the developers to improve this game, so I gave them support in terms of my wallet. I also bought this game for 3 of my friends, because I wanted them to try it out and, again, to give ISI some support. I do not hate this game, nor do I feel that iRacing is 100% the answer either. Everyone will have their own opinion, but I hope that people do not feel blinded by passion.

Play with the settings.\nThe default car setups are not very good to drive. Main reason: They want to force you to take sim time\nwith the car setup. Every race driver has to know a lot of thing about car setups.\n\nI have all race sim games since REVS on C64 and that are a lot of games.\nrfactor 2 is different so these games, it is a race simulator. If you like games where you enter, play a few laps and be happy,\nchoose something different.\n\nIn rfactor 2 you have to lern a lot of things about driving, car setups and race technics. You have play around\ndifferent configuration (graphics, sound and FFB) before you are happy.\n\nBut if you invest time and money for good hardware you got the best available racing sim.\nFor me its part of the game to lern how to drive the cars at the different track.\nIts takes some time to lern that not every car makes fun on every track.\n\nYou must find a good combination car and track. E.g. try the Palatow D4 at Mills Inner Loop C: Amazing.\nSet race start time at 5:30 PM, time acceleration 10x and drive a 10 lap race.\nThen you will get a perfect sim experience. The sun goes down and the lighting beside the track goes\non and you recognise that it becomes much harder to drive without daylight.\n\nI have rf2 now since more then 2 years and since 2 month I back to this sim.\n\nPublic online racing is pretty dead, but nearly all public online racing lobbies are empty.\nYou will find most players in AC but these server are not good for real racing.\nToo many wreckers :-(\n\nIts no problem to find a good rf2 league with fair drivers.\nEven the public servers are filled with a few good drivers. Nothing for a quick game, but a great area to improve\nyour driving skills. You take a look how these drivers perform. You can lern a lot while watching.\n\nIf unsure try the rf2 demo I dont like the rf2 demo content. Silverstone is boring. Believe me, the others tracks are much more beautiful.\n\nOr start with the offline version. Its not very expensive. You get through steam workshop at lot of content for free !\n\nWith a good setup, rf2 can look like this:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1wnTra1yYw\n\nand this mod is currently in progess:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBMe9xqFqEY\n\nI someone has problems with rfactor2, go to the isiforum or racedepartment and ask a question.

Especially some of the more fleshed out cars will really test your driving ability.\nTo make the experience even more authentic I recommend you have a good steering wheel with solid FFB (Without this it can be harder to drive certain cars, especially those with a tendancy to spin out of corners!)\nThe car setup tool gives you the ability to create setups for your car, this can go really in depth but there are tutorials around that can help you get started.\nThe one drawback this game has is the graphics, not a problem for many people as most just want to drive, if you are here for the graphics then I suggest you look at some other games as this is not what the simulation is about.\nOverall, this is the best simulation available. (There is a reason almost all Formula 1 teams and other top tier racing teams use rFactor Pro and not Project Cars!).","November 13, 2015","true","152.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Some of the best driving physics found on any racing sim to date, especially the tyre model which is extremely realistic.\n2. Based on realism the graphics in rFactor 2 are in my opinion outstanding , the draw distance, colour pallette and hdr textures, especially on the road surface are pretty much as good as it gets.\n3 The UI is pretty basic at first glance but does offer indepth configuration for every aspect of the game.\n4. Force Feedback , easily one of the best Force feedback systems you will find in any game, this is due to the fact that is directly linked to the tyre model, which means you can accurately detect loss of traction/grip at any speed,unlike many force feedback systems which feel predictable.\n5.Dedicated server support and online multiplayer are available to those who subscribe. (optional)\n6. Customisation and mod support has always been a big part of rFactor , rFactor 2 is no different , however being a newer game and the jump in technical ability requirments, this has led to less quantity and less quality mods being released. (give it some more time)\n7. The AI in rFactor 2 are configurable which allows you to set skill/speed and aggression, definitely the least frustrating AI I have played against in all modern sims.\n8. Superb performance , I run rFactor 2 in surround mode (triple screens 5760x1080) with everything maxed out , the game looks amazong and framerates are consistantly 100+ depending on track, always above 75fps though.\n\nWhat not to expect from rFactor 2\n\n1. The main thing most newcomers will notice is the lack of branding or licensing. ( for me this is not a problem)\n2. A mainstream game which has a limited life expectancy,\n3. A game that holds your hand.\n4..DLC\n\nrFactor 2 accurately simulates a speeding race car (really well) , be it a formula or stock car, as well as any simulator I have ever used , there are many other well known great sims on the market, rFactor 2 deserves to sit at the top table of racing sims and imo is an absolute must buy sim for anyone who loves motorsport or racing sims.\n\nan easy 10/10.","January 5","true","25.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","12","15","3","0"

The tire model is beyond any of the other sims, due to the clarity and depth of both the tire model and the ffb - make this a joy to drive any of the cars. There is a variety of cars to drive (from Clio's/BTCC Honda - all the way to modern FR3.5 cars and all the way back to the vintage 1960's F1 cars. And the tire model manages to deal with the different cars just fine.\n\nTracks arent laser scanned, but well produced and feel alive due to the lifelike bumps and everchanging weather/rubber changes throughout a session.\n\nIn terms of graphics, this is where most do not like rf2. If you want a naturalistic and simplistic approach to sims, then rf2 will do just fine.\n\nDo I reccommend this? for anyone keen to drive & race and enjoy it with a wheel?

To cut to the chase, rFactor2 is a brilliant racing simulator.  It offers a very robust and detailed physics engine, coupled with an excellent tyre model, which will punish bad driving and reward good driving, in a way I have yet to see in other games/sims .  As well as employing some very cool features, such as proper tyre deformation, both physical and visual, this includes the ability to flatspot a tyre(s) and also tyre curing (hardening of the tyre from overheating).\n\nrFactor2 also features full 24 hour day/night cycles and dynamic weather.  Although the latter is still, to a certain degree, a work in progress.  rFactor2 also features a dynamic track surface, aka real road, which means a track will "rubber in", based on where and how cars drive on the track.   This also applies to a wet track which is drying out too, so you will see a dry line start to form.\n\nThe force feedback is, in my honest opinion, the best there is at the moment, however results may vary based on the type of wheel you are using, but this is the case for any racing game, in my experience.  I currently use a Thrustmaster T500rs, and it pretty much works perfectly on default settings, although you will most likely want to tweak settings here and there to suit your own personal preferences.\n\nrFactor2 is a "constantly evolving product" which means new updates to the game itself, as well as the content, are released on a regualr basis (generally every 6-8 weeks there will be something new/updated, although there is no official timescale for releases/updates).  Because of this constantly evolving nature, there are, some areas of rFactor2, where it is a little rough round the edges.  A good example of this is the weather system, at least from a visual standpoint, needs to be finished at this present time, however it will no doubt be addressed in the near future.\n\nThe game can seem quite daunting to someone who has never played any of ISI's earlier titles i.e. rFactor (1) and indeed there is a huge amount of settings/customisation that can be done, either via the in-game UI or through fiddling with settings in the JSON game files.\n\nOnline multiplayer is good, but don't expect the same as something like iRacing, unless you join a organised league.\n\nTo sum up, here are my PRO's and CON's for rF2.\n\nPROS:\n\n1.)  Excellent physics engine.\n2.)  State of the art tyre model.\n3.)  Very detailed force feedback.\n4.)  Dynamic track surface.\n5.)  Dynamic weather\n6.)  Full 24 hour cycle\n7.)  Continually evolving product, meaning new features and content are reguarly added, as well as exisiting content and features updated too.\n8.)  All ISI released content and updates are FREE and always will be.  Even if you let your online subscription run out.\n9.)  Lots of 3rd party content available.\n10.)  Excellent AI for some truly epic offline races.\n\nCONS:\n\n1.)  Some aspects/features are a bit unfinshed at the time of writing this review.\n2.)  As with many racing games/sims, rFactor 2 is quite resource hungry and requires a reasonably good PC to run it with all the graphics turned up and lots of cars on track.\n3.)  Online multiplayer can be hit and miss sometimes, unless you sign up to an organised league.\n4.)  rFactor 2 can be quite complicated to use and setup, to someone new.\n\nIn short, if you like racing games and you like them hyper realistic and packed with features, get rFactor 2, you won't regret it!","November 21, 2015","true","364.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/azynkron/recommended/365960/","azynkron","BadTrip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/azynkron/","282 products in account","I can tell you the sole reason for why I bought this game: Mclaren MP4/6. Yep. That's it.\nI have several other racing sim games that all are good, but when I heard that car's screaming V12 I just had to drive it.\n\nSo, how does it stand against the other sims?\n\nFirst thing, it's DX9 only. For better or for worse. Now, I don't really care that much about graphics in these kind of games since it's way more about the physics that is important. With that said, yes, it does look like it's older cousins (GTR2, Race07 e t c) so it's definitely not ugly but don't expect all that fancy stuff that PCars, Assetto and the others bring to the table. In all honesty, with DX9 being the base, I would actually expect a bit higher FPS.\n\nGraphics: 6/10 (maybe a 7/10 if you consider it's DX9)\n\nNow to the important stuff, the physics.\n\nIt's well on par with all the rest of them. I had 0 issues getting the FF and everything else to work with my G27.\nIt delivers what you expect a sim racer to deliver and it feels very dynamic. You will have to spend time tinkering with your car to get it to suit your driving style but that's why we play these kind of games. Like I said, if you have another sim game you will get what you expect. I have one critisism though and that is that track edges and curbs are a bit exaggerated in the handling. I don't know if it's the cars or if it's the engine itself, but YES, you can drive the curbs without losing traction completely in real life.\n\nPhysics 9/10. (That's actually what I would give all the sim racers I have including the new ones).\n\nConnecting back to the reason for why I bought the game, content. It's actually kind of slim out of the box both with cars and tracks. I myself am in no way whatsoever interested in 10 different oval tracks. But.. here is where modding comes in. The game supports Steam Workshop and I don't think I've ever had a racing game where it's easier to add more stuff. Browse the Steam WS, click subscribe and the next time you fire up the launcher the stuff is there. It will, of course, also keep track of any updates to what you have subscribed to. But wait, it doesn't end there (I know, that sounds like TV shopping). There are tons of tracks, cars and entire leagues you can download and it's almost as easy as Steam WS.\nDownload and extract if necessary to a folder somewhere, point the launcher to include that folder, refresh and it shows up and you can install. Brilliant. I simply love racing from the 80's (F1 or Group C or 5 doesn't matter). I love the pureness and raw feeling without ESC, ABS and TC. The downside is that from what I've seen, rFactor had more enthusiasts that made stuff than to rFactor 2. But, with one install I got all the teams from F1 1992. You can't go wrong with that.\n\nContent and modding support: 10/10\n\nLast but not least, Online racing (yes ladies and germs, that is what you eventually have to do if you want to prove that you can handle 800bhp on a track). Of course racing against your brothers and sisters is way more fun than the AI. And here is where I think they messed up. They chose a subscription model similar to iRacing and even if I can see that it keeps the riff-raff out of the lobbies, it also limits the population. Remember, PCars and the others have no extra fees for online racing. They even support dedicated servers that you can rent. So, yes, this is a mistake since I think that the user base is the most important thing for keeping it alive and, in this case, the mods to keep coming. And with this subscription model you simply will only get the die hard fans (likely the same guys that race rFactor) to pay up. I don't agree to this model since I can't see what added value it would give me. It feels like a pay wall.\n\nOnline: 0/10\n\nWith all this said, do I recommend it? Yep, I do. Without a doubt. And I think if they get rid of that silly online subscription model, this game will have many more years going for it.","January 16","true","24.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

But the best thing I can say about it is it feels incomplete.\n\nThe things that rfactor 2 does, it does best. It has fantastic FFB & driving dynamics. Ever changing track conditions, tires, temps, to my eyes one of the most natural & realistic visuals, great A.I, and on and on. But it somehow feels unfinished. It is a little short on content, but does have a decent modding community which is now a part of Steam's workshop.\n\nrFactor 2 is an ever evolving title, and if you can stick with it, it will reward you from time to time. It is beautifully immersive with great sounds, 24hr day cycles (hello night racing!) full weather cycles, full car systems such as tire temps, brake temps, water, and oil, etc.\n\nI recommend this game for driving purists. It is a demanding title, and will require you to work on your driving technique & style, car set up, constantly aware of track conditions, line racing, and fighting for position.  If this sounds overwhelming to you, perhaps check out other titles such as Assetto Corsa. If not, you cannot go wrong with rFactor 2, and similarly Automobilista.\n\nOver all 7.5/10.\n\nPS: Keep in mind that online racing is paid via subscription.

Graphics are not the greatest compared to some others but ISI more than make up for that with A Grade Physics & Tire Model, I'll add that even with a mid-range PC you can get a decent FPS count with decent looking graphics, a top end PC will benefit greatly and at the end of the day it's the feeling that counts. Speaking of which the FFB is superb on my T300 (and G25 before that).\n\nAnyway I won't go into full feature length details as nothing beats trying for yourself, so go and grab the demo and give it whirl, I highly recommend this game/sim.","May 5","true","31.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I tried multiple and never felt that connection to the road that AC gave me.\nI tried rFactor 2 years ago, the demo turned me off, and I had forgotten about it since.\n\nAfter picking it up ive decided its a near perfect replacement for AC.\nThe physics are spot on, and the tuning feels more robust than AC, with more potential as well.\nDay and night and weather are all welcome additions, though neither of these things are well polished.\nThe graphics are a noticable downgrade from AC as well, but they aren't 'bad'. just missing some flash.\n\nMy only real issue with this game is the lack of content.\nEven with modding, there just isn't much out yet. I hope this changes, because I really enjoy what IS there.\n\nThe AI seems questionable as well, often riding their brakes through corners... A flaw that reminds me heavily of the AI in Forza. Not great.\n\nBut, if you're itching for a realistic racing sim, this is a great choice.\nThe future of the game seems bright, but we will see how things go...","March 7","true","12.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

That said, it blows every other sim out of the water when it comes to Force Feedback and Physics. Seriously, I can spen more time in one car, on one track, then I can in most sims. The tire wear, damage model, weather system and real road are some of he most incredible features, and make every single lap a different experience. When I hop in the GT2 Corvette, I am immediately transported to the track, so much so, that I am having trouble going back to other sims. And the historics...you will NOT find any better anywhere. Honestly, RF2 has spoiled me, and it made even my favorite sims fall second. It's not without it's faults though, as it is only DX9, and runs worse on my Asus ROG than any other sim. Where I would regularly get 115 FPS on high (NOT ULTRA), I am lucky to get 60 fps in RF2, and that is with certain settings (such as road reflections) turned to low. Bare in mind that the ASUS ROG in question has 12 GB of Ram and a GTX 965m, which while not the most powerful, is certainly no slouch. Coming from other platforms, the extremely detailed FFB and physics do feel odd at first, they quickly become incredible desireable, and I now depend on them. The Mod community is okay, but nothing compared to it's predeccessor, and even Assetto Corsa, though there are a few very high quality mods. They aren't as good as newer ISI content, but they still are much better than most of what you find elsewhere. Overall, I would recommend this sim for anybody with a decent wheel and a powerful enough computer, especially if they are looking for the best and most realistic SIMULATION out there. If you just want a pick up and play racing game, where you can set decent laps after your first 5 minutes though, you should probably look elsewhere. UPDATE: After spending another 250+ hours in RFACTOR 2, I can safely say that it is my favorite sim. The historics are incredible, and the open wheelers are insanely accurate. I have recently tried a professional F1 training simulator, (and had some more on track experience) and ignoring the fact that I have obviously inferior hardware, nothing else comes as close to the real deal. Rfactor 2 on the other hand is getting real close, and at times indistinguishable from what the pros use. There is a reason the Pro simulators use RFACTOR PRO. 10/10 from me and the strongest recommendation I can give....IF you think you can handle it","January 29","true","757.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The AI, the racing, the singleplayer features, the game engine - all of it unmatched by any other sim that I have.\n\nThe physics feel pretty demanding in rFactor 2. In pCARS, Raceroom and even Assetto Corsa, it's very easy to just jump in a car and drive around. In rFactor 2, you need to have finesse if you want to drive fast. It's easy to overdrive your car, causing you to overheat your tires and lose grip. You can also flatspot your tires if you lockup your brakes or lose control at a high speed, causing heavy vibrations in your wheel. I usually have similar driving styles for all the sims I have, but I have to be extra careful when I step in to rFactor 2. Bear in mind that I'm no race driver in real life. I do race karts but all I've said was based from experience in all those sims.\n\nThe AI is probably the best feature of this sim. Where else can you find AI that actively tries to defend its line when you're coming from behind? When you get behind an AI's draft, the closer you get, the more they move to the inside line to try and defend their position. You're both coming in side by side for the braking point. The AI won't give up that position so easily. He will try to outbrake you, either forcing you to go wide or go for the undercut.\n\nWhen you're ahead and the AI is behind, don't expect them to just let you be in the front in peace either. They will pressure you into mistakes. They will take advantage of the mistakes you make and they're really good at it too. They will stick their nose in the inside if they're close enough. They go 3 wide in some corners if there's enough room.\n\nThe best part is that no contact is made by the AI, usually. They still make mistakes but nothing you wouldm't expect.\n\nI've had many enjoyable races in rFactor 2 with the AI. I would even go as far and say that I've had the same level of excitement racing real people on iRacing.\n\n$85 for a lifetime subscription though? Not gonna buy that.","January 12","true","35.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

It's got the best road course AI out there.  They can actually be raced and had fun with unlike my experience with Assetto Corsa and Project Cars.  This game like rFactor 1 before it is about deep customization.  I like that I can setup races that go a set number of laps or if I want to race a specific amount of time and I can set the races to being timed races.   The FFB and tire model make the cars feel more realistic to me than any game I've driven.  The first time I figured out my FF started vibrating during a race because I'd flatspotted my tires was pretty awesome.  Real Road that has rubber build up added to the racing surface depending on where the cars are actually driving during the race is pretty cool as well.  The only other game which currenly has something like that is iRacing and they just added it a month or two ago.\n\nI also love the night racing or racing at dusk into the night.  This is also something very few games have ever had and something most of the current games do not have.\n\nIf you're not sure you'll like this game then try the demo.  Hardcore racing simulations aren't for everyone.  Personally I like driving the slower cars because they're easier to handle.  You should also try the demo because it's true the UI can be unfriendly to people who just want to get in and drive.  It was designed at a time when PC gamers were more into tinkering with their games and machines to get the most out of them without the user manual being part of the UI.  Something that's never really made sense is there are several useful settings in a text file in the game folder that aren't in the UI.  ISI has always done it this way with their games.","November 21, 2015","true","35.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/365960/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Issues: With many games on Steam once you’ve downloaded the game it’s easy to log in and get going. Unfortunately, that’s not the case with rFactor 2. You’ll download the game which includes the game’s launch program. From here the game wanted to – and needed to – download modifications from the Steam Workshop. This wasn’t a big problem. However, it then also wanted to set things up which took a small amount of time. From here I went into the game. I tried to select my controller from the load options. The game has no load option for the XBox One Controller. However, it does have a presetting for the 360 controller so that is what I selected. It never recognized my controller. I searched the Internet for a solution hoping that someone else would have experienced this issue. No luck. I did, however, find someone making a complaint about them not recognizing an entirely different controller and someone telling them to exit the game entirely and to reload. This was the solution I needed. However, I then noticed that the default settings were set to controller 2. The work through here was easy because all I needed to do from here was to set my controller settings. You’re going to want to persevere with this as the representative that I spoke with at Image Space Incorporated, Tim Whately advised that driving with keys while doable is ‘hard as hell.’\n\nUber realism: Hard as hell describing the keyboards makes it sound nightmarish. Driving with an Xbox One controller wasn’t much easier.It’s definitely playable but you can see with the amount of hard work and effort that the dev team have put into the game that uber realism has been the absolute premium. You’re not going to be playing this because it’s some arcade racer. Oh, no, it’s a fully fledged entry into the uber-realistic simulation games that have become very popular over the past couple of years. That means that the game is hard as hell and will punish you for the tiniest mistake you make on the road just as a driver’s error in professional racing would. If this sounds like the type of game that’s not for you then I don’t believe Image Space Incorporated would be apologetic – they understand that they are filling a niche and they’re doing the best job possible of being the most significant ‘game’ in that niche.\n\nA technical marvel: rFactor 2 is a technical marvel. There may be other racing games with fancier graphics. There may be other racing games with better sound. There may be other racing games that may argue that their physics system is better. However, no racing game puts all three components to a better combined quality than rFactor 2. The only area that I genuinely believe the title is let down is in a decidedly average pre-racing presentation. The menu system and other design choices before you’re out on the track could do with a complete makeover. Further, the launch program could do with a little bit of clarification. It’s more than a little confusing for your first time players let alone the casual gamers who are passionate racing fans. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy but just something a little more user friendly.\n\nAll substance: What you will find most of all in rFactor 2 is that the game is all substance. The game does not make outrageous boasts that it cannot live up to. Everything in the game is substance. It is as deep a racing experience as what you could possibly hope to find on any gaming platform. Where other games waste their budget adding unnecessary features Image Space Corporation have put in the effort on maximizing what they do have. Quite frankly, it’s one of the best racing games – of any sort – ever developed and I hope it receives the attention it deserves from the Steam universe.\n\nFinally on Steam: The game was originally released back in 2013 but only made its way onto Steam in late-2015. This gave the developers an opportunity to work on the game with their core user base without the pressure of it being classified as an Early Access title or being rushed into release before it was ready. I believe that this is a smart decision for some games and it certainly was in the case of rFactor 2.\n\nrFactor 2 is unapologetically not for everyone. The majority of those who speak out against the game are the crowd who Image Space Corporation did not make the game for. If you’re a part of the target audience, however, you’ll likely not find a better racing experience on Steam.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 19","true","2.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

One thing I do like is unlike the other games, if I bump a car in front of me or lose traction my car doesn't consistantly put my front end into the bank or wall. The game also needs more cars but my biggest complaint is the graphics. They are way outdated.

So take advantage of the current 40% off price!!!!\n\nThis new engine ISI has created has tons of potential, unfortunately ISI treats it more like a community modding platform  than a game and leaves alot for the user to create and figure out as they have stated they will not purchase any series licenses.\nI really hope a dev team like Reiza will use this engine in the future and give it a little Reiza love and push the boundaries!","November 21, 2015","false","4.6"," 12 of 32 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","12","32","2","2"

The starting wheel and car set up are so far off, it feels nothing like a sim.  And after dorking with the set up for a bit, the feeling has gotten better but know where near realistic.  When you cant get a car not to spin out and or loose control at 60 mph, simply because your breaking, (which btw, there is zero feedback for breaking) it leads to nothing but frustration.  There is also a button for the rev limiter but seemingly none of the cars have it, and like a real sim, they have zero tollerance for speeding in the pits, which in turn is just more frustration because even in practice you have to come in and serve your penelty, or be DQ. I have not tried Project Cars or Corrsa, but IMO Raceroom, and I racing are much better because the feedback and sense of speed is way more spot on to RL, and the car's actualy feels like it has tires.  The concept with the throw back cars and tracks are neat, and maybe I just need to tweak on the control setup more, but at this point and time, I really wish I would of tried the Demo because I feel like I wasted my fifty plus bucks on a game that is going to the garage.","November 21, 2015","false","11.9"," 4 of 23 people (17%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","17","4","23","11","2"

I had to reinstall the game to get it running. I just tried to install it on my SSD again and everything worked. So maybe they fixed this issue in the mean time.\n\nrfactor2 is the most realistic racing simulation at this moment.\n\nBut: On this Steam Version, just a very limited combination of cars and tracks does not lead to a crash (rfactor2 has stopped worked...).\n\nWhen the crashes are fixed I will change this review and write something about the game :)\n\nUPDATE 1: Day Later: Now the source of the problem seems to be obvious: When I start the game now it says "Downloading Workshop Items - 59 items remaining". This situation does not change after an hour, so there is a problem to download the content. This is why most tracks and cars do not work as they have not been downloaded yet. As rFactor2 is not able to download them (I just use the official Workshop Mods which are subscribed by default), this review will stay negativ until the game has been fixed\n\nUPDATE 2: Now I have reinstalled the game the second time. This time, I installed it to my normal HDD (not SSD). The reason for this was, that my Steam Folder on the SSD was unter C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam. So, maybe the (x86) was a problem for rfactor2, that it cant download to a location with special letters. Now everything works fine, my Steam Folder on my HDD is "D:\Games\Steam".

By that I mean the physics, the FFB, the dynamic changes as the race happens (tyres, weather, lighting), & the AI.  The races have a sense of speed to them, a thrill, not stale as I find with AC, the FFB is the best I've experienced through my CSWv2 and the selection of cars and tracks available by ISI, 3rd part associates or independent modders covers pretty much all aspects of motorsports on 4 wheels.\n\nThe cons of rF2 for me are that it does not have a structured career mode or even a simple championship allowing you to create and compete with the AI over a series of tracks with leaderboards.  This is a real shame as the AI is one of the best you will see in any current sim.  Also, I'm sure you have all heard about how outdated the dx9 graphics are, and at times you will agree but other times the game does look very good.  It's not bad but it does not have the polish of pCARS or the post processing of AC.  But what the graphics do achieve, is a real sense of speed which for me AC fails to do.\n\nIn summary:\n\nPros:\n+ Physics & FFB very convincing and make the 'feel' of the game superior\n+ Dynamic tracks, lighting & weather\n+ Moddable platform with some excellent free mods\n+ Very convincing AI makes single player races challenging & enjoyable, with a sense of speed and thrill that R3E achieves too.\n\nCons:\n- Graphical quality lacks polish\n- No career or championships, especially upsetting after you have such good AI\n- Sounds are not as good as R3E, AC or PCars.\n- The weather effects are incomplete\n- UI is not as polished as AC","December 30, 2015","true","108.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I respect the incredible technical achievements and amazing features that ISI have packed into the sim and I support them as licensing the rFactor 1 engine has given birth to other sims that I love, but rFactor 2 largely feels a bit lifeless and clinical - like it takes itself too seriously to be much fun. The free content that ISI offers on Steam Workshop is a nice addition because otherwise the game comes with very little in the way of stock content. The problem is that older content "feels" old and newer content gets the physics and graphics updates, but they never go back to update all of the rest of the existing content.\n\nThe AI are decent and the sounds and graphics are okay. The FFB is detailed but there are way too many canned effects added with spring and damper and the only way to adjust it is to close the sim, edit the files, and then start it up again to see if you like the new settings... it's a bit of a chore, honestly. They do provide some ability to tune FFB and control inputs from the settings within the game, but there are a few things missing here and there.\n\nAlso, you have to buy the online subscription services if you want access to multiplayer, the Steam version doesn't come with the complimentary 12-month subscription like the non-Steam version did. It's a silly and archaic model held over from their attempts to stop the rampant piracy of rFactor from the pre-Steam era and they should really just do away with it now. I only got the base game so I haven't tried the multiplayer.\n\nFinal notes: make sure you set the track to have at least light rubber, if not medium rubber, on the surface. A pristine "green" track surface will drive like ice and is no fun at all. Also, the modding community isn't super active but there are some worthwhile third party mods and tracks. I would recommend you try out the demo from ISI's website before deciding to purchase. It's not my everyday "go-to" sim, but rFactor 2 has day/night cycle and rain/weather combined with "real road" technology, so it's worth booting up every now and then.","April 13","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"

For me at least it's a strange title to place, I find the level of realism and quality of simulation with Rfactor is only as good as the current car and track that you're in, with a very wildly varying experience, the player also really needs to have at least a basic knowledge of car setup and a good understanding of wheel peripheral setup to get the right experience, it's not a fantastic "plug and play" experience.\n\nAt it's best Rfactor 2 is perhaps the best driving simulator out there, or at the very least it's on a par, but at it's worst it's let down by less than fantastic content quality that isn't helped by the equally inconsistent default setups.\n\nThe graphics were already dated when it came out back in 2012, but a bit of artistic flair and some quality lighting can make them hold up even today. The same can be said about the sounds, they range from really great to hopelessly dated and weak sounding. The UI really doesn't hold up, it's neither functionally well designed nor is it good to look at, it's about as basic barebones minimal effort as can be. Tracks take an unreasonably long time to load, so if you're running on a traditional hard drive you might wanna put your favourite trilogy on while you wait.\n\nIt sounds like a negative review but it's not given what Rfactor 2 is. Rfactor 2 is a simulator for serious driving simulator fans, for people who want a tool for driver training. If you put enough effort into Rfactor 2 to source the best quality content, to optimise your control setup, to work with the car setups and to maximise your experience then you will have a must have driving sim. But if you're looking for an out of the box driving sim experience there are better options out there.","May 19","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
