The title of the game sums it perfectly!\n\nWith it being cheap, rhythum based and Colourful! I thought I'd give it a go. And I'm glad I did.\n\nThe aim of the game is to get from A-B With good timing and paying attention.\nYou Start off with 10 introduction levels. With it gradually getting harder and harder.\n\nPros;\nGreat Colour Scheme\nEasy Tutorial\nMinimal menus and settings/Could be a con but its enough for the type of game.\nFast paced\nChanging levels , not much repetition.\nCons;\nAudio isn't very wide. Sounds very similar and doesn't get much different\nDoesn't work with gamepad, Only minor I know. but it would be fun to play on.\nThe game reminds me of "Entwinded" From the PS4.  with a few other titles. For £1.79 It's worth it, Even though I spent more time dying, and re-trying I didn't get frustrated. I just wanted to finish. And when I did. I was tempted for the next level. Non buggy, simple and fun.\n\n90/100 Worth the price! Having a lot of fun","May 9","true","1.1"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","20","23","2","0"

It is addicting, absolutely frustrating, and insanely rewarding when you actually start completing some of these insane levels.\n\nTurn Left, Turn Right, how hard can that be? Quite.\n\nMy biggest problem I've noticed is planning my moves in advance and my brain betraying me and turning when I am still on a straight path. Harder levels go faster and faster. It gets to the point where you aren't really "thinking" and just react. I'll beat a level and be amazed I completed it as it was like a blur. This is definitely hard and is a specialized type of "fun" that requires a deeper appreciation. The music in this game is fair, but the subtle beat and noises you generate from moving become quite hypnotic at times (really surreal).\n\nI have a hard time understanding how anyone could argue that this isn't worth $3. How many hours of gameplay do you want for that much money? Worst case scenario, this is the game you put on when friends come over and have them have a go at it. Laughing at their pitiful attempts should be priceless.","May 12","true","3.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It got boring quickly, and coupled with the dull music, it didn't keep me interested, and simply annoyed me. The menu's are well made, and it's glitch free, I'll give it that, but the repetitive dullness of it made me unable to stand it for enough time to invalidate the refund.\n\nMy advice to the dev would be to make the music more interesting. For a rhythm based game, it's incredibly important, so having it be this minimal really takes away from it. If it had more to it then I could endure it, as generally I enjoy tough games, but this one is boring.\n\nEDIT!\nThe developer received the criticism very well, and went on to fix several of my criticisms! This game is looking to go in good directions!","May 11","false","5.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"
