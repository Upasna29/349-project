But your angina decay went so slowly you could not be aware at the time.\n\nTime. You had all the time in the world. Time to find any solution to any mind or heartache presented to you. Time to waste. Time to enjoy.\n\nNow you know how precious time is. But even more, you are painfully aware of how precious any pipe-dream solution to get those bits and pieces back are. Because you are still looking for them and your body cells have long since started to decompose more rapidly than they renew, and your hair is thinning and graying like it's a race to the finish line.\n\nToday you live among hipster d0uchebags hating on anything older than an hour of existence, pathetic script kiddies on your lawn leaving snarky internet comments everywhere they go, sold-out parents with their fake smiles and monster mortgage, and everyone generally pretending to enjoy life after the innocence of their childhood went away forever.\n\nAnd however faint your hope, you alone still struggle with the idea that somewhere there has to be a key, a door, or even the tiniest of glimpse, back to those wonderful years. And you would again, just for a brief moment, be able to enjoy a full, red heart behind your now and forever dusty, weathered rib cage.\n\nThis game, then, is my gift to you.\n\nIt's for all of the snowmen and snow castles in life that you wanted to build, but never could because of lack of talent or not winning the gene lottery. It's for all the sled rides that didn't have a deadline connected with them, only the sheer joy of feeling the wind in your hair as you lost your mittens and scarf, going so fast down the hill your parents would have a heart attack if they saw it. And nothing could rival the biggest, burning smile that stemmed from your soul and materialized in full between your ears.\n\nIt's for your kids, to enjoy something else than generic Zombie Killer Survivalz, Call of Modern Warfare Crapsh|t Ultimate Edition 3, or FIFA Overpaid License Game Lawyer Edition.\n\nIt's pure and simple, in the most beautiful of forms. It's for you to take a sneak peak at and play after the kids have gone to bed and you no longer have to pretend to be an adult anymore. It's for you to link back to a better time with. It's for all your hopes and dreams that went away so easily, but were ever so hard to grasp once more, or even replay in your mind.\n\nMarvin's Mittens will grab hold of your wrinkled hand, and inch by snowy inch it will carry you through what you initially thought would be some small panels of hand drawn images, but turning out to be as close to a Winter Holiday with Calvin and Hobbes that you will ever be so lucky to get.\n\nGo and play in the snow. Lose a mitten or two along with your worries. It will mend your silly, old, tired heart and it will make you smile - for real this time.","December 30, 2015","true","18.2"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","29","30","5","2"

It hit me almost immediately: The colours, the sounds, even the isolation. But it's not just for children, and in fact I'd say the incredible sense of nostalgia it engenders makes it more appropriate, and almost certainly more effective, for adults.\n\n"Charming" is probably an overused adjective in game reviews (or at least on the backs of boxes), but if any game deserves to wave that flag, Marvin's Mittens is it. It's not a difficult game, nor is it particularly long, and it's not going to put your platforming skills to the test. But it is an immensely satisfying experience that recreates a childlike sense of wonder and exploration like nothing else I've ever played.","December 20, 2014","true","2.4"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

I don't think I've ever enjoyed a platformer this much in my entire life. The story itself is nothing to write home about; one of Marvin's mittens got stolen and he's looking for it every day. The execution however is top-notch. Everything from the simple but rewarding progression to the music score, voice acting, level design, you name it, were all very well done.\n\nThe only (minor) grip I had with the game was the automatic saving system that got in the way of snowflake-hunting more than once by throwing Marvin back home at more-or-less regular intervals. I think I would've liked a disable option for this but I have to admit that it added its own little charm. Moreover, as traveling from map to map got faster, it didn't really bother me.\n\nOverall, I'd say the experience was worth every cent. Absolutely loved it. I can well imagine myself returning to this game in the future.","January 11","true","7.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

This little jump & run gem is full of joy, nostalgia and heart-warming moments.\n\nSome people may say this is for children only, and I very much disagree. I honestly believe that if you're an adult and can't find enjoyment in playing this, something's wrong with you.\n\nThe game will take you around 4 to 5 hours to complete and yes, I wish it were a bit longer. However, in my opinion it's still worth buying it at full price, and after completing Marvin's Mittens I actually bought the soundtrack to throw more money at the devs.\n\nIf you're looking for a game to get yourself into the winter holidays mood, this one is it.","December 5, 2015","true","5.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

It's not hard and rather short, but everything in this game works exactly as it should, and the amount of heart put into it makes exploring its world a pure joy.\nI haven't seen a better game for spending winter holidays with your kid or going back into childhood yourself.","January 10, 2015","true","4.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The art, music and general ambience make for a delightful couple of hours taking Marvin through the countryside and pushing further and further (with some helpful shortcuts!) before your mom calls you in for the night. I thought the mechanism of playing in 10-15 minute or so spurts would be annoying, but the system is so seamless it doesn't really take away from the game at all.

Just watching the trailer should make you smile. If it does, then you can buy the game and know that you're gonna get more of that.

After that, you will get a very decent platforming game, where you're trying to collect all the snowflakes. There is nothing new, but it's solidly executed, and there is a lot of humors and/or cuteness to discover in Marvin's world.\n\nReaching the ending and then getting all snowflakes should take experimented gamer about 3 to 4h, with gradual difficulty increase.

Before spring comes. Before sun is destroying the charme of this beautiful game. I do not recommend it, playing in summertimes.

It's a game for kids ... and for adults, which have a sentimental memory of their childhood. The graphics beautiful handdrawn, Marvin, the leading character is lovely animated and walks like a child eager to detect nature and his imaginations where mittens and cocoa play a large role.\nThe gameplay is like a jump n'run where ou collect snowflakes to reach a better and higher performance in your jumps; the music fits best to the scenery and is really worth listening - even the save-sleep-rest song, which you hear more often than you like, because after 5-10 minutes of gameplay, Marvin is called by his mother to go to bed (good idea for limiting the playtime for younger ones). Marvin jumps, collects, discovers animals and what the hell is going on with these mittens.\nFor me it was a very nice game experience, where the main gameplay is often loosened by funny ideas: who has detected all the funny things: the dragon, the frozen pirate ship, the rocky flying mitten, the eagle on top of the Taller Mountain and at last even the reindeer?\nVoila, I recommend this game in its whole (besides the limited playtime before going to bed) as a lovely heart-touching one in times where action and power take center in every corner. And if you do not like to drink so much cocoa like Marvin, just try to read the Elfcyclopedia, it's worth it!\n\nPlaytime: 5-6 hours if you want all stars.

If you have children between 6 to 8 years old, this is a perfect platformer for them to get started on.  The graphics, atmosphere, music, and the little bit of writing and dialog that there are, all add up to make a great child's game.\nThere are no bad guys to defeat, no pits of spikes to traverse and no health bar or damage from falling from too high: simply the wonder of discovery as Marvin wanders out of his backyard in search of his stolen mitten.  Along the way, he meets magical elves who aid in his quest.  Marvin occasionally spies small animals, and if he moves slowly, he can whip out his sketchbook and draw a picture of them.\nAfter about ten or fifteen minutes of playing, Mom calls Marvin back to the house for bed at which point she hums a short lullaby and gives the opportunity to save progress and quit.\nThe only con is that the last couple of levels, or screens, have one or two really difficult spots for small kids to handle.  It will probably require an adult or older sibling to get the child to the very end and discover who stole Marvin's mitten.

The backgrounds and levels are wonderfully designed, it has some nice humor and all in all it simply has an enchanting atmosphere about it. What really captures it as well is the voice actor for Marvin, really sounding like an enthusiastic young boy having fun in the snow without ever sounding grating. And while it is rather short it has just the right length to make you feel satisfied without the game seeming like it overstays its welcome.\n\nI'd greatly advice to keep it on your wish list.","November 10, 2015","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are some really great surprise locations as well.  If I had any complaints, it would only be that there isnt more of it (not that there isnt a fair amount to it).  I collected everything and solved the mystery of the missing mittens in under three hours.","December 10, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's also great for adults that are tired of, or dislike, tense, frantic games with maddeningly heavy music and every sort of creature that's lurking with evil thoughts running rampant, all centering around your demise.\n\nDid I mention there's forest critters to find? No, not to stalk, shoot, or eat. You get to be friends with them! What a heartwarming idea that'll inordinately thrill every time one is gently discovered.\n\nThis beautiful romp is through hand-drawn scenes which perfectly capture the innocence and imagination of childhood. Didn't have one of those? Childhood, I mean. Do yourself a favour and buy this. Experience one!","December 5, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Beautifully hand-drawn characters and envoirments with magical music. The game itself is surprisingly deep and involves a lot of things and sceneries to discover, even after completing the game. Some areas requires the extended float jump which only is available after completing the game once which is a plus and rewards curious minds. Takes around 3-5 hours to complete and 100% and is a great game to play during the winter holidays.","December 28, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought this game in December 2014 and played it since then every year in\nDecebmber.\n\nMarvin's Mittens is a jump and run game made with love form the developer.\nThe game principle is very simple.\nEvery day the little Marvin is out in the nature to find his lost mitten.\nAfter one (ingame) day, his mom is calling back home.\nThen he goes to sleep and on the next day it starts again.\nOn his way he will find snowfleeks that help him fly for a short time.\nThe more snowfleeks you collect, the longer you can fly.\nAlso the controls are realy easy to master.\n(I prefer to play with a XBox 360 Controler but I also played it with mouse and keyboard.)\n\nAll in all,\nit has so many nice and heard warming moments that it is worth buying and playing.","January 6","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As silly as it sounds, it's about the magic of the whole experience that really makes you feel like a kid again, staring with awe at the winter world around you.\nSnow everywhere, towering pine trees, luminous caves, mountain peaks, the occasional animal, and even elves!\nI launched steam, opened up the game, put away my phone, put my earbuds in, and forgot about the rest of the world (if only for a couple hours).\nIf you like Calvin and Hobbes, think of all the magical adventures Calvin had out in the snow with his tiger friend and then put that into game form.\nI don't have much else to say. I could never be cynical about something that works this well.\nThis game'll melt your heart with a cup of hot chocolate and then put it to bed.
