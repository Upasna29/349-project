If you want to take longer to win than your base building sessions in Fallout 4, then by all means, pick the other two inferior paths.\n\nI really want to like this game, because it's art style, music and call backs to 80 - 90's martial arts movies makes the game quite charming and enjoyable. It's a tragic shame that four severe factors corrodes this enjoyment:\n\n1.The crippling stat decay system: training or not, your progress will drop by roughly 50 % everyday regardless.  Either the devs never exercised in their lives or they REALLY wanted to add micro payments in their game to mitigate this effect but were deathly afraid of having their small building burned to the ground.\n\n2.Disappointing story for the champion path:  If you wanna play a hero, look elsewhere, because the game will punish you by eventually becoming a commercialized tool instead of a boxer and have a weak as heck ending to top it off. If this was supposed to be a nod to Rocky 3, then they nodded so hard, their nose busted on the counter.\n\n3.RNG: Aside from picking your moves before the fight, you have no control of combat whatsoever, you have to pray to RNGesus that your fighter not only attacks, but follow up with more afterwards and not stare into his opponent's eyes likes he's falling in love.\n\n4.Severe balance issues:  Like I said, if you want the less stressful path possible, then go agility, because having to hit and avoid damage is far more preferrable than taking hits as the RNG system screws you over because your fighter felt like taking hits than giving them, running out of stamina and eventually losing. The more strength you have the more tired you get, as stamina doesn't regenerate as much as it should, unless you have skills that increase your chances as you get up from the floor.\n\nThere is, of course the common complaint of repetiveness of going through your "simmy" routines, but if these four glaring issues were mostly addressed, I would of forgave this.  Unfortunately it only adds to the tedium of this game.\n\nIf you want to buy this game for the call backs and asthetics, I won't stop you, but you've have been warned.","January 23","false","89.6"," 377 of 482 people (78%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","78","377","482","40","11"

The idea of a fighting game RPG has a lot of depth to it - mixing together different skills, changing tactics between rounds, that part of the game was fun, early on at least. The game drags itself out by being a grind fest of spending in game weeks in the gym trying to outpace your stat decay, fights once you hit a certain point are simply click a button and win if you have an Agility build, and the story of the game feels incomplete at the end.\n\nThe game HAD promise, but it has no way to maintain momentum through to the end of the game. And therein lies the main issue: You're constantly fighting against this downward drag the whole game by trying to keep your stats up against the daily decay, that it becomes unbearable and the ending left me utterly dissappointed.\n\nSave yourself the money, watch a playthrough of it first before even considering picking this up.\n\nEdit: Clarified the term "weeks" to in game weeks. The game tracks how many days you spend playing, so activities cost time - At the end of the day, you lose an arbitrary amount of the stats you've built up, so you spend a LOT of time doing nothing but working out, which is unfun.","March 8","false","11.6"," 252 of 355 people (71%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","71","252","355","8","14"

It's hard. It has a high end curve of learning. Especially at the beginning. The game doesn't really points out what are you supposed to do with certain characters or if it's better to work at the pizzeria rather than at the construction, but this means that it is up to the player to find out what is best. Better start to pay attention to the mechanics of the game. The game puts the player in the position to dig and learn about it, rather than showing everything just from the start. Better start another game if you find out that you are losing more stats than gaining, or learning that is better to rotate exercises than just keep doing the same one all over again. Nonetheless, the game does gives you advice and it is up to the player if he wants to really hear them or just keep playing and being "punished" for not listening. For example: there is a point at the start of the game where Frank calls you and tells you to read a little magazine he had when he was young fighter just like you. There, the game mildly tells you that you shouldn't focus in increasing all of your stats, but strive for just one. Thus putting you to embrace only agility, stamina or strength. But also, you shouldn't focus only in increasing your stat, but in learning a new move or skill daily. Yeah, this straightforward advice will be necessary later in the game. So, you should put attention to every detail of advice the game gives you and start recording every info or mechanic you discover because you are on your own to find out how to beat this game. The fun is in the actual play & learn, the funny tidbits and references to pop-culture, and discovering mechanics so that you can improve progressively. After you discover how it works, you'll fly smoothly throught it.","January 9","true","24.1"," 143 of 193 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","143","193","7","2"

In a nutshell, you have to both work to make money and train to raise your physical stats. No matter how much you train, you will always lose some stat progress. ALWAYS. And, you have to work in order to buy food so you don't starve. So, if you spend time making money, that's time you DON'T spend training, so you're not making up for any stat decay you're going to get overnight.\n\nAdditionally, the fights are infuriating. You choose your moves, and then the fight starts and... you watch.  That's it. You watch. You can NOT affect the outcome of the fight while the fight is in progress. So, when your character is getting his ♥♥♥ kicked, you can just sit there and watch him and hope he doesn't get knocked out so you can, if you have them, switch moves in between rounds.\n\nArt is nice. I love well done pixel graphics. Idea is nice. Execution is very poor.\n\nThey really need to do something about the brutal stat decay.","February 22","false","8.7"," 357 of 541 people (66%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","66","357","541","14","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Downpouring/recommended/394310/","Downpouring","Downpouring","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Downpouring/","52 products in account","The game has a ton of potential, and could have been a very entertaining fight club RPG, but doesn't execute it correctly.\n\nPros: 80/90's graphics and sounds, Skill trees are interesting, TMNT and Fight Club references. Also just realized Vincent and Jules are in the Cafe, lol. The fighting is pretty fun, especially when you unlock a new ability.\n\nCons: Attempting to balance your workout schedule and keeping up with your needs gets very tedious, very fast. This would be the perfect game if it weren't for the fact that you have to constantly stop what you're doing to focus on a need like eating or sleeping. Out of food? You need to earn some with Money. Out of Money? You need to spend time at work. Work wearing you out? You need to sleep and lose all of that food you just bought. In the limited spare time you have, workout your skills and watch as they deplete every single day that you have to spend working or sleeping. Oh, and when you finally get the time to save up enough money to purchase your own equipment, you apparently have a high chance of getting stopped by a mugger who will fight you and take half your cash if he wins.\n\nIf you can get over the "Needs" Gameplay and find a balance/schedule that works for you, you'll enjoy this game. Otherwise look elsewhere.\n\nEDIT on 1/10/2016: Continued playing this game switching from my Strength build to a pure Agility build, from what I can see this is probably the easiest way to advance quickly. The devolopers were correct, after you start winning fights you will eventually snowball and money and time is much easier to manage.\n\nI don't want to spoil the storyline, but I reached a certain point where food and sleep was readily available for free, but at that point in the game it became an even more insane grind fest. The point is to train as much as possible while building up a resource that is needed to fight famous fighters. It's fairly easy to earn this resource, but it will still be several hours of pure grinding out your stats (Agility) just to keep up with them. At this point I stopped playing because the grinding got to me.\n\nAfter switching from Strength to Agility, I did enjoy the game because it was much, much easier to win fights and subsequently easier to make money and train/learn new abilities. I still do not recommend this because of the sheer fact that the entire premise of the game is to simply grind one Stat and doing the same thing hour after hour to try to progress slowly just to grind more isn't entertaining. From everything I've seen, Strength and Stamina are extremely difficult to use. My one recommendation I have to developers is to please slightly decrease the amount of training you lose at the end of each day.

You can for example, train hard in order to increase your stats and fight well in the ring, or take "potions" that allow you to shadily improve your stats temporarily.\n\nYou have control over story decisions, as well as gameplay decisions. You need to get enough sleep and eat well, so that you can work, so that you can have enough money to buy more food, and pay entry fees to gyms or buy equipment for your garage.\n\nProgressing in this game feels very rewarding. As you train in fighting, you gain skill points to spend on whatever abilities you want. Depending on what stats you focus on in training, you may enter a different fighting tree, and may want for example, something that inflicts heavy damage, but consumes a lot of energy.\n\nAfter unlocking certain abilities with skill points, at the beginning of each fighting round, you select your line up of abilities you want your character to use within the fight. You don't actually interact while fighting. All you can do is watch.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy the game. It's fun to progress, there are quite a lot of twists in the story and world that keep the game fresh.

While that is not neccesarily a lie or a shady way of representing what the game really is, I personally view is as a casual coach simulation game. You are both the main protagonist's personal trainer when it comes to fitness and training, and coach when it comes to selecting which skills should he use in combat or learn as he improves. It is your task to guide him in his quest to become a world-renowned fighter and discover who killed his father and why.\n\nLet's take a look at the good, the bad, and... the dubious.\n\nThe Good:\n1. The game is extremely atmospheric.\n2. Awesome soundtrack, which is extremely catchy - this is my second favorite catchy tune after the original King's Bounty main theme in the 90's.\n3. Lots of easter eggs hidden throughout the in-game locations, referencing fighting video games, movies and cartoons.\n4. Free DLC - the devs announced a free 3-hour content addition to the game, in which the main protagonist takes a more vigilante-style approach to things. It is good to see that the developers actually care for their clientelle and not try to milk them for cash. had they done the opposite, I would have given them the thumbs down.\n5. Meaningful choices - selecting which path to take (leagues, underground fights, skill trees, being good, breaking bad, etc.) makes for good replayability.\n6. Good price vs gameplay hours ratio - if you want to try all 3 aspects, and with a single run lasting 8+ hours (more with the free dlc in march), you will be looking at a good price/hours played ratio.\n7. On a personal note, the game actually motivated me to do more push-ups and to exercise more than I used to... This must be a good thing, right?\n\nThe Bad:\n\n1. Realism - to say that this game is rather unrealistic is an understatement. From healing a broken arm or leg in 4 days to losing stats every day... please, don't get me started.\n2. The story is like a second grade action movie - it is serviceable, but ultimately subpar.\n3. More of a clicker than a management game - there is a lot of clicking and no management, to put it simply.\n4. Content - the game sorely needs more content, and while more of it is coming next month, I sure hope it finally forces players to leave the mansion rather than just spend hours and hours on end in it.\n5. You can lose fights through no fault of your own - there is no skill-based combat, and you can do little to influence the outcome - you just select a setup and click fight, maybe change it between rounds... and just watch animations while the game does it all in the background. Hence the casual aspect of the game...\n6. The dialogue is non-existent - you will be going through the very same lines over and over till your head explodes.\n7. The learning curve in the game is quite high - mainly because the game does a poor job at giving you precise info what some skills do, or how the training device impacts the stats. While the bubbles are cute to watch fly up and fill in bars, I would have enjoyed a (+X) option...\n\nThe Dubious - is it good or bad? It's a matter of perspective, sir!\n\n1. Skill tree balance - the people who shout that Agility and Way of the Tiger is OP, are not wrong... but also not necessarily right. The skills that make Agility/Tiger good are rather far down the line and until then, you will get your butt kicked a lot. I personally found that Stamina/Turtle suited me better, netting me 98% win ratio in a sub-100 day victory without much trouble, unlike agility/tiger which caused me tons of early game aggravation. EDIT: I take back my original conclusion. Turtle is the easiest if played properly, tiger is the second, as it tis so easy to win even if you blunder big time and bear is the hardest. Why? Read my guide - just click the guides section. Enough said!\n2. The game cannot be lost - it just turns into an even bigger grind if you do poorly. As you progress through the leagues, so do your opponents. If you are doing poorly, muddling your way through, their league scores will rise and it will take you even more time to overcome them. Your guy won't give up - but you might...\n3. Random 2 skills at start - I would have enjoyed the ability to pick which 2 skills I get to start with. You may want to go tiger and get a punch and a block, instead of the dodge you need, making progression more grindy later down the line.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI am going to give this game a careful recommendation. It is certainly not a bad game, and it has a good concept, backed by free dlc coming our way, which to me shows that the developrs care about their customers. It is also certainly not a cashgrab. I also found myself wanting to push the values as high up as possible and had my share of enjoyment doing so. The fact that it is a casual game did not stop me, as I could easily enjoy it while doing other stuff. I was also very entertained by the various easter eggs, as every location has at least one. On the negative side, if you want a real fighter management game, if you dislike having no control over the combat, or if you found the bad sides of the game I listed overwhelming, I would totally stay away from it.","February 27","true","40.6"," 117 of 167 people (70%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","70","117","167","7","11"

The game gives us NO reason to feel upset about our friend dying. There is barely any dialouge in this game, and I get that it's a tycoon game, but seriously? If one of the main driving points for the whole second part of the plot is your friend dying, I SHOULD FEEL SOMETHING FOR HIM! Not just like, "Oh, yeah, he's dead..."\n\nFor the finale there is really no way to not do spoilers...but seriously time travel? Out of all the nonsensical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you chose  time travel? I get it, this game is meant to be kind of funny, but when we have ABSOLUTLEY NO BUILD UP and NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT how am I supposed to react to this? Oh that's cute,  ♥♥♥♥ing time travel, well I guess that's one way to end the damn story. And then on top of that they pull some Luke, I am your father ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. For those who don't believe me or didn't understand the ending themselves I watched the end dialouge three freakin' times (Because it moved too fast the first time for me to catch it and actually believe what I was reading.)\n\n...I hope you're all intised to look at the spoilered information.\n\n2)Gameplay wise once you beat the tourney and become pro the game goes downhill and just feels like a grind. This is because everything is handed to you. Food, daily income, a private gym...I guess it kind of reflects reality accuratley about once a person comes into money but gameplay wise it is an absolute bore.\n\n...the one thing I liked about the ending was the nod to the stupid 80/90's? mortal kombat movie.\n\nPROS:1a) Enjoy fight club glory and get revenge on your fathers murder! I like how quests are introduced in this game, it isn't straight forward and forces you to explore and there's a hint of randomness to it.\n\n1b) Because of the story and randomness of events, it helps the tycoon parts not feel repetitive\n\n1c) TMNT reference. There's turtle shells in the masters dojo (Too bad his name ain't Splinter) BUT! Did anyone notice that the PIZZA delivery man is named Casey? CASEY JOOOONNNNESSSS...or does no one like him? And the alligators but that's a give away.\n\n2) Difficulty curve......due to things I would consider CONS...but once you get over it there's a tiny treasure chest filled with blood, sweat, tears, maybe money if you've truly mastered it, and accomplishment at the end of the rainbow.\n\n3) Getting your ♥♥♥ pummeled in the first round? Don't worry! Change up your fighting style and show 'em who's boss!\n\n4) Multiple ways to tackle your schedule: Either earn cash and work at the gym or earn cash aaaaaaaaaaannnnn-----\n\nCONS:1a) ....honestly, screw trying to earn cash until later: So you earn enough cash to build a gym or buy food or do anything OTHER than train and you get robbed. Sure, hold it off until later, but you need food to get through the day.\n\n1b) Think you can escape the robbers on bus? WRONG!!! Apparently bus takes a wrong turn or it's a set-up because all of a sudden your fighting robbers and in the bottom right of the map\n\n2a) Happiness though...seriously. In my first play around this meter sucks. There are a few things you can spend money on to increase happiness at the start, but otherwise you have to sit on your ♥♥♥ in front of the TV the entire day (Seriously, this bar goes up way too slow, you think I could find something to watch that would make the damn guy happy. Put some damn porn in your VHS player or something you sad ♥♥♥♥)\n\n2b) BTW earning cash at any of the jobs sucks too for the same reason. Welcome to the biggest waste of your hunger, energy, and good ol' happiness meter!\n\n3) Meat is the only food to go with at the start of the game (Fills half your hunger meter). Everything else is a waste of money, especially gym food, don't do it unless you really need to finish up in the gym...\n\n4) The beginning fights take way too long. It takes maybe 10 seconds for you to realise who's going to win the round (I've only had a handful of upsets). The multiple rounds are nice, but there's no KOing...even if you're both just staring at each others damn faces waiting for enough lighting bolts to ping off your head for the next attack...and even if you have seventy energy still left. Once you get over the NPCs strength curve the fights tend to go by pretty quickly.\n\n5a) The skill tree was cool at first, but then it boils down to stacking skills > unique skills.\n\n5b) It's a kinda joke nostalgic tycoon fight club game. If you're going to throw in a TMNT reference why not any throwbacks to classic fighting game moves just to be silly? Some sort of mid game (For balance reasons?) special dojo or something.\n\n5c) Stats, which will be sadly ranted about in a second, are another thing that hold you back from truly exploring the skill tree fully too (BUT THAT'S WHAT THE THREE SAVE FILES ARE FOR!!! DUHHHHHH!!!) because you can't unlock certain skills without a certain level in the stat, which you can level up later once your main is leveled higher. Shouldn't be too har-- BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!!!\n\n6a) I saved everyone's biggest grievance for last! At the end of EVERY DAY you lose points in all stats.\n~From a developer needing to balance the game standpoint I see how this makes sense. Players could quickly and easilly get their stats to the max and just buzz through the fights\n~From a player standpoint I can see that this is annoying and needs to be worked with\n~From a runners standpoint it makes no ♥♥♥♥ing sense! When you train, your body doesn't ♥♥♥♥ out on you the day after. I'm never like, "I'm going to run 8 miles today!" and then tomorrow comes around and all, "♥♥♥♥ HOW DO LEGS MOVE".\nI get it, if you could train all your stats and they'd stay you'd be AWP but this doesn't happen in real life, people do that damn crossfit crap. Personally, I knew people on Track/XC who could run a 1:58 800m and kickass in a 3k AND bench near 300 lbs.\n\n6b) So, maybe there could have been a different way of balancing stats. Multiple days passing with not training a stat enough points based on your level, doing nothing for 2 or more days straight, just eating ♥♥♥♥ING PIZZA! (The character even says that it'd be bad for him!) Or, maybe just have put stat caps on equipment. Or, make it so after a certain amount of days pass you fail a certain quest...\n\n\nI didn't know where I stood on this game honestly at first. I was really excited for it and was waiting for this to come out. This wasn't just some "ooooo, what's this game?" purchase. Because of that, I sat here overjoyed playing it for a good hour...and then it just kinda sunk in and that faded. What it honestly boils down to is that even though there's all this stuff to react with in the world, everyone's forced down the same set of paths at the beginning...the easiest being deal with the gym and try not to get robbed and MAYBE buy one or two things of equipment for your garage.\n\nTo say this game HAD potential is too harsh, but to say its FANTASTIC isn't really sitting well with me either...\nIf I had to rate this game, I'd give it a Piston Honda out a' Mr. Sandman...........\n.......................like a C-","January 10","false","4.2"," 94 of 147 people (64%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","64","94","147","12","2"

Anyway, the fights take way way way way way too long, especially because 75% of the time you know who is going to win the fight just by looking at the pre-match tale of the tape. Of the remaining 25%, 20% of the time you'll know who is going to win in the first 10 seconds. That leaves about 5% where the fight would actually be worth watching. Otherwise, these fights will drag on and on for 2-3 minutes where you already know what's going to happen.\n\nI chose the agility route and I don't see how there is any benefit to it over something like strength. I do less damage and I can uh, dodge a lot but the game still plays out exactly the same every time. Each character attacks once. Then someone attacks twice. Then the other person attacks twice. Then the other. Even with my 7 agility, my opponent with 3 agility attacks just as often but does more damage because they have a higher strength stat than me, haha. So you might as well pour all the points in strength and block. And yes, i did fill out the stats tree correctly and went Tiger route.\n\nFight difficulty is so random. At rank 9 I will fight someone with stats along the line of 2/2/3 and at rank 6 the opponent will be 3/5/5 and then at rank 5 I'll fight someone 1/3/2. I also was able to beat the hell out of an aligator with twice as much HP as me and way better stats but got crushed by a weed loving idiot with worse stats.\n\nThere needs to be some food variety. Meat/Pizza/Soda/Energy Drink/Chocolate/Protein Bar. Oh and you can find a rotting burger. It also is ridiculous that you can get a broken leg and be unable to work at full capacity for 4 weeks but hell you can get in the ring and fight like there's no problem at all!\n\nI play a lot of Kairosoft games so I get the appeal of this type of game. It is NOT a bad game, but I gave it a "no" for do you recommend it because after two hours of playing it is seems like one of those 1.0 type games that is just missing a lot. I'll likely come back to it in a few months and see if they added anything else to it but as it stands right now I think I'll just log on and see if I can OD my character on steroids.","January 8","false","3.5"," 310 of 519 people (60%) found this review helpful 49 people found this review funny","60","310","519","49","8"

There has to be a better way of implementing this. I understand that the devs don't want you to simply max out your stats but it would be better to limit this rather than making you work over and over for the same stats.\n\nEvery time I quit this game I feel like I've wasted my life. There's some strategy to it in how you select abilities when you level up but the training and grinding gets old very quickly.\n\nIf you like mindless grinding, you'll probably like this.

Probably I didn't go down the story route the devs have intended (I went full "I wanna be the very best, like no one ever wa...", eh, you get the deal), but what I encountered was pretty much a punch in the face: this route ends with probably one of the worst "what exactly was that?"-endings in video game history, so kudos I guess.\n\nTo give you a better idea: you remember those old NES games that seemingly were just produced for the sole purpose of punishing you, yet still were so good that you wanted to push through them? Those, that ended up with a simple "Congratulations! You saved the world!"-text screen and returned to the main menu?\n\nWell, Punch Club is one of those, only in "very mediocre"-mode after hour 2. It's the very definition of a game that could have been much better - the qualities shine through - but leaves the bitter taste of a sudden creativity block dev wise after a certain point.\n\nIt's funny, it has awesome pixel art and the music is catchy, but it lacks substance - a lack of substance the promise of an interesting story tries to make up for without ever delivering. I'm not mad that I paid 10€ for it, since this product clearly had a lot of love poured into it (which I absolutely admire), but as a game, I cannot recommend it.","February 5","false","8.6"," 77 of 119 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","77","119","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/394310/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1507 products in account","Punch Club is a retro boxing management game that brought attention to itself by an unusual Steam release model.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\n20 minutes of my Punch Club gameplay:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J99wBpSE3IU\n\nWhat is happening in the game:I'll let myself kidnap this section of my review for a brief explanation of how this game was launched. You could preorder the game on Steam for -20% and the preorder would last until the Twitch community wouldn't beat the game on the ongoing live stream. They would make each in-game decision by voting in the chat and the most voted option would be executed. Twitch viewers have already beaten the game now, so this game is ready to be played.\nIn the game, you play as a boxer whose dad died of violent death. You have to train yourself to become better and better, win matches, do jobs, eat, help other people and plenty of other stuff. You progress in the storyline by completing missions.\n\nPros:    Graphics | I love 'em. That's not the case with most retro-looking games, but I definitely love the way Punch Club looks. Colours are well-chosen and the animations are made well, too. The resolutions and the fullscreen/windowed mode work as expected.\nMissions | I really like how the whole game progress consists of separate missions. You still get to train yourself, fight and do usual stuff, but to really keep going, you have to complete missions. I have to say that most of the missions are done well, meaning that there are no really hard ones or if there are, you have other easier missions to complete at the same time. Another thing I really like is that you get an achievement for every single missions you complete, bringing additional enjoyment and stimulation to the whole experience.\nThe Soundtrack | The soundtrack also follows the retro style of the game and they managed to make some pretty good tracks. As it should, it fits the gameplay and the way the game looks. If you're into it, you can buy the DLC containing both the OST and the artbook. Get it here.\nTraining System | It's almost like in real life, just a bit faster: you get slightly weaker every day, if you don't train enough. This prevents someone from just farming money from jobs or something like that, but forces the player to play a balanced game and worry about multiple things at once.\nThe Story | For a boxing management game, I have to say that I'm impressed with the story setup. Punch Club begins with a cutscene and it continues throughout the whole game. Heck, it even has multiple endings! I bet you didn't see that coming.\nSteam Integration and OSs | You can train your boxing hero on Windows, SteamOS and MacOS. You also get tons of achievements and Trading Cards. There is also Steam Cloud support.\nCons:    Slight Repetitiveness | You have to train yourself. The way to do this is pretty much the same all the time. Combined with an excellent story, it's not so bad, though.\nGym Entry Price | You have to pay 10$ each day to go to the gym. To afford that, you have to save on food sometimes. However, there is a way of getting free food in the game, which makes things a bit easier.\nThe final verdict:This is a charming retro management with a surprisingly good story and really nice graphics. The gameplay is simple and I fell in love with it. It is assumed that is has around 15-20 hours of gameplay time and for a price of 10$, I think the purchase is worth your money. If you can't afford that, definitely consider getting this game as soon as it gets discounted.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.\n---\nNo drama, Just Reviews.","January 8","true","6.5"," 96 of 153 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","96","153","6","3"

Moving around the map takes either TIME or MONEY.\nMONEY is used to buy food to keep you full enough to keep working out, as well as buying gym access and gym equipment later in the game.\n\nTIME is what you consume by working out, traveling by foot, sleeping, or watching TV.\n\nHowever at the end of each day, you lose a portion of your stats.  So you need to balance working out, working for money, resting, and above all FIGHTING.  (Fighting gets skill points, skill-points give new attacks.)\n\nHowever don't expect much control in combat.  You select which moves you'll be using in combat, then your character auto-fights for that round, then you reassign (or keep) moves.\nThat's it.\n\nHowever you will have to pick a focus, no one can easily stay fit in Strength, Agility, and Stamina.  So you'll probably end up focusing one and putting some in a second.\n\nTo Summarize each of the three main stats.\nStrength - You hit hard, and often, but have no defense.\nAgility - You have very complex moves that debuff your opposition and you dodge more than you block, hopefully you dodge more than you get hit by too; also you counter attack every dodge.\nStamina - You have an insane amount of health, block everything, are a virtual tank on legs, and once the enemy is tired and your stamina is full you can take them out with.  *ah-ahem*  WAN PAWWWWWWWWWWWWNCH!\n\nBuy if you like management games, look up gameplay on Youtube if you're still unsure.","January 19","true","2.9"," 61 of 95 people (64%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","64","61","95","9","0"

Early game is rough especially with robbers using their heightened senses to rob you if you ever have an amount of over 150(?). But you'll get past that point "eventually..." I don't like the fact that you can't become well versed in all attributes kind of like a "balanced boxer," you are pretty much forced to go one attribute. Then you just have to train your boxer really hard in AGI, since its the only viable method to getting far, because Strength tires out fast and gets destroyed and stamina is decent, but you'll find yourself missing or hurting yourself with every punch you take.\n\nAnyways, back on topic the game is basically this; you grind, grind some more, and when you get deeper into the game you grind even harder.\n\nWith several changes and fixes I could see this game being very enjoyable, but in the meantime it's literally just an unrewarding challenge, might as well go workout in real life where gains don't disappear so fast.\nI rate 6/10\n\nUPDATE:\n\nOne more thing I like to add is, after beating the game I was heavily disappointed you couldn't do anything else. I was excited since I invested a lot of time into my guy and then BAM, there's no extra objectives or more awesome fights, just one lackluster ending. I spent a lot of time training my character so he could fight and win so I would expect fights. But after beating the last guy it just ends, that's it, nothing more, like what... Very disappointing that there's no extra tournament, no survival (fight till you can't...), no defending your title, nothing. The replay value is extremely low due to grinding and there's no enjoyment to all that time training later in the game since it ends so fast. And the ending was pretty much crap and made little sense.\n\nChanges I would like to see added:\n\n- More fights, tournaments, title defense or something to spice up end game, because I mean you did all that training for it to amount to one fight and then its THE END, no enjoyment for your awesome character.\n\n- More interactions, the one thing I felt this game did good at was the atmosphere, there were people to talk to and things to explore and unlock, just very little and I would like to see more added. It would be awesome if there were an extra map or more places added and more fighters/npc's. I mean you had BRUCE MIGHTY, where's Buck Norris (Chuck Norris BTW)? Why not add a gang's hideout or Don's faction so you can have more cool fights or optional things to do besides the daily grind.\n\n- EASY/NORMAL/HARD mode, easy would be very low stat decay and starts with food and money etc. etc. Hard would have high stat decay and other restrictions, etc. etc.","January 10","false","20.7"," 41 of 61 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","41","61","0","0"

Picking this up, you will struggle because the time management aspect is not easy, and there are different ways to go about doing it.\n\nThe fights are interesting and very challenging, lots of variation within the three different basic styles, a good amount of strategy and lots of combos.\n\nI highly recommend this game, extremely good for the price.","January 13","true","26.0"," 46 of 71 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","46","71","0","0"

Throughout the game you meet various people, gain new equipment, fight a Teenage Mutant Ninja Alligator Crocodile, get a girlfriend, make difficult decisions, and maybe learn about your father's killer. You can train your guy to be like Mike Tyson and knockout your opponents in just a few hits, or make him like Bruce Lee and do some amazing kicks, or become a boxer that can't be easily knocked down.\nOverall this is actually a very entertaining management game that I can just waste hours on. With various ways to build your character, discovering multiple routes throughout the story, and some very nice pixel art (and there is also a option for a retro mode), I can guarantee that you can also get as addicted as I did.\n\nFinal Rating:  Get ready to eat lightning, and crap thunder!","January 8","true","5.5"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","74","25","34","6","1"

You'd think the combat system would let you put in a decent amount of input during battles, but your wrong. You select what moves you want your guy to use and then you watch the computer fight against itself. Sometimes your guy blocks, other times he doesn't. Sometimes he throws a punch.

Right now, unfortunately, the stat decay is way too sharp and there's a lot of weird design decisions.  If you are ever carrying too much money ("too much" defined as enough to buy gym equipment to escape the never-ending "small jobs for gym fees" loop), there's an extremely high chance that you will be mugged.  That's fine.  That's an additional mechanism that adds some challenge to the game, and makes buying your way into independence feel like a big thing. I have no problem with the concept behind that.\n\nI do have a problem with the decision to make the mugger one of the most powerful enemies in the game, especially considering that money-making activities are uniformly bad for stats.  You're basically adding a big sad clown trumpet sound to the end of the long grind for gym equipment, and if you're going to do that, why even have gym equipment in the game?\n\nThat's just one of a whole bunch of questionable decisions this game has made.  The economy seems all out of whack.  There aren't enough ways to make money that aren't gigantic opportunity cost sinks.  Life sim games are all about management of meters and opportunity costs, and somewhere along the line the developers of this game forgot to check something in their flowcharts and now this game is a horrible unforgiving grind.

Punch Club is undeniably an addictive game and I liked the different paths and choices you could make in your fighting style. But, I did feel like a slave to the game at times just because of the sheer grinding you had to do in order to keep your fighter's stats consistently at a high level. The stat decay is brutal and I don't feel the developer should remove it altogether but at least reduce it by 50% because without that the game becomes a chore.\n\nI've seen a lot of people saying the path of the Tiger is king and at first glance it does seem a little overpowered but I chose the path of the bear and I was a powerhouse that could end fights in the first round if the random number generator felt generous, which goes on to my next point.\n\nThe majority of Punch Club is about luck to be honest, I fought opponents that I shouldn't of been able to beat who had way higher stats than me but thanks to me getting lucky at times and getting maybe 4 or 5 hits in succession I won. I know this is a management tycoon game but I really didn't like feeling powerless in some of the fights and I much prefer to take an active role and actually control the player, but that's just me.\n\nWhile I had fun at times, I wouldn't reccomend this game as it stands, simply because the training becomes very monotonous and I was pretty relieved when I had finished the game in all honesty.","May 22","false","11.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

You start losing fights but it isn't clear why. All three of my stats are higher than the enemy, so why did I lose the fight? Why does their fighter lay out three or four blows when my fighter only does one? Is a fighter with a 2-3-2 build better than one with 1-4-1? If a move is 'agility dependent', does it also rely on strength to do damage?\n\nAs an aside, several of the abilities don't seem to work.\n\nSimilarly, it is easy for the player to fall into problems with the day-to-day life things. For example, not having enough money to buy food, but not having enough energy/hunger to earn money - and all the while, the player's fighter is getting worse due to the ridiculous stat degredation (which appears to be about half of your stats each day). This means the player gets trapped in what basically amounts to a depression spiral where it becomes harder and harder to return to where they were if they fall behind. A slow recovery could be fine, providing your stats weren't degrading because in a game like this not progressing is bad enough. Stat degradation would be fine, if you weren't going to risk losing everything you've worked on if a fight goes bad due to the RNG.\n\nAs an aside, the music is pretty good and the art is nice. The writing is a bit so-so. But the base mechanics can be such a hassle that it is hard to recommend this game.\n\n","February 18","false","11.5"," 106 of 182 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","106","182","5","2"

This game is VERY grind intensive and you do not actually participate in combat.  Basically, when you enter a fight, you have a set number of skill slots where you assign skills that your character will randomly use throughout combat.  There are attack, defense, and passive skills that you can assign, such as kicks and punches or counters.  The game has a heavy handed amount of strategy that's kind of dumbed down by the fact that it's still random and based on stats more than user skill.\n\nAs far as the grind intensity, well, you get to train your character.  And that's great, except you lose stat exp each day as well, so it's a constant uphill battle, what with having to juggle that, food, sleep, money, and so on.  That said, it's damn addictive.  For me, this is especially true because I'm a bit of a gym rat and have contemplated joining an amateur boxing club.  Here are a couple of tips to help you get started with this game:\n\n- Focus on agility first, then stamina.  Strength is a "nice to have," if only because you will eventually encounter enemies with rock hard defenses.  Without high agility, you will miss constantly and barely ever dodge incoming strikes.  Without stamina, you will constantly get knocked down and not have enough energy to pull off even the most basic moves.\n\n- Plan out the skill tree entirely.  Don't waste time getting a bunch of abilities you won't use because each time you get a skill, it costs more to get the next one, regardless which skill you intend to get.  As an added hint, the "do nothing" skill is way more helpful than it sounds as it will result in lots of energy regeneration mid-combat.\n\n- Take the bus when you're able.  Early in the game you'll be poor as hell, but as the game progresses, using the bus will be key to time management.\n\n- Don't hold onto money early in the game.  Unless you're saving up for gym equipment, spend it immediately, otherwise you will get accosted by muggers you can't hope to win against.\n\nThere are many other hints I could provide, but I don't want to spoil the game too much.  It really is fun, but it's not really a fighting game and prepare for a major grind if you do decide to buy it.","January 13","true","39.4"," 29 of 43 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","29","43","0","0"

That's not to say it's a perfect game but this game is undoubtedly one of the more management games I've ever played. Not to mention, this game has some of the best pop culture references I've seen in a while, so many familiar faces! However, before I give my opinion, allow me to explain how the game works.\n\nIn Punch Club, you take on the role of a fighter who's father was murdered by a mysterious red eyed, fedora toting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who brings a gun to a fist fight. You will have to manage 3 main attributes which are STR (strength), AGI (Agility), and STA (Stamina). You increase these stats by training in the gym and use them to defeat opponents in fights. STR affects damage output but increases energy consumption. AGI increases your accuracy and your ability to dodge. STA affects how much energy you regenerate during the fight and at the end of each round. Each stat obviously has it's benefits but it's in your best interest to only focus on one or two, not all three. Having a well-balanced fighter is a bad thing when fighting specialized fighters.\n\nYou will also have to manage your health, hunger, sleep and mood. At first, it'll be tough to have enough money to eat yet still train so that you can compete against tougher fighters. My best advice to you is to work about 2 shifts, eat, sleep and train as much as you can before rinsing and repeating. Eventually, you'll get involved in ultimate fights which start to pay the bills and when you're finally able to beat the 'Rookie League,' you'll really start making money. Oh, you also go to Russia but that's all I'll say about that.\n\nThe largest focus of the game is the fights. Now this game is strange in the sense that it decided to take direct fighting control away from the player and instead base it on the aforementioned stats and seemingly unforgiving RNG mechanics. While this can be annoying, it's also led to some real nailbiters. It should also be noted that there are 3 fighting styles that can be unlocked as your character obtains Skill Points (SP). Along with these fighting styles, you'll unlock skills and perks that are used in combat. All of these skills are activated during combat automatically based on the amount of energy you have and perks are always active in a passive manner.\n\nSo what is my actual opinion of the game? Well, to be honest, I love it. It's a blast. It's annoying as hell but it's still a lot of fun and has a metric ton of charm. Sometimes the game is unbearably grindy like when I was trying to beat the Rookie League but then it suddenly gets super easy once get to Russia. Sometimes the fights feel like total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t when your character is significantly better than another fighter but he somehow gets lucky. Even with these issues, would I recommend it? For 10 bucks? Hell yeah, this is a game that everyone should experience. Especially fans of movies from the 80's and early 90's!\n\nDefinitely recommended.\n\nGameplay and Basics Overview:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtIusSirpn4","January 25","true","6.3"," 28 of 42 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","28","42","4","0"

Train your hero - build stats, collect perks & special moves through series of decisions day to day to achieve an effective profile. From the food he consumes, to the means of getting money for a new training device, friendship with useful people in town and so on - everything will change the overall experience. The game's full of grotesque humor and still rather hard emotionally, for you'll come across different random situations aimed to exhaust your nerves both during the battles & in the civic life.\n\nThe fighting process is fully automatic, just like in 'Football Manager' series where you have control only over the general setup before the round, then you just find yourself yelling at the screen: 'C'mon, you can do it! Look, he's loosing energy fast! You'll get your chance, just hold on there! Don't you dare to fall, you hear me?!' - like a real coach by the ring, unable to even pause the action. The greatest thing about it - the techniques choice is very strategic & you really can counter and get your chance to win even against most dreadful of enemies of different fighting skills. To my mind this is an almost perfectly balanced masterpiece and a must-play for any manager nerd who ever wondered about what for do those bulky guys gather in the local gym every night? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\n------------------\nДань уважения 80ым в игре с точечной графикой от маленькой русской команды, до того подвизавшейся на браузерных строительных симуляторах, и здесь также стратегия с управлением ресурсами, которую умело совместили с гибким интерактивным сюжетом о карьере начинающего борцухи. Тренируйте своего героя - качайте параметры, собирайте особенные черты и спецприемы, принимая повседневные решения, выстраивая эффективный профиль. Начиная с продуктов питания, до способов заработка на новый тренажер, дружбы с полезными людьми в городе - все будет оказывать влияние на игровой опыт. Игра полна гротескного юмора, и в то же время эмоционально тяжела, так как вы будете попадать во множество случайных ситуаций, нацеленных пощекотать вам нервы как в боевой практике, так и в гражданской жизни.\n\nПроцесс сражения полностью автоматический, точно как в серии "Управляющий ногамяча", где контролируешь лишь подготовительную фазу перед раундом, затем обнаруживашь себя вопящим в монитор: "Давай, ты сможешь! Смотри, как быстро он расходует энергию! Жди своего шанса, только держись! Не смей падать, ты слышишь меня?!" - как настоящий тренер у ринга, наспособный даже прерывать происходящее. Самое прекрасное то, что выбор приемов весьма стратегичен, и есть возможность противопоставить что-то и добиться шанса на победу даже во встрече с наиболее пугающими врагами разных бойцовых школ. На мой взгляд, это почти идеально сбалансированный шедевр, который обязателен к ознакомлению каждому заучке-управленцу, недоумевюшему по поводу того, с какой целью все эти здоровые ребята собираются темными вечерами в местной качалке?

Except in Punch Club, there's a written story to follow, and an ending to the game.  Much like Game Dev Tycoon, you'll be micro managing a variety of skills until you're the champ.\n\nAs a tycoon game, Punch Club has a variety of stats and meters to maintain. The most interesting ones being the combat stats of agility, strength, and endurance. What makes these interesting is the fact that they degrade over time, forcing the player to keep up their training routine in order to have their stats at a desired level. Your routine will usually consist of eating, sleeping, training, working, shopping, and fighting.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCxeLRQ32iE\nBuilding your character comes down to what kind of fighter you wish to be. A fast, and accurate jabber? A slow but heavy haymaker? Or purhapes a tanky turtler. It's best to chose one of the 3 conventional builds, as trying to be a jack of all trades will often lead to a failed character. The game's development system can be punishing. If you don't train properly, or don't pay attention to the skill tree, it'll be expensive to fix any errors, as every skill will cost more, the more you invest.\n\nCombat plays out automatically, but allows the player to build a combat "deck" from skills attained through the skill tree. Between rounds the player can change up their skills as needed.\n\nTo say the least, the game certainly has a lot of depth for the player to dive into, but remains accessible enough, that even new comers to the genre could probably get a handle of pretty quickly.\n\nThe presentation of the game is detailed with well illustrated pixel art, and filled with nostalgia, referances, and easter eggs.\n\nThere's a lot to like about Punch Club, the retro aesthetics, the pop culture referances, the depth of the micro-managment, and it's addictive value, but the game is not perfect. I feel like the biggest flaw with the game is easily the repetition. Once you find a comfortable routine that works for you, you'll be sticking to it for the majority of the game, with only rare mini-quests to break up the action. The combat is also unskippable which gets annoying after a little while, especailly considering that the combat is completely automated. Why not give the player the option to skip the the end round results?

Someone put a lot of work into this game and you can tell. That being said personally I wouldn't recommend the game in its current state. The basic framework is there but the numbers and balance keep it from being fun.\n\nMain Gripes:\n\n-There are three stats and you only really pump one (later a secondary but not even close to the level of your primary). Agility is the best stat and there is no real reason to delve into the other two trees. For some reason this stat affects both Hit Chance (this is the most important) and Dodge making you a offensive and defensive threat. Dodge later also becomes a damage dealer from counter-attacks. Most importantly though making this stat the only way to get Hit Chance was a mistake. You can pump the other two stats but if you don't have points into Agility you will lose every fight later on. You won't be able to hit anything and just straight up lose to fighters "weaker" than you. It's too good.\n\n-Ok so this is the issue I think most people have with the game. So the idea is you have to balance your work, needs (eating, sleeping, etc), and training. Every day that passes your stats decay so you have to keep training to keep them up. Early on it sucks but is alright but later the decay is so huge it feels like you artificially spend a lot of time training to deal with the decay. I'm not saying it is not manageable but it is pain dealing with it and later all you do is train to deal with the decay. After the first spurt of the game all I felt like was that I was playing against the decay and was being punished for wanting to play. It didn't feel fun.\n\n-I kind of wish there was a way to skip the dialogue/cut scenes. It takes a while.\n\nThis game is so close to something I would have immensely enjoyed.

When you grind money you have to use bus or you get aggroed by thugs and lose half the money...\nBut when you use bus, and you get aggroed, you can't win because you spent all your time grinding money and your fighting skills are very low.

Sorry I couldn’t get to it fast enough Tiny Build!\nPros:A unique and well-done aesthetic that really harkens back to the old epic 80s flair.\nThe game’s slow growth towards building your character in-game is really interesting.\nWhile cheesy, the story and it’s flair is certainly entertaining.\nThe game’s branching paths make for a lot more of a lengthy game.\nIt’s systems are well-thought out and well-designed to reward the player for planning out their schedule.\nNitpicks:The game’s RNG is incredibly frustrating. It highly prioritizes certain stats over others and can prevent unique builds in the game.\nThe Music is pretty good, but it got repetitive after awhile\nI feel like the game seems to be a much better experience on mobile, versus on PC. It falls in the trap of not being fun to play in long-bursts.\nCons:The game is incredibly repetitious. It’s fine that it reflects the slow growth of becoming a strong fighter, but it’s annoying to repeat the same actions over and over.\nThe combat completely relies on abstractions and virtually zero skill. It’s not fun, and it’s frustrating.\nThe UI was clearly built for mobile, and on PC, it takes way too many clicks to do certain actions.\nThe Review\nI really wish that Steam Reviews had a “Neutral” option. Because while I really do like this game in a lot of aspects, I found it hard to enjoy it in many others.\n\nPunch Club is a really difficult game to discuss about, because what it does is so different. That’s what I like about it, however.\n\nLet’s start off with what’s great. The game’s aesthetic and visuals are really well-done. They’re ripe with detail, and full of color. That’s really all I can say on it.\n\nThe game’s concept is also really cool. Basically, take one of those epic training montages and make it an entire game, and you get this. Punch Club doesn’t shy away from its inspirations and ideas, and goes full throttle on it. And this leads to a unique game that’s immensely fun to play in short bursts.\n\nBut the short bursts is where the game’s main issue lies. I can’t bring myself to play the game for more than maybe 10 minutes, and really couldn’t bring myself to play through the game. That was, until I later got the iOS version of the game, and I was able to enjoy it much more.\n\nYou see, despite its intentions with features such as Twitch integration, Punch Club really feels like a game built for mobile. There’s no microtransactions (Which is superb!), but the game, from it’s UI, to its very design, was most likely built from the ground up.\n\nI can vouch for the fact that it’s a mobile game because the game’s mechanics are designed to have a lot of stopping points; the game has a calendar/time system where you need to create and follow a strong schedule to keep your character up to shape while he’s able to afford food and advance on his quest. How you manage this schedule will arguably affect the chance you have of winning the game’s battles.\n\nAnd it doesn’t help that the UI seems to be entirely built for mobile as well. It’s unacceptable that on PC, I have to constantly click on a ton of buttons to get actions working. From what I’m aware of, the game has no keybind shortcuts, so you have to leave so much of your actions to moving your cursor around and clicking buttons.\n\nWhile managing your schedule and building your character is really, really fun (in small bursts), the combat sort of leaves you to the fate of a number roll to determine your victory. It emphasizes training because you want your character to be stronger so he has a higher chance of getting that lucky win roll, but I feel like without that much input (other than deciding his moves during battle), battles slowly change from really tense fights, to really boring and long matches. The game’s fights will really put a lot of people off, since you really have no direct control over winning the battles.\n\nThat said, while I have a lot of gripes with the game, I don’t think the entire design of the game is bad. For something that could had been just a simulator, they did a outstanding job creating a story that weaves with the game mechanics, and they definitely put a lot of thought in the game’s mechanics and the connection they share.\n\nThe game provides a huge payoff to those who can get through it, and that’s what I like about it. Versus (the literal bane of my existence) Knights of Pen and Paper, the game understands how much work the player has to put into getting a solid character going, and rewards the player with satisfying victories and tons of paths down the game’s narrative.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn’t find the game to click for me. What kept me going was the meaty mechanics, which outweighed the repetition that brought me down on the game. I think that if you really like the idea of a game that incentivizes tons of planning and rewards the player for said planning, then you’re going to absolutely love this game.\n\nSo, do I recommend Punch Club? It’s hard to say, because while I don’t think this is the game for me, I can still totally recommend it to others. I like it because of how interesting the game’s mechanics are, and how it encourages the player to think and plan out their actions to ultimately create the number #1 boxing king. But if it doesn't look like your thing, then it won't be.\n\nTL;DR - It’s fantastic aesthetics and well-thought out mechanics help hold up an otherwise repetitive experience. Cautiously Recommend.\n\nFor more reviews on all sorts of games, follow  Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews  here!","March 25","true","9.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","4"

The game starts after a short cutscene displaying memories of your youth until the killing of your father. You ll start as an unknown street fighter and travel through many places and events before reaching your final objective.\n\nThe gameplay is all about managing your needs (health, food, mood and energy), increasing your stats (strenght, agility and stamina) and getting new skills to overcome the many challenges that you ll have to face before being the "king of the fighters hill". And, trust me, managing your daily life ll end up being a lot more complicated than what you could have expected at first. So get ready for a real challenge. That being said the game rewards your with a real feel of accomplishment when progressing through the fighters ladder, obtaining new skills and stuff like that.\n\nFights require you to select a couple of skills to counter those of your opponent, start the fight and wait till the end. This is probably one aspect of the game that could be greatly improved for the next Punch Club game. Also you ll rapidly realize that stats are way less important than skills to determine the outcome of a combat.\n\nThe game should last for about 10-15h for an average player before completing it. And there is a real replay value in the many choices offered during the game that modify places and people that the player ll encounter.\n\nUnfortunately Punch Club had a rough start because of the difficulty curve but devs seem to have realised after many negative reviews (that could have been avoided if they had listened at feedbacks provided during beta) that making games AND selling them doesn't only imply to satisfy your own creator/designer preferences but also those of potential customers. So if i had one advice for Punch Club 2 it would be to offer different difficulty modes (easy, normal, hard) to be sure that every kind of players could find the one that ll satisfy him the most.\n\nAll in all this isn't a bad game but one that still needs A LOT of rebalance and less stuborn devs that need to pay more attention to feedbacks provided by players and adapt their game accordingly. Because of it i can't recommand this game yet. My advice would be to give it 2-3 months and check if devs have really listened to players to deliver an enjoyable product.\n\n\n\n\nPros :\nVery good looking pixel art game for those that enjoy this art style.\nThe story feels like those old fighting movies from the 80s and early 90s.\nThe gameplay is quite simple to handle.\nA lot of easter eggs through the whole game lenght.\nThe game is quite challenging but...\n\nCons :\n... Can be very unforgiving if you don't follow the path thought by the game devs.\nYour daily tasks end up being quite repetitive.\nPassive fights that last for too long most of the time.\nThe soundtrack is nothing memorable.\nStubborn devs that don't listen enough at feebacks provided and seem to rather like to please themselves and their vision of what the game should be.","January 11","false","17.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

No, it’s going to be a 6-egg shake in the blender and scull down to get as much protein as you can.  Get to the gym for your last training session before your maiden fight later on tonight!\n\nPunch Club is strategy / management / fighting game where you play an individual whose father was a fighter and was assassinated in the middle of the street by a gunman, right in front of your eyes. His last words were “promise me to train harder son” (plenty of wisdom there!).\n\nYou will have to make money by delivering Pizzas or by working on the construction site so you can buy food, energy drinks and gym equipment. You can make money by winning fights, too, by the way. Ultimately, you want to set up your gymnasium in your own garage because it will cost you 10 dollars every time you going to the gym to train, plus it will take you time to get to a place by foot if you want to save money.  Make sure you develop your strength, agility and stamina so you can win fights and receive skill points which you will be able to use by purchasing new moves and techniques in the skill tree. You can make your mark in the rookie league or decide to try your luck with the ultimate fights which are held in an abandoned warehouse.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smithyq/recommended/394310/","smithyq","senseijkp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smithyq/","94 products in account","I enjoyed a good part of this game, but I also found it incredibly frustrating.  On the whole, the frustrations outweigh the fun.\n\nFor a fighting-style game, there is very little action.  All you do is manage your training and choose fight tactics.  I personally don't mind that, if it's done right.  If you prefer action games, this is definitly not for you.\n\nAs far as your training goes, it is far too easy to fall into a vicious spiral.  Here's the problem: your stats decrease every game day.  The higher your stats, the greater the decrease.  In the beginning, you need money to train, either to pay for the gym fee or to save up for your own home equipment.  To make money you need to work, which decreases your energy.  You then need to rest to refill your energy, which often takes you to the next day, which means your stats have just decreased.  You can spend a lot of time spinning your wheels this way.\n\nIf you could save a lot of money, it would be no problem, but you cannot.  The more money you have, the more likely you will be mugged by an RNG attacker.  If you don't train then you will lose these fights and half your money in the process.  Even if you DO train the RNG might still defeat you.  I can't tell you how frustrating it is to spend two or three in-game days working to get enough money to afford a big-ticket item only to get mugged on the way to the store and basically have to start all over.\n\nWhen you get to the actual combat,the game offers three different ways to build your character, but one is completely superior to the other choices.  It's not even close.  I tried to make my original build work, but I just got mired in that downward spiral I mentioned above.  Once I changed builds, it became very easy, to the point I didn't even need to change my abilities or tactics.\n\nThere are also several minor annoyances that add up to more frustration.  There's no way to speed up or advance text, as it just automatically scrolls.  This adds unnecessary seconds to every conversation, every time you visit the store, every time you talk to your training partner, etc.  Also, you spend most of your time training or working, and these seem incredibly slow.  The game could go three times as fast without issue, but instead I'm stuck waiting for my guy to spend 30sec real time doing enough bench presses to make up for all the stats he lost 45sec ago.\n\nThe game has an interesting idea and has some potential, but it's current form is unbalanced, making it either trivial or agonizing.  It's always frustrating.  You can spend a lot of time without making any tangible progress.  I can't recommend it in its current form, or at its current price.  Especially it's current price.","January 9","false","15.8"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","0"

But the delivery completely misses.\n\nYou can easily find yourself in a situation where you have to delete your save, simply because you ran out of the ability to feed yourself.\n\nYou can easily find yourself grinding for hours upon hours, only to get nowhere because your AI makes fight selections that are not nearly as clever as the enemy. For example, my character refused to attack for 2 whole rounds, while the opposing AI pegged down my 200 HP to 0, while he sat at 15.\n\nYou're clearly supposed to find a grind pattern (as the devs say it themselves) but it seems strange to not just build a game with the intention of user choice.\n\nDid I mention the part where you can be robbed for having too much money, with no way of safely surviving as every time you're hit up by a robber he's about double your abilities?\n\nThe grind is brutal, if only you had a difficulty setting where you could just play through the game without being in an endless grind, I mean you set up the values for XP gain and monetary earnings per job, is it really that hard to do difficulty? It isn't, I know for a fact it isn't.\n\nOverall, unless you want a frustratingly grindy game that possibly has one clear pattern to "win", avoid at all costs.\n\nUpdate since the review:\n\nI have put in several more hours into it, and had to remake a character (strength builds are an impossibility in this game, funny how a whole skill tree is pointless, i've heard the same for stamina builds) -- if you want to succeed grind agility as often as you can.\n\nIt's still a massively dissapointing grind even into the later stages of the game. the diminishing returns of a day passing versus the quickest points you can earn is a massive frustration point. The upkeep is a frustrating moment and even using steroids in the game you'll still have a rough time.\n\nGames similar to this (Kairosoft, game dev tycoon, etc) don't nearly have as much of a grind as this game seems to encourage. It's a shame that I am nearing the end point of this game, but I have (once again) hit a massive wall.","January 8","false","19.1"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

Training my character and making trade-off choices throughout my character's day makes for an interesting "fighter simulation" game. However in my opinion the balance is wayyyy too harsh such that the game ends up feeling punishing and stressful.\n\nWhen I first found out that you lose a little bit of stats every day I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off because, well it feels really bad to lose progress. However I got over it by thinking 'well maybe there will be a way to gain stats faster than just doing pushups everyday and losing some stats wont actually end up mattering that much'. Then I unlocked the sports store and was like 'oh awesome I can buy new equipment that helps me focus-train specific stats faster/more efficiently!'.\n\nSo I worked a job for a couple of days to save up enough to buy the machine that lets me focus-train strength. Then, on my way to the sports store to buy the expensive piece of equipment I got stopped by a random encounter in the street which I couldn't beat and lost half of my money... The most infuriating part of this encounter was that I paid to take the bus to the sports store which I assumed automatically kept me from encountering random enemies on the street b/c it costs cash and it's also a freakin' bus (instead it seems the only point of paying to take the bus is to avoid losing time in your character's day).\n\nSo at this point I feel punished for trying to work toward a specific goal in the game, and worst of all I don't know what I can do to get better at approaching this situation. Overall it is unclear to me how to get better at this game, which is really frustrating b/c I want to love it. I'm sure if I seeked out the information and did a bunch of reading I could figure out how to min/max this game and be successful, but to be honest I don't think I should have to work that hard this early on in the experience to find joy in the game. So for now I'm hanging up my gloves and moving on to other games I've yet to play in my library.\n\n\n-D\n\n","January 9","false","0.9"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

Story) is one of those games I've been keeping an eye [of the Tiger] on for a while now. Not just for its cute pixel art or its attempts to bring the frantic micro-management of tycoon games to the boxing ring but for its sense of fun.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfnqQsd2dek\n\nThe game really is a love letter to the 80's & 90's, not just from it 16-bit styling (there is even a "Retro Effect" you can toggle on and off in the options) but especially for all it's nods and homages to pop culture of the time. I grew watching stuff like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and those classic, cheesy action movies. (Back when Stallone and Schwarzenegger were kings of the box office and not appearing in TV adverts selling bread or car insurance.) And to see all that kind of stuff woven into the game and so lovingly referenced does put a smile on my face.\n\nAt it's core the game is more management sim than fighting game, that will have you you running all over town attempting to balance your training & fighting with the very real need to work in order to earn enough money so you can actually eat. At times this can feel like a grind and if you are expecting some kind 2D brawler or beat 'em up this probably isn't the game for you. But if you are a child of the 80's/90's and after something to scratch that slightly strategic/RPG itch this is definitely worth stepping into the ring for.","January 8","true","19.4"," 30 of 54 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","30","54","2","0"

As said in the title, what you basically do is train your fighter to become the best. The story is intriguing and it is challenging at the same time. The free DLC was released not too long ago which is a great addition for those who are seeking to play more. Some challenges of this game include: Not being able to work because of lack of energy which will lead to many other things (i.e no money, no food, can't progress in game). It took me a bit to get back on track with my skills in each category (strength, agility, stamina) which can help you win fights. The way you increase those skills is by going to gym and working out.\n\nThis game does not require any sort of street fighter combat, rather you let the game play itself and each fighting round, you can modify your strategies. So it's basically a Rocky Balboa Manager simulator with great gameplay and storyline.\nYou also have to watch out for things that could potentially make the game difficult such as working too much, which means when you travel to a place you could potentially get robbed because of earning too much money. Then you would have to fight the person trying to rob you and if you lost the fight, you lose some of your money.\n\nI'd rate this game a 10/10 which is lenient of me because I didn't pay attention to the really specific aspects of it since I hadn't noticed anything wrong after playing the game.","March 13","true","5.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

At a certain point I had a very strong fighter (about 20 strength) but not that great in agility (about 7, since the game makes it impossble to upgrade and maintain all three stats) and I went up against some Bruce Lee type of guy. This dude had a strength of 2!!!! So I was 10 times stronger then him yet I was unable to hit him even once. On top of that he had some perk that caused my missed swings to do damage to myself. WTF?? At the end of the fight I did not hit him once but he didn't hit me either ... So how exactly does this work?? I knocked myself out????????\n\nGame is great fun for a short time. Too bad they stretched it waaaaaaay too long instead of adding more actual content. And towards the end the game just gets ridiculous. The concept of working out like a madman to gain 100 strength, only to lose 99 of it the moment you walk out of the gym, is just stupid. Note to the developers: that's not how training works. It's just an extremely exaggerated mechanism to make the game seem longer.\n\nNot worth the current price.","January 16","false","9.6"," 63 of 118 people (53%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","53","63","118","20","4"

After several hours of playing through it, just when I thought I had beaten it...a whole new game opens up with some cool new stuff to do & explore & you realize the game you were playing, which was fun enough as it was, was just the beginning.  Very cool the way that was implemented.  I wont mention more as to not spoil things.\n\nAs a lot of the negative reviews will state, this game has your stats constantly decaying each day, which at first I found extremely annoying & aggravating, to the point I thought this game was just screwed up & badly implemented & balanced.  But after I had played through my first game a while & learned some important things the hard way, I decided to give it another try & start over & the 2nd time around was much easier & less frustrating of an experience & more enjoyable & rewarding.\n\nThe KEY is, DO NOT focus on all 3 stats, just as youre warned about in game, no matter how much your instinct tells you to, you cannot focus on all 3 stats or yes, the game will turn into a HUGE grind fest, with very little progression.  This is where I think a lot of the negative reviews are coming from, as I myself could have easily done the same had I not decided to try again.\n\nThe path you take will determine what 2 out of 3 stats you should focus on.  After some time & practice, youll better understand & see this first hand.  You can still focus somewhat on the 3rd stat here & there, but you should do so sparingly.  Also there are perks you can chose that prevent your stats from declining below a certain level as you advance further which is very helpful.  This game is all about finding the middle ground & balancing your time & actions which that in itself is its own strategy, apart from the rest of this game.\n\nAll in all, a very worthwhile experience, if youre willing to take the time to figure it out.  True the stats declining I feel could still be eased up on just a little bit.  But its not as bad as, or a game breaker as some of the reviewers would have you believe, again as long as you know what you are doing & take the time to figure it out.  Once you do, its a very challenging but enjoyable experience with some very unique & original ideas implemented quite nicely to discover along the way.","May 14","true","42.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

The money system in the game is completely unbalanced.  If you schedule a fight you can't work or your stats will drop right before the fight.  If you ever have a decent amount of money on you  you get mugged traveling.  Although you can take the bus, but you really can't afford to.  As you build skills they become more expensive.  There should be a level tier for the stats and certain should be more expensive than others.  Instead beginner skills you passed on can be as expensive as the best skills in the game.  The more skills you buy the longer it takes to acquire another one.\n\nWorking out your stats is a lesson in futility since all your stats drop at the end of every single day.  The game constantly blind sides you and often has glitches.  I thought this would play a bit like game dev tycoon, but its not even close to the same caliber.  It needs to be tweeked for its balance issues.  Also its frustrating that every time you want to go to the gym it costs 10 dollars.  Not a week in the game or month, but every time you want to use it.  Training at the beginning is difficult because you make 50 bucks for 12 hours of work.  Which can buy you two steaks that is enough to replenish your hunger bar.  Sadly your hunger bar empties if you sleep like you are starving.  You can get money from fighting, but early on its nothing like 20 bucks.  You can get a guy who will boost your training, but all he ever wants to do is drink and chill.  Also you can beat his motor and try to nail his sister.  Really the game is a waste of time and really acts like it.

Lots of interesting things to do, interesting skills, etc. However after you get a short ways into the game all content peters out and all there is left to do is grind exercise and fights. And the ending doesn't just fall flat, it imploded in on itself.\n\nI will say what IS there is enjoyable, but the game is full of loose ends, unfinished/unpoloshed features, and various bugs. Also, take the agility build because otherwise you may never finish the game. It took me 121 in-game days to finish  the game with an agility build.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DJBola/recommended/394310/","DJBola","Dyllusional","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DJBola/","291 products in account","Punch Club is a Game, but not a Fighting Game. I'm not going to talk about the story as I haven't gotten very far in it but it is loaded with Fighting Game/Movie tropes which can be a bummer for some people. The Game is split into two parts, the Training/Life Mode and the Fighting Mode. Training/Life has you going about the town raising your stats and lowering your meters. This leads to the most grindy aspect of the game, the loop of Work for Money, Spend Money for Meter/Stats, Work for Money. With Fights happening inbetween. A Large problem with the game for most people in the beginning is the fact that your stats will go down over time, this can be stopped by spending your upgrade points after a threshold.\n\nThis is Not a Fighting Game. There are no Inputs, no Frame Data, none of that. This is almost an Idle game. You load up your character with Moves which have stats and your character will randomly (as far as I can tell) do those moves. You have Defensive moves such as Dodge and Block, and you have your Offensive moves which are a large suite of kicks and punches.  Thats not to say the system is overly simple. You can have fun thinking of ways to beat specific opponents. Do you go for the classic Rope-A-Dope and focus on defense for the first few rounds or do you attempt an early round knock out? Both of those tactics are good for different people.\n\nMy Main gripe of this game is the upgrade tree. Moves are not a flat cost. A standard Kick, while being early on the tech tree, if taken later can cost as much as an end game upgrade. This makes the game force you down one tree, Strength, Dexterity, or Stamina, as you unlock far better moves down one tree than spending the same amount for a starter move down the other.\n\nOverall I would say that you should wait before picking it up. This is not a bad game, but some changes would make it better. This will give it time for the devs to update the game and provide balance changes and for the price to drop and hopefully someone will provide a tool to make moves have a reasonable cost.","January 12","true","0.9"," 22 of 40 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","22","40","3","0"

Very buggy. In my 6 hours of playing, I've had to restart the game at least 10 times because my character would get stuck and I couldn't click on anything. There have also been times where my character would get stuck in an activity (like sleeping) and I couldn't cancel it upon them reaching max rest, so I had to wait for a whole day while he slept until his hunger went too low, forcing him out of bed.\n\n2. SOOOOO GRINDY LATE GAME. OOOOOH gosh the grind late game is just awful, seriously, don't underestimate it. I read some reviews previous to buying saying that and thought "Meh, it can't be that bad". IT IS. Around 4 - 5 hours in, the game just becomes a nonstop grind if you want to increase skills. What makes the grind even more irritating is that at the end of every day, your skills all decay a bunch, so I'll spend my whole day training and I'll get a level in two skills and feel great, then when the day ends I lose 80% of what I've trained, and it's INFURIATING. Really awful, I seriously hope there are some cheats that can use, cause otherwise, I'm done with this game. Early on the grind isn't bad, especially because it's new, but after 5 hours it just becomes absolutely horrific.\n\nTLDR: Late game is "OH GOD WHY KILL ME"-level of grind. Very buggy, have to restart game multiple times.

It has a great boxing themed chip-tune style soundtrack. The graphics are pleasingly retro without coming off as pretentious. The publisher and developer are super awesome folks who kindly provided me a key for streaming and review purposes(Please note that this fact does not flavor my opinion of the game itself, but I do have serious appreciation for developers who help the small-time youtubers and twitch streamers such as myself). So should you buy this game? First ask yourself the following questions:\n\nDo you enjoy boxing?\nHave you ever watched at any point any Rocky movie?\nDid you play punch out as a kid and love it?\nDid you watch and enjoy Fight Club?\nDo you like management-style tycoon like games?\nDo you like well done neo-retro games?\nDo you have $10 in your bank account?\n\nIf you answered yes, or even maybe to any of the above questions - then yes! you should buy this game. I have lost several very enjoyable hours playing this game and know for certain that I am going to lose many more. It's that kind of experience. Offers a lot of customization in how you build and develop your boxer allowing room for plenty of experimentation and replay value. Here is a video of me streaming this game on Twitch. My viewers loved watching me play it. In fact - this game brought some extra followers into my stream. This is the moment my twitch stream hit 200 followers! So not only is this game fun to play, not only is it made by awesome people, but it helped me reach an important milestone on my twitch stream. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ-TaVGczUU (I cuss, so the video may be NSFW if you're in a sensitive workplace).","February 4","true","7.6"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","12","21","2","0"

BUT there's a lot that the game hits you with at once (the superhero content really gets in the way) and you get shoehorned into doing certain things which inhibits a feeling of freedom. For instance: the game starts by saying you should read a paper but then makes you go into the garage to train, then eat food THEN you get to go to the paper. Similarly, going to work for the first time, you get railed off to another location which takes time. It springs location shifts on you now and then which forces time/money questions - and basically could sink you.\n\n.... AND the fights are incredibly, incredibly, incredibly:\nA) Unpredictable,\nand worst of all\nB) Boring.\n\nReally needs either something for the player to be doing during the fights (say, perhaps being a photographer or something to earn more money during the match), OR needs a 'quick fight' button, OR needs a playspeed multiplier button. There's zero reason why you can't give me an option to speed up the fight scenes by 2/4/8x speed. Gameplay wouldn't be affected, I'd still see everything I need (which since it's all RNG, is nothing) and I would be less bored.\n\nedit: Also, stat decay really wasn't something I'm an entire fan of - it seems way aggressive. I realise this is something that happens to athletes, etc - but in this case I think they need to turn that rate wayyyy down.","June 5","false","1.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

I loved all the TV and movie references sprinkled around the world (Fight Club, Rocky, Snatch, TMNT, Pulp Fiction, etc, etc.) I just felt ultimately everything gets way too repetitive. The training and working you have to be in a constant balancing act doing days and days and days of keeping stats and money in check while making sure you have enough food to be able to not starve. Just seems like way too much time doing this stuff instead of getting to fight. The fighting feels pretty shallow too, overall. Didn't thrill me at all. Also, no variety in music.

I also got so emotional when i turned on the retro mode as my TV once again had the type of screen that it did when i was 10 that i actually just listened to the opening music and stared nostalgically at the main menu screen in the main theme for about ten minutes simply taking in and flashing back.  I miss those days...\n\nThe game isn't easy, because they never used to be.  Games never held your hand, they were not your sparring partner, they were your enemy.  Games used to kick the living ♥♥♥♥ out of me and laugh, and I kept coming back for more.  Why?  BECAUSE THATS HOW I GOT BETTER.  Not by having constant respawns and automatic save points, but by dying three times and having to start all the way back at the beginning.  On that note I found myself attempting to exploit a potential weakness that had the potential to break a core mechanic of the game.  I soon realized realize that the devs had accounted for it.  They knew I had grown soft in todays gaming market, and they were here to make me pay.\n\n....In the beginning of the game, Mick (yes THAT mick) says that if you need a hot meal to come and see him.  Thinking that this was a no questions asked kind of deal, i tried to take full advantage of this foolish old mans hospitality.  The first time my character, who I named Billy (If you don't get this reference then LEAVE), got really hungry, I went at ate at Micks.  Then I tried going over for a mid day snack.  Thats when I realized Mick would only feed my character if he was super hungry.  So as I was saving up for home workout equipment (using the gym is expensive)  I figured I'd save money by starving myself, then going to Micks for a free meal... Mick knew my scheme, he knew I had cash and basically told me to go to hell.  So then I decided to live the life of a poor but determined fighter, spend all of my time training, earning no money, and just treat micks like a "god damn soup kitchen" (go watch "ROCKY").  The old man had finally had enough.  After a warning about this being my last meal there, he never fed me again.  Having not learned my lesson, I wound up being too hungry to work,, broke my arm in an underground fight, and had to restart my game due to starvation.... for half a second I tried to reach for a reset button.  Gonna say it once more, I love this game.\n\nDevs, I have a couple reccommendations (Wishes?) regarding the actual fights, ones which I don't believe would screw up any sort of coding if implement.  During fights, i found myself looking for a couple animations which i assumed would be there given the 16 bit retro nature of the game.\n1.  An "exhaustion stance" when a stamina bar or Energy bar (or both?) is low.  Just a slighjtly different animation than the usual fighting stance.  Saturday Night Slam Masters implemented this back in the day on the SNES and it really added an extra level of emersion.\n2.  It would be cool to see the winner of a fighter preen for a second like all retro fighting game characters did.\n3.  Just an extra frame or two of animation as a character rises from the mat in the vein of  Mike Tyson's Punch-Out and Double Dragon 2\n4.  A couple sprays of blood (Obviously being able to be turned off for the squeamish) every couple of punches wouldnt hurt from a 90's stand point.  No need to go TIME KILLERS with it, but you get the idea :)\n\nagain, not a coder, don't know how easy or hard it is to implement these things, but would it add a layer of immersion which I feel is missing from the game.\nThank you Devs.\nI'm happy to say that you've nailed what a retro game is both asthetically as well as  is at its heart and soul better than any game out there on the market.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LetsPlayThisBro/recommended/394310/","LetsPlayThisBro","LetsPlayThisBro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LetsPlayThisBro/","29 products in account","For some reason this game is very addictive to me.  It's satisfying to build up a fighter and evolve techniques to win.  I've always been a re-roller in every game I've ever played in order to try different playstyles, unfortunately not all playstyles seem to work in this game with a balance issue where Agility is the key to victory and if you build a character with that in mind you can develop really strong.\n\nTime management is the real pain in this game, the timer that moves from day to day seems to move too fast for the amount of either money earned or recovery gained from sleep.  It's almost impossible to eat/sleep/work/workout in a single day because BOOM, it's the next day.  One of the annoying little ticks I hope they fix is, when the day rolls over from one to the next it stops you in the middle of what you started, just started lifting weights 5 minutes ago, well you'll have to click to acknowledge the change from one day to the next, then click to initiate the thing you were doing before the day change or, and sometimes this is more efficent move on to something else.\n\nIn spite of the balance issues I'm still having fun with it.  Also, quick tip, don't buy workout equipment for your home, for some reason the "fun" level doesn't seem to go up as high as it does when you just go to the gym and workout there. Dunno if that's a glitch or a mechanic of the game to get you to go out and burn time going from point A to B or what, but it makes little sense to have a "fun" rating on a piece of workout equipment if when you use it at home your "fun" level doesn't rise accordingly while using it.\n\nAs long as the devs remain engaged in this and impliment a few tweeks this game has a lot of potential.  But like any other game, it's not for everyone it's a niche game to be sure.\n\nEDIT: Now that I've spent more time in the game the grindfest of it becomes really apparent and there are aspects to it which make it very difficult to advance from the amature side of things to the pro.  But once you break into the pros the game becomes much much easier, but still grindy, never sleep, always workout, make enough money to support yourself and build up your skills. Lots of energy drinks, lots of protein bars in the gym, I prefer to use the public gym because I can step out the door once a day to do the sparring and get some free skill points.  Lather rinse repeat, lather rinse repeat.... It's grindy, but not in the worst way possible. There are little things you learn early on which make the grind less grindy, but that's the fun in the game, figuring it out.\n\nStill recommend, and for 10 bucks you get a lot of gameplay from it. I'm running it again because there were achievements I haven't unlocked and storyline I cut myself off from by choosing one path over another, or even not meeting my "girlfriend" to help me work out. Gonna see how that works out.","February 10","true","38.9"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

It's time management, decision making, trial and error, and strategy-formulating. It's a mechanic that was intended to bring challenge into the game and provoke thought into the gameplay. Yes, it sucks losing the time, money, and energy you spent to raise that stat five minutes ago just for it to drop the next day, but that's what the game is about. I'd be complaining about it too, but the game gives you AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME TO PLAY THROUGH IT. Can't manage your money, energy, and stats? Keep playing until you snowball and get to the point where you can. The worst thing that can happen is a loss of a high score.\n\nI can hardly give a ♥♥♥♥ about the game, but I can say that the negative reviews have no ground to stand on and the game is worth me defending it. Because of the lost success of Punch Club, I'm more than happy to support it.","March 27","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Let's hit the less than stellar points right off the bat, then I'll tell you why you should totally buy this game.\n\nIt's completely retro.  Now, understand, I'm not saying that in itself is a bad thing; but it does mean it's not very pretty.  The graphics are like early 90's at best.  So's the dialog - pretty bad in spots.  Know what else is quite retro?  In the later gameplay it can be a bit buggy.\n\nWhere's why it's awesome.  It just keeps moving - the game is a blast to play.  The storyline - despite less than Shakespearian dialog - is actually quite entertaining (in an over-the-top, steal-from-every-80's movie they can kind of way.)\n\nAnd just when I think I'm about to beat the game's last level, guess what!  There's another level on top of that.  This has happened three times now, and I still haven't finished it.  I would have been satisfied with ending after the second "stage" - for a $10 game.  And, what's more, I would have immediately started replaying it - it's that fun.\n\nBest entertainment purchase I've made in awhile.  Or worst - since I'm getting absolutely nothing done.

The central mechanic to how successful you are at using your in game days is balacing energy with need for food and your mood, which all decreases as you work at a job...\n\nA lot of time spent "playing" the game is spent balancing these stats... it's really boring after awhile and you just want to play (sorry, "watch") the game you paid out 10$ for after awhile...\n\nAnother thing that kind of fell flat for me is the cameos different 90s movie actors. They're not thrown in any kind of way that would imply the designer didn't do it just to say "Look! Tyler from fight club!" ... the pixelated character you meet is actually named Tyler... and is out back of the same bar in the movie... This follows suit with a few others - although, the ninja turtle you meet is a aligator, which is kind of cool.\n\nComparing this to a game like Chroma Squad brings out its flaws. Both are meant to be pixelated 90s nostolga trips down memory lane, to the shows and violent fight movies of our youths, but Punch Club just seems... idk... recycled...\n\n3/10.

The idea of a Professional Fighting RPG with a storyline appealed to me like all hell. And while I'd be lying if I said I didn't have fun with this game, the fun dries up pretty fast. It's entirely possible that I played the game exactly wrong, but the required balancing act of earning money, training, and restoring your 'hunger' and 'rest' meters seemed unreasonably difficult to juggle without causing massive detriment to your training due to the absolute need to buy food, as you can do literally nothing on an empty stomach. Not even sleep. At the end of my five hours of playing, the game seemed to devolve into endlessly watching meters fill up and empty, broken up by the occasional fight that you have zero input in other than occasionally rearranging what moves your character is capable of performing. It almost felt like the game was built for microtransactions to speed things up, even though no such system exists in this game.\n\nMaybe I was playing wrong. Maybe you're supposed to throw yourself into constant battle. Maybe I was gonna unlock easier ways to do everything. Maybe I shouldn't have believed Mick when he said he wouldn't give me free meals anymore when I was low on money. Maybe this game's exactly as charming and fun as I hoped it would be!

Combat is 100% RNG based, meaning you have no control of what your guy does, more often then not he just stands there for some time and literally eats there attacks and my dodging abilities don't proc either, making me lose a fight I normally should have won. Or sometimes I would dominate the 1st round then apparently forget how to fight for the remainder of the match and just eat his attacks. Or my energy would just plummet for undisclosed reasons and falls significantly faster then my opponents. Most of my opponents didn't have anything to drain my stamina or energy either and my stamina is usually far superior as well so I really don't know why it just randomly drops some fights and then on a rematch against the exact same person with the exact same stats and moves my energy literally doesn't move during the fight and I blow them away. It is just bad examples of RNG ruining what is otherwise a fun system. Allow us to actually control the fight this would remove a lot of the stress and annoyance with the fighting system\n\nThe stats and skills are also comically unbalanced. Agility is by far the best as it literally has no weakness it gives you. Increases your dodging chance and chance to hit. The skills in the category(way of the tiger) have high natural base damage so strength is 100% completely worthless and focus around dodging and counter attacking. Dodging of course is god like and it makes the attack miss. Strength just raises your damage but has a pretty serious flaw, it significantly increase the energy cost of your skills. The skills that go with Strength(way of the bear) focus on blocking, which reduces the damage you take, vastly inferior to dodging. The attacks are powerful but come with a low chance to hit, meaning you are never going to hit anyone as everyone has good agility so chances of hitting these moves are to low. Stamina is good for regaining energy during fights and it's tree(way of the turtle) focus around odd skills that debuff your opponent, dealing respectable damage and taking tremendous amounts of punishment. Unfortunately these skills don't seem to work, at all. If they do then the effect need to be buffed quite a bit. In fact both Strength and Stamina need buffed heavily. Give the Strength attacks a very high base chance to hit and actually make the Stamina skills work or if they do work make them actually worth using as of right now no point. Agility can arguably be nerfed significantly by making your damage lower the more points of Agility you acquire. This would balance things out a lot, As far as training the stats it is a grind fest of grind fests and can literally take HOURS to raises stats even by a few levels at higher and later stages of the game. To make it worse you lose a significant amount of stats at the end of the day and can literally lose all the time and effort needed to raise them in the 1st place, especially if you get hurt or need to make money you can lose days of progress in just 1 day. Significantly reducing or even removing the stat dropping system would be a major boon for the game, it's not fun seeing days of progress go away simply because I needed to work to make money.\n\n\nFinally there is the money issue. At the start money is hard to come by as your jobs are delivering pizza and working construction. Both pay terribly and really hurt your non combat stats(hunger, energy, mood all of which are needed to be efficient at workouts adding more issues to the stat system.)After getting into the yellow league at the ultimate fights did my money issue go away as you make good money there but prior to that it is just simply enraging as fighting in the rookie league only gives about 20 bucks and ultimate fights give more but not enough. Making money so rare and hard to come by at the start on top of everything else just adds unwanted stress to a already stressful game. Later on money and food is no longer and issue but early on it is a major problem, and if you do it wrong a potentially game ending one. And by game ending I mean literally game ending, start a new game and try again game ending, which is inexcusable and lazy difficulty addition.\n\nOverall its not a bad game and has a good concept with a bad story but the concept alone is enough just has a few major problems that need fixed as currently things are quite unbalanced and the RNG factor needs to be removed ASAP as that alone would make the game recommendable to play, even though it is quite overpriced as this game is not worth $10. Maybe $5 but I'm being generous. Wait to purchase but keep an eye on the updates to learn when the game will be fixed, as currently it is almost unplayable at the start do to how badly the deck is stacked against you. I didn't find it fun, I honestly thought at times I was literally fighting God himself in the game with how poorly everything was going in my favor.\n\nAlso another thing that could improve is actually the developers of the game listening to the negative feedback. Even people who are recommending the game are also saying the game has flaws. In fact many people who recommend and don't recommend the game are actually giving the same critique of the game and pointing out the same flaws.It's my understanding that there was a open beta for the game and was criticized with all the same things it is currently being criticized with now and the dev's didn't seem to listen to any of it and currently appear to be not listening either which is unfortunate as they have a great concept, it just needs them to be less stubborn and listen to there fans. Yes getting your work criticized is hard to take but overall listening to us is for the better to make this game a much more polished and high quality product as your product has some issues, some big ones which will indeed turn off A LOT of people. As a game developer you want as many people to play your game and listening and using the feedback to grow is usually a solid 1st step to becoming a great developer.","January 20","false","37.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's slow paced but once you get past the early grind you get to try different tactics at fights. You get wider range of skills to choose from and they support different situations. If you try to smash your opponent down quick, you might run out of stamina. And if you go for a long fight plan, can you dodge enough to bring your opponent down with small hits. And so on..\n\nFor streamers there's a betting system that lets your viewers to bet on the winner of the fight and it will let you win some lil prizes on publishers website.

It's very passive in play style, much like some anime style time-management games where you schedule your characters actions per day and try to have the skills and stats unlocked to accomplish goals.  There's content enough for at least two plays through the game depending on the choices you make.  There are some balance issues that still need to be addressed and the daily stat drain is brutal, but, that's mostly because they want you to play the game a specific way and the specific way is through unlocking and choosing the correct skills versus simply getting high stats.  This forcing of a specific play style is further evidenced by how overpowered some particular choices are versus the other obvious avenues.  Agility is way stronger and easier to play compared to Stamina or Strength.\n\nIt's a fun game worth checking out.  It's chock full of 80's references and jokes.  It's amusing enough to have kept me interested for 8+ hours which is decent value for the cost, assuming I'm not going to finish it in the next 15 minutes.","January 10","true","17.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

You can spend an ample amount of time working on getting your build just right and once you are doing well, there is a direction for you to go in the story.\n\nA very important factor that most don't seem to see on the surface is that skills are more important than stats or anything really. Case in point, there are skills that allow you to keep your stats at certain ranges without having to work out, leaving you time to focus on something other than working out (and consequently getting food and sleep to fuel those workouts).","January 10","true","17.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

You're a punk out to avenge your father's death through YOUR ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FISTS. Life's hard and you have to work hard and train hard. Think it's okay to spend a day chilling with your bro, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the day away? World champs don't have time for that.\n\nPunch club shows the difficulty of trying to maintain a life balance whilst trying to hone your body. Yes that day at the gym will be wasted if you spend a whole week delivrring pizzas. But a man has got to eat and how else will you put something on the dinner table whilst a scrapping the barrel of the rookie league boards?\n\nPunch club gives you the choice of trying to find the killer by being a legit world class struggling to make ends meet or go through the underworld where you may face other challenges with a branching storyline.\n\nAs for the gameplay, punch club forces you to balance your time and money. Your stats: Strength, Agility and Stamina are increased by using gym equipment ( one kind of training has a fatigue meter forcing you to use less efficient ones if you wish to train one stat more in a time frame) and stats degrade daily. Eventually to surpass certain limits you will need to make training a full time duty.  There are also Skills which are unlocked from skill points earnt from fights. Therefore combat experience will allow the benefits of training to come to fruition. The skill tree branches according to which stat you wish to focus on.\n\nFights are mostly automatic where you choose the skills you want for the round and then watch. Rounds last 30s and vary in number depending on 'tournament' rules. Will you focus on high accuracy moves to catch the pesky dodgers, attempt to exhaust them with blocks and hard throws or become whirlwind counter attacker? You can see your upcoming opponent usually and spend the days of training crafting your strategy to beat them - this can be quite important! You don't want try to tire out a boundless ball of energy or focus on hard hitting but inaccurate slugs against a nimble foe.\n\nHowever don't expect to learn more than 1 or 2 moves before your next fight. One snag of strategy is the imbalance between builds. As of now, agility based builds are generally considered superior. What good is your strength if not only to your exhausting yet killer punches not only fail to connect at all but also injure yourself for a proportional amount? My high level strength character had to rely on basic boxing punches to catch moderate agility foes without raising agility equal to theirs and a repeated misses would devastate myself; meanwhile their weakness is just a lower Hp pool with their damage based on doing my damage back to me albeit more reliably!. Hopefully the developers will even the routes out and even days after release have been working tirelessly to address our criticisms. Agility currently is an absolute must to maintain a bare minimum of near parity with your opponent whilst the other two are optional. This may be as simple to fix as just lowering the dodge chances however so expect this game to be in a better state soon.\n\nIs it worth it now? Mostly depends on how much much you like grinding. Those liking jrpgs shouldn't have much issue but if you want something suited for quick blasts, no. Right now the game can be a bit frustating at times before you've developed your style and hav eexperimented around. At the same time part of the charm is the difficulty; I do not think there is any sort of gameover mechanic i.e. death, running out of time etc., stat degradation can mean you may find yourself in a slump where progression feels challenging. If you're having a hard time maybe someone might just offer you a 'magic potion'. Either way any fan of 80s TV and old fighting games will be sure to love all the cheeky nods.","January 10","true","27.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

However the rounds can be quite long, and if you adopt an energy-expensive strategy (hard to assess in advance), you can be lost before that round is over and a readustment can be made.\n\nI unlocked a lot of skills throughout the game (got to the end of the "way of the tiger" tree), but had to forgo all but the cheapest in terms of energy. The way that energy use increases quite as it does when your strength increases seems unfortunate.\n\nAlso the game seemed bugged in some respects. E.g. a "reflect damage" perk didn't seem to work, while a "poison your opponent for the rest of the fight - kick" was useless [energy cost way too high to use against a decently matched opponent, & poison stopped working anyway], and a 'restrictive perk' ('your Str and Endurance cannot rise above 8') just plain didn't work. [Unsure if the "fix the broken engine" quest bit was broken also? at least, the considerable amount of time my char put into that engine didn't fix it ever!]\n\nThis game looks/looked like it had potential. Maybe with some changes (bug fixing, time acceleration, and active fighting) it would fix it. As it stands maybe the very initial hour or two is fun. After that, not really fun, but you might sadly still be addicted! [relief when I finally got to the game over]\n\nThis was my first steam review. Have a nice day!","January 23","false","14.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I cannot off the top of my head recollect another title I would count as its peer.  That said, it would be important to evaluate it purely on its own merits and not attempt to compare it to any previous offering.  That too is a unique opportunity.\n\nWhat is Punch Club then?  Well it's more of a management sim than anything else.  The RPG elements are strong but the majority of your input in this game is balancing your fighter's activities to build up for the fights.  The skill trees are interesting and present some real head-scratching moments where you'll be making some very defining choices for your fighter.\n\nI beat this game in about 9 hours.  For a $10 game, that's not outside of what I would have expected.  The grindy nature of the game became VERY apparent in the final two to three hours of gameplay.  The novelty of the training and balancing your other activities will be gone by them time you're building up to your final ten fights.  There are some missed chances for some more cinematic presentations for those final fights too.  The opponents are less generic and it would have been an excellent opportunity to have special entrances, custom music, or maybe even mid-fight events.  Instead they become just another stepping stone to concluding the story.  At that point in the game, you've likely locked down your fight strategy so the probability that you're actually making meaningful adjustments is low.   Essentially you'll just be trying to maintain your stats between fights, and twiddling your fingers until the next match.\n\nThe exploration and story elements in the first half of the game are extremely solid.  You are introduced to a number of characters and branching story lines that allow you to spend some time outside of the organized fights.  Unfortunately that pace falls off about 60% through the game and it finished on a wimper rather than a bang.\n\nFor $10 I would recommend the game for those looking for something a bit different.  Don't expect a long and immersive experience, but a fun and interesting short one.","January 17","true","9.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I learned all the places I had to go to, started training right away without earning much money... big mistake. Stats go down every day, so if you don't train 'em, you lose 'em. If you're training though, that means you ain't making money. If you ain't making money, you can't buy food. If you don't buy food... you can't do anything... same with energy (sleeping). It took me a while to work out a simple mental schedule, but man... I got stuck at one point with too much hunger to sleep, and no way to get a bite. Mick only helps you so many times, and then you're on your own. I ended up trying to find SOME way to get food, because I couldn't sleep, I couldn't train, I couldn't do anything. I had to keep going from one area to another, hoping the time would pass by so I could get another fight, anything. I did eventually do an underground fight, which I lost but still earned money... but wow.\n\n\n\nI'm doing much better now, the game gets better if you stick with it; Reminds me of a day long past, where games weren't easy to play from the start, where you had to make some mistakes, lose a bit, and fumble to finally get that grasp. It's all too predictable for me now, it becomes boring; This game however, it actually made me THINK. I have to ensure I have the funds/income to keep feeding myself, as well as keeping at least certain stats at a decent threshold, lining up fights so I get practical experience so I can get more skills... I was afraid this would be a watered down fighting management RPG. Nope, this is the real deal, you're a no-name underdog coming up in the fighting sport, and you'll learn from scars, bruises and hard knocks. Pretty fun, a lot of things to do apart from just training, gotta keep relations with people, spar now and then, and other interesting things.\n\n\n\nIf you like the idea of managing an up and coming Little Mac from rags to riches... give this a whirl. Only suggestion I have is that it not be so easy to get stuck with low hunger, and no way to get food. The suspension of disbelief doesn't last long when you're trying to pass the time stuck on low hunger by travelling to places over and over. Really, you can't work or do anything, so getting the money to take care of your hunger is impossible after Mick's generousity runs out. It should at least be noted that he will only help you a certain amount of times, so players know to use him very sparingly.\n\n\nOther than that, I recommend this game to anyone looking to build up a ring fighter from couch bum to Rocky.","January 10","true","4.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

There are a few things i do not like about this game, for example the "days" doesn't progress unless you do something like work or train etc. I wish the game "days" would progress without doing anything? I feel the game is a litte to much "slow" paced cause of this.\nAnother thing i found is very annoying in this game is if i play the game on windows the save game progress doesnt get saved or synced with the mac version, so I can´t play between two computers and have the same save file apperantly..  Not a big problem, just annoying....\nAlso it seems like 32 is the maximum limit for Stamina, Strenght and Agility. I wish it would go higher.. At least to 100 maybe? 32 just seems so random tbh´....\nAnd it would be awesome if it would be possible to Increase these to over 100% Health, food, mood, energy.\n\nWhen you meet "Din Kong", things start to get a bit to much repetitive... You talk to Kong and do "career". There you get 3 available actions to choose (+ some upgrades you can buy, wich are pretty much almost pointless) so you can get Fame to organize the next fight.. I've gotten to the point were i am wondering, is this ever going to END?? What i find boring and repetitive about this career thing is you have to fight all this ninjas or "throw a party" to organize the next fight with and actual oponent. You have to fight at least a minimum of 12+ ninjas everytime to start a new fight.. This gets way to boring in the lenght and you only get 500+ fame after fighting all those random ninjas. They are even called Ninja 1, ninja 2 and so on.........

You do this by increasing your key stats (strength, agility and stamina) as well as training in skills (using skill points you get from fights). You maximum health increases as your stat total goes up.\n\nYou must also balance your human needs, such as hunger (buy food from the store or pizza place) and sleep (using the bed), mood (win fights or watch TV). You also have a health 'need', and the percentage full this is determines how much of your maximum health you have at the start of a fight.\n\nYou increase your stats by working out (obviously). You start the game with only a workout mat to do push-ups on, but there is also a gym with a wide variety of equipment, though you have to pay to use it. You can also save up money and buy your own gym equipment for your home gym. Your stats will decrease every day, and you'll lose more stat points the higher your stats are. This encourages you to focus on one key stat and increase the others to a lesser degree.\n\nAs for the fights themselves, you have no direct control over them. You can decide which skills your character can use each round, but you have zero actual control over when he attacks or with what.\n\nHowever, there are some key problems I have.\n\nOnce you get beyond the very early stages, your stats decrease far too fast. Unless you really REALLY focus on building that stat as the only thing you do, your progress will be pitiful. In the early game this is a nightmare to do, as you also have to go to your job to earn cash, which you need to buy gym entry as well as food to stop being hungry.\n\nAlso, it is very easy to have a drought of skill points after certain thresholds in the story. Normally, you get some skill points if you lose a fight, and a lot more for winning. You can also pay to spar with the gym coach for a tiny amount of skill points. So once you exhaust the fights from other story elements, your only source of skill points is from the coach, who gives very little and you have to pay him every time, and can only fight him once per game day.\n\nAs with most tycoon type games, things get a lot easier in the later game when you are a professional fighter. You can get automatic daily income, and you have an in house chef who makes free food, which leaves you a lot of spare time to train. And you'll need every minute of it, as by this point your stats will tank every day.\n\nThe game relies far too much on setting you back to enforce grinding. I appreciate the stat degradation, as it simulates what happens when you don't work out. But when your stats drop by huge amounts daily, to the point where working on that stat becomes almost impossible, it just becomes silly. And when you combine large amounts of mandatory grinding with the same, short music track looping, it gets quite dull.\n\nAnd while the story is alright for what this game is, the ending is a total let down, with the a 'to be continued' after the credits, suggesting either a free story update or paid DLC further down the line.\n\nThe devs have done some balancing patches already, so kudos to them, but there is still a lot that can be done to make this game more enjoyable. Certainly at this point, even with balancing, Agility characters are overpowered. They are hard to hit and hard to evade, as Agility increases your evasion and accuracy. You can't hurt what you can't hit, and then they'll chip damage you to death.\n\nThis game really could be doing with being available on tablet, it strikes me more as something you'd play for a few minutes, or to pass time on a train/bus/plane.","January 10","false","24.6"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","6"

My training schedule was good and I was making 50 bucks a day doing road construction to afford my addiction to steak. After stopping some burgulars and street thugs I was quickly gaining respect and a solid reputation amonst the people in the town. I soon found my way into illegal fighting and became somewhat notorious. After defeating every amateur out there it was time to get my pro card. I trained the hardest in my life to lose in the opening round. The defeat shocked me as I have never lost before, but I didnt just lose I was dumpstered.\n\nLife spiraled downards at a stunning rate. I was losing stats and fights to the point where I could no longer afford food. I was too tired to work and constantly starving. This is when I met Roy. Roy was a guy I kicked the ♥♥♥♥ out of before but he was pretty cool. Roy and I began chilling and drinking brews on the daily while heading to the bars at night. By the way Roy had a banging sister so I went out and picked some flowers for her, but she didnt want the D until I beat up her brother in the front yard a couple of times. My stats continually decreased as drinking and flirting became the norm until I convinced Roy to train with me. Now with a gf and best friend and party's to attend every night, the only thing that would complete my life was that pro card.\n\nAfter training with the help of Roy I quickly gaining back my lost strength. Was getting back into fight shape after not fighting for multiple months. A little sparring here and there allowed me to hone my techniques. There was one problem however, I could still barely afford to feed myself and since no one else would fight there was no money to be made. I did the only logical thing to do which was join a local gang. Being a street thug I could make money easily. It only took a few weeks before the Don himself wished to see me.\n\nThe Don asked if I wanted to make more dough and if I'd join you see? He was appreciative of my hard work bullying others and dedication to pumping iron. The Don gave me a job and a gun incase I needed to protect myself and my girl Adrian. Before going on this job I had to kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of Roy another time so my girl would know who is alpha. Anyway I find this chinese ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, a real butthead stinking up the town with his healing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I tell him if he knew what was good for him he should leave and that ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ mofo left without hesitation.\n\nOn my way to the bar I get stopped by the ♥♥♥♥ing po-leece, them mother♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥ucking donut ♥♥♥♥ers. They arrest me on the spot for being armed with a firearm. And then I find myself in prison. I have 1 dollar to my name and can do nothing but eat sleep and ♥♥♥♥ING WORKOUT. WOO! For a mofo like me, prision was the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥! No responisbilities, no social ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, just straight pumping iron and getting sauced all day everyday. And sauced I got, every mofo was afraid of me after spending 95 days behind bars. I was in the best shape of my life.\n\nI gathered word that a security guard was organizing fights with the prize being freedom. I spent enough time in the brig and was craving that sweet old Adrian booty. you already know my ♥♥♥♥♥, love to hit that ♥♥♥♥ from the back.  I sign up and beat ever mother♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ other criminal they put infront of me. Freedom was mine my ♥♥♥♥♥, but freedom came at a cost. While I was locked up Roy had dissappeared and my side♥♥♥♥♥ Adrian tells me that I gotta into hiding. The Don agreed and set me up in some crackhouse ♥♥♥♥ing place which was ♥♥♥♥ing dope as ♥♥♥♥ my ♥♥♥♥♥. The Don knew I was sauced, the most sauced my ♥♥♥♥♥, and gave me my own ♥♥♥♥ing gang. I had my own goons, they werent the toughest, but dont play those ♥♥♥♥♥s in poker theyll rob ya blind my ♥♥♥♥♥. The house was small, but I got ♥♥♥ everynight and ofcourse got to  PUMP ♥♥♥♥ING IRON all day my ♥♥♥♥♥. You already know. WOO!\n\nAs a gang leader I had to proctect my turf homie. Those tiny ♥♥♥♥♥ucking yakuza ♥♥♥♥♥s were stinking up my territory so I beat the living ♥♥♥♥ out of them, my ♥♥♥♥♥. I started making mad bread my ♥♥♥♥♥, mad ♥♥♥♥ing bread. Was buying gifts for my side♥♥♥♥♥ and controlling a ♥♥♥♥ing gang my ♥♥♥♥♥. Not to mention how big I was getting, After those japs got beat my turf was invaded by ♥♥♥♥ing ninjas. yeah ♥♥♥♥ing ninjas my ♥♥♥♥♥, I dont even know.  So naturally my ♥♥♥♥♥ I bobbed and weaved and haymakered them back to the ♥♥♥♥ing sengoku period my ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nAfter establishing my turf my gang was nortorious and was feared amongst all other gangs.  I started beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of other gang bosses like the punk ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥es they were my ♥♥♥♥♥. It was finally time to get invited to the island and fight in one last tournament. I was feeling good my ♥♥♥♥♥, the strongest I ever been, with more bread fame girls and drugs. you already know my ♥♥♥♥♥ I was ♥♥♥♥ing stacked.\n\nSo I go to this island right and have to fight ♥♥♥♥ing subzero from mortal kombat my ♥♥♥♥♥. I was like damn wtf is this ♥♥♥♥, this aint no mortal kombat ♥♥♥♥♥ what you doin? All my lifes hard work and all the pumping of iron has led me here to fight this mofo with a ♥♥♥♥ing ice fetish. Been 420 days and I get absolutely dumpsted by subzero...game ends, game over. worth.\n\nWent from promising young boxer prodigy\nto drunking bar fighter bent on self destruction\nto small time gangster who got arrested\nto prison fight champion and gang leader\nand I got to drink brews and kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of my ♥♥♥♥♥es brother infront of her.\n10/10\n\n\n\n\n\n","January 12","true","20.0"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","12","23","5","4"

You go through this "simulated process" of building your character to becoming a professional fighter; from doing newspaper jobs, delivering pizzas, buying equipment for your house, going to the gym if you don't have enough equipment, buying food, buying Steroids Magic Potions to increase your core strengths... You know what a "from the ground-up" fighter does...\n\nThis game is really grindy because you do go through stat-decay for each day that passes. You really need to work out every day to keep your guy in tip-top shape.\n\nWinning fights allows you to build your character even more giving him your own unique fighting style. (Note: you are unable to control your character during matches, but in-between rounds you can swap out moves to better suit going against your opponent.)\n\nI like this game a lot, but at the beginning it's extremely hard to find a balance between getting your character stronger and getting money to purchase your food. Your ♥♥♥ is going to get handed to you a lot at the beginning, but finding that sweet spot in getting yourself organized makes this game a lot better.\n\nGameplay: 4/5\nStory: 1/5 I really hated the story, like no joke they just mashed a whole bunch of classic fighting game characters and movies and put them into one game.

Its almost 50/50 with both. The artwork is charming, and the gameplay is addictive in shorter-to-medium play sittings. It certainly is challenging - so don't expect something too casual here. Some have compared the difficulty with Darkest Dungeon, and while I wouldn't go that far, its not a bad comparison.\n\nEssentially, you have to balance all of the tedious tasks of life along with training and succeeding in the fighting world. There is a fairly well developed story tree, and lots of upgrades. Everything is well done.\n\nPros:\n+Artwork and animations are all very nice, and well done\n+Price for the game is quite cheap considering the amount of content and fun to be had\n+Definately has an addicting nature\n+There is a fairly deep/complex gameplay system as far as skill trees and storylines, which totally adds on replayability\n\nMeh:\n=Mouse only gameplay, and could be vastly improved (ie. why not use right click to go back in menus??)\n=Music is good - but very repetitive\n=The 90's culture references are nice, but there probably could be more, or they could be left out all together (its a wash for me)\n\nCons:\n-Fights can tend to drag on - it could really benefit from a fast-forward button\n-For how polished it feels and two years in developement, I've found some bugs in the measly 3 hours I've played\n-I thought the developers were native english speakers? I've found a fair amount of grammar and typing errors (I'm certain they were not references, and were unintended)\n-There could be more useful information on the screen, such as a small bit of text in the bottom right corner showing a calendar of when events will be happening\n-Finally, for whatever its worth, I don't care much for the developers, and probably won't follow them too closely\n\nThere was a lot of community uproar during release. I didn't get caught up in any of the hype - in fact I found out about it like a day before it was released. With that being said, I quite enjoy this title and can see myself playing it a good bit.

I loved the idea from the first moment I heard about it, an 80’s/90’s influenced management sim about fighting. It sounded like Streets of Rage crossed with the Sims, to me this seemed like an amazing combination. But in reality I could sum this game up in one simple sentence “Failed to deliver on all the promise it held!” and that would be accurate.\n\nIt would be unfair to say I hate the game, there really is a lot here to like. The visuals are gorgeous and really capture that retro feel, the characters look like who they so often parody and that’s not easy when you choose this 16bit style. The locations are colorful and interesting, again with a huge amount of homages to the films from the 80’s and 90’s.\n\nThe story while hugely cheesy is exactly right, it takes all the best bits of Rocky, The Godfather and many other familiar greats. Whether it be facing off against teenage mutant ninja crocodiles or finding yourself in trouble in little china it’s all here, everything you’d expect and probably lots you’ve forgotten if you were a child of the 80’s.\n\nThis sounds amazing, what could be so bad? That’s probably what you’re asking yourself and it’s something I’ve been asking too, a game with great music, plot and concept could be bad? The answer of course is yes and it really all comes down to execution, you see the game is a huge grind and I don’t mean that figuratively. No, I mean you’ll spend all your time in the gym just to keep your stats up let alone improving them. There’s so much to see in the game but chances are you won’t as one unexpected trip can really put your progress back. If you want to master the game it’s really as simple as train, eat, work and fight, there really is little else if you wish to succeed.\n\nBut it’s a management sim I hear you cry, that’s how they work and you would of course be right. But this game promised so much more, it could have spanned genres and made something amazing. Instead you have very little connection to the main character, not even being able to control them in fights and this is a travesty. A game that’s basis is really about unlocking fighting moves and skills, that gives you zero control of those moves but instead throws them in at random with you left to watch. A frustrating affair and a huge error by the developers if you ask me.\n\nThat of course sum’s the game up, it really wouldn’t have taken a lot to make this a great game. Just make training more effective with less degeneration over time and give the player some control in fights, even if it was just a rock, paper, scissors affair it would have been something. But instead I’ve been left a little deflated at the whole experience, it’s not a terrible game but it’s not a great one. Maybe not even a good one, but passable and nothing more. It’s a shame as there are some great moments here and interesting plot lines, but it’s hard to enjoy as your always planning that next trip to the gym!","February 1","false","23.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's also less deep, if you could believe it, than most kairosoft games. Thus, feeling extremely grindy.\n\nIf they ever rebalance the game or add more content to justify grinding or at least make the grind feel more interesting, it may be worth it to everyone.\n\nUntil that doubtful day, only get this 75% off if you're a fan of kairosoft games and want an imperfect glimpse of that on PC.","January 31","false","12.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zebulan/recommended/394310/","zebulan","Zebulan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zebulan/","824 products in account","Notice: I had been provided a complimentary copy of Punch Club by the publisher, tinyBuild, for review purposes. These opinions are my own.\nPunch Club is a tough sell.  It's that management game you want to absolutely love, but end up scratching your head after.  Part lack of information and part "the entire game is backwards," Punch Club had me wanting more, but with a hope it'll be different.\n\nYou play a hard-up-on-life-and-not-very-smart stereotypical boxer that, for reasons unknown, lives in a city where the economy is absolute garbage.  Make money in the early game by jack-hammering for $50 in an 8 hour shift ($6.25/hour?!) to, in turn, spend $40 of it on two pieces of meat (yes, "meat") to restore your hunger for the day.  Later you end up giving $40 (or more) to your girlfriend to get her to leave you alone (aka: love you for the allowance).  The point being made here, is that the economy is extremely messed up and makes no game-balance sense.  In the late game, you're swimming in money, simply because it comes in daily and at this point: you have nothing to spend in on.\n\nThis is where my main complaint and reservation comes from Punch Club.  The entire game story is played backwards in terms of game balance.\n\nThe start of the game you have absolutely no money, no skills and no friends.  You spend your days training, working and fighting.  In order to train, you spend $10 to use the Gym (each entry; no monthly membership!) until you leave.  You can also buy gym equipment for your garage for a hefty fee of $100 to $300 each piece.  At the end of each day, some of your skills that you just trained, regress.  How great to earn '100 strength' only to lose 40 of it in a heartbeat.  Your fights earn you only experience at the start of the game, not even chump change.  You eventually are given the opportunity to street fight, which also earns you absolutely squat.  When presented the ability to fight in Ultimate fights (underground fight club), it is for money, but only $40 for a win or $20 on a loss.  All the while, you're spending what little money you earn from the two in-game side jobs toward on food to keep on training.  Bottom line, you're hard pressed to find cash to use including your couch cushions.\n\nThen comes "late game," where you've finished the second league.  The entire game flips itself onto its head and pits you into a position where money means absolutely nothing.  All gym equipment is at your disposal, free of charge.  Food is put into your home every day without question.  Matches you fight in give you good money.  Eventually, you earn money daily, just for breathing.  All for what purpose?  This entire stage is focused on you grinding away at training with no distractions in order to become some form of champion, so money has extremely minimal impact on your game play (you may buy energy drinks and give your girlfriend 'go away' cash... and that's pretty much it).\n\nThe game is backwards.  It would have made far more sense if you started in a free gym to help train your lowly character, and put your meagre money toward food where in late game start to pay for more things when money became so readily available.  Instead this very weird "have absolutely nothing to have absolutely everything" pathway causes the early game to take far too many hours than it should and late game to be over so quick you didn't even realize that was the end of the game.\n\nPunch Club itself, as a whole, could have been more fun without the unnecessary grind - it's important to note that without that grind, the game would have been two hours long.  The storyline acts as a distraction while the game takes away your hard earned training to prolong the ending.\n\nWas it fun?  Absolutely.  Balance issues aside, watching your character get pit into tougher challenges with you having very little control over their actions is a great way to build player suspense, happiness and frustrations.  Unfortunately the "fun" is overshadowed by 80% of your time staring at orbs flying into the air due to the overall lack of game balance and story substance.","January 22","false","13.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

Early stages are rough to get through but pays off later on.  It feels very fulfilling to finally beat that one tough enemy that you've spent forever on. The only issue I have is the lack of balance between the 3 skills with the fact that agility completely beats strength and stamina.  Definitely still worth 10 dollars and hopefully these issues will be fixed in the upcoming updates.","January 18","true","10.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It doesn't spoil the game though. I also found the soundtrack to be a little repetitive, but still very good.\nI hope you guys are able to develop expansion packs, DLCs and even a continuation to the game (although I didn't finish it and don't know how it ends).\nMaybe the continuation could be with a more customizable character. My girlfriend loved the game, but was a little disapointed because she couldn't create a female character to play.\nAnyway, it's an excelent game, very fun, beautiful and entertaining!\n\n8/10 ;)","January 17","true","26.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Tasks are repetitive, such as training, buying food, working for money and having fights of all kinds. Wether in the league or elsewhere, you will get points for almost each fight (more for wins), which you can distribute amongst four skill trees. There is the starting skill tree, then there are one for each of your attributes, such as strength, agility and endurance. Each fight is measured in rounds, like boxing matches, during which you can (re)assign abilities to your fighter's available slots (up to 5 i think). Such as all sorts of punches, kicks, defenses or other. Then you watch your guy fight it out over one round and decide wether you want to swap something out or not. The agility build seems to work very well. "skip turn" is easily the most useful ability in the game. I would have picked it up earlier if I knew how useful it was. And lastly "fast reaction" might prove counterproductive, as it wastes your endurance and gives only a slightly better dodge chance.","January 18","true","14.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I thought that it would be a retro action game like Double Dragon or Final Fight with some RPG and Strategy elements mixed in. That's not what this game is at all. You never control your fighter in battle. It's a time management simulator. Turns out, though, it's a really good one!\n\nGraphics are nostalgic. Sound fits well. Pretty funny at times for anyone who has played old 80's or early 90's console games. The balance between keeping your guy happy, healthy, and fit while earning money and advancing his fighting career is great. The difficulty is just right in that you can face setbacks for losing fights, but you still gain skills and advance as you go, so it's not tough to recover. There are lots of side events and quests to engage in, which is great.\n\nReviewers who complain that the main character shouldn't lose skills over time don't understand what this game is all about. It would be very easy to power up and win quickly if skills and conditions didn't degrade. There wouldn't be any time management required or any real game at all.\n\nSo everything is fun for a while. I was hooked for hours. My girlfriend, who doesn't even like fighting games or boxing or anything of that nature, looked over my shoulder for a time and then got hooked and started playing for hours herself. The variety of skills is great, and prioritizing and strategizing for fights is a blast, though the game shoehorning you into one of three fighting styles and not letting you effectively mix and match from each is a minor let down.\n\nSo you're loving the game immensely, then you win a tournament after rising to the top of your league and the game becomes unplayable. Just stop there, enjoy the great experience you had for $10 and be happy. Otherwise, you find yourself in a series of stripped down situations wherein most of the side quests and fights are stopped, all of the time management and side considerations are stripped away, and you just grind out training until you are strong enough to win your next fight. Watching experience bubbles add up for hours on end is terrible and is the opposite of the fun of the early game. Losing skills each day becomes enraging because all you do all day every day is just train those skills up. It's unplayably bad from then on.\n\nThey've been patching regularly and tried to reduce the grind from the end game by giving the player more money, but missed what the grinding part actually is all about. Maybe they'll figure it out with more patches. Maybe not. The early game was worth the ride, regardless.","January 13","true","16.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

You have to pick 1 stat to focus on while maintaining the other 2. The skill tree is great as well. You have to decide what style of fighter you want and upgrade his moves by using the in-game currency.

I beat the game, and was thoroughly addicted the entire time. I've tried multiple chars and builds. That being said, there is a lot wrong with this game.\n\nIt's very punishing if you take any time off training because of stat decay. I understand that's kind of how time management games work, is you strive to find a healthy balance. This game however sometimes forces you into situations where you have no choice but to sit there and watch your stats decay because you have to do other things. You just constantly feel like you're being punished.\n\nOn to the topic of skill trees. They are very unbalanced, and some skills (a lot of skills), are just plain bad. AGI based builds are pretty much king, let me tell you, you're going to loathe fighting AGI based opponents who have certain skills, if you're not AGI based yourself. STR based builds are ok, but you really have to work a lot harder at finding that perfect skillset than with AGI. STA based builds are just a joke. Way of Turtle skill tree is just really bad as a primary skill tree. It'd be good as a secondary skill tree if you actually grinded out that much.\n\nI will say the devs have patched a couple of things already to fix some of the complaints, so more fixes for stuff like this will probably be coming, but as of now, that's how it stands. I'm going to recommend this game, but please note the things I said before purchasing.","January 12","true","18.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

So you’re always trying to balance these needs with training and fighting being the 2 most important ones because stats go down every day.\n\nThe training in this game feels fun and rewarding, you’re told to focus on one key stat of training either strength, agility or stamina and in my case I chose to focus on agility so that when you train at the gym or at home you mainly use the equipment that enhances your chosen training stat like the speed bag for agility.\n\nThe fighting in this game in my opinion is really fun to play, every time you participate in a fight you earn experience which unlocks extra fighting moves and stats but you only want to unlock the moves and stats that apply to your chosen training stat.\n\nThis game really pays homage to so many things like the Rocky movie franchise, Fight Club, The Simpsons, Friends, the graphics look like updated Streets of Rage graphics, the sound and music remind me of every great 16 bit game ever made. You’re trainer is called Mick, the local store clerk is called Apu. When he hits on women he says’ “How you doing?”\n\nThere are too many things in this game for me to talk about like the steroid salesman at the sports store or the criminal and mafia dons that you do jobs for and how you can save up money and buy training equipment for your home so you don’t have to spend money to go to the gym. And like your best friend Roy who dies fighting for you and his sister whom you have a thing for and a pet cat who is just too cheeky for his own good.\n\nIt's very rare that I make a review, but this game mattered to me enough that I made one and in the end I really recommend this game, I thought it was fun and addictive, it was nostalgic and endearing to the end.\n\n\nPros:\n-Fun & Addictive\n-Good Skill Tree\n-Plenty of references\n\nCons:\n- Repetitive\n- Hard for beginners\n-Ending is mehhhh…\n","January 12","true","24.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Similar to what you'd find in a Kairosoft game. It is repetitive and grindy as others have stated. However it is about having a plan and strategy. There are perks/skills that will limit how far your skills will degrade at the end of each day. I consider these skills prime ones to get first (have to get other skills to unlock them), however it will allow you to get to 8/8/8 eventually.  The skill system is deep, and I imagine you can play this at least 3 times doing the 3 different trees...\n\nGraphics: 7/10 for SNES style retro graphics.\nMusic: 5/10 for SNES type game, very repititive, could use more variety.\nGameplay: 6/10 It's fun, however it is grindy and not a lot of variety.\nReplay: 6/10 I would like to see all 3 skill sets and how each fighter would play out. My guy is a dodging master with a glass jaw.\n\nOverall 6.5/10\n\nIf you like tycoon type games, and do not mind grindy/repitition you will like this one.\n\nSome Tips below: (note, as of this review i'm 3-4 hours in). Possible spoilers...but not much to spoil in this kind of game.\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrimary stats:\n\nStrength: Damage and HP\nAgility: Hit chance and dodge chance\nStamina: Energy regeneration and damage absorption\n\nFrom what I can tell, you are given a random perk on day 1 (headed to your job the first time).\n\nMick can feed you a certain number of times for free (you have to be poor $0-6 roughly, and hungry). This is helpful in the beginning.\n\nIf you do not carry a lot of $ around, you will never run into bandits from what I can tell (I am on day 51, and only ran into bandits/theives on day 1, which is a set event, 100% chance of happening). Other reviews mention running into bandits/theives and having them take half of your money. I recommend to not earn more than $120 early on.  I concentrated on earning enough for gym ($10) and buying meat (2-3 at $20 each).\n\nSince the gym costs $10 each visit, make sure you go in fully rested and fully fed (or close to it) so you can train longer.\n\nAvoid doing the same excercise/workout non-stop. Best to switch it up.\n\nDo not concentrate on all 3 stats. Base your primary stat on your random starting perk if it affects one more than another.\n\nThe heavy bag in the gym is a good way to raise all 3 stats after a new day starts (as it takes stat points away every single day).\n\nYou can spend $ on training with Silver (gym). $15 or $20. Both earn you 2 tokens to spend on perks/skills.\n\nSome extra thoughts:\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy beginning random perk was "skinny man" or "thin man", which made it easier to dodge, but if I get hit, I take more damage. This forced me into the agility track. I have seen game play videos where a guy got a kicking talent (no negatives).\n\nI am on around day 51 in the game and was consistently winning (75% 85% of the time).\n\nI am now getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me in the main tournament, lost 3 fights straight...and badly. So I have to now concentrate on earning money, other activities to "change it up". By that I mean doing the ultimate fighting bracket, saving up for gym equipment. I feel that bandits/theives won't beat me as easily. I will update this to see how this goes. I'm close to having the perk where I can not lose/go lower than 8 agility (4/4 in rest).  This will help me concentrate on another stat to get it up to around 8-9 instead. Instead of the main tournament, i'm going to spend $ on sparring/punch bags w/ Silver to earn tokens.\n\nStats on day 51 are 5/9/4 (str/agi/stm).\n\n\n\n\n\n","January 9","true","3.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Just stop there, enjoy the great experience you had for $10 and be happy. Otherwise, you find yourself in a series of stripped down situations wherein most of the side quests and fights are stopped, all of the time management and side considerations are stripped away, and you just grind out training until you are strong enough to win your next fight. Watching experience bubbles add up for hours on end is terrible and is the opposite of the fun of the early game. Losing skills each day becomes enraging because all you do all day every day is just train those skills up. It's unplayably bad from then on.\n\nThey've been patching regularly and tried to reduce the grind from the end game by giving the player more money, but missed what the grinding part actually is all about. Maybe they'll figure it out with more patches. Maybe not. The early game was worth the ride, regardless.","January 13","true","16.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The 90s graphics and sound are a nice touch, along with the references to 90s things such as Rocky and the A-Team. The story is nice as well. It also has more depth to it than one would expect with its multiple endings.\n\nThere is also a bit of strategy involved with the training system. You can't simply max out all your stats. You have to pick 1 stat to focus on while maintaining the other 2. The skill tree is great as well. You have to decide what style of fighter you want and upgrade his moves by using the in-game currency. It's challenging, but it makes the game more fun because you're prevented from dominating your way to the top.","January 9","true","8.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

I beat the game, and was thoroughly addicted the entire time. I've tried multiple chars and builds. That being said, there is a lot wrong with this game.\n\nIt's very punishing if you take any time off training because of stat decay. I understand that's kind of how time management games work, is you strive to find a healthy balance. This game however sometimes forces you into situations where you have no choice but to sit there and watch your stats decay because you have to do other things. You just constantly feel like you're being punished.\n\nOn to the topic of skill trees. They are very unbalanced, and some skills (a lot of skills), are just plain bad. AGI based builds are pretty much king, let me tell you, you're going to loathe fighting AGI based opponents who have certain skills, if you're not AGI based yourself. STR based builds are ok, but you really have to work a lot harder at finding that perfect skillset than with AGI. STA based builds are just a joke. Way of Turtle skill tree is just really bad as a primary skill tree. It'd be good as a secondary skill tree if you actually grinded out that much.\n\nI will say the devs have patched a couple of things already to fix some of the complaints, so more fixes for stuff like this will probably be coming, but as of now, that's how it stands. I'm going to recommend this game, but please note the things I said before purchasing.","January 12","true","18.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

So you’re always trying to balance these needs with training and fighting being the 2 most important ones because stats go down every day.\n\nThe training in this game feels fun and rewarding, you’re told to focus on one key stat of training either strength, agility or stamina and in my case I chose to focus on agility so that when you train at the gym or at home you mainly use the equipment that enhances your chosen training stat like the speed bag for agility.\n\nThe fighting in this game in my opinion is really fun to play, every time you participate in a fight you earn experience which unlocks extra fighting moves and stats but you only want to unlock the moves and stats that apply to your chosen training stat.\n\nThis game really pays homage to so many things like the Rocky movie franchise, Fight Club, The Simpsons, Friends, the graphics look like updated Streets of Rage graphics, the sound and music remind me of every great 16 bit game ever made. You’re trainer is called Mick, the local store clerk is called Apu. When he hits on women he says’ “How you doing?”\n\nThere are too many things in this game for me to talk about like the steroid salesman at the sports store or the criminal and mafia dons that you do jobs for and how you can save up money and buy training equipment for your home so you don’t have to spend money to go to the gym. And like your best friend Roy who dies fighting for you and his sister whom you have a thing for and a pet cat who is just too cheeky for his own good.\n\nIt's very rare that I make a review, but this game mattered to me enough that I made one and in the end I really recommend this game, I thought it was fun and addictive, it was nostalgic and endearing to the end.\n\n\nPros:\n-Fun & Addictive\n-Good Skill Tree\n-Plenty of references\n\nCons:\n- Repetitive\n- Hard for beginners\n-Ending is mehhhh…\n","January 12","true","24.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

While the strategy games have been done before, this one makes me feel a little like Mr. Balboa. The gameplay is simple enough, click items on the screen to interact with them, click on a location on the map to whisk away to that location. But the meat of the game takes one deeper and deeper into the world of punches and kicks. There are skill trees that will help you build a fighter that will suit your style (Hit 'em hard and heavy, dodge everything and pummel to victory, and have a ton of stamina). The actual fighting is passive, you choose a number of moves to pull off and the computer does the rest, choosing moves to use based on your stamina. At the end of every round you can make adjustments to your moveset or just get back in the ring. Simple yet with a voluminous skill tree there certainly is a high potential for strategy.\n\nWhile you're not fighting you can be doing other things, like exercising, hanging out with pals, working to make ends meet, buying groceries, and getting into street fights. The strategy here comes from balancing your schedules around your current stats (Mood, Energy, Hunger, etc....) and events that are coming up in-game. A fight usually happens every three days and you must use your knowledge of the opponent you are up against to better prepare. Within the core of the fighting there are three fighting stats that you can raise, Strength, Stamina, and Agility. Higher strength hits harder, higher stamina hits more, higher agility dodges switftly. By working out at the gym you can raise those stats to better prepare you for the fight ahead. Here's the kicker though, your fighting stats will deplenish a little bit at the end of every day. Now, there are skills you can unlock to prevent total depletion from lack of focus in one stat but that's not the whole picture. Once you get further into the game the opponents obviously get harder so you will have to be more cognizant of your training day by day. And on top of that you must keep an eye on your hunger, energy, mood, and everything else; so, no, you can't just train all day. Also, exercising on one machine for too long will wear you out so you must use a different machine for a little while.\n\nOf course, in that world as well as this, money talks and keeps the world spinning. There is a cost to just about everything and the only way you can make money (at least initially) is by taking on side jobs. These jobs also take away your energy and make you hungry and all that so there is that extra wrinkle to the strategy you must employ. All of this to further the story.\n\nYes there is a story to this game and the way you progress it is by completing objects found in a story tree. It's really a rather clever way of conveying progression to the player. While not every objective is made known right off the back, you can get a good idea of how every objective ties into the narrative. You simply are a man whose father was killed a long time ago and he now is trying to get ahead doing what he loves, fighting. It all starts off innocently enough but suddenly you can take performance enhancing drugs and take part in illegal street league fighting (which could seriously injure you so be wary of that). I admit I haven't had the time to progress too far in the story but what I have seen is interesting and leads me to want to see more.\n\nI need to discuss the art style. It's great. The pixel SNES era graphical style is pleasing to the eyes and looks like they gave a damn in building the world of Punch Club. Being a huge fan of that graphical style I can't praise it enough. Really, that's about it. It's great. There's a retro look option that makes the game look even more pixely. But enough of that.\n\nHow about the sound? The 8bit style sounds complement the game nicely and the chiptune style soundtrack keeps me pumped and thinking my initials are R.B.\n\nFinally, worth noting, while the game has a more serious tone, there are little bits of humor that interject their way to the player. There's some clever humor here and the understated style of delivery makes it that much better.\n\nSo what, you still need more convincing? If you like strategy heavy games and schedule balancing time management playstyles (is that a thing? Maybe......) then by all means give it a play. You won't be disappointed.","January 14","true","1.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

There's already a trainer funded for it by the guys over at Cheat Happens, so what does that tell you about how poor and unfair the mechanics are? This game is bull-♥♥♥♥ on so many levels.\n\nEven though the game is a sandbox style game where it advocates you can pretty much do anything you want at any given moment, whether it be work, sleep, eat, train or go fight... The developers force you in to a specific regimen and boring cycle of doing the same ♥♥♥♥ every day so you keep your character balanced.... or should I say, under powered?\n\nThey charge you 10 dollars every time you want to enter the gym... not per day, every time you ♥♥♥♥ing walk through the gym doors to go train... You can only do so much because of a ridiculously limiting stamina / hunger bar... If either one runs out, you can no longer do anything unless you fullfill the requirements to fill the bar back up... So either eat or sleep...\n\nThe problem comes with money... You earn money by grinding out jobs... Everything is automatic in this game, including the fighting and there's no way to speed up the process... You have to painstakingly watch this stupid bar fill before you get paid, or do anything, just sitting there watching your life pass by... However if you gain too much money, like say over 200 measly dollars, the game automatically runs a script where you get mugged if you try to travel between locations...\n\nThe robbers steal 50% of your cash so you basically have just enough money to go buy food to keep your character alive and start over from strach again. If at any point you earn over 200 dollars, the game runs the same script and you're forced in to a fight you can't win because your character is too weak to fight the assailant... why would I start training when I could just grind cash, buy gym equipment and ♥♥♥♥ing work out from home instead? This game is re-tar-ded.\n\nI tried for 40 days to earn enough money to buy gym equipment so I could work out from home but the game kept robbing me of my cash every time... It's not even a randomized event, it's literally a fail safe mechanic for smart people who exploit the crappy game mechanics, even though it's part of the game to buy gym equipment for home usage.... talk about a troll move on the developers part.\n\nThis game is shoddy and cheap... It looks and sounds fun but it's such a frustrating mess and a waste of time to even bother with... I can't wait to hack this pile of crap and destroy it the sensible way by being smart about how I train in a freaking sandbox game that I can't even do what I want in...\n\nI want to play the game MY way, not your way... Get f'd whoever designed this pile of garbage... I hope you get hit by a truck and die a painful slow death... @$$wipe... You don't deserve to succeed in the gaming industry with B.S. garbage game mechanics like this.","January 8","false","9.0"," 27 of 54 people (50%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","50","27","54","12","1"

And now they've sold 200K copies in the first month, and people love their game, and they are already dreaming of the next original title. At under $10, this game delivers the atmosphere of the 80s.

There's already a trainer funded for it by the guys over at Cheat Happens, so what does that tell you about how poor and unfair the mechanics are? This game is bull-♥♥♥♥ on so many levels.\n\nEven though the game is a sandbox style game where it advocates you can pretty much do anything you want at any given moment, whether it be work, sleep, eat, train or go fight... The developers force you in to a specific regimen and boring cycle of doing the same ♥♥♥♥ every day so you keep your character balanced.... or should I say, under powered?\n\nThey charge you 10 dollars every time you want to enter the gym... not per day, every time you ♥♥♥♥ing walk through the gym doors to go train... You can only do so much because of a ridiculously limiting stamina / hunger bar... If either one runs out, you can no longer do anything unless you fullfill the requirements to fill the bar back up... So either eat or sleep...\n\nThe problem comes with money... You earn money by grinding out jobs... Everything is automatic in this game, including the fighting and there's no way to speed up the process... You have to painstakingly watch this stupid bar fill before you get paid, or do anything, just sitting there watching your life pass by... However if you gain too much money, like say over 200 measly dollars, the game automatically runs a script where you get mugged if you try to travel between locations...\n\nThe robbers steal 50% of your cash so you basically have just enough money to go buy food to keep your character alive and start over from strach again. If at any point you earn over 200 dollars, the game runs the same script and you're forced in to a fight you can't win because your character is too weak to fight the assailant... why would I start training when I could just grind cash, buy gym equipment and ♥♥♥♥ing work out from home instead? This game is re-tar-ded.\n\nI tried for 40 days to earn enough money to buy gym equipment so I could work out from home but the game kept robbing me of my cash every time... It's not even a randomized event, it's literally a fail safe mechanic for smart people who exploit the crappy game mechanics, even though it's part of the game to buy gym equipment for home usage.... talk about a troll move on the developers part.\n\nThis game is shoddy and cheap... It looks and sounds fun but it's such a frustrating mess and a waste of time to even bother with... I can't wait to hack this pile of crap and destroy it the sensible way by being smart about how I train in a freaking sandbox game that I can't even do what I want in...\n\nI want to play the game MY way, not your way... Get f'd whoever designed this pile of garbage... I hope you get hit by a truck and die a painful slow death... @$$wipe... You don't deserve to succeed in the gaming industry with B.S. garbage game mechanics like this.","January 8","false","9.0"," 27 of 54 people (50%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","50","27","54","12","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowforks/recommended/394310/","shadowforks","ShadowForks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowforks/","291 products in account","VIDEO REVIEW COMING SOON\n\nPunch Club, an Indie RPG Boxing game concocted by the enduring creators at Lazy Bear Games, and published by tinyBuild, initiates the players will to fight by showing the main character’s father get shot before your very eyes.  Promising to train hard and reclaim his legacy, the player will regulate the main character’s training while hitting the gym, buying groceries, doing his day-job and even beating up mutant reptiles in the underground sewers.  All of this will raise the player’s boxer to the highest string of fighters, eventually becoming the best of the best, but first he’s got to get knocked down a few times. The story in Punch Club is the perfect juxtaposition of boxing movies like Rocky, and martial arts movies like Ip Man.  The connection to family, friends, and mentors all encourage the journey to become a better fighter and finding what you fight for.  It may sound cheesey, but the story is endearing and easy to get behind if not taken too seriously.\n\nWith its meticulously designed sprite-work, boasting smooth animations and detailed character models and environments, Punch Club exercises a great visual style.  While the independent market of video games sometimes leans on the nostalgia of gamers, creating a pixel based game to cut down on costs.  Punch Club does this to retain its story and style, it feels and oozes the time period it’s trying to represent.  Similarly to how Hotline Miami was a fever dream of VHS and 16-bit violence.  Punch Club’s approach to style is producing a feast for the eyes with it’s artistic creativity of the past with the technology of the present.\n\nWhen I think of good training montages, I think of the perfectly behaviored music that was attributed to said scene.  And when Punch Club is almost half of the time a training montage, you expect it to have some awesome and memorable music.  The music is similar to Punch-Out’s music, very energetic and adrenaline offering.  And similarly to its artstyle, the design of the soundtrack is merely giving tribute to the great anthems of the past while being something fresh and new.\n\nThe game could be described as almost entirely pointing and clicking.  You click on tasks, and micromanage activities on how the main character uses his time.  Punch Club is a maintenance game, a game about choices.  You won’t ever directly throw a punch with a controller. Instead you try to maximize the clock by choosing what your boxer should do.  Should he get a bite to eat?  Which job should he do?  Which stat should I invest in? and Which fight moves should I use on my opponent?  are going to be a few of the many questions you’ll ask yourself while playing Punch-Club.  The stats are Stamina, Strength, and Agility and they all correlate to how you will play the game, resulting in many different paths you can take and guaranteeing an abundance of replayability.\n\nWith this much ceaselessness of entertainment and quality, Punch Club is the perfect game if you’ve always enjoyed fighting movies.  With multiple endings it strives to be in your library for the mere 10 dollars it asks of you. Minus a divisive publicity stunt relating to Twitch viewers having to beat the game in order to release it early.  Punch Club is a great management sim.  But it may not be for everyone, if you enjoy constant action this isn’t the game for you.  But if you enjoy watching solid governing, executing strategic skilltree sets, and seeing the fruit of your labors as the bodies go limp for the count.  Punch Club doesn’t only win the round for you, it TKO’s you with a single punch.\n","January 8","true","0.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Unfortunately, I do not. What really kills the game for me, is that you have no control over the fights. If you could actually throw punches, and kicks, and dodge in the game I would've been thrilled, but all you really do is select which moves your fighter does and hit fight and let the computer randomly drive you crazy by getting punched in the face repeatedly. I thought they did a very good job with the humor, and the retro feel to the game and if you could actually fight I think the game would be great, but you cannot so I give this game a thumbs down. Go out and buy a bottle of cheap rum for that 10 dollars and pass on this one, youll be glad you did and youll have much more fun with the rum.","January 8","false","1.9"," 27 of 55 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","27","55","0","0"

I didn't finish the game. Why? SO MUCH VERY ULTRA GRIND. The game at its current state is unbalanced.\n\nSo let's examine the facts:\n\nThe Good\n+ Suprising depth and a lot of builds to choose from for your character\n+ Inspired by every 70s-80s-90s fighting movie combined\n+ Humor\n+ Retro graphics/Pixel Art\n\nThe Bad\n- Retro graphics/Pixel Art\n- Extremely unbalanced\n- So much grind...\n\nWhat does "extremely unbalanced" mean? It means that some builds are making the game pretty easy when others punish you relentlessly. If you want easy, Agility is the way to go. But I wanted to create a tanky, powerful fighter so I invested in strengh. At first it was really hard to compete with other fighters so I grinded through and actually made it to the second half of the game (Mansion). That's where the game became unplayable.\n\nEvery day that passes you lose some of the attributes you have increased through training. During the second half, the daily losing ammount was making the grind unbearable. In order for this game to be enjoyable the following changes must be made:\n\nReduce the time passing during training\nReduce the daily losing attribute amount\nNerf Agility\n\n\nThe Verdict\nIt could be a fun game but it's unbearable at its current state. If the devs rebalance it in the future I will give it another chance and reformat my review accordingly.","January 16","false","6.6"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","14","29","0","2"

Its quiet amusing to find Jay and Silent Bob, The Ninja Turtles, or join the Fight Club and so on and on and on. The graphics remind me of the old days when i was a kid and games were made to have fun, this is one of the games where you can have plenty of fun with.\n\nPro´s\n- Fighting System is fun (not to long like some say)\n- Always something to do with your char (develop a rota, fight, train, train/fight, fight, tran...)\n- Massive Skill trees which can develop a feeling for the char you play\n- Managing your char is medicore difficult, in the beginniny you need to understand the dynamics and go from there.\n- Ingame Manual and Explanations are simple and sufficient\n- Retro Graphics and Soundtrack :) nice love it\n- 7.2 hours played so far 9.99 payed - so good value time/money\n\nCon´s\n- Would like to invest in the house and pro gear, but have to go to the gym instead\n\n\nIf you like retro games, the 90´s and want to spend some easy going fun hours i guess this game can keep you for 40+ fascinated and atleast 2-3 runs with different chars just to try the different styles, boxer, ultimate fighter, asian style etc.\nThe reviews about the stats crippling etc. can be ignored, they just play wrong.\n\nStarting Guide "Boxer"\n1. Pick 2 Attributes suting what you want to do will pick the Boxer Strength/Constitution are his skills, keep them at same level, leave agility to 4 and lock it via skill.\n1.1 Dont do more then 2 times construction work you dont want to get robbed, buy 4 meat from it and start train, sleep circle - repeat\n2.

I meant to pop it on for 30 minutes just to check it out for myself, and almost 3 hours later I'm telling myself "ONE last fight! Wait no, ONE last day of training and building my stacks!" trying to pry myself away to grab a bite. Part point-and-click adventure like Quest for Glory, part trainer-manager game like the Monster Rancher, and filled with tons of clever references that play upon nostalgia in an entertaining way.\n\nI've looked over some of the negative reviews, and I see that there's some serious complaint about things that I think the players simply don't understand. First off, you can get some free meals at the start if you are hungry and broke, so it isn't as desparate a grind as people make it out to be. Second, there's more than one way to make cash, but there's risk-reward to manage in maintaining attributes while being sure you have the fuel to work and train. The last tip I'm going to offer is not to ignore the push-up mat. Get those delicious gains every day, its the best attribute builder you'll have short of hitting the gym or expanding your personal gym to train at. But the majority of the negative complaints that I see definitely appear to be folks who simply don't understand the game, lack the experience to play a career manager type game effectively, or the lack of patience for the style and pacing of the game.\n\nOh... and for the Steam review rules, I have to mention that yes, I was provided a review key from the lovely folks at tinyBuild, though it was definitely on my radar to buy anyway. :D: Thanks again!","January 10","true","13.5"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

The story totally could've been interesting, but it's lacking a lot of events in between, not to mention that you're so busy trying to survive the stat reduction you might not even have time to do them. There's just SO. MUCH. GRIND. Everything in the world is against you; the random robbers event, the daily stat reduction, the ridiculous cost (probably dumped tens of thousand dollars into that god forsaken gym just to train and spar; how the hell is Silver not a billionaire already?), consumption rate, travelling time (somehow, the protagonist takes a full hour to walk ONE KILOMETER ONLY) and so on and so on.\n\nIn fact, I just don't see the point of playing through the game again with a different skillset - or as bad guy, which offers slightly different storyline and unlockable locations - because it took me 9 hours of crazy grinding - the end game actually features even WORSE, INSANELY REPETITIVE grinding, if you can actually believe it - to finally beat the game. The ending isn't even satisfactory; it leaves you with a cliffhanger and a storyline that confuse the hell out of people, and naturally there's no option to replay that particular cutscene because this is a 'retro' game. Uuuuuugh.\n\nAlso, someone mentioned in the discussions that this game is built around the concept of mobile F2P. I can see it, except that if it actually was F2P I would toss it out of the window in a milisecond. Even ZENONIA isn't as boringly grindy as this game, and that one's a KRPG.\n\nAs of now, I seriously cannot recommend this game to anyone. Yes, it can be fun. Yes, a core part of such sim games is to grind. But jesus, at least Sunrider Academy has boobs to look at (although that game's grind is even more pointless, at least it doesn't PHYSICALLY DISGUST ME WITH ITS MECHANICS). Heck even Love Dating Sim, a game since the 2000s EASILY trumps this game in terms of replayability and sheer fun. This one's just TEDIOUS, UNPRODUCTIVE WORK. I would play Pro Gamer Manager, an early access game with no end game over this.

There is no choice during the actual fight, you don't tell him when or how to use the skills you selected, it's all just random dice rolls as to what he will do next.\n\nThe rest of the game focuses on having to slave at a boring job to get money for food, you basically just watch a bar go up and get money when it's at the top. Other then that you also have to work out to get your fighters stats up, this is as simple as choosing what training implement to use for different stats and then watch as he repeatedly goes trough the same animation untill he doesn't want to do that specific training anymore and you have to click on another implement.\n\nThis is one of those weird games that takes things away from you the further you get into it. After a while you won't have to worry about working or shopping for food as it is provided for you. You also get a home gym so you won't have to leave the house for training. So it basically boils down to watching your fighter work out 95% of the time and then having a fight once in a blue moon. Aparently pro fighters don't fight as often as the rookie ones.\n\nThere is also sub plots like a love interest. But it all basically boils down to click something and watch. Click girlfriend, click chat, watch him stand there akwardly flexing his muscles while he talks and gets his relationship up.\n\nThe games artstyle is retro and looks good for a retro game. However there is very little originality in the sense of humor or area design. It's all just one screen for each area and every last area is filled to the brim with pop-culture references and memes, no actual creativity or originality went into constructing the characters or the world.\n\nAll in all, I'd say don't buy it, don't play it, unless you enjoy sitting motionless watching boring sprite animations for hours on end untill you have enough stats to beat the next fighter.","February 7","false","22.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

It's marketed as a game where "it's all in your hands" where you can create the fighter you want, but unless you're making a very specific karate-kicking Agility build you will lose. This isn't sour grapes, this isn't "wahhh the game isn't holding my hand", this is a fact. My character has 8 strength, 4 Agility and 6 Endurance, and I am regularly being beaten to a pulp by guys who have half my stats because of the way the stats scale with one another. It is also worth mentioning that unless you are training your stats 100% of the day, you will lose probably half your gains due to daily stat decay, which I see as blatantly padding the length of your game.\n\nAlso, there is a mechanic where if you're carrying more than $200 dollars on you you WILL get attacked by a mugger who is programmed to be statistically superior to you. You will eventually reach a point where you can beat him, but by that point you don't really need the home gym equipment you saved up for... all of which cost more than $200.\n\nWith time it could be pretty fun, because the skill trees are long and in depth and boxing/fighting managing games are very rare, but it's a mess right now. Here's hoping that they patch it up so that it's actually fun and you can complete it in multiple ways.","January 9","false","9.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

You start out trying to avenge your father's death by recovering the Medallion he gave to you and your brother. Along the way you gain allies and rivals as you build yourself up to being a true Contender.\n\nPros: Great 16-bit looking graphics and music. The music was catchy and the fights remind me of an elaborate game of rock-paper-scissors. Managing all the aspects of your career (money, health, stamina, hunger, strength, agility, and stamina) is challenging and you really need to think about what you are going to prioritize. The game has some replay value as you'll probably find your second run through MUCH easier than the first. The game also takes place over several locations, allowing a change of scenery. Looking back after my initial start there are several 'mercy' options available if you get 'stuck'.\n\nCons: The game can be extremely grindy. Each day your stats automatically go down, so you're constantly having to train to keep them up. The only thing that really 'stays' are your skills/perks. Losing fights can be a major setback, requiring long periods of re-training and recovery. Running out of money and being too hungry/tired to work can be a pitfall for some players. These can be circumvented, but it tends to nudge the player toward min-maxing in order to ensure a smooth progression.\n\nOverall it is a really fun game, and definitely worth $9.99 . I'm really looking forward to future balancing by the devs, to make a great game fantastic.","January 10","true","15.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pvt_Booger/recommended/394310/","Pvt_Booger","Pvt_Booger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pvt_Booger/","68 products in account",""No Pain!" - "No Pain."\n\nFew millenials, reluctantly or not, will fail to remember Rocky's metaphorical ascension in the famed "steps" scene, catapulting viewers into Avildsen's diegetic spatio-temporal struggles. A seemingly simple character study, a mise en scène which was to resonate throughout subsequent decades and rarely grow passé. Yet, gentle readers may be wondering what my exposition has to do with this rather more purposeful Tycoon, and caustic "2.0 children" may be neurotically snapping into a "Ur an idiot, lol *spout 21st century expletives and bile*."\n\n\nPunch club provides a glimpse into those very struggles, and it makes sure you feel the pain too. Though at heart belonging more to the Tycoon-management genre, it blends elements of a character-driven romp and point-and-click adventure into a delightful miniature, one worth picking up despite the evident frustrating elements. A frustration by design, one that is intended; no success story is that simple, and rewards are sweeter if obstructed by seemingly unsurmountable obstacles.\n\nThe game's 80s cultural references do not stop here though, as it brings up a melange of tropes from a variety of mediums, including quoting video games in truly post-modern fashion, and it melds everything into a savoury broth spiced up by an appropriate measure of comedy. To TL;DR you; it's got Rocky, Big Trouble in little China, Sub-Zero and will make you laugh.\n\n"How does it play?" You may ask. "As frustratingly as reading this adjective-peppered review" I may answer. In fact, I just did. The formula is "work-train-eat-sleep" and looking at bars filling up while you gain stats isn't fun, but once your character starts growing the sense of accomplishment is strong. The choice of skills and skill trees makes for enough variety in builds, despite some players indicating broken mechanics, and replayability is strong. Not to mention that watching your "end-product" knock everyone out in trainwreck fashion gives an evident sense of pride, like your grand-oeuvre is complete.\n\nThere is little pretense in "Punch Out" and it is evident that a lot of care and work has gone into the core mechanics, and the story is not half bad despite being slightly confusing. To a superficial and dismissive observer it may look like it underlies clandestine micro-transaction mechanics, perhaps initially conceived to quench the thirst of mobile-platform whales; but it is not aspiring to be Zynga on PC, serving a dish that is much more deep and complex.\n\nHighly recommended, but not for the faint-hearted.","January 14","true","24.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

I usually enjoy those kinds of games, for example; Game Dev Tycoon and Thrillville are two of my favourite games ever. The key to making a fun tycoon game is achieving the feeling of always advancing and making progress, and having the player overcome and figure out challenges, wants and needs without them feeling like its a 'grind' and/or actual work.\n\nFor the first hour of this game, I was really getting into it. My character who I named 'Joker' was getting introduced to new and exciting characters, game mechanics and overall making solid progress within the game's story tree. I was really enjoying the experience the game was giving to me, from little references that made me chuckle to having me think on my feet and trying to beat my opponent. Sometimes I'd win, sometimes I'd lose. Either way I'd learn from the results of those fights and try better next time.\n\nHowever, the more I went on, 'Punch Club' became more of a chore than an actual fun experience. For starters, one of the game mechanics that really bugged me was the fact that the stats you were improving each day would ultimately get decreased substantially at the start of a new day. This wouldn't bug me as much if the amount of effort I was putting in to improve my stats and skills wasn't a large amount. But it was. Certain gym equipment and gear will boost either one or three of your stats; strength, agility and stamina. However you can only use a certain piece of equipment for a short duration of time during the day before your character becomes tired and drained. This can be a problem as during those training sessions, the amount of points/energy you obtain is only in small increments, and the feeling of getting so close to a new stat rank only for it to be bumped down substantially the very next day is one of complete and utter annoyance.\n\nSome people might have a problem with the fact that the fight simulations are just that; simulations. You don't control the character, instead you select a limited amount of skills and abilities at the start of each round in a match. You then press start and watch as your guy clashes with your opponent boxer. Either getting the upper hand or getting completely demolished. For myself, this wasn't a problem for me, as the challenge in of itself was trying to select the right skills that would successfully disarm and put my opponent at a disadvantage in order for me to grab the win. However the problem I have is the ranking system and how it 'changes'. You could be a day before a match, training hard to boost up stats that will ultimately crush the higher ranking opponent. Only to have on the actual day be challenged by an opponent that is completely different, sometimes even stronger in areas you worked so hard to boost. I hate to be one of those people, but it really does unfair when the game itself pulls a 180 on you at the very last minute.\n\nPositive-wise, the game's presentation is absolutely great! The retro music and graphics really provide that nostalgic feel and give a great feeling when you're simulating matches or just exploring the game's world. And for that side of things, I'll give the developer credit where credit is due.\n\nOverall, while having a great start, 'Punch Club' ultimately falls flat on its face due to the weight of its complexity, to me the objective of a game is to give the player some time away from the tiresome situations of life. I don't want to play a game that ends up making me bored, stressed and even downright annoyed because of its seemingly unfair gameplay.\n\nThank you for reading~\n\nThis is my opinion btw, so don't get worked up over it. I respect people who truly enjoy this game and are having fun, as I wish I could experience what makes the game so great for those people.","January 21","false","4.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Don't get me wrong I really liked the concept but the game mainly consists of non-stop grinding! The first time I played it I bought equipment for my garage but yet struggled to meet ends meet with the highly demanding resource consumption and the constant skill loss making it very difficult to move up the fighting leagues.\n\nI decided to make a new save and focus on "Money" this is what I called my new character.  Everything went smoothly from there, I mean too smoothly in fact. My win rate is 187/196 which is around 96% (all most all of the loses are from endurance fights 1vs6 so they don't really count that much anyway) total up until finishing the game. I completed this game in 11 hours and 105 in game days. however, probably could have done it in less than a 100 (25k in game money). Honestly this game should only take 5 hours at most with the amount of content within it. If you enjoy non-stop grinding at the same tasks like the gym or 1vs6 endurance fights this is a game for you! Otherwise I recommend you avoid it.  All I can say it is a lovely game but the grinding ruins it.\n\nI Hope this review helps.\n","January 10","false","13.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

For myself, this wasn't a problem for me, as the challenge in of itself was trying to select the right skills that would successfully disarm and put my opponent at a disadvantage in order for me to grab the win. However the problem I have is the ranking system and how it 'changes'. You could be a day before a match, training hard to boost up stats that will ultimately crush the higher ranking opponent. Only to have on the actual day be challenged by an opponent that is completely different, sometimes even stronger in areas you worked so hard to boost. I hate to be one of those people, but it really does unfair when the game itself pulls a 180 on you at the very last minute.\n\nPositive-wise, the game's presentation is absolutely great! The retro music and graphics really provide that nostalgic feel and give a great feeling when you're simulating matches or just exploring the game's world. And for that side of things, I'll give the developer credit where credit is due.\n\nOverall, while having a great start, 'Punch Club' ultimately falls flat on its face due to the weight of its complexity, to me the objective of a game is to give the player some time away from the tiresome situations of life. I don't want to play a game that ends up making me bored, stressed and even downright annoyed because of its seemingly unfair gameplay.\n\nThank you for reading~\n\nThis is my opinion btw, so don't get worked up over it. I respect people who truly enjoy this game and are having fun, as I wish I could experience what makes the game so great for those people.","January 21","false","4.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

For me the problem is that the decisions are too spaced out by periods of time where the player is doing nothing, and the gameplay is not interesting enough to make it woth it.\n\nThe most interesting part of the game is configuring your fighter against the oppnenets, and then seeing how that plays out between rounds.  Unfortunately most fights only last a round or two, and you spend the vast majority of time "training", or "working", or running random "errands", none of which are that stimulating.  The emPHAsis is on the wrong SylLABle.\n\nThere also seem to be balance problems between the various builds which punish bad build decisions pretty harshly with no way to discover ahead of time.  Moreover some paths are just better than others.\n\nThis game would do better with more emphasis on the fights, and less time spent managing an eat/sleep/work/training schedule, or at least a way to scheudle and automate it.

This game is, at first glance, very cool.  I like the retro feel, and the concept is pretty solid.  However, I have a lot of problems with it.  At the end of every day, you lose a certain amount of points in all of your skills (Strength, Agility, Stamina).  It's a pretty hefty loss, which makes little sense.  I can see there being a loss if you're not training every day, but it should be a little more forgiving.  Just got your strength up to 7 with an hour to spare in the day?  Well, it's back to six now.  Train more...  Oh, and your other stats dropped too.  It makes the game very boring, and I find that I can't explore the other stuff in the game because I'm constantly trying to A.) Train, B.) Work a job so I can eat food to C.) Pay for the gym and train more.  I really do like the idea of the game, but its way too grindy for my tastes.\n\nThe fights themselves are...interesting.  If you like being utterly dominated by guys with stats far inferior to yours, then you'll have a good time.  I fought a guy with 2/1/2 stats vs my 5/4/5 and he knocked me out in the first round and defeated me in the second.  You'll have a tough time with any fighter whose stats are close to yours, and if they have a stamina score that's at all higher than yours, you can basically forget it.  A fighter with a 2/3/7 will pretty much dominate my 7/4/6.  Granted, maybe I'm early in the game yet and don't have the additional skills all these second rate fighters seem to have (they all have four skills and a perk to my three skills), but it largely seems futile even fighting these guys.  You train and train and train to see your stats inch up almost imperceptibly only to know that the guy you face is likely going to wipe the floor with you despite having inverior statistics.  Your stamina drains way faster than theirs, and once they knock you down, it's a waiting game for them to finish it.  You might have a lot more HP than them, and the fight might start off good for you, but your stamina will soon be in the single digits and you'll be knocked down.  Over and over.  Until your HP advantage is erased and you lose.  Again.

But the flaws just stick out like a sore thumb.\n\nIn punch club, you play as a son to a dad who was shot killed by an unknown, he tells you to do better than what he did. So now you have to take on fighting, and find out who killed your father. The story is decent and he does drive you to find out just what happened.\n\nThe game starts off a little easy, as any game that doesn't require your input. You unlock new places while looking after yourself, working to earn money, eating, sleeping, keeping yourself happy. All while trying to get stronger/quicker/tougher to make sure that the next fights that you do are in your favour.\nHowever, when you do play this, your stat decrease is way too quick, I understand that you can get upgrades so they don't drop below a certain number. But, each upgrade makes the next one more expensive. And it's way too difficult and unfair to make sure that you can buy food to keep yourself nourished. Otherwise, your f'ed. And I know you can get a couple of meals from the guy in the hoodie. But after a while, he refuses. And there is actually a point where you have technically lost. If you can't feed yourself, your doomed. And you have to start the game all over again.\n\nOverall, a poorly made game, can be improved if stat decrease is lowered, I would not recommend this game.","March 9","false","1.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

For me the problem is that the decisions are too spaced out by periods of time where the player is doing nothing, and the gameplay is not interesting enough to make it woth it.\n\nThe most interesting part of the game is configuring your fighter against the oppnenets, and then seeing how that plays out between rounds.  Unfortunately most fights only last a round or two, and you spend the vast majority of time "training", or "working", or running random "errands", none of which are that stimulating.  The emPHAsis is on the wrong SylLABle.\n\nThere also seem to be balance problems between the various builds which punish bad build decisions pretty harshly with no way to discover ahead of time.  Moreover some paths are just better than others.\n\nThis game would do better with more emphasis on the fights, and less time spent managing an eat/sleep/work/training schedule, or at least a way to scheudle and automate it.  The whole thing is a little fat and could use a more rouglike approach with a wider variety in opponents and more replayability with a shorter play time.\n\nJust my $0.02.","January 10","false","9.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

This game is, at first glance, very cool.  I like the retro feel, and the concept is pretty solid.  However, I have a lot of problems with it.  At the end of every day, you lose a certain amount of points in all of your skills (Strength, Agility, Stamina).  It's a pretty hefty loss, which makes little sense.  I can see there being a loss if you're not training every day, but it should be a little more forgiving.  Just got your strength up to 7 with an hour to spare in the day?  Well, it's back to six now.  Train more...  Oh, and your other stats dropped too.  It makes the game very boring, and I find that I can't explore the other stuff in the game because I'm constantly trying to A.) Train, B.) Work a job so I can eat food to C.) Pay for the gym and train more.  I really do like the idea of the game, but its way too grindy for my tastes.\n\nThe fights themselves are...interesting.  If you like being utterly dominated by guys with stats far inferior to yours, then you'll have a good time.  I fought a guy with 2/1/2 stats vs my 5/4/5 and he knocked me out in the first round and defeated me in the second.  You'll have a tough time with any fighter whose stats are close to yours, and if they have a stamina score that's at all higher than yours, you can basically forget it.  A fighter with a 2/3/7 will pretty much dominate my 7/4/6.  Granted, maybe I'm early in the game yet and don't have the additional skills all these second rate fighters seem to have (they all have four skills and a perk to my three skills), but it largely seems futile even fighting these guys.  You train and train and train to see your stats inch up almost imperceptibly only to know that the guy you face is likely going to wipe the floor with you despite having inverior statistics.  Your stamina drains way faster than theirs, and once they knock you down, it's a waiting game for them to finish it.  You might have a lot more HP than them, and the fight might start off good for you, but your stamina will soon be in the single digits and you'll be knocked down.  Over and over.  Until your HP advantage is erased and you lose.  Again. I fought some crocadile in the sewer, had him down to 2 HP, then he basically just kept knocking me down, taking me from over 30 to 0 without me having touched him.  Your fighter will miss all the time, wasting precious stamina, while they nibble at you.  One fight saw them throw 8 unanswered punches at me, connecting with each one.  Sure, I swung at them, but missed.  We had the exact same agility, but your hit probability will almost always be lower.\n\nI think my fighter has a 50% win rate.  Maybe that's the point of the game, but it's frustrating and detracts from a great concept.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoy the concept, but unless you like being constantly frustrated and annoyed, I wouldn't recommend it.

You can unlock every skill in all 4 Tree's if you want, it's not required to beat the game but it's an option for completionists.\n\nYou honestly start out without a clue on what you are doing and you learn as you go just like the Main character.\n\nSome of the enemies are OP, however nobody is unbeatable.\n\nThere's a nice variety of side-quests and fights to do such as fighting Pizza Loving Crocodiles/Aligators that live in a sewer.\n\nHOWEVER I do have to mention that there is SOME luck-based elements in this game. You will feel like a god and then RNGesus will step in and your next opponent will drop a Sick combo on you and destroy you making you smash your keyboard and punch a hole in your wall out of anger.\n\n\nThis is a fairly fun game, and will provide atleast 6+ hours of enjoyment.\n\nAt the moment there really isn't any replay value unless you want to try to beat the game using a different skill set or to beat your old record, maybe for acheivments.\n\n\nI highly reccomend buying this game as it's probably the funnest thing I've played in the last 30 days.\n\n\n\n","January 11","true","15.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

BUT.. it comes with its merits. Accessing menus can be very buggy. I have a habit of using the ESC key to close down menus in games, if you use it in this one, the menu will be come unresponsive forcing you to close the game and reopen it. This has happened maybe 5 times in the hour that i played. Aside from that, it is very grindy. You have to constantly keep up with your stats to stay competitve with other fighters, while also getting rest, working for pay etc. It is an awesome concept, but in the end it just feels like i am doing a chore.\n\nPros\n- Interesting concept that feels fresh to other sim/management type games.\n- Awesome art style/OST\n- Variety of skills from what i could see\n- Satisfying progression system\n\nCons\n- VERY grindy\n- Has some very annoying bugs\n- Reptitive\n-  Lacking in content\n\nThis feels less of a 10$ title and more of a free phone game that should have microtransactions.

You decide when your character works, tains, sleeps eats, fights and so on. Trying to balance when to work for food and training to avoid stat decay while fighting in fighting tournaments. Its very interesting with a lovely art style and intriguing story.\n\nThere is but one problem. The game includes 3 main stats which are linked to 3 fighting styles. Strength to Bear, Agility to Tiger and Stamina to Turtle. These stats and styles are heavily unbalanced. Agility is easily the strongest. The stat affect your chance to hit and dodge as well as having many skills that reduce damage, making your dodge rely more on agility which seems to be an unintended buff while also lowering the stamina cost. As well as having attacks that cost very little stamina and that rely less on strength to do damage.\n\nBear and strength are the middle tier. Increasing Strength ups your damage while also increasing the stamina cost for all your attacks and indirectly lower your chance to hit. The style does a lot of damage but without putting lots of points into agility you have zero chance to win fights against agility opponents due to a very low hit chance.\n\nTurtle and stamina is the bottom of the barrel. Turtle style is a stye meant to be based around, you guessed it stamina and toughness. It increases your health and I believe damage resistance. However in a stamina build you will frequently run out of... stamina. Its attacks have the highest stamina cost and porbably the worst damage. Agility opponents also have many, many skills that take apart stamina builds. Skills that lower opponents chance to dodge or making blocked attacks do more damage or lowering block chances.\n\nAs it is now simply putting all your points into agility and none into strength and some into stamina will allow you to breeze through the game while the other styles requires a much greater struggle. This would be fine if the developers saw it as a problem which they seem not too. Instead they see it as an invisible difficulty option. This is a horrible way to avoid responsibility for making an unbalanced game and makes me think they are unlikely to change anything. Great concept, well executed, horribly balanced.","January 13","false","10.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The first half of the game is where it really shines as a management sim / rpg / glorified rock'em sock'em robots spectator sport.  Unfortunately the last half of the game loses its perspective and just turns into watching numbers go up and down until you get the ones you need to beat the other guys higher numbers taking all of the skill out of it.  If the Devs would lower the amount of points you lose per day and make the game less grindy it would double the fun factor but they wouldnt want people to finish their game in like 2 or 3 hours so they'll never do that.\n\nI will note though that the game is a lesson that to become physically fit and stay in shape you constantly need to train in different areas and make sure not to get complacent just grinding out the same thing.  If you ever go to a gym you'll hear they have things like "Arm day" or "Leg day" you alternate just enough to build on the muscles a day or so prior. If you abscent mindedly look around waiting while your guy trains he will start gaining less and less from doing that activity and use more food/energy doing it. What you need to do is cycle through the whole gym doing a little bit of each to keep the gains high and burning through food and energy low.  This may confuse some people that play the game thinking that its just showing you how much time you have left on that workout, but the developer has confirmed that you are in fact LOSING a percentage of each gained bubble.\n\nI didnt expect this game to try and subtlety try and teach you how to work out effectively. I also didnt expect how damn difficult it is to buy and keep food in the fridge when your also trying to stay the most physically fit for your upcoming fights. You also may have to swap out your abilities mid fight because while your stamina is high the other guy may be doing way waaaay more damage and dumping all your defensive ♥♥♥♥ in order to push for the win is the best course of action,  Each skill tree has something that counteracts the other two so making sure your not taking block when the guy your going up against has something that goes through 40% of your blocked damage. Taking the time between rounds to switch out these things and seeing what works will net you a solid victory and not get your ♥♥♥ whooped.\n\nThis game says to me that to stay still or to put your nose to the grinder is the worst thing to do so to avoid that you need to step back, assess your options, try to keep an open mind and dont get tunnel vision....like a real fighter. A true fighter is not a mindless emotionless thug but a well oiled machine that is more a lifestyle and less a interest or hobby you watch on UFC because everyones on the bandwagon.\n\n\n\nOverall its a fun game for $10 but if you are the type of person who was looking for a deep game that needs constant attention being a fighters coach you would be barking up the wrong tree.  Its more of a Ipad type game that you'd play on the toilet.  As i said at the start if spending days and days grinding out numbers would bore you to tears id steer clear of this game too.  Its a charming casual rock'em sock'em robots game that just needs a hip 80's kid with spikey hair to play it in a commercial.\n\nCan you maintain a life, make a epic montage about being an underdog athlete, and still find the time of day to romance Adrian to become the hero this city needs? thats up to you my friends","January 24","true","24.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bilazaurus/recommended/394310/","bilazaurus","Bilazaurus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bilazaurus/","262 products in account","In short : Addictive and rewarding experience. It’s exactly what it looks like – a retro style from zero to hero story with grind based gameplay with a dose of management. Although monotonous at times, it’s tongue in cheek, stereotypical setting and gratifying level ups will keep you playing to the end which unfortunately is abrupt and disappointing.\n\nIn depth review :\n\nPunch Club revolves around a young boxer wannabe who rises to the top in order to avenge his father, whatever sense it makes.\nYou start as lonely guy living in a small house with his cat and a fishtank. Oh, and you’re broke as hell. After series of mildly interesting events you’re given a chance as a boxer.\n\nThis introduces you to what is core element of Punch Club – training, stats and skills. If you’re familiar with Kairosoft’s mobile “Story” series you’ll probably get the picture.\nThere are three main branches of stats – strength, agility and stamina. The same goes for skills which are divided into a basic set of skills and three advanced, heavily stat-dependent styles.\nIn consequence you can choose to be a lightning fast fighter, sluggish but powerful heavy hitter or a damage soaking tank sponge. But hold on, it gets a little bit more complex.\nOne stat has an impact on another. Example – having high strength and punching hard depletes stamina drastically and low agility will make you more likely to miss. Character progression involves tactic, adequate stat training and carefully selected skills.\n\nYou’ll be spending lots of time on training which can raise your stats or give exp points for new abilities. But there is a twist. At the end of every day you lose portion of your stats so not only you have to improve them but also maintain them. This is tricky as you also have to find time to earn some money, rest and make stops at convenience store to refill your fridge. Punch Club will force you to manage your time, money and boxer’s path. It can be both frustrating and fun.\n\nLet’s go to the meat of Punch Club, fighting that is. As I said before it relies heavily on stats and abilities. That’s because you have no influence on your bouts aside from setting up your skills and training. Fortunately, I must say that I enjoyed watching and cheering my boxer or moaning in disappointment as you normally would watching match on TV. Punch Club’s advantage is also a variety of fighting scenarios. You’ll be boxing in amateur leagues, professional championships but also in a street fights, illegal matches and special events.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that Punch Club has a little more to it than a career – mostly special events. You may fall in love, chill with your new friend, do some dirty work for a mob boss or traditional fetch quests. Sadly, there’s not much to it. They’re trivial, rather short and in small amounts. There’s also a crossroad in the plot where you chose your path but still, final destination Is the same.\n\nWhat seems obvious here is a huge, in-the-face influence of 80’s/90’s culture. It’s apparent in the plot, in side quests, in locations, in dialogue, basically everything has this cheesy, yet very likeable vibe to it. You’ll recognize a lot of references with a mild sense of humor – Rocky, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, TMNT (yup!) – you name it. With graphics resembling NES/SNES or even arcades it really adds to this feeling which is cozy and familiar.\n\nThat’s good and all but there are also some major flaws in Punch Club. It’s short soundtrack will get on your nerve pretty soon as it repeats over and over again. Though gameplay is addicting it’s also pretty repetitive and if you won’t believe the illusion of variety, you’ll get bored easily. What made me especially mad is weak story progression. Was it intended to emulate early action movies or not, it failed to be engaging or compelling. What’s worse, it ends abruptly and ridiculously making me not only disappointed but mad. It’s fun when the ride lasts but the destination makes you wish you never arrived.\n\nCompletion time : 13 hours\n\nThe good :\n\n-	Addictive and fun gameplay\n-	Good 80’s/90’s feeling\n\nThe bad :\n\n-	Disasterous ending\n-	Monotonous music\n-	Rather short\n\nFinal score : 7/10","January 28","true","13.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

You decide when your character works, tains, sleeps eats, fights and so on. Trying to balance when to work for food and training to avoid stat decay while fighting in fighting tournaments. Its very interesting with a lovely art style and intriguing story.\n\nThere is but one problem. The game includes 3 main stats which are linked to 3 fighting styles. Strength to Bear, Agility to Tiger and Stamina to Turtle. These stats and styles are heavily unbalanced. Agility is easily the strongest. The stat affect your chance to hit and dodge as well as having many skills that reduce damage, making your dodge rely more on agility which seems to be an unintended buff while also lowering the stamina cost. As well as having attacks that cost very little stamina and that rely less on strength to do damage.\n\nBear and strength are the middle tier. Increasing Strength ups your damage while also increasing the stamina cost for all your attacks and indirectly lower your chance to hit. The style does a lot of damage but without putting lots of points into agility you have zero chance to win fights against agility opponents due to a very low hit chance.\n\nTurtle and stamina is the bottom of the barrel. Turtle style is a stye meant to be based around, you guessed it stamina and toughness. It increases your health and I believe damage resistance. However in a stamina build you will frequently run out of... stamina. Its attacks have the highest stamina cost and porbably the worst damage. Agility opponents also have many, many skills that take apart stamina builds. Skills that lower opponents chance to dodge or making blocked attacks do more damage or lowering block chances.\n\nAs it is now simply putting all your points into agility and none into strength and some into stamina will allow you to breeze through the game while the other styles requires a much greater struggle. This would be fine if the developers saw it as a problem which they seem not too. Instead they see it as an invisible difficulty option. This is a horrible way to avoid responsibility for making an unbalanced game and makes me think they are unlikely to change anything. Great concept, well executed, horribly balanced.","January 13","false","10.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I can't see the growth stats on equipment after I've bought it, or the stats of *any* of the gym equipment. I can't get a breakdown of my hit probabilities after agility and dodging is factored in. I can't see my total stat values despite it telling me how much I've gained and lost each day.\n\nIf this game was on my phone, I'd probably still punch away at it from time to time because it's a decent enough distraction. As a PC game, it's ultimately a half-hearted and dull experience.","January 13","false","5.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Fights are just stats VS stats instead of something fun\n* Strength builds more difficult to pull off than other builds because high strength is dependant on high stamina so you need to level up both strength and stamina to pull off a good strength build. So you have to grind way more stats than you would for an agility build for example.\n* Awful ending that is ripped straight out of Empire Strikes Back.\n* You never get to actually fight the guy that you grind through the entire game to fight. It pulls off some ridiculous game twist in the story that isn't satisfying at all and left me bitter that all the time i spent training to fight the final guy was worthless because you never get to even fight him.\n* It's ridiculously grindy. It was getting to the point that in order not to lose stats i was grinding fitness stats and just consuming a ton of energy drinks and food just because i didn't want to spend time sleeping and end up losing stats.\n\nI would not recommend this game and as much as i wanted to like this game i ended up finding it a major disapointment.","February 9","false","26.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I haven't put much time into it yet because like many others, I found this game to be more mobile 'game' than game. You train, you lose stats, you retrain over and over. The game isn't really such a thing, unless you just want to play excel sheet trainer. You never actually do anything to affect the outcomes of fights other than slotting abilities and watching your fighter stand in a ring.\n\nIn all honesty, this feels like a mobile game meant for microstransactions to buy things to keep your stats from falling, except even those games have spots where you can tap around on the screen to do literally anything besides travel from spot to spot.\n\nI really do want to like this game. Good sprites, good asthetic, and a good name. The reality though? There's no game to this thing. It's just a RNG machine that you pull the crank on every now and then.","January 29","false","1.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The early- to mid-game is full of different opportunities, which are fun to do, and the character progression is very cool.\nBut when you reach late-game, it becomes very stale, repetitive and tedious. You spend 0,5-2hrs doing the same stuff over and over, to prepare for the fights.\nAnd even if you are prepared well, you have to fight the RNG, too.\nEspecially the late-game-chore and RNG is something, that works against the replayability and made me stop going for all achievements.\n\nThe playtime of a blind playthrough is between 6-8hrs, so pick it up if you find the price reasonable for a single playthrough of that length, because you may not get more out of it.","January 30","false","9.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Many of the times you have this trial and error phase of first playthroughs or the long first one if you're trying to unlock/complete/master the game in one go, are exhausting.  The walking about, text speed, cutscenes, and lack of information on numbers is just frustratingly long/slow/unnecessary.  Great great potential for the story and gameplay if it were tweaked a bit.  Many bugs and glitches are just upsetting, however few there are.  Looking forward to lengthening the game, and juicening up the story/mechanics/endgame or whatever parts to it.\n\nIt's suffering from being a short and sweet game, and a grind, late game, wanting to fight em all kinda game.\n\nDo I want pokemon with memes?  Or do I want a riveting story where the gameplay is efficient and works well to bring about the immersion from earlier all throughout to an astounding finale?\n\nIt falls short between being both and it's just weird.\n\nTry it out on sale or if you really really enjoy an automatic/semi turn based fighter with some cool concepts and artwork.

I must admit, I'm frustrated right now. I honestly prefer a game that isn't too difficult, or one I can just walk through, pretty much.\n\nI'm frustrated because a lot of winning, as of version 1.06 anyway, is pure chance. All my stats for my guy can be 14, combined. The opponent is 10, combined, and yet the opponent wins with ~40% health still available. This has happened several times.\n\nI imagine they will fix this, but right now, it's quite frustrating.\n\nAnother thing is the money making/work out/girlfriend/friend balance. In order to have the "In Love" perk, you need to spend quite a bit of money or time on your girlfriend. Makes sense, but combine that with all the other things you have  to do to progress, the amount of work and, more importantly, time you put in doesn't provide enough of an advantage.\n\nIf I suggest anything... well, it's a request I should say, is I would like a difficulty setting: Easy, Mid, Hard.\n\nThanks for reading.","February 9","false","32.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

Fights are just stats VS stats instead of something fun\n* Strength builds more difficult to pull off than other builds because high strength is dependant on high stamina so you need to level up both strength and stamina to pull off a good strength build. So you have to grind way more stats than you would for an agility build for example.\n* Awful ending that is ripped straight out of Empire Strikes Back.\n* You never get to actually fight the guy that you grind through the entire game to fight. It pulls off some ridiculous game twist in the story that isn't satisfying at all and left me bitter that all the time i spent training to fight the final guy was worthless because you never get to even fight him.\n* It's ridiculously grindy.

One thing though, Agility builds need to be nerfed.\n\nSeriously.\n\nCertain abilities specifically allow an agility build to dodge, avoiding all damage, while dealing a significant portion of the potential damage, back to the attacker.\n\nWhen you play a Strength build this ability will become the bane of your ♥♥♥♥ing existence as you watch spry agile pansies dance around your atomic punches while beating the hell out of yourself because "♥♥♥♥ strength builds" these are not "counters" they are not shown "counter attacking" you just swing, miss, and suffer 40%+ of YOUR potential damage. If it was a counter attack and was based on the strength of the Agility build it would be WAY more balanced, but it isn't.\n\nSure there are some very minor and ultimately pathetic "soft counters" to this like abilities that reduce an opponents agility, but they last for such a short amount of time and are usually so unreliable that by time you get in a decent punch or two you've reduced your own health by half, your stamina is basically gone and you've dealt 20 damage to your enemy who has almost full stamina to reduce their agility for ONE ATTACK!\n\nNah, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nIf your reading this developer peoples... Nerf your ♥♥♥♥ing agility, Because it's broken.\n\nStrength in particular suffers againt agility builds, but Stamina has a hard time against them as well, they're INSANELY efficient to the point where most agility builds never run out of stamina, and dodge EVERYTHING you throw at them while dealing 40% of all that damage back against you.\n\nI know I'm rambling but that's because I just can't understand how the developers thought this was balanced?\n\nIt isn't.","January 21","true","17.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I could go on. You can't directly control your actions in fights but do choose the roster of punches, kicks, block, and dodges you will use in each round of fighting. You gain moves and abilities to use in these fights at a steady pace that manages to be frequent enough for your tactics to be constantly evolving but spread out enough to not let you be bogged down in moves that come obsolete in the next hour of gameplay.  However your levelling is separate from your base stats, which will constantly drop to males spending your time training extra important. This provides the main challenge of the gam as balancing your skills against your needs is difficult however can make the game feel grindy at times, even to people who enjoy working out the most efficient routine.\n\nThe game is full of 80s nostalgia and pop culture references. Even the main story line feels like it's been ripped out of an 80s movie and pays homage to plenty of your favourite movies from the decade. And the graphical style compliment this beautifully.\n\nOverall a very balanced game, with a fun if not batdropping insane story and great visuals. Just can be a grind fest at times. But it's a grind fest worth fighting through. Now, if you don't mind I have to get back to to the speed bag before my energy drops anymore than it already has.","January 21","true","10.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But when I actually got to play it I couldn't bare it for more than an hour and got my refund.\nMy problems with the game were mainly the grinding that got boring and was the majorty of  what you do in the game play , and the literally "forced" plot. Why is forced plot a problem? In theory it's quite good. But when you calculate the exact amount of money and time you want to spend in a place before you go to your house to sleep/eat and insted get transported around the city with *no way* of skipping the dialog or speeding up the text(which just got really annoying the more I played).\nA way to solve it is to let the player choose when to enter the sequance. For example, when you get that wierd suitcase to your house instead of forcing you to start it's event just let me do it whenever I please.\nAnother problem for me was the fact that you can't tell the difficulity of a fight pre-entring it. There is no indication of what level the fight/quest you're going into requires and once you start a quest you can't quit/stop it.\nFor me it got really annoying when the pizza guy gave me a job (special delivery) and when I got to it the fight was unwinable for my level.\nAnd in a game where time investment matters, and thinking ahead about what to do really matters (you can get injured and thus slow your progress for example)  this kind of problems shine and are really, really annoying.\nAnd ofcourse the last and really major problem of this game for me was the money vs. training problem. It really feels unbalanced so that inorder to gain just a little bit of money you need to spend an entire day and then you need to rest in bed, lift your spirit and eat alot(food seems really expansive compared to the money you get). In other words, the "day" in the game is way too short to get money to survive ,recuperate , and train. and most times even two days are no enough which is ridiculous in terms of in-game managment.\nIf all of those things were to be fixed/balanced I'd give the game another chance.","March 10","false","1.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Basically all you do is watch your character train, then watch him fight, then buy skills. The skill tree is somewhat interesting, however you can get all the skills if you grind long enough, meaning your choices only affect how long it takes you to beat the game.\n\nProperly managing your time is important throughout the game but becomes less and less interesting as the game progresses. Early on you have little money and have to manage working, training, sleeping and fighting. Later on all you do is train and fight. You are forced to spend time training as your characters stats decrease at the end of each day. This is especially annoying in the end game because you have to spend large amounts of time watching your character train between every fight.\n\nIf you want to play a fighter management game I suggest any of the Monster Rancher games, They offer a lot of the same sort of systems only done much better.","February 9","false","8.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This would be fine if the game didn't take so long. The lack of a speed-up toggle (to accelerate the 5+hours of total training I did in my 10 hour playthrough) makes this a time sink with an unsatisfying conclusion.\nNo replayability for me because I don't want to spend another 6 hours to get a fully developed character. Even speedrunners would have a difficult time picking this game because 100 days is still about 5 hours due to the training involved (I could see total training time getting around 3 hours if truly min/maxed, but I doubt much lower).\nA cutscene theatre would have been nice since they auto-advance frames and you might miss the text.\nFun music, fun graphics.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcerson/recommended/394310/","mcerson","McErson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcerson/","575 products in account","The actual game is fine enough. A fairly addicting simulation game where you nurture a fighter into a one man ♥♥♥-kicking machine. What let's it down MASSIVELY though is the plot. There is one point in the game where it advances you to a point where all side-quests are abandoned with no warning, which is super annoying. The game does some cool switching up at that point as well, but it's hard to get over the annoyance of the side quest purge.\nI mean, it's not that the side-quests are spectacular or anything. In fact, most of the "missions" in this game are messy at best (including the main story), but they still add some flavour to the repetitiveness of the gameplay, making it feel fresh and giving you something to work towards. For it all to be brushed aside with no warning is not fun.\nBut the real icing on the cake is how abrupt the ending is. Some messy plot points are revealed before cutting to credits with no pay-off or satisfying ending, also leaving no room for post-game.\n\nI like the idea of a story-based simulation game, but the story is crap and pulls you out of the experience the rest of the game creates, making it hard to recommend Punch Club despite enjoying most of my time with it.","January 26","false","10.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Basically all you do is watch your character train, then watch him fight, then buy skills. The skill tree is somewhat interesting, however you can get all the skills if you grind long enough, meaning your choices only affect how long it takes you to beat the game.\n\nProperly managing your time is important throughout the game but becomes less and less interesting as the game progresses. Early on you have little money and have to manage working, training, sleeping and fighting. Later on all you do is train and fight. You are forced to spend time training as your characters stats decrease at the end of each day. This is especially annoying in the end game because you have to spend large amounts of time watching your character train between every fight.\n\nIf you want to play a fighter management game I suggest any of the Monster Rancher games, They offer a lot of the same sort of systems only done much better.","February 9","false","8.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I was pretty excited for this game too, but sadly the game just has too much working against it and it tends to ruin the experience for me. Pretty much, every issue stated in other "Not Reccomended" reviews are completely, and sadly, correct.\n\nThe mechanics of the game works like this; You train for fights, the skills degrade every day, you fight, and in between that time you try to do everything to not go hungry. That would mean that you must work. Then you have to also monitor a; romantic relationship, pit fights, bar fights, being a super hero, and every-other thing outside of the basic mechanics of the game. Sounds great in concept, too bad it is poorly excecuted.\n\nThe main gripe, and the one that would fix a ton of these issues, is the skill degration. It is brutal and combine that with all the extra-cirricular things that you need to do and somehow manage to not go hungry, and you can imagine how dishearteningly grindy this game is. You work to try to get your skills up, well good luck with that; if you're hungy/tired, you need to stop, if you are low on money you need to stop, if you need food you need to stop, if you want a romantic relationship you need to stop, if you want to be a super hero you need to stop. All these things slows down your ability to train. But don't worry, the minute a day passes, you loose half of all the stats you've tried to gain beforehand.\n\nIt becomes a depressing fight upstream to even get decent skills in this game. You can't really progress to the fun bits when you're having to deal with this soul-crushing uphill battle. This, sadly, becomes worse when you have to deal with the actual "fights".\n\nI say "fights" as there really aren't fights you can totally control. I get the idea behind it, but the strategy goes out the window when your higher stat fighter, proceeds to just stand there and take punch after punch, and kick after kick.  And it's not like this happens every once in a while. It happens in every fight. Honestly, I would rather just have control over my avatar. Either that or just not have the fight portion and just act like the cornerman/head trainer and just give strategy/instructions to the avatar. I don't know how many times I had rage-quitted this game because of the fact that my avatar would not do a damned thing while I just sat there yelling at him to do anything other than take punches/kicks to the face! Again, this would just have been alliviated if the player had control over the character.\n\nAgain, it's not like I hate this game. In fact, I really want to like it. The art style and the vibe of the game would make this a pretty fun game. Sadly, it's like this game is fighting me every step of the way to make me like this game. It needs to be patched, but I sadly don't see them making one anytime soon. I guess that means that this game is going to be gathering virtual dust in my Steam library.\n\nIf I wanted to end this review with something for any reader to remember, I guess I would say to not get this game. It's depressing. It's depressing in how the mechanics just suck the life out of a potentially fun game experience, and it's depressing in how you have very little control over the more important part of the game, the fighting.","March 13","false","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can't drive it, I think its property of some neighbor or something...\nWell, this game is not for everyone. It simulates life in many aspects. Like Rock Balboa said:\n"It ain't about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward!"\nYou gonna find many situations where you get stuck in life, you can't progress in the amateur league because you are not in a well shape, you are not in a well shape because you don't have time to train, you don't have time to train because you need to work, you need to work because you have to eat and you have to eat to do anything.\nAnd your stats decrease every day, so you have to train everyday if possible.\n\nWhen this happens you need to prosper, stop fighting for a week or two and gather food in your fridge, work everyday in a boring job and then starts the training and train hard. Then, you gonna be stronger and advance in history.\n\nThe game actually tells your many times to focus on one build, you dont have to do this, you NEED to do this. Every single one perk point misplaced is a lot to work to cover the mistake in the late game. And if you choose the muscle memory perk using stamina or agility build is game over, better start another character, because you will lose every fight because you will not have the energy to hit and endure enough rounds.\n\nThe history is not rich, the gameplay is not much fun, but this game feels satisfying, I guess its the reward to look what you've been through, how hard you trained, to win a fight. The graphics are the best of the best. 2D is my love anyway. The atmosphere is awesome.\n\nThere are some improvements which would help the game a lot, like actually choosing your outfits, buying outfits, different transports, more musics, more moves, more places, more story and anything that would help the game to not be boring.\n\nI recommend this game to people who are looking for some different aspects in games. I've been playing games everyday of my life since my 5 years old, I am in a phase of my life that I play games which feels relaxing and offers something else than just play.","January 22","true","16.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ataide/recommended/394310/","ataide","Bowser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ataide/","233 products in account","A rewarding game!\nIn this game you start as a orphan living in a couch with your cat and your flower in your humble house with a tv, a fridge and in the garage you have a carpet to do some pushups and an amazing van! You can't drive it, I think its property of some neighbor or something...\nWell, this game is not for everyone. It simulates life in many aspects. Like Rock Balboa said:\n"It ain't about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward!"\nYou gonna find many situations where you get stuck in life, you can't progress in the amateur league because you are not in a well shape, you are not in a well shape because you don't have time to train, you don't have time to train because you need to work, you need to work because you have to eat and you have to eat to do anything.\nAnd your stats decrease every day, so you have to train everyday if possible.\n\nWhen this happens you need to prosper, stop fighting for a week or two and gather food in your fridge, work everyday in a boring job and then starts the training and train hard. Then, you gonna be stronger and advance in history.\n\nThe game actually tells your many times to focus on one build, you dont have to do this, you NEED to do this. Every single one perk point misplaced is a lot to work to cover the mistake in the late game. And if you choose the muscle memory perk using stamina or agility build is game over, better start another character, because you will lose every fight because you will not have the energy to hit and endure enough rounds.\n\nThe history is not rich, the gameplay is not much fun, but this game feels satisfying, I guess its the reward to look what you've been through, how hard you trained, to win a fight. The graphics are the best of the best. 2D is my love anyway. The atmosphere is awesome.\n\nThere are some improvements which would help the game a lot, like actually choosing your outfits, buying outfits, different transports, more musics, more moves, more places, more story and anything that would help the game to not be boring.\n\nI recommend this game to people who are looking for some different aspects in games. I've been playing games everyday of my life since my 5 years old, I am in a phase of my life that I play games which feels relaxing and offers something else than just play.","January 22","true","16.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With the thrown in references and characthers, really apricaite the reference to Snatch btw, this game held my attention threwout the entire experience. A first playthrew of this game will take you 10-12 hours, but if you get so caugth up in seeing everything it has to offer like i did you can easily add another 8 hours with a second playthrew. With the Dark fist stuff as well you add yet another 3 hours, so you get a lot of game for this price.

For instance, the objects you can buy at the store and at the supermarket are ridiculusly limited.. towards 3/4 of the game you end up with a huge bank acount and don't know where to spend all that $$.\nA good thing would be, for instance, giving a chance to the player to personalize the game avatar, the house, the equippement... I found it a bit poor under that point of view, It would be great for it to be richer also in the storylane, would be great if openended.\n\nOverall I really enyoed the game, so it's a positive and I do recomend it!\n","April 13","true","19.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But why can't 10 dollars mean fun?\n\nSo, assuming you made the right decision and chose agility over all else you are more than likely dealing with the repetitive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and continuously depriciating stats, meant to emulate actual body building in an almost delightful ironic twist.\n\nBut I have fantastic news!\n\nThis game is written in c# and is running on a very basic engine.\n\nAfter spending 7 hours playing through this awful pendatic game I realised that it was written in c#\n\n\nso I just memory edited the game to max stats, which only slightly improved the game in that I no longer had to deal with their deteriorating stat system\n\nIn the year of your lord and saviour Jesus Christ, 2016AD,  people still haven't figured out that proper challenge isn't about forcing the player to go through constant troublesome ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to advance at EVERY stage of gameplay?\n\nGod bless you if you had the time and patience to deal with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mechanics that railroads you into a recursive stat building system where you head from level 8 to 6 so quickly it'll make your head spin, or better yet get an injury after losing a fight making all progress you had made over the last 2 hours null and void until you can afford to go to a doctor.\n\nPersonally I just took the easy way out and fixed the game by getting rid of the stat loss every day, because really who even thinks this is a good idea in any way?\n\nOverall, when you look past the lackluster combat system, glaring plotholes, (SPOILERS: your future dad killed your past dad and you had a brother that was never introduced until the very end of the game, wherein you summarily kill him because he wanted to get the magic amulet that CONTROLS TIME. This is all explained within 2 minutes and then pushed off to the side as if never having been brought up in the first place. Oh and then credits roll after the reveal because the game ends before a final fight with dad! I smell DLC to wrap up the story for the BASE GAME, yummy!), and repetitive soundtrack you get a soggy lump of ♥♥♥♥ that was clearly made in less time than it takes to lay out a fat slimy load with more depth than Punch Club. 3/10 steam please refund","January 17","false","7.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I also made the mistake of assuming this would have been a completed game, so the new content that came out for it was pretty much unplayable because you lose the ability to access it at the halfway point of the main story.\n\nAs for the game mechanics: the daily stat decay is so extreme you have to formulate a very strict training routine and ABSOLUTELY NOT DIVERT from it in order to keep your stats from going through the floor while making very minimal gains. While progressing through the game, you can minimize the reduction of your main stat, but all three are very important. That said, a look at the forums for this game seem to show that the developer is currently in a state of chasing their own tail trying to balance it out, and it's really a mess to behold. I did a little research and it looks like the stat decay works the way it does because if stats get too high, it's fully possible to have a character that's completely  unplayable due to the way stamina/energy is spent during attacks.\n\nIn the end, I guess I'm really just disappointed. After pretty much boycotting indie titles for a long time on Steam, I got my hand bit again and I'll remember to be more mindful in the future when choosing games to buy.","March 15","false","7.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

(Unless you like fighting yourself, because you have no control over your characters attack patterns or combos. As far as I know at least.) In this game you play as a kid whos dad was shot by an unknown man, and without spoiling the plot to much, involves a mysterious medallion which your father told you to hold on to for whatever reason.\n\nFighting (Probably the most important part of the game):\nYou can select the kidns of attacks you want to use and methods of protecting yourself, one turn you select dodge, and karate kick. The other maybe soemthing else. However, you do NOT control your character beyond this during a fight. It is completely up to lady luck, and the fighting is somewhat linear in that regard. After you select your actions your character will duke it out with your opponent. There's a stamina system as well. Your actions cost certain amount of stamina, once you run out, if your enemy manages to hit you, you will be knocked to the ground doing extra damage. The higher yor characters strength the more stamina you spend for each attack. You gain some samina back after laying on the ground. There are no forms of KOs in this game, the only way to win is to beat the enemy outright, or have the most health when the match runs out of time. After each round you regain stamina, (Rounds are counted down through seconds during a fight) you will also get to select a new attack. Meanign you can vary up your strategys, but often you do not want to do this.\n\nDifferent physichal skills.\nThere are three attributes, strength, agility, and stamina. in that order. There are also four branches. basic skills, (Very balanced, leaning no way when it comes to skills.) way of the bear (Strength) way of the tiger (Agility) and way of the turtle (Stamina). These are all based on the attributes mentioned beforehand. Now you might be wondering, how do I obtain attributes? Well you have to work out. The main thing you'll be doing at the start is training at the gym. You gain skills by selecting a peice of equipment and training on it, this consumes a variety of status points as I call them from your character. I'll explain that later. You can not work out forever as well, you do run out of time and the day ends, once the day ends you lose your stats. So, it is very important you continue to work out. You can also do steroids, you cheating fiend.\n\nManaging your charachters life:\nWelp, now its turned into sims. Just kidding your still playing punch club. Despite the way that first sentence might of sounded, I actually enjoy this. You have to go to a crocery store, and buy food, which is tored in your fridge automatically. This is where status poitns come into play. You have health which is lost during fights, food, which is lost through of variety of actions including sleeping and working out. Happieness, which can be gained through fights and watching TV. All of these are nescascary. You cannot work out without food or energy, and when you are sad, your workout efficiency is severely decreased. Health effects the amount of hit points you start each fight with. Low health equals lower HP. This all sounds very simple but it can get somewhat complicated, as you ahve to balance the needs of you character. There is also a tiem limit to each day, well, I owuldn't really call it a time limit per say, its more like paying taxes. You have to give up attributes at the end of each day, you lose time on the clock with every action you take, even going from place ot place. Lastly, money, which is important as well. You spend money on going to the gym, on food, steroids, and many other things. It is probably one of the most important parts of the game. So, in conclusion, I like this game a lot, it's also cheap! So buy it. Naow. Buy it naow. NAOWWWWWWWWWW!","January 20","true","2.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Actually any agi fighter really, during one sequence where you have to fight 4 different fighters I dominated the first, then had to overtrain a crazy amount to barely defeat the second (agi based). The next two fighters, one of whom was supposed to be a big deal I utterly demolished without any more training.\n\nI still recommend this game but there are some serious issues and I'm unsure if they will be rectified.\n\n**Original (6h in)**\n\nI was going to wait for a steam sale to pick this up but I watched the twitch feed for a bit and decided I'd rather have it now. I'm glad I did.\n\nOnto the game itself, there are the occassional frustrations of the RNGod which have my fighter losing to someone who I was able to beat multiple times before and have improved my fighter since then. I'm not a fan of how quickly stats are lost, I understand they did that so you can't just train up and wreck but it makes it hard to gain stats and very hard to gain stats in multiple categories which admittedly the game advises against. Then of course the early seemingly 100% chance of getting robbed when you have a significant amount of cash on you making early upgrades to the garage essentially not possible.\n\nDespite my minor frustrations with the gameplay this is a fantastic game and I'd recommend it to people who like rpg/sim/management types.","January 8","true","18.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whitetailfox/recommended/394310/","Whitetailfox","Whitetailfox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whitetailfox/","120 products in account","This game is what happens when an RPG meets a boxing manager.\n\nYou play a character following a storyline, leveling stats and skills, doing sidequests looking for a conclusion to your quest for revenge/justice/redemption/love/whatever. Pretty standard fair so far but with a different coat, or so you might think.\n\nHowever here's where the managing kicks in: you can't just fight tournaments and do sidequests, oh no. You have to eat, sleep, keep your mood up and make money to fund your journey. In a way you encounter all the problems you would realistically expect if you just decided to go from nobody to boxer, you have to waste away much of your day and effort in the gym to get buff, have to get some actual experience fighting and all this can't be done on an empty stomach either, so you have to eat. As an amateur boxer any money you win will not even cover the food expenses, so you're going to need to do a job, which in turn saps your energy that you will need to also train... you get the idea. Managing all these activities is part of the challenge and fun of the game.\n\nUnfortunately I often found that I ended up settling into a routine of grinding cash, spending half a day recovering and then grinding the gym just before the scheduled fight as low energy doesn't affect fight outcome. I could literally go totally exhausted from the gym right into the boxing match and be on even standing with my opponent. Basically the gameplay promotes finding a routine that works and grinding it over and over with events, sidequests and optional fights serving as a welcome distraction from it.\n\nAnd grind you will, physical stats rise fairly fast: you can go from wimpy nobody to hulk levels of strenght in what ammounts to less than a year ingame just by following a set routine. At the price that you also have to overcome gradually increasing stat decay. Yes, physical stats decay and you're likely going to have to settle either to concentrate on one or two, or investing into skills that lock them at a set level. Still the decay seems to serve mostly to prolong the grind and even more to motivate the player to follow a routine, cause heaven forbid you miss out a week of going to the gym and loose several stat points.\n\nThe stats themselves are interesting, they come with an advantage as well as a drawback, which is something I haven't seen before in an rpg game. Say you go for a high strenght build like I did: you'll quickly find out that if your super powerful attacks miss, all of a sudden your character is depleted of energy and turned into a punching bag for the nimble opponent who'll happily exploit your lack of ability to dodge or recover fast enough.\n\nLong story short: more strenght means higher energy consumption, which means having to also raise stamina, which means now one has to overcome stat decay of not one but two stats. But then the higher your strenght and stamina the lower your hit and dodge chances, so you need to also level your agility or else rely on luck that you'll hit your opponent before they critically cripple you.\n\nBasically stats come with ups and downs and their proportion seems more important than the actual number, or so was my experience. Starting a second game of 1STR/5AGI/1STA I won a training fight easily, however with a 5/5/5 ration the same fight was repeatedly narrowly lost! I'll leave to your consideration whether that's a clever or rubbish system, but I was intrigued by it if nothing else.\n\nSome perks were similiar too, the higher level ones in particular also came with negative effects and seemed to have been tailored for specialized strategies, like a perk that diassalowed my character to block, or even defend at all in exchange for higher damage. Sucks if you invested in those abilities earlier on and now they become useless. And sucks more if not taking that disabling perk prevents you from getting a good one behind it. Still the skill trees are big and varied offering a huge variety of choice, haven't had nearly enough time to experiment with all the possibilities.\n\nThe combat itself feels more like something out of a managing sim than an rpg. You don't actually control your character only pick a selection of skills your character prepares between rounds and then watch them fight till the next round or a knockout. Your input is picking the right strategy and hoping your character can execute it. Random chance can screw you over and it probably will every once in a while. Not for those who can't stand loosing a dice roll.\n\nAs for the game style and looks, it has a faux retro feel. The game mimics old SNES style, complete with retro sound effects, music and graphics a storyline that seems to take itself half serious, throwing in a reference/shoutout to rocky, fight club, street fighter, wrestling... However the story itself got incredibly stale towards the end, with nothing to do and nothing interesting happening between grinding and bossfights. I really wish the last part of the game received more attention as the felt very bland compared to the more fun first half.\n\nIn the end its a fun game, there's reasons to like and dislike it. It is unique enough to be memorable, has its own charm and is somewhat of a mix between a managerial/sim genre and an rpg. This alone sets it apart and made it worth the play for me. However the disadvantage is the grind you will have to go through to get the neccesary stats and skills to win, as well as some reliance on random chance at times (more for some stat builds than others). If you hate those things stay away, otherwise I'd recommend the game for those who like the style.","February 22","true","17.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It has great basic mechanics and is really well put-together. I thought I would really hate that you don't get to actively control the character during fights, but it's actually still pretty fun. You get to chose which moves they use during each round, and there's strong strategic elements to it.\n\nThe game's main flaw is that it is really, really difficult. Frustratingly so. I get that they wanted to provide a challenge, but it ends up being more frustrating than fun most of the time, for me. Each day you lose stats, and it really just feels like you're being robbed. You have to manage your time carefully to make any progress at all, and if you fail, then your character slowly spirals into decay. Also, the matches can't be skipped, sped up, or forfeited by any means that I'm aware of, which sucks when you are slowly losing over the course of five rounds.\n\ntl;dr: Great game, but too frustrating.

After you come to terms with the fact that Punch Club isn’t a free roaming Fight Club game where you can just do whatever you want and build to your heart’s content and more of a boxing management sim which tells a story, everything gets better. I love all of the Stallone references and the general 80’s shout outs from posters to the van in your garage. If you don’t try to get too deep into the talent trees, you’ll probably beat this game with a good/solid love for Punch Club. If you try to grind it out, you’ll probably get burned out. That’s never a good thing. Enjoy the story and then play it again and go to jail or make a straight Agility build with no strength because you know that’s what you want to do even if it’s nerfed. We all want to be ninja’s because ninja’s are cool.","May 8","true","13.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

And that's a good thing. Great balance with the different mechanics available leads to an actual challenge, as the wrong moves will set you back significantly and you won't make promise. While at times this will lead to frustration, there's a bunch of different strategies that you will have to implement based on the current situation, and there was an actual smart decision made by the developers here to be not directly involved in the fight. It puts the emphasis on the training elements of the game, but still allows you strategy by selecting the appropriate skills that you will need to counteract your opponents strengths, or maybe complement your own. Most of the problems that the game in the simulator genre are more on the minor side, with the aesthetic (while alright) isn't exactly the greatest, I'd rather have keyboard controls implemented with some of the menus, just to make things easier.  But in the end, it's a great simulator game that I enjoyed my time with, with multiple reasons to come back to it.\n\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/nBAxHTwm37g\n\nLists:\n+:\nA Difficult but still fair simulator that actually punishes you for not taking advantage of the situations, and makes it so that you may not make progress at times. Forces the player to actually sit down and look at every option available to them.\nStrong strategy elements in the combat element because of the lack of direct control by the player. Forces smart decision making and taking advantage of what's in front of you. Like the imiplementation of stamina and what it means if you don't have any left.\nSkill Tree has significant choices that actually mean something, more then just the 3 major stats. Each skill have sub elements to it means you can specialize even further, like being an aggressive boxer that goes for stamina.\nGood Design on the temporary boosts so that you had to earn them, but when you did, they actually meant something.\nGood balance between the different aspects of work/training/etc. Couldn't rush one, had to do them all.\nLiked the TMNT reference. Even if it was corny.\n-:\nAt times, do wish there was at least a hint of what you were getting into, as in some cases, you'd get your ♥♥♥ kicked because you did something way before you should of.\nSmall annoyance with not knowing exactly what I need to complete missions or how close I am at times, wondering if I'm putting effort in that is ultimately pointless.\nThere's a small pause at times after selecting something, and sometimes the hourglass sticks around even though I can click on something.\nKeyboard shortcuts. Would have loved them. Options in general seem to be lacking.\nBattle animations will get repetitive. Would have loved a way to speed up the action during them.\nSTOP ROBBING ME RIGHT BEFORE A BIG PURCHASE. This really just annoyed me. How does he know how much money I have on hand at all times?","January 8","true","6.7"," 20 of 43 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","20","43","3","0"

If you enjoy 80's and 90's themed fighting movies, then this will be right up your alley.\n\nThe art style, sound and music are a great throw back to the day of old, but don't let the look fool you.   It has a surprising amount of depth, and is actually pretty tough.\n\nIt remains challenging to manage all your stats and finances whilst at the same time keeping up your training and preparing for the next big fight. It's got that one more fight type of hook.\n\nEven though you don't directly control the fights themselves, there are fair mount lot of tactical choices and build customization to choose from for you fighter. Choose your abilities based on your characters strengths, and who your opponent is and what skills they are using.\n\nThere is a story as well, with branching choices that can be made, as well as different endings. That and the ability to play your fighter using a differ build will definitely add some replayablity.\n\nThe only thing I would have to criticize in my time with the game so far is the lack of music variety.\nThere is only really 1 track that plays while you are going about your daily tasks, and it eventually starts to get repetitive. After turning down the music volume to 20% it was better. Having other tracks or even less busy background music in those sections would've been nice.\n\nI've made a video just taking a look at the game here\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3o_Q7Hr4ILc\n\nGreat surprise and came out of nowhere!\n\nThe developers were nice enough to provide me with a code for the game. Did that effect my opinion of the game? No. I still think its great and worth picking up.\n\nIf you like the this style of game I'd highly recommend it, one of  the better fighter management games out there.\n\nEDIT: I finished the game yesterday at around day 253 using an agility based build.\n\nToward the end it got kind of repetitive, but it turns out that was due to a bug, which caused goals to take longer to reach than they should've, which I believe has since been fixed.\n\nAll in all I still recommend the game. The dev's have been pretty active in balancing and fixing stuff so far and I'm looking forward to trying out another build with my 2nd playthrough :)","January 10","true","19.1"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","0"

I can't do any more Gym fights, no more bum fights, no more illegal ultimate fights and no more quests from the Don. I'm now stuck in the first city, with nothing to do but eat, sleep and train, and several hours of grinding wasted, because i can't progress. I even beat all the side-quests available, but nothing seems to help. Spoken to every npc there is, to no avail. I would avoid this game, unless you'd like to risk end up having your hours upon hours of grinding to be useless and wasted.\n\nDo not buy this game until this has been fixed...\n\nEDIT: The devs told me to send them my savefile, which I did. A few hours later, I get an email with a savefile they say will fix the bug, and it did. So they fixed this error for me, and I'm sure given time, they will fix the others as well.","January 12","false","7.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","1"

The story is interesting and somewhat engaging. However after the initial burst of fun the game quickly becomes a train, fight, eat and repeat grind that gets tedious. The entire game took me less than ten hours to finish and offers little replay value. Perhaps some people may want to replay a different fighting style or a different story path. Overall I would recommend waiting for a sale unless you really enjoy this genera of game.","January 9","true","12.7"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Here's my expierence.\n\nI got saddled with a dodge and a kick which drain your stamina and are virtually useless. You are not provided in any way shape or form the very basics of fighting. You have to buy the ability to block and punch. I'M NOT JOKING! The ability to block and punch was barred from me, saddling me with two useless abilties that drained my stamina so much that me winning a fight was pure ♥♥♥♥ing luck. The fights are a broken mess where I got trounced by a fighter despite thje fact that my stats were 3 times higher than his, because of the kick and dodge. The leveling system makes it nothing more than a tedious grind to get the most basic of techniques due to the fact that everything becomes grossly expensive at an alarming rate. Not to mention that you only have 2 ability slots and you are forced to fight characters with 4. This game is an unbalanced, frustrating, tedious grind, so in conclusion the developers of this game can shove it firmly up there ♥♥♥.","January 18","false","1.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I get in a fight with my friend Roy no less who had stats 4,3,4. I lost the fight, not just lost but had my ♥♥♥ handed to me. That's not okay; when your fighter COMPLETELY outclasses another you kinda should win. But instead I had my fighter stop attacking the Roy so that he could get his energy back up.....cuz I guess my guy thought it wouldn't be very nice to fight someone when they are out of enerygy?? I had about 40 points worth of Energy but my guy literally just stood there and let Roy get his strength back up to 20 and then just let the guy tear his 102 HP down to zero.\n\nI can deal with losing fair and square and I can deal with having some close wins and losses with guys who are closer in stats with me, I can't tolerate that loss though. It was because these garbage developers don't know how to design RNG and I'm done with this crap.
