The difficulty past the first five or six levels skyrockets, and the game keeps piling up new mechanics on you until almost the very end. It requires excellent spatial awareness, but the feeling of satisfaction after cracking a particularly fiendish puzzle is unparalleled. The levels are ordered in semi-nonlinear fashion, but there are several "chokepoints" that may block you from further progress for hours as you despair for a solution.\n\nThe presentation is very simplistic (as you van see from the screenshots), but clear and legible. The sound and music are, fittingly, ascetic, with ambient humming and chanting.\n\nYou will get stuck. More than once. And you'll love it.","November 25, 2013","true","1.0"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","32","34","0","1"

Expect to be challenged, and do NOT expect to sit down and crank through a bunch of these in a single sitting. For folks who are not looking for difficult, abstract, mind-bendy 3D puzzles? Definitely not the place to look.\n\nThat being said, I had a good time with it for the most part. Some of them were just plain old DAMN hard, but when I felt like I had some degree of comprehension of what was needed, it was a good type of challenging.","February 15, 2014","true","4.7"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","0"

It's just insanse. It does share the tools that made smb great though, you can instantly restart a level with the press of the button, when you fail, and failing will come often here, you also get the turn back by one move feature, which is great for experimenting when your not sure , powering through with trial and error, or salvaging a run on one of the later puzzles. Together these make the game bearable.\n\nYou play as a square which flips from space to space, but it throws new things at you constantly. One of the most notable, is that gravity is determined in the direction that you move, and only for things you come into contact with, which is one of the hardest conceptual challenges I've faced in a long time. You'll have to deal with the cube based nature of the game on another level when you are asked to "cut' specific shapes into your square, using a raised platform to flip right, on top of it, and back down to present a different face to be cut.\n\nGameplay is pretty varied, and the game is semi non linear, as the unlocking process branches out early in the game, giving you some things to come back to if you are stomped to hard. For example, you can choose to work on whale after beating larva, or go straight to advanced larva, and later you can choose  (freely, you get them all at once)between planting, half sided, and Larva+Whale, and planting itself leads to a further choice of advanced planting and garden.\n\nEvery new level brings something new to the table, and every one of the advanced levels turned out to not just be a "more of the same but super long now" but to creatively ask you to do something different. Also intereactions between the gravity ball from larva and the whale thing... turn out to be absoultely insanse.\n\nThis game is pretty much  the benchmark for undiscovered gems for anyone who loves playing puzzles. It is almost entirely clever, and has an unusually amount of content for this genre of game. The time saving features make it seem fair. It does have a few sour spots... a handful of levels literally cannot be done in less than 7+ minutes, ramping  up already crazy difficulty on an artificial level. They are very rare and unlikely to be encountered by anyone less than 15 hours in, or 9 if you have a ♥♥♥♥ ton of experience.\n\nThis game will be in your libraray for an insanely long time if you have the will to beat it. The graphics... grow on you after a while. While you are in some kind of geometrical nighmare puzzle world, the background is like a petri dish under a microscope with cell things just floating around or idling in place, and the level selection just looks amazing, although it is a bit unwieldy.\n\nIf you think you have become the god of all things puzzle;that you will never be beyond a weekend stand to learn the mechanics of some new gimmick game and master it : then English Country Tune will be your final trial before you can ascend to a higher plane. And it might just put you in your place.","November 7, 2014","true","11.9"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","1"

First of all, the soundtrack isn't English or Country... though it is a tune (albeit not an amazing one). And while this review may have started negatively, my opinion of English Country Tune is anything but. Simply because it is a very good puzzle game and that it's everything it's aspiring to be. The puzzles are based on those movement or arranging puzzles where you have to move certain objects to certain locations (some further research lead me to a style of puzzle called Sokoban).\n\nOverall, the game has the feel of an end of degree, final project except for one difference. The gameplay and level design is actually well-refined with a lot of thought and time going into each level. The harder puzzles have only one solution with only an undo button and reset button to help you through (or help you backtrack). The graphics are rudimentary and there is no initial instruction in the menu screen. It took me a while to work out how to access the puzzles. And while the graphics are basic, they are perfect for this game.\n\nFor full review, visit:\nhttp://icarusreviews.net/2014/10/15/brief-write-of-a-brief-flight-english-country-tune/","October 15, 2014","true","0.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

One world consists of levels that require you to actually build the level until it is covered in immobile, impassible cubes that result from your every other step, and that's where I gave up.

That should be enough said but heres some information on the game.\n\nEnglish Country Tune is a sokoban puzzler similair to those you would see from PuzzleScript, but this one is in 3d. This game uses a large variety of creative elements. The puzzles are well designed and while there are some instructions you will more often learn what things do through experimentation.\n\nGame is long enough to be worth it. Levels are unlocked by completing specific other levels, but often creates small branches to other levels. Watch which ones so you can unlock them first and have more choices if you get stuck. No achievements. I like acheivements I dont know why he doesnt want them but thats ok.\n\nGame never really got hard. The last levels combine all the elements and show some more interesting ways they can interact, but they werent really any more challenging. They were some of the most fun levels though. Lots of variety.\n\nUltimately, English Country Tune is a good quality experimental puzzler. Check out PuzzleScript if you havent.

There aren't very many types of blocks to get used to, but the rules governing each of them are surprisingly deep, and even at the beginning of the game, you really have to understand all of the subtle rules thoroughly in order to plan ahead and complete each level. For example, the "larva" blocks are pushed around when you run into them. But gravity applies to them selectively, and you absolutely must understand how gravity works in order to get them to fall into the right positions.\n\nBecause of the complex rules, you need to plan ahead - guessing rarely gets you to the correct solution.

If you can enjoy playing a modest variety of Sokoban remakes for any prolonged period of time, then you certainly should buy this.\n\nThe negative stuff: What I wrote above is exactly what the game is - a collection of interesting Sokoban variants. Every level set has slightly different rules, but it's still just a bunch of increasingly difficult puzzles, with no extra value. Even the graphical impression is quite plain and uninteresting.\n\nNot a worst buy I ever made, but there are tons of better puzzle games to spend those few bucks on, hence 'nay' from me.","January 23, 2014","false","0.2"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

The mechanics are confusing, but I've had no need to understand them, since I was able to get through a fair chunk of the game just going along the one route the puzzle lets me take and making minor adjustments when I fail. No thought required. It's not a bad game per se, but there are much better puzzle games out there. If the aesthetic interests you, I'd recommend checking out TRI: Of Friendship and Madness instead.

When I finally found a level I couldn't beat, there was no indication as to what I was supposed to do to beat it. A solid nope from me on this one. It's a puzzle game that does not feel at all rewarding.","December 22, 2013","false","0.1"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","6","18","0","0"

I picked this up as part of a Humble Bundle and decided to give it a go. A serious mind bending puzzle game. It gently reveals the mechanics and goals, and leaves it to you. Great for exercising the grey cells and not the adrenal gland. Expect to be frustrated if 3-dimensional puzzle solving isn't your thing, but one certainly feels a sense of accomplishment when one discovers the elegant solutions to a the geometric puzzles. Personally I found the colour scheme rather jarring after a while, which was on the whole good since I was able to stop playing to rest my eyes.

The gameplay - which incidentally has nothing to do with the English, or country tunes - consists mostly of various more-or-less creative block pushing puzzles. The first - "Larva" - has blocks that fall in different directions depending on which direction they are pushed in, which is a pretty neat idea. The quality of the puzzles varies (never truly reaching very high or very low quality), and I never really got stuck.

Copied below is my review on metacritic:\n\nSuperb game, and near-perfect in it's execution and atmosphere, English Country Tune is a deep meditation on 3-dimensional space.\n\nThe game presents a series of puzzles in a rich and mysterious world that even in the beginning can be quite challenging. Through the rapid introduction of interacting variables in the puzzle space, the challenge reaches such a degree of difficulty that only sustained meditation and visualisation of possibilities will generate a solution.\n\nThis could have been a lot of un-fun work, but somehow the combination of atmospheric and uninterrupted music, colours and a space that is utterly joyous to navigate make this game one of the most incredible experiences of any I've played. I distinctly remember feeling moments where my neurons connected in ways I did not think possible, and the satisfaction of finding a solution was often overwhelmingly pleasurable.\n\nHighly recommended, very original, and best played without a walkthough, and resetting puzzles instead of using the undo function.\n","April 16, 2014","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If one feels completely overwhelmed by a particular puzzle, oftentimes the best way to go is to leave the game, get some rest, let your brain do the work, and come back to it fresh the next morning, and more often than not it will solve itself.\n\nFortunately, thanks to its very well made undo feature (that also works to undo a restart by the way !), it encourages experimentation and as a result never feels frustrating. Even better, the beautiful ambient score (on more than one occasion reminiscent of artists like Steve Roach, for example) ensures that the experience is often more soothing than stressful : unlike a lot of puzzle games, there is no stress element in English Country Tune, no timer, no lives, no limited continues. It's just you and a bunch of extremely well-designed, unique puzzles.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone who enjoys a good brain teaser.","May 23, 2015","true","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't currently love this game because there is a lot of spacial and 3D challenges going on, and I've always had a problem solving 3D puzzles. This does not make it a bad game, it's just difficult for those of us with problems like that--but good for stretching your brain???","December 1, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zweikreise/recommended/207570/","zweikreise","Zwei Kreise","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zweikreise/","97 products in account","I am still not done with this game but I think I can safely say that this is one of the best collections of puzzles you can experience in a game, probably period.\n\nUnconcerned with trivial concepts like conventional gravity and the laws of physics, this game, even in its crazier moments, never ends up feeling obtuse or alienating, but rather challenging and enticing. If one feels completely overwhelmed by a particular puzzle, oftentimes the best way to go is to leave the game, get some rest, let your brain do the work, and come back to it fresh the next morning, and more often than not it will solve itself.\n\nFortunately, thanks to its very well made undo feature (that also works to undo a restart by the way !), it encourages experimentation and as a result never feels frustrating. Even better, the beautiful ambient score (on more than one occasion reminiscent of artists like Steve Roach, for example) ensures that the experience is often more soothing than stressful : unlike a lot of puzzle games, there is no stress element in English Country Tune, no timer, no lives, no limited continues. It's just you and a bunch of extremely well-designed, unique puzzles.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone who enjoys a good brain teaser.","May 23, 2015","true","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is actually a pretty interesting puzzler. They graphics are minamalistic, the music is soothing, and the mechanincs are intriguing.

The gameplay constantly surprises me with new ideas and goes against my expectations, against my intuition and everything I know about our universe. It does that in a very beautiful, mind expanding way.
