If you wanted more Xortex after playing it in the lab, this is it, it's Xortex and much more! A few suggestions for the developer:  Make upgrades only show up in the play area, sometimes they spawn where I can't get to them, also please include a pause button (so the player can re-oreient/de-tangle after multiple waves and an option for changing the leaderboards for each mode.  Other than a bug or 2, I'm absolutely loving the game and looking forward to future updates!","May 29","true","2.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Gameplay-wise it's exactly what I wanted out of a game like this. Simple shooting, spaceships, lots of dodging and weaving, fun music, and leaderboards.\n\nOne request: As an option it would be nice to switch the spaceship to be level with the top of the ring on the controller so we can hold it with a more gun-style grip.\n\nThanks for the great game!!","May 27","true","0.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Only made it to wave 6 at normal difficulty and I\'m sweating like a pig LOL\n\nGood music, good graphics, nice interface and menus, awesome gameplay!\n\nI hate bullet hell games BTW, and I thought that would be a lot like it but nope! This is GREAT!\n\nOnly thing I don\'t quite like is that stuff too often spawn in your back? Maybe tweak it a little so it does happen but not as frequently?\n\nOh, and more 8 bit music please :-)","May 31","true","0.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I love the later enemies and bosses into waves 25-30. The game doesn't look as good as valve, but honestly disregard those reviews. No indie dev should be held up to valves standards.

I love the music but if I don't want to listen to it I can stop it and play my own which is cool since I like to listen to my own when playing games sometimes. VR always amazes me.

It resembles the game from the lab, and lab has better graphics "just a slight better", but the wow factor is there too.  I also love how it saves the waves for you.  Great game to show your friends!","May 27","true","0.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You'll love this.\n\nIt's still got a few rough spots due to the Early Access nature, but it's completely worth the money. A bigger room with more variety of enemies, power ups like homing rockets and a second drone already have me hooked.\n\nAbout the only bad thing so far is you need a spotter to tell you to start spinning the other way since you'll get tangled up moving so much.\n\nExcellent work and I can't wait to see what else they've got planned.","May 27","true","1.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

If you enjoyed the Labs arcade game called Xortex but wanted it to be more in depth then this is your game. The creator is active on reddit and is asking for constructive criticism, always a good sign. The game has a solid foundation with permanant bonuses and upgrades, feels a bit like a 3D Gradius so far as far as the weapon upgrades go. I think this game has legs and I think its worth the money or at the very least will be shortly.","May 28","true","0.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There are three game modes to choose from.  One is a classic mode where the enemy drones fly to you. The second mode is a core defense, where you protect the core from enemy drones.  The third is an endless mode where you see how long you can stay alive.\n\nIt has some nice permanent power ups that you can choose from after killing bosses, and some temporary power ups that you can get from killing enemies.  One of the things I really appreciate is the save points after every 5 waves.  It keeps things challenging but not tedious.  Leaderboards are also available.\n\nThis game requires quite a bit of situational awareness.  The challenge isn't in the speed of the mobs and bullets, but the location of everything.  If you stop paying attention you'll find yourself in some serious trouble very quickly.\n","May 27","true","7.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

No, this does not affect my opinion of it.\n\nChamber 19 is an immersive and intense reimagining of the Lab's Xortex. If you liked Xortex, but felt that it lacked content, this game was made for you. Granted it doesn't have the graphics of a triple A title, however it is still leaps and bounds ahead of most indie vr games and is still only in Early Access. Definitely worth the $15.","June 6","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
