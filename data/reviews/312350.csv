This is a grand operational level game where you control one of the two alliances in WW1, with a choice of 5 start dates.  It's a bit like Panzer General etc. in that it's turn based - you move and attack with all your units one at a time, then your opponent takes his turn and does the same.  It's not like PG in that it is one continuous campaign - no linked scenarios with core units gaining xp,  Also, you have to control both land and naval units, as well as manage research and unit production.  There is multiplayer, but I haven't tried it so far, and there is only AI for your opponent (you're thrown in the deep end - you have to manage everything for your side yourself).\n\nI suggest you check out some of the let's plays by RiotHouseLP if you want to see what the gameplay is like.  One thing about those LP's though - they're a year old, and it looks like the game has had one or more updates since then.\n\nThe AI is reasonably competent - on land it knows how to break through weak spots in your line and encircle and cut off units.  My advice on either side of the 1914 start is focus on cranking out cheap garrison units until you have enough to maintain continuous fronts with some reserves.  The AI wasn't so good with the German Navy though - when I loaded up my first BEF units to cross the channel, it sent a battleship and cruiser into the channel to attack a transport.  This might have been ok if he was certain to sink it, but he didn't, and anyway I don't think it's worth sacrificing a battleship just to kill one land unit.  So the AI doesn't know the value to the Germans of just keeping a fleet in being.  It seemed to handle the Allied fleets better.\n\nOK, back to my 5th start - maybe this time I can make it through the end of 1914 at least ;)\n\nUpdate:\nAfter another couple tries starting as CP in 1914, I've given up for now trying to win with them until I get better at the game.  One of the things I like most about historical wargames is when by playing them you can learn a real historical lesson.  In this case, the lesson is that the Central Powers have almost no chance of winning if they can't knock out at least one of their 3 opponents in the first year.  After that, the numbers are all on the side of the Entente for winning any war of attrition.\n\nI've now played a complete game as the Entente.  I won through to a complete victory in 1917.  I defeated Germany and Austria-Hungary early in 1916, but the pesky Ottomans wouldn't surrender until I moved some armies all the way across the map to Egypt and the Caucasus to start putting a hurt on them.  It was worthwhile though because learned how to perform an amphibious invasion and I got to see the importance of massed airpower, artillery, and shore bombardment in punching through otherwise hopelessly strong static trench defenses.\n\nSo, a definite thumbs up!","July 26, 2014","true","79.7"," 106 of 113 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","106","113","0","0"

After reading other negative reviews this game has recieved i was struck by how ridiculous they were. Well over half of them state that the ai cheats. That the ai has huge production bonuses and can produce three times as many units as human players. That the ai's units recieve combat bonuses that make them twice as strong as the human players units. All these claims are simply not true. However i can understand how many players have come to these false conclusions.\n\n- The ai are very good for a turn based strategy game and may provide a serious challenge to newcomers.\n\n- The strategy's you must use to triumph are so vastly different to all other strategy games, simply because the first world war was and still is so vastly different to any other wars that have ever been fought.\n\n- The attacking unit will always take far more damage than the defending unit (up to four times in fact!!!) therefore to overwhelm a single enemy infantry unit is not uncommon to have to attack it with 3 of your own infantry units and only after you have weakened said enemy infantry unit with artillery bombardments and harried them with fighters.\n\n\nMany players have also claimed that artillery, fighters, armoured cars, bombers, zeppelins and cavalry are useless and unbalanced. While there may have been some serious balance issues in 1.5 the recent release of the 1.6 beta patch has fixed 90 percent of these balance issues. As for these units being useless even prior to the patch this was never the case. Artillery may appear to do little damage but the small amounts of damage they do in addition to the damages in efficency they cause to enemy units are invaluable and are almost required to make any kind of serious pushes into enemy territory. Fighters and bombers function as aerial artillery and there large range and high sight values make them very usefull as scouting units. Zeppelins have the highest range and sight and this more then makes up for there lack of durability and the drain they will inflict on your precious ammo stockpiles. Armoured cars are twice as fast as infantry units can see four time as far. This makes them usefull scouting units. What cavalry lack in defense they make up for in speed, sight and offensive capabilitys.\n\nCommander the great wars singleplayer will eventually get dull. However the multiplayer never will i hope you have enjoyed my rambling review and that you will like it to prevent any firther loss in sales this game may suffer due to false accusations of cheating ai.\n\nGood day","January 31, 2015","true","481.2"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","41","44","0","1"

The dev team also put together a genuinely challenging AI, too: even on "Balanced" mode, you'll find yourself fighting for every battlefield advantage you can muster.\n\nSpeaking as an old-school tabletop-wargaming grognard, The Great War is definitely worth the $20 it's currently on sale for.\n\nUnfortunately it suffers from three problems:\n\n1) While much of the game is highly intuitive to grasp, there's zero in-game help for the more obtuse bits.  Until you give the out-of-game manual a read-through, you'll inevitably make small but crucial mistakes that end up hampering your strategy.  I highly recommend playing one game for familiarization and then skim the manual for the bits that seem confusing.\n\n2) All moves and decisions are both immediate and irreversible.  Did you misclick, sending a unit out of the front line and opening a gap for your enemy to exploit?  Your only recourse is to load a save, and hope you did it recently.  "Save Often, Save Well".\n\n3) Although you can play in a window, I don't recommend it.  Doing anything outside the game seems to slow it down dramatically, the more so as the game progresses.  It was only the second year of the war by the time single-unit moves were taking the computer several minutes to analyze and execute.\n\nBut if you're interested in this particular conflict and are willing to devote yourself exclusively to it for the duration of gameplay, "The Great War" offers an enjoyable challenge.","July 27, 2014","true","109.5"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","40","44","0","0"

I have played this game for a while and got the hang of it.\nIt is a great game of WW1 with a couple of frustrating imperfections that you only really appreciate when you have played quite a bit. So while i might say negative things at the end of this review this is a recommendation.\n\nFor starters it feels like WW1.\nThe graphics look the part.  The map covers everything and there is plenty of open ocean for the naval campaigns to unfold.  The opening turns also develop in a  very similiar manner  to the actual war as long as you play even modestly sensibly as either side.\ninfantry battles are a hard slog.  A mistake in position can be very unforgiving.\nBritain relies on convoys. The germans need to get their subs out or they will lose quickly.\nThe Austrians have no convoy resources to build gear or extra artillery shells but can maintain a respectable infantry force.\nBattleship battles can be very important for morale.\nAll very WW1.\n\nIt has a great integration between the naval and land war, in that what happens in each is vital to your war effort, whatever side you are on.  It has a representation of all major theatres so you can decide to make your push where you want to. Want to quickly crush the Serbs? The Central Powers (germany,  Austria et al) must send all your artillery there first. But then it wont be in France or Russia for a couple of turns. Can you cope with that?\nAlthough many reviewers have said artillery and other auxiliary units such as aircraft can be both over powered and under powered it really depends on the circumstances. Just a small amount can tip the balance. Even a shore bombardment might make all the difference to destroying a unit or letting it stay in place.. Having said that aircraft should really only be important for Recon in the first couple of years but even for recon they are a must have. Why have have Airships? They are fantastic for recon and  anti sub warfare.  As the Entente (Britain, France et al) i always build them to kill the German subs. Why have armoured cars? In open battlefields they can help cut vital supply lines and also have a recon role. They are a must have for the Turks on the Caucasian front.\n\nContrary to what many may think the tech tree and decisions there are vital.  German infantry start off better than every one else and it up to you to make it stay that way if you want to win as central powers.   There is a real infantry arms race that is apparent if you get to 1916 and havent done any upgrades of your infantry.  Also the tech tree allows both sides to get different nations to specialise. All nations should both do infantry and artillery trees but, for example, the brits can do naval and the French can do aircraft so you can sell your labs  you dont need and buy extra labs in the areas you like.\n\nOk whats wrong with this game?\nMany reviewers have said the AI is over powered and cheats.\nI think the AI is actually hopeless in the naval war and easily gets confused when battle lines open out as they do in Russia.\n\nIt does really silly early war builds such as many artillery pieces that can never be used because of shell shortages.\nThe AI as the central powers never builds enough subs to begin with and never really challenges the convoys that the british and french recieve. As an entente player you can use your subs in the Baltic,  armoured cruisers in the atlantic and light cruisers in norway and the Germans will be lucky to get 1 convoy through in the whole game. On the contrary when you play as the  central powers you can develop strategies to keep your convoys going or if necessary to restart them if they are stopped by entente naval warfare.\n\njust on convoys the manual says you get an  10 manpower points per merchant ship that arrives. You actually get 100 and so if you get even ten convoys in that makes a 1000 which is more than most countries start with.  As the germans i start with around 1850 manpower points at the beginning of the war, by april 1916 in one game i had 2374 manpower points in germany. A great way to populate a country but not very realistic. As a note I have never actually played a game where man power made any difference to either side. Manpower quality is said to be in the game and occasionally you get a note saying its gone down but i have noticed the difference, however well or badly i was doing.\n\nAs Central powers you only build infantry,  subs and replacements for your 3 planes if they get destroyed..  Heaps of fluffy stuff can come later and will be useful (see later) but if you want to survive that is what you need.\n\nAs Entente the AI stuffs Egypt full of infantry, artillery and planes.  For gods sake it only needs 4 infantry 1 gun and a plane to hold there against what ever the turks can muster for years!  Also as the Entente it is pointless to try to conquer turkey from there. You do it by taking Constantinople from your position in  Serbia after crushing Bulgaria. The game system gives  the Entente 3 free infantry units in april 1915 offshore at gallipoli. never land at Gallipoli, send the Anzacs to Serbia where they will do a seriously good job.  The AI nearly always lands them at gallipoli where they get slaughtered.\n\nThe real fail in the AI of the  game though has been mentioned before by other reviewers and that is when italy joins the war most of the french and british units defending France all go to italy and capturing Paris becomes a walk in the park for the germans. Contrast this against the fact that in the many games i have played i have rarely won in france before italy joins the war so up to this point the game mechanics and balance has been extremely good in recreating a version of what actually played out in history. France was historically the battlefield where the horrible grind occurred and the war was won and lost in bitter battles on sea in the atlantic and in russia.\n\nLastly i will give you one of my secrets to winning as the germans if the game plays out past 1916.  Buy lots of artillery labs and build the railway guns. Dont bother with wasting money on buying much extra artillery shell production as the railway guns only use 2 artillery shells per shot rather than 10 for conventional guns. It also fires as well, if not better, than the normal guns, contrary to the manual. lastly its a railway gun so must stick to railways but Paris and every other main city or objective is on a railway.\n\nAlso to get your shell production up 5 shells a turn can easily cost 200 points . As the Central Powers do you want ten subs or ten infantry or 1 extra artillery shot every second turn.. thats a no brainer.\n\nJust a couple of things for the AI to get right and this a all time classic strategy game, even against the AI. Obviously with an arranged game with another player none of these AI issues are a problem.\n\nStill after all this 400 + hours tells me i love this game.  You will too.\n\n","September 16, 2015","true","108.4"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","33","34","3","0"

I like both of 'em, but still had some questions, even that Slitherine(For me it's like a seal of quality) is game publisher.\nOverall I'm really interested in any Great War staff(Books, Games, etc.), but there are only few good games in WW1 setting.\n\nFinally I decided - It's time to try this title and I got interesting mixture between Panzer Corps and AGEod wargames.\nGame offers few scenarios, each by starting year. You choose side by alliance - Entente or Central Powers, you can't choose and play only one country, but for WW1 wargames it's OK. But it wou,d be nice to see Entente devided by two more alliences(both on one side ofcource) - Western Entente and Russia with Serbia, cause these two theathers were historically "independent" even they fought on one side. But it's a feature which "would be nice to see".\n\nIn game you can produce units, research militsry staff(grenades, machineguns, gas, etc.), increace transport capacity by investing resources into railways, ship transport and etc.\nBesides ground warfare, game offers naval and simplified aerial warfares(including strategic airship bombardment).\nGraphics are eyecandy. In-game interface, town & officers photos, events along with sound effect and music deserve special attention - all of this provides you with nice experience.\nBy the way, game perfectly rins on touchscreen devices, which is really important for me(especially abibility to hover cursor above unit to calculate predicted losses, not all of wargames even if they work with touchscreens support this feature)\n\nOverall game is looking and playing very nice. Despite it's looking simple it's hard to master game. I'm really happy that I finally decided to get this one. If you still questioning yourself, but intersted in Great War or looking for a good wargame - Get Commander: The Great War! :)\n\nRUS:\nОчень долго присматривался к этой игре, т.к. не до конца понимал что получу в итоге.\nТо ли клон Panzer Corps, то ли что-то похоже на варгеймы AGEod, обе из перечисленных варгеймов мне очень нравятся, но терзали сомнения несмотря на то, что издатель Slitherine(что для меня является знаком качества).\nВообще тема Великой Войны меня всегда привлекала, но качественных игр, в любом жанре, по этой тематике можно пересчитать по пальцам.\n\nНаконец-то я решился и взял Commander: The Great War. В итоге я получил гибрид Panzer Corps и варгеймов от AGEod.\nВаргейм предлагает на выбор несколько сценариев разделенных по годам. На выбор 2 стороны - Антанта и Центральные Державы. Выбрать одну страну и играть только за нее невозможно - только союзы, что для Варгеймов по 1-й Мировой Войне помоему - плюс, единственное можно было-бы разделить Антанту на 2 части - "Западная Антанта" и Россия с Сербией, т.к. это 2 ТВД, которые на протяжении войны несмотря на нахождения стран в единном союзе были практически независимы друг от друга, но это скорее мое пожелание, чем недовольство.\n\nИгра дает возможность производить боевые единицы, проводить исследования военной направленности, увеличивать транспортные возможности -инвестируя в Ж/Д линии, транспортные корабли и т.д.\nПомимо наземных сражений игра предлагает морские и упрощенные воздушные операции(Включая стратегические бомбардировки с помощью дирежаблей).\n\nГрафика приятна глазу - аккуратно нарисованнные гекс, красивые эффекты и просто приятные модельки юнитов.\nИгровой интерфейс, фотографии городов, офицеров и фото эвентов вместе с замечательным звуком и музыкой заслуживают отдельного внимания - все это вместе погружаетв игру очень сильно.\nТак же игра отлично работает на тачскрин девайсах, что для меня сейчас очень важно(особенно функция при наведении курсора на юнита для прогнозирования результатов сражения, к сожалению не везде это есть)\n\nВ общем и целом игра очень приятная и несмотря на кажущуюся простоту довольно занятна. В общем я рад, что решился ее приобрести, если у вас еще есть сомнения, но вам интересна тема Великой Войны или вы ищете занятный варгейм - смело берите "Commander: The Great War"! :)","July 9, 2015","true","97.0"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","36","40","0","0"

Well it did not pan out as expected, but this also means that we will see some World War 1 games this year. Which is cool :)\nIf you are a history buff and you like this period you have probably noticed that there are not many games set into this period. World War 2 is by FAR popular, but at least this year this will change.\nHere we have a nice and pretty 2D turn based game, that could simply be described as Panzer General set in World War 1. In fact Siltherine has made their own engine pretty similar to already mentioned classic on which this game and Panzer Corps are based.\n\nGood sides of this game:\n- its pretty fast paced\n- its easy to learn\n- it has nice and clean graphic for a turn based wargame\n- it was made by the guys who know A LOT about history, are modding veterans from another well known game and their attention to details is simply amazing\n\nNot so good sides:\n- the scale of the game is a bit too small to realistically simulate trench warfare and fighting for every town. While it works great for games set in World War 2, this war was something completely different.\n- the game is quite simplified, but I would prefer a better diplomacy model and the ability to have some influence over it. Here the events are more or less hard coded. There is no way to not attack Belgium as Central Powers and to play some "what if" situations like "Russia First".\n- engine has its own limitations and it seems that is not possible to have air and land units on the same hex. This can be frustrating as the map is, as already mentioned, pretty small and it gets overcrowded pretty quick.\n\nMy final score would be  7/10 as it is still a nice game with its good and not so good sides. I would recommend it for people who want a quick take on World War 1, but would not recommend it to the ones who want a deep game with custom strategic and tactical decisions.","July 26, 2014","true","8.7"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","34","39","0","0"

I still havnt got all the mechanics down yet, but it is a engaging game. You have to think about precisely what you are going to do with every unit. I wacthed some olf lets plays dated 1 year ago and the game now is different as far as I can tell, more updates. I understand people are waiting for a 1.5 patch but ive found it a challenge.\nI started out as the Central powers and found the AI a good challenge, didnt finish the game, was getting clubbered by the AI in my first game, then switched to Entente(spelling?) etc, and found it just as challenging. This is my current game and ive managed to hold in Serbia though I am bieng wittled down. France was a fright but after tossing units, the milita type ones into the breech the germans started shifting east, and clobbered my Russian army before I could mass enough to make a imapct. Its in sort of a stalemate now.\nThe game has a constant sense of tension, as I commented above you have to THINK about each units move, the production at first glance dosnt seem that deep, but it is...because there is a finite limit where you will suffer for overproducing, and you also need to weigh tech development against this. I havnt played a complete campaign yet but I ponder all the points I spend.\nI will say this, the German fleet is too agressive early on. I destroyed thier navy off the coast of Belgium, some crusier units were still in the baltic and I wiped those out with my Russian fleet.\nThe submarine warfare aspect seems interesting, from both sides.\nAnyway the land warfare model aspect of the game is quite a challenge, this coming from someone who started wargaming when I was 10 years old. My most memorable victory was defeating our wargaming club sponsor, a US Army Colonel playing Napolean in SPI's enhanced version of the Battle of Waterloo.\nMy conclusion so far is this game is without a doubt worth what it is currently bieng sold for. I give it a wargamers thumbs up and a 8/10 rating.","July 26, 2014","true","32.0"," 40 of 50 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","40","50","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ice84NL/recommended/312350/","Ice84NL","Neverwinter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ice84NL/","199 products in account","This is an early review, as I only played the game for 5.3 hours at the moment.\nIn Commander: The Great War you either play as the Entente or the Central Powers. The war starts with just Austria-Hungary (Austria for short) and Serbia going at it. But within a few turns, other nations start to get involved. Eventually, you'll be taking charge of the land, naval and air forces of all nations of your alliance. As the Entente, that means fighting off a German invasion of Belgium and France in the west, an Austrian invastion of Serbia in the Balkans, a joint German-Austrian invastion of Russia and you'll need to keep your enemy at bay on the North Atlantic and Mediterranean. As time passes, your attention is needed in even more areas as more nations joint the fight. At the same time, you're in charge of unit production, research and logistics (in terms of: make sure you have enough industrial capacity to support your armies and keep some of it in reserve to actually build new units, repair units and upgrade units when needed) of each individual nation in your alliance.\n\nWe all know about the trench warfare of the Great War: millions of men trapped in trenches and mud for years with high numbers of casualties and little or no gains. I started this game with the tought: 'I'm not going to get bogged down in trench warfare.' Guess what: I got bogged down in trench warfare. Actually, soon I was happy I managed to stop the German and Austrian advances at all. I was happy the front stabalized and trences were dug (you can actually see more and more trenches on the map if your units stay in one place long enough). My western front is just as static as the western front historically was. The AI really looks at your frontline's weak spot and throws one unit after another at it in an attempt to break through your lines and encircle your units. My Russian front collapsed 4 times in the first year of war (even after it stabilized a few times), resulting in loss of units, one massive retreat, alot of lost ground and a giant hole in the Ukraine where a single German cavalry unit is wreaking havoc at the moment with only a few small garrison units in my cities to slow it down. I simply don't have any unit to spare to go after the German cavalry unit, since my Russian frontline is to unstable because of continued AI attempts to outflank me (and I'm not even using the high difficulty setting here).\n\nThe horrors of war also have a negative effect on your units' fighting efficiency. If your units are at the front for to long and get attacked time and again, their efficiency drops (even if you constantly repair the unit). It is absolutely necessary to rotate your units on and of the frontline. When a unit's fighting efficiency drops, take it of the line a few turns so the troops can get some rest. If you keep them on the line, eventually the unit will crumble and start to lose battles they would have won if they were rested. At times, it's better to put a rested garisson unit on the line instead of a regular infantry unit with low morale. It's small things like this that give this game an extra strategic layer.\n\nThe only thing I'm a little worried about is the way the alliances advance through the war. It appears that the alliances are set and the moments that other nations like Italy, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria join the war is (to a great extend) fixed. It would be nice to not play every game knowing Italy or Bulgaria are going to join at a certain side at a certain moment. Italy was a member of the Central Powers before WW1, so it would be nice to occasionally see Italy joining in with Germany and Austria-Hungary instead of with the Entente, just to keep you on your toes and force you to keep some units in reserve near the Italian border just in case. That being said: I must stress that I only played this game for a few hours so far, so it might well be possible that the alliances might turn out not to be as set as they appear, but for the moment they appear to be set. Time will tell.\n\nSo far I'm very happy with this game and it will propably keep me busy for a long time. It gives me a challenge I usually only get from Paradox games like Hearts of Iron. If you even have a slight interest in WW1 or like a strategy game with a challenging AI, this is a great game for you.","July 26, 2014","true","19.2"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","25","28","0","0"

If I attack in the north can I break through and surround the enemy and win the war?"\n"Is that a gap in the enemy line, or do they have plenty of men just out of sight that would destroy me if I advance?"\n\nThese are some of the many very exciting questions I had to ask myself while playing this game.\n\nIf you enjoy strategy or using your mind to win rather than your ability to click buttons really fast, then this game is for you.","November 3, 2014","true","21.9"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","25","29","0","0"

Here are some examples of the game design:\n1) Artillery was a major component of the war while air power was weak and slowly evolving.  In CTGW, it is reversed.  Artillery is useless and Air power, particularly bombers are insanely overpowered, almost nuclear.\n2) The Russian army which was a basketcase in the real war, is uber powerful in CTGW.\n3) As the Entente, the game won't make it to 1918, because the idiot CP AI does not defend the Italian Front!\n4) If you play the CP, you will be fighting a Russian army that is actually stronger than the German troops!  THe game quickly becomes a stalemate.\n5) The AI does stupid things like putting air units, trains, and artillery on the front line which gives you a big edge.\n\nIn short, there are much better designed games with better AI out there.  This game will provide you with some enjoyment initially but will end up gathering dust on your hard drive.  Save your money for something better.

The strategy wargame genre has a pretty bad (and in most cases deserved) reputation for producing opaque, dense, hard-to-understand niche games that appeal to a very specific and small crowd of history and military nerds. However, Commander: The Great War hits the formula perfectly, as a balanced, fairly transparent and easy-to-understand wargame that anyone can pick up and begin playing pretty quickly. The UI is fairly intuitive and well-designed (which already places it in a league far above most other "grognard" games), the graphics are solid, the AI is competent, and the pacing of the game is really genius.\n\nIn Commander: The Great War, you don't play an individual country - rather, you take control of one of the sides of the Great War (the Entente and the Central Powers). At first, this may seem a little daunting to the new player. "Oh crap, I have to control HOW many countries, and simultaneously at that?" This is where the pretty clever design comes in. As a new player, you're given control of the Entente, and on Turn 1 you have direct control of only... Serbia, a small but compact nation in the Balkans where the whole tragic story of the Great War started. Since at the beginning you're only managing the one country, it's easier to get ahold of simple game concepts before you're tossed headfirst into one of the biggest conflicts in human history. A turn or two later, and some other allies join in, gradually building the game up in scope. You never feel like you're in over your head, and that's why I say the pacing is great. As the game goes on, it gradually adds more and more layers, and you never feel like it does so before you're ready for it.\n\nThe game reminds me a lot of 2x2 Games' "Unity of Command" (also available on Steam and also recommended), which takes a similar, approachable, and downright fun approach to the strategy wargaming genre. Both developers have taken the core of these complex strategy games, chewed them up, refined them into their most fundamental parts, and dropped them into a package that is accessible, unintimidating, and a load of fun for newcomers and veterans alike.\n\nAll in all: if you're interested in getting into turn-based strategic wargames, or are a World War 1 nerd, pick up this game. It's strangely addictive, and definitely scratches that "just one more turn..." itch.","July 30, 2014","true","7.2"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

I like CTGW and recommend it. Even though it cost a lot on Matrix, I feel I've already gotten my money's worth. I have played the 1914 campaign twice: once as the Entente and once as the Central Powers and had fun both times. I've probably spent around 20-30 hours on it so far and will continue to play it. I find it's a lot easier to learn how to play (+ has a more intuitive interface and is less overwhelming) compared to games such as Civil War 2 (which is still good), Time of Fury (which seems kind of meh so far), or Darkest Hour (which seems awesome, I just have not yet spent enough time on it in order to figure out WTF I'm doing). My previous favorite WW1 game was Strategic Command WW1 Breakthrough, but I now prefer Commander: The Great War. SC WW1 BT is still good, but I have more fun with CTGW. CTGW is simpler, cheaper, looks better, sounds better, has a better UI, and is faster to play (the turns in SC WW1 BT seem to take forever). If you like turn-based wargames, this one is a good one to get.

Best WW1 TBS game out there at the moment. The hardcore strategy meter for this game is mediocre, so you don't have to be a Gary Grigsby fan to enjoy this one. Average game takes about 20 hours to finish.\n\nLong review:\nCommander: The Great War is a turn-based grand strategy game (warfare, production, tech research) with panzer general style combat, that plays out on one map of Europe (no different maps for tactical battles) . You can play either as Central powers or Entente. Once a nation joins your side, you control all their assets.\n\nTroops consist of land troops (infantry, cavalry, armor, armored cars, artillery), air force (bomber&fighter), navy (subs, destroyers, battleships). Tech research is on those three fields (land,air,navy). Production is based on industry points received from cities (or trade ships if they reach harbour before sunk) and you can produce troops, rail network, ammunition production and naval transport capacity. You also get special generals to attach to your troops.\n\nThe game captures the trench warfare pretty well and especially on western front the lines tend to move slowly. The game is also pretty hard and I lost on the first try. The AI is pretty good and only on a few occasions I noticed stupid behaviour, like AI moving arty to the front lines. One big setback (IMO) is that the units gain no experience.","July 31, 2015","true","33.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

With the latest update however, this game has gone to a whole new level.  It is so much more robust and while ir always had a nice WW1 feel.  But the addition of so many more units and events have made things much more chaotic (that's a good thing) and much more intense.  This is especially true early before the armies dig in and settle into 'Meatgrinder' mode.\n\nThough the diplomacy is lacking (really none to speak of) there is still enough on the management side to keep you focused on utilizing your resources intelligently.

Here are the pros and cons so far.\n\nPros:WW1 theme. There aren't a lot of strategy games that focus on WW1, though the genre seems to have gained some popularity.\nNot too complicated. The Hearts of Iron series has more micro-management. An experienced wargamer will not have problems with the game mechanics, and might even think of it as simplistic.\nThe AI seems to be good. Definitely an important aspect of a strategy game. There are 3 difficulty settings: handicapped AI, balanced AI and privileged AI.\nTrench warfare. I guess this is one of the things that makes the game more immersive. (Historical) immersion is most important to me when it comes to games that are clearly based on past events.\nControl of nations. You don't choose a nation to start with, you control the nations that are part of the alliance you choose (Entente or Central Powers). So getting the (historical) allies into the war or avoiding the possible allies of the enemy to get into the war is necessary to win.Cons:Graphics. The graphics are not aweful but the developers could have done a better job. It's not ugly, but sometimes the menus or images are mediocre at best. In my opninion, beautiful graphics contribute a lot to immersion. There are no animations, it doesn't look very lively.\nRather little room for alternate history. Of course, the game focuses on World War 1, so winning the war with the Central Powers is the most alternate it could get. The strong focus is both its strength and its weakness. It is its strength because it doesn't have to take post-war developments into account that could make for an unbalanced end-game. Its weakness is reflected in the limited diplomatic options, which makes the game more linear.\nSummary/conclusions: the game(play) is not complicated, some may even find it simplistic. I expect the depth of the game to be in the skills of the AI. Graphics are not bad but could be better. Focus on World War 1 is really nice, but it lacks the possibilities that are present in a game like Hearts of Iron III.\n\n7/10 Zeppelins","November 27, 2015","true","2.3"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

This game is a challenging, well thought out and interesting addition to the turn based strategy genre. The game offers 4 different campaign starts, 1914, '15, '16', 17 and 1918. Each start can be played as either the Central Powers or Triple Entente. You take control of multiple countries, which may sounds troublesome and un-needed, though it actually allows for greater strategic and tactical depth. As nations join your faction, you the have access to that nations troops, research and production controls. The game features seperate panels for each nation within your chosen faction to choose production, research or check logistical matters. The AI is much improved in the newest 'beta' update, improving upon the gameplay. The gameplay itself requires more thinking than actions, you will ask yourself many questions such as "should i move up that extra hex?", "Should i divert troops to flank around and leave my front open?" These questions force you to really think about the actions you take. And trust me when i say it, you'll know for sure when you made a mistake. Though that is also the beauty of making mistakes in this game, you can right it, unlike some strategy games similar to this, once an enemy unit breaks through it is not game over, you can hold them off, adress the line, and push back. For anyone looking for a great Turn based strategy game set in WW1 with oppurtunity for replayabilty, making choices that mean something, for experienced strategists and amatuer tacticians alike, this is a must-buy.","November 29, 2014","true","28.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I had just finished listening to Dan Carlin's 18+ Hour long series on the first World War so my opinion is obviously not without its' biases. I'm usually not too big a fan of turn based strategy, but this one(and CIV5) are pretty fun. It's different from CIV5 in the sense that it isn't building based. You get a certain amount of income per country per turn depending on how much of your population you haven't drafted into your armies.\nThis game isn't like RTS games or CIV5 where you send your units straight into combat, trying to kill enemy units one on one. 90% of success in this game comes from positioning your units and stocking up artillery ammo for taking out one or two enemy units on there flanks and then trying to turn that flank in on itself.\nIf you like the WW1 theme and like grand scale turn based strategy I'd recommend this game, it is very satisfying after playing 6 hours on veteran as the central powers haha, beating back Russia into submission, swinging down and stomping out the Serbian rebels and all while holding back England France and Italy in the west.\nYou'll like this game if you're into almost chess like games, where time is really a factor, you play your units as best as you see fit and wait for the enemy to react, and vice versa.

I decided to give it another try, partially due to a prepaid gift card i got for Xmas and partly due to having just taken a very interesting class on World War I last semester at college.\n\nThere is so much to cover and i will likely miss quit a bit, so i highly recommend watching 'Lets Play' videos of this to get the idea. Also if you have specific questions, as i will miss alot, feel free to leave them in the comments of this review and i will answer as best i can, if i can.\n\nI would definetly have to recommend this game. There are not alot of WWI games out there that are not flight simulators, and this one is simple enough to appeal to the masses and, i think, complex enough to not be considered "dumbed down"\n\nThe game is all played on one large map, which includes all of Europe to the Urals except for the northern parts of Scandinavia. The map also includes well as North Africa, The entire extent of the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East at the time, as well as Western Persia, and the Eastern seaboard of the US and Canada. The war was fought in other places, like East Africa, but the bulk of the fighting did occur within the area of this map, so it is acceptable.\n\nBasically, you dont play as an individual nation, but as one of two sides:\n\nthe Triple Entente (Russia, France, Great Britian) and its Allies (Serbia, Italy, Portugal and others)\n\nOr the Central Powers (Germany, Austria Hungary, The Ottoman Empire and others that may join)\n\nAll the nations not in the war at the time you are playing are grouped together as neutral nations. But nations can join the conflict on thier own or by you declaring war on them.\n\nThe game gives you five options of campaign:\n\n1914: Basically the war starts the way it did, and you have until 1919 to achieve victory for your side, 118 turns max.\nWith this, you dont start with everything, you only start with the fighting between Serbia and Austria Hungary, then over a few turns, Germany attacking Belgium is added, then the Russian Attacks in the East.\n\nNOTE: As of this writing i have only played one campaign, as the Entente from 1914, and won in 1917 in two long play sessions\n\nThe other scenarios start at the begining of thier respective years: 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918. but all must be concluded by 1919\n\nIn terms of difficutly, there are three options with regard to the AI that will oppose you: Balanced, Handicapped (you have advantage), and Privliged (AI Has advantage)\n\nThere is not alot of unit variety, but that is fine as you are on strategic level stuff, so you wouldnt see elite units and such.\n\nMy one complaint regarding units is actually with the one Unit you cannot recuit: Small Garrison. These start in your cities, at least with the 1914 campaign. In my opinion, they are too strong and should be alot easier for regular units to defeat, especially if they are isolated.\n\nAlso there should be ways to more easily destinguish between normal cities and fortress cities, as there were a few times where i took a city and an event popuped saying that city had been taken and that it was a great fotrress city.\n\nDiplomacy is weak, the only action you can take against Neutral nations is declaring war. There should be some way of trying to convice neutral nations to join your side, especially since there is a bar showning the nation's view toward your side (sympathetic, neutral, resentful).\n\nBeyond this i recommend reading the manual and watching Let's Play videos to get more of an idea, as i know i am going to miss stuff.\n\nBottom Line, i defienetly recommend Commander:The Great War, just be prepared to get sucked into long playsessions like i did, if you want a quick game, do the 1918 campaign.\n\n","January 10","true","22.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

It is also challenging as well, the AI hammers your armies every chance it gets. For me it not only turned into trench warfare on the Western Front but on the Eastern Front as well. Here is how my first game went.\n\nWhen Russia joined the fray things were pretty tricky in the east. I lost Warsaw immediately before I could get enough troops to the border and spent the next two years trying to retake it even though it had bordered three of my units with several replacement units handy, including artillery and bombers. When I finally retook it I had to deal with the city behind it (which took up a majority of my time there.\n\nFor Serbia I had to keep just about everything on Serbia's borders just to hold out the Austro-Hungarians and the Germans. Things were like that for so long I actually got worried by the second year what I would do when Bulgaria joined the war, with everything to the north and west fighting the Germans and Austro-Hungarians after all.\n\nThe Western Front went pretty similar at first to how the real WWI went. I lost most of Belgium immediately, the French troops I had handy to respond were pushed back quickly and I lost Brussels, Liege, and most of Belgium rather quickly. The only place still in Allied hands by the time the front stabilized was Antwerp that was completely surrounded. The French and British Armies were pushed so far back that by the time the north stabilized they had reached Dunkirk. In the South things were hardly better. After being pushed all the way back to Verdun, and sometimes beyond that where they got close to Paris, things stabilized and turned into WWI trench warfare. Most of my troops were concentrated there in fact and the fighting grounded slowly on.\n\nWhen the Ottomans joined the war I was at least ready. I had deployed British troops to Egypt and, after losing some inital ground, pushed my forces into the Ottoman Empire. I had managed to take Jerusalem rather quickly and the crushed most of the Ottoman military. I would have actually laughed at the low amount of troops to the south if it wasn't for something that had completely slipped my mind: Russia had a border with the Ottoman Empire. Since I had forgotten that I sent all my troops to the Russian-German/Austro-Hungarian front. I managed to react quickly to contain the damage yet I had lost quite a bit of ground. The only reason why things weren't worse was because of the Garrisons and that I had a couple infantry divisions close to being finished.\n\nOverall I did manage to win the war by Christmas 1915 but I have a feeling that was because I tried it on the lowest difficulty, and the fact that by halfway through 1915 I had sunk the entire German Navy probably helped (morale and all that). In my opinion it is a must buy if you want something to kill time but also have you think.","October 19, 2014","true","16.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

But World War I introduced the weapons and tactics that dominated the titanic struggle that was World War II.\n\nCommander: The Great War is a "grand strategy" game that pits you as a leader of the Central Powers (Austro-Hungary, The German Reich, Turkey, Bulgaria) or the Entente Powers (Serbia, Belgium, France, Russia, United Kingdom, Italy, Romania) in the European, North African and Middle-Easternt theatre of operations. As such your main task is to defeat the opponents on the battlefield but you must also pay attention to your industrial otput, available manpower and research facilities. Gameplay is pretty straightforward and easy to master and even strategy novices should have no problem in being good at the game.\n\nCTGW has a major problem in the field of AI as it tends to fall apart pretty quickly and pulls major offensives in secondary theatres while leaving their main frontlines critically exposed. I've managed to be victorious as Central Powers in 1916 by taking Paris in the West, Venice on the Italian Front and conquer Baltic provinces, Byelorussia and Kiev and Odessa in the East as AI concentrated its forces on the Apenine peninsula and Caucasus. Playing for Entente I was able to completely annihilate Central Powers in 1917 as Germany and Austro-Hungary kept sending reinforcements to the East leaving Western Front to collapse under the pressure of my armies. AI is also bad at utilising Entente preponderance in terms of warships as it gathers them in small flottillas instead of grand fleets making it easy for Central powers to defeat them in small engagements.\n\nSo playing CTGW against an AI is really not a challenge but thankfully there is PBEM options for those who would like to test their mettle against a human opponent. My frend and I have been playing for 4 days and in 1916 the war is still undecided and there have been epic offensives and counter-offensives on all fronts, fortresses and cities besieged and sieges lifted etc. This has been one of the best multiplayer strategy experiences in my gaming career.\n\nSo Commander: The Great War is somewhat a mixed bag. The basic premise is sound but it is let down by lackluster AI. Also, while there is a Diplomacy tab in game, it only contains overview of which country belongs to which alliance and players cannot spend any points in persuading countries to join their alliance. Also replayability factor is somewhat limited as AI always pulls the same historic maneouvres (Germans implement the Schlieffen plan in 1914, Russians launch offensives against East Prussia and Galicia, Allies land at Gallipoli in 1915 etc.) but multiplayer option lifts the game from the plains of mediocrity to the heights of a very good grand strategy. It still is no Hearts of Iron or Europa Universalis but it can stand proud on its own.","September 5, 2015","true","3.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Nice options for research, a tough-enough AI player and easy enough to pick up on that you will be playing very quickly.  You should still read the manual before you get serious about investing in a full campaign.  It's brief enough to not be a complete bore and there are some important tips in there.\n\nIt can be won on both sides.  I was able to win as the Entente by Aug 1916 and as the Central Powers in Dec 1918 (Balanced setting on both).\n\nThere are a few small problems to be aware of that other reviewers have pointed out:\n1) Save regularly because there is no taking back a move.  If you accidentally open a hole in your line and can't plug it, it can be  game changer.\n2) There is a small memory leak that will build up until about every 20-25 turns the game will rather suddenly screach to nealy a complete halt.  Save the first turn you see that slowdown because the next turn could take hours!  Best bet is to save and restart the save file about every 15 turns.\n3) Don't expect France to surrender quickly after Paris falls.. or after Bordeaux also falls,,, or after all of mainland France has fallen.  This part seemed a bit much although by the time it happened  it was merely an annoyance.","August 18, 2014","true","186.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I find the game to be suprisingly well put together, especially for balance.  Yes the Entente undeniably find things easier, but the Central Powers can win.\n\nA particularly strong point is each nation within the alliances has it own production & technology and unlike other games this is not overly cumbersome to manage.\n\nA potential downside is the degree to which you are railroaded into a historical timetable with Italy automatically attacking Austria every time, something that was far from historically certain, much the same with Turkey.  Of course, without this, the game balance would shift badly.\n\nIf you liked turn based staregy and fancy something with a Great War theme then this is an excellent game.\n\nBecause of my love of games which involve less clicking & more thinking added to my Great War enthusiasm I am giving this one a score of:\n\n5/5","August 17, 2014","true","105.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Also reviewers mentioning balance problems mostly posted before the recent 1.6 patch which I base my experience on.\nCTGW is a nice addicting hex-strategy title, which provides a depth approximately compared to the Panzer Corps series (being totally different though). It is not too heavy to chew to keep you occupied a whole evening to do one turn. Still it isn't too light to bore you. The shallow approach (compared to grand strategy titles of a Gary Grigsby level) turns out to open up the chance of plenty of quick fun. The well known one-more-turn-desire might catch hold of you very soon.\nPeople complaining about not succeeding in any kind of Blitzkrieg advances should remember this game is all about WW1. This means trench warfare and the chance to see frozen fronts for long durations of time. It is possible to break through after all, but this requires some patience and the application of accurate forces.\nOverall after the 1.6 patch I perceive the devs did a very good job in balancing forces. AI may have some flaws but like any other strategy title you will find the real challenge in a play against another human only.\nMP is handled via external servers very similar to PBEM. It is Igougo sending your turn to the slitherine server. The server then informs your opponent by mail. The Opponent then logs into the game which loads down your turn, and so on.\n\nConsidering the mid segment pricing I can without hesitation recommend to get this, if you generally like strategy titles and also share the interest to lay hands on the remarkably underrepresented WW1-theme.\n","February 4, 2015","true","143.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

Being a long time grand strategy gamer and somewhat of a fanatic of the genre, I am torn between rating this game coming from that perspective and from the perspective of someone else.\n\nFor a die-hard strategy gamer this game probably won't satisfy your desire for WW1 combat on the PC. I will however recommend you purchase the Ipad/whatever version if you have one of those devices, as I can see it easily being a favorite to play when you are on the go. I would also recommend it to the die-hard people for online matches when you want to squeeze a match into a busy or exhausting schedule but don't have the time to get invested in something deeper.\n\nFor the average strategy gamers I easily recommend this game. It does a fairly good job at modelling WW1 warfare, though it is still a little too fluid on the Western front and advances are too easy in the East. There are a number of interesting tactical choices to make, though strategically you won't find yourself doing much different from what happened historically. The graphics are nothing too impressive, but there are some nice bits of flavor like how the unit cards display each nation's unique uniforms and the changes they experience as you progress in tech (picklehaubes to stalhelms for instance). I can also see  newer strategy game players getting a lot out of multiplayer.\n\nSo to sum it up, if you are a die-hard strategy gamer get this on a mobile platform and look for something else on PC, but if you are new to strategy games or maybe totally unfamiliar with First World War tactics, events, history, you should have a blast.","April 20, 2015","true","54.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is initially difficult to get into as at first glance it appears as if someone just made a WW I themed Panzer Corps mod which was unnecessarily diffici;t and excessively expensive. However, this can be an extremely addictive game once you have given enough time for the mechanics to become sufficiently intuitive. It does reproduce the deadlock of the western front quite well, while also allowing for large scale encirclements and manuevering in the east. It also attempts to simulate other broader concerns such as production and technological research (the homefront). The British naval blockade is also featured although I think it does understate the damaging effects of the Turnip Winter in Germany. The only other flaw would be the representation of the early clashes in 1914 as it was hard to really obtain any result which appeared to resemble the Battle of the Frontiers or Tannenburg. However, after the first clashes it does get quite interesting and difficult to tear oneself away.\nI recommend this game wholeheartedly to anyone who would like something historical and on a grand scale and I hope that you have found this review both useful and strangely written.\n\nSincerely\n\nSomeone\n\n","April 2","true","27.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It’s a good game, but there is a major balancing flaw with the AI. They have a mass production that you the player can’t compare to I played so I had a handicap and it was ridiculous how many enemies appeared on the map, they had a steady stream of infantry being produced where as I try and keep up with a chain of garrison productions anything else and I’m at a disadvantage. Again don’t get me wrong, it has a few hidden gem traits that you don’t see in many games, but it’s not balanced good for in this game such as the science branch like you have to build labs which costs upkeep and an initial cost as well the first lab from unlocking each one puts a lot more pressure than you need. So for the industry points they are needed for too many things such as troops which cost a lot, the tech tree labs, the trading, trains, and ammo system. And this makes it extremely hard to keep up in troops and tech. Another problem I see is like I said, the AI is ridiculous in the fact that they are able to field far more troops than you can even hope to produce as well as the strength of these troops, 3-4 turns after the Russians joined the war they had almost 20 infantry units and trains on the border, which Is extremely dumb when they are supposed to have a slow mobilization same thing with the Serbians I pressed my Austrian troops along the border and they were fortified so seeing a wall of Serbian troops pushing back my wall and outnumbering my wall of garrisons which is all I was able to afford to try and field enough to compete. The repair system is too underpowered for you to be able to use since it costs so much to repair troops and with the AI’s power it like destroys your lines before you can repair. Than the AI will repair frontline troops and get a like 4-5 hp each unit and I get 1 or 2 hp. So far I mentioned a lot about AI but let’s go before AI when the nations are introduced, each time my enemies gained another I felt a sudden hate go through my body seeing a full line of troops against the sparsely spread out troops if that from the nations that joined my side. I know I was looking for a lot more, seeing games of a similar style to paradox interactive games, but this war let alone game deserves a lot more attention than was given. A few things I wish I had was the ability to setup fortifications with engineers so that my lines might actually hold with garrison troops while enemy infantry rushed me and this could be in the form of prebuilt trench lines to areas that were meant to be no man’s land filled with mines, barbed wire and other things you have researched instead of lines of trench that are there until a group is pushed far enough away that they aren’t filled and then they disappear which should not happen seeing as there are trenches that still show today from world war 1. Maybe setup fortified arty positions that would be able to rain down on enemies, but that would demand a spot stack so multiple units can be on the same tile, maybe even make it up to 5 units or something with different units taking up different amounts of space.  So all in all it’s an okay game. But I refuse to recommend it until they have it a better than it currently is. So where as i enjoy it to a point, i think it can be exponentially better.","July 28, 2014","false","19.3"," 24 of 49 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","24","49","0","4"
