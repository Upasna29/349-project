They don't add anything to it except for horrible steering (which is done with the touchpad). They basically just use the motion controls as a controller and not for motion. They only have them in it so they can say they use motion controllers. You do not steer with the controllers, you use the track bad. For power ups and boost you also just press the touchpads. While the tracks are nice to look at, they are short and are basically just flat ground with nothing else. If you are looking for motion controlled mario kart then you are looking in the wrong place. Maybe with future updates they will make them better but I doubt it since this is not even a early release or alpha or beta.","May 21","false","0.7"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","1"

I tried racing and my driver kept steering off in different directions even when not touching the Vive touchpad.  Conversely, it would sometimes stop steering even when using the touchpad.  There also doesn't appear to be any support for driving wheels, whereas the Rift version advertises that support.\n\nThere is also no in-game representation of the Vive controllers even in the menu.  This makes it difficult to know exactly where on the track pad you are pressing, since you have no visual feedback, but they still divide the trackpad into multiple buttons.\n\nIt's disappointing how something as basic as getting the controls wrong can break an otherwise promising looking game.\n\nUpdated: I tried it with an Xbox 360 controller and that worked fine.  It was actually controllable.  However, the game did not specifically indicate it could use an Xbox controller; the custom controller setup also only seems to work with the Xbox controller but not the Vive controllers.","May 20","false","0.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

Game says "Press A!" expecting you to know what "A" should be. The biggest issue for me, though, is that after just a few seconds into the race, the trigger to accelerate stops working and I can only go backwards.","May 23","false","0.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I get motion sickness easy but before you get this)\nTry your self in the following free games: "InMind VR" and "InCell VR".\nIf you get motion sickness from these, then you will most likely have the same problem here.\nIf not, This game could be fun.\n\nControlls are not made for the Vive controllers they are ported, wich means game will tell you to press A, B, X, Y, LB RB and so on (I could not find a way to change this).\nYou will not stear with the controls as VR would suggest, insted turning left and right is a button press.\n\nTo me, these 2 points are game breakers.\nThis is the first negative review i have written for VR but feels that others should have this in mind when bying this game.\n\nThere is probably alot of content and the game looks fun but I just simply can not play this due to the motion sickness.\nHopes this was helpfull.","May 20","false","0.1"," 25 of 53 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","25","53","0","13"
