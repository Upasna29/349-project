I backed this game for the basic game tier during the Kickstarter and it was more than worth it. Quiplash is essentially Cards Against Humanity with just the prompts, because of this the game has a lot more longevity to it because people aren't likely to have the same answers, limiting it to two people a prompt at a time also helps this. It's also really stream friendly, there is a new option for delayed responses to account for stream delay and if there are more people than the eight person limit then those people can join as audience members who can help sway votes. Overall I feel its a lot more fun than Fibbage and Drawful, though both were good so that's saying something. Jackbox also plans on releasing DLC for more prompts and I will glady pay for them.

If you own the game you become the center of attention (even if it's not your party!)\n\nThis game only requires 1 person purchases it and you have at least 2 friends.....I hope you have more.\n\nQuiplash is an amazing addition to your party games and you can get everyone involved. The audience feature is a nice touch, this allows the main 3-8 players to play the game and submit answers while the audience get to vote on the witty nonsensical answers. More often than not, the audience is the game changer, you don't know who wrote the answer until after voting. This game is best played with friends where you can use crude humor in your answers, unless of course the rest of your family doesn't care.\n\nBut just in case you want to play with your 2 year old cousin there is a family-friendly mode that you can play (note: this still requires you to play at that level)\n\nYou can play at home, at a friends house, at a stranger's house, or over the internet. Quiplash can help you engage with your audience for you streamers out there or you can play a private online game by using Skype with Screen Share.\n\nThere should be Quiplash DLC coming out.

The best way for me to describe this game would be a cross between that game and You Don't Know Jack - the potential for fun and fiendish answers from the former (and voting for the best responses) and the round structure, style and tone of the latter.\n\nPlaying on PC as a participant, a bit tricky to figure out the mechanics at first and definitely requires someone to be streaming the main 'game' window for the best experience when playing with friends. In my experience I ended up having one browser window streaming and another window alongside for submitting my answers. But once getting past that brief setup, it's fairly easy to play and allowed for a whole lot of laughs. The functionality of being able to invite in friends without having them to own Quiplash themselves works great to quickly introduce others to the game and gather lots of friends to play at once - simply click a link, enter a 4 letter passcode, and you're in - nice and simple.\n\nHaving played via my web browser the only small complaints after playing some matches were some questions and votes cutting out before the round countdown finishes, though I haven't played enough to know for sure if it's the game itself or something on my end causing it. Also haven't played enough rounds yet to know the number of questions the game has currently, but after playing about half a dozen rounds today I had no repeated questions and I assume the DLC option will allow for add-on packs in the future if need be.\n\nBasically, i'll sum things up with this: a little tricky functionality for first timers, but get past that and it's simple, loads of fun, easy to share with friends and if you want to actually buy the game, a fairly cheap price.

Quiplash is a party game that is supposed to be played with 3-8 players locally, but it's possible to stream it to allow people online to join in. Each round there is are two "Quips" with blank spaces for the players to fill in. Once everyone has entered their Quips, the rest of the players vote for their favourite answers. With no right answers, the game has infinite replay value and the laughs will continue for a long time. The Quips are funny, but player answers can make them hilarious if they are witty enough.\nOverall, this is a fun game and great to play with a few out-of-control friends.

Ten $ for one of the most entertaining party games out there.

JPP2 is brilliant and all, but what if you just wanted Quiplash, or if you didn't have $25 to spend on a game? That's where the solo release of Quiplash comes in. Sure, it might not have all the same prompts that the XL version has, but it's a great game regardless, and even with repeat prompts you should be able to think of different answers the second time around. I would recommend the Party Pack over this though, assuming that you can afford it and that you want the other games it comes with.\n\n[ORIGINAL REVIEW, OCT 18 2015]\nQuiplash is a fantastic game, no doubt about it. My circle of friends and I have had some great laughs playing this, and I would recommend it to anyone. So why, then, am I giving it a thumbs down? It's simple really. There is no reason to buy this game with the release of Jackbox Party Pack 2, which contains Quiplash XL. As for everyone who already owns Quiplash? Too bad, you have to pay for the whole thing.
