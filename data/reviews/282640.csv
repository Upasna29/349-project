In LOST ORBIT you play as Harrison, a maintenance worker who has become stranded in a distant solar system after his ship and is now trying to find his way back to his home planet. As you travel through the four solar systems the game has to offer you'll dodge asteroids, travel through wormholes, collect obtanium crystals and much more.\n\n+Great graphics\n+An engaging story which is fed to you by the narrator over the course of the game\n+Outstanding narration\n+Simple and responsive controls (I played with a 360 controller)\n+Quite a few different upgrades to buy with your obtanium, all of these introduce new mechanics and then build upon them\n+Forty levels across four solar systems, each solar system being very different to the last\n+Quite a lot of replay value if you're the kind of person who wants to get a gold medal on every level\n+Good balance of open spaces and 'not so open' spaces\n+Reasonably frequent checkpoints\n+It's set in space, who doesn't love space?\n+Fantastic sound track\n\n+/-What medal you get depends on three factors: Time, Amount of obtanium collected and Number of Deaths. I found the Time limits for the medals to be a little too strict, especially if you have to restart a checkpoint, but others might like the added challenge\n\n-I felt the ending was a bit abrupt\n-In most levels I experienced the mouse cursor flickering on the screen which was not only very distracting but it also seemed to decrease performance\n-Playing LOST ORBIT can get a tad bit frustrating if you get to a section of the game where you keep dying over and over again without being able to progress\n\nVerdict:\n8\n\nA great fast-paced space action game with great graphics, an engaging story, a fantastic narrator and simple, responsive controls. If you're looking for a fast-paced game or you just love space then I suggest you pick this one up.\n\n***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***\n\nEl K.","May 19, 2015","true","4.6"," 58 of 68 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","58","68","6","8"

The perfect case scenario is our hero, “Harrison.” His job is to go from one communication relay to another in deep space and patch them up. Everything was going as planned, working on the relay, until a big bang occurred and destroyed his vessel. Stranded in deep space, equipped with his suit and jetpack, he has to make his way back home.\n\nLOST ORBIT is a fast-paced action game set in deep space where you play “Harrison” and need to find his way back home through 40 levels in 4 Solar systems. In each level, you will have to collect all Obtainiums (pink crystals) and make it to the end of the level as fast as you can with no deaths in order to be awarded platinum badges and you will received additional Obtainiums by doing so.\n\nYou will be able to use the collected Obtainiums to upgrade your equipment such as: Mega boost – which combine booster fuel, recharge and speed – Defensive: ability to reverse your thrusters and get additional bombs – Utilities: Barrel roll and magnetise (drag the Obtainium crystals towards you from a distance).\n\nThe gameplay is absolutely brilliant; fast, fluid, with a large number of close encounters with asteroids, from which you will come out . . . . let’s say . . .  dead!  I really enjoy the one where the impact is so strong that Harrison’s skeleton ends up flying all alone in deep space. However, if you use all the tricks - barrel roll, mega boost or the bomb at the right moment - you might well finish the level without dying!  However, if you are as good as I am, you will be very grateful that each level has several checkpoints. If you die, you will start from the last saving point.  Also, you will be able to use orbital boosts, pulsars, ramps and more to reach the end of the level rapidly or die once more!\n\nPlenty of replay ability in this game especially if you want to achieve the platinum badge; it is hard to achieve, to be honest.\n\nThe controls are very responsive and I would strongly recommend playing with a gamepad. Great graphics, splendid soundtrack and the story is very well narrated.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great graphics\n-	Splendid gameplay and good replay ability\n-	Controls are good and very responsive\n-	Good soundtrack and great narration\n-	Challenging\n-	Achievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Hard to get platinum badges\n\nLOST ORBIT is marvellously executed. Just splendid! Come on Ladies and Gents, jump into orbit and help our friend Harrison!\n\n9/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

I bought thinking it could be fun for a little while...\nAnd indeed, the game is fun, you fly, you die... you try to speed through debris, you die, you race, you die...\nWell, you die quite a lot in this game !\n\nBut outside of the gameplay, it's not what really caught me in the game, what caught me was the story of an unlikely friendship between man and machine !\nThe story is told from the eyes of the machine yet you control the man who never say a single word by himself but you kind of grow fond of the probe following you and telling the story.\nIt's the only thing that made me finish the game so damn fast ! I always wanted to know what the little probe would tell about our journey together and our growing friendship... I got really attached to the probe and I was sad the game ended... I wish the probe would talk more than it does already because I felt the level was empty when there weren't any speech.\n\nThe voice actor is quite amazing, he does a really good job and this is what gave the game it's beauty and the will to go on to the very end.\n\nIn all, this is a pretty little gem for just 10euros (or your regional equivalent), gameplay is fast yet relaxing, there isn't too much content (story and time trials), the great music goes from calm and relaxing to a more upbeat rythm and the story is really well made yet not too consistent.\n\nThere is really nothing to be upset about this game, it delivers right what it promise and probably a little bit more than expected.","May 15, 2015","true","4.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

I absolutely love it. I find everything about it great:\n\n-Going at high speeds through pulsars and gas giants and gaining even more speed\n-Dodging obstacles left and right and zipping through debris\n-The unique mechanic of being able to go from one side of the screen to the other\n-The variety in solar systems (Thier colors, debris, and art style)\n-Beautiful art style that is almost like a cartoon but is really quite amazing\n-The music in this game is absolutely amazing and fits it so well\n\nOne thing that  I'm really enjoying about this game is the humble story line. I find myself happy whenever a segment of narration is about to occur, not only because the voice acting is phenomenal, but because the story is emotional and interesting and I find myself wanted to know what Atley has to say about Harrison and his humanly ways.\n\nI think that one of the reasons I was compelled to purchase the game was because I am very into anything astronomy. I think that this game stimulated that passion in a Sci-Fi sort of way. It isn't realistic game and it obviously isn't meant to be but that is what makes it so enjoyable.\n\nI highly reccomend this game to just about everyone, especially if you enjoy fast paced Dodge' Em Up games although I'm not a huge Dodge Em' Up guy but I think this game is spectacular.\n\nThere is one and only one negative thing I have to say about this game, and that is the shortness. but other than that its amazing\n\nOnce again I recommend this game to anyone, Its reasonably priced and is so much fun.

You can slowly float through and just avoid obstacles fairly easily and as you get comfortable and learn the levels you can speed it up, try and grab powerups, etc. When I get on a good run I definitely get a strong Sonic vibe, which is a good thing.\n\nI particularly love how you can almost feel the level designers trying to kill you in certain portions of the game. Clearly the level design has been polished over many iterations and it definitely makes me want to practice certain levels and segments to compete for high scores!\n\nAlso wanted to note that I love the music - great variety of styles but all feels very fitting to the associated levels in the game.","May 12, 2015","true","3.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Or maybe just in search of a way to not die every 15 seconds. Trust me, that'll be happening a lot. And whilst it may not sound like an attractive prospect, every time it happened I found myself immediately mashing the retry button without even a care - it's that sort of die-horribly/get-back-up-again gameplay loop that Super Meat Boy perfected.\n\nIt feels like a lot of love and care was poured into this game. The visuals and music are top-notch and the controls feel like they've been tuned to perfection. I do wish it was longer, or had something to keep me revisiting it beyond just honing my times, and that's my only real quibble. If the preview videos leave you thinking that it might be something you'll enjoy, the chances are high that you will.","May 23, 2015","true","2.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/recommended/282640/","daytondoes","Dayton Does ¯\_( ͡°Ꮂ ͡°)_/¯","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/","1247 products in account","Lost Orbit is a relatively casual speedrunner about boosting through space and beating your best time. The top-down 2D nature of the game strips down a lot of the depth (literally, hurrhurr) but the story, about a lone astronaut named Harrison struggling to make his way back home, was riveting enough to pull me through the occasional bout with monotony. Mechanics take far too long to be introduced but the writing and dialogue helped me to stick around for whatever was next. Will Lost Orbit accelerate to the top of your Steam Library? Or is it just space-junk? Let’s take a look.\n\nGoals are a clearly defined part of any speedrunning game, and this game does fine with laying out what is required for each medal. This should mean a fantastic replayability score, but the bottom is completely dropped out due there being no incentive to try for platinum across the board. If your ego requires that you do so then feel free, but with no global scoreboard you are literally the only one who will know about your mastery. Some levels are fun enough to try and replay, but others (usually the 6th stage of each world) are literally nothing but exposition and backstory.\n\nCharacter development is high in this game, and that’s a good thing because new obstacles and enemies take entirely too long to be introduced. For the first 30 minutes of the game I was circling around planets wondering if they were the only mechanic the game had to offer. Luckily that was not the case, and eventually I saw my first pulsar. I found myself absolutely flabbergasted. “They waited this long?? Wow.” So, pulsars will give you a boost and fling you in a given direction, which looks fantastic until you realize that you just auto-piloted through an entire section of the level.\n\nOverall, Lost Orbit was an enjoyable experience that I don’t see myself revisiting anytime soon. The story could work as a movie, so it seems a shame to frustrate the watcher by wrapping it inside a game that doesn’t develop quick enough. My patience was certainly tested with this one, but I am glad I got to experience Harrison’s journey. Once the mechanics are in place, the game becomes a rip-roaring space romp, but getting there will test your patience. A fine release, but hopefully the next title from the folks over at PixelNauts will have the screws tightened juuust a bit more.\n\nGameplay:\n\nControls- 8/10\nFun Factor- 6/10\nDifficulty- 4/10\nReplayability- 2/10\nInnovation- 8/10\n\nAesthetic:\n\nGraphics- 8/10\nMusic- 6/10\nSound FX- 7/10\nStory/Lore- 9/10\nLevel Design- 7/10\n\nFinal Score: 65/100 for innovation, controls, and atmosphere.\nSummary: Exceedingly laid-back space speedrunner with superb writing and story.\nVerdict: Speedrunners may not find the fix they crave. Story-lovers however, will indulge in the writing.\n\nFull text/photo review: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-lost-orbit/\nMusical reviewsical breakdown: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLu1zsA__lI","July 21, 2015","true","2.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a fast paced and fun game, counter-balanced with a surprisingly calm and sometimes even melancholy presentation: heavy on narration, a bit evocative of Bastion. The constant narration isn't always my cup of tea and it's occasional repetition at checkpoints can border on irritating but it works far more often than it falls flat and by the end of the game it had really grown on me. And it's backed by a lovely score. The music's light, pop-y, and electronic, but can turn up the evocative strings when needed. It's a great soundtrack, it pairs really nicely with the game and there's just enough variety to the tracks that it doesn't wear out its welcome.\n\nYour movement through levels is largely dictated by your interaction with an increasing variety of celestial bodies. You can orbit around planets to refuel your boost or skim their atmosphere to slingshot yourself forward, pass through gas planets to gain even more speed, get sucked through wormholes, be slowed by water planets to divert your course (and more). When the gameplay's at its best, you're getting pinballed around by all these different mechanics at breakneck speed, trying your best to find a balance between letting the planets dictate your path and dodging and weaving around deadly obstacles. The speed's satisfying and exhilarating and the moments of the game that fell flat to me were times when my pace had to be purposely slowed to avoid certain dangers, it doesn't feel great to have that fluidity broken. Death comes quickly and easily but the checkpoints are well spaced out and there's always a satisfying, Super Meat Boy-esque splat when you faceplant on something very solid or very sharp.\n\nThe art style is one of the things that really makes the game work. It's colourful and appealing and the game's usually great about providing clear visual cues and feedback as you play. There's an awesome amount of polish and cohesion to the art. It's consistent and clear. You might have some trouble discerning between benign debris and deadly asteroid chunks at times, but for the most part danger and safety are recognizable and understandable immediately.\n\nThe game's short (if you're zipping through and not trying to get a high ranking on the levels, you'll be done with it in under 3 hours) but it's well made and well priced and there's a good deal of time to be spent and fun to be had trying to climb the leaderboards.\n\nIt's well worth your time. Give it a shot!","May 12, 2015","true","3.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

For those curious regarding game length there are around 40 stages and it took me just over 2 hours to beat. If you're curious regarding the time trial mode there are ghosts as well as world rank leaderboards to compete on. The only thing I wasn't sure about in the time trial section is I was still prompted to buy upgrades so that could be a bit tedious if you don't want to collect all the resources to level up (you can easily skip the bomb and brake).\n\nMy only complaint regarding mechanics is that the mouse cursor sometimes still shows up in game for cutscenes (which I believe is a Unity issue), and you need to make sure only one controller is plugged in if you want rumble (I had one Xbox 360 controller, and one Xbox 1 controller plugged in and was able to play with the Xbox 1 controller, but rumble was on the 360 pad).\n\nPretty solid overall and was worth US $10.79 to me.","May 18, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
