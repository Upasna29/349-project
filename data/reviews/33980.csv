"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/33980/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Unpolished and seriously underrated, yet quite fun game on the mainstream theme - "zombie rampage". This time - in the distant town somewhere on Mid-West of USA. What I like about the game - is that it stays on the bright side of things. You know, the Zombie Games are usually Dead Serious. Not a bad feature, but all of them are so similar on the basic level, that it is absolutely no fun. Stubbs the Zombie was different, one-of-a-kind gem... But there are too little count of games trying comical approach on the zombie pattern - and that's a mile behind the cinematography. Which is strange, as generally games are far more creative with things, in comparison with Hollywood...\n\nNow, Pound of Ground is not something worth a long review, really. The "Hero" there doesn't have Ash Williams charisma and chainsaw, but other than that - it's the same type of guy.\n\nThe game starts a bit confusing, but quite soon you'll get a bat to crush z-sculls, then a car, a pistol, a shotgun, a long-ranged crossbow, and finally, a dynamite. Zombies will be upgrading as well, there will be monsters with distant attacks, sages-which-raising-hordes, and even bigger things on the dessert. Controls are a bit off, but only a little. In general, it is rather easy-going arcade game with semi-open world, some zombies to kill and some hills to jump with your red cabrio. Full complete in less than 10 hours, and way better aftertaste, than with so many other Zombie games. Especially when we're talking about smaller ones, like Dead Pixels, which so many people seems to like without proper reason...\n\nSure, Pound of Ground has many flaws, if you care to look for them - like strange name in the first place, followed by wacky start of the game, somewhat clunky controls and gameplay in general... and not-so-good code, as the game tends to crush every now and then, usually on the loading screens.\n\nOn the other hand, it is doing well the thing the games are generally made for - it is entertaining. I really like it just the way it is (except for unstable code, of course). It is short and fun, if a bit mindless, comedy action game about zombies. With great fusion soundtrack, which I really enjoyed.\n\nMy mark is 8/10. I usually play serious long-winded games, like epic RPGs and strategies... But sometimes you just can't force yourself to take the playtime so seriously. After 16h-work day, for example... And Pound of Ground is perfectly fitting that niche of short and easy action. There should be more games like that!","May 19","true","8.5"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","18","21","3","0"

Car driving mechanics are decent and I'm always a sucker for games that let you run over people/zombies. Plus using a Louisville slugger to launch zombies never gets old.\n\nThe story is god awful wacky with voice acting to match. The best thing about the story is that the developers obviously weren't shooting for something serious--and they did a superb job in that regard.\n\nOverall I have mixed feelings, but because the game crashes too much, I have to go with a thumbs down.

Literally.\n\nPound of Ground is a simple, open-world game, focusing on stemming the tide of a zombie horde in what is presumably the Western Wastes of the USA. The operative word here being "simple". You either shoot zombies, beat them about the skull with a bat, or run them down in your very own hot rod. There are little "metagames" strewn about, such as setting distance records for jumps in your car, or how far you can knock away a zombie with your bat, and these help stave off the monotony that sets in with every zombie-killing game.\n\nThe graphics are chunky, and the voice acting is evident of a development team whose first language wasn't English, but the music is pretty cool, and the cartoonish nature of the visuals make up for any cutscenes you'll inevitably want to start skipping.\n\nThe lack of polish on this game makes it hard for me to recommend to anyone when it's not on sale, but it's definitely worth at least a run through it's demo.","May 30, 2014","true","8.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

I'm a fan of zombie shooters but woof, this one is rough... This game has crashed roughly ten times randomly during gameplay, which never happens while I’m playing any other game. Nothing more annoying than driving across the map over and over again after a crash from loading another section of the map.. It's full of repetitive missions and tons of open field back and forth driving. This game is only worth it if it’s on sale (75% or higher) and or you need a good laugh because the AI in this game is so awful that it’s actually funny. 6/10 and I’m being generous.

Meaning that you can run a lot, everywhere, and find nothing. just plain fields.\nRun, or drive.\nYou got a car to enhance, by buying new engines, protective gear (SPIKES) And Nitro, helpful if you've got one of these moments where you want to jump from high cliffs. Careful tho, as your car is damageable and can lose parts of its body.\nDriving is quite enjoyable and responsive.\nYou got 5 weapons (One of them is a baseball bat which sends zombie flying scoring home runs).\nYou simply are an average hero who's going to save the world from a zombie invasion. Nothing more, nothing less.\nIt's an average game, with a debatable humor (I found it funny, tho.), go-there-and-do-this-then-come-back mission type,\na race, an entire city to free from mafia (Zombie).\nThe soundtrack is pretty good, it's jut a bit limited and you'll end up hearing the same song three times in a row, too.\nGraphics aren't the best, but cities and other places are, in my opinion, detailed. By detailed I mean that there are a lot of particulars that add a bit more dynanism and entertain the eye. I often found myself moving the camera around, trying to find something odd, unexpected.\nAfter all I still recommend it: calling it the worst game ever is overly exaggerated, although there aren't 5 bosses and the story isn't exactly well written. It's just an average game, enjoyable if you don't expect that every game you own is a GOTY or received a score of 90 / 100.\nThe only real advice I can give is to not buy it on full price, wait for at least 50% discount.","April 8, 2015","true","20.7"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

Maybe I inavertently got it during a sale, or perhaps I got it from a friend...I honestly don't know. What I do know is, Pound of Ground is definately one of most awful and boring games I have ever played in my life.\n\nThe story/script feels very uninspired, practically to the point where it almost feels as if there isn't a story at all...mostly just humor that feels forced and can be hard to listen to. The gameplay itself feels very bland and dull as well, considering practically all you do is run/drive place to place to engage in boring combat with zombies with whatever weapons the game gives you (mostly the baseball bat) and blow up the occasional generator. The pacing feels off at times, some levels are long and tedious, while others are rushed and sloppy. Oh, and sometimes the game just crashes for no apparent reason.\n\nReally the only redeeming factor to me is that some of the music is pretty cool, but the characters are too annoying and the gameplay is too repetitive and gets old quickly for me to enjoy it for long.
