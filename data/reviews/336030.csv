"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/recommended/336030/","orgelambart","Orge Lambart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/","5483 products in account","The roar of the engine, the smell of petrol in your nostrils, the blinding sun penetrating the windshield.  You sit behind the wheel of your five hundred thousand dollar race car, a pair of worn black sunglasses (The Rowdy ones) rest half-cocked off your nose.  You rev the engine, hearing it purr like a kitten, the heat raises inside the beast..  You feel trickles of sweat running down your face... No time to relax, it's only time to win, everyone knows "if you ain't first, you're last" (Ricky Bobby for the win)\n\nWell unfortunately the situation I described above won't be something you'll find in Race.a.bit, what you will find is a pleasant throwback to 80's gaming.  Devoid of all the modern trappings graphically overproduced piles of dung 3d racing games that exist to simply look good but have zero substance.  The simplistic nature of Race.a.bit will be a nice refreshing change of pace.  Kick back, and hit up some crazy tracks with your square or diamond shaped block.  Anyone born prior to 1990 will appreciate the game, people who grew up playing games like Super Sprint.\n\nPro's\nAwesome throwback to 80's racing games\nAI that doesn't cheat\nSimplistic and familiar controls for retro gamers\nGame accomplishes what it sets out to accomplish\n\nCon's\nThe music...\nThe need to create a separate account to save your high scores\nA minor issue with the timer on races,\n\nRecommendation\nI'll start off by saying if you were born after 1990, you won't like the game and should probably avoid it. (unless you are a fan of retro gaming) Anyone born in the 80's, when A.l.F from Melmac was attempted to eat the Tanner's cat lucky, or you were fighting for your right to Party, or you still think Cyndi Lauper is a chart topper with perfect pitch, you'll most likely love this game.  Playing it really took me back in time, I remembered all those amazing times in the 80's, it was prior to me donning my Hammer Pants and thinking Ice Ice Baby was cool, back when my life was atari and then nintendo, playing old school racing games, trying to beat the high score, trying to show (heck no multiplayer back then, so it was all about topping my brother) my friends who the king of the neighborhood was.\n\nSo I totally recommend you get this game, it'll bring you back to a better time, a time when video games weren't all about trying to pack cutting edge graphics and sound into the games with the worst possible gameplay.  A time when games weren't released broken and fixed later with patches, and certainly a time when games were released complete and not cut apart and sold back to us in mini pieces..","March 17","true","6.8"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

The game isn't a homage to retro games of old. HOWEVER, that's not to say you shouldn't buy this (after all, it comes with a level designer, go make your own). It's a great top down racer, almost like a 2D Trackmania. The gameplay is solid and the controls responsive. You'll find yourself resetting the track to improve your time and ranking.\n\nThe name is accurate, you'll race a bit, 5 minutes here and there, but I've found myself coming back to it again and again in short bursts.","March 11","true","0.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Are you ready to show your driving expertise and rise to the top of the world RACE.A.BIT leader board? Well, what are you waiting for? Jump in your car and go for the gold and the number “ONE” spot!\n\nRACE.A.BIT is a fabulous retro racing game with an excellent and easy level editor. RACE.A.BIT has 20 official tracks to race and the aim is to race around the track (usually 3 laps) as fast as you can to score the prestigious RACE.A.BIT Gold Medal. The first couple of tracks are quite easy but as you progress and unlock the other ones, you will have obstacles to avoid. In addition you will have to deal with different terrains and objects that assist you to go faster or help you to surmount obstacles. If you are extremely competitive (most gamers are), why don’t you try to knock the number one spot-holder on the leader board for each track. That would be a great challenge! Also, you can challenge a friend on a specific track, which is really fun too.\n\nThe level editor is actually very easy to use and fun. First you choose how big the map is. Then you design your own track (s). You decide where to put the obstacles (bombs, icy road, etc) and place assisting objects. Then, when you finish your “Grand Prix” track, you can test it and change it if needs be. I must admit that my creations were all over the joint, but I had a lot of fun. This aspect gives the game a huge amount of re-playability for yourself and for the community.\nThe controls are very responsive, the graphics represent well the 80’s era. Just great!!\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great retro racing game\n-	Fabulous and easy level editor\n-	Online Leaderboard\n-	Great game for all ages, fun and addictive\n-	Achievements & trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Soundtracks can be a bit annoying\n\nThis game reminds me of the game I used to play in my youth - I really enjoyed it!\n\n9/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes. Any opinions expressed are entirely my own!\n\nMORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HERE\n\nFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE\n","March 27","true","4.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","1"
