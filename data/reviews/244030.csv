It's a game, of sorts, but more than that, it's a tool for learning and understanding the challenges inherent in exploring a planet far removed from our own, as well as providing a toolbox to this end. A very well thought out toolbox at that, which includes a tech tree (recently added), Multiple survey sites, and even now includes Deimos.\n\nYou are placed in charge of the Mars Space Exploration Agency, provided a budget to build, launch and research landers, and rovers, and tasked with exploring and analysing scitentific points of interest. Completing these objectives nets you further funding. The game part comes from balancing the needs of developing technology and launching appropriate craft to the right sites.\n\nFunding -is- tight here, so it's very easy to box yourself in on the first few tries whilst you get the hang of how it all works. For that reason I really, really advise that you read the tutorials, go and do a bit of research on the web, and study the tech tree. Work out what you need to build, and apply an objective based approach to proceedings. This is not a game for anyone who isn't extremely patient and willing to invest in a concept which as an open ended project, is very different from pretty much anything that's come before.\n\nAs a niche product though, it should be applauded, because Bohemia has created a genuinely unique experience, one that if you've the time, the will and the inclination, provides a richly rewarding and deep journey, digging into the historical background of the Red Planet, and mixing a subtle element of managing your technology whilst exploring and unearthing secrets as you go.","November 30, 2013","true","13.1"," 157 of 183 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","157","183","0","1"

Loved it so much. Helped make mods for it..played it for hours...believed in its potential, but it is now being deleted after being on my favorites list for over a year. This game could have guided the inspiration for a whole generation of future scientists and explorers alike. Thank you Bohemia for yet another unfinished backwards display of failure. You had so much potential especially with the release of the blockbuster hit the Martian, but instead of devoting the proper time and money into making a work of art that could be recognized for generations this will end up in the junkpile of unfinished attempts at true gaming/training/simulation for space exploration and better understanding of our own universe. This is the perfect example of laziness, lack of dedication, and shortsightedness that exsists around us in our daily lives on this planet that prevent us from going any further as a species. P.S. At this point the game will not even function, and dont even dare try multiplayer now....seriously dont even bother trying...its not worth your time....so sad..\n\nRE: To Martin Melicharek (Project Lead)\n\nThank you for responding to my comment. I know that you the developers are working hard on this, and I want you to understand that my comments were not meant for you guys directly but specifically Bohemia Interactives lack of support to you 'the developers'. It seems to be a running joke that they give you guys just enough money and support to create something they can make some money off of, but when it comes down to having the support to actually finish something, or take it to the point of its full potential they fall short of giving the support that should be expected from a big name. I for one wish they would give you guys the resources necessary to make Take on Mars into the masterpiece it is meant to become. I am praying that your baby makes it to full adulthood, and not just that but goes on to be an example for generations to come and teach more people about our true destiny of exploration and daring bravery against the darkness of space. Get it back to a playable state, offer plans for a dedicated server tool at some point (i know lots of rewrite), 64-bit support, necessary texture compression, and I will gladly change my review. Keep up the hard work I for one believe in you guys.\nThank you, Thorn","May 5","false","68.6"," 132 of 149 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","132","149","2","5"

It isn't only about exploring Mars, but also its moons and asteroids. You can also operate rover on Earth.\n\nThe objectives are quite repetitive (ride there, shoot photos, analyze air, soil, rocks, take a sample, all this to get funds and unlock next levels of available hardware which you will send to Mars next), but it isn't a boring game. You need to be careful to not break the equipment (or wheels), and watch out for strong wind, as small rovers and probes are quite light and fragile. It's currently in active development, so some things may still change and a new content (like sample analyze results currently having a placeholder) will be added.\n\nIt's a great game for space geeks, people who like realistic vehicle simulators, and other people who want to view Mars from rover's perspective.","October 5, 2013","true","59.8"," 84 of 90 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","84","90","0","1"

The amount of detail and attention to realism is fantastic, making it really feel like you are controlling a rover on Mars. You visit actual locations on Mars, use actual scientific equipment to learn actual things about the geology of Mars. There is even an (optional) way to sync the game with the actual time on Mars, so you need to actually schedule your day around the 24.75 hour Martian day (like they do at JPL). Future versions will even include an (optional) light delay between sending and receiving commands.\n\nNo explosions, no aliens, no "story" other than building a successful Mars exploration program. There are countless games out there to provide your fix of those things. This game is different, and that is why i absolutly love it.\n\nThe gameplay IS quite repetitive, but one again so is the real deal. Drive a bit, analyse some soil. Drive some more, analyze a rock. None the less I find this very relaxing and engrossing, a nice way to unwind. Also, with Modding, there's no reason you can't break from realism and begin a long cruise around martian sand dunes in a dune-buggy while blasting "Road Trip" music from iiTunes/WinAmp/whatever.\n\nIf you are fascinated by Mars, like to keep track of what Curiosity is up to, would like to visit mars, and think it would be fun to drive a rover really slowly and drill holes into rocks (aka the real deal)... then you will like this game.\n\nSimply Put: The closest most of us will come to visiting Mars.\n\nP.S. The game is in Beta/Early access as of this writing, so for all i know in the future they may give you more freedom on what you can do, or include sci-fi ideas like a manned mission.\n\nP.P.S. Regarding some negative reviews here - keep in mind it is in Beta. Some of the things being complained about here are almost certainly going to be fixed or changed in time. If those reviews  scare you away from buying it, check back when it is completed.","December 23, 2013","true","75.6"," 75 of 86 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","75","86","0","0"

I want to like Take On Mars, but overall I don't find it a very engaging game.\n\nTOM wants you to play the game its way, or the highway.  My first play through and I spent all of my money to build a super-lander.  It had a robot arm, soil scoop, atmosphere sensors, the works.  I managed to get it down on the ground and thought to myself: "Whoo!  Let's do some SCIENCE!"  And then the game said, "Yay, you explored this region!  Now do it some more, elsewhere!"  Wait.  What?\n\nI wasn't able to use my robot arm or soil scoop.  My atmosphere sensor was useless.  The game had intended only for me to complete a set of explore-the-area objectives before it would unlock the next set.  I realized then that Bohemia Interactive had a much different idea of SCIENCE! than I did.  To me, spending my wad on an uber-science craft made sense.  Cram as much science as you can in a single big-budget mission so you can unlock more technology.   But I was thinking like a scientist, not as a game player.\n\nAnd that's where TOM lost me.  The game wants me to play it like a game.  I was expecting a simulator.  For something that bills itself as a simulator, I found this really disappointing.\n\nScience tasks earn me money, and I spend that money to research better science-making gear.   This system feels hap-hazard and slapped together.  Why not have a separate budget versus "science points" (much like in Kerbal Space Program)?  Why is the science objective-based instead of having "wells of science fact" that are tapped and eventually exhausted (again, like KSP)?\n\nIn fact, playing this game just made me want to play KSP instead.  Which is a real pity, because TOM looks great and it could be a real contender for introducing people to the act of managing a space program and how extraterrestial science works.\n\nI restarted my game and played it The Right Way and was able to upgrade to rovers.  I was excited at first, because I thought this was a chance to do something interesting.  Only to realize that "interesting" meant holding down the "W" key for hours on end, driving a slow rover across the Martian surface.  And this is where TOM completely lost me.  Suddenly, it wanted to act like a realistic simulator -- Oh you have to DRIVE AROUND to find interesting science!  In realtime!  With no automatic navigation system!\n\nAt that point, I just stopped playing.  I haven't bothered to unlock the next set of objectives, and have yet to set a human down on the surface of Mars in TOM, and that's a real pity.\n\nOh well, at least my science base on Duna is thriving...\n","June 28, 2014","false","10.0"," 177 of 240 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","177","240","2","14"

And the realism is the key to your enjoyment of this title.\n\nIf you want fast paced action on a future Mars then move along (I've seen posts saying it's boring, pah!).\n\nIf you're like me and absorb yourself into a sim about the current exploration of Mars, with all the slow analysis of rocks and atmosphere and the chance to take photos that look very similar to NASA pics that comes with that then buy this game, clear about a month in your schedule and prepare for a real, scientific and indepth exploration of our solar cousin.\n\nAs real as it gets.

You take on the role as a space organisation mission director, you choose which crafts are launched and assign them tasks which you have to do. (Atmospheric readings/ photographing crater rims/ taking surface samples.)\n\nOn the face of it this game is incredibly boring, driving a rover isn't the most fun, especially when it goes at around .2m/s! The game gets a lot more fun and satisfying with the pay-off, finally taking that photograph or completing the assigned objectives is such a nice feeling, I just can't put it in words.\n\nYou can also take control of the lander, controlling it's decent however this is incredibly difficult and best to do with a joystick which has had it's ratio of steering changed in the settings because turning how you think you would turn will almost certainly flip it over and smash it into the ground, often costing you 1000s of M$ from your space program, when I first done it it resulted in my space program's bankruptcy.\n\n\nI can't give this game too low of a score as it is still in development so please take that into consideration before purchasing this game.\n\n\n9/10, it does what it says on the tin and it does it well.\n\n\n> I've noticed little to no bugs\n> Great fun for someone who loves astronomy\n\n\nThe reason it is not a 10 is due to some minor issues which are not really worth mentioning.","November 28, 2013","true","9.1"," 72 of 84 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","72","84","0","0"

I nearly didn't bother buying it as I was put off by the association implied by "Take On", as I wasted money on the godawful Take On Helicopters (Sorry, but it is).\nAnyhoo, this game, even it's its early access form, is one of the most original, unique and strangely engrossing games I have come across. The only other game that has really attempted something similar is Mars Colony Challenger, and that isn't too bad considering it's a one man job. TOM takes it to the next level, with great visuals, a wealth of information, atmosphere and good old relaxing gameplay.\nThe single player Space Program game will not be for everyone. In it's early stages it basically consists of launching increasingly advanced probes and landers on Mars to gather scientific information. If you complete a mission you get extra cash and funding, used to create or research more advanced tech such as Rovers etc. It can get a little repetitive but you will learn more about Mars in a couple of hours of gameplay than you thought possible. Some of the missions are quite challenging, and instructions can be a tad unlear, but when you get it right, it's satisfying. When controlling landers and rovers there is a real sense of reality about it.\nThe second stage of the single player is the manned mission. Where you have to survive on Mars while conducting missions etc. You need to mine resources, build your base, so on and so forth.I have not started this stage yet, but I am assuming it somewhat similar to multiplayer.\nMultiplayer is where the game shines like a Martian sunrise, but it's also a bit of a dust storm at present too. The basic premise is players work together to build their colony. It is in it's initial release, so expect more depth to be added, such as the survival mechanics and resource gathering being required. When it is fully fleshed out, you will have one incredible sim which will encourage some great cooperative gameplay. Multiplayer games can also be saved to all clients, not just the host. Allowing for continuing session play on your favorite base/project.\nMultiplayer is flawed though. A severe lack of server commands for the host is just one problem. There is no way to kick players, and there are some idiots out there. They will spoil all your hard work, build crap you dont need, drive off in vehicles, change what you have constructed or just be general pains in the ♥♥♥♥. As well as a kick/ban function, the game lacks any means to remove items you dont require or make by accident. Often your well planned base can end up looking like a junkyard. Also, the object count can seriously impact framerates, so the less rubbish around, the better. There is also no way for the host to "lock" items in place. Whixh means that any idiot with a tool can tear things apart or adjust constructions that you have spent time building to your own design. It should be possible to disable the tool function for other players as seen fit, or to mark a construction as "locked" or "complete" etc so that no changes can be made without the host consent. As far as I am concerned, the host is the guy in charge of the mission, and should have the controls to achieve that.\nAll that being said, multiplayer is freaking awesome when you get a couple of good players. A random player joined my game and we spent hours constructing a base complete with control center, observatory and raised landing pad. We had an encircling balcony on the control center which was just missing some patio furniture. It was very satisfying, especially as we built most of it in the dark and didn't really know what we had accomplished until sunrise. Unfortunately the game then became somewhat unplayable due to the large number of objects. We felt like we were walking in slow motion and it took so long to accomplish anything else that we called it a day. Hopefully this issue will be addressed and improved by the Devs. Multiplayer is still in it's intitial release of course, but it's a good initial release.\nThe Dev team is very active, and take a lot of interest in their players. They obviously have a passion for this game that I am certain will see it constantly improving all the way to full release. They are not trying to milk cash from an early access game like some, and the price you pay for the game at present is more than worth it.\n\nAll in all I am rating this a 9/10. Innovative, interesting and well supported. Buy it!

There is a ton of potential here and I look forward to what the developers have in store.   This is a hard core sim, make no mistake about it.\n\nYou start with a small sum of money and essentially have to launch probes and gather data.  You can research upgrades so you can create better probes and eventually rovers.  It is slow going,. and you wil invest a lot of time just to get the payoff of meeting the mission goals.  That payoff is well worth it!\n\nYou will question yourself and make mistakes.  It can be a frustrating experience to build what you feel is an excellent rover for a mission, only to have it blown over when you make the mistake of landing in an area with hurricane force winds.  Ouch!  But you end up going back for more because you want to get it right.\n\nI have been playing with this the past few days and am hooked.

I really enjoyed the early stages but it there were a few bits that made it not quite right. But of course, it's early access. However I have to say that I have recently got back into the game and it has changed almost beyond recognition. The latest addition of multi player has added so much more to the game. I am sure other developers would have been tempted to release this as at the very least a paid for DLC.\n\nIt is still early access, the plan is full release in June, (I am writing this in Aril), and I think that all that needs to be done is a bit of polishing to make it a great game. That said, the way the game has developed in the recent months leads me to believe that there will be a lot more than just a bit of polish.\n\nThere are no aliens to try to kill or avoid, you need to eat, so you grow your own food; you can't do this till you have soil and water.; you can't get this till you have the right machines..... Oh, and your suit does not hold much oxygen. Run out at your peril!\n\nOne thing I would say, the controls are a bit hard to get to grips with. Rotating stuff to get it to line up has taken me ages!\n\nI love the vehicles available and the workshop integration is great with some really interesting stuff appearing.\n\nIn the space program side of the game you can choose to run in real time or game time. Real time, as the name suggests, runs at the right rate and so when you are told 45 hours to research the next bit of kit you need you have to wait 45 hours. Perfect time to drop to multi player for a bit I think :-) With game time you can advance time so you can play as quickly as you want. You need to develop probes, landers and rovers to map Mars and test soil, rocks and atmosphere.\n\nI must find Beagle-2 and give it a nudge to see if I can get it to start up :-)\n\nSo, yes I do most definitely recommend the game, it is great value, the devs are fantastic and all in all this is what early access should be like.","April 10, 2015","true","75.9"," 45 of 53 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","45","53","3","0"

The best part about manned missions thus far is they are strictly co-op, although there's talk of a future competitive mode.\n\nYour astronauts will attempt to build and maintain a base in manned mode - the ways to do this vary but in general you need three major resources - Food, Fuel, and Water. Food is self-evident so let's talk about Fuel - The only vehicles in the game that require ufuel are the MML, Cargo Truck, and Buggy, although this is likely to change as the game progresses. The fuel is a methane/oxygen electric hybird, that is to say they can run off methane or electricity. Newly built vehicles come with a full charge of electricity but you'll need to preform some basic chemistry to get the Methane and Oxygen depending on where you choose to play (Earth,  Moon, and Mars have vastly differing resources).\n\nThe best part about the game in my personal opinion is the resource management - it's all very realistic and highly accruate. Of course if your on Mars, you not only need Food and Water, there's also no air to breathe outside your craft - that's where suits and helmets come into play - they recharge when you put them in holders, and the oxygen drains away as you use them, the helmets and suits can be stored in inventory in order to preserve oxygen in sealed areas but in general this does not restore your tanks.\n\nNow there's three primary resource gathering machines in this game, one for rock, soil, and Atmospheres (gases) - Of these three methods there are about 10 - 12 different base elements that can be divided among the various conditions, and these can be refined into molecules that use the same elements into a new chemical. It's all very highly thought out.\n\nAlso with updates they have added the ability to "Scout" the maps for resource deposits which eventually become depleted (not for a *very* long time though - unless that sector was low to begin with). This is preformed with Hand Drills, and Gas/Soil Collectors and Lab Tables and Equipment.\n\nChemistry aside you may be wondering "if there's no air where's the Food Get the Oxygen?" - good question, Hydroponic Farms are available for construction which (as of yet) only produce potatos, which fulfill both your vitamen and calorie needs (collectively "Food" Needs) Other supplies can restore only one or the other but in general these are limited. Radition is also in it's infancy but it can already kill you. Water is just a simple matter of a water fountain and/or a space fluid pouch.\n\nSo all told Manned Missions can already be very cool but if your looking for the finished product you may have to wait a while - but the excitment of the idea is well worth looking into.\n\nSo...chemistry aside you also will want to provide a base to operate out of during the manned missions: There is a simple building block process that creates virtually any shelter you want (but be warned though simple it's easy to make mistakes at first and end up with a junkyard of shelter parts) My advice is find a mission on Mars say a multiplayer designed scenerio, and deconstruct their base to see how they are put together, this will save you alot of headaches in the long run. Nearly all of my 15+ Hours in this game have been spent in manned missions, however there is also a more primitive pre-manned phased called "Space Program" in which you don't send men, but machines to Mars, and it is reflective of budget and/or time constraints that the real space program faces. Space Program is like "Campaign Mode" for your everyday RTS - it's got somewhat of a goal, and there's specific objectives to meet, not always revealed all at once.\n\nScernerio's especially manned ones at the moment are kinda like a "Skirmish" if you've ever player C&C and know about the AI Mode, note though I've been using RTS comparisons to explain these things the game is very much based on a multi-perspective First Person Interaction Design. It's not fair to call it a FPS because there's no guns or weapons, but it's fair to say it's played largely from the same vantage point in manned missions.\n\nAll in all Great game lot's of details and it's not even complete.\n\nAlot of the vehicles are complete cases of Work in progress, and the potential is astounding as is the progress for the moment. If I do have one small gripe there's no schedule for updates, but considering the complexity of the game and other games that have tried that approach (ie Space Engineers) have made me realize good things take their time.\n\n7/10 Current Progress; If it lives to see it's full potential fulfilled it could easily make 9/10.\n\nReview Edited: 6/23/2015 to revise paragraphic flow (No Major Changes to content)","May 16, 2015","true","209.9"," 39 of 46 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","39","46","2","2"

It's not what it says on the tin.\n\nI bought it having looked at the screenshots, watched the videos, and read the reviews thinking it was a base building/ mars colonisation game. It's not at all.\n\nThe main campaign of the game is just sending probes to mars, which involves pick a location, then watch the probe land, then depending on the mission you click "Capture" to either take a photo or take a sample of some gas. After a couple of hours you can make a more complicated probe that requires you to press one or two other buttons.\n\nEventually you'll get a rover, which is just a tedious experience. In my experience it always ends up hundreds of meters from my target, which then means I have to remote drive it to the location. It travels so slowly that it can take 15 minutes just pressing the forward key to reach your destination. Sometimes your rover runs out of power so you have to wait for it to recharge from it's solar cells. This takes around 15-20 minutes, and you can't skip time, so this is a good time to make coffee and maybe have a sandwich, perhaps have a tidy up of the house.\n\nThere are some single mission "screnarios" that have astronauts in them, but having played them that component of the game seems pre-alpha. It is very clumsy and unpolished. Arms and legs clip through walls, nothing has tooltips so you don't know what is interactable and what isn't, an issue compounded by the fact there are no tutorials. The UI on the 3D printer made me laugh out loud, there is no UI, just a list of things you can make in no particular order.","October 8, 2015","false","11.2"," 104 of 157 people (66%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","66","104","157","10","4"

The available locations are created from real-life satellite data and look stunning from every perspective.\n\nIn Take on Mars you can build and control everything from landers, to rovers and even the "Zero-G Probe" that you can fly around Deimos and the asteroid belt (great fun by the way!).\n\nAlso, you can play the game in either "game time" mode which allows you to fast forward time when necessary (e.g. to speed up research or wait for better martian weather) or you play in "real time" mode where you will have to wait in real life.\n\nYou also get a variety of realistic science instruments to put on your vehicles and after you are done with your main mission you can keep doing randomly generated side-missions that suit your vehicle.\nThe rovers are the center part of the game and your rovers progress similarly to the real rovers: Your small rover is similar to the "Pathfinder" or "Sojourner" rover, the medium rover looks more like the "Spirit" and "Opportunity" rovers and your king of all rovers, the large one is close to the "Curiosity" rover.\n\nAlso they are working on a multiplayer build that allows you to build bases on mars and moon with your friends!\n\nAll in all I am really happy I bought this game and especially people who are interested in space exploration and simulation will like this game. However, you will have to show some patience at times because especially rover missions can be time consuming.\n\nIn short here are the pros and cons I can think of:\n\nPros:\n+really, really beautiful visuals and incredibly detailed landscape\n+realistic terrain, real sites on mars\n+procedurally and randomly generated side missions\n+campaign mode including tech tree and budget\n+editable scenario missions\n+explore Mars' moon Deimos and the asteroid belt as well\n+weather changes, you can get into dust storms\n+multiplayer is in the works\n\nCons:\n-You will need a lot of patience at times\n-might experience bugs at this point\n\n\nEarly Access Note: The game can be played very well at this stage, bugs only occurr rarely. It is resource-intensive though so you need a good computer to run it.\n\n","March 16, 2015","true","54.6"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","26","28","2","1"

The game also has a cool feature called the Mars Encyclopedia, a book in which you unlock pictures and paragraphs about Mars by completing missions. You can also build your own levels that you can play for custom missions. Another amazing feature of Take On Mars is the multiplayer feature. You can literally set up a server that is easy to connect to anywere in the world in just two clicks. Also, the develepors listen to the community's suggestions well, and they update the game often.

Take on mars is a great simulation game for those who want to see what it would be like to explore mars like nasa. In singleplayer you run a space program with a goal of exploring mars with rovers and landers. The single player can be boring if you are not into slow paced games. Most people won't like singleplayer unless they have  enthusiasm for space. The multiplayer is about manned missions to mars.  Once you land on mars its up to you and other to build a settlement on mars using 3d printers. Once you build a base for online it can get kinda of boring. I recommend that you set your own goals for online when playing. The goals can be anything as long as it keeps from gwtting bored. When playing online do not expect lots of action. This is a mars simulater its not meant to be action packed. Overall I would recommend this game only to people who have a love of space. This game gets an 8/10. The only things holding it back right now is a lack of content, but this should be fixed soon. Before you buy the game keep in mind you are buying a beta and not a complete game.

I would say this is not for everyone because there is no combat, weapon crafting, PVP, PVE ect. but i think this game is more of a relaxed type sim, well unless your running out of O2 and there is nothing neer you to refill haha. <-- happends to me alot. but on the plus side of that my brother plays also and he jumps in the Mobile Lab and hauls butt to me so i can get to the airlock.

Research can easily bring that down to $500 thousand. Basic probe missions net you $150 thousand, but you *need* at least $50 to start these.\n\nSpent 30 minutes surveying Mars with probes these basic probes that I cannot control, taking pictures of the land. Ran out of money conducting research, and I could not afford to fund another mission (game over).\n\nSpent the next 30 minutes restarting the game. Surveyed all of Mars and built up my funds, so I researched a controllable zero-G probe. Think of a quadcopter, for space. This was obviously more fun to survey things with, as you actually got to do something. Only problem is that if you are too sporadic with your in-flight maneuvers, then components break. Components break, you lose control of your $1 million probe (yes, these ones cost $1 million). Good news is that if you don't screw up, you net $1.5 million. Otherwise, you're pretty much screwed.\n\nI spun my zero-G probe too fast, lost control of it, and went from $1.9 million to $900 thousand. Really really frustrating spending a half hour getting to this comfortable point, just to have it all fall apart because I held the Up-Arrow too long. It was then not worth the time to try and recover the funds.\n\nI would love to continue this game, but the knowledge that the game assumes you have about playing it is too much to learn without hours worth of trial and error, which means restarting your game multiple times, which means taking at least 30 minutes to an hour or more to get back to where you were.\n\nI DO recommend this game, I just don't know enough not to continue to get frustrated by it, so beware.","February 1, 2015","true","1.7"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","1"

Back at its first release it was really nothing but send probes to MARS and try to get money to send Rovers to Mars so you could drive them around.\nNOW. You can play it out in a campaign and work your way from probes to manned missions. Or you can play in manned mode right away. The game includes an editor to create your own mission, scenario's, add-ons and play how where you want.. from Earth to the Moon, to Asterdoids to Mars to other..\nCurrently you only need to worry about providing a food source and water for your astronaut. But you will see quickly that on mars or any location with any amount of moisture in the soil or air its pretty easily done. Although they need to keep their habitat pressurized, failure to do so has no affect such as sucking you and your O2 out the hole or door.. you just choke to death.  Building is not an issue as your not required to have resources, only a 3d printer included in your mission.\nSO. Its fun, and the vehicles are really a neat thing to mess with. BUT It has a long way to go yet. I say its going to be a great simulator of space, but not yet. At this time if its on sale grab it if you like astronauts and space, it will keep you busy, but otherwise its kind of like Stranded Deep in space. Once you mess with it a bit thats it...

This is no exception.\n\nLet's start here - for what they are charging for Early Access, I was pleasantly surprised.  It feels clean, well-executed, and rather than feeling overtly incomplete, rife with "ragged edges", it's actually pretty tidy in terms of how playable it is "right now", and how features that aren't yet ready are addressed, such as the presence of the blue "Early Access" icon that you'll occasionally see as you work thru the UI.\n\nGranted - while that statement in and of itself doesn't speak to the quality of the final product, what it does speak to, for me, is that of a team that cares about the Early Access users' experience along the way; consideration of the ongoing relationship between developers and players -  equivalent of that waiter that stops by your table to acknowledge you - even if they can't take your order just in that moment.\n\nIn short - it's a nice touch that it would be addressed at all in this manner, and I hope this continues as the title matures and all features become available.\n\nOther thoughts:\n\nThis game won't be for everyone; it's methodical, a "quiet" game, a game for fans of astronomy/exploration, no doubt -and encompassing elements of building, strategy and simulation. Along the way, for those so inclined, there's plenty of science trivia.\n\nI see it as casual, but with purpose and intent, and good in that you can pick it up for hours, or minutes, with the option to "bend time" as needed if you want (or need) to move things along.\n\nI like how the UI manages to be fairly straightforward/intuitive - you can pretty much dive in and figure things out very quickly,  and yet what lies ahead clearly points to indepth gameplay/strategy; it's easy to get into it, but you immediately realise - this is not going to "stay" quite so easy as you progress through the research tree - and your available budget.\n\nSpeaking of that - the big budget your team have been granted isn't as much money as it may seem - don't spend too much, too soon.   The research-based "talent" trees cover everything from soil analysis and robotics to power management, but consider where you invest first, and how much, as you gradually build up funding for the various probes, instruments, protective elements and such that have to be added, tested, paid for, and successfully implemented - and once you do go for launch, don't assume everything will go to plan.   Fragile, precise, expensive instruments...limited budget - now let's throw in some insane Martian winds? Hey, what could go wrong?\n\n(...insert a little nod to Kerbal here).\n\nFrom the initial rough probe that bobs around helplessly on the surface like a lost bowling pin, there's a long road ahead of you to get from aforementioned bowling pin to footprints on the surface of the Red Planet.\n\nThat's the ideal formula for me, anyway - in terms of time, and in terms of learning curves - accessible, but challenging - casual, but with clear directives.\n\n\nI think it's one of the fairer-priced titles in Early Access - fair and modest for what I think is a promising title, especially when I consider what I've seen for far higher prices on Steam.\n\nI hope to loop back to this review once I've logged more hours, and I hope to add equally positive comments.","March 4, 2015","true","9.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

From all I've read I've expected somewhat a sandbox game in which I build up a base on Mars. But all I see are single missions with pre-built bases or a really slow and tedious (and buggy) career mode in which you basically only press buttons to send probes to mars, drive around for hours (literally hours) to go to point A to click a button, drive to point B, click a button.... just to find out after 45 minutes driving, that the mission is bugged and you can't take pictures of the last two objectives.\n\nWoahhh, so much frustration with this game.","May 28, 2015","false","21.0"," 37 of 60 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","37","60","0","0"

It's mostly complete with some missing features such as science results, I think the rovers still never actually run out of power and last I played it, it was still confusing as to what type of science a POI actually wants you to do. The biggest problem is the amount of time it takes for a rover to get anywhere. Obviously the rovers are slow, but there's no auto navigation and while you can trick the rover into driving forward without having to press a button constantly, you have to keep correcting as the rover will constantly veer off course.\n\nThe second part of the game, where the focus seems to have shifted entirely is the manned section, which is very interesting in theory, but falls short in terms of actual gameplay. Everything you do as a Mars colonist is very buggy and clunky with physics going haywire at the slightest provocation. For example, I managed to take out a bulkhead out of the large vehicle when trying to open a door, decompressing myself in the process. This is in part due to the UI being tied to game objects, which require precise clicking and even though you can change from interaction with the center of screen dot and cursor you can move independantly of the view, the UI is inconsistent about which input it will accept.\n\nAnother issue I have with object interaction is handling basically anything - you pick up an object and when it's in your hands, you can control how far from your body you hold it by scrolling the mouse wheel, the rotate it with one key and rotate it in a different way by pressing a modifier button in addition to the rotation button. Most objects won't connect with another object unless they're position in a particular way and when you add the weird handling of objects, pile it on top of the physics you will probably watch the resource container you've been fiddling with fly off into the distant martian landscape.\n\nContent is being added but I'm not even interested in trying it out any more because the underlying issues persist and it seems backwards to add interesting things without having a stable framework that would allow you to have fun with all the elements present. The game is supposed to be nearing the end of its development cycle and I don't see it changing much in ways that would make it fun to actually play.\n\nIn short the game has many interesting elements that are combined with clunky, buggy gameplay, making a potentially fun and interesting experience dull and annoying.","October 11, 2015","false","18.3"," 25 of 38 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","25","38","0","0"

This sim is so realistic in every way, from the rad counts and how solar flaires happen, all the way to airlock seals and intricate grid systems, i mean, even the solar panels get more dusty in storms.. This doesn't seem sci-fi at all, but more sim realistic..\n\nthe single player campain has a full training system, vehicles, and what not to teach you about the controls of all the diffrent vehicles and what have you. The construction lab where you build your own rover, the tech tree of diffrent teirs to unlock depending on how much funding you got with successful missions, and even the wiki information thats ACCURATE on current findings as you explore the missions.watching the sky crane or landing sequences, or even the total destruction or even partial one that can happen if you really mess something up..You can sample the dirt, drill, take atmospheric readings, its just nothing short of content rich filled exploration.. thats just chapter one...\n\nThe multiplayer works as well, and building with friends? theirs nothing like it. They GIVE YOU the engine tools to build models or import them from other graphic programs, the workshop community is vast, and even the scenarios, the scenarios are fun, never the same no matter how you play.\n\nthose pictures posted?

Take On Mars is a (fun) space survival sim that was made by the makers of the Arma series. And I have to say that it's a pretty good game so far. I haven't tried a couple scenarios, I haven't tried the Robotics campaign fully, nor have I even been able to get the time to try out multiplayer. But from what I have done (messing around on Mars Island in a helicopter, floating around in space in orbit around a planet, getting ejected into space via jetpack, etc.) can give me a basic idea that the game is pretty good. It could do with more content with items you can build or do, like more things to do in the vast area of space. With the build system, it can get frustrating when working alone, but become a lot easier with friends.\n\nHonestly.... it's just space, what the heck do you think it would be? Boring? Ok well.... sometimes. Smash some bots in the campaign, fly a heli at Mars Island and crash it like an action movie would. Have fun for Christ's sake! It ain't all about Mars now ain't it?

Airlocks are intended to permit passage between exterior and interior spaces without depressurizing the interior, as opposed to depressurizing everything BUT the space between the two airlock doors.  And regular interior doors have a chance of depressurizng everything as well, even if the pressure on either side is safe.\n\n-Damage to space suits is global, rather than on a per-instance basis.  In other words, if you damage the legs on your medium suit, then take it off and put on a completely unused heavy suit, the legs of the heavy suit are also damaged.\n\n-It's insanely easy to get stuck in geometry.  Attempting to get unstuck is also risky, as the physics engine loves throwing players around at high velocities.\n\n-Things that look like they should fit together don't.  For example, the corners of airlock corridors have the same radius as regular curved walls, but refuse to be attached to anything but airlock passageways.\n\n-The editor is both difficult to use and completely undocumented.  There's no indication that snapping is even a thing in the editor, making it impossible to construct a base outside of the scenario itself.\n\n-Mouse acceleration is ridiculous and impossible to disable, meaning that a movement of the mouse as small as a few centimeters can sometimes rotate the camera completely around three or four times.  (Keep in mind I'm not talking about mouse lag, which is thankfully nonexistent, mouse speed, which can be changed using the incorrectly-named "mouse resolution" setting, or the "fluid camera" setting, which can be disabled.)\n\nI do understand that this is a beta, and thus a number of the things I mentioned will probably be addressed before the game is officially released, but for now I have to give it a thumbs-down.","July 13, 2015","false","87.5"," 38 of 65 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","38","65","3","0"

The first and most important for me is that it takes place on a planet that I had an obsession from my early days (Yeah just like Douglas Quaid! )\nAlthough I was never a fan of simulation games, there is something in this title that makes me getting back at several times of the day. As I'm playing more and more I actually can't really consider it a simulation, but a slow paced adventure-driving game. In my head simulations are crazy difficult and too much complicated. Here things are simple - Press up and there you go - but it also has the depth with additions like upgrades and some kind of fun missions like photographing specific locations or even scooping and drilling.\nThe mood and graphics are more than excellent and generally almost every aspect of the game it seems that has been worked with much love (+1).\nTo be honest sometimes I wished It had some little surprises - just a tiny evidence of alien life (just a scrap) or maybe some caves (!) but I guess that's what mods are for..\nI'm really happy that this game exists and it is a great companion when I'm not in the mood for fast action stuff.\n\n\n","May 22, 2015","true","37.5"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

I've followed this game for a while and since the beginning of 2015, it has had a few critical updates improving and editing the gameplay experiance. Also it feels alot like The Martian :D.\nWhen playing this, you must bare in mind that it is early access - so do expect bugs and glitches thoughout. Here are the pros and cons (in my opinion) for the current state of the game.\n\nPros:\n- Beatuiful scenery and fantastic, realistic gameplay.\n- Various scenarios and features to play with.\n- Very easy to create addons to upload to the steam workshop.\n- Updates and roadmaps to continuously improve the game.\n- Fun multiplayer which can provide hours of entertainment.\n- Simplistic HUD for anyone to understand.\n- There are so many destinations from: test environments on Earth, several craters on Mars, The Moon, Mars' moon Deimos, the Astroid Belt and low orbit space stations around Earth and Mars.\n\nCons:\n- Bugs and glitches which can affect your gameplay experiance.\n- Lot's of features which you wish were implemented but aren't.\n- Limited gameplay in the Space Program mode.\n- Building can be complicated, confusing and frustrating.\n- There are no tutorials for manned missions.\n- The price seems a little high for this kind of game.\n\nThe pros outweigh the cons in my opinion and I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is intrested in space games, simulation games or sandbox games.","October 16, 2015","true","24.2"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

The single player is intensly boring and slow. It's very technical, which the development team is fantastic at, but there is no playable worth to the game. The only exception would be someone who is considered a tried-n-true enthusiast of robotics and/or uneventful planetary exploration.\n\nMessage to Bohemia: I've been playing your games for years. As a company who chooses to focus on a very specific niche gamer, consider me to be as big of a supporter as anyone else you could meet. Thousands of hours devoted to your titles, so I don't say this lightly. You have two core game styles that emerge from Multiplayer, which is what honestly drives the popularity of your titles, not the campaign. Your fantastic military gameplay style, which would only need to be polished more responsive for future titles, whether it be ArmA or not, it's very very good being as intricate as it is. The other, Role Play servers. You inadvertantly created something that allowed the players to create the most perfect role play game on this planet. The only issue is that those people are inefficient, lacking development knowledge and core access. You have such a monumental level of potential with what's been made. If you were to make a non-military related civilian role play game, albeit equally weaponized with practical firearms, you would create a polished and perfected base for a very intricate and realistic roleplay experience. Just with ArmA 3 RP Life servers now, you are given the ability to do things that no other game allows you to live out. You need only spend a month in a Life server to see that the game is used in a manner that would overwhelm the gaming world if done in a fully developed way. With the advancements in VR, a Bohemia Realism Role Play game with a VR headset would be unstoppable.\n\nFood for thought.\n\nI apologize for the negative review, it is purely based on the playability of this game, for me.","May 3","false","0.2"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","1"

Intellectual dishonesty is despicable, as is insulting the obvious hard work behind this project. And no, I-m not paid by anyone.\n\nThe scientifc depth, the attention to realism, the gameplay, the graphics, everything testifies of the skills of the developing team, and their commitment to an ambitious and fascinating project. Kudos to them, also for their responsiveness to the community.\n\nI am about to finish the space program, therefore haven't nearly explored the whole scope of the game, not even tried the manned or survival part of it. But I can already confidently say that even only with what I have seen now, this is well worth the money. The BETA is stable. And it has the potential to be, simply, a masterpiece. If a number of recommendations and ideas as presented by the community will be integrated in the final development the game, it can IMHO attain a level of unprecedented excellence.\n\nOf course, this is not for adrenaline junkies. I process my mails, watch the news, and even manage some substantive discussion with my wife, while playing this (...).\n\nBut if you are into realistic space exploration, astrophysics, astronautics, (space) engineering, then do yourself a favor and support this project. Devs, don't give up. I know people want space zombies and stuff, but I-m not the only one enjoying and appreciating the scientific (and fun) dimension of your project.\n\nBuilding my first large rover, landing it, navigating it through Martian terrain, and proceeding with a successful series of scientific tasks... that was freaking good.\n\nThe Zero-gravity probe is great fun too. Here too, the experience is very immersive, the wannabe astronaut in me has a hard-on when navigating the asteroid belt and getting, after a careful approach (prepare to see your vehicle shattered by debris, or crashed by your recklessness), to scoop dirt and more, while zooming out in the big black space.\n\nHighly, highly recommended.\n\nCurrent games: Silent Hunter 5 (heavily modded...), Verdun, and now ... Take on Mars.","August 21, 2015","true","146.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Currently, the singleplayer guidence is severly lacking. It teaches you about the different rooms within the faciliy, goes over the map, and finally gives you the option of using game time or real time. Thats it. I didn't get too far into the singleplayer experience but I would assume that theres no lessons on what to do once you land someone on the surface.\n\n(I do get that this is still being made)\n\nMultiplayer and scenarios (?) are super fun when they go well, but terrible when they dont. Singleplayer scenarios never crash (unlike their multiplayer counterparts) but lack the entertainment that another person brings. Multiplayer crashes often but can be so so so much fun. The physics engine seems a little wonk, so exploiting it in the mobile lab or on top of the flying lander is just plain goofy. Base building may need an update, right now you have to put every single panel in place by your self.

Initially, the development team seems to have been taking their sweet time doing tiny updates to this title. After a year or so wasted, the development did pick up. However, lately, it's back into constant-postpone mode. The release date is actually no longer even specified and just says "at some point in 2015", even though not that long ago it was set to "june 2015".\nThe game itself is quite fun and relaxing, you explore the surface of Mars, using vaguely realistic and progresively more modern technology. Over the course of development, other bodies were added and a manned program is now also available as a "cherry on top".\nHowever, bugs are a plenty, and the neverending development hell is what makes this not recomended to anyone, but the biggest fan.

Over time I have gotten to see this game grow more and more, thus expanding it's own potential. Take On Mars not only is a simulator, but an educational platform (Hence the wiki data you unlock in the Robotics portion.). With games like this, and Kerbal Space Program, I see a lot of potential for games to bring new challenges and focus to many forms of education in simulation that can even be utilized in classrooms to get kids interested in space exploration, physics, astrobiology, and aeronautics through adaptive and hands on learning.\n\nI know it's been a long time, and yes the due date has been pushed back, and yes there are still bugs that need to be smashed. But in the end, Take On Mars will be a perfect platform for both simulation lovers, and Mars Enthusiasts as the work put into this makes it one of the most unique games currently in beta. Long strides have been made in gaming technology that opens up more intuitive and complex forms of learning and adapting to in game demands through user comprehension and skill. This game needs as much notice and support as possible.\n\n------------------------------------------------Section Two--------------------------------------\n\nTake On Mars is a game based on the research of Mars in understanding what is to be expected for human crews to work with. In the first portion you are able to utilize probes, lander, rovers, and advanced equipment to study the martian surface and gather real world intel based on scientific findings. In chapter two you will take the role of a surviving astronaut who has to survive on the surface through building and maintaining equipment (Chapter2 is still in development.)\n\nAlso there are singleplayer and multiplayer scenarios, along with an editor so that you can build your own scenario and upload it to the workshop. Along with this is the ability to easily mod the game files via the developer toolset if you're into that. This gives grounds so a lot of malleability to the game and what players can do with it. Overall, despite it being unfinished I have to give it a 8/10 for both the improvements, the dev team, and the uniqueness of the game. There are others sure, like Mars: Challenger, which is fun but not one I can honestly recommend.\n\nAll in all, Take On Mars is a gem, and to those wondering if it is worth buying I will say this:\n\nIf you don't mind putting in the effort to submit bug reports, push the game mechanics, and test different aspects of the game then yes, buy it and help the developers expand and debug more of it.\n\nIf you want something polished off the bat and are not patient or willing to aid in development, then no, and nor should you buy any game on Early Access because that is what it is for.","March 22","true","251.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Now I'm wondering if I could manually navigate a small lander to land atop a large rover, having a criminal amount of fun, and I haven't even touched the new colonization and zero-g probe features yet.\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, but I give it a hearty recommend to anyone interested in space exploration.","August 31, 2014","true","22.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Sometimes it's a game released as a tech demo and then the devs vanish with your cash. Other times they release a couple of tiny updates that do nothing much, then call the game finished.\nThese guys have been incredible, with a huge amount of updates, constant feedback on the forums, both here and the bohemia forums.\nI have even had them add me as a friend, ask for my input personally, and seen my suggestions added within a day.\nI have had them reply to a problem I was having, email my save file to one of them (Dram, he is just the best, seriously, great developer for early access, he is into helping the community all the time), and had a patch released that fixes a problem that only I was having. He did that within 2 hours of me posting the topic on the steam forum.\nAs for the game. If you have any interest in this kind of thing, then this is for you. It does exactly what you would expect, and it does it in such a way as to make you feel like you work for NASA, without having to learn all about rocket science and such to do so.\nThis alongside kerbal space program show exactly how this kind of game is great for early access, when they have the right developer.\nI can't fault this game at all.\nThe only thing is that I am itching for release now, to see how the finished product turns out. But with all the new things they keep announcing, it looks likely to be in early access for a while.\nBut seeing as the early access experience here has been almost as enjoyable as the game itself, I don't see that as a terrible thing. I have been made to feel important, an integral part of the evolution of the game, right from the start.

I'm a fan of the science-fiction genre. Put those two together and you get Take on Mars.\n\nWhile not completely finished, as denotes it's Beta Build, it is on it's way to becoming a remarkably accurate simulator (with obvious gameplay exceptions) of survival on Mars.\n\nThat being said... it does suffer similar problems to most Open World Sandbox games of the same ilk at the moment. Notably the 'nothing to do but survive' problem. At least in most scenarios. Take On Mars, however, seems to address this problem with the Scenario / Scenario Editor... you can utilise triggers, events, etc. to create a story arc style of play. From landing, base building, to extraction should you want it, and thus solve the major issues of the survive to survive most survival genre titles have.\n\nWhat strikes me most about this game in either the Single or Multiplayer, is the emptiness. Some put it down as a Con, I put it down as a Pro... Mars is empty. There is very little to do there in reality, and this is refelcted somewhat by gameplay. However, the inclusion of science experiments, sampling, and more would add greatly to the overall experience.\n\nYou can 'fake' science with the previously mentioned Scenario Triggers, but this pales in comparison to what the developers could possibly do in terms of story arc.\n\nSingle Player - The Single Player Gameplay starts with what could be considered a 'modern space age' where you send probes, landers and rovers to Mars, Deimos, and even the Asteroid Belt. After 'completing' this portion of the campaign gathering all the outlined data under objectives, you are ready to launch your manned mission.\n\nI don't want to spoil the storyline of this mission arc, but Mark Watney move over, there's a new King of Mars. And it is story driven, though limited in scope. Starting in one area, and moving to another. With no option to alter which starting area, nor where you head to.\n\nIf you're looking for a completely free-roam Open World Sandbox game, this one is not for you. If you're looking for a game that throws enough realism in your face to be accounted a 'true' survival game then this is the one for you.\n\nThe team seems dedicated to keeping updates flowing, and they do address problems with the product as they can.\n\nThe game has been in Early Access for a while, but this doesn't phase me in the slightest. Years in development is basically any title that has something unique about it, or needs to be built in a different way from previous titles. Comparing development times of a game like this to games such as Battlefield or Call of Duty wastes time, and mental energy. Building onto previously formulae (Battlefield, Call of Duty, <insert other franchise here>) will always be faster, easier, and more efficient than creating something new, and I prefer the effectiveness of Take On Mars to the fast development that would see it be a reskin of another title.\n\nIn conclusion, the game does have bugs, and some of its elements lack polish, but if the development team continues the way they are going it may well show a new way to experience survival that actually throws whatever it can at you to make you fail, without big green aliens, zombies, or other post apocalyptic horrors.","October 11, 2015","true","112.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

There are a ton of bugs and the game doesn't seem to run smoothly at all. Everything is tedious to do, even exiting the initial lander vehicle is difficult and you will most likely get stuck in the elevator or float in the air the first 3 or 4 times you try to leave.\n\nThis game has a lot of potential, but it seems to be very far from fulfilling that potential.

You do some science stuff in the space program, building custom landers and rovers and researching new technologies to unlock new parts for your vehicles. There are plenty of locations available that are fairly big, so you won't run out of Mars surface to drive on anytime soon. There are also several scenarios in the game, some which enable you to play as an astronaut on Mars (and even on the Moon and in orbit!) and built bases and drive around in big cool rovers.\n\nI only played 6 hours as of this review, but I can already see that there's plenty more fun to be had here! So if you like things that have something to with space exploration, this is a must have game for you, in my opinion. Also, if you read The Martian by Andy Weir and liked it, you'll probably love this game too.","July 13, 2015","true","21.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And just think of the mod's that will come with it, And for the people out their getting upset because the game has been on early access for 3 year's, i have not seen a company make a game that could keep me interested if it was done in a year or so, i mean i hardly will touch call of duty, and i loved black ops and Call of duty mw, but they suck and well, Arma 3 was the only shooting game i needed, but 10/10 but if they could fix multiplayer i would like too launch my friend into space >:D","May 4","true","19.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","2"

Take On Mars is one of them.\n\nRarely have I seen a game that is quite well polished (has bugs don't get me wrong but it is still early access). It's got a lot of features incl. Multiplayer.  It is packed with features from Mars exploration with probes and custom built rovers... to actual colonisation of the red planet with extensive building options. Survival is a key element of this game with thirst, hunger and general health hindering every move you make. Lot's of vehicles from exploration rovers to forklifters and mobile labs will guarantee hours of fun with friends.\n\nIf a game keeps me going for more than 24 hours, then I know there is something special about it.

Things like taking soil samples, pictures, and just generally exploring the area.

Well with the scenario editing tools you can put yourself in Mark Watney's suit. That concept got me to buy the game early access 12/26/15.  I played with the existing campaigns, both the robotics and manned and then jumped into the scenario editor.\n\nRobtics Campaign- Meh.. it will appeal to some and not to others.  Give it a shot and see if it is for you.  I do see the potential to use it to encourage kids as a learning game as well as the pure 'game' aspects.  Cool.  Not my cuppa but cool.  They are still working on it and it may become 'more' and I will poke my head back in later.\n\nManned Campaign- You start out as a lone survivor after a crash. Not much here at the moment and it ends after about 10 min, but it lets you see some of what is coming.\n\nScenario Editor- OMG.  This alone was worth the money for the game as it is now IMHO.  It is finiky. The controls are so sensative you may want to scream, it can and will crash your whole system (early access folks!), still fun.  It took very little time to put some cargo pods on the surface, put some goodies in them and make a lander at altitude with a screaming me inside.  A little brousing and soon I had triggers etc figured out.  Other players are posting some great scenarios so you can dive in and play without doing it yourself.\n\nI can not wait until the game gets to the point you can start in orbit and transfer to a lander, pick a spot and drop. =)\nMulti player looks promising if you like co-op building.\n\nIssues?  Uh yeah.  Early access.  Not going to beat the devs up or bash the game.  I'll wait, and if they don't update etc I will edit to reflect (and bash them and the game).  Past exp with this publisher makes me think it won't be an issue.\n\nI have had many issues with crashing but.. early access.\nTextures and shaders will flub up and it needs a system reboot to correct.\nRunning memory monitoring software and even sitting doing nothing the game slowly eats more and more memory untill crash.. but *shrug* early access.\n\nOverall I will say worth what I paid (on sale), and if you are a space geek and don't mind the issues with an early access title go ahead and get it now.

Dram and BI are doing an excellent job crushing bugs and getting some amazing open-world feeling with tons of technically corrrect modules and research and exploration options.  I can't wait to plan a mission from Earth to Mars, and then launch from mars to some other destination.  Really amazing graphics and I love the terrain 9x9km blocks taken from HiRISE data.  Despite some crashes initially, it seems to run well enough now, and the homicidal elevator (elevator?!?) in the massive 4 story capsule being the only thing relegating the game to science fiction status.  The flying vehicle and helo need to be mods since there's no way those would ever be on the surface.

However, if you're an avid fan of the exploration front of our lives, this might be for you. The pictures and previews of the game aren't excatly accurate, BUT one day will be. And when it is, oh ho ho, man it will be amazing.\n\nPersonally, I think this game is amazing. Even in early access there is so much to do and so much excitement to be had in doing it. That being said though, I know there will be alot of people who disagree and straight hate this game. It's easy to understand why though. This game is for those who want to take their time and don't mind taking literally hours to do one little thing.\n\nNow onto the bugs. Of course there are bugs, glitches and pieces of incomplete game, it's Early Access! what do you expect? There was a glitch I came across where (Because I was finishing up for the night and only just started on the scenario) I took off my spacesuit and exposed myself to the vaccume of space on the moon. While I was expecting a rather quick death, there was a noticable delay in the decompression of the small rover airlock (about 5 seconds). During the breath phase I closed the airlock but died. Oh well. They've offered a respawn button for now but I repawned half in the cabin, half in space and almost died again.\n\nDuring the first scenario on Mars, I noticed there was a hole in the mountain. Now not the regular kind of hole but the one that let's you crouch under and walk inside the mountain. Simple incomplete texture.\n\nWhile roving on Mars, It took multipul attempts to scan one area while clearly inside the atmospheric scan zone using the correct instuments.\n\nThere are also many parts of the training yet to be finished (which again, Early Access, it was expected).\n\nAll in all, This game has one hell of a lot of promise and potential, which I am excited to see released. there will be patches along the way and many MANY additions but I look forward to every single one of them. Sure it's rough around the edges, and I probably sound extremely forgiving for this game, but it's because I can see it will be amazing and fun.\n\nSmall area to target but you hit the nail on the head!

Or rather the promise of what the game can be... I bought this game in December 2015 with promises of a 1.0 non-beta version coming out in Feb 2016. Dissapointment after dissapointment has all I have recieved. Constant updates and little as far as information as to what had been worked on is available unless you spend an hour looking through the forums. Forums are great but when you are pushing a new update would it kill to put some info in the news stream? The last headline was from an article that originally led me to the game in the first place and its not much of a help as to the game play. There are tons of "coming soon" points in the in game gui that make using vehicles and such a pain in the bottom. PLEASE tell me whats going on and why I paid a big game dev company money for a product they dont seem to care about finishing.

The game is very realistic and beautifully presented. However just like Gran Turismo it does get a little repetitive after a while.\nThe game is very well made. It is highly informative and gives you a good sense of experience in controlling a unmanned mission to Mars.\nWhen I played it for the first time I found it difficult to understand. But after couple of hours of clicking to find the right screens I began to understand the idea of the game. This does make the main game difficult to play. There is a tutorial which you will need to read. Also researching technology in the game is not clear and difficult to understand. I hope in time that they will fix this. In the mean time you will need to explore the game itself as well as the planet Mars to understand how it works. If you do lose patients with the main game there are many single missions which will keep you occupied. They are all great fun and very informative. If you enjoy exploring then this is the game for you. You will visit actual locations on Mars, using actual scientific equipment to unlock the knowledge and mysteries of the big red planet.\nDepending on your graphics card the detail is amazing. When exploring Mars you do feel very alone on this vast world. The highly detailed graphics and sound effects create a atmosphere which leaves you very isolated in the game.\nThe controls are awkward but I believe that was on purpose to add to the realism of controlling a remote control vehicle across space.\n\nI do recommend this game but you will need to be a little patient at times on how to play it. The game is still in it early stages and the potential for this game is vast. I am personally hoping they add sci-fi missions like a manned mission to Mars or first contact with martians. At time of this review being submitted the developers are currently very active in listening to the players and improving the game.","January 3, 2014","true","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For as long as I can remember I have had a fascination with earths red neighbour. Since a child I have watched and read all about the various probes and landers sent to Mars.  Heard all the stories, myths and theories surrounding that place. It won't be long now when we will see a real possibility of a human stepping onto mars for the first time even if it will be a one way trip.  Take on Mars has really surprised me. I was expecting some kind of open world Mars exploration game but oh it is so much, much more than that. So far I haven't even set foot on the place. I am playing the campaign which means I start my journey right at the beginning with simple probes and black / white pictures.\nIn this mode you literally live through the history of exploration on Mars. Each successful mission earns you money which you can then plough into research to create more advanced exploration vehicles. As you advance it opens up ever more complex missions for your landers to complete. The lander camera view and the rugged Martian landscape really make you feel like you are in mission control.  There are a ton of other things you can do in Take on Mars including scenarios and multiplayer. For less than £10 this early release is a real diamond in the rough. Its fairly stable and very playable. The sounds and visuals that accompany you on your adventure add to the atmosphere.\n\nTake on Mars is not going to be for everybody. Its certainly not fast paced and the only action will come in the form of technical disasters or your astronaut suit running out of oxygen. For me though it gives me a chance to do something I will never experience. Its a wonderful journey about what has been, what is now and what is coming in the near future.\n\nI hope the developers keep putting their love into this title because if they do it will be a superb finished product.","May 10, 2015","true","10.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's still in beta, people.  Does it crash?  Yes, but you can STILL progress and have a meaningful experience if you're patient and save often.  I can't speak for multiplayer at this point, but in the last week I've built a fully functional base by myself (I'm a fan of the manned missions) and was into full-fledged methane production (a very time-consuming compound to make in the game).\n\nIt's worth your time if you're a space/science buff and are looking for an immersive space exploration experience.  With the way that development is going now, it seems like when the kinks are worked out of this game it could be a real-life simulation of survival on the red planet...if NASA ever develops space suits that can be put on/removed by one person. That's how immersive it is.\n\nIt doesn't just stop at Mars, either.  You can send rovers or conduct manned missions to asteroids, the moon of earth and the moons of Mars (Phobos and Deimos).  The devs have thought of everything and the attention to detail is fantastic.  I'm eager to see what will come in future updates and the anticipated v. 1.0 release.\n\nI highly recommend this game as long as the devs keep up the good work.","May 20","true","76.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrChips/recommended/244030/","MrChips","MrChips","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrChips/","206 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe latest update has completely and utterly broken this game, and the developer seems to be more interested in adding stuff instead of getting what already exists to work properly.  Previous versions worked (rather well, I might add).  Here's the rundown of what's going wrong:\n\nFirst of all, the career mode is an exercise in tedium and in no way reflects how the exploration of Mars actually played out.  Technologies are far too expensive, requiring players to repeat the same mission type (probe exploration; basically dropping a camera-equipped dumbell onto the surface) to get your first meagre stream of "revenue".  While you start with a fair bit of cash, you burn through it quickly researching the technologies needed to build your first small lander.  The only problem with your first lander is that many of the "major goals" involve taking photographs in multiple directions; something your small lander is categorically incapable of doing, even if you research the technologies needed for the camera mast (the component needed to take panoramic shots).\n\nSecondly, the method of controlling various instruments, and in fact the whole keymap for TKOM, appears to be based in fallacy; nothing works at all!  I can't get robotic arms to do anything, and I am unable to switch what the primary and secondary controls actually control anything other than the retro thrusters.  Trying to edit the keymap just ends in frustration too - it won't let you add controls that are assigned to other functions, even if those other functions are not active or even possible.  You can't, for example, delete the thruster controls in Lander mode and re-map them to the same key because the game warns you that the control is shared with the movement keys for Human mode - YES I KNOW THEY'RE THE SAME CONTROL BUT THERE ISN'T A HUMAN ANYWHERE NEAR MARS, AND AT THE RATE WE'RE GOING, THERE WON'T EVER BE ONE EITHER!  And don't even get me started on joystick support - if you have anything except for an XBox controller, you're totally and utterly boned, because you can't remap the axes and you can't set deadzones either.  Normally, I wouldn't be too irritated by this, but the developer, Dram (yes, I'm calling you out by name), has been posting all over the Steam support forum for this game, promising proper joystick support for the better part of 18 months now, and we've got nothing to show for it.\n\nThere are other little irritations too; automatic flight mode is janky as all hell; landers swoop down low, then skim the surface in a rather uneconomical way, then when they approach their destination they scream up to a few dozen meters, then slowly return to land.  That is, if they don't get caught in an endless hover loop twenty meters from the target.  So you click off automatic mode and try to land the thing manually - good luck with THAT.  A lack of actual tutorials is an impediment to the game as well - all you get are a series of unhelpful videos.\n\nIn short, if you want go go explore Mars and don't have the money (or lack of sense) to buy a seat on Mars One, go buy Kerbal Space Program.","September 8, 2014","false","14.4"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","16","31","2","0"

There is no game alike that can possibly compete. There was an update a few days ago. There are still very many bugs and things that need to be worked out. Such as the basic probes launched in the first chapter, the cameras need to be fixed. The last 3 training mission need voice audio because the subtitle dimish too quickly foir anyone to read. It has so much potential and is very advanced for it's state of development. Although, I am concerned for the fact it was released in 2013 and is still in it's beta mode. It has so much potential and needs to be finished, they should dedicate more money and time into completing this product. it would bring them a huge revenue, but also give gamers, and people fascinated with space exploration, an opportunity to enter the field and understand the reality of space and another planet. What adds to the excitement is that NASA will be sending humans to Mars in 2018. This is an excellent game with so much to do and I stand to support it. Do not judge it too quickly, buy it and play it.","May 15","true","43.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A barren Planet with red sand and rocks. Sounds boring. But this fellow manages to get us wondering about life there and we want to know more about it's past and if intelligent life might have existed or even still exists on Mars. This game feeds your curiosity and let's you explore well known places of the planet like Victoria or Kaiser Crater. The simulation is of course not 100% realistic - otherwise you would need to wait 20 minutes after each command. But the graphics are awesome and you face the dangers and beauty of Mars. And it has mods. If you like KSP, you might like this one too. The developers are very dedicated and the game gets updates very often. Oh and it has a real time mode.

I only hope that my review helps you to make the right decision.\n\nWell, to start with, the game will be loved by every fan of space exploration games. In this game you take the role of Mars colonization program and you basically do the following:\n1.Choose how to spend the money you have by funding your scientist to find new technologies that are used to upgrade your equipment and by doing so, you slowly reach the point of being able to send humans on the red planet.\n2.You control your landers, rovers, spacecrafts and later even humans. This is more or less what you do. Controlling machines so as to finish tasks and later humans in order to survive and explore Mars\n\nNow about what it feels playing the game. If you seek action and adventure leave. If you seek to reach your adrenaline levels to the top leave. You won't like this game. But if you seek a calm lonely drive ithrough the Martians plains, then you are in the right place. If you don't like long rides from on side of a crater to the other just to collect and analyse some sand, this game is not for you.\nI don't want to waste any more of your time so I will sum up. This is a game about space exploration fans, that would like to see how it is to explore for many hours Mars, and help mankind to achieve its next big step, colonising for the first time a planet. I don't want to spoil you any more of its content, so I will stop here.\n\nI'm sorry for any mistakes I made, I am not a native speaker but I tried my best. If you think that my review is incomplete or false you are free to correct me down in the comments, and I would be really happy to correct any possible mistakes I have made.\n\n\nI will tell you one more thing:\nIf this game was a woman I would marry her. And instead of a dog we would have a rover pet. On Mars.","August 18, 2015","true","33.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

But this game is a Bohemia Interactive title. B.I. tends to squeeze out a bunch of half-♥♥♥♥♥ attemps at money grabs. Basically all they do is take their Arma engine throw a few skins on it and bang, a whole new sellable piece of garbage they can drop in at early access. I got this game reguardless of the negative reviews hoping to find some solace in multiplayer. Outcome? crash bug and glitch paradise. B.I. has successfully developed a global lucritive money grab system on bringing you a game that will run for 30 minutes tops IF YOURE CAREFUL. I wouldnt wish a Bohemia Interactive title on even my enemies!, Arma 2+3 was badass, why oh why are they spanking it on developing these games? I feel bad for the actual people that developed it that do care about whats happening with their projects. The entire company as a whole needs a restructure to weave out whats causing this. They could be making so much more money if they would simply do the work we've paid them to do. Long story short dont buy in till B.I. changes their strategy or hires more devs. At this pace i'll have grandchildren before this game sees a fully playable and enjoyable release. Once B.I. becomes more involved in this lost project I will gradually change my review, maybe even a thumbs up if we can see some material here. Im so glad I bought in while it was on sale. (i bought 2 copies for myself and a friend) I would've felt alot more like I was robbed.","May 15","false","5.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I know its early access, but I'll change this review as soon as it advances enough for me to recommend it.\n\nIt's clunky, and its boring. I love realistic space games (KSP, Orbiter) and I understand slow-paced methodical gameplay, but this is different - its boredom without any real satisfaction or feeling of reward. The system for managing resources is INCREDIBLY tedious, and topped off with controls that can best be described as "butterfingers". Also the design for the lander and some of the vehicles are very unergonomic and kill the 'realistic mars mission' vibe for me. However, the design of the 'truck' rover and the scout rover are excellent. The 'campaign' if you will is more polished, but the waypoint system is very confusing and it is still for the most part unrewarding and just not fun. The game is very atmoshperic though - especially the dust storms. The camera effects are a nice touch, it feels very real and is remarkably well done.\n\nSo overall, a lot of potential, but don't buy it yet. Its too clunky and boring, but hopefully that will change before its final release.","March 24, 2015","false","24.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Would be great fun if the vehicles were faster. Drifting on Mars anyone?\n- Crafting needs instructions.\n- Lack of "enemies" or NPCs make you feel like "what do I do now? what's the point?" after you build your base.\n","January 4","false","1.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The career mode has lots of missions, but so many of them are recycled. I would recommend the game if there would actually be a point in building.\n\nPROS:\n- Good potential\n- Physics worked much better than expected\n- It is fun, for a limited time.\n\nCONS:\n- Structure building is a pain. Even after getting used to the awkward rotation, constantly running back and forth from the "3D Printer" to the place where the part had to be was annoying. The parts are also very VERY specific in how they have to be placed together.\n\n- Carrer mode is a horrible grind, so many of the missions are recyled, and many of them simply involve watching a static drone. And by that, I mean literally watching the drone's camera feed as it crashes to Mars. Mission complete. Now do that 15 times.\n\n- Many of the Scenarios are fun, and have interesting objectives. The issue is that there is no reward of any kind for completion, nothing at all. It just feels pointless.\n\n- For trying to be serious about Mars exploration, some of the features are ridiculous (weird vehicles). The game goes from trying to be really serious about realism, to being more fantasy.\n\n- There's just no point yet. I understand that it's early access, but there is no goal of the game.","June 15, 2015","false","5.8"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","0"

I haven't touched multiplayer and I probably won't either. The trailer looks really cool and it was that, that drew me to the game. Unfortunately after 24 hours of play I have yet to walk on mars. I am sat behind a desk sending probes, landers and rovers on missions. I'm going to be honest it's becoming dull. I thought the rover would add a little something extra, it does boredom. It moves so slow and you tend to have to travel hundreds of meters to your first point. Why? I don't know. the landing process is fairly surgical, so if it knows where I need to be stop putting the cross hundreds of meters away or put the missions on the landing map so I can choose where to land. i'm presuming more is yet to come but I repeat I have been playing this game for 24 hours.\n\nPlease don't get me wrong. This game/simulator is very detailed and I appreciate the content. Unfortunately it's also becoming really boring. The best way I can sum up my thoughts on "Take on Mars" is... there's a note to say saved games may not be compatible with future updates. If I started it up and my saved game was incompatible. I would delete it and never play it again. I'm currently persevering through to hopefully get to the parts of the trailer that looked fun. If I had to play through 24 hours of mind numbing trundling across Mars. I would have to delete it.","May 17, 2015","false","25.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Building in this game is slow and I dont mean minivan slow we are talking rascle scooter up hill with a 500 pound person slow. you want to build a base, cool, go ahead, but it will take you years, you build it 1 block at a time and you can create 1 block at a time on your 3D printer, yes you can make several 3D printers to speed things up, but each makes 1 block at a time and it takes from 30 seconds to 5 minutes each create the blocks. Now lets say the base you want to make has a simple 1000 blocks, after some math you will realize you are better off building your own mars mission in your back yard with sticks. Once you have the block you want then the "fun" part of trying to get it to line up where you want it, this usually intails draging it across another block to get it to turn then back because it turned to far, there is no simple rotation control that I have found like in  other creative games.\nGreat concept and it can be a great game if the bugs get worked out.","October 16, 2015","false","10.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","1"

The unmanned portion seems mostly complete, but the manned portion needs at least another year. It's full of bugs and glitches, there is absolutely no tutorial, explanation, or guide anywhere, and it's lacking a lot of immersion. The bugs range from being unable to attach a power cable properly to being flung across the Martian desert because you stood on said cable the wrong way. With no explanation in-game, on the walkthroughs through Steam, or on any forum for the game, every feature is hidden until you stumble across it and major components of the game are difficult to work out. It took me three hours to figure out how to assemble a structure, and I still have no clue what any of the various utilities do. The immersion problem is one they definitely won't fix, though, because they seem pretty happy with what they have: you can hear your astronaut's breath and heartbeat. All the time. Very loudly. Right in your ear. He also can't move any faster than a slow stroll, even on Earth, and can only run ten or twenty meters before getting winded. On the Moon, you would expect to do some cool Moon-style walking like in the NASA videos, but he just casually strolls from one place to another. I got to night-time on Mars (difficult because it's 1:1 timescale and there's no way to advance time, like sleeping or waiting) and expected some sort of awe inspiring view, but it was totally unimpressive. I was more impressed the first time I got a craft into orbit in Kerbal Space Program. I have the graphics all maxed out on a mobile GPU and I get 60 FPS - that means you're not trying hard enough.\n\nFrom my previous experiences with this developer, I know what to expect: a game with countless flaws that showed promise and is occasionally, for very short periods, brilliant. Arma was like that, Take On Helicopters was like that, and DayZ is like that. They're very ambitious, and that's admirable, but they have no tenacity, patience, or follow-through.\n\nIf you get it on sale, like I did, you'll have a fun ten hours or so before deciding to just wait for the full release. But seeing as how they say that'll be in February, I'd say you should wait until the patch/update schedule has slowed a bit, because there should be a lot of them.","November 28, 2015","false","113.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

From a technical standpoint it's a great piece of software, but it's simply not engaging.\n\nUsually games, even though they might be hardcore (Orbiter, Dwarf Fortress, even KSP) make you feel rewarded when you achieve your goals. Even when those goals are self-imposed, you have a sense of achievement.\n\nImagine setting out to land on Eve and take off in KSP, or gather enough diamonds in Minecraft to make yourself a full set of armor. The game knows nothing about your objectives, but it has built-in impedements that make you feel you are working for something, and the game is balanced in such a way that, the more crazy your objective, the more difficulties you will encounter. And besides that, you have different tools at your disposal, in a way that you feel you have the freedom to attack the problem from different angles.\n\nTake on Mars feels like you are just following a fixed list of steps (missions are exactly that actually) in order to put a checkbox in your to-do list and move to the next item. You have very little room to improvise or be clever about how you approach the missions, and the hardships you encounter are just not interesting nor really challenging.\n\nAs someone who has spent hundreds of hours playing the hardcore space flight sim Orbiter I would never have imagined a game like this would bore me. But sadly it does.\n\nThe research tree is very rich, and the mechanics of building and deploying vehicles are rock solid. Perhaps the problem is the game is too linear for a sandbox.\n\nI'd wait until the developers fulfilled their vision for the game completely before buying it. Wait and see mode.","October 17, 2014","false","4.1"," 15 of 34 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","15","34","0","5"

The visuals are stunning, and it has the potiential to be a great game. Unfortunately, at this point in time, its not. Its full of annoying bugs.\nI've just spent the last hour playing the single player story line, started researching more advanced probes....then the game crashes, and its corrupted the entire save...gone. Won't be starting it again.\n\nThe "base building" is so difficult to control in the scenario mode that I gave up and didn't bother any further. Its such a convoluted control system, and the parts are very hard to get aligned at just the right angle for them to snap together. This issue pretty much extends to the entirely of the control interaction within the game.\n\nIn the early access version, over 75% of the tutorial videos are not accessable. This leaves the player to flounder around,and try to figure out what to do, and how. Surely, this is a rooky error?? Tutorial videos are there for a reason, so not having them is very counter productive.\n\nIf all the issues were sorted out, it would be a very good game, but at this point, I think its £15 I would have rather spent on something else.","October 30, 2015","false","20.4"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","2","8","0","0"

The game has some appeal in the realistic approach it has taken and i'm sure if you're a patient person you could find this game rewarding  if you're into simulations.

I understand it is early access (multiplayer) but the state it is in it should not be released at all. The campaign works fine, however God help you if try to play multiplayer because it will crash because "out of memory" when I have allocated 2gb of ram to take on mars alone, and have 20gb in all. If that doesnt happen then it will crash for some other reason. If you are lucky enough that it doesnt crash then you will end up getting killed doing anything from getting out of the seat in the capsule, getting out of vehicles, using the elevator in the capsule, or from using the beds (which ironically is how you heal your character). It seems they are more concerned with putting  content in the game than fixing old problems. Honostly I want it to be a good game but it doesnt work. The campaign works but it isnt finished. The analysis always says the same thing and the objective is always either: search the area for something scientifically interesting, take sample, or take a picture.

Now we're at the end of the 2nd Oculus dev kit and consumer Oculus is only a few months away. The Take on mars developer has no interest in supporting VR and one of the devs has blamed Oculusvr for this: "Originally posted by Dram:\nHey guys, I am unsure at this point about Vive, but the Oculus will certainly not be supported. Since the newest 0.6 drivers they removed DirectX 9 support. TKOM runs on DX9, which means we're out of luck.\n\nJust to clarify, they needed to make the move to better support direct to Rift mode, so I perfectly understand their move as being unavoidable. Pity though :)"  << The question is why a game still in development is using the outdated DX9 engine? DX11 has been around for a long time and we now have DX12.  I would say the problem isn't that oculus implemented direct-mode only but that Bohemia are developing their games on the outdated DX9 API.\n\nVR aside... the game as it stands is pretty dull.","November 9, 2015","false","7.4"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","1","6","0","0"

This game has some serious potential, good developers, good concept, BUT, it is nearly impossible to get into. Sure, if you spent all day and looked at dozens of guides and tutorials, practiced, and dedicated your entire day to learning it, maybe it would make more sense. But for a dumby like me who just wants to chill and play a game in my spare time, its difficult to really play this game for more than 10 minutes without getting a headache. It might be a good game, but reviews are about whether or not I would reccomend it, and I would not. If you want a mars game similar to this, I would reccomend Sol 0. Its not first person, but it is still very interesting.","August 17, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

I really hope the developers continue to shape the main aspects of this game, as the concept does have a lot of potential.\n\nThe big issue in my point of view, and why I'd not recommend it at this time:\n\nVery linear gameplay, for an exploration game it lacks the "open world" feeling. This is immediately evident when you execute your first mission, you can see a rectangular plane of mars, your mission area, floating in the void of space, in the early descent phase.\n\nThe career part is mission based, so instead of conducting free-form exploration, the player launches a vehicle to perform a very specific set of tasks.\n\nThe first ten missions you will launch for example consist of nothing more than selecting a point on the map, launch the vehicle, look at the descent phase, wait for the "exploration accomplished" info to pop up, and immediately disconnect from the vehicle as the mission is done even before you touch down.\n\nThe next couple of missions involve you actually waiting until touchdown, activate one instrument, and disconnect.\n\nThe vehicle design suffers from similar issues, it is just way too linear. You basically select a chassis, stick some instruments in predefined slots, without any real freedom in design.\n\n\nI really want to like this game, and in fact I do not regret investing the 15 bucks as it might get somewhere someday, but at this time there simply does not come up any real fun playing this.","December 13, 2014","false","4.7"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","0"

Things will be a bit buggy, but this game was full of bugs I encountered, as well as actually getting the hang of the game, which I still didn't after 2 hours. Sure, I played with some people but when I played with them, I felt absolutely useless because it was impossible to understand how to actually play, Now for the bugs. OK so, this game was a waste of money, in my opinion. For bugs: When I was joining a server, I clipped out of the lobby thing somehow(WTF?) and then when I actually got to the map, I was trying to help, and the game got so laggy. And then, while I was printing something I got stuck so that I couldn't move. After wasting 30 minutes, I just decided to leave. Of course, in some peoples eyes, this game will be fun, but not in my eyes. I will gladly change my review later on if the game gets better.

Um.... ♥♥♥♥ you? Way to tell half the gaming demographic they're a low priority.\n\nHeck, I'd volunteer to do the voice acting if that would help, but then they'd lose an excuse. It's not as if the male voice acting is winning any awards.  A passionate volunteer with a quality mic and a pop filter, can easily do about the same.","March 16","false","0.7"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","2"

Downloaded it, installed it and double clicked on play. Straight to the options menu and run in windowed mode and then changed my mind and put it back to full screen mode. The first screen that greets you is the Take On Mars menu with the usual game options and a spinning depiction of planet Mars. You can hold down the LMB and spin the planet around and see cool sounding names like - Syrtis Major and Elysium Planitia. A few clicks and the initial tutorial loads up.  Clicked on Real World Time and eventually I make my way to the Lab and Construction Building. Found myself pressing the 'Test Vehicle' panel & see the lander. I see different views and instruments, You see (not manipulate) the outside world. My first test ship wobbled like crazy and the wide angle and telephoto view quality, looked like they had purchased the same cameras used in the Blair Witch project. Maybe it's an early alpha thing? I think Bohemia are simulating the quality of video/pictures sent from Mars back to Earth -- lossy and crap. Like any man on the planet who has never read an instruction manual since making 1/32 Airfix models, I end up pressing every single key to see what screens pop up. Oooh... aaarghhh... what does that do... oohhh.... Esc key goes to Main Menu.  Yawn and fast forwarded to the Launch vehicle 13mins 39secs. Look around the crater for about six or seven minutes and then stumble on the list of tasks required to be completed in this particular mission.\n\nAfter pressing every key again, q,w,e,r,t,y,,,,,. I find myself at the Capture Gas stage. oooh... aarghhhh.... Click on Capture Gas. Yay! DO NOT MOVE INSTRUMENT in flashing red text. First you capture the gas, then you analyse gas. (Insert Fart Joke) This is one of the Major Tasks completed at the initial first assignment Victoria Crater. Your initial foray in the Victoria Crater teaches you Mars atmospheric pressure differences compared to Earth and also the composition percentages of CO2, N & Ar (I knew learning the first twenty elements of the periodic table would be useful in my lifetime.. thanks to my grade 10 science teacher Mr Clewett). Once you complete a mission, you also get access to New Tech Levels and various vehicle and instruments at tech level 2 become available.  And I got a steam achievement unlocked "It's All About the Science" I then read the rest of the Mission task and see there is another minor task, a photo opportunity requirement.\n\nThe light bulb dims and I figure out that mission tasks are comprised of Major task and Minor tasks. Each successful completion of Major & Minor tasks during a mission will allow you access to higher level tech and more cash to spend on stuff. In the Early Access version, I can see some instruments have power levels and charge / drain rates and I guess that there would be that certain tasks that require balancing energy usage from your chemical batteries before they are depleted in the later missions. Don't know yet if there are ways to recharge. It's interesting but not for everyone. Interesting enough I had the game freeze on me twice and waited and waited and waited.... before the three finger salute Ctrl+Alt+Del restarted the game.\n\nMy initial thoughts coming from a Flight Sim enthusiast...... Well just like there are people that are vegetarians and there are people who like a medium rare wagyu rump with a side of hand cut fries, mushrooms swimming in a red wine jus. Take On Mars just doesn't have enough meat to satisfy me. Do your own due diligence and make an informed decision. Read the reviews, watch other videos and then make a purchase or not decision. I 'm not satisfied. If I want a space sim, Kerbal Space Program has that creativity streak that Take On Mars doesn't. Would I play Take On Mars often? Only if my Warthog HOTAS was stolen, and every other computer game I owned was destroyed and it was raining outside and it was a Saturday in June. Aside from that, sure I will play it.\n\nAnother thing, what is early access, an alpha, beta or in-between? Call it what it is - an Alpha....\n\nThanks go to my grade 10 Science teacher Mr Clewett -- You were right, I would use the knowledge of the first twenty elements in the periodic table in my life time. :)\n\nScore: 2/10","March 2, 2014","false","3.0"," 8 of 32 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","8","32","0","0"

You'll do a lot of that until you can build up enough money to start doing more interesting things with rovers and landers.\n\nThe recent addition of the multi-player component adds a massive amount more to the game, giving you the ability to build your own little mars base and keep yourself alive... but it's definitely in its infancy.\n\nGraphically it's lovely.  Gameplay... early stages.\n\nIf you like the idea of exploring Mars, and quite fancy the thought of building your own base there, then DEFINITELY keep this one bookmarked. However, I'd recommend waiting until there's a bit more development before getting too excited.\n\nIt has a lot of potential, and I'll recommend it on the strength of that alone.","January 11, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bohemia has made great progress with all the updates, and I'm playing it again after almost a year away.\n\nI liked the concept of this game from the moment that I came across it in Early Access and bought it.  It's the kind of game that I wanted to like so much, and have played for enough hours to give it an honest chance.  As others have said, It is NOT intuitive.  So, you have to find your own way through it most of the time - but I don't fault it for that, and in fact kinda like figuring stuff out.  I'm a 'don't help me - let me figure it out on my own' guy anyway.  So now, the rest of the story...\n\nI break TKOM down into two categories:\n\n1) Multi-Player - Let's be fair: Pass!  I didn't buy it for the multiplayer, and haven't ever launched that part once, so I'd refer you to other reviews for pros and cons on this part. Moving on...\n\n2) Solo Play is divided into two sections:\n\n- First, the "Space Program", where I was immediately bored silly by launching an endless string of probes around the various craters on Mars, and completing photo recon, atmosphere & soil testing, etc.  I'm not knocking it!  It just didn't do it for me, y'know?!  That said, I never had any issues with it, and it was stable - so, the "Space Program" just wasn't my kind of game, but you may like it fine.  Snore.....zzzzzzzzzzzz XD\n\n- Second, the "Scenarios" option.  This is the place where I spend my time.  In this mode you are on the surface and can harvest resources, build a base, and have free rein, and I now find this part absolutely fantastic.  The modding community is active with all sorts of new add-ons and new scenarios to try.  When it comes to base building, you have the original Outpost style that is fairly user friendly to build and looks really good.  But now, you also have a different style base option called Modular, and it opens up the ability to have more complex, multi-level bases.  With the original Outpost style, when you build a wall, floor, window, ceiling, whatever, it just requires lining up the one, single block and your DONE.  But, with the Modular base, OMG, for a single section of wall, you have three layers to build, exterior, interior, and a final finished skin for the interior.  Two things - a) personally I like the simplicity of the Outpost style, and much prefer the looks; b) The Modular can take hours to build a single room, even with the 3D printer right next to you and running non-stop.  It might be worth it to me if it looked better, but I thought it looked like a building from some Gulag prison colony on Mars xD.  That said, I'm sure it would go together in a snap in multi-player with a team working on it.  It's really just a matter of taste.\n\n(BTW - My earlier review detailed the frequency of crashes every 30 minutes during gameplay, and happily, that is a thing of the past - I now find the game quite stable.  Another annoying quirk of earlier version was that when your character exited a bunk, chair, anything, after resting, he would seem to bounce around the cabin as if Zero G, until he died of his injuries LOL - This issue has resolved in newer versions).\n\nAlso, in my initial (negative) review I DID SAY  that TKOM had phenomenal potential... and it has completely lived up to that, with all the great updates.  Good work Bohemia.  I would still like to see an auto-save feature built into the game, but manual saves work fine for now.\n\nI hope some of you found this helpful. Cheers.","June 18, 2015","true","186.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ammended review:\n\nIt's been in Early Access for (literally) years now. At some point it becomes an excuse for developers to never finish something, or always be able to promise "more features in the future" - which is what's happened here.\n\nI was severely disappointed several months ago when I realized they no longer cared about science results and testing of Mars and started focusing on the multiplayer aspect, but I know teenagers/gamers are the target audience on Steam, so I wasn't completely surprised by the shift. However, that was nearly a year ago. In that time, nothing has changed in the single-player "science" campaign at all. It's been the same thing since I bought the game years ago. I really, really wanted to like this game, but it's just not meant to be. I mean, how long can you call something "beta", yet make money from it, and get away with it?\n\nIf Bohemia can own up to the failures and shortcomings and put some TLC (ie. patching, time, development, and customer concern awareness) back into this, I might switch back to a positive review. But that is very doubtful at this point. They've run out of time for me.","April 29, 2014","false","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And its pretty much dead the state its in. But it's still a great game don't get me wrong.\n\nManned:\nThe manned side of things is great, they have made some big changes and have been good as. It however still needs some improvements and the manned space program is yet to be finished.\n\nIMO, I got quite a bit out of it, however, it was supposed to be in 1.0 in June 2015 I believe. Which is\nunderstandable, because Bohemia are working on 2 other games which are Arma 3 (which is going to launch a DLC in about april or something) and DayZ. But bohemia's system of working on games makes progress really slow. If they were going to work on 3 games at once they are probably going to need a bigger crew.\n\nSpace Program:\nThe space program is great! you really have to think about lots of aspects except launching and landing your craft. Unlike Kerbal Space Program, it thats a larger focus on Mars, and all it has. KSP focuses on many areas like launching, landing, designing and going to other planets along with orbit mechanics. However it doesn't really go into the science of analyzing of the planet very much but KSP is a completely different game.\n\nBut really, I can recommend it to some extent however, the progress is very slow on the game.","January 8","true","157.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can build bases with friends, explore, drive roveres and do what you want. The developers have done a very good job with this game. I have played it for 3 years, and still today. It's also my favorite! Also it's almost a little like real life. If you want to expirience surviving on mars, this game is a very good simulator.","May 2","true","891.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
