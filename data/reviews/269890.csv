"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OneHandedSquire/recommended/269890/","OneHandedSquire","OneHandedSquire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OneHandedSquire/","168 products in account","There are two types of games I really hate to review: criminally mediocre games that you can't really say anything interesting about and games like AR-K, a game that has a lot of heart, but is like a busload of burning orphans careening off a cliff; a terribly executed, tragic waste of potential.\n\nUpdate\n\nWithin the day, I was contacted by one of the developers to tell me that they read my review and are working hard to make sure the next episodes live up to expectations.  That's great to hear!  By actually talking with me about my criticisms it reflects very well on AR-K's team and gives me even more reason to hope that it might come together and I can recommend it to everyone.  The review remains the same for now, but those interested in the community behind a work in progress may find that here.\n\nBack to the review\n\nHow shall I start to explain the trouble that is AR-K?  I know.  Look around your computer and try and find a belt or length of rope.  Just trust me.  I'm going somewhere with this.  Got it?  Okay, now fold it in half, grab it firmly by each end and pull it taut.  Now rapidly move your fists inward and outward.  The flapping movement you are seeing is quite similar to how the main character's mouth moves in the first episode of AR-K; outside of cutscenes, anyway.\n\nYou might think this is a minor gripe and adventure gamers have always had a knack for looking past poor and peculiar graphics.  And you'd be totally right.  But I'm only pointing out one teaspoon in an ocean of technical issues and bad presentation.  The volume of the spoken dialogue hasn't been normalized, there are a couple of misread lines, the subtitles have been poorly edited, you can't save on your own initiative or have multiple game files, the voices of characters are prone to change once or twice (probably artifacts from old voice actors), there's been some weird scaling when characters interact with each other, it took me about fifteen minutes to figure out how to get items from the inventory screen to interact with objects in the world, and the English localization has a few wrinkles.  That isn't even an exhaustive list.\n\nAlright, alright.  So that's all really quite terrible, but like I've said, we're fans of point and click adventure games.  We can forgive any kind of presentation in the name of good puzzles and and a good story.  Let's start with the puzzles then.  So, you've got an object on a high shelf that you want to get, a length of rope, and a large-breed dog.  What do you do?  Obviously, as an adult of average physical ability and a functioning brain, you ignore the rope and dog and climb the shelves, get a nearby box to stand on, or you just wedge your arm behind it and push it over.  But you're playing an adventure game so you're probably already conditioned to ignore logical brevity and will do exactly what the game expects you to do: combining rope A with dog B.  That's a puzzle in this game I found intuitive and logical and solved within seconds of its presentation.  So, dear god, what kind of anti-backwards madness-dimension logic must be employed for me to call this game a completely illogical mess that demands a walkthrough?\n\nWell, let's examine one puzzle from episode one that I like in theory, but was so horribly implemented it was unsolvable.  In AR-K, you play an investigative journalist and there was a puzzle based around you asking other characters about a policeman so that you could create some sincere-sounding flattery to get him to help you.  That's a totally awesome thing for a game about an investigative jounalist!  However, the hints you actually get don't correlate to the actual dialogue options you're presented with during the flattery, at best.  At worst, they're totally misleading.  For example, you're meant to get his first name from a bulletin board where various people have left posts.  Now, the names on the board include three of the four choices you have in the dialogue and absolutely none of the bulletins suggest character traits specific to an officer or to anything else you've learned about him.  In fact, the closest logical leap I could find is that one of them mentioned a feature of the specific area he was patrolling, so I assumed that must be the one.  Nope.  So to solve the puzzle you have to choose one of four dialogue options correctly four times.  The game will not tell you which you have gotten correctly and none of your hints are better than my example.  Oh, yeah, and in episode one you can't cut off dialogue you've already heard (at least I couldn't find a way).\n\nThat's exceptionally awful.  And it's  doubly bad, because that's such a neat idea poorly done.  But it's not the worst.  Actually, episode one wasn't too bad.  There was one other highly questionable moment that I only solved by clicking everything I had on everything else for long enough to get a result, but only that dialogue puzzle sent me to a walkthrough.  Episode two, though....  Did I somehow kill your family without knowing it, episode two?  Is that why you tortured me so?  The first half was perfectly logical (well, dog-rope-shelf logical), but then there's a bit with a rat, and a trap, and you have to shoot it, and you have to... and you have to *rocking back and forth while crying*.  And then you're taking exams for some reason!?  WTF!?\n\nOkay, so the puzzles are half okay and half unsolvable moon logic.  That does not a good adventure game make.  But, hey, we've still got the story, right?  It's a noir thriller, with the cartoony charm of Sam & Max, and it's set in space - the best setting!  There's no way this could be bad, right?  Well, hmm.  It's okay.  Episode one starts off with a good noir hook involving a mysterious MacGuffin and ends with the uncovery of a sinister plot, a betrayal, and ominous forshadowing.  I even like the simple touch that we're playing a female investigator under the influence of a "homme-fatale" in a typically masculine genre.  However, episode one is just a lot of screwing around on a college campus with very little movement in the story.  It also doesn't help that the main character is kind of rough around the edges and performs some unlikable deeds.  And it's not so gut-bustingly funny that you can forgive the character's misanthropy like with your Sam & Max.  That said, episode two fixes all of those problems.  The plot thickens and things happen.  The protagonist actually appologizes for, say, maiming her mostly helpful roommate.  And, most importantly, a disembodied narrator is introduced that only the protagonist can hear.  There's some wonderfully funny lines between them and the narrator is able to voice our concerns with the protagonist's actions and manners.\n\nThe narrator is also supposedly there to give you hints, but these are as helpful as the aforementioned clues with the policeman puzzle.\n\nSo we've got a badly designed, technically messy game with a story that's all over the place.  No, I can't recommend this game.  I really wanted to.   If you had told me last week that I'd be playing a noir-themed adventure game in the style of Lucasarts or Telltale set in freaking space, I'd have said, "Yes!  All of this!  Melt it down and inject it right into my eyeballs!"  I want AR-K to be the video game equivalent of the underdog kids in an 80s sports movie, where after a synth music montage with a robot, the devs crank out an adventure game that beats down the big bully Triple A teams that give adventure games wedgies.\n\nMaybe it still can be that.  There are still two episodes that haven't been released and episode two was mostly an improvement over episode one.  In recent history, Tales of Monkey Island went from a mediocre first half to an adventure worthy of its pedigree.  I'll keep an eye on AR-K's upcoming episodes and maybe I'll have the good fortune to erase my work here and tell you how badly you need to play this game.  For now, though, I wouldn't.","February 15, 2015","false","6.1"," 194 of 232 people (84%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","84","194","232","40","0"

The 3rd episode is supposed to be released in January 2015 & the 4th about June 2015.\n\nI should start with the fact that initially i gave this game a negative review. AR-K was a total mess at launch; there were lots of glitches & bugs...BUT it changed a lot since then. All the bugs were fixed (at least the ones i've encountered), steam interface now works as well, and all the glitched achievements were also fixed, i tested them all myself. Lastly, starting episode 2,  a very cool feature was added - the narrator, which can give you clues on certain items. I was finally able to play both episodes from the start to the end without any problem.\n\nAR-K is an episodic point-and-click adventure with some very challenging puzzles, and has a very intriguing story which will keep you wanting more with every step you advance through the game. There are also a lot of funny moments which made me laugh out loud several time. One of the game's best feature is the voice acting. Simply outstanding, especially the main character. Overall, its a very enjoyable game. The only con left from my point of view is the resolution, which is 1280x768, and there is no option to change it from the launcher, it looks good enough in window mode, but if you choose to play in full screen - it will not scale up correctly and you'll also get a blurred picture as a bonus. However, the developer said, and i quote : "The next two episodes will be made in 1920x1080".\n\nLet's hope the next two episodes will be properly tested before released, so that players don't have to experience again similar problems, but so far AR-K is worthy of your time, and definitely deserves the attention of all classic point-and-click adventure players.","December 3, 2014","true","11.7"," 99 of 105 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","99","105","0","2"

Played both available episodes. This review initially did not recommend the game because of frustrating bugs. Shortly after posting it Sergio Prieto contacted me and fixed them within an hour and a half on a Sunday morning.\n\n+ Fantastic customer support. Seriously, wow.\n\n+ The chains of logic are mostly reasonable so "adventure game logic" isn't too bad.\n\n+ The voice acting for Alicia (from Ash Sroka, Tali Zorah's VA) is really, really good. It stands out above the rest of the cast, especially Episode 2's wildly inconsistent Narrator. No one in the cast is awful, just uneven in quality. Blaine and Nuno's VA are pretty good too.\n\n+/- The writing is uneven. Way too quick to break the fourth wall, characters jump from emotional state to another, the Narrator doesn't have a consistent dynamic with Alicia. It is also genuinely, laugh-out-loud funny at times.\n\n+/- Visually it is not good. It communicates what it needs to visually and cartoonish enough to Not Awful, but still not good.\n\n- The UI is awful. Example: First episode has 3 different sodas to use. Once collected there's no text identifying them in the menu. Just three nearly-identical items with disparate uses.\n\n- The UI is weird. Dialogue topics in the menu are treated like items that you give to NPCs. It is a weird choice, like it was made to circumvent some problem with big dialogue trees. Ambar is both an NPC and an item in your inventory in Episode 1, which is also weird.\n\n- As stated before: Buggy.\n\n"It's okay for an indie point-and-click adventure game" sounds like damning with faint praise, but I'm okay with the result and looking forward to future episodes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darthmarsden/recommended/269890/","darthmarsden","THE Darth Masochist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darthmarsden/","1426 products in account","IMPORTANT - This game is half finished. Literally - only two of four episodes are done. The only reference I've seen to this is in other user reviews, so... yeah. Be aware of this.\n\nIn brief: An very patchy game with potential, and it's hard to argue with the price, but ultimately not recommended due to poor puzzle design and interface issues.\n\nIn boxers: Another Kickstarter project, AR-K scrapped past its $100,000 goal by promising to be an episodic sci-fi point-and-click adventure "with an updated twist". Sadly, that twist seems to be how unfinished the game feels - which hopefully will be fixed down the line.\n\nYou are in control of Alicia, former cop-in-training who was forced out of the academy when accused of stealing a mysterious golden sphere that she finds in her locker. Now in training as a journalist, she must uncover the great conspiracy surrounding the sphere and yadda yadda yadda. After she dresses and gets to class, of course, since she was up all night partying.\n\n...the sad part? That synopsis does a better job of establishing things than the ACTUAL GAME. The introductory cutscene feels like it was cobbled together at the last minute, and the haphazard way Alicia's backstory is rammed down our throats in another cutscene some 30 seconds later doesn't help matters either. We're given no real introduction to this world or anyone in it before we're asked to care about some partygoing chick, and it takes quite a while for us to warm up to her... which really isn't ideal in an adventure game\n\nThe graphics aren't exactly amazing either. I know this isn't the biggest sin in the world - I've always said gameplay is the most important aspect of a game - but there's just something slightly off about the art style and it's incredibly hard to put my finger on. Maybe it's the character's proportions? I dunno. Have a skim through the game's screenshots and see for yourself.\n\nAnother nitpick is the interface, which I don't feel is particularly well explained. All you get is two screenshots with arrows pointing stuff out, but that's hardly going to sink in when you first see it, especially when it takes a good 10 minutes for you to start actually needing to use the information provided. A slightly more in-depth tutorial at the start of the game would have worked much better here... as would being able to access these 'how to play' images during the actual game rather than having to quit to the main menu every time you want to see them.\n\nSpeaking of the interface, there are things which are never explained that you need to use, and things that ARE explained which you can't use. For example: you'll need to use your dog to solve several puzzles, but it's never once made clear that you can actually select or use the dog for anything.\n\nAlso, there's supposedly a 'narrator' that can give you hints if you get stuck... but I couldn't find any trace of him in the first episode, despite his presence being mentioned in the tutorial. And that's a real shame, because you'll NEED hints - there are some very random puzzles in this game (like using the cola with the sewer? Where did THAT come from?) that make it far harder than it should be.\n\nOn the more positive side, the voicework is really good. The main character in particular is great, but everyone is generally of a higher calibre than I would expect for a game made by such a small team. The music, when it kicks in, is quite nice, and the story, once it gets going, is pretty entertaining. It's just such a shame you'll struggle to get to it, since it only really gets going about two-thirds through the first episode.\n\nThis is a game that, at the end of the day, still needs a lot of work. There's a lot of potential there, but the problems I've mentioned are big ones, and they really do get in the way of what I hope will eventually be a pretty decent game. It's hard to really recommend at the moment - but at least you won't have to pay a fortune to see what it's like for yourself.\n\n*UPDATE* - This game has receive several updates since I wrote my original review, and will no doubt receive more - or at least, I hope it will. I'll try and update this review with each update.","July 23, 2014","false","3.7"," 60 of 80 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","60","80","0","0"

If you enjoy older style Point and Click adventure games then this is likely up your alley. It seems very much an homage to the Monkey Island games. I can't directly compare the two, but it has some puzzles very similar to some in those games and even a direct reference in the dialogue at one point. I will say that in comparing it to that, it is very much in the older style point and click games. If vague clues, and running around just trying to combine every item with every other item, or trying to interact every item with every interactable part of the world isn't your thing then you may not enjoy the game.\n\nMy only real compaints would be it's a tad short, but I've yet to play chapter 2 which is also included so we'll see what that adds to the playtime. As well as mentioned in my original review, that I would of prefered a way to skip through dialogue with the mouse, instead of having to use the escape key. As well as the dialgue ending up being a little hokey at times, with humor being slightly heavy handed. There are still some technical issues I'd run into, the occassional game freeze with certain interactions, the sound sometimes skips or repeats itself or animations could be a little funky but if none of that is deal breaking, i'd say the game is definately an enjoyable experience.\n\nAs a footnote, I'd like to say a thank you to dev team. One of them had been in contact with me the past couple of days, taking information from me and giving me updates on fixes they had been working on that pertained to my issues. He found the issue with my anti-virus and the games engine, that was causing all the crash issues I was having and got me a workaround so I was able to play. Any dev team willing to help out the playerbase like that deserves recognition.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKeeping my original post here, though most technical issues are no longer appliciable. Ended up being an issue with my anti-virus and the Unity3D engine.\n\n*Update: One of the devs has been in contact with me, taken information from me on my issues and said they will be working on trying to fix what they can as soon as possible.*\n\nWish I could recommend this game, but as it currently stands for myself I cant. When it actually works, its a pretty fun retro style point and click adventure. The story seems interesting, the graphic styling is pretty good. Solving things so far hasn't been too over the top as far as I've been able to play. The only real non technical complaints I'd have for the game is the inability to skip dialogue without having to use the escape key, I prefer to play these types of games with only the mouse, so it's a little bit of a pain. As well as the writing being a little hokey, tries a little too hard to inject humor and it falls flat at times.\n\nBut when it works is not very often, between the game straight up crashing or freezing during interactions. Or the inventory UI becoming totally uninteractable without having to quit out of the game and then restart it, trying to get anything done is super frustrating when almost the entirety of the game is randomly trying to interact objects with things in the environment and its a crap shoot on whether or not the game is going to just freeze or crash every time you do. If they can fix these glaring technical issues, and the game is actually playable I'd be willing to update my review.","July 21, 2014","true","2.8"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","36","41","0","0"

The world itself is also fascinating filled with all sorts of technology and aliens of different species which is very appealing to me since I’m a big fan of sci-fi genre. The result is certainly very smooth and polished presentation of the setting and the characters. Great audio, with the voice of the protagonist Alicia voice being amazing and hot.

Like most good democracies everyone freaks out about this and she is disgraced and forced to leave the profession she loves, by being charged with a crime of stealing that sphere device. Game starts with Alicia finding herself waking up after a night of wild party and a wicked hangover. From here it is up to you to uncover the conspiracy surrounding the sphere and what it has to do with you.

Not a huge fan of the whole "Alicia hates the ex-girlfriend of a guy she doesn't even like that much with an unholy passion" angle, but otherwise I did find myself smiling a lot throughout. The addition of the fourth-wall-breaking narrator in the second act was a bit jarring at first, but I really enjoyed the interplay between the two as the game continued. Most of the characters are silly archetypes of the various characters you'd expect to see in a college-themed story, but with a bit of a sci-fi twist to them. The game is fully voiced and the voice acting ranges from "fine" to "excellent".\n\nI've encountered a few bugs so far, but the developer has been excellent about working to address the problems that I've had so I expect that on that front the game will only improve.","July 24, 2014","true","11.0"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

The game looks great and the script is pretty smart and clever. The voice acting is great. However, the episodes waste too much time on their individual themes. Episode one's primary focus is showing what a horrible person the heroine is. More on her character later. An entire episode is not needed to flesh out one character. The second episode is a slow investigation that prepares the player for the action they have been waiting for, which takes place in Episode 3, sold separately. In my opinion, the wait is way too long.\nI have been playing point and click games for a very long time, and I have not seen such ridiculous puzzles since the 90's. Episode 1 wasn't too bad, but Episode 2 was full  of puzzles that didn't make sense. Unless you use a walkthrough, prepare to do lots of trial and error item combinations.\nMy biggest problem is the heroine. I find her to be a rude, immoral, and an arrogant individual. In the beginning of the game, we learn she wants to be an officer, like her father. While in training at the academy, she is falsely accused of a crime. She is given the choice to either fight and defend her innocence or leave in disgrace. She decides to shame her family and not fight for her innocence. So she's got no backbone. She then goes to journalism school and tries to drown out the past with partying and one night stands, until she sleeps with the stranger that brings the events of this game into play. I'm sorry, but I can't stand this kind of heroine. Maybe this game will prove to be a kind of redemption story, but she's got a long way to go. Maybe the game developers are trying to show a more "real" person, but I just find her distasteful. I can't relate to her, and that to me is a big negative when you can't connect or care about the character. I will continue to play Episode 3 for completion sake, but it better be worth the two episodes I have played already.\n\nUPDATE: I have recently finished Episode 3.

I never regretted to have activated that key. Though the first chapter could have been... something that would have triggered a negative review.\n\nYou're Alicia, a young student in journalism, once a promising police officer, framed for something she didn't do. Being detested by her teacher but appreciated by her friends, loved by her dog, Alicia will be confronted to her nightmare: the sphere that ended her career... and when you think that she just wanted to make sure that she wouldn't be failing her year...\n\nIn the second chapter, Alicia is slowly uncovering the truth about her boyfriend of the day, one company that seems to hide something, without forgetting the police that is perhaps involved (at least, the higher-ups).\n\nThe game is a standard point-&-click, you discuss, you take items, you combine them, you try to trick people, you use your dog as a sidekick and... well, you hack terminals. The only problem stands in the difficulty of using the inventory  (don't ask me why I got a serious problem to take stuff out of the bag or to combine them) or at one moment, during the second chapter, to get an item.\n\nBut the first chapter depicted a heroin that seemed to have a big ego, like she was a snob, so sure of herself. The second chapter shows someone more humble and caring. I couldn't relate to her in the first chapter, as her ego wasn't even comical.\n\nThe graphics are good, colorful but the cinematics are for me, a little more greyish. The soundtrack is good too.\n\nThere is a problem with the achievements: the one with the jokes was a mystery for everyone as people unlocked it without knowing why it has triggered after many many tries, however, someone found the right procedure, but it took months. To find how an achievement works, you don't have to look into the code of the save file. That's what happened here.\n\nAnyway, I find 10 bucks perhaps a little high for the game, though the second chapter is saving game. Now, it's up to me to do the Great Escape, which is the third chapter and the famous achievement of idling during 8 hours ingame, without exiting.

On the one hand, I think the story is wonderful--very unique and interesting with really good voice over work, especially for a kickstarter funded project. On the other hand, this game is so full of bugs that it is barely playable. I have just encountered a game-ruining bug in Chapter 2 that is going to require a complete restart. (Bugs are a really big problem because there is no way to save manually, the game just saves continuously so the only options are "start at the beginning" or "continue.")  I just hope the developers will take the time to patch this game or find a way to remedy the bugs that ruin the plot because I think it has potential to be awesome. I'm going to give this a thumbs up because that's how hopeful I am. :)","October 12, 2014","true","8.7"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

Oh, wait, she's a journalist? Okay, all those behaviours can be excused. 11/10 for realistic characters and a Harry Potter-style purse that can hold literally everything.\n\nI got AR-K gifted to me by a good, generous friend who loves to give me games to review. I've played my large share of point-and-clickers, and I have to say, AR-K is easily one of the best I've encountered. The pacing, puzzle difficulty, humor, and writing are all very well-done. The game appears to be a set of episodes, and there are currently 2 available to play at the time of writing this review.\n\nIf you like point-and-clickers, a futuristic setting, good humor, and charming dialogue, then you will really enjoy this game. Fans of the genre must give this a try.\n\nThe aesthetics are nice - the artsyle is good and the amount of detail in the textures is well-done. You definitely will not have to worry about the game being graphic-intensive. I have to admit, I am a pervert, and I found the main character's ♥♥♥ a bit distracting at times (but that's just me). The music and sounds are very good, and combine with the excellent voice acting to give you a fun, refreshing gameplay experience. Sometimes, I can find myself getting a bit annoyed at voice acting for videogames - especially point-and-clickers - however, the voice acting in AR-K (especially for the heroine) is great. You have the option of skipping through dialogue if you wish. The cutscenes are also nice, and are never too long or dull.\n\nAs a point-and-clicker, the controls are fairly simple, however, there is no in-game tutorial (there is only a 2-page screen with an overview of the inventory system) - so you will want to check out how to properly use the inventory management system. I've seen a few threads on the steam forums asking about how to combine/use items, so don't be too alarmed if you are confused in the beginning - it takes some getting used to, but becomes easier once you understand how it works. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with point-and-clickers. I must admit, a few of the puzzles and item combinations were not necessarily intuitive at first, and a lot of trial and error may be common in your playthrough.\n\nIn the forums, I saw a comment by the developer mentioning that the game can take around 8 hours (I am assuming for the 2 episodes, unless I misinterpreted), however, I think playthroughs for the average gamer will realistically take a maximum of 5 hours, assuming you are having a lot of difficulty with the puzzles and are also reading every single dialogue piece multiple times. The two episodes have a fair amount of puzzles and content, and I look forward to the next instalments.\n\nDuring gameplay, you will have to do A LOT of item combinations, both within your inventory and in the game world. I enjoyed all of the item pickup cutscenes, especially since the heroine's bag appears to be able to hold an infinite amount of objects (of any size and shape). Another interesting element that I really liked is the questioning system - in your inventory screen you can also drag and drop character portraits for people you've met onto other characters in order to ask about them. A lot of the dialogue is witty and well-written. The heroine also has a dirty mouth, and there is a nice change/addition in the second episode. I strongly suggest playing in order.\n\nIMPORTANT! Please be advised, you must be very careful when reloading a saved game - if you accidentally pick "New Game," it will most likely delete your save. You must also be careful when exiting your game - I had to replay from the beginning because my progress wasn't saved properly.\n\nOverall, I strongly suggest that any point-and-click enthusiasts check out this game. It is also very user-friendly and welcoming to newbies to the genre. Give it a try!\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","January 6, 2015","true","2.7"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

This game definitely isn't an exception. The big one is this: some of these puzzles are just not at all intuitive; and if you absolutely refuse to use any guide then you might end up walking away from the game in frustration. I'd definitely wish the game was a little better about the puzzles' being intuitive.\n\nIn episode 1, it's that clues are really vague and don't really tell you what you need to know... In episode two, some of the puzzle solutions are even less intuitive, but the developer thought it could solve that by adding a narrator. You can ask the narrator to comment on quests or items, but in some cases he'll have nothing to say and in others it kind of remains vague. What's worse though; "asking the narrator" takes you out of the flow of the game, it's not fun and it's the wrong solution for the problem of the first episode.\n\nSo, that's the big problem with this game... But despite that I still recommend it. Why? Well, the game has a ton of "charm". I really like the visual style, the voice actors/actresses are good, the game has a really good sense of humor, the characters are fun and all different, it has funny references and the short videos are well placed, humorous and don't take too long.\n\nHeck, you know what? In a lot of aspects, this game reminds me of Day of the Tentacle. If you're not familiar with that game, it's one of the best classic games in this genre. The fact that this game (AR-K) reminds me of DOTT I think is indicative of the great atmosphere this game creates with it's scenes and characters.\n\nI might not recommend this game if it were an expensive game; but let's be honest. The game is cheap enough that, even if you don't like it, it doesn't hurt the wallet too much. Personally though? I really enjoyed / enjoy this game (am currently playing through episode 3).","July 18, 2015","true","21.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","1"

When I played it the first time, I couldn't overlook the gamebreaking bugs I found as well as some minor annoyances that cropped up here and there which hampered a quality adventure experience.\n\nWhat hasn't changed from the past builds is Greg Rucka's solid writing. While I think he was brought in at the end of the development of Chapter 1 and had to work with what he had, he does a good job at imbuing the various characters in Alicia's world with mostly believable dialogue. Alicia's voice actor, Ash Sroka, aka Tali from Mass Effect, still is the best of the bunch at making Alicia a prickly character but one I can follow for this adventure. The other voice actors are serviceable, although I noticed that their audio levels in Chapter 2 seemed louder in a few places, like Mr. Wallruss in the diner.\n\nWhile the design of the game feels odd to me still, complete with some puzzles I think that could use some better hints, I'm happy to see that Gato Salvaje has started adding in descriptors for items in your inventory. Unfortunately not all items have them and I hope that they continue to add in good, solid description for items that, on first glance, you might be clueless as to what they are or where they came from.\n\nTonally the game is all over the place, but after at least three playthroughs now I'm used to its strangeness of being serious and ridiculous at the same time. Chapter 2 introduces a narrator that only Alicia can hear, and it's that coupled with its odd fourth-wall-breaking insistences that it knows it's an adventure game that make the story move at a weird pace. It feels a little like a game from the early years of Pendulo Studios, where you couldn't decide just with what tone their games wanted to run. There are still a number of typos to be found in the game's text but nothing so bad that a player can't follow along with the story.\n\nNow for the bug fixes; I still found some but the good news is I think they caught all the ones that were game breaking in the first two chapters. I hope this experience will bear through repeated playtests as well as going forward into Chapters 3 and 4. Also the horrendous audio pops that seemed to manifest after playing the game for extended periods was gone, which made playing the game much better. Alicia herself responded much faster I felt while clicking around the screen, moreso in Chapter 1 than 2, and her walk animation ran more smoothly. It was not game breaking but there were a few instances of characters being replaced with bright pink rectangles in Chapter 2, namely the robot butler in the apartment later in the game and also the professor in the test room after he's been distracted.\n\nAR-K is a strange game; It feels like a first time adventure title from a studio that wanted to break the mold when it came to how you interface with the game and organize your inventory, much like how Resonance from Wadjet Eye Games more slickly let you put research topics into your 'memory inventory'. While the first two chapters showcase a studio that's still finding their feet and their voice, I am happy to see them take responsibility for AR-K's faults and do their best to fix them. I'm not expecting them to fix any strange design issues; Deadly Premonition in its original form was a beautiful mess of game design that somehow worked, but most importantly it ran without any major bugs that glitched out the gameplay. I'm willing to forgive AR-K's design shortcomings if they're able to keep up with tackling any flaws that keep cropping up during the game's lifecycle.\n\nAnd for what Steam Achievements I found, they fixed! I'm currently unaware of how to get some of the achievements, but I suspect some may still be bugged, such as doing Chapter 2 in one sitting. The story progression achievements are working now, which is fantastic.\n\nThe length is decent for its price point. I think they could have bumped it up a little bit to make it fair when the studio gets chapters 3 and 4 out, but the price is enough for people to try it if they're curious for a new adventure game.\n\nIs this game worth it for $9.99? I'd say yes. It doesn't have Chapters 3 and 4 yet, but they are much more stable. Just be prepared while playing that you may run into some rough edges, but that doesn't stop it from being charming.","August 12, 2014","true","12.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

But like many, there are some painful compromises. The game itself is a solid, enjoyable — at times, hilarious — point-and-click adventure game in the modern style, there are several issues that linger. Despite those issues however, I player through Chapter 1 in about an hour, and had fun.\n\nMost glaringly, localization is an issue. Name structure and voice acting is inconsistent. On the other hand, the game is fully voiced — the player dialogue choices being the only exception. Also, some items don't update correctly, and require a restart. Some FMVs didn't end correctly and required a prompt.\n\nAs of Chapter 1, the logic puzzles are fairly starightforward, with small inventories reducing the need for much trial combining, which reduces a lot of the frustration. Alicia is snarky, and a moderately believable young adult protagonist, although she does suffer from Adventure Game Hero Syndrome — for an ex-cop, you sure commit a lot of misdemeanors!\n\nIf you liked The Longest Journey, or Deponia you'll probably like this.

The one you find unfolding as you play AR-K may not be the most original or complex, but definitely an interesting one. It also has a nice little touch of humour to it that, while will not make you roll on the floor laughing, still will give you some smiles.\nAnother important ingredient is memorable characters. While the main character seems more like a typical adventure protagonist, there are still some characters worthy of attention, like her manic depressive roommate, nasty alien ticket vendor or a politician that only uses streamlined phrases.\nThe music and the voice-over are nice, but nothing special. Still, the actors do their jobs well.\nThe only real downside is the interface that is not very comfortable and gets some getting used to. I highly reccommend you to choose "How to Play" in the menu before starting the game.\nAll in all, AR-K is a very nice game. Though, nowadays the point-and-click adventure lovers suffer not from the scarceness of good games, it still deserves its place in your collection.","April 15","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The bugs that I had playing the game have been resolved and achievements seem to be working. The game is very pleasing to the eye, with well-rendered cartoon-like characters and an interesting world in which to explore. The voice acting is well-done, though there are a few instances where the subtitles don't match up, which is a little strange because they are mandatory. For future episodes, I would like to see the puzzles telegraphed a little better, since there were a few times where you had to take the try-everything-with-everything approach. The ending of ep. 2 sets up a nice cliffhanger, where you want to see where the story goes next. Props to the developers for taking the time to listen to players and doing everything they can to make them happy. Bring on Ch. 3!\n\nPREVIOUS REVIEW: Until this game receives some MAJOR bug fixes, I cannot recommend it. It is probably somewhat telling that  0%  of ALL the people who have played this have gotten the "complete episode 1" AND "complete episode 2" achievements! I have run into multiple bugs in both episodes and so am unable to finish the game. The funny thing is, I played the first installment before it was on steam and did not have this happen. It's great to have Steam achievements and trading cards, but if you cannot play the damn game to completion, it means nothing!

I didn't really find much of the witty comments or any of the jokes that funny, I actually only remember giggling once in the game. Obviously this is a personal opinion of the game, some people will like it, some will not.

But I would like to play more if I have time, I like it. By the way if you don't already know, it was actually funded by a kick-starter campaign and has been available from other stores for some time already. Also the game is episodic and at the moment only a couple of episodes are playable.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/w4WgrRXf1WM\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm2FsM7M180\nThe game-play is pretty typical of classic point and click adventures. Interact with objects and characters, get a description or begin a conversation, pick up certain objects and figure out where they are used. I took a while to figure out how to play this game. I overlooked the 'how to play option' in the menu so that may not have helped. I often spent a lot of time scouring over areas over and over again trying to figure out what to do next. Often I couldn't find obvious clues and resorted a lot to just randomly attempting to use every item I had on every object or person that I could find. The protagonist rubbed it in by frequently making sarcastic remarks like 'or we could try something that works' lol. I eventually had to refer to a walk-through. I don't really think this can be considered a problem with the game. I think it's very typical and just the nature of titles in this Genre.\n\nI like how the game looks, I think it is well done. I like the dialogue, it's little naughty and sometimes there are some pretty amusing lines. I also think that the voice acting itself is good. The game brings back fond memories of Full Throttle and the Grim Fandango.\n\nAny gripes have about this game aren't really a big deal, just stuff like not being able to skip dialogue that you have already heard. I didn't come across anything to really dislike this game for. I certainly think it's worth a try especially if you are a fan of these sort of games.\n\nClick here for more videos =)","July 21, 2014","true","3.4"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","2"

Still, we see a lot of beginner's mistakes in the handiwork. Basically every aspect of the game is flawed in some way or another.\n\nNote: Review was rewritten to fit Steam's transparent character limit.\n\nHints\nIf you're playing this game, remember Space toggles inventory and Esc skips dialogue, e.g. failure-to-combine messages.\nNot getting a comment when using an object usually means you cannot use it just yet.\n\n+ Good voice-acting\n+ Pretty design, although not necessarily humanoid proportions (note down-scaled graphics)\n+ Basically interesting story\n+ As of episode 2: Narrator / hint system\n0 Largely showing off main char\n0 Subtitles not always fitting\n0 As of episode 2: Fast travel stations\n- Layered execution model (see below for corresponding problems)\n- No options inside episodes\n- Two-screenshot tutorial with false information\n- One, in numbers 1, save state\n- Basically very short episodes artificially extended by missing guidance\n- Insulting the player\n- Numerous spelling errors in the English version, including inconsistency of names\n- Inconsistent controls, e.g. description of objects, skipping of dialogue\n- Over-specific interaction areas/hitboxes, unclear transitional areas, a bit of pixel hunting\n- Out-of-screen labels\n- Sometimes shoddy walking animations\n- No scanning the room or changing interaction during walking animation\n- Background music playing with statics\n- Recovery times before letting the player interact again\n- Inconsistent story-telling, e.g. logical errors, continuity errors\n\nVoice-acting\nAs stated before, this is pretty well done. There is only one line missing in episode 1 (Franky), and one line in episode 2 sounds like it was recorded in a setup different from the rest of the lines.\n\nGraphical design\nThis is no Final Fantasy or WOW trailer but it looks nice enough. I'd say a lot of work has gone in the animation of the main character, which makes sense, and so some scenes feel a bit like they are meant to show off the main character, which is fine. Her ankles looked odd in high-heels, though.\nThere were a few graphical glitches.\n\nStory\nThe game is based on an interesting crime story but I don't feel like paying 8 Euro for an experience similar to the first two episodes. The player often doesn't know why they are doing something or why they cannot do something.\n\nNarrator, Hint system, Item descriptions\nEpisode introduced a narrator giving multiple hints on topics but none on items.\nThe narrator replaces the description system from episode 1 where right-clicking an item resulted in a description of the item - except for a few items where it didn't.\n\nFast travel\nEpisode 2 introduces fast-travel terminals which allow for skipping of up to 2 screens. But each station equals its own screen and there are  screens 3 screens away from a terminal.\n\nLayered execution model, Crashes\nStarting the game from Steam gives you a configuration screen. Clicking "Play!" closes configuration and opens a window where you select an episode which closes the window and opens a new one running the episode.\nThe configuration shows a number of option types but all you can really change is the graphics quality (which I didn't) and whether the game runs windowed which the configuration checked automatically for me every time except for the very first run and independent of the setting for the last run.\nEpisodes run without screen overlay which is available in the episode selector. No overlay means Steam won't capture screenshots. Play time is recorded and Steam achievements gained, though.\nFrom the community hub it seems this produces actual problems for Linux user - search for overlay in the discussions.\nEpisodes ignore resolution settings set in the configuration.\nI had the game crash several times.\n\nOptions\nThere are none.\n\nHelp screens\nThe game offers two screenshots with instructions pasted over them in part confusing and false. The player is told about the narrator which doesn't exist in episode 1. The help also states "touching an area transition will cause you to instantly travel to the next area regardless of the distance" which is simply not true. I really like it when games have that kind of travel and was subsequently disappointed.\n\nSave states\nThere is one save state, the one currently used with auto-save. No manual saving.\n\nSubtitles, Skipping\nThe subtitles basically fit what is said. Sometimes a word is missing. Spelling errors are numerous. Some names keep changing their spelling (Eduard, Schlozten). There are also unintelligible alien voices which must be read but "translation" of a 1-second sound piece may spans three lines of text.\nYou can skip subtitles but may skip more than the displayed text. In episode 1 it's possible to skip animations which was removed from episode 2 - I never again want to see the barman put down or take up his magazine again.\n\nGuidance, Game length\nYou can play through both episodes in short time (with skipping and a plan) - not optimised I timed 7 minutes for episode 1 and 27 minutes for episode 2.\nUnfortunately, the first play-through of an episode may take hours because the game is very bad at giving directions. There are clear objectives, e.g. "get me something to wake someone up." But often the player doesn't know what the next objective or even current problem is, e.g. at one point the main character tells you she has determined the next place to go but then she simply won't go there, no explanation, not even naming the place. So you advance the story elsewhere getting a concert ticket which suddenly allows you to go to the place. There is no connection to the concert and the ticket are not used after getting them.\nAt one point the main character actually directly insults the player - generally a bad idea but adding to injury in this game.\nYou can use your dog to do stuff but that is never properly introduced.\n\nBeginner's stuff\nOften interaction areas are over-specific, e.g. Ambar's interaction area is sometaimes way smaller than Ambar, similarly with the university building. If the player is supposed to interact with a thing let them interact with the whole thing or make a special thing in the thing to interact with.\nLabels of interaction areas can go outside the visible area, even completely so. Check the cursor's position and position the label of an interaction area accordingly, i.e. so that it can always be read in its entirety.\nWhile walking around you cannot scan the room (labels are inaccessible) or switch the current interaction.\nThere are a number of logical glitches, basically anachronisms, e.g. you can get your purse from the Lost&Found multiple times (not the brick though). When you deal with the coffee machine the first time the reflection in the cutscene doesn't correspond to the machine's state. The robot's final state in episode 1 is reflected wrong. The porters keys randomly appear. Franky's toolbox changes designs. Alicia says, access to photos on Nuno's requires a code, but Bollizei goes through photos without a code. Corpse Reviver dialogue available even after Nuno left. "He's standing right there" after Blaine left. No scaffolding visible from Nerd.\nAt some point the Exit from TFTF vanished (menu, exit and continue helped).\nI think, area transitions should be clearly distinguished from other interaction areas. This can be done by simply giving them a special cursor, e.g. a door or guidepost.\n\nAR-K is pretty bad. I guess one to three more weeks basically fixing guidance could make this into something worth a player's time and money. As it is I will not recommend AR-K.","August 23, 2015","false","15.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/world_phoenix/recommended/269890/","world_phoenix","(O.B.D.S) Phoenix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/world_phoenix/","111 products in account","IMPORTANT - This game is half finished. Literally - only two of four episodes are done. The only reference I've seen to this is in other user reviews, so... yeah. Be aware of this.\n\nIn brief: An very patchy game with potential, and it's hard to argue with the price, but ultimately not recommended due to poor puzzle design and interface issues.\n\nIn boxers: Another Kickstarter project, AR-K scrapped past its $100,000 goal by promising to be an episodic sci-fi point-and-click adventure "with an updated twist". Sadly, that twist seems to be how unfinished the game feels - which hopefully will be fixed down the line.\n\nYou are in control of Alicia, former cop-in-training who was forced out of the academy when accused of stealing a mysterious golden sphere that she finds in her locker. Now in training as a journalist, she must uncover the great conspiracy surrounding the sphere and yadda yadda yadda. After she dresses and gets to class, of course, since she was up all night partying.\n\n...the sad part? That synopsis does a better job of establishing things than the ACTUAL GAME. The introductory cutscene feels like it was cobbled together at the last minute, and the haphazard way Alicia's backstory is rammed down our throats in another cutscene some 30 seconds later doesn't help matters either. We're given no real introduction to this world or anyone in it before we're asked to care about some partygoing chick, and it takes quite a while for us to warm up to her... which really isn't ideal in an adventure game\n\nThe graphics aren't exactly amazing either. I know this isn't the biggest sin in the world - I've always said gameplay is the most important aspect of a game - but there's just something slightly off about the art style and it's incredibly hard to put my finger on. Maybe it's the character's proportions? I dunno. Have a skim through the game's screenshots and see for yourself.\n\nAnother nitpick is the interface, which I don't feel is particularly well explained. All you get is two screenshots with arrows pointing stuff out, but that's hardly going to sink in when you first see it, especially when it takes a good 10 minutes for you to start actually needing to use the information provided. A slightly more in-depth tutorial at the start of the game would have worked much better here... as would being able to access these 'how to play' images during the actual game rather than having to quit to the main menu every time you want to see them.\n\nSpeaking of the interface, there are things which are never explained that you need to use, and things that ARE explained which you can't use. For example: you'll need to use your dog to solve several puzzles, but it's never once made clear that you can actually select or use the dog for anything.\n\nAlso, there's supposedly a 'narrator' that can give you hints if you get stuck... but I couldn't find any trace of him in the first episode, despite his presence being mentioned in the tutorial. And that's a real shame, because you'll NEED hints - there are some very random puzzles in this game (like using the cola with the sewer? Where did THAT come from?) that make it far harder than it should be.\n\nOn the more positive side, the voicework is really good. The main character in particular is great, but everyone is generally of a higher calibre than I would expect for a game made by such a small team. The music, when it kicks in, is quite nice, and the story, once it gets going, is pretty entertaining. It's just such a shame you'll struggle to get to it, since it only really gets going about two-thirds through the first episode.\n\nThis is a game that, at the end of the day, still needs a lot of work. There's a lot of potential there, but the problems I've mentioned are big ones, and they really do get in the way of what I hope will eventually be a pretty decent game. It's hard to really recommend at the moment - but at least you won't have to pay a fortune to see what it's like for yourself.\n\n*UPDATE* - This game has receive several updates since I wrote my original review, and will no doubt receive more - or at least, I hope it will. I'll try and update this review with each update.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/269890","May 17, 2015","false","0.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","0"

This doesn't change the review (yet), but it's something that I never see on Steam. Definitely a huge plus if you're looking for developers who care about their game and the community playing it!\n\nOriginal Review\n\nAR-K is a point-and-click adventure game. It's seemingly set in a distant future where aliens and humans co-exist. The player controls Alicia Van Volish, a young adult who was making it far into the police academy before mysterious events resulted in her departure from the force. She has since become a journalist, returning to school to do so.\n\nThat's pretty much all I gathered besides some other introductory details before I got bored. The story was vaguely interesting, and Alicia's voice acting is really well done (most of it is, to be honest), but it's hampered by really odd graphics (why is the professor's head three times as big as Alicia's?) as well as the uninteresting point-and-click mechanics. This is ntohing that players haven't seen before. Walk around, click on stuff, click on stuff with other stuff, rinse and repeat. I barely made it through the first couple of story-driven sequences.\n\nWhat seriously brought the game down was its functionality. Launching the game brought up the typical Unity launcher for settings (which doesn't bother me, but I know some other people do find annoyance in it), followed by a separate launcher for the four "episodes" included in this game (two of which have released at the time of this review, two of which are still to come), followed by the actual episodes themselves. This is an awkward setup I rarely see on Steam, and it resulted in 1) my friends being notified three times that I was playing AR-K, and 2) not being able to use the Steam Overlay when actually playing one of the episodes.\n\nAdditionally, the game itself seems to be sporadically riddled with weird bugs or glitches, or other things that seem like should happen but don't. Some objects that seem interactable aren't, or aren't enough, and some areas that seem like Alicia should be able to walk to, she can't. On top of that, there are typos here and there that really should have been noticed, such as "Oh my godness". There's also some lines written into the game that are voice acted completely differently, which was really odd to see.\n\nAll in all, AR-K has a semi-interesting story, but it's brought down by the uninspired point-and-click mechanics, odd and low-quality graphics, and minor bugs and typos. If you're deeply invested in this genre, I would suggest getting it on some kind of sale and giving it a try. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.","December 16, 2014","false","1.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Episode 2 started off a bit better, making it up to merely mediocre, then spiraling back to poor.\n\nIf you got it for cheap on the Humble bundle, and just careen through on a walkthrough, and REALLY want a point-and-click adventure?  You would be hard pressed to do worse than this.  But if you're bored, eh, why not.  I guess it not crashing is a point in its favor?  Don't spend money on this, though.  This game is interesting in the way that a train wreck is interesting.\n\nWhere do I even start.  The voice acting for the NA version was tolerable, at least somewhat.  But the dialog skipping is poor.  If you miss a scene, good luck, because you will have to replay the ENTIRE episode.  But will you care enough?\n\nThe plot is contrived.  At best.  Complete career destruction with the planting of ONE stolen sphere?  No lawyers or due process?  To a rich kid with a connected father?  REALLY?\n\nThe models.  Tiny hands.  TINY HANDS.  I've seen fan-made Skyrim models that were really well made.  AR-K was not well made.  This modeling was "professional," yet it looks like it was crapped out by someone who barely knew how to do modeling of ANY sort in a week or so.\n\nThe motion capture seems okay, oddly.  I can deal with her shoving massive objects in a tiny purse.  And having a fast-travel terminal in nearly every room is pointless.\n\nAnd the adventure game logic.  Get a walkthrough, because this game is NOT worth your time of trying every item on every other item.  Ep1 was relatively straightforward, but Ep2 degenerates into *especially* crazy adventure game logic.\n\nI should really go play Longest Journey and Dreamfall again.  Those were actually good.  And Dreamfall was actually made (BEFORE this game) with models that don't make me wince!","February 5, 2015","false","3.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Finding my character stuck in front of the graphics for amongst other things, Ambar and buildings, the dialogue and written script conflict a lot and such simple things as gorge and gored are somehow beyond the QA of the company, episode 2's pointless narrator addition basically leaves the woman looking like shes lost her mind and all he does is serve to slow the game down even more. The games window is somehow synced about 5% off the screen of a monitor in fullscreen leaving you with clicking around in the dark outside of the visable screen or sitting in an otherwise terrible windowed mode.\n\nVoice acting itself is overall fairly mediocre with a lot of the people sounding disintrested in everything they say. The "use this with this" system is horrendus and finding the right part of an object the game wants you to click is increasingly problematic as the game goes on even area transisitoning gets fickle and that just involves clicking the sides of areas.\n\nDont set ya sights too high when going in to this and you might barely feel like you got your moneys worth, barely.","November 27, 2014","false","16.1"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

For starters, the game *only* launches in the maximum resolution of your main monitor - no lower resolution windowed mode - and since the game appears to be made in 720p, it comes off looking blurry when stretched higher than that.  If the graphics were sharper and in the appropriate resolution, AR-K might look really good.  As it is now (with only the promise of a possible future patch), the game is more than a bit on the ugly side.\n\nThe characters and story - The main character is a sharp tongued and witty young lady, but the game is so poorly written that she still comes off as bland and uninteresting, and you never really care about her.  The same can be said of the story.  I love a good story in a game, and often that will outshine gameplay and graphics, and that's what I was hoping for with AR-K.  Sadly, I never truly felt invested in the story, and after a couple hours of the tedious and often confusing "puzzles", I found myself just waiting for Chapter One to be over so I could move on to something else.\n\nThe gameplay - Point and click adventure games are a dime a dozen these days, so it amazes me that there are still developers out there who just can't get the gameplay formula right.  AR-K's puzzles are so entirely random that at times I felt I was just clicking and combining everything in hopes of moving the story along.   Very few clues and lack of clear direction to the story often left me wondering what to do next, and in a couple of cases I had to refer to a guide, which then left me thinking "how the hell would anyone figure that out on their own?!"\n\nFuture chapters -  Be aware that the game isn't complete.  The store page is very misleading in letting you believe you're getting the full game all in one go.  Nope, you're only getting the first two of four chapters, with the next two chapters being released separately (and charged accordingly), unlike most of the Telltale games, which let you buy the entire game and enjoy the chapters as they're released.\n\nOverall, I was looking forward to AR-K, but ended up extremely disappointed.  At this point I won't be purchasing the last two chapters, regardless of the price.  This game had a lot of potential, but the convoluted storyline, poor character development, and poor graphics options left me feeling like I wasted my time with this one.  I'd avoid it unless you're feeling brave and have a couple spare bucks to toss at it when it's on sale.","July 26, 2015","false","7.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

Sadly though, the game also has the graphical features of those (extremely) old Sierra Online games. This while the publisher had a kickstarter campaign to overhaul the graphics (think I don't wanna see how bad they were in the original 1st episode of the game :D).\n\nWhen I look at the game itself it TRIES to be funny, but it feels extremely forced and therefor becomes ALL BUT funny :( This is a real let down, certainly when you look at the awesome and funny trailers for the game here on the store and the greenlight campaign.\n\nGameplay is also an issue. It's an adventure game with point & click features (it's not a hidden object game!), but most of the time you just move your mouse over the screen in the hope that the cursor changes form so you can do something. With that, the adventure is set in the distant future, but there's not even a journal in the game. You 'pick up' your quests, your objectives are told right away, but you don't have a notepad of any kind to look back what you have to do. This is the main feature that made me turn away from the game. I mean, I'm not playing a game like Morrowind (release around 2001) where you have to keep track of your objectives by physical pen & paper.\n\nIn short, this game is not worth the €10 asked for it. Better wait till it drops dramatically in price or is dumped in a bundle if you're REAL curious about it...","July 29, 2014","false","2.0"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","6","16","0","1"

The visuals were crisp and the animation was good, with a '90s CGI aesthetic.\n\nOn the downside, the game design was badly lacking.  An adventure game needs to either make puzzles reasonably intuitive, or provide hints through dialogue, item descriptions, or readable messages.  If you expect players to do bizarre things like, just hypothetically, mashing bread in a helmet with a golf club to create itching powder, there must be more guidance involved than just expecting that the players will read your mind.  If players are thinking in terms of "I could try this... or maybe this... or else that..." the adventure is working; if they're thinking something more like "What does any of this junk I've found have to do with anything?" it's not.  AR-K falls into that latter category.\n\nToo frustrating.  Too much reliance on guesswork.  Too unrewarding.  Too bad.","November 21, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Being the first two installments, they establish the setting and characters, though the game mechanics are not polished. You will find the puzzles troublesome more on account of the user interface being clumsy and non-intuitive, and this is in addition to the puzzles being somewhat obscure (i.e., just keep rubbing items together until something works).\n\nThere is also a Q/A issue with respect to translation. For example, (in English) after some styrofoam cups call to the ground, they are identified as "glasses," which was confusing in context. Poorly translated words just adds unnecessary difficulty.\n\nIn part 2, there was additional problem with not being provided information or tooltips for inventory items, which again made things unnecessarily difficult.\n\nPart 3 is a more satisfying, polished experience, in terms of plot structure, character motivations, puzzle logic, artwork, and user interface. If you want to skip parts 1 and 2, then all you need to understand for part 3 is the following:\n\n\n-- SPOILERS --\n\nThe lead character (Alicia) was framed for having stolen a golden sphere, about the size of a softball.

I think this is really admirable and I will definitely be playing more to see the progress they make. I don't usually like point-and-click games but the world and humor has potential and I may very well change my review as the development progresses.","May 11, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you judge AR-K in the right context IMO this game is solid and the improvements are very notorious on the second chapter. Also enjoyed those acid dialogues and a couple of puzzles were a little bit unintuitives but sure i'll buy The Great Escape as soon as I can.","October 2, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visuals were crisp and the animation was good, with a '90s CGI aesthetic.\n\nOn the downside, the game design was badly lacking.  An adventure game needs to either make puzzles reasonably intuitive, or provide hints through dialogue, item descriptions, or readable messages.  If you expect players to do bizarre things like, just hypothetically, mashing bread in a helmet with a golf club to create itching powder, there must be more guidance involved than just expecting that the players will read your mind.  If players are thinking in terms of "I could try this... or maybe this... or else that..." the adventure is working; if they're thinking something more like "What does any of this junk I've found have to do with anything?" it's not.  AR-K falls into that latter category.\n\nToo frustrating.  Too much reliance on guesswork.  Too unrewarding.  Too bad.","November 21, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like female protagonists who are so "sassy" as to almost be mean, you'll probably enjoy this -- but only if you play it with a walkthrough because of the terrible "logic" employed by the creators of the game.  I would recommend ONLY buying this when it's on sale, and even then only if it's 75% off, or more.\n\n(note: I only got it because I had a bunch of money in my steam account from selling trading cards, and I like point-and-click style games, and it was heavily discounted on sale.)","March 8","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
