Simply chess is the centuries old game we all know and love. The "simply" moniker is paramount here as many chess or chess-inspired games have shown themselves to Steam before but none have seemed to get it quite right. This one does. Play against a scalable AI, an opponent in your home or against friends or random players online. Simply chess simply works, which at this point of video game chess seems to be a major accomplishment of it's own.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI've noticed a lot of people complaining about this game. Mostly because of the ad. Yes there is an ad that runs for 5 seconds before you play a match. If you pay 5$ it goes away. For some reason this seems to really irritate people. One 5sec ad seems to be driving people mad. Well the game is completely free so I personally think complaining about the ad is probably being a little bit spoiled. It takes longer IRL to set the pieces up anyway so i really don't see what all the fuss is about.","September 11, 2015","true","5.2"," 1,489 of 1,708 people (87%) found this review helpful 922 people found this review funny","87","489","1","922","54"

Avoid, avoid, avoid! You want free chess? There's several different things you can get instead of this. This is one of the worst implementations of chess I've tried. To the developer: if you have to release yet another chess program, at least make yours stand out. This one has nothing. It doesn't look very good, it has awful AI, it doesn't have normal chess clocks (fixed time per move instead), it glitches, and there are some serious very basic problems with it. Let's name a few shall we?\n\n* It puzzles me how the AI levels were implemented for single player game. Both on level 1 and level 100 difficulty, the opponents makes moves like he was a monkey and picked the random one available. It places pieces on squares where they can be captured and in general plays terribly. For reasons I can't comprehend, it is stronger for example on level 45 difficulty, but don't expect fireworks.\n* I started 2 online games and both times the board was flipped the other way. My pieces were on the top. I had white and I was moving pawns downwards. That's the weirdest thing ever... I searched for a button to flip the board to actually view it from the perspective of my pieces and I didn't find it.\n* Music glitches at random moments starting to make a repeated choking noise like a stuck gramophone.\n* If you lose internet connection, even while playing single player, you'll be bugged by some cryptic error messages covering your scren\n\nOn top of all these problems, it keeps annoying players with advertisements.\n\nWhy would you want to play it? Other than to farm cards or perhaps gain achievements if you're an achievement hunter. And also... Why would anyone give this positive reviews? In the field of free chess, this one is a step backwards. Not only other existing chess programs and services are better and more professional, but also they are actually free and don't annoy you with ads every time you start a new game. If this game was another genre, it wouldn't have any positive reviews, because people would just say "this is just a terrible rip-off of XXX, very poorly done". Here suddenly some people have mercy, and say it's good to have a free chess game, perhaps because they don't know any better.\n\nIf you love chess though, I recommend lichess.org for example. Everything there is free, more professional, there are flexible time controls and many very useful tools that can help you get better. And this one? It's just rubbish.","September 23, 2015","false","0.0"," 92 of 121 people (76%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","76","92","121","13","1"

This review is based on my experience pre-patches.\n\n~~\nAs a chess fan, this isn't bad. Had a single match vs a level 1 opponent and it went well. If this is was a project someone put together, it's pretty decent.\n\nFor a free to play game, I can't say much.\n\nThe quality of the music is terrible. The music broke about 5 minutes into the match anyway so it wasn't missed.\n\nThe game logic is standard as per other chess games. Didn't notice any problems and the computer player predicted most of my moves on level 1. A minor feature that bothered me was the lack of dragging pieces. Clicking worked fine though.\n\nOverall, it did what it was supposed to. However, the reason I'm not giving this a recommendation is there are much better options elsewhere.

While the attempted targeted military assault on an enemy head of state may sound like a brutal, bloody premise, it should be mentioned that the graphics have been toned down to a degree that lets you easily forget that this game is basically about two armies trying to obliterate each other.\n\nSound:\nThere's sound. If you like classical music, you'll like the sound here. Because it's classical music. Also, no dying screams of the lowly soldiers whose hopes, dreams and future are thrown away to enable the continued decadence of their ruling class, so that's a plus. Or not, if you're actually into that sorta thing, you creepy, disturbed human being...\n\nCharacters:\nThe units in the game each have unique... I guess we could call it special moves. Or just moves. Let's go with directional capabilities.\nYeah, the unit types all move differently. In terms of balance, the game does a good job of evening the playing field between the two sides, even if White tends to have a systematic advantage, getting a headstart in the default mode (which one may change if one is so inclined).\nOther than that the factions in the game are not all that different from each other - a stroke of genius that supposedly aims to make the player think how both sides in a war are usually just staffed by poor schmucks who get to suffer the consequences of their respective leaders' poor life decisions.\nThe game has strong RPG elements, such as upgradeable units (pawns can level up to become queens if the requirements are met) and... yeah, no - that's it.\nI'm sure that, given enough time, the developers will get the hang of balancing the various units in the game - as of now, queens are hopelessly OP and just waiting for a nerf.\n\nDifficulty:\nThe single-player AI can be adjusted from "disinterested cat randomly trying to push pieces off the table" to "knows how to play chess much better than I do" up to "dear Kasparov, how are there still so many difficulty levels above my skill-level".\n\nVerdict:\nIt's still chess.

Simply chess. Chess, probably the greatest board game of all time, with no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, just chess. It has pawns and ♥♥♥♥, even ♥♥♥♥ing knights! It's brilliant. So, if you like chess, download this ♥♥♥♥. If you don't like chess, what the hell are you doing here? If you think you might like chess, grab this from steam, its worth it and here's why.\n\nEven if you have no idea how to chess this game is worth it. Rules and moves can easily be looked up in the game, there are a hundred skill levels for playing against the computer, so no matter how good or bad you are, you can have a fair match.\n\nEverything is very basic and simple, which I consider good. You can either have a 2D view of the board, or a nice classic 3D chess set.\n\nThe singlebest thing about this game though is the multiplayer. The only thing I don't like about chess is that pretty much nobody else I know likes it. Now this is a problem of the past. No longer do I have to nag people to play chess with me in real life.\n\nAs far as I could tell from the couple of hours I've played there is a decent amount of opponents to be found in multiplayer and if not, it's easy to organize a game between steamfriends. The only thing this game could have done better is the chatsystem for multiplayer. It would be nice to be able to talk to your opponent in the game itself without opening the steam overlay.\n\nThe best thing about this game though is that it is free! Yes, that's right!!! That means you don't have to play any money!!!! It's so ♥♥♥♥ing incredible I'm not even ashamed of my use of multiple exlamation marks!!!!! (!, !!, !!!!!).\n\nSo big thanks to whoever made this chessgame happen on steam, if you ever need your ♥♥♥♥ sucked give me a call.","May 18","true","17.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","8","8","4","0"

But they can be removed for a reasonable price.\n\nThe dev team have been quick to fix bugs, and have kept in constant contact with the community. The game is plain, and could do with some improving. But it is clear that they listen, and for any issues, just approach the devs through the discussions.\n\nOn a side note, anyone complaining that this game is free, and saying that is a bad thing? You are absolute morons. It is free, and to try to use that as a negative purely on the basis of it's being free is inherently anti-consumer. You can literally test out if this game is for you, without paying a penny up front. Buy premium if you want to feel like you've bought this game. otherwise, just enjoy that it's free.\n\nOf everything on steam, a decent, free chess game with a responsive developer is a breath of fresh air, compared to all the pay-for Slaughtering Grounds and Temper Tantrums that just want your money and don't care about quality.\n\nOf course, this isn't the best chess game out there. but with the dev team pushing through the bugs, and their quick response time to critique, I've no doubt in my mind that this game will get better.","September 16, 2015","true","3.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

There's a lot of people playing online, so it's easy to get a game started.\n+ The developer is active with the community and is fixing the bugs.\n\nNegative\n- The game is lacking polish and has a few minor bugs. (I've reported these on the forum)\n- The game displays adverts before games, but these adverts are only about five seconds. They are not annoying/flashing/etc - they are just static images of other games by the developer. This is a very minor negative and is easily outweighed by the game being free.\n- The AI-25 achievement is very grindy. Experts (not me!) who could beat the high levels would have to intentionally play lower levels to get this. A better idea would be achievements like "Beat at least level 20" etc.\n- There's no click-and-drag method to move pieces.\n\nOverall it is great that we now have a free chess game on Steam, which is in a playable state.

Chess is supposed to be that you have so\nmuch time PER GAME, not per turn like you in this version.\n\nPer turn is stupid.  (But not a problem vs AI.  Against AI,\ntake as long as you want, and then it moves quickly.  Very\nnice.)\n\nBut online, per turn clock (instead of proper per-game clock\nmeans you either pick a long time limit, and might have\nto wait way too long for early moves and end-games\nwhere there might just be 4 or 5 piece left on the board.\nPick a short time limit, it might not be enough for the mid-game,\nwhen you need to think things through.\n\nDefault time limit seem to be days, or sometihng like that.\nHardly reasonable.\n\nSo, if you're a very "casual" player, it's a good game for vs.\nAI.  Try to see if you beat each of all 100 levels.   If you're a\ngood serious player, well, this game is probably overpriced at\nfree.","March 21","true","138.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Thanks Devs! 1) The sound levers don't work at all,\n2) the upgrade to unrestricted version doesn't work,\n3) the visualization is pretty terrible in 3d,\n4) and you should not be able to quit in the middle of a game, even against AI.  It should count as a loss or resignation.\n\nThe sound is bad because the music is annoying.  I mean, I don't mind classical music, but I shouldn't be forced to listen to it like torture.  The visualization is also quite terrible.  I can barely see the dark  color pieces in the 3d version color scheme.  The colorizing needs to be done better with more highlights in order to see the pieces well.  The upgrade pops up some strange screens to sign up for something else.  I tried it, never received an email, and got an error message instead.  Makes no sense really.\n\nIt should be improved.

But, im sure the concept of the game is pretty easy to understand\n\nGameplay:\n\nReally good gameplay for a game about chess. 100 different levels of ai which means lots of playing this game. I would this game as more as a timewaster then a main game to play. Also, ehances chess skills. But, on the negative side it is kinda of annoying when you select the wrong piece and you forget which key to change piece. But, never the less it is still a good game. The multiplayer seems instresting. But, I have not got a chance to play it because I didn't want to sign up for account.\n\nRating:\n8/10\n- Great game concept. Few annoyances.","April 17","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You can set to any level you wish by yourself with the computer and it has 100 levels, the higher the level, the harder it is. It's a good game to sit back and enjoy, also a major plus is it automatically plays classical music (but you can't select the songs you hear, just 2 or 3 really that are on the main menu and in the game itself). Very diverse for a chess game, the best of all it's free :)","February 17","true","73.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's chess, plain and simple, plus the fact that it's free makes it better. The fact that it has steamworks is another huge plus.\n\nThat said, the game does have some issues. The biggest one is the lack of an actual resign button, meaning that if a player wishes to quit, they have to go AFK until the timer (7 days by default, but can be altered) runs out . There are also weird glitches that pop up all over, but the developers are very active on the forums and have been issuing patches daily. The worst glitch currently is that if you win by the other person running out of time, it doesn't actually log as a victory.\n\nProblems aside though, having a mostly well-made, Steamworks enabled, and free Chess game is very nice. I'm sure the bugs will be sorted out. Also, the people whining about ads are dumb, IT'S A FREE GAME. Being free lets this have a larger playerbase than it probably would have gotten and the ads aren't even bad. Also you can pay 5 bucks to remove them.\n\nEDIT: They have indeed added a resign button.

I stomped the level 1 AI, but I'm drawing from my experience as an ex-professional USCF player.  New players may find level 1 to be a bit of trouble, which isn't ideal or make sense when you have 100 difficulty levels to choose from.

This shouldn't take long at all. Next, verify your game's integrity cache. Also, make sure the game will NOT use the Steam Overlay in-game. Be sure to turn off Steam Cloud Sync as well for this game. Now, start the game in administrator mode. Your game should start fine now.\n\nWait for a patch for this problem to be fixed.\n____\n\nThere are only two races to choose from when starting a new match, black and white.\nI suggest playing as white since they are better and have advantage in most cases. Mainly because they have the priviledge of having to be able to move first. That means they can set-up their defenses and offense slightly faster.\n\nBoth races basically all have the same soldier types, the only difference is if they are white or black.\n\n____\n\nI hope maybe sometime in the future maybe this game can be able to be moddable and have the Steam Workshop opened for it. Some people ask me "Why would it need the Steam Workshop, what would people be able to change anyway?!". Well, I wouldn't mind if it was possible to be able to create custom unit skins. I'd be cool to have a custom "Unit Picture" when playing in the 2d mode. I want to make my unit avatars into a female form when playing in 2d mode!\nIf it could be possible to make custom 3d models for each unit it would be cool too.\n\nIf us players could be able to do what I said above, I would greatly appreciate it. I like to feel like a a commanding general when playing. Having my units look like the way I want them in either custom 3d model/2d unit picture would be nice.\n\nIt would be pretty funny to mod in some kind of voice file that plays when units die. Or a voice file that plays when you get checked/check mated. Even better, to have a custom music file that plays when your King is checked. Like some kind of song. Like this as an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8bSoHB50jE (For in-game, I suggest the song to start at 1:08 since the build up in the beginning of the song is too long for this game when you are checked.)\n\n____\n\nAll in all, always remember this.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you had a bad start (As in wrong/bad positioning or you already lost two units two minutes in.). You can always make a comback. Using your pieces correctly you will always have some kind of way to fight back against the enemy's offense or either increase the defense of your King. If you ever find an opening, even a small one, you have a chance. If a risk is what it takes to turn the game over, you might as well take the risk because you already have a chance of losing the match. If the match is completely unwinnable, stall the game at least for up to two turns. Sometimes it takes two turns for a blindspot in the enemy's defense to appear. (Most of what is said before this most likely does not apply if it is end-game and you only have some pawns left and they're not close to being upgraded.)\n\nIf the enemy is smarter than yourself, don't be intimidated or discouraged (Unless of course your opponent is a game master.). Every human being each have their own seperate chances of making mistakes, which are reduced over time. But it is impossible to have a 0.0% of a chance to never make a mistake. If your enemy makes a small mistake in positioning, if you punish them for it then it'll change that small mistake into a big one. Giving you a slightly better chance of winning.\n\nIn short, never give up and surrender. If you're a serious chess player, you should know that there are multiple ways to do certain things and also get out of situations. You should only surrender if there is no way to win at all in the next four to eight turns.\n\n____\n\nChess is not a simple game.","September 12, 2015","true","4.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Also, -1 for losing connection, it seems.\n- 2 points for loss.\nI don't see an 18 point difference in a check/stalemate, nor do I see the reason to use the "forfeit" system. If anything, that should be less than leaving. Losing should not cost anything, considering it's pretty admirable that someone getting their ♥♥♥ kicked stays for the entire game instead of just hitting "leave".\n\n- In multiplayer, THE BOARD IS SHOWN FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PLAYER 1, FOR BOTH TEAMS! They claimed they fixed this, but I still encounter it. Nothing more disorienting than playing chess upside down. It's such a simple fix, too.\n\n- 3D models aren't particularly recognizable.\n\n- Some infrequent connection problems.\n\n- The in-game "chat" button sends you into Steam direct-messaging with the other user. Even if it's optionally enabled, there should be an in-game chat bar.\n\n- Some sounds aren't normalized. RIP headphone users who get put in check.\n\n- Ads in the free version: five second ads before rounds start. I'd hate to see this "freemium games" trope introduced on Steam.\n\n\nOVERALL:\n\nIt's Chess. How could you ♥♥♥♥ it up? With technical problems, advertisements, and an unrefined rank system, apparently. Considering it IS free, I would reccommend this game as soon as the rank system is tweaked.","March 1","false","11.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","2"

It's name says it all: simply chess. That means no explosions, no mods, no skins, no variation of factions. It's just chess, pure and simple.

They have multiplayer both local and online. They have a compter with a difficulty scale. Then have a little variation in the chessboards and pieces. That's all you need.

I am by no means a chess genius so AI level 6 seems to be about my skill level. I notice the AI has a few quirks at this level. It doesn't seem to grasp the concept that the king can defend itself in a limited fashion. It thinks it has me beat by putting it's queen next to my king. King takes queen.\n\nIt's also very protective of it's pieces. For example if there's ever a situation where it could take my rook by sacrificing a bishop it will never take my rook, even if it would put it in a better position strategically speaking. This basically allows me to control the board by purposefully putting my pieces in dangerous sitations forcing it to back off. It probably doesn't act this way at higher levels.\n\nOther than that, it's chess and it's free. There's probably a million others out there just like it but this is the first that's made it to Steam.","September 16, 2015","true","23.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Plays great so far, with only a few minimal bugs/crashes, but the developers are working as quickly as they can to improve the game/add suggestions.  There is an Upgrade to Premium option for $5.00 which removes ads, but I have really only seen ads in Single Player play against the CPU. Online Play hasn't giving me ads yet.\n\nIts been really fun playing against other Steam users in the past few games I've played. This is a welcome treat to Steam.  Looks like this is the closest we will get to having the old Steam Parlor games from the olden days of Steam. Now all we need is a Checkers game and maybe Tic Tac Toe!\n\nReally nice chess game, looking forward to the many improvements to come!

Let me explain why:\n1. Online mode's timer\nOnline mode have timer yes, but its completely useless since timing choices going like 1 min/per move and 10 min/per move, why didnt you put 2 min 3 min etc. too? Come on, 10 min/per move match lasts 9 times more than 1 min/per move its an abyss.\nWorse than that, you cant see your timer whilst playing in-game! You need to get some telephone timer and check, its stupid af.\nAlso this game doesnt have fischer timer clock which is extremely stupid too, maybe I want to play like just 5-45 min short match and by game's system its impossible, because you can wait 1 min for every move, so even if you playing with shortest time mode game might be take 2 hours.\nI noticed that you cant use timer while playing with AI.\n2. AI system\nI used stockfish to develop for chess tournaments, and I know that its strong af, but come on I am 1700 elo player and I doubt if level 10 AI did mistake while playing with me, game finished draw and then I played once more time, at that game he made an obvious mistake, and I won easily, I am trying to say that its unbalanced and even can level 10 AI go crazy sometimes.\n3. Music\nI am %100 sure that I heard main music on another game at Kongregate, I am not trying to say gamemakers stole that but they could have used some original music for game.\nIn-game musics are also stupid, I know I can mute that but it had negative effect when I played for first time.\n4. Boards\nEven Chessmaster(which is an old game) have some cool graphics and boards, but this game not very much board option, bad graphics and you have to check them by playing a game(no inspect mode).\nI have noticed that much thing in only 1 hour, this game is really awkward trust me.","September 12, 2015","false","0.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

First one is the timer, I lost a game because it said I was out of time while simultaneously showing that I did indeed have a couple of seconds left, which frustrated me greatly, because I was far away from losing and already had a move in mind and was only a click away from making it which takes less than 3 seconds. Second point is it can be pretty confusing when you are playing as blacks in 3D mode as the blacks appear on the far side of the board. I would like it to be flexible, so that if you are playing as black, black pieces would be on the close side of the board.","December 14, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The "simply" moniker is paramount here as many chess or chess-inspired games have shown themselves to Steam before but none have seemed to get it quite right. This one does. Play against a scalable AI, an opponent in your home or against friends or random players online. Simply chess simply works, which at this point of video game chess seems to be a major accomplishment of it's own.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI've noticed a lot of people complaining about this game. Mostly because of the ad. Yes there is an ad that runs for 5 seconds before you play a match. If you pay 5$ it goes away. For some reason this seems to really irritate people. One 5sec ad seems to be driving people mad. Well the game is completely free so I personally think complaining about the ad is probably being a little bit spoiled.

Avoid, avoid, avoid! You want free chess? There's several different things you can get instead of this. This is one of the worst implementations of chess I've tried. To the developer: if you have to release yet another chess program, at least make yours stand out. This one has nothing. It doesn't look very good, it has awful AI, it doesn't have normal chess clocks (fixed time per move instead), it glitches, and there are some serious very basic problems with it. Let's name a few shall we?\n\n* It puzzles me how the AI levels were implemented for single player game. Both on level 1 and level 100 difficulty, the opponents makes moves like he was a monkey and picked the random one available. It places pieces on squares where they can be captured and in general plays terribly. For reasons I can't comprehend, it is stronger for example on level 45 difficulty, but don't expect fireworks.\n* I started 2 online games and both times the board was flipped the other way. My pieces were on the top. I had white and I was moving pawns downwards. That's the weirdest thing ever... I searched for a button to flip the board to actually view it from the perspective of my pieces and I didn't find it.\n* Music glitches at random moments starting to make a repeated choking noise like a stuck gramophone.\n* If you lose internet connection, even while playing single player, you'll be bugged by some cryptic error messages covering your scren\n\nOn top of all these problems, it keeps annoying players with advertisements.\n\nWhy would you want to play it? Other than to farm cards or perhaps gain achievements if you're an achievement hunter. And also... Why would anyone give this positive reviews? In the field of free chess, this one is a step backwards. Not only other existing chess programs and services are better and more professional, but also they are actually free and don't annoy you with ads every time you start a new game. If this game was another genre, it wouldn't have any positive reviews, because people would just say "this is just a terrible rip-off of XXX, very poorly done". Here suddenly some people have mercy, and say it's good to have a free chess game, perhaps because they don't know any better.\n\nIf you love chess though, I recommend lichess.org for example. Everything there is free, more professional, there are flexible time controls and many very useful tools that can help you get better. And this one? It's just rubbish.","September 23, 2015","false","0.0"," 92 of 121 people (76%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","76","92","121","13","1"

Definitely needs some polishing.\n\nEdit 2: Disclaimer: Since the game is free to play, I'm not attempting to disuade people. The developer seems to at least be interested in bug-fixing. This review is based on my experience pre-patches.\n\n~~\nAs a chess fan, this isn't bad. Had a single match vs a level 1 opponent and it went well. If this is was a project someone put together, it's pretty decent.\n\nFor a free to play game, I can't say much.\n\nThe quality of the music is terrible. The music broke about 5 minutes into the match anyway so it wasn't missed.\n\nThe game logic is standard as per other chess games. Didn't notice any problems and the computer player predicted most of my moves on level 1. A minor feature that bothered me was the lack of dragging pieces. Clicking worked fine though.\n\nOverall, it did what it was supposed to. However, the reason I'm not giving this a recommendation is there are much better options elsewhere.

While the attempted targeted military assault on an enemy head of state may sound like a brutal, bloody premise, it should be mentioned that the graphics have been toned down to a degree that lets you easily forget that this game is basically about two armies trying to obliterate each other.\n\nSound:\nThere's sound. If you like classical music, you'll like the sound here. Because it's classical music. Also, no dying screams of the lowly soldiers whose hopes, dreams and future are thrown away to enable the continued decadence of their ruling class, so that's a plus. Or not, if you're actually into that sorta thing, you creepy, disturbed human being...\n\nCharacters:\nThe units in the game each have unique... I guess we could call it special moves. Or just moves. Let's go with directional capabilities.\nYeah, the unit types all move differently. In terms of balance, the game does a good job of evening the playing field between the two sides, even if White tends to have a systematic advantage, getting a headstart in the default mode (which one may change if one is so inclined).\nOther than that the factions in the game are not all that different from each other - a stroke of genius that supposedly aims to make the player think how both sides in a war are usually just staffed by poor schmucks who get to suffer the consequences of their respective leaders' poor life decisions.\nThe game has strong RPG elements, such as upgradeable units (pawns can level up to become queens if the requirements are met) and... yeah, no - that's it.\nI'm sure that, given enough time, the developers will get the hang of balancing the various units in the game - as of now, queens are hopelessly OP and just waiting for a nerf.\n\nDifficulty:\nThe single-player AI can be adjusted from "disinterested cat randomly trying to push pieces off the table" to "knows how to play chess much better than I do" up to "dear Kasparov, how are there still so many difficulty levels above my skill-level".\n\nVerdict:\nIt's still chess. On Steam.\nAnd it eats up like, a few hundred megs of disc space only - go get it already.","April 28","true","7.0"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","100","16","16","13","0"

Simply chess. Chess, probably the greatest board game of all time, with no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, just chess. It has pawns and ♥♥♥♥, even ♥♥♥♥ing knights! It's brilliant. So, if you like chess, download this ♥♥♥♥. If you don't like chess, what the hell are you doing here? If you think you might like chess, grab this from steam, its worth it and here's why.\n\nEven if you have no idea how to chess this game is worth it. Rules and moves can easily be looked up in the game, there are a hundred skill levels for playing against the computer, so no matter how good or bad you are, you can have a fair match.\n\nEverything is very basic and simple, which I consider good. You can either have a 2D view of the board, or a nice classic 3D chess set.\n\nThe singlebest thing about this game though is the multiplayer. The only thing I don't like about chess is that pretty much nobody else I know likes it. Now this is a problem of the past. No longer do I have to nag people to play chess with me in real life.\n\nAs far as I could tell from the couple of hours I've played there is a decent amount of opponents to be found in multiplayer and if not, it's easy to organize a game between steamfriends. The only thing this game could have done better is the chatsystem for multiplayer. It would be nice to be able to talk to your opponent in the game itself without opening the steam overlay.\n\nThe best thing about this game though is that it is free! Yes, that's right!!! That means you don't have to play any money!!!! It's so ♥♥♥♥ing incredible I'm not even ashamed of my use of multiple exlamation marks!!!!!

There's a lot of people playing online, so it's easy to get a game started.\n+ The developer is active with the community and is fixing the bugs.\n\nNegative\n- The game is lacking polish and has a few minor bugs. (I've reported these on the forum)\n- The game displays adverts before games, but these adverts are only about five seconds. They are not annoying/flashing/etc - they are just static images of other games by the developer. This is a very minor negative and is easily outweighed by the game being free.\n- The AI-25 achievement is very grindy. Experts (not me!) who could beat the high levels would have to intentionally play lower levels to get this. A better idea would be achievements like "Beat at least level 20" etc.\n- There's no click-and-drag method to move pieces.\n\nOverall it is great that we now have a free chess game on Steam, which is in a playable state. There are bugs and negatives points, but these are minor.","September 15, 2015","true","36.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","11"

And it always moves quickly, which is huge plus.\nPlus, being a steam game, you have the overlay and some\nreasonable confidence you're not gonna get virused.  Play\nreally is free except for 6 second ads so of the time.  ALMOST\nno vs. AI bugs!  So far, I had exactly one time out of  about 7000\nmoves that it got stuck and wouldn't move; and rven then, by no\nmeans a full lockup or crash, I was able to quit the game to the\nmain menu no problem.)\n\nOnline play is pretty terrible.  First time I tried, no games\nshowed up until I got bored and quit.   Second time, my\nopponent never moved, I won by default only 3 minutes\nafter the clock ran out, and then it didn't give me credit.\nThird try, posted a game with a 1 minute limit, waiting\nso long I'm bored and writing this review.  (Probably\n15 or 20 minutes waiting now.)\n\nWorse yet, online, darnn thing doesn't seem to have an approrpiate\nchess clock.   Chess is supposed to be that you have so\nmuch time PER GAME, not per turn like you in this version.\n\nPer turn is stupid.  (But not a problem vs AI.  Against AI,\ntake as long as you want, and then it moves quickly.  Very\nnice.)\n\nBut online, per turn clock (instead of proper per-game clock\nmeans you either pick a long time limit, and might have\nto wait way too long for early moves and end-games\nwhere there might just be 4 or 5 piece left on the board.\nPick a short time limit, it might not be enough for the mid-game,\nwhen you need to think things through.\n\nDefault time limit seem to be days, or sometihng like that.\nHardly reasonable.\n\nSo, if you're a very "casual" player, it's a good game for vs.\nAI.  Try to see if you beat each of all 100 levels.   If you're a\ngood serious player, well, this game is probably overpriced at\nfree.","March 21","true","138.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But, for a chess game, it does what it says on the tin.","September 19, 2015","true","2.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's chess, plain and simple, plus the fact that it's free makes it better. The fact that it has steamworks is another huge plus.\n\nThat said, the game does have some issues. The biggest one is the lack of an actual resign button, meaning that if a player wishes to quit, they have to go AFK until the timer (7 days by default, but can be altered) runs out . There are also weird glitches that pop up all over, but the developers are very active on the forums and have been issuing patches daily. The worst glitch currently is that if you win by the other person running out of time, it doesn't actually log as a victory.\n\nProblems aside though, having a mostly well-made, Steamworks enabled, and free Chess game is very nice. I'm sure the bugs will be sorted out. Also, the people whining about ads are dumb, IT'S A FREE GAME. Being free lets this have a larger playerbase than it probably would have gotten and the ads aren't even bad. Also you can pay 5 bucks to remove them.\n\nEDIT: They have indeed added a resign button.

Simply Chess is a must-have.\nChess is my all time favorite boardgame. I've played it since grade school.\n\nWhen I saw a F2P version of it on Steam, I had to try it out. I'm pleasantly surprised.\n\nThere's a ranked online matching system that uses ELO to determine opponents. If you don't want to play online and instead want to hone up on your gambits or sweeps, you can take the AI for a spin (the AI has a multitude of difficulty levels).\n\nWhat I really like though is the amalgamation of the game. The simplicity of the classic chess board and pieces, blended with a decent game engine and relaxing classical music, provide for a very calming yet mentally stimulating experience.\n\nI feel that a firm grasp on Chess will also provide one with carry over skills that can greatly benefit your life. It helps with memory retention, projection, strategizing, critical thinking, twitch/quick thinking, opponent/competitive psychology, sportsmanship and focus.\n\nI definitely recommend this game and playing it at least 45mins-1hr a day (whether on Steam, or in person with an actual chess board). Add it on top of a physical exercise regimine and you will be on your way to being a highly improved and efficient human being. :D\n\nGr8 Game checkm8 i r8 8/8","September 23, 2015","true","1.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There's no interesting challenge modes or anything so don't expect anything fancy from it (Though it would be a nice twist if something of the sort was added). There is a play by turn, where you can make a move  in a game with your friend and wait for them to take their turn. There's also Local/Online multiplayer, if you're feeling competative. And of course the Vs Computer for those who hate playing against humans.\n\nChess alone is not the biggest deal in games as many of us know, but if you prefer a simple board game here on steam, this I recommend, even if it only entertains for a little while.\n\nI personally might play a match or so a day, so if you happen to see me on, feel free to invite me :3","September 20, 2015","true","1.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

They sound pleseant enough, though.\n- Game queing and lobby system is functional.\n- UI isn't bad. Pieces are easy to move.\n\nCONS:\n- The rank system:\n* You can earn points to get placed with equally matched opponents. The problem is the point distribution:\n20 Points for Checkmate, but only 2 points for Stalemate (THE ♥♥♥♥?)\n-19 points for forfeiting, -1 points for leaving. They make NO DIFFERENCE. Also, -1 for losing connection, it seems.\n- 2 points for loss.\nI don't see an 18 point difference in a check/stalemate, nor do I see the reason to use the "forfeit" system. If anything, that should be less than leaving. Losing should not cost anything, considering it's pretty admirable that someone getting their ♥♥♥ kicked stays for the entire game instead of just hitting "leave".\n\n- In multiplayer, THE BOARD IS SHOWN FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PLAYER 1, FOR BOTH TEAMS! They claimed they fixed this, but I still encounter it. Nothing more disorienting than playing chess upside down. It's such a simple fix, too.\n\n- 3D models aren't particularly recognizable.\n\n- Some infrequent connection problems.\n\n- The in-game "chat" button sends you into Steam direct-messaging with the other user. Even if it's optionally enabled, there should be an in-game chat bar.\n\n- Some sounds aren't normalized. RIP headphone users who get put in check.\n\n- Ads in the free version: five second ads before rounds start. I'd hate to see this "freemium games" trope introduced on Steam.\n\n\nOVERALL:\n\nIt's Chess. How could you ♥♥♥♥ it up? With technical problems, advertisements, and an unrefined rank system, apparently. Considering it IS free, I would reccommend this game as soon as the rank system is tweaked.","March 1","false","11.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","2"

As in, more serious one, not the dot and cross thing. Merida, Pirouetti, etc.\nYour chat button is almost out of the screen in fullscreen.\nI don't think your chat works.\nI understand that the rules of chess have the "Once you lift a piece you have to move it" rule but computer versions of this usually do not have such a rule as you never know when your mouse will start to glitch and suddenly click on a piece.\n\nIn terms of style:\nThe font is too overdone.\nIt may be just me but, the steel look around my profile is not nice (maybe something simpler or nothing at all)\nIn my opinion, a modern look of chess would be great, no need to remind us about how old this game is.

I understand this is first attempt to make a chess game on steam but still needs a lot of polish and fixes.\n\nFinding a online opponent is almost impossible as there are mostly private rooms and players who invited each-other. (I've only managed to find a 1 player and the game was terribly long)\n\nComputer is very weak, I've beaten lvl 100 and I'm very very amateur player.\n\nWhen you play black you can't flip the board and you have to view the pieces from top which is hilarious (imagine playing real chess like that).\n\nI wish good luck to the developers, fix all the bugs and hopefully this game will be more recognized and be playable.

It is nice idea, Steam is great place for Chess to develop even more (in terms of playerbase), especially since many of players here are casual ones. But this game seems laggy (chess, really?!), it has troubles to even load, there are many features missing.. Honestly, takes too much effort to even get started, interface is awful, and I won't even mention ads.. All in all, nice idea, it is bound to be succsessful, if executed in the right manner, so I really hope devs will refine this whole thing and make chess popular on Steam (from the looks of it, they are really trying to work out all of our suggestions so props to them!), but as of now, I would skip it, wait for couple of updates, cause simply put, there are a lot of free chess websites out there that offer more pleasant and more detailed chess experience.\n\nI remain hopeful this will get updated and reworked into great game in the near future!\n\nPS- I really like the amount of AI difficulty levels; great thing for brining new players in!","December 14, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Plays great so far, with only a few minimal bugs/crashes, but the developers are working as quickly as they can to improve the game/add suggestions.  There is an Upgrade to Premium option for $5.00 which removes ads, but I have really only seen ads in Single Player play against the CPU. Online Play hasn't giving me ads yet.\n\nIts been really fun playing against other Steam users in the past few games I've played. This is a welcome treat to Steam.

Now all we need is a Checkers game and maybe Tic Tac Toe!\n\nReally nice chess game, looking forward to the many improvements to come! A Must Play game for any Steam user who likes Chess.","September 13, 2015","true","11.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","1"

Let me explain why:\n1. Online mode's timer\nOnline mode have timer yes, but its completely useless since timing choices going like 1 min/per move and 10 min/per move, why didnt you put 2 min 3 min etc. too? Come on, 10 min/per move match lasts 9 times more than 1 min/per move its an abyss.\nWorse than that, you cant see your timer whilst playing in-game! You need to get some telephone timer and check, its stupid af.\nAlso this game doesnt have fischer timer clock which is extremely stupid too, maybe I want to play like just 5-45 min short match and by game's system its impossible, because you can wait 1 min for every move, so even if you playing with shortest time mode game might be take 2 hours.\nI noticed that you cant use timer while playing with AI.\n2. AI system\nI used stockfish to develop for chess tournaments, and I know that its strong af, but come on I am 1700 elo player and I doubt if level 10 AI did mistake while playing with me, game finished draw and then I played once more time, at that game he made an obvious mistake, and I won easily, I am trying to say that its unbalanced and even can level 10 AI go crazy sometimes.\n3. Music\nI am %100 sure that I heard main music on another game at Kongregate, I am not trying to say gamemakers stole that but they could have used some original music for game.\nIn-game musics are also stupid, I know I can mute that but it had negative effect when I played for first time.\n4. Boards\nEven Chessmaster(which is an old game) have some cool graphics and boards, but this game not very much board option, bad graphics and you have to check them by playing a game(no inspect mode).\nI have noticed that much thing in only 1 hour, this game is really awkward trust me.","September 12, 2015","false","0.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

If you want chess, this is chess, and there's not really anything to complain about in that regard.\n\nThis also gets a reward for some of the worst music I've heard in a video game. Please turn off the music if you're gonna play Simpso- I mean Simply Chess. damn... :(\n\nEDIT: I know that my review is invalid because I'm only complaining about the aesthetic portion of the game and misheard somebody, but it was my honest reaction to the game. Again, it is functional virtual, simple chess. For that I'll even recommend it.","May 6","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"

I was looking for a simple chess programm without any fancy graphics just in a 2D style or with the option to turn the 3D animations and all that stuff off - just a basic and intuitive game with a good AI for offline games and maybe the option for a decent multiplayer. It also works alright with the Steam controller, which is nice - so all in all I am happy.","May 13","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
