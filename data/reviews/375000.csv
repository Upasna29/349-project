You have RPG aspects to upgrade your skills, you get boosts to stats with skill points, and it has a complete weapon and accessory system like an RPG with the colored levels and whatnot. Special skills, secondary weapons, XP and tech pickups, and quite a few non-upgradable stats that are boosted by the equipment you find and buy.  (shield regen, crit. %, pickup distance, etc.).\n\nYou pick up weapon parts, shields, and modules to give yourself different stats and it is kind of randomized like a Diablo/Borderlands as it says on the  store page. It's defintiely NOT an adventure RPG game, its a SHMUP, but it has that style of item value so there isn't much other way to describe it. White, green, blue, purple...yadda yadda. xD\n\nMusic and the backgrounds aren't great. You can dim the backgrounds though so it makes it a lot easier to see enemies and stuff through bullets and the background graphics. Sounds, music, and backgrounds make it feel Indie and it does make the presentation feel a little less than amazing.  Options to force V-sync, change resolution, and a few other video options like changing to windowed and landscape. Audio is standard volume so you can shut the music off if you want. I think that the gameplay and mechanics are solid enough to recommend this, however. Watch the store video if this is a major issue for you.\n\nIt also has the option to turn on auto-fire so your main weapon fires constantly. This is actually pretty much what I use because you wouldn't stop firing in this game regardless. No reason to bother turning it off imo. You also have a speed up button to skirt out of tight spots much faster.\n\nIt's not a AAA made SHMUP by any stretch, but defintiely has a lot of great qualities that aren't common in this genre. Getting it from a bundle I am pleasantly surprised, and the low price isn't something I'd cry about if I had bought it either.\n\nThe gamepad controls are OK, but not great until you rebind them. Initially, before you are able to rebind them they feel very awkward trying to move around the menus (they actually do work in the menus, but may not seem like it the way they are bound). They do become easier to use once you figure out how to bind them and that the cursor is being moved by the left stick, or D-Pad. Trigger buttons, are not available to bind, at least on my PS3 gamepad using 360 emulation, but the shoulder buttons work fine. There aren't enough controls to worry about this, however. Unless you turn off auto-fire the only other in-game buttons you need are "Special" and "Speed Up/Boost" So you don't need the triggers anyways. Once you bind them everything works fine and you don't need to worry too much. You are dodging a TON bullets (bullet hell obviously) and picking up loot so not worrying about firing is nice. :P\n\nFun scrolling arcade bullet hell that has Campaign, and arcade modes. Leaderboards, achievements, and trading cards. Presentation isn't amazing, but the mechanics and gameplay are fun and worthwhile. Has some difficulty spikes that might need some balancing, but I didn't have too many issues.\n\nAwesome emtoes too. :icarussmile:","August 8, 2015","true","4.3"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","21","22","2","1"

Although the description references Diablo and Borderlands it is actually a very standard (length wise) 5 levels top-down shooter with Rpg mechanics mixed in. You level up, get some loot and allocate points in skill trees with the usual critical strike, armor, shield and such stats you would find in a typical Diablo-like. So while it's not the big adventure you might expect, there is some interesting theorycrafting to be made.\n\nPros\n\nSuper smooth framerate\nGood variety of loot and stats\nWeapons feel great\nYou get a massive regenerating shield which is a relief when tons of bullets are fired your way\nControls fine with a gamepad\nPretty cool music\n\nCons\n\nThe backgrounds are really minimalist and repetitive\nSome bosses are op, some are jokes, could use some balancing\nGamepad in menus controls the mouse cursor, might as well use the mouse?\n\nAll in all I'd recommend it, just don't expect a full blown RPG but rather a small top-down shooter with Rpg mechanics.","June 27, 2015","true","6.2"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","1"

Even in scrolling shooters, a branching skills tree could perhaps be labelled uncommon if hardly new, but I've not seen many looting system within the genre. Games like Borderlands and Diablo are liberally name-dropped as comparison models, and not completely unfairly. Either by defeating enemies and picking up drops or purchasing from the in-game store, you can deck out up to four equipment slots including primary and secondary fire, as well as a core chip and a shield.\n\nIt all works pretty well; though physically thereâ€™s not a huge amount of variation. For example, the primary fire is purely distinguished by the rate of spread, the more focused the collection of bullets, the more powerful they usually are. Secondary fire has a little more choice to it, offering homing missiles or a collection of lasers with a small variety of tricks ranging from vanilla constant beams to a circling weapon that rotates constantly around your craft. Things like armour rating, shield power, tech drop rates, critical hit percentage and power consumption are also tracked through your equipment making any alteration you go for more of a balance trade off rather than a straight swap. That new laser might be more powerful, but it does chip away and your shield regeneration rate and make your hitbox slightly bigger.\n\nFull Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12600/pc/icarus-x-tides-of-fire/review.html\n","July 4, 2015","true","8.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Developer "Quadsphere" has made a casual mode for scrubs like me to practice on before I graduate to the three higher difficulties.\n\nWhat sets this game apart from your average schmup is the ability to collect tech as you play.  Unlike your typical game which gives you a short boost, these upgrades are permanent and may be better than your  existing shields, weapons, and missiles.  If so, you can switch them out at the end of each level.  If you're playing casual difficulty, you can also switch gear if you die before the level is finished.  Any of your items can be sold for cash if desired and there is a cash shop available to purchase additional items.\n\nYou accumulate experience points to level up and build the type of ship you want -- Attack/crit, defense/armor/resists, or tech/special weapons.  For example, you can increase the damage of your weapons, increase your crit chance, add armor or increase the amount of tech you receive.\n\nMy only complaint with the game is the items in the cash shop are usually low quality weapons  aside from maybe one of two items that may not have the weapons or stats you need.  In addition, the items in the shop do not change until you complete a level.  This can be a problem if you're stuck on a tough level with weak equipment both on your ship and in the shop.\n\nMy tips?\nDecide on your preferred playstyle (Attack, Defense, or Tech) in advance.\nPick the ship that matches your playstyle best.\nInvest at least 21 skill points for your playstyle to get the maximum buff.\nAlways max Bullet Resistance with skill points regardless of playstyle\nTry to buff up Tech Find with your equipment to keep a steady stream of gear flowing.\nRotating lasers suck.","October 13, 2015","true","13.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Some elegant RPG progression elements needed to advanced past challenging (but not impossible shmup-like) levels has kept me coming back for more. A decent varity of common and boss enemies, weapons, shields and powers gives this little game a good amount of depth.

When I play level 1 it runs about half speed (compared to the video on the store page). But level 2 runs too fast! (Improved somewhat by forcing V-Sync on in the options, but leaving me unsure what speed it's supposed to go at - If I have a 70hz display is that going to make the game run faster than on 60hz??)\n\nBalancing is all over the place - I was making it through level 2 fairly easily, until one shot from the boss killed me outright from something like full health + 1/4 shield - and it didn't even look like a big attack, just a small yellow homing bullet.\n\nThe shield getting smaller and making it easier to dodge as it takes damage isn't a bad idea, but if a single hit can knock off my shield and kill me in one go (even though the bullet would have been miles off hitting me if I didn't have a shield), that's just annoying.\n\nNormal enemies on level 3 seemed far too tough to be fun, and none of the weapons in the shop were significant upgrades so I stopped there.\n\nAlso, the joypad support on menus is pretty rubbish - you have to drive the mouse pointer around (without even analog input)","July 4, 2015","false","0.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
