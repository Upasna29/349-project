"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexngregory/recommended/312780/","alexngregory","alex.n.gregory","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexngregory/","3023 products in account","Let's just get this out of the way first. If you think Way of the Samurai 4 is a serious samurai game, you're carving up the wrong tree.\n\nAcquire/XSEED Games' 2011 third-person action adventure (ported here by Ghostlight Games, who have done a stellar job addressing a number of bugs and deficiencies in the original release) balances a deep exploration of post-isolationist Japan... with BDSM torture minigames and supporting characters like "Melinda Megamelons" and "Jet Jenkins".\n\nThe story is fairly straightforward. You (a wandering samurai) arrive at the Amihama Harbor just as a conflict is breaking out between British emissaries, the local shogunate and a band of nationalistic rebels. After an initial tutorial and understanding of the various factions involved in this conflict, you have free reign to do what you want. You can choose to ally with one or more of these factions, carry out side missions for characters or simply say "screw it" and train up for the local fighting tournament on the third day. Even though there is a timer involved, the game clock is fairly slow and you'll almost always run into one or more plot events that advance the story.\n\nThe best way I can describe this game is Grand Theft Auto-meets-Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes. While there isn't a huge area to explore (there are a handful of different districts in the city, along with a couple of forest areas and caves), you can pretty much do anything you want. Take on jobs for certain NPCs, rob shopkeepers, double-cross factions at certain points, farm for money to upgrade your weapon, enlist people for your dojo, get arrested and tortured, go "nightcrawling" (ask women out on dates, then try to seduce/wrestle them) or anything in-between.\n\nAs far as the impact of the story goes, know that first and foremost, you won't see the majority of content in one, two or even five playthroughs. This is a game that requires you to complete it many times over, whether for unlockable items and costumes (obtained by points that are given out after each playthrough is done) or to see certain variations of plot events that can only be "triggered" by playing the storyline in a certain order.\n\nIn fact, unlocking most of the endings either requires you to use a guide or have extreme patience, as some events aren't even accessible unless certain buildings are functioning a certain way and you know enough to go against the beaten path to do things you might not otherwise expect.\n\nI admit that there were parts of this game that are genuinely heartwarming, such as the Flames of Prajna ending (where you side with the mercenaries against an inevitable truth) or the interactions with some of the side characters. It's a game that definitely wears its heart on its sleeve, and balances moments of lighter or absurd humor with a complicated plot that allows each faction to be thoroughly explored and understood.\n\nI'll be the first to tell you that I have very limited experience with the series, having only played the original back on the Playstation 2 in the mid 00s. WotS4 definitely lives up to the premise and plot of that game, though it doesn't have quite the same "open world" feeling. Regardless, there's still a massive number of things to see and do, and it can be almost overwhelming for new players.\n\nThe weapon and style customization options are also back in full force. You can upgrade and hone your weapons to deal more damage or not break as quickly. I quickly found myself maxing out one of the "Black Mark't" swords you get for completing a side mission in a certain way, and using that to chainsaw through enemies for a good number of future playthroughs.\n\nThe combat might also be a "make it or break it" situation for some people. You can't always go into battle and expect to mindlessly slash at people, especially on higher difficulties. Enemy encounters often require you to master parrying, block and effective use of your special meter, which allows you to execute whirlwind-like attacks against blocks of enemies. While I found that simply spamming my forward thrust attack was enough to get me by on the lowest difficulties, it was downright infuriating when I cranked up the difficulty and found myself getting schooled by high-level enemies who melted my defense (and sword durability) down.\n\nAs far as the port itself goes, Ghostlight did a great job soliciting feedback from the community and scrubbing out a number of major bugs and graphical issues. I was part of the beta testing team for the game, and saw just how polished it became by release. Ghostlight's always had a knack for producing high-quality ports, and this is no exception.\n\nWill you like this game? If you can past the somewhat absurd tonal shifts and the chore of doing multiple playthroughs to see all the endings, there's a wealth of content to discover and play through. The customization and character interaction will also keep you coming back for more. This is definitely worth a look for the price, and so far, it's my favorite PC port this year.","July 23, 2015","true","24.6"," 540 of 569 people (95%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","95","540","569","30","15"

Do you like spaghetti westerns?  How about having sex with women?  This game has all of this and the ability to make your own SUPERIOR JAPANESE STEEL WEAPON and eat steamed buns straight off the ground.\n\nWay of the Samurai's a weird beast of a 3D action game -- it's kind of threading the needle between the open-world nature of something like Grand Theft Auto or Just Cause, the clear territorial restrictions and boxing-in you might feel with a more standard JRPG like The World Ends With You or your average Final Fantasy-type game, and the complex, unforgiving combat of Bushido Blade.  The other reviews are right, you're presented with a lot of decisions that can alter the flow of the story, but Way of the Samurai 4, in a departure from those other games and indeed other entrants in its own series, has one really nice mechanic that helps make all of this open-world nonsense a little bit easier to parse:  An event log.\n\nMost of the time, if you're making a decision, you don't really know what the ramifications of that decision might be, and it's often difficult to figure out if you've made a decision that brings you to a section of the plot that you actually want to see, or if you're about to be tossed into a pit of boiling oil for having the audacity to win a swordsmanship tournament.  Spoilers, sure, but you probably don't want this to happen to you and I guarantee you'll be disappointed when it does.\n\nWay of the Samurai 4, thankfully, has a helpful event log that lets you know that yes, you have the choice to participate in other events that have opened up to you based on a decision that you have made, and kindly lets you know when you're supposed to do that.  While a lot of people disdain this level of hand-holding in a game whose primary feature is meant to be exploration, I find it refreshing and am willing to admit that as I get older, I don't have time to play through a game six or seven times before I can even get to the main meat of a plot that I might actually want to experience instead of being forced into my own sad, unavoidable doom.\n\nThis game's good.  It's not 50 dollars good.  It might not even be 25 dollars good, if you're the type of pearl-clutching reactionary who needs every game released on steam in 2015 to have 60fps graphics -- even ones that originally came out in 2011 -- but it's definitely good at the price it's at now, and if you're patient, it's a clear pickup for a steam sale that puts it at even 15 dollars.  It's cheap, it's a stable port, it's got really good combat, and you can wear weird flower-covered robes and not have other people discriminate against your sexual tastes.  What's not to like?","July 24, 2015","true","0.5"," 195 of 219 people (89%) found this review helpful 71 people found this review funny","89","195","219","71","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theclovis/recommended/312780/","theclovis","Clive Enduro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theclovis/","233 products in account","Disclaimer: Way of the Samurai 4 is capped at 30fps due to engine limitations.\n\nWay of the Samurai 4 is a very unique game where you play as a wandering ronin set in Japan, circa 1855. Unlike most games that claim "Your choices matter!", Way of the Samurai 4 actually delivers on that promise. The story, while short enough to be completed in under 4 hours, is determined completely by the player's actions. One playthrough is likely to be radically different from the next, as each choice made not only determines the characters fought alongside, but the very path the story takes. Don't like what a particular character has to say? Interrupt the dialogue and speak your mind, or even draw your sword and attack! This, like everything else, can and likely will change the path the story takes.\n\nAs for combat, Way of the Samurai 4 does a few things worse than its precessors, such as the removal of the Heat mechanic and One Hit Kill mode, but makes up for it with a myriad of refinements to the combat system, including a separation of styles from swords. With the new system, you can use any style with any sword, effectively allowing the player to completely change their moveset on the fly. Taking that even farther, the new "My Style" system allows players to create their own custom style comprised of any moves they've already learned from the pre-made styles, including secret "special moves". Adding to this is the new Spring Harvest mode, which allows for the player for temporarily cancel any move instantly into any other move, creating ridiculous combo potential.\n\nReturning is the Push and Pull system, where defense revolves around exactly what the name implies. If an enemy uses an advancing move, the player can "pull" back while blocking to knock them off balance, or "push" forward against a neutral enemy attack to parry them. There is more depth to this system than what I've just described, but that would be an entire article in itself.\n\nCustomization is extremely robust, with almost every single NPC face (which includes voice), body, and clothing set unlockable for use, and several other generic articles of clothing obtainable. Swords can be disassembled for parts and crafted using any combination (emphasis on any) of blade, guard, and grip. Even crazy abominations like a nodachi blade with a claymore guard and knife grip are possible. Like stated before, the player can even create their own custom moveset and use it with any blade they wish. Weapons have multiple stats, including Strength, Durability, and Charm type, with the former two being upgradable.\n\nThe game does have a few issues, however. The aformentioned charms on weapons are entirely RNG-reliant to obtain and can be a large hassle for players looking for "the perfect weapon", though getting a "good" weapon is by no means a grind. The game itself is a port of a PS3 game, and while an excellent port, it shows. Some arguably muddy visuals and clunky menus might drag down the experience a bit for those who demand more, but (as of this post) the game has been priced accordingly. ($25 USD at full price on launch)\n\nPerformance is excellent, with great frame delivery that results in virtually no framedrops or stutter whatsoever. This flawless performance peresists even at 4K resolution on a mid-end (GTX760) card. At 720 or 1080p, it runs great even on toasters. Arbitrary resolutions are supported: if the desired resolution isn't present in-game, a custom resolution can be entered in the .ini file. Controls are fully remappable for both controller and keyboard, with mouse support available in menus.\n\nOverall, Way of the Samurai 4 has a ton of content and a ludicrous amount of replayablity. The localization is spot-on and the voice acting is well done. For those wondering, no, the game has not been censored in any way. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking to play a Samurai game on PC, or is just looking for a content-rich sandbox to play around in.\n\nPersonal note: I highly recommend anyone new to Way of the Samurai 4 to NOT use a guide.","July 23, 2015","true","123.1"," 98 of 118 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","98","118","5","6"

A mix of spaghetti-western and samurais, this craft your own adventure keeps you coming back for more via the multiple styles of combat, the various types of decisions you have to make, and the multiple different endings. For $20, this was a purchase I don't regret for a second.\n\nSince my initial review they have added keyboard/mouse optimization which has improved it significantly. I still personally prefer a controller, but one is no longer required.\n\nMy rating: 4.5 out of 5\n\n╩╩╦╩╦╦╩╦╩╩╦╩╦ Long Version ╦╩╦╩╩╦╩╦╦╩╦╩╩\nPros:\nMultiple different fighting styles; between swords, spears, and hand to hand/unarmed combat, the vast amount of different fighting styles can keep you experimenting for days, eventually leading you to crafting your own unique style (which you can share amongst your own dojo!)\n\nCraft your own story; in every sense of the word, the decisions you make in the game ultimately craft out how the story unfolds. Want to be a heartless, xenophobic samurai who only uses his fists? YOU CAN!\n\nWell done port; it's a big surprise in the market nowadays when a port from a console game actually works well. This is probably the most pain-free console port I've played to date. I've had zero graphical issues, no problems with the interface, FPS isn't stuck at some ungodly low number that makes the game skip around.\nNeutral:\nYou need a controller to play the game; the mouse/keyboard is so dreadfully awful that you really shouldn't even bother trying. Even with switching around the bindings to suit your needs, it's just painful. Grab a cheap wired 360 controller (or equivalent) if you don't already have one just to save yourself the frustration.\n\nLack of graphical options; while the port is extremely well done, there is a very limited number of settings you can adjust when it comes to the graphics. I'd be a bit cautious if you were just below the minimum requirements simply due to the lack of adjustable features. Updated: They've added a few adjustable settings to fiddle around with; I have not messed with them much, but its a welcome addition.\nCons:\nThe torturing "mini-games"; this is just a personal issue, but I found something about these games slightly unsettling and unnecessary. Not so much the concept of them, I just feel like the game itself could have done so many different things than a torture mini-game. It feels like a short-sighted decision on making something "edgy".\n╩╩╦╩╦╦╩╦╩╩╦╩╦ Conclusion ╦╩╦╩╩╦╩╦╦╩╦╩╩\nI'm extremely happy that they've brought one of the WotS series to the PC, and it has set a wonderful benchmark for the rest. While each playthrough may take between 45 minutes and 2 hours (maybe longer if you choose), the vast amount of options add an insane amount of depth and replay value to the game.\n\nThere are some short comings with the game itself, but that is all a matter of personal opinion. I found a few of the fighting styles to be a bit clunky (and some downright worthless), but it doesn't take away from the core game itself.\n\nFor newcomers, I recommend starting on Easy just to get comfortable with the game. Plus, you'll unlock more weapons/styles/accessories/etc for your next playthrough.\n\nI hope you found this review useful.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/312780/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","Acquire's previous Steam release had gamers defeating vampires, by beating them up with action figures, and then ripping off their clothes. Way of the Samurai 4 isn't quite as weird, but veterans and newcomers alike will be surprised, by just how strange the life of a Ronin can be. I've enjoyed this series for quite a long time, and I'm happy to see one of the better titles now available on the service.\n\nAs with previous entries, WOTS4 has some basis in historical fact. In the mid 19th century, through treaties and other cooperative efforts, the formerly isolationist Japan worked towards becoming a world power. Due to some questionable decisions by the Shogunate, the country went through something of a semi-colonial period. The British, among other Western powers, held territory in a handful of Japanese ports, where they enjoyed legal immunity.  There was also a rise in xenophobia during this brief yet tumultous period.\n\nIt is in these times that you, the wanderer, will find yourself. Will you be the hero that leads Japan to a new age? Will you be their downfall? Maybe you won't be much of anything? Why sacrifice yourself for the greater good, when so many immediate pleasures await? How you answer all these question determines your role as a Samurai. This is the main appeal of the series, the ability to not only make important decisions, but to also interact with a small yet very detailed world.\n\nIn this entry there are 10 endings. How you achieve those endings is determined mostly by your dealings with three factions. By participating in events, time will progress, and eventually your fate will be binded with the people you support. Before long, you'll get a feel for how everything works, and future play-throughs will go by very quickly. Way of the Samurai games tend to be short, especially if you know what you're doing. If you want to get the most out of your adventure, you'll want to participate in a lot of extra-curricular activities.\n\nRemember what I said earlier? About "finding yourself"? I meant that in every sense of the word. One of the more enjoyable aspects of the series is creating your ideal Samurai. This can be everything from the clothes you wear, to the weapon(s) you wield, to accessories, hair, face, skin-color, etc. Most of the customization options have to be unlocked, which is a joy to some and a bane to others. Regardless, with enough imagination you can create the look that suits you. How you play games can also have an affect on your days as a Samurai. Dishonorable Samurai tend to make poor decisions, disrespect the dead, and choose violence over diplomacy. This will affect your ranking at the end of every game.\n\nWhile there are over a hundred weapons, and you'll feel inclined to collect them all, the best one is going to be crafted. For perfectionists, this process is equal parts rewarding and infuriating. Aside from the huge investment of cash, you also have to consider charms. These rarities can be found on every weapon part, and unlocking their potential involves a heap of luck. Still, it's something to consider. For example, if you manage to create a sword with three Life & Death charms, you'll never have to worry about eating during battle to keep your stamina up. Since recovering HP requires stamina, you can see where I'm going with this. A weapon is nothing without a style, and you'll either find or design one that suits you. The style determines not only the moveset, but also special abilities like higher defense. Styles are found off the corpses of your enemies, and must be trained through combat to unlock their full potential. Alternatively, you can find scrolls that perform the same effect.\n\nWhether it's through achievements or simply discovering the mystery behind all of the "???????" in the unlock menu, you may find yourself bound to complete everything in Way of the Samurai 4. This is as far from a trivial task as anyone could imagine. Let's consider the night-crawler portion. During your adventure, you can attempt to gain the interest of the women you pass by. Depending on the time of day, using a line such as "My ship docks at your harbor tonight." can actually work. The following night involves everything from stealth elements to a wrestling match. After all that, you're treated to a love-making segment that's almost as comical as the ones you'd find in Bioware games. This fun little excursion can become a soul-destroying process, if you're crazy enough to take on the "100 night-crawls" achievement.\n\nAs the hours pile up, you'll discover that Way of the Samurai 4 takes great joy in making completionists suffer; bedding 100 virtual women is just the tip of the iceberg. While finding the moveset that is perfect for you is entertaining, unlocking the hundreds of moves necessary for a slew of achievements is anything but. Expect to become intimate with the casino, as that is where skill-unlocking scrolls can be purchased. Several clothes and accessories are hidden behind some incredibly obscure unique night-crawls. While everything you need to know can be found on GameFAQs, the process will likely remind you of playing un-translated Japanese games. In short, exercise restraint as much as possible while playing this game. If something ceases to become entertaining, just stop and do something else.\n\nMore than anything, Way of the Samurai 4 is what you make of it. This game will draw you in with its allure of being the only Samurai Simulator out there. You will discovers many ways to indulge your innumerable desires. Whether it's the accumulation of wealth, the honor of a high-ranking title, or mere bloodlust, you'll always have something to do. Along the way, you'll stumble into some bizarre situations (such as torturous run-ins with a trio of sadistic sisters), and appreciate the game's many other quirks. This is a unique adventure, one in which you'll want to try everything, and it is extremely addictive. Check it out sometime.","August 1, 2015","true","44.3"," 50 of 53 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","50","53","2","2"

Sure, why not\n- Do you want to be a hero, a savior of Japan? Go ahead\n- Do you want to be a master Samurai, with your own Dojo and ♥♥♥♥? Fine, let's do this\n- Maybe you want to be an assassin, killing people with no reason?

You do so by helping one of the factions fighting for their ideals or spreading chaos as best you can.\nThe port has its issues (mainly sound distortion which appears randomly and a 30 FPS lock which is not very noticeable though.

But it makes up for that by being incredibly fun, rewarding and replayable.\n\nIt has 10 different endings, with various branching story paths leading up to them. It has humour by the bucketloads (though I personally think they pushed the humour a bit too far compared with the previous games). It has a ton of weapons to collect. It has numerous "styles" which provide you with different moves to use in combat. It has a large amount of minigames and side quests, the latter of which have some really creative ideas implemented (e.g. pretend to be the murderer of a young woman's parents, and fake your death to make her happy). It has tons of replayability, allowing you to carry over your items and weapons to a new game and try to achieve a different ending.\n\nAll in all, I'd highly recommend it.

A good game that has suffered (then mostly recovered) from console import issues.” (8/10)\n\nPros:\n- Fun and challenging combat – easy to learn the basics, difficult to master, not a button masher for the most part\n- Short but well written, branching storylines\n- Player actions/choices matter\n- Plot twists!!! (Again, player choices actually matter.)\n- Massive replay value\n\nCons:\n- Issues as an console import – includes occasional audio and graphics bugs, random game freezes/crashes, keyboard controls are cumbersome at best (glitches have improved drasticly after patches)\n- Bootstrap method (money --> upgrade weapons --> harder quests --> more money --> repeat) character progression required during early hours of gameplay\n- “Choices Matter” mechanic can be unforgiving at times, requires a “save early, save often, and in different slots” approach.\n- Later fights may be a bit too difficult/hardcore for casual players (player vs. 25 mobs just as strong as them), even when playing on “Easy” mode.\n\nOverall, Way of the Samurai 4 has been a terrific game for me.  Fun but challenging gameplay has been paired with great characterization and fantastic storytelling, to present a game that virtually has it all.  The branching plot lines are easy to follow thanks to the Event calendar, but pack surprise twists as your every action can affect the plot…  This game certainly deserves the “Choices Matter” tag.  In my case, I accidently killed the pharmacist NPC during a street brawl, only to find out he was needed for a later story event (and a scene reminding you he had been killed was included as part of the quest!).  There is so much to do that it is quite impossible to accomplish everything in a single play-through, and the game has been designed as such, having the bulk of your inventory and consequences for some of your actions carry over to the next save.  As a result, WotS4 also benefits from immense replay value.","August 5, 2015","true","83.2"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","23","24","2","0"

The price is not unreasonable and if you get it on a sale it's absolutely worth it. While I understand the frustration of the players complainig about the DLC not being included, even though it was promised, however I would say that even without the DLC it's worth the buy.\nThere some visual bugs (wich the devs seem to be trying to fix) and the graphics are indeed not very good, but they aren't that bad that you'll fell grossed out by them.\nMy major frustrations with the game are: - Lack of Evolution In The Series. Since Way of the Samurai 2 the game has changed very little in the way of content and extention. It's still a very simillar game. Considering the life span and console progression we should at least see a bigger map, but that didn't happen. If you liked the previous ones you will very likely like this one too, but also won't find anything surprising either. What the previous games did right are here, on the other hand what they didn't should also still be. The changes made were minor enough that preference over any game on the series really comes down to taste and the tuning of each system. By now this game should have already found the footing of these systems and moved on the greater things (expanding the map, more interactions, longer story, prettier graphics, more factions, etc). Also the story here feels similar as well (mostly to the WotS2) where you have Yakuza/Thugs (in this case the Prajnas, similar to the Aoto gang) versus Government (tries to maintain the peace but is riddled with corrupt characters, coming across as cruel sometimes), so even in storyline the evolution is a very slow.\n- Lack of Mouse Support. Honestly it doesn't bother me that bad. The game is, without a doubt, playable, even with no gamepad. It's not really convenient or comfortable however. The devs do seem to be working to implement support ASAP so this shouldn't remain a problem anymore.\n- The Decision to Lock Down Some Areas Further in The Game. This basically makes some quests you pick up along the way useless, but the game doesn't tell you that the area is locked down (so you have to know when this happens and keep track of it yourself), so it seems a little schizophrenic when it gives you a quest in the magistrates office, lets you accept said quest and, when you get there, it's impossible to get in, even though the game will mark the spot you have to go to in the minimap.\n","July 25, 2015","true","68.8"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","25","28","3","0"

I've heard a lot of people say something to the extent of "It's like GTA in fuedal Japan!"...which isn't quite accurate.\n\nThe game IS open world, and it does have quite a few things you can do in it, but about the only real similarity here is the open world part.\nThe story isn't anything amazing, and the game is pretty short, but the fact that your decisions and actions (or even inactions) will have a big impact on the story is a big plus. This also affects the ending you will get, as there are several different ones.\nFail to protect someone during a fight? No, the game's not over, but that character is now dead. You will go on.\n\nIt also has a pretty quirky (and at times perverse) sense of humor that reminds me of some of the old Japanese samurai drama/comedy shows. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and clearly doesn't expect you to either.\n\nThe game isn't without it's faults though, and many of them are pretty easy to see. The AI isn't the most brilliant. People in town will walk around, bump into each other frequently, and either apologize or end up picking a fight.\nThe scripted scenes at times look like everyone's waiting for the "slower" character to realize he's supposed to say something. Animations aren't always the best, and the graphics, while they do the job, aren't exactly stunning. There's also the shortness. It took me just over 2 hours to beat the game on my first play-through. (Though I focused pretty heavily on the main story, and didn't do many sidequests.)\n\nThere's a lot of good though, that really overpowers the faults. The game is actually fun. The corny humor is refreshing, and there's plenty of things to do in the game.\nThe sword fighting system is quite nice, and responsive. On easy mode button mashing might get you through most things, but on higher difficulties you'll need to be more careful. I also love the variety of skills, weapon upgrades/mods, fighting stances, and so on that you can use.\nThe number of endings and different ways of playing mean that even though the game is short, it has a pretty good amount of replay value.\n\nOverall:\n\nPros:\n-Fun Gameplay\n-Quirky humor\n-You can be a naked samurai with an afro, and mustache, and nobody cares.\n-Replay Value\n-Your choices direct the story\n-Lots of character, weapon, and fighting style customization options.\n-You can try to pick up women and get rejected, just like in real life!\n-The old blacksmith looks like an asian Duke Nukem.\n-At $25, it's pretty inexpensive.\n\nCons:\n-Rather Short\n-Graphics reveal it's a PS3 port.\n-Oddball glitches here and there (though they're more funny than harmful.)\n-Cut scenes are pretty robotic, though entertaining.\n-Kinda stupid AI.\n\nOverall I'd give it a 7.5/10, mostly from sheer fun value.\nWould be a naked samurai getting rejected by old ladies again.\n","August 12, 2015","true","9.0"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","19","20","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yoj/recommended/312780/","yoj","Yoj","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yoj/","209 products in account","Way of the Samurai 4 is a game where a visual novel meets an action-packed samurai flick. It's really hard to categorize. You have an extensively branching plot and non-linear events from a visual novel on one hand, and elaborate combat, upgrading, crafting systems along with an open game world on the other. It's a rare and unique experience one should try themselves.\n\nWay of the Samurai 4 is set in a post-isolationist Japan, with the country being more and more influenced by the foreigners, with some of the natives being ok with it and some of them - not so much. The stage is set in Amihama city, and you have 5 days to become part of the events and resolve the struggle in one way or the other. So how do you change the fate of Japan in just 5 days? By taking part in story-based and side-missions of course! The game has huge replay value, as almost every mission has different endings, and completing them will unlock something new in the game world or the story. Your event progress and opportunities are conveniently illustrated by a built-in flowchart, so you'll never miss anything.\n\nSo, how extensive is the story branching? You have three main routes with ending variations and an independent samurai route, which makes for 10 different endings combined. Like in a good movie, every branch and ending gives you a piece of a bigger picture of the events in Amihama. So it's not like a regular game which you beat once and put on the shelf — it's meant to be cleared multiple times in different ways. This is where having a story span of only five days comes in handy.\n\nTo make things more interesting, the results of your actions are transferred between playthroughs, as are your belongings, skills and the in-game flowchart. You've managed to convince the smithy's apprentice to return to his trade and succeed as the town's blacksmith? He'll be there working as a blacksmith in your next playthrough. You've been too aggressive in the town, acting as a bandit? Don't be surprised to find more patrols, as a response to the increased crime-rate. There are also other, more subtle changes.\n\nWith all the dialogues and decisions, this is still an action, combat-centered game. The combat system features multiple weapons, skills, stances and styles, but there's more to it: you have the ability to craft new weapons and improve existing ones, you can also fight melee or even switch to non-lethal moves (Kojima's Seal of Approval), you can even create your own unique fighting styles! So it's easy for those who just picked the game up, and sophisticated enough to give something fresh to seasoned players.\n\nNow, technical side of the things. Way of the Samurai 4 is a port of a niche PS3 game back from 2012, which wasn't AAA even back then. Some things were ported as is and were not improved from PS3:\n\n- 30 FPS lock;\n- Game world is divided in lots of rather small locations;\n- Texture resolution left as is. Game has nice visual style, though;\n- Save system still has limited amount of slots;\n\nThe default keyboard controls were made by scattering actions all over the keyboard. The problem shows itself when it occurs to you that you either need to move your hand from WASD / the mouse to do something, or grow a spare hand. The mouse support is ok, but still, using a gamepad is highly recommended.\n\nDespite every port-related problem and keyboard controls, this is a fun game to play and a unique experience that you probably won't find anywhere else. Most people have missed this gem, both upon its original PS3 release and this PC port, with SteamSpy estimating sales at less than 50K copies. Don't be like them! Amihama city awaits you for a samurai showdown.\n\nP.S.

The phrase "your choice matters" is not exaggerately cause in the extreme case you can hit a gameover because one wrong choice (happened to me in my first playthrough lol). You can also interact with people in the middle of cutscene like talking to another person, draw your sword, or even tell a funny joke and people will react accordingly too.\n\nThe game is also tracking your progress through the storyline based on your actions in which will affect your overall score and title at the end of the game. Be a samurai-like good guy and do things like : avoiding crime, not killing innocent people, choose a wise decision; to get highest score possible and in return get a lot of samurai points (used to unlock many features).\n\nBut the main appeal of this game is the fact that there are hundred of movestyles with difference stances like Chu-dan (often said Seigan no Kamae/mid-ready position), shinobi (ninja, yeah cool), dual arms, and more. To be honest just when I mastered a certain movestyle and thought "This must be the best movestyle in this game", I found a better movestyle later so I ended up trying almost all movestyles I got and never get boring. And what's more you can create your own movestyle with your prefered stances and moves you already mastered so there are a lot of combinations to try. Each movestyle can also has up to 3 stances.\n\nThere are also a few cons from this game and mostly due to a poor porting from console, but none of them are to the point of game breaking. This include lack of graphic settings (there are only brightness and resolution seriously), fps locked to 30, bad button mapping for controller (unless you have 360 controller, you have to find a workaround).\n\nBut overall I find this game very enjoyable, having spend so many hours and still not bored yet. So for anyone who has interest in samurai, swordmandship, or fan of this kind of "choice matters" game, will find this game enjoyable too.","December 12, 2015","true","142.2"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","69","27","39","12","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OddballEddie/recommended/312780/","OddballEddie","Grifon Eddie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OddballEddie/","549 products in account","I believe it's fair to say first that I've been a fan of the series since the original game on the PS2 so I'm a little biased. Before writing this review I have beated the game twice. Also I added a TL;DR at the end.\n\nWay of the Samurai 4 is still at heart an open-world (Still limited to a city but open to explore) action game with some light RPG elements, you're let loose in the town of Amihama which then you make your owns choices as to how you're going to proceed in town, right at the tutorial you'll realize the town is torn between 3 factions which you can ally yourself to them or not so much there are options hidden in it's story. This is an aspect of the game which is interesting you're given freedom to make your choices said choices will ultimately affect the ending and give you some insight of the plot in different perspectives. It's not the best written story but it's not bad either.\nThe tone of the game's story isn't very serious some characters are obviously evil on the border of being cartoonish and some activities such as the nightcrawling missions are quite silly.\n\nVisually the game is simply not pretty, I'd say it's a high-res PS2 or very early PS3 looking game it goes to show that the game was either made on a very tight budget or in a short ammount of time if not both, for those looking for something pretty to look at you won't find it here. I've also experienced minor graphical bugs, nothing game breaking but usually smoke effects and other transparencies haven't been meshing with the background so well, this is mostly on cut-scenes so it didn't get in the way of the fights.\n\nAction is good enough, the gameplay system seems to mix of a lot of elements of all previous games it seems very messy at first and the tutorials don't give all the information required to fully understand. You have two attack button a light and a heavy slash with some combos or moves mixing the buttons while pushing forward, back or while defending. You can parry attacks, use command throws, learn new moves, craft new weapons or upgrade the ones dropped by your enemies, health is handdled differently, instead of just having an HP bar you also have a vitality bar, this acts like a reserve for HP which you fill by eating food and it'll regenarate your health once you're out of battle or defending, it's strange at first but this gives an extra incentive to go to the restaurants or even to use food in battle (Just try to get some distance first).\nYou'll have access to 3 main types of weapons, swords, spears and fists, you can upgrade your fighting style by ... well, staying alive and killing people but also each weapon has different styles with different moves, most are just minor variants of a stance but they do give some diversity despite that not all styles seem to be very useful. You also have to keep track of your weapon durability since swords and spears can break, you can repair it using items or paying the blacksmith. Also you can change between 3 equipped weapons at once and even reversing the sharp side of the blade so you don't kill your oponents (Some missions require you to keep them alive)\n\nSound design is ok, the soundtrack is still good, not as remarkable as previous soundtracks by Noriyuki Asakura (His work on the Tenchu series was better) but it'll still set the mood for some feudal Japan samurai action.\n\nThe game has quite a lot to do, since it keeps track between plays it'll record just about everything you do and grade you when you either die or finish the game, it's not very long but since the game has 10 different endings there's plenty of reason to start fresh, most of your items carry over between sessions, once you start collecting and upgrading your weapons, you can start the game again with a better sword making the early part of the game much easier. There are also plenty of side-quests to either make money or that'll give you access to new things such as the ability to speak English with foreigners (Which includes flerting with the ladies), there's so much to do that in just in two playthrus I already got 12 hours out of it and didn't get much.\n\nConsidering this was ported from the PS3 to PC, it has been running smoothly from day one, with just a few weird but minor sound and visual bugs but no crashes, although the game is locked in 30fps it didn't feel like it got in the way so much, I'd say it's a perfectly functional port.\n\nTL;DR: If you like adventure games with some ocasionally challenging fights and good replayability, this game should suit your needs, if you're looking for a visually impressive game or a narrative masterpiece this isn't it. So far the game has me hooked just like WotS 1 and 2 there is still a lot to find and experiment.","July 25, 2015","true","69.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

As such, I'm thrilled to have Way of the Samurai 4 on Steam.  Being a big fan of the older games, I'm admittedly predisposed to liking this, and the game so far seems to be a good continuation and expansion of what the series has offered in the past.\n\nBranching storyline with multiple endings?  Check\nHuge array of weapons to collect?  Check\nWarring factions to assist or impede Yojimbo-style?  Check\nHuge replayability factor?  Check\n\nThere seem to be a large number of character customization options to unlock this time as well, which is a welcome addition.  The weapon customizaton options seem nice as well, and I like that movesets are now tied to collectible "styles" instead of to the weapons themselves.\n\nIf you are a fan of earlier games in the series and have never played this game, picking it up should be a no-brainer.  If you've never played the series before, there are no barriers to entry here.  It's not like you have to know lore from previous games or anything like that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/recommended/312780/","deathbomb1","Dirk Dickbutt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/","389 products in account","I would like to go ahead and say that, while my PC version only has about thirty minutes on it, I have more than fifty hours in the console baby version of this game.\nWay of the Samurai is a series that just kind of stuck with me every since I played the first one back in my younger days at the tender age of 53. I feel like I have a lot of common with the Ronin of old on account that we're both homeless and fight people for swords.\n\nYou play as a wandering Samurai, one that you customize with name, face, and clothing before sending him out into the world. After taking a boat ride to the port town of Amihama seven years after the foreign black ships showed up, demanding that the Japanese inhabitants buy their hats.\nOnce you get off the boat, your master-less Samurai is swept into conflict between the Pro-Shogunate government an the nationalist isolationists. It's up to you to decide whether you also want a funny hat or putting up “Keep out” signs wherever you go.\n\nThe game itself is a third person action game with a few RPG elements. You're free to go around town and find your own things to do like find side quests, fight random encounters, or scrounge for rice balls to eat like the miserable sack of crap you are. You can collect and take apart swords from fallen enemies, and even have a smith build your very own sword with the parts you collected from the dead, increasing it's stats over the course of your play through.\n\nWhen in battle, you have a few moves at your disposal to make sure you don't end up like a background character from an old Akira Kurosawa movie. You have your standard attack, dodge, block, and parry. But what sets WOTS apart from other sword fighting games is the fact that you can change your fighting style with the use of books that enemies sometimes drop. These new martial arts, unless they're for spear or fist fighting, are usable with any sword and changes both your Samurai's stance and attack patterns completely. It's a neat thing that keeps combat interesting, finding a art that suits you instead of sticking to the default stance and attacks.\n\nThe story is...Strange, and that's coming from a garbage eater like me. The story revolves around a conflict between the pro-government forces and the anti-foreigner movement: The Prajna. The background itself wouldn't be all that strange if it wasn't for all of the strange characters. I don't know if it was the localization team or the director of the game itself, but WOTS4 is fairly sillier compared to the other games in the series. And that includes the one with the cowboy samurai.\n\nThe game is short, but that's kind of the point. It takes place over the course of four days with a different ending depending on your actions. I think there was 14 or 20 or so endings all together. So there's fun in finding all the ends. Or just saying “Screw it” and leaving the island via boat all together.\nHey man, I'm not judging.\n\nIt kind of takes you out of the experience when you're talking to someone with the last name “Megamelons” as well as one of the love interests being a girl who's name is “Laura Rita” but pronounced “Laura Lita” by the Japanese voice actors.\n\nGet it.\nLaura Lita.\nAs in Lolita.\nHa\nHahaha\nOh that's dirty.\n\nBut it's not like the characters are unlikable, I mean Jet Jenkins got my vote on his name alone. But it seems to be only the white devils that have all these strange names, since the Natives to Amihara island seem to have traditional Japanese names. Unless there's a joke in their native language that I don't understand.\nBecause I am a white devil.\nI put Mayo on everything and eat Sushi with forks.\n\n“But Dirk, you future king of the world.” You inquire. “What's the difference between the PS3 version and the PC version?”\n\nYou never asked that, I'm sorry for making assumptions.\n\nWell, there's the usual. It runs better and it's noticeably smoother to it's console counter part. But there's actually a feature missing that kind of disappointed me.\nIn the PS3 version of this game, there was a feature called Tsujigiri, or Cross-roads killing in English. What this feature was was a Dark Souls like element where other player's characters to show up in your game. They could be super powerful or weaker than you, and if you managed to kill them you would be able to take their sword as a prize, sometimes ending up with a sword much more powerful than the one you had with you. It wasn't another player, mind you, just their character that you could hunt down or get jumped by while being out and about.\n\nSadly, this feature seems to be missing from the PC version of the game. It's not experience breaking by any means, but I thought it was neat to be just minding your own business about town before suddenly being shot in the face by Margaret Thatcher wearing knights armor and carrying a rifle.\n\nBut should you play Way of the Sword guy 4: The swordening?\n\n\nI personally enjoy the series. It's a nice departure from the usual way of story telling. But to be fair, it's kind of a departure from the series. If you like the premise of being a wandering Samurai looking for a purpose, but prefer a more serious story line and setting? I would recommend going with the 3rd game in the series that's not available on Steam. But if you don't care for stuff like that and just want to get into the series? Then WOTS4 is a good place to start.\n\nWay of the Gunguy 4 gets 3.5 Seven Samurai references out of 5.\n\nShoes were better when they had Velcro.\n\n\nThe curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation","April 25","true","0.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","12","14","8","1"

Plays kinda like Dead Rising, but with much worse game mechanics. The story is better in some ways... but you'd be mostly disappointed if story is what you want.\n\nBefore we begin, let's take a look at some screenshots of how broken the game can be:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=499680903\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=499681013\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=499680938\n\nPros:\n1. The game doesn't take itself too seriously and you can make very silly characters if you want.\n\n2. Customizing your own style/weapon can be fun... if you can get pass the ridiculous amount of grinding it will take (see Cons - point 5 & 6 below).\n\n3. The "True" ending is kinda nice... but it's not enough to save the game from it's bad designs/mechanics.\n\nCons:\n1. The game lacks a good tutorial. For example, the charm system of your weapons. What do they do? How to activate them? None of that is explained in game, ever. Go online to find out more!\n\n2. It's trying to have a "tactical" comabt system, whereas every action should be calculated, at least for higher difficulty when even regular mobs can one-hit-k.o you. However, there's no counter to grab moves (unless you have the "Pitching" charm). On the other hand, "just-in-time" blocks are very hard to achieve. Basically, since it's very risky to play "defensively," most players just play "offensively" - meshing guard-break combos (if you watch any "walktrhough" video online, that's how most players fight too). Does that sound fun to you? If you like meshing combos, maybe look into "musou" style games like Dynasty Warriors or Samurai Warriors, etc.\n\n3. Weapon degrades way too quickly, especially on harder diffculties. It's not uncommon to have your fully repaired weapon break in the middle of a long fight.\n\n4. In order to level up your skills/style, it take a long time to grind. And there are many styles to learn. And don't forget your weapon will degrade during fights.\n\n5. Did I mentioned there are many styles to learn? The style drops are random too - even from unique characters that appear once per playthrough. You finally fight against Sensei or Dojima, hoping to learn their kickass style... but they don't drop any (even after kicking their bodies to make sure). So you get into another playthrough again...\n\n6. Want to make your own weapon? Let me warn you first that you'd be playing slot machines, praying to gamblers' God that you could roll a good charm on rare weapon parts. Say you got a weapon you like - now you'd need to break it down for its weapon parts. However, the charms on the weapon parts are random. So you'd re-load a save hoping to get a good charm on at least one weapon part...\n\n7. The story and characters are quite cliche and "standard..." generally you can almost guess what's going to happen next in the plot. The only redemption would be the True End "(Light of Hope) path, but getting to that ending requires a lot of work.\n\n---\nTL;DR: if you don't mind a mostly bland story, funky combats and serious hours of grinding, then you may like this game. Otherwise, there are better games to play.","August 4, 2015","false","33.8"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","20","31","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rust_decay/recommended/312780/","rust_decay","raZe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rust_decay/","394 products in account","To anyone who has never played a Way of the Samurai game, it's best described as a mix between 3rd person action, open world and visual novel set in feudal Japan.\n\nThe core revolves around swordplay, but at the same time the game allows you to shape the storyline through your choices.  Several factions fight for power in the small town of Amihama and it's up to the player to decide whom to give an edge. Being a goody two-shoes is just as much of an option as aiding the bad guys or staying neutral. Simply sleeping the days away and thus skipping the majority of the game is also a viable option. It's entirely up to player.\n\nWhen it comes to combat, WotS4 is your standard hacky-slashy affair, which is somewhat disappointing. In the West, samurai and their way of life were popularized by movies like Seven Samurai, Sword of Doom, Harakiri or the Lone Wolf and Cub movies, which all lay emphasis on the importance of a single stroke. Duels were often decided after one cut following a huge build-up. Meanwhile in WotS4, there's no tension - you just whack away at your foes until they drop dead. However, the fights are enjoyable for the most part and the game does a decent job of depicting different styles and their use.\n\nSpeaking of styles: The game practically showers you with customization options and items. For a game that small, WotS4 is crammed with ways to spend your time and customize your character. You can upgrade weapons, learn new fighting styles, shop for clothes, change your hairstyle, go fishing, create your very own fighting style, run a dojo or chase after ladies. And that doesn't even cover all of it. But here's the downside: In order to get your desired items, you will have to grind yourself stupid. To acquire certain styles or weapons, you need to meet specified conditions. And even then, most of those items seem to drop randomly, so there's a whole lot of reloading and replaying ahead of you. And if you happen to finally get your desired style, there's still the business of unlocking new moves by leveling it up. In order to max one style, you will have to kill 500 enemies at the very least. In case of weapons, upgrading them to the point of being actually useful will rob you of your lifetime as well since enemies tend to be damage sponges. Upgrades cost money and become progressively expensive up until a certain point where money doesn't cut it anymore. Then you have to farm for materials as well in order to upgrade weapons beyond the upgrade threshold. Depending on what you want and how hard you pursue it, WotS4 will keep you busy for dozens of hours. The question is if you will still be entertained at that point.\n\nThe game is rather short and can be completed within a few hours, minutes even, but it's impossible to see everything during your first playthrough. It's obviously designed with multiple playthroughs in mind and somewhat appealing in its approach, provided you can stomach some anime goofiness. To give you a taste: There's a character in the game called "Melinda Megamelons". While not particularly well-written, each new story branch adds another twist to the storyline you have experienced so far. It's like the videogame equivalent to Groundhog Day.\n\nThe Way of the Samurai series has always been rather unique in its approach and this one's no different. It's probably the most polished and most content-rich entry in the series yet, but it will take you a lot of time to customize your character to your liking. Experiencing new story branches should usually be enough to keep you playing. If you're a fan of chanbara, you will certainly get your kicks provided you don't expect something too serious.","July 30, 2015","true","29.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Macabre_gothhumorgamez/recommended/312780/","Macabre_gothhumorgamez","Macabre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Macabre_gothhumorgamez/","204 products in account","The second game in about 10 years to make it to my favorite list.\n\nThis game has ton of depth to it , many side quests, hidden events, collectables, replayability, multiple endings, and multiple stories. There is a lot to this game and if you want to see and do everything it can take a very long time. I’m over 90 hours and only about half done doing everything. With that being said here are some facts to consider about the game.\n\n-Runs Great-\nVery stable while some people report issues in all the time I’ve played the game I've had zero issues the game runs flawlessly\n\n- New Game++X -\nwhile new game Plus is always a nice feature this game brings it a lot further, because of the way the game plays you literally cannot do or see everything in 1 go. the game is designed to be played over and over you can easily get over 10 replays from this game if not many more, and that’s not a bad thing, the game divides its story into 3 main factions. you can ally yourself with any of them or even none of them following different plays and stories for each of them, your choices also affect things allowing for even more differences. This means you can literally never even see the same things if you don’t want to. So instead of just getting stronger like some game+’s you can also experience new storylines and events. The best way I can explain this to you is you are 1 person in a town of many people you can only be in 1 place at any given time, while the game spans over 6 or so days depending what you do will determine what you happens so just because you in 1 area doesn’t mean things aren’t going on else where. This is why you can gave so many replays while still experiencing new things.\n\n-Unlocks & collectables-\nyour characters unlocked abilities, weapons, items, everything carries over between these. making you stronger, more versatile, and skilled as you advance. you also gain points when you beat a play though that can be used to unlock even more content from the games, from a guns license to use firearms to character accessories that change your appearance to harder difficulties, there is ton of unlocks from that system alone. not even taking into account all the other unlocks you will find through the game.\n\n\n-Detailed in-depth Combat System-\nThis brings me to combat the game starts you off pretty simple you can fight with a sword spear or unarmed, but you will soon find out there are other classes of combat like guns. Beside this there are literally over 100 styles to collect and master. So if you don’t like the way your sword is handling you can always try another style which will change all your abilities and moves. Eventually you can even create your own style taking all your favorite or most powerful skills and putting them into one type of combat.!\n\n-TONS of Weapons-\nWeapons are the same you can find, create and customize them from over 100+ weapons and over 300+ parts there are almost endless combinations you can use to make your own weapon. Weapons can also be made stronger to have better stats or re-forge or bless with special abilities further diversifying your equipment.\n\n-great UI-\n\nWith all the crazy amounts of content and things to do and unlock in this game it would be easy to be lost on figuring everything out, however, the games UI and record keeping makes it very easy to keep track of not only everything you’ve done so far but what you haven’t done, as well as giving hints at how to unlock or obtain thing you’ve missed.\n\nI could go on and on about the features of this game but my review would end up being a book the bottom line is there is a lot of options and way to customize your gameplay. This game is very in-depth and has a lot of elements to learn, even so I never find it daunting or tedious but rather exciting and fun to see what I can obtain or discover. The game itself also offer numerous others features from gambling in poker, to fishing, side quests, running your own dojo, to night crawling and many others. There are so many different thing you can do beside run through the storyline like a drone. For 25$ with incredible amount of content, amazing stability and such in-depth gameplay you cant go wrong. This game is  not for a casual gamer but anyone else it’s a must have.","August 8, 2015","true","98.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

(I also recognize after writing this that I wrote it in ridiculous order, but I don't feel like fleshing out a review for this game.  It's good, period).\n\nFirst off, if this game looks trashy to you, then yeah, it kind of is.  The graphics are sub par, it's in subtitles that make you wonder what took so long to port it, and you probably won't figure out how the game works without looking up stuff online.  But Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing Thunder Pants is it fun.\n\nThe game is about an hour long on an average playthrough, but you'll be playing through it many many times.  There are multiple endings, pathways, and you can pretty much pull a sword on anybody in conversation.  It reminds of westerado in fact, minus the changing culprit of the main murder.\n\nI should also mention this game typically doesn't take itself seriously.  If you've read other reviews, you probably know that the crime punishment system is an S&M-esque mini-game.  It's not really S&M, it just reminds you of it.  It's mainly deadly traps that would be at home on a saw movie if it had a new coat of blood.  And the other men act like the Gimp from pulp fiction when you try to escape.\n\nI usually find japanese stories lame, or at least japanese characterization.  The women are weak, the motivations are cheesy...but I think they did a good job here.  On one playthrough you think you'll have a character figured out, and then another playthrough shows a completely different side of them that you didn't know about, and yet it never feels out of character.  A leader might seem strong and resilient, but you later realize they are dangerously narrow-minded as well.  It's really well done, and I still find myself saying "Jesus, I didn't know they were like that."\n\nThe gameplay is just damn fun.  For such a constricted world of few areas and a short storyline, it feels like GTA.  Sometimes it feels like it gives you more freedom than GTA.  It even reminds me of Skyrim when I start a playthrough going "I'm gonna be good this time," then murdering a bunch of constables because I wanted to level up my sword style.\n\nSword styles man.  That's what probably makes the game.  There are something like 6 or 7 stances in the game, and each stance has 15 or so styles.  The styles sometimes have overlap with others in their stance, but they also have unique moves.  Some even have counter attacks, and one has a move where you simply walk forward without flinching.  When you hit h, you swing your sword at neck level for huge damage.  You collect styles from killing people, and you can also collect their swords (Better swords on harder modes).\n\nThe modes are very interesting.  Soon enough you'll be one hitting people on easy mode once you upgrade your sword enough at the smith (who you can also fight instead of pay.  Great way to upgrade your sword without spending money is not paying, running away, ending your playthrough at the harbor, and repeating).  Hard mode requires better swords and Harakiri mode requires some dodging and charms, and here's where we get into my gripes.\n\nI like charms.  They are passive effects on your sword that you can get from crafting your own swords.  Each sword part can have 3 charm passive effects, and a sword needs 3 of these effects to line up vertically or diagnolly in order to be a full working charm.  If you can get parts with two of the same charm, you can get it to line up in 3 different ways, tripling the charm, but therein lies the problem.  One, only a few of the charms are any good, and that is a waste of space and added frustration to my second gripe.  Getting good charm synergy is pretty much random.  Everytime you disassemble a sword, even if it's the same parts you've used 100 times before, the charms on those parts change.  What people do is get swords, disassemble them into parts, and hope they get a part with double charms.   If they don't, they craft the swords again with the same parts and repeat until they get a part with double charms.  Then they set that part aside and get a new one in it's place.  This is useless RNG (random number generator, drops such as world of warcraft) without any gameplay involved.  This will be a bit of a rant.\n\nEven though I play WoW, Borderlands and Diablo, I think RNG is useless in video games and serves only to add hours without fun in a game.  RNG can be done right, but rarely is.  And if you think there's any other way to get double charms, there isn't.  There's nothing special like killing the hardest character on harakiri mode gives a greater chance for a double big shot charm (one of the only good ones by the way).  They have no system in place.  They made disassembling a priority for getting charms, and it's boring.  It's one of those things where on a good day I'll turn away from the monitor and go "I just spent hours disassembling the same swords for a double big shot charm...Is that worth it?"  There is an alternative, which is repeatedly entering the buy menu from the smith to buy his parts.  Those change everytime you enter it.  While that seems faster, for some reason the smith has way more grip parts than any other parts, so once you get a double charm on your grip you have to try a lot more for a double charm on a blade or guard.  Whatever, it's all for triple charms which greatly help the game (perhaps too much?)\n\nAlso one last thing:  Parrying is useless and I find that unfortunate.  Parrying is fun in almost every videogame.  Have you ever parried someone in Dark Souls?  Getthe♥♥♥♥outofhereplease, it's the best.  It seems perfect for a samurai game, but as it stands there is no real system for it... not really with timing or anything.  Certain attacks just get parried easier than others.  There is this push and pull system, but it doesn't seem like pulling works better on pushing attacks than pulling attacks (btw, how many pulling attacks can there really be for a sword?)\n\nThe PC Port is great, minus a few things.  One, my lesser alienware computer can hardly run it, which is ridiculous because it looks like a ps2 game.  Two, no mouse.  Da ♥♥♥♥ is that about.  You play it like an arcade machine port.  No Mouse.  Boooo.  EDIT: They have added a mouse function\n\nStill, I'm waiting until relatives leave so I can play it again, cause jesus it's fun.  Highly recommend.","August 1, 2015","true","139.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

It is just I can tell if some lines from the completely Japanese voice cast are serious or not, it has it's comedy. To be a no name samurai during what is considered late Tokugawa era is one of the experience of going through a game story path that could end in a few hours. The game tells you that every choice you make effects how the story goes of good or bad, even by how short or long it ends. That is the beauty of how fast you can live or how slow you could die in a cut throat style or fulfilled role. The keyword here is replay-ability, in which is highly valued in a low budget yet high production game though item collection.\n\nRecommend using a controller for combat.","July 25, 2015","true","59.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

You play as a wandering murder-hobo (aka a ronin) who disambarks off a ship into a port town full of unreasonably-dressed warriors, numerous warring factions, and invincible animals... and I am not kidding about that last bit. You are encouraged to murder-hobo your way into the thick of things, nosily invading the political climate of the town and siding with one (or none) of the factions. You can side with the hilariously-goofy British Consulate, the tediously-boring Pranja Rebellion, the local town guardsmen, or you can sleep in for 4 days straight with no consequence, wake up and then slaughter everyone in a tournament. You can even start your own gym with one of the most proactive of recruiting practices I've ever seen, this side of a streetside preacher -- you beat the ever-living sh!t out of potential recruits, to which they will either accept your brutal teachings or kick you in the shins and walk away.\n\nThis game has a ton of fun things to do and it is meant to be played multiple times. However, for all that there is good about this game, there is some things that are bad.\n\nIf you have a serious problem with a 30 FPS game being offered and sold on Steam, best to leave this game alone as the comment section is full of subjective rants arguing about "objective truths." Here's the thing, this is a port from console to PC, and a lot of the game's mechanics are tied to a locked FPS. There is more technical details involved with this, but I'd encourage you to PM Ghostlight rather than troll through the discussion boards.\n\nAnother issue is that this game is a bit of a grind. Because you can play through multiple times, you are encouraged to use the last weapons you used/upgraded so as to improve them futher -- this is necessary on Hard difficulty and above. So yeah, the numerous charms required to make a fully-powered can be tought to get, depending on the weapon and weapon part involved.\n\nThe last major issue is the Day-One DLC. Here's the thing, none of it (except one, the Shinsengumi DLC) is required as all of the items therein can be found in-game. Its just that a majority of it is rare items and weapons, all of which can be found with their respective owners. Only the Shinsengumi DLC is encouraged to get, and its pretty cheap.\n\nIf you buy this game and don't like it, then ask for a refund. But if you give this game a chance, it might just surprise you.","July 30, 2015","true","22.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Bunch of people whining that they aren't given free DLC and the Devs didn't break the game physics and rewrite the entirety of the code so the game runs at 60 FPS.\n\nThis game is great, it's a really quirky faux-historical samurai game with a british ambassador that's a little girl, the most stereotypical evil government dude and picture boxes that steal your soul. It feels extremely smooth and plays well and aside from a few graphical kinks I haven't had any problem with it.\nThe keyboard controls are wonky as heck though, I recommend having some sort of controller simply to make your life easier.\n\nThe game is also short. I can do a playthrough in about an hour at most, but like a roguelike this game is meant to be played repeatedly. Explore, fight, and pick a side as you try and navigate your way through the streets of Amahara with lines drawn between the police, the xenophobic and the british while gathering students for your dojo, mastering your fighting style, making the perfect sword and engaging in sexy time.\nIt's an extremely charming and well put together game and definately worth the money.\n\nAs for the DLC, most of it is just early unlocks, the only stuff that's really important is the Shinsengumi, Where are they now and Ryoma packs and even then it's just two missions and some character options and weapons. The DLC is honestly not needed for a full experience and is just stuff to make your life easier or give you a few more pairs of pants to try on. At about $4 - $5 each, it's abit more then I'd expect for DLC for a port like this, but honestly I've paid more for TF2 Hats over the years and I really love the game so I'm happy to provide abit more support to the publishers.\n\nSpeaking of the Publishers, I do want to mention they had some controversy over censorship in Agarest 2. They've been fairly good at listening to those of us who didn't want this game censored and let us know every time we asked that everything was still in. That's a step in the right direction, in my book.\nIt makes me feel bad that they stepped into the storm with all these entitled people wanting all the DLC for free after they brought us this game.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, but it's really fun and worth adding to your steam collection in my book.\n8.5/10.","July 25, 2015","true","35.4"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

And, while they weren't all met, for every expectation not met they had a new aspect added in to make up for it.\n\nNow, for a brief "in-a-nutshell" rundown of what the seires has always been to start us off:\n\nPlay as a Samurai; Wander about a town/providence that's dealing with an internal conflict; Get one of multiple endings based on your choices.\n\nNow that you're caught up on the basics let me tell you some of that info about this entry to the series.\n\nWhen playing "Way of the Samurai 4" one of the first things you'll notice is that the game is HEAVILY story-based, as you watch a multi-part cut-scene that will take around 10 to 15 minutes (though, this is broken up by a tutorial on how to fight, which does keep you in the action). However, this introductory story segment does extremely well at introducing all of the main characters to the player. Allowing us to decide which groups we like, and which ones we don't, right off the bat (though, your perception of the groups will change over time). This, in turn will help you determine whom you wish to assist throughout the game, if any of them.\n\nThat's right, this story-based game allows you to completely bypass the story, and just do whatever you want to do. So, you can be a noble Samurai warrior, a renegade, a dojo master, or just a person who likes to fish (Though, let's face it, if you're playing a Samurai game, you're in it to kick some ♥♥♥).\n\nNow, a big difference in the story aspect of this entry to the series, is that the game provides you hints as to where you can go to progress the story, through the use of an "events" option in the pause menu. Whereas the older entries determined what happened to you, based off of where you were at different times of the day, which changed as you moved from area to area in the old games (though, in this entry, time is only passed by either witnessing a story event, or having your character sleep).\n\nPersonally, I think this change was for the better, as it allows the player to do a lot more, without the risk of missing an event they wanted to interact with.\n\nNow, onto the other main aspect of the game: "The Combat".\n\nCombat, in this game, is not as you would expect it to be (if you're starting the series from here). While a glance would make it look like it's a simple hack-n-slash action game, there's a fair amount of tactical thought that put into each strike (on any difficulty above easy). There are your standard quick and heavy strikes, as well as blocking and dodging, yes. But, there's also different aspects to each move, such as being a guard breaking strike, a push to knock your opponent off their guard, grabs, parrys that counteract pushing strikes (and much, much more!). When fighting in this game, messing up once against an opponent has the chance to mean instant death. So, you need to plan out what your going to do in real time, as you watch your opponent's movements carefully.\n\nThis kind of combat is much more engaging to the player, and makes every victory feel satisfying.\n\nNow...The controls do take a little bit to get used to, and are god aweful if you're playing on keybord (Due to this game being a port of a console game to PC). So, it's highly recommended that you play with an Xbox controller, if possible. I can't say much more about the controls, other than: "Pay attention to the tutorial".\n\nThis game is, in fact, a 30fps game. And, if you're a fps snob, then you're not going to like it. However, the game looks good, and isn't hindered by being at 30fps at all. So, if you're playing to enjoy games rather than frames, you're gonna like what you see.\n\nIn the end, this game isn't perfect, but it is a lot of fun. And I highly recommend it.\n\nFinal Score: 8/10","December 29, 2015","true","23.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

It has a presona-like system for story progression in which there are three times of day (morning, noon, night - don't be stupid) and participating in an "event" progresses to the next time of day. So there are various events available, each corrosponding to a faction within the game world, and you can participate in one per time slot. What events you choose to participate in and how you handle them determine the outcome of your story. This is a game that's very much about replaying many times to alter your story or see different outcomes - some of which can only be obtained by your learnings from previous playthroughs. There's a lot of love put into this game, tons of little details and fun surprises, and a lot to do. There are also about a billion different fighting styles, which are sort of fighting game-esque movesets with combos etc. Even some pretty unique, secret ones.

While Way of The Samurai 4 is a samurai-themed brawler at its core, there are several cool elements that help it to stand out from titles with similar mechanics.\n\nI'm gonna write a lot, so for people who don't care to read, here's a short list:\n\n+ Simple, effective dueling combat with a surprising layer of depth\n+ Absurd amounts of player agency and customization\n+ Lots of replayability\n+ Satisfying difficulty rewards persistence and usage of tools\n\n- Very grindy at high difficulty levels\n- Inconsistent tone in storytelling and presentation\n- PC Port is frame-locked at 30 FPS\n- Online functionality not included on the PC version\n\nThe player is a nameless ronin who arrives in the port of Amihama during a week of social unrest, and the actions they take determine the outcome of the upheaval. What makes this story interesting instead of typical is that the player's character can very heavily affect it through the things their ronin says, or does, or chooses not to do. The short time frame of the plot allows it to explore a large variety of story branches.\n\nCombat is simple, combo-based fighting, with about 80 pre-built styles of martial arts that range from practical to silly. What makes the system interesting is that players can take moves from any style they've learned and create their own personalized martial arts with them. If you like that one combo from a fast form, but want the stopping power from a strong form, put them together! If there's a passive ability you'd like to have, but don't like the moves it comes with in its own style, just borrow it to use in a new one. The system encourages mastering several different movesets in order to use them to create an even better set, and it's very satsfying to do.\n\nThere are eight normal endings and two hidden ones, encouraging replays based on the story alone. And if you don't want to follow the story, don't! You can leave the town at any time to start over, and preserve all the progress you made on your martial arts styles and equipment upgrades. If all your ronin wants to do is fish during the day, have affairs with people's wives at night, and then kick some butt in the martial arts tournament on day 4, you can do all that and be rewarded for it.\n\nA playthrough is short. This game was designed for you to finish a run in about two hours, and every time you start over (by finishing a story, leaving town, or dying and choosing to end the game), you affect the next game you play in several ways:\n\n* Your actions determine how Amihama flourishes or fails between games. For example, maybe a certain plot character might have lived through an attack and changed the course of the story, if the hospital had been open when they were hurt.\n\n* You affect the town's crime rate during gameplay, and it carries over to your next game. Shops' inventories and the types of citizens you meet on the street change based on how safe the town is.\n\n* If the game ends by obtaining a plot ending, the player's old character becomes a wandering duelist NPC in the next game, who you can encounter by chance and battle with.\n\n* You unlock a series of cosmetic options for making another player character. Want to play as one of the townsfolk? A ninja? A girl? A villain? A British man with a pistol? Some dude in his boxer shorts, red skin, and cat ears who only throws people? Well you can, after you get the appropriate items from the shops and unlock screens.\n\nThe more you play, the more options you have. If you're the sort of person who likes to try all possibilites and complete scavenger hunts, you will enjoy this challenge.\n\nWhile there's a lot about the above that I really like, there are some significant downsides to the game as well. Firstly, it suffers from being a PC port. While the game is more or less stable after a few patches (from an attentive company!) it does have the odd slowdown or crash that will agitate some people. The game is locked at 30FPS, as is typical of a lot of PS3 games, and while it doesn't really make a huge difference in gameplay, not having the awesome PC smoothness makes me sad.\n\nThe game itself can also be frustrating. On harder difficulties, even random, weak enemies have moves capable of killing you in one hit unless you prepare for them. You, on the other hand, have to go through quite a bit of upgrading your equipment and your martial arts before you'll be on a level playing field. Since a lot of the neat unlocks are only available on harder difficulties, be prepared for a journey if you're being a completionist.\n\nThe tone of the story is ridiculous. I don't know if it was the translation or what, but I...just have a hard time taking you seriously, when you name a no-nonsense warrior "Melinda Megamelons." The portrayal of the British in the game is plain silly, while the rest of the game seems more subdued. There are also some PG-rated sexytime and torture minigames that serve very little purpose, but are there for you anyway. They don't add much, other than being requirements for certain specific unlocks.\n\nLastly, a really cool feature didn't make it into the PC version. On the PS3, other players' characters could wander the town as NPCs with their custom equipment. Finding and defeating them could earn you a really great weapon without a ton of the tedium and luck required to build it yourself. Unfortunately there's no such capability for this on the PC version. All you'll see are your past characters, and they won't use upgraded gear on you.\n\nEven for the negative points above, I've dumped enough time into this game to feel good recommending it. Some of it's just a straight-up grind, but the rest of the experience is too interesting to ignore. Here's hoping the next game in the series gets a full port!","August 3, 2015","true","73.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I don't care about the supporting characters or their goals, there isn't any urgency in my objectives or resources (besides replacing constantly breaking swords), and it fails utterly to make me invest in the plot because I can change my mind about my position at basically any time, or just ignore it entirely.\n\nIn Way of the Samurai 2, with a proper parry and counter you could reap enemies like wheat, killing them as fast as they come (excepting major characters, which always provided a challenging and epic fight, showcasing weapons and fighting styles you only glimpse throughout the game).  In Way of the Samurai 4, every fight is a chore that drags on until all of the major characters in a fight flee (which takes several dozen hits each and you can't chase them down and finish them for their awesome weapons), you flee, or you trip over a body in the presence of a magistrate and get hauled off to jail with absolutely no fight.  Also, guns are really annoying because there's no decent way to close the distance to them.\n\nIn Way of the Samurai 2, with careful management of your defense, your weapons would last forever.  In this, unless you shell out for repair items like crazy, a sword will be on its last legs after 3 or 4 fights unless you upgrade it to death, which isn't really an option in the early game.  I mean, I wasn't struggling with money like I was in Way of the Samurai 2, so maybe this was a system change I was supposed to adapt to, but seriously, just doing odd jobs around town I had enough money to buy just about all of the character customization stuff and I felt no other need for it.\n\nIn Way of the Samurai 2, every sword type had it's own style and moveset.  If your sword breaks in the middle of a fight and you need a quick replacement, prepare to fight completely differently from how you were before, which showcases the wonderful combat variety in the game, and makes you want desperately to collect every weapon just to see all the moves and master the styles to find one that YOU like.  In Way of the Samurai 4, the styles are seperate from the swords, and whatever style you have equipped, all swords use that style.  So really the only difference between the swords are minor things like durability and length - protip: get a long one.  Reach is nice and has no detriment.  As for styles, yeah they're nice, but the system doesn't accomplish anything different from the old games except that your fighting style sucks massively for like the first 6 hours of the game before you find a new one (assuming you don't use the one from the Dojo which is meh, and only upgrades when you fight challengers which in the early game is asking for death).\n\nIn Way of the Samurai 2, even if you were horribly outmatched stat-wise, you could through skill and determination whittle down an opponent's health reliably.  In this, there's this thing called Vitality, which is very convenient when you use it, because you'll heal automatically during a fight for as long as you have it (though using halfway powerful attacks will drain it and you have to constantly eat food in the middle of a fight to keep it topped off), but your enemies have it too, and theirs always starts full.  You can whittle it down by beating them with the back of your sword, but they won't give up when it's all gone so doing that makes the fight feel twice as long.  If you do rapid damage consistently and quickly, they won't heal automatically, but take your eye off of them for a second and they'll come back at you with almost full health.\n\nAll in all, I found this to be a massive disappointment.  I'm glad I got it on sale.","December 1, 2015","false","8.5"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","21","37","3","2"

The game, as well as the rest of the series, is an extremely unrivaled exotic and cultural experience combined with the usual Japanese weirdness. Make your character, choose your moral, fight your fight, customize your weapon, do side-missions, have sex, recruit knife-wielding harlots to join your own dojo, do a flying kick in someone's mouth and much much more. The game does unfortunately have a frustrating flaw in its combat design though, making it easy to accidentaly hit innocents thus throwing them.....or the cops at you. The port might give you sound issues but this can mostly be fixed by adjusting the properties for your speakers etc.\nThe game is subjectively unplayable and suicidal on mouse&keyboard so i advise you to go for a gamepad.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAwarded for:\n\n- Best Japanese PC Port (steam version)\n- Best Japanese game (original)\n- Best Musical Score (original)\n- Best Asian Game on Steam (steam version)\n\nPorting Quality: 8/10\nGame Score: 8/10\nRe-playability: 7,9/10\nScore compared to predecessor: 5/10","July 23, 2015","true","33.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I have been studing traditional Japanese Jiujitsu and Iaido for quite a few years now, and really enjoy the accuracy and inacuracies in the game. here are a few pros and cons.\n\npros;\n1.) Gameplay is entertaining and simple to learn, no really complicated combos to work with.\n2.) Some of the forms in the game are real, and pretty much all the stances are moddled after real martial arts.\n3.) Really entertaining unlockables, costumes, weapons, styles, special moves ect ect.\n4.) Decisions and multiple endings, I love a game where your choices reflect the outcome of the game.\n\nCons;\n1.) Controlls are not as "fluid" as you might want them to be and sometimes you fight the camera during important fights.\n2.) They removed the "online" features from the counsol versions of the game, in the counsol you could see, fight, and collect the weapons from other peoples characters that would randomly wander into your world. (downside was they weren't played by the actual players they where mearly uploaded sprites and euqipment with an ai)\n3.) Can be difficult, the way of the samurai games have always been notably difficult, and while I personaly don't feel this is a "con" I placed it here as many other people have complained that it was too hard, and thier characters wheren't the godly over powered characters they feel samurai where or should be. (I personaly don't understand this as samurai died, a lot)\n4. No One-Hit-Kill mode like in previous games. In previous Way of the Samurai games you could unlock a mode after beating the game and purchasing it with the "samurai points" that would allow all swords both friend and foe to kill in one hit or close there too, which i felt added a level of realism. I mean you get cut with a katana straight across the neck or torso and tell me "it only hurts a little".\n5.) BIGGEST FLAW!!!!! the keyboard controlls suck bad, needs controller.\n\nTL;DR, good game but is dated and is a port I still recommend it for martial art game fans, 8/10.","January 8","true","39.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Fin, story ends and the credits rolled.\n\nNow into the actual review: The game is great as an idea. But I can't shake the idea that the execution isn't great. You have the fighting at the start of the game is a little longer if you fight a main character. Your damage is way low compare to the character level. The map is really stupid, it only display the places and that is about it. You can't zoom in or out and it doesnt tell you what is the next event is to progress the story. I had to sleep at night or next day to progress the story and sometimes have random events. You need to pay attention to the story otherwise you will feel lost. That is a problem since English isn't my native language. If you leave the game and then come back to play it later, you may also feel lost. Music sometimes disappear during cutscene and you only get background sound like the sea sound. The Steam layout doesn't change resolution so if you play on high resolution you can't read Steam layout at all. When you change the game resolution, make sure you change it on windowed first then go to full screen. Or you will get a really big zoomin in full window and you have to turn the resolution back.\n\nNow if you really ignore all these small problems you will find a gem here. I keep laughing at my choices and this is where the game shines. Do I recommend this game? Definatly, this is one of the best games where your choices really affect the gameplay, story, and your character's life.\n\nEdit: So far 20 hours of gameplay and I never once past the 4th day ingame. Repeated the game so many times and I still love every second of it, because each gameplay is different.

Or The rebels. Or The British. Or decide to not join anyone at all and open a language school, dojo, or do dirty business for the local mob lord. The game is very free-form, with several routes determining which one of the several ending you'll get, and several activities to entretain yourself with. It also has new game+, allowing you to experience all of it with your gear and money intact on each playthrough.\n\nGraphically, the game's not much of a looker,pretty identical to the PS3 version, to the point of there being barely any GFX options at all[pbs.twimg.com] (They've added a few more, like a DoF settings, in an .ini file), though it does support most arbitrary resolutions (although 1920x1200 is conspicuously missing for me). It also has a very dreadful 30fps cap due to gamelogic being tied to framerate, but at least the game fully maintains the targeted 30fps even with toaster machines.\n\nGhostlight DID cut one feature from the PS3 version, but it's not the torture scenes, as you might expect (those are in), but the Dark Souls-esque feature of having other people's characters "invade" your world. Your own characters from previous playthroughs  still show up roaming around.\n\n\nBasically,the game is a lot of fun.Quite fun enough to recommend it. But if you're a stickler for FPS or cut gameplay content, you might want to wait for a deep discount or just skip it.\n\n(A thank you to Ghostlight for the free copy of the game)","July 23, 2015","true","15.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

A bizarre mix of the absurdity of Deadly Premonition and the campy dialogue and weapon collect-a-thons of Dynasty Warriors, with branching paths to rival Alpha Protocol. The 1850s town of Amihama is your samurai’s own sandbox, in which you’re free to pursue alliances with one of the three competing factions, or just go and do your own thing.\n\nDoing your own thing can mean dressing up like Blood on the Tracks era Bob Dylan and harassing every civilian you see. Or running strange errands for a guy under some carriage tracks. Or conspiring with some ultra-nationalists in a cave. Or sassing a government official in the middle of his big speech. Or failing to communicate with British people because the language school isn’t open yet.\n\nThe PC version of Way of the Samurai 4 offers (much) higher resolutions, a solid (albeit capped) frame-rate, and much-reduced loading times over its console counterpart. It’s a stable, straightforward port with constraints that largely seem tied to things that were out of the coders’ hands, but fans of the series will definitely enjoy this cult classic.","July 23, 2015","true","4.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

You can do whatever you want, when you want. The game is short (about 2-4+ depending on how much you focus on the main storyline) but the replayability is there, you will want to play through the story over and over again to see what things you could have done differently.\n\nMy only gripes with the game are the lack of mouse support and the simplistic combat. Acquiring and leveling up different weapon styles is fun but I wish you could fight with more than just 1 enemy at a time, a little bit more of an action-RPG feel would have given me a much cooler feeling as a badass samurai. Mouse support is being patched into the game but there are times when I am in combat and I can clearly tell the game was designed for a controller. For instance, if you are not directly aligned with the camera there are times when your character cannot dodge and only flails in place. This can be frustrating when you are fighting difficult enemies in a narrow space as the camera will swing around into unadvantageous positions. The inability to dodge is due to the W, A, S, D keys having a lesser range of motion when compared to a joystick on a controller. Very annoying occurance on a PC port.\n\nOverall I've had a lot of fun with this game, despite a few annoyances and I recommend it to anyone looking to have a good time with a game that doesn't take itself too seriously, as well as a game that provides ACTUAL CHOICE and paths that truly branch off.","August 3, 2015","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Custom weapons make a return, as well as a means to make your own fighting style; both of which can take some time to gather what you need to create it, but if you played the last three then you are familiar with that kind of grind. The game's new ability, Spring harvest, is essentially this special mode where you can go berserk on the controls just slicing everything up, and generally good for large scale fights you want to blaze through or to unleash hell on one really tough opponent.\n\nThe story is nothing special, but branches out a good deal based on your choices. It's also a nice touch to add an event chart to look back at outcomes you have explored in past playthroughs and to see how many other paths certain scenes can take.  Once again, like the prior games, all characters you encounter are killable. This includes the main characters of the story, provided you have the skills and equipment to win. While most of the story tries to play itself serious, between the more ridiculous moments you can explore and the even more ridiculous costume options for your character this seriousness (for me at least) can and often goes right out the window and never to be seen again.\n\nOverall, if you liked the prior Samurai games or if you are new and want to play a fashion-attrocity samurai beating his opponents to death with a blunt bamboo stick like its nobody's buisness all while drinking sake then this one is recommended.","July 28, 2015","true","87.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Choose your own samurai adventure in a bustling port full of nutty Englishmen, sadistic princesses, sinister ministers, xenophobic rebels, and all kinds of oddballs. Clothing options are plentiful, and as silly or serious as you want them to be. Be that jerk who interrupts people all the time with inane banter! Start a dojo and drag any warm bodies off the street to be your pupils! Help out those in distress by saving their marriage, or murdering witnesses! Find or forge all sorts of weapons, learn dozens of fighting styles and even invent your own!\n\nIt's not perfect, though. Combat can be uneven, as there's no telling how strong your opponent will be until you start trading blows, but beyond that it's on you to pay attention to an enemy's movements and respond accordingly. Fighting styles take work to unlock their full potential, and with so many to learn, it's hard to give them all a fair shake. Speaking of which, you need a well-staffed dojo with a good rep to really get into the unique fighting styles, but it can and WILL get attacked regularly by challengers, who will likely kill your students and ruin your rep if you don't drop everything and rush over to beat them.\n\nAll in all, though, it's a fun experience and well worth getting into.","January 3","true","58.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Way of the Samurai 4 is a game of surprising depth and complexity. Much more than just a game about dudes with swords, but certainly has plenty of dudes with swords in it, if that's what you happen to be here for. Similar to a visual novel game, the story in Samurai 4 takes place over a pre-defined time span, and is event driven. Some events are consistant for each play through, while some offer choices which determine what happens later in the story.\nSamurai 4 is ostensibly set in pre-civil war Japan, but with a number of fun anachronisms to keep things interesting. A diplomatic envoy from Great Britan has opened negotiations with the local Magistrate to bring in new technology and establish trade between the two nations, but a faction of xenophobic traditionalists fear that the integration of the new culture will damage the classical "Yamato spirit" identity they are proud of. This sets the backdrop for the player's character, a transient swordsman with no default personality, to forge a new future for Japan.\nThe swordplay is overall pretty good, but the real fun is in the ability to get in and customize how your character fights by obtaining different weapons and stances from different characters. Weapons can be broken down into parts and re-assembled, and any combination of parts can be sharpened and reinforced to the statistic cap. Eventually, even custom movelists can be assembled making wholly unique spear and swordfighting styles.\n\nWhat makes Samurai 4 noteworthy? Our player insertion character is time-locked "Groundhog's Day" style in this week, replaying it over as many times as we, as the player, want to. And so, it isn't in playing, but in re-playing, that Samurai 4 starts getting interesting. Some things are carried over between stories, such as the main character's swords and whether or not some of the locations are open, but the main events reset each time. With the fore-knowledge granted from having lived through the week once before, the player can manipulate the outcome by chosing who to support and who to confront, and when. A journal is kept, showing which potential events the main character has participated in across all play throughs.\n\nA cautionary note; Way of the Samurai 4 does contain a *lot* of partial nudity and crude humor, on par with the Saint's Row series. The game is only translated to languages other than Japanese in subtitles. If that doesn't put you off, however, Samurai 4 is well, WELL worth your attention. Your Samurai honor demands that you rise to the challenge.","January 11","true","29.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Maybe because this was originally a console game, but I digress.\n\nA couple gripes to get out of the way beforehand: The camera sucks, and sometimes the game will crash on startup or talking to the clothing store owner.\n\nWay of the Samurai 4 is fantastic. Combat isn't too special, but offers enough variety to float the rest of the game along, which is where this WotS4 really shines. The character customization in this game opens up a ton of hilarious possibilities, and having your goofy idiot character show up in cutscenes acting serious is part of what I genuinely enjoyed. I went through the true ending as a cowboy resembling Woody from Toy Story, and it was a great time.\n\nThere are 10 different endings, the 8 that have you align with a certain faction are rather flat, for lack of a better word, but attune you to the fact that things could be much better, this kind of grooms you to obtain the true ending. Additionally, going through each path reveals different plot points that occur while you're doing other things in subsequent playthroughs.\n\nAs for the true ending itself, I enjoyed it most of all. It feels very much like a spaghetti western and really fufilling to obtain after going through the faction paths. Definitely worth the work, look up a guide if you must, some parts of it are obscure.\n\nAs others have said, there is ALWAYS something for you to be doing in this game if you're not dealing with the story: helping strangers, homeless, magistrate, yakuza, sleeping with women, eating, upgrading your sword, killing characters from previous runs that roam the streets, whatever you want.\n\nWay of the Samurai 4 is ABSOLUTELY worth the $25. Go. Go buy it right now and make a samurai with a Sake bottle for a head and an oni mask for a face.","September 23, 2015","true","38.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ottomic/recommended/312780/","Ottomic","Ottomic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ottomic/","282 products in account","This is going to be a long review. And a strange one as well, probably. Way of the Samurai is an extremely straightforward game, and yet there's so much to talk about it. I will try to give it a review as in-depth as possible from the perspective of someone who has *never* played the series, but the TLDR is that for a 20 buck game you should probably pick it up.\n\nGraphically, the game looks okay, despite showing some age. It's not only the fact that it's 4 years old, but that by then those graphics were hardly cutting edge by 2011, the year of Skyrim. There are hardly any gimmicks in that aspect: most of the game occurs in a rather small play area, there is no clothing damage that had appeared in earlier installments and the gore is pretty minimal. Still, they are very functional, and the feeling of cheapness fits super well with the B movie feel of the game, much like in Deadly Premonition, but more on that later. The game is locked to 30 FPS but I really doubt that will ever bother you unless you care more about a counter than a game, in which case I'd urge you to go to Word and type a random 5 digit number and proceed to masturbate furiously for the next bunch of hours. Bottom line, it looks okay. Really okay.\n\nThe customization options are also one of the highlights of the game: you can place, move and resize every accessory in your Samurai, allowing you to be as boring or creative as you want to. Want a nude samurai with a medal loincloth? How about Oni nipple tassels? Dude made out of boxes? You got it!\n\nSound's alright. Music can become a bit repetitive by the 20,000th time you hear a song, but for a 1-track-per-event ost I have no complaints. Sound effects are also functional. The voices is where the game really shines though. Most of the sound bits you can hear when going through ingame text are different and match the voice actor you're talking to. The entire game is in Japanese with English subtitles, and peppered with delicious, delicious Engrish that always gets a chuckle out of me.\n\nNow. Onto the gameplay. First thing you'll notice is that the game is goofy. Extremely so. From the 10-year-old British ambassador to the 3 S&M adept daughters of the Minister, the game proudly turns the camp to 11 and puts you in aggressively cheesy scenes more often than not. Whether you want to cope with that is up to you, but I gotta say that for all the general weirdness the game accomplishes to be fun without going into aggravating territory. Lots of puns, lots of terrible humor and hilarious interpretations of Western culture much like in Deadly Premonition, but easily within parameters, despite everything. Some of the storylines are more grounded, if kinda topical, but again this feels like it's really aiming for B-movie throwbacks while keeping some humor about it. Kinda hit or miss, but I'd be hard pressed to find a moment where I genuinely wanted to just shut down the game, besides, almost everything can be skipped or fast-forwarded. And most of the events are purely accessory. Speaking of which:\n\nThe game happens along 5 days, divided into day, evening and night. Time will only advance if one goes to sleep or does the next story mission, which means you can choose what to do and when. At the end of those 5 days (or earlier) , depending on what you've done, you'll get an ending out of the 10 possibles, most of whose are pretty different from each other. At the end of the game you'll carry your items and gear to the next playthrough, and so on. That means the game is crazy replayable, what with the several optional storylines, side activities (like running your own dojo or doing parallel quests), possible outcomes of the primary missions and the customization. But we're still missing the actual meat and potatoes of the replayability factor and the game itself, and those are the weapons and styles.\n\nAt the start of the game you can wield swords, spears or do hand-to-hand martial arts. As you unlock further upgrades you'll also be able to equip guns, rifles, claws and akimbo katanas, using the samurai points you'll obtain after each ending (along with new difficulty levels, customization options, etc). On top of that you have the several fighting styles for every weapon type, each based in a stance, of about 11 or so different stances in the whole game. Getting better in a certain style will unlock new moves for that stance, and you'll be able to make your own fighting style using unlocked moves, integrating up to 3 different stances. You can also dismantle every weapon you come across and assemble the parts into new weapons: make them to look how you like, try to stack Charms on them, improve their durability and strength, the like. Missions aside, crafting itself is a quite interesting side activity that invites you to waste your time (and pretty much your time only, as it's pretty much assumed you'll savescum, or at least many hours "fishing" for your wanted part) but not only you're given several ways to make that grinding happen, it's pretty much optional, so you're not confronted by a number wall that you need to vault to continue on your story. And even if you find the game getting too frustrating for your taste, you can always restart the whole thing while keeping your stuff, much like in Majora's Mask.\n\nIn brief, this is a pretty hilarious game, with pretty good controls, pretty good fighting, very "horizontal" content (lots of optative parallel stuff) and great customization options. It is not perfect: despite the tutorials at the beginning the game can result pretty frustrating on your first playthrough while you figure stuff out and there's stuff I'd have done differently or at least explained better, but again, in general I think it's a pretty cool game overall.\n\n7.5. Add an extra point if you enjoyed Deadly Premonition's intensely weird, yet clearly love-injected personality.","July 24, 2015","true","68.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You're dropped into the world with the conflict of the plot all laid out in the first cutscene with a handful of sides to choose between.  The plot doesn't matter.  It's not too impressive; nothing to write home about, that's for sure.  The purpose it serves is as a framework for the rest of the game to hang on.  A wild weave of opportunities for the player to create and achieve their own goals within the game world.\n\nA single playthrough of the story will not do you this game justice.  That's the real tutorial.  Once you beat the game once, the real Way of the Samurai only begins.  In Way of the Samurai, 'New Game +' (starting the game anew while carrying over all personal progress) isn't a kind addition, it's essential, a core mechanic, the crux of the experience.\n\n'Beating' the game isn't getting one of the story endings (of which there are multiple possibilities based on which sides of the conflict you choose to aid at different points in the story).  I would argue that there is no real way to beat the game that isn't wholly up to the player.  The game facilitates setting and achieving meta-goals, which could be getting specific endings, or crafting the perfect sword and upgrading it to reach its maximum potential, or acquiring and learning every sword-fighting style with a specific stance, or running the best Dojo possible, or completing hidden objectives, acquiring specific rare/special weapons, performing the tasks necessary to acquire rare unlocks... There's a lot to do.  Do yourself a favor if you choose to play the game and spend time trying to discover it.\n\nThe game is pretty rough.  The localization feels a bit loose (but is entirely serviceable), and there are consistent issues with audio in the port that Ghostlight do seem to be attempting to solve.\n\nI would only recommend the game to people who are able to find Japanese game design quirk appealing.","July 30, 2015","true","38.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There's a large amount of content between various branching paths and completionist collectibles, and it's all pretty dang fun. The combat can feel a tad clunky at first, but once you begin picking up different styles and trying them out, it's very satisfying. In general, working your way up from penniless loser to King Killmaster of Samurai Sterotype Island is really great. The game doesn't take itself too seriously, but the story is still quite interesting and enjoyable. This is probably the first "gotcha" bad end I've ever gotten where I didn't feel ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and cheated, but excited to play the game more.\n\nI've played the PS3 version a ton, and have been anticipating the PC release. The major delay seems to have been worth it, as the port seems to run smoothly, with full controller support. There are small performance hiccups now and then, but honestly those were in the PS3 version too. It's slightly annoying they didn't just put this out as a "definitive" edition with al the DLC, but considering like half of it is just there to unlock items for you easier, I don't really see the problem.

Along with a fully customisable blacksmith which allows for you to build your own weapons, upgrade them to be stronger or simply change their look.\nAs you play you can pick how you wish to engage in combat, will you cut down enemies or beat them with the backside of your blade sparing their lives but dishonouring them.\nIn comparison to the ps3 game, the game itself saves quicker, loads quicker, the frame rate is more stable and the graphics look slightly sharper so if you have played the ps3 version I would highly recommend getting the pc version due to its updates and to show the developer that the pc market wants to see more games that are unique, doing so Acquire might port Way of the Samurai 3 which boasts 27 different endings and a more time period most people enjoy more than the late Japanese era.\nI never thought I would see Way of the Samurai 4 enter the pc market and to see it is nothing short of a miracle, I do so hope if you enjoy the time period, samurai games or just free roam games with a ton of replay ability you will pick this up, as stated before in this review if Acquire see that the game can make back its port cost we might get more of their games like the Tenchu games or Way of the Samurai 3, it worked with Capcom so why not with Acquire?\n","July 23, 2015","true","8.0"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","13","24","3","0"

Just... universally great. So even a bad Way of the Samurai game is still a good game. And, make no mistake, Way of the Samurai 4 is (by quite a bit) the worst of the lot.\n\nWay of the Samurai games are sandbox samurai sims. They take place in small, localized settings that allow for a great deal of reactivity--more than 10 wildly different endings are simply a matter of course. Also a matter of course? A ton of customization options for how your character looks and fights (there are dozens of different fighting styles to master and hundreds of different weapons to collect). They also originated on the Playstation 2 console and have not evolved much beyond that--expect small, sparsely-detailed environments with stiff animations, muddy textures, floaty controls, and loading screens everywhere.\n\nWay of the Samurai 4 ditches most of the Kurosawa-aesthetic that made the prior games so special in favor of embracing the sillier aspects of the series. Prior games were careful to maintain a balanced tone that was sometimes serious, sometimes silly, and always at least a little engaging. But the fourth game is... just completely ridiculous. Any pretense of serious storytelling is tossed out the window less than five minutes into the game when you meet the British ambassador--a prepubescent girl dressed as a lolita--and the captain of her personal guard, a woman clad in gleaming golden plate mail named "Megamelons."\n\nRather than a proper Way of the Samurai game, WotS4 feels much more like a parody of a WotS game. The gameplay and narrative reactivity is all there... just a little off. Animation and voice acting is sufficiently over-the-top to evoke the lowest-budget Japanese Jidaigeki, or period-dramas. Think Samurai B-movies.\n\nSo: is all of this an endorsement of Way of the Samurai 4 or a condemnation? I don't know. Let's call it a hesitant endorsement for now. It's the worst of the series, by far, but still decent enough in its own right.\n\nSo what's the problem?\n\nBecause the game runs like ♥♥♥. I don't know who deserves the blame more: Ghostlight, who ported WotS4, or Acquire, who developed the original for the Playstation 3. The PS3 version of WotS4 is a glitchy, buggy cluster♥♥♥♥ of a game--and this PC port is no different.\n\n(Which can only make me wonder and what kind of horrendous state the game must have been in back in March 2015 that Ghostlight chose to delay its release on Steam three months).\n\nJust take it for granted that the game will crash. Frequently. Also be aware that attempting to start a new game will often crash the game, and that trying to change the resolution or even exit the game will ALWAYS cause it to crash. And be warned that the game is locked at a framerate of 30fps, and no, don't bother to try and mod it, this is yet another console game that's tied physics to framerate.\n\nThing is: the PS3 version is just as bad. So, being on Steam, I guess this is (theoretically) the superior version? It's a toss-up. Both are pretty rubbish. It sure seems like Acquire has been using the same engine (and same assets) for every single Way of the Samurai game they've ever made, so I can only guess why each new game is buggier and less stable than the next. I imagine an office in mid-town filled with dozens of howling gibbons--and maybe one or two guys in the corner who really, really love Jidaigeki shows.\n\nSo: buy the game if you understand its (many) shortcomings; ignore it (please) if anything I've mentioned even remotely sounds like a deal-breaker, because--believe me--the person writing this review is very much a fan of the series, the time period, the subject matter, and all the many other games, movies, anime, and television series that inspired it. In short: I am predisposed to think more highly of this game than the average person reading this.","July 30, 2015","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can make swords, name them, upgrade them ect ect.\n\nBut the best thing in this game is watching the japanease equivilant of the state police react to you refusing to help them by calling them stupidheads. Alternatively you can have diner with the head of state and ask if you can have his daughters for desert.\n\nWay of the samurai for is not serious game. That said some of the ending paths are pretty deep.\n\nEverything you do in this game effects the next set of events and the next play through.\n\nFor example, you can help open up a hospital. next play through the hospital is already open so instead you can protect medical supplies to help the hospital. and thats just for one of the 3 factions on one of the 3 buildings that effect the area.\n\nThis game has everything you need. Swords, Samurai's, triplets, tourture, comedic woohoo minigame, side missions, several endings, multiple fighting styles and a sense of humor.\n\n10/10 stupidheads.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that in most cutscenes you can just whip out your sword and start a fight for reasons. The freedowm in this game is outstanding and some endings require you to do more than pick a binary answers. sometimes the solutions is a bit out of the box.","July 30, 2015","true","63.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All in all, the biggest issue i was faced with was who was right.\n\nThis game offers:\n\nFair challenge (You MUST know how to combo in this game. The AI adapts to your moves and counters them.)\n\nChoice of the player (Weapon/character creation, chosing sides, etc.)\n\nA unique way to make an endless storyline. (I like the way how they made it so if you get a true ending, you can get to face the samurai you beat the game with!)\n\nDon't be daunted by 30 fps, this game is still worth the purchase and runs very smoothly regardless.

Fans of swordplay, important decisions and wacky japanese comedy will find a hidden gem here.\n\nAlso there's a flamboyant British man who will steal your heart.","August 20, 2015","true","41.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I haven't got very far as of yet. I played the other Way of the Samurai games on console so it takes a little getting used to. As I have played I noticed that there are a lot of glitches where I can’t see people faces or I see their underwear under their clothes :/ trust me it’s not pleasant.\n\nThe glitches may be due in part to my laptop being bout seven years old. Also in cut scenes’ speech is very delayed. A character will say something and I have to wait about 30 seconds before they say something else or my character can reply.  Again it’s probably because of using and older out date laptop but the game lags making running look like running in slow motion.\n\nI have to admit I'm not a proponent mixing guns with samurai however they character that use them are pretty easy to defeat. The game has its ups and downs for sure. I love that it’s in Japanese with English subtitles making for a better experience. There are even more customization’s than the previous games and just as many possible story lines and possibly more.","November 18, 2015","true","32.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thats not to say this is a bad game of course, In fact its really enjoyable.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nIn my opinion the combat system in the game is what really sticks out. Its smooth and tons of fun, while also discouraging button mashing as any enemy can block most of your attack, forcing you to chain together movements and attacks to get past their defences.\n\nStory: 7/10\nThe game is set in Japan during the Meiji era, when Japan had its doors open to westerners for the very first time. You play as a ronin, a masterless samurai, arriving in the town of Amihara. From here you can make choices regarding 3 factions and based of your choices different events can occur.\n\nCharacter Customization: 4/10\nCustomization is pretty slim, though you can choose from plenty of costumes and accessories, thats really all you can do beside choosing gender and skin color.\n\nSide Missons: 6/10\nSide missions are where the game can either make it or break it. Most of them are short and simple, being there to throw you some extra yen to buy those sunglasses you want. But many of them, such as the dojo, are loads of fun.\n\nFinal Verdict: 6.5/10\nThis game is definitely above average, and i would have loved to give it a higher rating. But the game loses points due to the sheer amount of potential that seemed to have been ignored. Given time and effort, Way of the Samurai 4 could have been an exellent game. But parts of the game seem rushed and unpolished and many scenes in the game come off as awkward. The story is decent, but it never feels like any of the choices you make are actually meaningful and its not hard to blow past the story without getting invested in any of the characters. Then again combat is satisfying and fun and certain missions and events can easily pull you back into the game despite it's goofy nature, so in an odd way I'm still recommending it.","May 6","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The fighting is odd and it really doesn't do too much to teach you what to do. It kind of just throws you right into it.\n\nYou get missions by talking to people or going to the pink icons on your map, you pick people you want to do work for and then you do it,or you don't. It's up to you.\n\nThe game is very short, but that is one of the best parts about it. Every play through will directly change the world in the next one. You may think you are doing the right thing and then the game will flip it upside down on your head and you will go into the next play through with a burning desire to kill somebody that wronged you in the last one.\n\nEveryone raves about how the game doesn't take itself seriously and is very funny, it's true, but not so over the top that you feel like you are in a circus.\n\nEither way, if you are into samurai and/or sword fighting pick this one up. Definitely 10/10 from me.","April 12","true","39.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That being said, it's nice to have the series on the PC without having to emulate.  There is a pretty good selection of weapons, and style is no longer bound to individual weapons, letting you select styles individually.  Updates have been pretty consistent, adding a lot of features like FoV and depth of field options, mouse compatibility, etc.  They've been showing willingness to adapt the title to PC which makes me super happy; it's not just another port dumped onto steam.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty good game worth dropping some time into if you're into swordfighting games or samurai stuff.","July 31, 2015","true","28.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

At first I was like, "yeah, not my problem", but some random lady told me to 'Samurai' so I figured she was trying insult me.  After killing all of the random dudes, some  Japanese Speaking British Lady who looked to be 15 years old said "Thanks." and "Follow me"  Naturally I didn't.  After wondering around the city, I found a small shop that sold earthworms for fishing.  Figuring I could eat what I catch, I bought 10 worms.  Now, I'll be the first to admit that I'm lazy.  Very lazy.  So instead of finding some place that probably had fish in it, I decided to start fishing right beside the man that sold me the worms.  Soon a battle between me and a monster fish broke out.  After several seconds of power struggling, I won.  The great 8 cm beast was no match for my EXTREME fishing skills!  I knew I had to show this fish to the worm salesman.  To my surprise, the fish was worth more than the worms...  I know what I will do with my life...\n\n10/10 best fishing simulator on Steam.","July 31, 2015","true","51.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Some of the events feel so coincidential they almost have to be googled, which can be good or bad, but simply put, there's a lot to explore.\n+The story can be generic with a sort of "go here, do this", but the characters have human passions and beliefs though they act silly (the silliness can also be a boon as it's often amusing).\n+There are a large number of fighting styles, and you can make your own.\n\n-The combat has blocking, dodging, combos, and so on, but it's all too simple to find and repeat a combo to keep your enemy staggered, so it can be repetitive.\n-The PC port has a few bugs for me, nothing too troublesome. You need a controller as there's no mouse support.\n-Allegedly they promised DLC and failed to deliver.\n-Swords are based on a shallow system where only damage is worth much consideration.\n-Crafting is grindy, involving hours to get certain charms or inscription (max of each, anyways). Again, damage is the primarily important stat, at least for beating the campaign, and there is no multiplayer.\n\nChoosing between yes and no really tears me apart, but I opt for yes in subjectivity. I didn't particularly mind the repetition because of the many styles. I actually enjoy grinding to a limited extent after doing much more in MMOs. The bugs were extremely minor for me, and I already own a controller, so no harm done there. The swords complaint is relatively insignificant. The only thing I'm somewhat salty about is the DLC, but then, I can't even find any online evidence of reviewers' claims.","November 15, 2015","true","16.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

The game sets you in a japanese town around the time of the Black Ships arriving in Japan to break its isolation with the rest of the world. This leads to conflict between the newly arrived "foreigners" and the anti0foreign movement with the Shogunate or police trying to keep the peace.\n\nIt's up to you what happens, you could side with any of the groups and support their goals or stand back and let events unfold. Your choice in how the story plays out matters greatly.\n\nThe game features a proof of life system which shows your actions from the previous game carried over, such as the language school being open and allowing you to speak to the foreigners. The game has huge replayability as there are multiple DIFFERENT endings, not just with small variation.\n\nYou don't need to play the other 3 to play this one as the story doesn't pass over though small hints and nods to the previous games feature throughout.\nOverall this is a fun rpg for those who love samurai and their history or for those looking to kill a few hours with a very reasonable priced game.

I never actually gave the game a chance, and watching videos on it now, makes me even more angrier with my choice of refunding this game.

Imagine my surprise when this came on steam.\n\nHonestly it's a great game despite underneath some technical limitations. It's not the best looking game but it makes up for it in wonderous fun and freedom. You do kind of just what you want, it's an open world that's not padded out with simple collectibles or waypoints for you to find (well there's stuff to collect too). A lot of what you do inadvertently affects the game, open a language school and be able to talk to foreigners, wander around randomly killing people and eventually the crime rate goes down which in turns can affect other aspects of the game.\n\nThis isn't a long game but it's meant to be replayable over and over. I think it's something more games should consider doing, where your past decision actually affects dialog and missions and the routes you can take.\n\ntl;dr: Not the best looking game but underneath it all lies a kind of fun and genius that I wished was explored more in bigger budget titles.

It seems that if you want to have fun, you get penalized.\n\n****Unless you're seriously into deep role playing by the bushido code, this game is not for you.****\n(even then, the game doesn't seem to care how honorable you behave)\n\nMost of the time you wonder how someone sneezed at you and killed you. Difficulty wise, even on "easy"; it's either a kick to the nuts or a walk in the park. No in-between.\n\nOh, and the DLC? Not present/avaliable immediately, it needs to be unlocked by being on your best behaviour and clearing the game. Multiple times.\n\nAccidentally kicked a corpse because the NPC you're fighting backs up over it? PENALTY!\n\nNPC asks you to bring something to a place to help someone they wronged in the past? PENALTY, DISHONORABLE TASK PERFORMED!\n\nFollowing the story, doing things that seem right and justified? PENALTY, YOU'RE NOT A REAL SAMURAI; WHY ARE YOU EVEN BOTHERING TO PLAY THIS GAME?! GO HOME AND BE A FAMILY MAN!!\n\nGoogle searched how a Samurai should act, role played as one to a T for a whole story chain? PENALTY!!! YOU STILL ♥♥♥♥ED UP SOMEHOW!!\n\nThe only good points to this game, are being able to keep items and money in a certain location through multiple characters. the customization is very nice, and there are many stances that can be chosen freely (after unlocking...)\nFor example, if you took the blade from the huge katana (nodachi?) and matched it with X guard and Y handle, it doesn't just give you a motion set with it. You can use the same style for that giant sword, as you would for a very short katana (tanto?).\n\n\n*****TL;DR: If you choose to buy this game, know you are in for one tough game that punishes you for playing it. But the character customization system is nice, so there's that.*****\n\nEDIT: Removed reccomendation for different game, because some salty prick claimed it was illegal to guide others towards way better games.","January 1","false","18.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","6","11","3","0"

Maybe it's just my machine that can't process some of the graphics, but I doubt it.\n\nIf you've played any WotS-games before, you'll most likely be right at home. For those who are newcomers to the franchise, I'll inform you that the game has several endings, depending on where you are at certain times, who you talk to among the main characters. You unlock new options for customization and combat by completing the game, so don't be afraid to do story-missions since the game is pretty short.

This game is a big story sandbox game where you get to decide how you wanna live you're life as a samurai to do good or do bad you will choose, Many different swords in the game along with many different martial art styles you can choose, Master all of them to become a great samurai do jobs for people or be evil and kill everything that moves\n\nThis game is very amazing and i am very happy ghostlight was able to do this so i hope you guys found my review helpful its short but everything is fine runs smooth amazing and addicting","July 26, 2015","true","47.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I will try to keep this short and clear:\n\nThe game is based on open world features ( a fictional island called Amihama and the time is arround 1860), the areas are devided in: accessible black ship, harbor, main plaza, town, shrine, crossroads, graveyard, little britain and the migstrates office. It also features different times of day and the missions of the story mode sometimes depend on the time of day.\n\nYou can customize your charakter like hair, clothes, faces and later also the gender, you also can craft your own weapons like spears, katanas, ninja swords, firearms and many more. There are hundreds of parts you can obtain also depending on the difficulty level.\n\nThere are diverse minigames you can play like gambling, dating women, developing your own dojo, catch fish and many more.\n\nYou can chose a faction you want to work for and develope the story completely on your actions and decisions. It offers 10 different endings. There are also many job brokers in town or you can ask one of the wandering samurai or townspeople for a job.\n\nYou can chose between many skills and stances or develope your own.  Battles as you can see from screenshots are real time and you can trigger heavy slashes, light slashes, evade or block attacks and grab your enemy to kick or punch him. You also can fight with bare hands.\n\nGraphics are a bit outdated and as mentioned based on the ps3 console but if you like samurai games, the game offers a nice atmosphere. If you already know the prequels of way of the samurai you can be assured that this game includes almost every element you know/ liked plus additional new content. The only thing you might get used to is the style of certain charakters, the game now has many accessiors like funny beards, glasses or characters like female knights and an english girl serving as diplomatic agent which add a bit of an unseriousness to the game. The previous titles in that matter were a bit straight and serious.\n\nService of the publisher is nice and they stay in touch with the community to improve the game experience. Many patches recently have fixed bugs and improved gamecontrolls very well.\n\nIf you collect steam achievements, trading cards and backgrounds, WotS 4 got very great stuff to offer as well.\n\nI was hestitant to buy this game because i already have it on the PS3 but from my side i can say it was worth buying. Thumbs up for a great console to pc port.","July 29, 2015","true","185.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There are A LOT of choices to make during the course of the story, which drastically increases its replayability. The fighting mechanics are easy to understand, but difficult to master. You can easily spend hours on additional activities such as gambling, flirting and even having sex - sometimes very extravagant and extreme! Game was originally released on PlayStation 3 so graphics and animations are a bit dated, but the gameplay isn't - provided you like Japanese games such as Yakuza. Be aware that there are only Japanese voices available!\n\nUnfortunatelly, the PC version suffers from some annoyances. Game is locked to 30 FPS, graphics options are nonexistent (you can only choose resolution and toggle windowed/fullscreen), you cannot rotate the camera with mouse and default key bindings require you to have like 3 arms with 10 fingers each (=gamepad HIGHLY recommended). Seems quite optimized though - you can easily achieve flawless 4K on a single GTX 970 (probably possible on older cards as well).\n\nApart from that, it's a nice game, well worth the reduced price (13,79€)!","July 23, 2015","true","2.8"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","9","18","0","0"

You have 4-5 in-game days to decide who wins or you can just blow them off and do you own thing. Open a dojo or be a hired assassin if the main stories don't suit your needs. At the end of each playthrough you get to save and start all over. The game changes based on your previous decisions. If you were a xenophobe and really stuck it to the foreigners in your last playthrough, they will hit harder on your next playtrhough. Everything you worked for carries over to the next playthrough so every time you start over you feel more and more comfortable.\n\nGame has about a dozen or so endings to be seen, titles to earn after each run and a wide selection of customization for you character so you never have to wear the same clothes or even the same face twice. The weapon crafting and arts mastering is incredibly fun and adds a lot to an already pretty robust experience. People like to claim it's a pretty shallow game but even after unlocking all the endings I can still see another 5-10 runs in order to finish my weapons and picking up a few more steam acheives.\n\nGame has some of the hardest weapon crafting I've ever come across. Making your ultimate weapon will take quite a few runs and even then making it as powerful as it can be will take you a few more. Even with the strongest most beefed up sword in the game the hardest difficulty will still completely destroy you so it's quite a fun task of learning your style and how you can get the most out of it.\n\nimo a great game for the price. I would get the DLC that add new missions, but not the stuff like scrolls or iron. My only gripe is the lack of clothing options for your female character.","December 6, 2015","true","31.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

WotS4 is the type of game you dont take too seriously and play and every which way the develpors will allow you, and as many times as you can. And thats really the point, people may complain about the 2-4 hours of gameplay, but you're kinda supposed to beat it, over and over and over and over again, whilst carrying on your character frome previous play throughs. Just so you can find how many ways you can get to the 10 different endings. Customization is also nice, limited, but nice. From your clothes, to your weapons, to even your fighting styles. Lots of options.\nThe world is also very small. Open world, yes, but but you can check everything out pretty quick.\nUnfortunately, it falls a little short when it comes to fun factor. Things can get annoying pretty quick when it comes to battles. Your weapons can degrade and break in this game, which is fine, it adds some edge and personality to the game. Except, this happens way too easy and fast, especially at the beginning of the game. Not only that, but enemies regain life during battle, forcing you to just mash your attacks on them so they dont have a chance to recover before either you blade breaks, or they do.\nThis was honestly the biggest gripe i had with this game, it frustrated more than it challenged.\nHonestly, i liked Way of the Samurai 3 better.\nYour better off borrowing or renting this game.","December 5, 2015","false","24.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I will try to keep this short and clear:\n\nThe game is based on open world features ( a fictional island called Amihama and the time is arround 1860), the areas are devided in: accessible black ship, harbor, main plaza, town, shrine, crossroads, graveyard, little britain and the migstrates office. It also features different times of day and the missions of the story mode sometimes depend on the time of day.\n\nYou can customize your charakter like hair, clothes, faces and later also the gender, you also can craft your own weapons like spears, katanas, ninja swords, firearms and many more. There are hundreds of parts you can obtain also depending on the difficulty level.\n\nThere are diverse minigames you can play like gambling, dating women, developing your own dojo, catch fish and many more.\n\nYou can chose a faction you want to work for and develope the story completely on your actions and decisions. It offers 10 different endings. There are also many job brokers in town or you can ask one of the wandering samurai or townspeople for a job.\n\nYou can chose between many skills and stances or develope your own.  Battles as you can see from screenshots are real time and you can trigger heavy slashes, light slashes, evade or block attacks and grab your enemy to kick or punch him. You also can fight with bare hands.\n\nGraphics are a bit outdated and as mentioned based on the ps3 console but if you like samurai games, the game offers a nice atmosphere. If you already know the prequels of way of the samurai you can be assured that this game includes almost every element you know/ liked plus additional new content. The only thing you might get used to is the style of certain charakters, the game now has many accessiors like funny beards, glasses or characters like female knights and an english girl serving as diplomatic agent which add a bit of an unseriousness to the game. The previous titles in that matter were a bit straight and serious.\n\nService of the publisher is nice and they stay in touch with the community to improve the game experience. Many patches recently have fixed bugs and improved gamecontrolls very well.\n\nIf you collect steam achievements, trading cards and backgrounds, WotS 4 got very great stuff to offer as well.\n\nI was hestitant to buy this game because i already have it on the PS3 but from my side i can say it was worth buying. Thumbs up for a great console to pc port.","July 29, 2015","true","185.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Why? Because it feels like Dead Rising where instead of fighting zombies and psychos, I'm fighting Samurai and psychos. Perhaps I should elaborate. You start out as a ronin, and then you can do whatever until you die or follow the path of one of the endings, and when you die or achieve an ending you keep all your cosmetic items (hair, clothes, etc) Styles and weapons (all weapons not equiped on your character are placed in a storage chest.\n\nAlso, the combat is fun and you can create your own fighting style and lead as an instructor to a dojo (possibly the best part of the game to me) where you can find new students by beating up people on the side of the road (Warning: some people will infact not join your dojo, and just kick you and run to the local authorities because they were just assaulted by some random stranger) and add more fame to your dojo.\n\nOf course, the game does have it's flaws. It is not the easiest thing to just jump in and play and has a bit of a learning curve. There is quite a bit of farming in this game aswell, given the fact you might want to level up a style, get a specific drop, or kill enough enemies for a weapon upgrade. If you are going to run anything thats not a katana or spear build, please note that the weapons to other styles are usually late game or require you to play on a hard or hirakiri difficullty, for example the only fist weapons in the game can only be aquired by playing on a difficullty higher than normal during an event that is near the middle of the story.\n\nOverall I give this game  ^o^/*~*","August 5, 2015","true","75.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a third person action adventure with nice graphics, great music, horrible kb/m controls (you can get used to it or you can use a controller) and some really weird characters.\n\nIt's Ryu ga Gotoku Ishin/Kenzan meeting a Telltale adventure. On a smaller scale. You side with one of the factions and go through several days of key events up to resolution on the last day, which might be as soon as 4th or as late as 7th. The time moves forward whenever you do a main story mission and you can do whatever you want in-between. You can own a dojo, master a huge amount of sword styles, gamble, have fun with the ladies, do some side missions, go fishing or play dress up.\n\nThe main story line, whichever of the 10 endings you go towards, should take around 3 hours. Probably faster on your subsequent playthroughs. And there should be subsequent playthroughs as 10 endings mean you have to complete the game at least 10 times to see them all. As the true ending requires you to complete some very hard boss fights, you might need to complete the game way more times to buff your character (it carries over to the new game). And if you want to 100% this game you're looking at 120-140hrs of grinding. I've completed this more or less five times now, with some grinding done here and there, and after 20+ hours it's still fun. But I like Japan...\n\nI liked:\n* fishing\n* swordfighting\n* graphics (despite clipping everywhere)\n* the Japanese weirdness\n* huge amount of things to unlock\n* it's a samurai game in Japan!\n\nI disliked:\n* some evil stuff that you do on the evil path was... evil\n\nGet this:\n* if you like Japanese weirdness\n* if you like medieval Japan\n* if you like grind\n\nDon't get this:\n* if you're easily offended\n* if you don't like grind","February 14","true","61.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You'd think that you were purchasing the chance to go back in time, so to speak, and change Japanese history on the cusp of the Meiji Restoration, but yet you'll be wishing you could go back in time to change your mind about purchasing this game. Apparently I finished the game without even realizing that I had and to top it off the port, as other reviewers have said, is pretty shoddy.\n\nHow do you make this period of history so boring? Why do we need to grind like we're playing some MMO? Did Michel Therrien design this game? Grind, grind and more grind. You are offered the choice to aid one of three factions - the British, Shogunate or xenophobes - or you could even go your own way, but the game is just so dull and frustrating that you'll never experience any of their storylines. Apparently I finished the game via the independent route without even realizing it. All of a sudden the game just told me that my samurai had become a legend within a highly touted Shogunate militia and left me wondering how I got to that point. What I did experience was just rather dull. Honestly, once the novelty of the loli ambassador wore off, I sort of just went through the motions. Nothing gripped me. I had no connection to the characters, and in an era of Japanese history (world history even) as rich as this, that's just a shameful display.\n\nThe game's description says you can alter the course of Japan's history, but you never feel like you are at any point. I spent more time getting frustrated with how the grind was so unbearable - for example, there is a very short time to grab Dojima's sword at the hospital battle (yep - those special weapons are for a limited time only and you'll spend most of that time trying to pick up the damn things!) and I ended up focusing on that rather than how I was bringing modern medicine to feudal Japan.\n\nBut of course, you'll never get through any of the storylines if you have a keyboard. Don't even bother playing this game with your keyboards. You NEED a controller for this one. The keyboard controls are horrid and the mouse support is barely there. You need to use the keyboard with its crummy control scheme to even do something as simple as navigate the menus. Seriously?\n\nAll this game does is make you wish SEGA would port their Yakuza spinoffs - Kenzan and Ishin (which is set in the same period as this game) - to Steam and play those instead.\n\nAt least I got it on sale. Definately not recommended.","March 23","false","11.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Just Yes. It is fun, with multiple endings, so re-playable. So again YES!\n\n\nEdit: Ok real review. I have been a fan of the series for a long time now, I have played 1 to 4 and I like all of them. The crazy factor is indeed much higher in this game, but if you are a fan of the series I think that is to be expected even 1 had some crazy things in it. Now for newcomers this is going to be a hard sell in my opinion and here is why: Graphics, today almost everyone in the gaming community look at graphics first. This is a warning the graphics will not blow you away it is close to PS2 graphics, but for me that is fine, because I love the gameplay and graphics don't really bother me in any game. Also that 30 FPS BS that I keep on finding here in steam, yes it is 30 FPS but the way the game is built and look it does not matter what so ever. And speaking of Gameplay/style. This is kind of hard for me but I know not everyone will like the Samurai period that the game is in. If you like the samurai era this game is for you (which I am), if not I don't know if you will like this game.\n\nAll in all do I recommend this game? Yes I do, because I am really enjoying it. As my hours played indicated I have logged in a lot of time to this game and I am still playing it.With multiple endings, lots of sword/spear/knuckles to collect, and many styles to master this game for me is really enjoyable. Just give the game a chance and I think you will really enjoy it.","July 26, 2015","true","109.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Locked at 30FPS, no graphics options, etc. Still, the controls aren't too bad although the camera can get a little annoying at times. If those things are enough to deter you from an otherwise fun game, don't play this.\n\nOn the other hand, there's quite a few things to do in this game. You can run your own dojo, learn different fighting styles for swords, spears, and unarmed combat, gamble, and do various quets. You can commit crimes and be an outlaw, or you can be a noble samurai. There's a lot of player choice and replayability involved with this game. It's colorful, and it's a different experience than what most games offer now days.\n\nSimply put this is a fun game, and you will probably have fun playing it.","July 23, 2015","true","14.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Yet this game is capped at 30 and I cannot stay above 21 fps. It makes combat slow, moving around rough and overall the game is unplayable. I played it for 4.5 hours and I can't get a refund, so Im pretty dissapointed with steam.\n\nHowever, it is a jump ahead of way of the samurai 3 in terms of quality, gameplay and story.

This is quite possibly the worst port I have ever played. I tried playing it with my keyboard, and just finally gave up. The control scheme is unresponsive and default mapping is just flat out garbage. Who moved this over to PC and thought that the controls were adequate? Unless you have three arms to hit all necessary buttons at once, you'll likely end up switching around the default key mapping. Problem is, you'll have a nightmare navigating the menus. I didn't even figure out how to back out of a menu with keyboard, as I just lost patience and started using the mouse to manually hit back each time.\n\nAs I said, however, I gave up and ended up attempting to use my PS4 controller. Except it recognizes it as a Xbox controller. Okay, whatever. Let's try mapping the keys. Try putting Light Attack as my Square button. Go into game and Square isn't doing what I assigned it as. I look again, and apparently - even though I assigned it as Square - it sees it as Xbox Controller B. So now my Circle button, is doing Light Attack. To add to the confusion the in-game prompts are still using Xbox controller buttons, when I am currently using the PS4 controller.\n\nUsually with most games, the logic is as follows:\n\nXbox - Playstation\nA - X\nB - Circle\nY - Triangle\nX - Square\nBack - Select\nRB - R1\nRT - R2\n\nHowever, since it's all mixed up, I'm now playing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Simon Says, upside down, while also being blind and deaf. So the fun in the first fight begins.\n\n"Be sure to defend yourself Samurai-san!"\n\nMy block was remapped to R2, which translated to Xbox Right Bumper in the menu, which means it's really R1 now.\n\n"Be sure to mix in heavy attacks!"\n\nHeavy attack was remapped to Circle, which translated to Xbox Y Button, which means it's really Triangle now.\n\n"Use grabs to break through guard!"\n\nGrab consisted of holding block(which remember was remapped to R2 but is now R1 for some reason), and then additionally hitting Xbox Controller X.\n\nI'm not even going to bother trying to decipher this ♥♥♥♥. Top this off with the lack of promised DLC for pre-purchase, the 30 fps lock, and limited resolutions options...Yeah, ♥♥♥♥ that. Thankfully Steam gave me a refund in a shorter amount of time than it took to install this.","July 24, 2015","false","0.4"," 19 of 40 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","19","40","2","4"

First of all you can only be a man? I tried going through the options at the beginning and only having one gender isn't very expansive. Add that with only having maybe 3 things to wear at the beginning, 3 face types, and 3 hairs, and you have yourself the complete opposite of great customization. LOL. I'm all for unlocking stuff, but lord have mercy that is the worst starting options ever.\n\nThe screenies were alright and it seemed like it would be pretty great overall. Wrong. Graphics have amateur problems that are REALLY obvious, even to someone who isn't getting into that kinda thing as a career, the animations and dialogue are sluggish and awful with huge gaps in between each action or person speaking. I liked where the story was going anyways, but then I experienced the god awful fighting system. Now, I'm not saying it's bad because I lost or anything, I actually did quite well with it, winning despite all the issues I saw with it. It was just really so bad I couldn't commit anymore after that.\n\nI ran around a bit afterward. No hud map or anything, which was a little strange. Attempting to follow instructions the beginning cinematic gave to continue the story led to me standing outside some closed gates to the Magistrate (which I was told to immediately go to) with some bots who kept running into the wall and talking about sinks and hair accessories. o_e\n\nI dunno about ya'll, but that is the worst first impression of a game  I have ever seen. Plus it was released in 2011! I'd expect that out of something in the earlier 2000s but after 2010 there's just no excuse for an ugly and poorly designed game like that.\n\n10/10 refunding this stuff.

While it allows mouse suppoer it is a bit of a joke. I.e. wasd to move, right and left click tp attack - IJKO to move the camera about!? And trust me you will need that, the camera does not rotate with you or to where you face at all!\n\nMost of your deaths will be to a person off-screen who you are facing and attacking, but the camera prefers to look over your shoulder at the wall of a house. Attempt to reach the camera keys in time and you'll find the enemy happy to cut you a new throat.\n\nI can only assume it works easier on a controller. Similarly many of the combos and attacks require combinations of joystick movement and attacks, which don't work well on keyboard/mouse. It's a similar problem with Dark souls 2 - where countering was near impossible as it "says" at the same time, but due to keyboard input delay it is not the same time.","August 1, 2015","false","0.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

This mechanic has been broken since inception and should not take up to WOTS5 to be fixed.\n\n\n-moveset saved to character.   Your moveset is no longer tied to which weapon you use in any way.  This has to be the big one for me.  why i gave it a negative review.  In the past, WOTS was a sword collecting game for me.   I would play the game through every possible ending in order to obtain every sword.   Now that movesets tied to your character via skill books, and are obtainable from any random drop, this best feature is removed.  You no longer need to find the ending in which you can kill that elusive gang leader in order to get his awesome sword so that you can finally bust out that jumping spin, because all you gain is......   a fancy hilt for a possibly below average crafted weapon?  booooooo.  terrible change.\n\n-crafting system.  Again, this crafting system furthers the removal of sword collecting.   You obtain moves via skill books dropped by random enemies.  You now disassemble different weapons and then reassemble their mixed parts to make your swords.   These homemade swords are able to have great bonuses if you simply enter and exit the shop menu.  Go ahead and fight almost nobody, and craft yourself an OP weapon.   Difficult to obtain boss weapons not only dont grant you new moves, but the chances that they will hold any useful bonuses is minimal to zero.   broken system.","September 12, 2015","false","50.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

If you want the short of it, you should buy this game for anything under 40 dollars if you'd enjoy an East meets West story with a cool sword building system and branching story. Anyways:\n\nFirstly, the bad. In 33 hours of playing, it has crashed three times which is bad but not terrible (save points are fairly common). The window textures glitch out on my powerful pc, but not catastrophically and they are rarely seen. Control prompts are given in controller buttons, not keyboard buttons, even though once or twice it used keyboard prompts instead when I played, so I think somewhere that isnt working correctly. Finally, the game is short but built for replaying with many New Game+ mode stuff so if you don't want to play it multiple times, you won't enjoy that part.\n\nAs for the good, it is built with a branching story and many events and characters that your choices can seriously effect. Because the game is short, they allowed many permanent choices such as taking quests that allow you to kill various main characters in the three factions, who in turn often have unique weapons. This goes into the New Game plus mode, which is very neat. All gear and fighting styles are carried over game to game, and even some light story elements change (aiding certain characters in previous playthroughs often has them start elsewhere in the world, so you don't have to redo certain sidequests). The combat is fairly fun, but the reality is this is a loot game with an interesting East meets West theme (with zany elements occasionally thrown in that reminds me of Dead Rising). Almost every weapon can be broken down into three parts, and then those parts put back together any way you wish, the end goal being to make the ultimate sword/spear or at least the coolest looking one. Finally, the story while not always the best written is pretty good and interesting, with each branching path coming to a relatively logical and satisfying conclusion (although certain actions are weirdly unoticed, such as killing a faction's guards but still being allowed to take all their quests). This game has many secrets and there are multiple secret missions I still have not been able to do, and pretty much each new path will net you one to five unique swords you otherwise could not get. I really recommend this game.","July 29, 2015","true","51.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though, when 4 was released on consoles, I lost intrest because of the lacking performance. I'd always wished Acquire would seek a publisher to release their titles on PC. But when Ghostlight brought announced WotS4 for PC, having no prior experience with their releases, took the chance many PC gamers take and preordered it. I am not one who supports preorders of digital content, unless there is a benefit like a discount or to show the publisher support. In this case, it was both. The game was heftly discounted and I wanted to show Ghostlight support.

Basically Saint's Row: Samurai Edition.\n\nNow for the long version:\n\nFirst, a foreward- I played Way of the Samurai 4 when it came out for PS3. I didn't love it as much as I did WotS3, but I still got quite a bit of enjoyment out of it. It's goofy as hell with generally absurd characters generally making incredibly poor decisions and quite a few "Oh, Japan" moments (Night Crawling, *cough cough* Melinda Megamelons *cough cough* I think I need some aspirin), sometimes it elicits a chuckle, though since this is a game that has generally short playthroughs and is meant to be replayed many, many times, the humor will pretty soon fall stale, making the skip button your best friend. Since it they are skippable and the Night Crawling, except to unlock a few accessories and other cosmetics is totally avoidable (which is good because it generally feels like a chore), I feel largely lukewarm about all that since the gameplay itself was pretty solid, with swordfights generally being pretty quick exciting affairs, a fair mix of preparation in having the right swords and sword styles, skill, reflexes and a bit of luck in hoping that the computer won't be a cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- which it's usually quite fair until you get to the highest difficulty.\n\nThat being said, the game's got issues. That is to say, bigger issues than the ones mentioned above.\n\nFor me the game at least works, which is more than evidently what I hear a lot of people get out of it with runtime errors at startup that, to be fair, they were (not so much anymore) patching on an almost daily basis. Sometimes the game crashes when I first launch it but that's generally an exception rather than a norm and usually I can get it to run just by opening it again. However, in the game I frequently get sound cut out- for example, during the torture events (which I will come back to), I frequently get NO sound for the whole event, only to have all of that sound play several minutes after the event is over and I'm off doing other stuff; it's a bit ridiculous when I hear my character drowning from the water wheel torture when I'm in the middle of a swordfight.\n\nOn the same note as the torture minigames, during them the game occasionally just refuses any inputs altogether, from both controller and keyboard so I'm just left to die as I can't do ANYTHING as either A) I drown on the waterwheel since I can't hold my breath anymore, B) I get my junk split in half on a flaming steel horse, or C) I get crushed by a large pile of rocks. *sometimes* they work without issue, sometimes it just cuts controller support suddenly but I can still use the keyboard, but probably most often I'm left with nothing and just die because I can't do anything.\n\nEDIT- sometime in the couple of weeks or so since I last played WotS4 they fixed the controller support so now my controller works without issue (at least not that I've noticed so far, but I guarantee it's not ignoring input after EVERY kill like before), so as promised I've changed to a positive review.","August 5, 2015","true","72.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

It's certainly the best I've come across. Probably not for everyone - It's very centred around Japanese history (if you can call it that here) and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's also very difficult. However, the range of things possible to do and the attention to detail in places means that you will probably never get bored of playing it. So far, it is looking like it has the greatest replayability of any game I've played, probably because whenever you complete the game, you can save and go back to the beginning - keeping all of your stats, and potentially all of your items, if you have enough space. I'm not sure when the game was made, but for when I think it was, the graphics are exceptional. Either way, they still stand up to scrutiny right now, and the character design for J.J. especially is very attractive. The game even had a surprising amount of character customisation, allowing you to change your face, body, clothes, weapons, sex, and fighting style - although a lot of that is unlockable once you've already played through once or twice.\nThe one complaint I would have is that the camera movement makes it a little difficult to see at times during fights.\nOther than that, as I said, greatest RPG ever. I'm surprised I hadn't heard of this before since it is much better than any Elder Scrolls game or the like in my opinion.","January 7","true","83.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I already own this game on Playstation (all of the WotS games, actually) and I bought it on Steam in the hopes that it might encourage the developers to release more of these wonderful gems on any platform and especially on Steam.  If you've never played a WotS game, it has some of the most realistic sword combat this side of Bushido Blade.  Instead of the typical sword-fighting game where you simply mash one button continuously to do ridiculous combos, you actually need to use a bit of thought and quite of a bit of timing to be successful here.  The sword moves are almost all very realistic and although combat may seem strage at first, I find it very rewarding in a way that button-mashing sword games will never understand.","March 22","true","36.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically Saint's Row: Samurai Edition.\n\nNow for the long version:\n\nFirst, a foreward- I played Way of the Samurai 4 when it came out for PS3. I didn't love it as much as I did WotS3, but I still got quite a bit of enjoyment out of it. It's goofy as hell with generally absurd characters generally making incredibly poor decisions and quite a few "Oh, Japan" moments (Night Crawling, *cough cough* Melinda Megamelons *cough cough* I think I need some aspirin), sometimes it elicits a chuckle, though since this is a game that has generally short playthroughs and is meant to be replayed many, many times, the humor will pretty soon fall stale, making the skip button your best friend. Since it they are skippable and the Night Crawling, except to unlock a few accessories and other cosmetics is totally avoidable (which is good because it generally feels like a chore), I feel largely lukewarm about all that since the gameplay itself was pretty solid, with swordfights generally being pretty quick exciting affairs, a fair mix of preparation in having the right swords and sword styles, skill, reflexes and a bit of luck in hoping that the computer won't be a cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- which it's usually quite fair until you get to the highest difficulty.\n\nThat being said, the game's got issues. That is to say, bigger issues than the ones mentioned above.\n\nFor me the game at least works, which is more than evidently what I hear a lot of people get out of it with runtime errors at startup that, to be fair, they were (not so much anymore) patching on an almost daily basis. Sometimes the game crashes when I first launch it but that's generally an exception rather than a norm and usually I can get it to run just by opening it again. However, in the game I frequently get sound cut out- for example, during the torture events (which I will come back to), I frequently get NO sound for the whole event, only to have all of that sound play several minutes after the event is over and I'm off doing other stuff; it's a bit ridiculous when I hear my character drowning from the water wheel torture when I'm in the middle of a swordfight.\n\nOn the same note as the torture minigames, during them the game occasionally just refuses any inputs altogether, from both controller and keyboard so I'm just left to die as I can't do ANYTHING as either A) I drown on the waterwheel since I can't hold my breath anymore, B) I get my junk split in half on a flaming steel horse, or C) I get crushed by a large pile of rocks. *sometimes* they work without issue, sometimes it just cuts controller support suddenly but I can still use the keyboard, but probably most often I'm left with nothing and just die because I can't do anything.\n\nEDIT- sometime in the couple of weeks or so since I last played WotS4 they fixed the controller support so now my controller works without issue (at least not that I've noticed so far, but I guarantee it's not ignoring input after EVERY kill like before), so as promised I've changed to a positive review.","August 5, 2015","true","72.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

I already own this game on Playstation (all of the WotS games, actually) and I bought it on Steam in the hopes that it might encourage the developers to release more of these wonderful gems on any platform and especially on Steam.  If you've never played a WotS game, it has some of the most realistic sword combat this side of Bushido Blade.  Instead of the typical sword-fighting game where you simply mash one button continuously to do ridiculous combos, you actually need to use a bit of thought and quite of a bit of timing to be successful here.  The sword moves are almost all very realistic and although combat may seem strage at first, I find it very rewarding in a way that button-mashing sword games will never understand.","March 22","true","36.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember playing it over and over and over again (and dispite hundreds of playthroughs never did get all 5 endings XD)\nThe game evolved so much afer that, trying new things, some of which were brilliant and others of which were *Sad Face,, I liked the old way better ;__;*\nBut GOD YES!\nHaving owned this for a year I was never able to actually play.  Constanty getting "PhysX Init fail"\nFinally was able to solve this with a manual download of the newest PhysX drivers.\nI'm about to dive in now and probably won't come out for a while @_@\n\n*SOLVED 5/18/2016\nAt the moment this game is not working for me.\n~It crashes during the boot up.~\n~I can push "Retry" and then it will launch.  I can watch~\n~The opening clip, but then it crashes before loading any start menu or into the game or w/e is supposed to happen.~\n~I've loved this series since the first game ^_^  (even after about a gagillion playthrough's I never did get all 5 endings XD)~\n~Hope to play soon ^^;~","January 1","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

They ask, “When will he die and be forgotten?” If they come to see me, they don’t say what they are really thinking. They come to gather a little gossip and then go to spread their rumors. Those who hate me whisper about me. They think the worst about me. They say, “He did something wrong. That is why he is sick. He will never get well.” My best friend, the one I trusted, the one who ate with me even he has turned against me.","January 3","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
