I was never in any chess tournaments or clubs. I learned how to play when I was 5. I have been playing casually since, off and on. Since my upgrade from wind 7, (I miss dearly, win 8 & 10 sucks), to 8, then to 10, I lost the standard programs that came with Win 7. Chess  program was one of them. It was simple and easy to play. I bought Fritz 14 due to the lack of any decent chess programs that I was coming/searching across/for. I purchased Fritz 14 and I am not happy with it. It is the most unfriendly interface that I have ever experienced. I can not figure out how to set up games against te computer. I barely able to get a game going against a human (Sending my moves via email to my bro in prison) via emal. I recieve his move via email and I move his piece. This is fine. He is the only one I play. There is so much junk, not explained, junk to me anyways, and it's worse than maze of tangled fishing line. I guess if you love chess, and you are not Einstein, find a simpler chess program. Believe me, this program is not user friendly, I have many, many hours of frustration, and always ends with giving up. Try again a month or so later, still frustrating. The help feature is really bad. You can only enter predermined questions and so you have to settle for a listing that's "Close enough" to what you are asking it. The answer is short vague, and not helpful. Not in my case so far. I have yet to figure how to start a game against the AI. Tons and tons of databases that does not make sence. I just want to play chess, I don't give a crap of games already played, especially by some one else, even if it was Einstien's game or not. Save your money, save your frustrations for something worth being frustrated over, and just settle for a simple, inexpensive chess program. I will have to search again for such. Win 7 version not compatible with win10. After all, check out the number of reviews on Fritz 14 (positive ones), sure, mostly positive, but they are all the Einstiens in the world, and they are only about 40 of them in existance. I am not one of them of course. ;op","December 21, 2015","false","103.7"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","14","19","3","2"

The mileage you get out of Fritz equals the amount of work you put into learning how to utilize its interface.  If you want a simple chess program that is both aestheticly pleasing and fun to play against there are better options than Fritz.  However, if you are looking for a robust program to analyze your chess games in minute detail, Fritz is perfect.\n\nThe built in chess engines are moderately powerful and sufficient for most players.  Deep Fritz 14 is available as DLC if you want an engine that can fully utilize more powerful hardware.  There are also more powerful (and free) engines readily available online that plug into the Fritz GUI with little trouble.  I have personally been using Stockfish 5 and it has been working perfectly.\n\nIf you want to improve your chess game there are few tools I have encountered more valuable than Fritz.","December 23, 2014","true","85.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Awesome online community. Can watch grandmasters games and all tournaments. 6 month playchess/chessbase subscription. Easy chess engine import and implementation. No brainer for anyone who loves to play chess.\n\nCons: Tutorials are hidden and lacking in content . . . (find them in your "C:\Users\[NAME]\Documents\ChessBase\Media files\" folder. Crazy number of options with no documentation. Not really for beginners who wish to learn without playing online (but then again, the best way to learn how to play chess is to . . . play chess, not read books or tutorials).\n\nOverall, the cons are minimal and can be ignored. If someone wants to learn how to play chess, YouTube has a TON of free content. Fritz allows for amazing analysis of games, very large chess database (which is easily expandable via numerous file type support) and online kibbitzing with some of the best players on the planet.\n\nI highly recommend this for anyone who is serious about chess.","October 5, 2014","true","221.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Think of it less as a fancy chess game and more of an analysis tool for chess enthusiasts.\n\nEvery single bad review you'll see for this program is due, not to some defect or bug, but because this is a bloody complex application and it's rather hard to intuit what it is you want to do. Reading through the manual, especially if something doesn't seem to make sense, is highly, *highly* recommended.  If you just want to play chess, and nothing else, you'd be better served by the pack-in games that come with your operating system. The Fritz engine that comes with this software has a low end rating in the 1400s and is absolutely /not/ for beginners!\n\nSo what can you use this for? The killer feature for me is the ability to load up PGN-formatted games (I usually annotate them on my phone) and have the engine go through your game and note where and how you messed up. What you could have done better, and so on, using plain english.\n\nThis is starting to sound like a sales pitch, but in short, I recommend this whole-heartedly if you have more than a passing interest in chess.","November 30, 2014","true","5.3"," 76 of 79 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","76","79","0","0"

The engine itself is separated from the interface which allows for custom engines including {LINK REMOVED} cloud based engines (accessible from within the program).  The included engines are Fritz 11 SE and Fritz 14 (default).  The programs capabilities are wide ranging and far too numerous to completely enumerate here and depending on your expertise you may not exercise many of the features accessible through the interface which brings us to the question, is Fritz Chess worth the price tag?\n\nThe Steam version of Fritz Chess, "Fritz 14", is a single core application as opposed to "Deep Fritz 14" which is multi-core and more expensive.  Therefore, for the price Fritz Chess 14 provides a welcome nominal discount as most non-advanced users will not require nor miss the multi-core support.  The Steam version has single core support but leverages 64 bit Windows natively and thereby provides an optimal experience.\n\nOpening Fritz Chess for the first time, especially if you have not been exposed to such a chess program before and no Chessmaster does not count, can be overwhelming.  As soon as the interface is displayed the player can instantly derive that Fritz Chess is a feature rich, high value chess application.  I'll enumerate the features available just on the "Home" tab.  The other tabs being File, Insert, Board, Training, Analysis, Engine , View and of course everyone's favourite; "Help", which you'll be in dire need of if you ratchet the difficulty too high.\n\n"Home" consists of: Paste Game, Paste Position, Copy Game, Copy Position, New Game, Cancel Move, Replay Move, Move Now, Resign, Offer Draw, Stop Clocks, Infinite Analysis, Blitz Game, Long Game, Levels, Hint, Suggestion, Threat, Coach is Watching, Database, Edit Game Data, Load Next Game, Load Previous Game.  The feature set can be overwhelming to new users though a help file is just a click away, however there is no manual available via the Steam download nor on the store page.  An oversight which should be fast tracked and corrected.\n\nCasual players are in for a real treat as Fritz Chess will no doubt help you improve your game.  Under the Training tab there are a wealth of training options such as but not limited to Opening and Endgame Training though I would like to elaborate on two additional modes.  The first, Handicap and Fun which is essentially as the name implies, a handicap mode.  This mode consists of many sliders such as Playing Strength but more importantly Fritz Chess comes equipped with a multitude of pre-sets ranging from Careless and ♥♥♥♥♥ to the upper tier opponent skills known in the program as Steam Roller and Assassin (misspelled in the program's interface as Assasin).  These pre-sets can be individually fine tuned allowing the player enormous flexibility.\n\nThe second option, Friend Mode is more of an adaptive artificial intelligence that consistently always plays just somewhat better than the player.  Combine these modes (or just plain old New Game) with the ability to turn on the program's help system allowing for the display of recommended moves (and moves not to make) plus a comprehensive database of more than 1.5 million games and you have an extraordinary learning tool.\n\nTo answer my opening question, yes, Fritz Chess is a good value and Fritz Chess is not only a tool that you can learn from but given it's engine customization features it is a tool that will grow with you as well.\n\nEdit: Sept 22, 2014 - The multiprocessor engine is now available as dlc.","July 6, 2014","true","37.0"," 66 of 77 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","66","77","0","13"

While Frtiz 14 program on steam has had its fair share of issues, they seem to be mostly fixed now, so what do you get with the steam version of fritz 14?\n\nYou get Fritz 14 GUI\nFritz 14 (single core engine)\nfritz 11 SE (also single core)\ncrafty 23.05 (multi core engine)\nVideo beginner courses\nFritz 14 opening book (weighing in at 449 mb (not sure how many openings)\n2013 database weighing in at 809mb and has nearly 3 million games\nlets check database (subscription based)\nand 6 months access to Premium membership to Playchess.com,\n\nSo for those wondering the difference between this version on steam and deep fritz, well the engine on the steam version is single core only, (apart from crafty) hence the lower price, otherwise I think there is no difference.\n\nOne thing I should point out is, while I do recommend the software, I don't recommend it for those new to chess, learning the basics, there are better ways to learn chess, Fritz is aimed at those that already have skill with the game, and want to go farther. So if you are a rank beginner and hope that Fritz will teach you the basics,, basic tactics and want good tutorials, I would look else where.\n\nWhile Fritz does have training modes like Friends mode (which auto adept to your strength and play style), Handicap and fun, some opening and end game tutorials (as well as a few others) sparring mode that you can set the level 1400 up to 2480 and handicap position (removes pieces from the board) there are a few other modes too.\n\nthere are a few visual help options like spy, opening hints and so on.\n\nThen we have a very powerful features of Frtiz, Full analysis mode and blunder check, (also have a infinity analysis mode too)\n\nTwo feature I just noticed, Fritz can also play chess 960 (where the chess pieces are randomly placed and with some extra rules) and givaway chess, (you are forced to capture any attacked pieces) these modes can be fun and access by the little down arrow on new game in the home tab)\n\nYou have a lot of options, so describing them all would take a lot of work. I'm only really covering the main features.\n\nOne thing I must mention is the extremely poor help file, it's just plain horrible, and doesn't really explain all the features of Fritz that well, even the PDF file seems to be more cut and paste from help file or vice versa, so some features (or many) might leave you head scratching on their purpose. So when you do start using the program, I highly suggest you check out videos done by Steve Lopez, as his videos have allowed me to understand a lot of features which would otherwise be unexplained or never used.\n\nanother aspect I will mention, Fritz does support UCI (Universal Chess Interface) engines, (free and commercial) so you can easy add more engines of your choice, (stockfish for example (which is free)\n\nI think I will wrap it up by saying, I think the program deserves an 8 /10, but you should only get it if you know chess pretty well, but you also should only get this version if you not got a recent version of Fritz, as you may not see that many differences, (feedback from other players who have owned Fritz 13)\n\nso after that, I don't think I have much else to add.","July 17, 2014","true","13.8"," 44 of 51 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","44","51","0","0"

While I'd like to consider myself a decent Chess player, I admit I still have much to learn of the game, such as end game calculations, mass attack and defense strategies, and how to not accidentally spill coffee on my chessboard while I play.\n\nAlthough I haven't found any tools or tips for coffee related checkmates, (Coffee Temperature Gauge, Player Motor Skills vs. Reaction Timing Graph, Coffee Cup Center of Gravity Chart, Coffee Stain Probability Meter, Estimated Remaining Time of Cleanup, etc.) I believe this program is a substantial learning and teaching tool.\n\nIn essence, this software is great for improving your game and playing techniques, or even teaching them if you enjoy being a Chess tutor. While you can indeed play a simple game of Chess with Fritz 14, it offers a great deal more than that, from multimedia files that explain the rules of the game as well as rated and timed matches, to differing analysis tools that suggest blunders, better moves and checkmate threats, to even more tools including subtle hints and showing every single possible move and the advantages and disadvantages of each.\n\nI would like to warn potential buyers of Fritz 14, it can be very complex and intimidating to learn all of the programs offerings. I'm not questioning intelligence here but rather pointing out that Fritz 14 truly does go the distance in terms of analysis tools and options, and the time it may take to learn them can frustrate and be off-putting. However, in my opinion, once you learn how it all functions and how you can best use or customize the tools to your liking, it is that much more at your disposal. So, while figuring it all out can be an arduous task to master, I personally think it pays off in the long run, especially for anyone whom is seriously trying to learn and best the challenges that make Chess what it is.\n\nThe core game offers several types of 2D and 3D boards, not a considerable amount, but a few. A player can customize the pieces of the set, the board color and style, as well as the background table the board is set on. This is also the first Chess program I've played that offers 3D opponents that can move the pieces with their hands. While I prefer a simpler 2D Chessboard myself, I find the 3D opponents to be an interesting concept, and I certainly appreciate creativity.\n\nFrom what I understand, the game also comes with a six month subscription to the PlayChess.com website, which offers news, training, a dedicated server for online matches, and likely a good deal more, all revolving around, of course, Chess. I must admit I tend to be a very esoteric individual (I have Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) and I have not played online. I would have to imagine the community at PlayChess.com is a positive, intelligent and friendly one, however, this is purely my own speculation. All I can honestly say is "Multiplayer" is not really my scene, so by all means, click the web link and check it out if you are interested.\n\nTo conclude my review, I would personally recommend it happily to any player looking to go from being a good Chess player to a great one, from a hobby player to a pro player, or even an inexperienced player to a rather competent player. With patience and a bit of mindful dedication, this program offers a considerable deal of training content and much more. However, if you would rather simply enjoy a Chess game or two, there are much less complex, not to mention cheaper, alternatives to Fritz Chess 14.\n\nAnd I personally recommend caution with certain...malicious...cups of coffee.\n\nGood luck and happy gaming!","April 1, 2015","true","221.4"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","18","19","3","0"

This is also the only chess software that is available through Steam that takes itself seriously. So you don't have many options anyways. I bought this on Steam sale when it was $19.99 and $9.99 for "64 bit dlc".\n\nYou probably would only use the latest Fritz 14 engine, so basically you get one good engine and two old ones. There is a ton of included games from history from all the famous players. They can be searched by all criteria like years, last names, etc. There are many analysis options. You can see suggested moves on the go or analyse the whole game. One nice feature is intentionally vaguely worded hints. They give enough descriptive advice but don't directly give you the best move. You have an option for exact moves though.\n\nWhile the core of the game is pretty good. But it is really puzzling how a known chess software maker can make a good engine and not take the effort to include more options in its main selling point which is the 2D and 3D representation of the chess board. You get very few options for the 2d chess board. There are nice wooden texture and tones included, but there are just five total! It doesn't even have the green and white traditional vinyl board colors that many players are used to. Doesn't have solid color options. You get too few chess graphics as well, and only 3 out of 5 are any good. The other two are abstract designs no one would use.\n\nThe 3d chess board graphics look nice but they look like they've been made very lazily. For example you get a number of options for traditional 3d pieces and boards but they can only be combined with solid color background. You can adjust something as insignificant as lighitng and reflection, but don't get many texture options for the background. The themed 3d graphics with backgrounds are pretty good, but they're mainly for novice players. In my opinion the experienced players would not bother running these nice looking 3d graphics since they are used to plain 2d diagram.\n\nSo basically I'd give it a 7 out of 10. You get lots of advanced options but not enough color and graphics variation. I'd even be willing to purchase additional ones as DLC if they were available. But there aren't any. Seems like such a missed opportunity to simply add more colors and graphics options. The only explanation I can think of is lazyness.\n","July 31, 2015","true","5.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

I was never in any chess tournaments or clubs. I learned how to play when I was 5. I have been playing casually since, off and on. Since my upgrade from wind 7, (I miss dearly, win 8 & 10 sucks), to 8, then to 10, I lost the standard programs that came with Win 7. Chess  program was one of them. It was simple and easy to play. I bought Fritz 14 due to the lack of any decent chess programs that I was coming/searching across/for. I purchased Fritz 14 and I am not happy with it. It is the most unfriendly interface that I have ever experienced. I can not figure out how to set up games against te computer. I barely able to get a game going against a human (Sending my moves via email to my bro in prison) via emal. I recieve his move via email and I move his piece. This is fine. He is the only one I play. There is so much junk, not explained, junk to me anyways, and it's worse than maze of tangled fishing line. I guess if you love chess, and you are not Einstein, find a simpler chess program. Believe me, this program is not user friendly, I have many, many hours of frustration, and always ends with giving up. Try again a month or so later, still frustrating. The help feature is really bad. You can only enter predermined questions and so you have to settle for a listing that's "Close enough" to what you are asking it. The answer is short vague, and not helpful. Not in my case so far. I have yet to figure how to start a game against the AI. Tons and tons of databases that does not make sence. I just want to play chess, I don't give a crap of games already played, especially by some one else, even if it was Einstien's game or not. Save your money, save your frustrations for something worth being frustrated over, and just settle for a simple, inexpensive chess program. I will have to search again for such. Win 7 version not compatible with win10. After all, check out the number of reviews on Fritz 14 (positive ones), sure, mostly positive, but they are all the Einstiens in the world, and they are only about 40 of them in existance. I am not one of them of course. ;op","December 21, 2015","false","103.7"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","14","19","3","2"

The mileage you get out of Fritz equals the amount of work you put into learning how to utilize its interface.

However, if you are looking for a robust program to analyze your chess games in minute detail, Fritz is perfect.\n\nThe built in chess engines are moderately powerful and sufficient for most players.  Deep Fritz 14 is available as DLC if you want an engine that can fully utilize more powerful hardware.  There are also more powerful (and free) engines readily available online that plug into the Fritz GUI with little trouble.

This is a 40 dollar piece of software. The graphics are from dos 3.2 . My Windoes 98 software was far better(Power chess). The game locks up like nobodies business. This is one bad game. Thank you Steam for the refund> I'll try to buy again someday","July 11, 2015","false","1.9"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

You can get up to 64bit multi-core Engine capabilities via DLC, but VERY few will actually need this.\n\nThe interface is Identical to Houdini Pro 8, but the engine is off course Fritz 14 instead of the Houdini 8 Engine.\nI use and enjoy both.\n\nRecommended for serious players!","May 28, 2015","true","209.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
