The host of this one is Cookie Masterson, heavily considered the most popular host of the series. However, it's not my favorite. It's still the classic YDKJ formula, which isn't bad since you get to choose your categories, the later Volume 4: The Ride, 5th Dementia, and YDKJ 2011 all outshine it. It's still a fun game, what with the Three-Way Question and Impossible Questions. DO pick this one up.","April 5, 2014","true","3.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"
