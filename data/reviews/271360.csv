It's a resource-management game that gives you the opportunity to create stuff from resources and sale it in your stores. It's your job to organize the location of your factories and stores, plan lines of productions, set prices, watch surrounding cities growing and plan your logistics.\n\nIt's a re-release of an older game, so don't expect high end graphics or fancy animations. The only thing you will hear, are some simple effects and different background music, which you will turn off at a certain point.\n\nIf you like games like Transport Giant, OpenTTD or Capitalism 2 then you should take a look at it.\n\nThe problem with this game is a technical one. Actually, there's more than one problem. First, like the retail version it seems to have trouble with every graphic processor that is not from stone age and as long as you run a newer modell, the game won't even start. You can prevent this, by starting it in windows comp mode (WinXp or earlier). Second, right now there seems to be a problem with some Win10 systems. The problem should be known by the dev team now and if the publisher wouldn't have a history of non-delivered patches, I could be optimistic. Third, there're some glitches and flickering that may occur under particular circumstances. Best advice to get rid of that, would be closing all programs you don't need at the moment of playing the game.\n\nOk, there have been games with bigger problems and patching a game after release to make it more stable seems to be a common practice at the present time. But this case is different: These problems were known for years, long before the new dev team kicked in. I'm asking: Where is quality assurance? Did they do any Beta tests? If you buy this game now, you give the dev-team and the publisher a big advance for work there is still to do, to make this game consumer-friendly. Question is: Will they do it, if they hadn't done it in past?\n\nThere is a very high chance, that if you buy this game now, you will have some kind of issue, but the good news is, that these issues are known to the community, waiting years for a stable version of this game. So in most cases there will be some sort of fix. The game itself is a economic goldie. If you get it running on your system, you will have a lot to enjoy. A smoothly rising difficulty, endless maps and maybe they will add a working multiplayer to it, but even without there are plenty of gaming hours to play.\n\nI recommend this game to people interested in economic simulation or logistic games, being aware of the technical issues. Waiting a few weeks, taking an eye on possible updates, is also a good idea.","August 14, 2015","true","9.3"," 128 of 138 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","128","138","3","5"

Selecting moving vehicles can be a pain as well and so selecting your trucks from the vehicle status menu is advised.\nUnlike many of the transport tycoon simulators out there, IG2 lets you manage the production of goods from start to finish. Each factory, mine, farm, refinery and so on, have their own production levels which change depending on the availability of resources. In other words, a ranch in grasslands produces more milk than one on a beach. This makes production more complicated as you add more stages of manufacturing before reaching a final product but the financial rewards are worth it. You also get to set the price of the products and place your stores in key locations to manage demand. Always make sure the demand is slightly higher than supply to prevent buildups of unsold goods in your storage areas. You can also export goods overseas for a reduced profit but the demand is always high. The range of goods available to export is slim though, conversely you can import goods for a higher price but without the hastle of producing it yourself.\nAs the game goes on you unlock a vast range of products and vehicles from inflatable dinghies to luxury cars. The number of options is impressive but may leave players feeling overwhelmed with choices that often won't make much difference.\nOne area the game does disappoint I feel is the transport side, although you can choose from lorries, trains, planes and ships there are few circumstances where the lorries aren't the best option, even over large distances. You don't get to set their route either so you can't choose to avoid a busy downtown area in lieu of the empty country road you just built. With trains you do get to choose which tracks to take, but you don't get to choose which platform they use and with a maximum of 2 tracks in and out of each station (2 per side if the trains turn around rather than passing through) bottlenecks at your large stations are an issue that has long since been solved on other transport sims.\n\nIt is disappointing that this remains one of the best games in the genre, it is a good game certainly, but there are lots of little issues you feel would not exist if they remade the game today. I would also advise caution when buying as it will not play on many computers. I have owned six PCs over the years and this game has only worked on two of them. This version does appear to work better than the original with the Nvidia patch, but do not be surprised if you have to ask for a refund. It's a shame that such a classic can't be enjoyed by a wider audience.\n\n(It works for me on an Nvidia GTX 970 and on my GTX 770, both on Windows 10, since the issues seems to be graphics related you should be OK with either of these)","August 14, 2015","true","3.1"," 48 of 61 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","48","61","4","1"

Lots of transportation options.\n- Very little guessing with the products. Lots of graphs and statistics tell you exactly how much of a product will be produced and consumed at each factory/store. This really helps optimizing.\n- In-game wiki describes each product, where it is made, where it is sold, and what it takes to make.\n\nCons:\n- Graphics are outdated (early 90s sprites). This doesn't really bother me a ton, but it could bother others.\n- You never miss something until it's gone: the interface is outdated. Specifically, there is no time dilation (faster/slower) or pause. There is no view rotation which can make hooking up roads/rails difficult.\n- The range of their buildings should be rebalanced. I find myself constantly either kicking myself or just taking dynamite to things because they are just out of range. Often by just one or two squares.\n\nNitpicks:\n- They skimped on their English translator. You get the gist of what they're conveying, but it is off-putting. Names aren't exact so if you look for one thing, it's often called something else (though similar enough).\n- Trains need brains. Even with two rails, they often go down the same side and slow each other down.\n\nEdit: Found on the forums that + increases speed and - decreases. "P" will pause. Still marking them down for not showing key bindings in the options or something. Who knows what other keys I'm missing?","November 28, 2015","true","56.1"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","1"

Got it back when I was a kid.\nThe box version would not run on modern PCs, but this steam version does run. I had only one crash. I guess the Devs did an ok job on remastering the game.\n\nThe game sets you up in a role of an entrepeneur, you decide what your company will produce and sell. Sadly there is no simulation of inter-company trade.\nEg. You could focus on being a supermarket.\nYou grow your own fruit orchard, have a dairy farm, and makes wine to sell in your own chain of stores.\nYou adjust prices of your goods and the demand-supply curve will adjust to your price. City grows overtime as you open new types of stores in the city (growth is VERY slow).\nYou must control all three sectors of business (Produce. Manufacture, and Retail) and also manage logistics for your goods.\n\nIt is good to play in campaign mode, deadlines forces you to make difficult choices, as your finances are limited and must be used in the most efficient manner. Eg. Would I set up a new production line (costs millions) next to a big city or would I buy a new cargo ship to supply that huge city across the map with goods made elsewhere? Would the transport cost break even or make a good return on investment?\nMy advice is to start slow and do not grow too fast.\n\nThe system is fairly simple when you get used to the quirky controls of the game.\nWarning: The ESC button returns you to the main menu.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.5/10\n\nIt's a good simulator, but it's not the best.\nIt's a good test of macro management skill.\nIt does not promote varying play-style, you will find one working formula and probably stick to it.","August 14, 2015","true","9.3"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","18","24","0","0"

I owned this on disc many years ago, and I have not been disapointed with this re-release, which enables you to run the game in full HD.

I would advise those individuals to try again with the latest verison as a couple of patches have been released since launch.\n\nBefore starting the campaign, I recommend completing the three tutorial missions.

However, I remember playing the original game for many hours and finding it highly enjoyable.\n\nIn summary, highly recommend for those who have not experienced Industry Giant II before and for those fond of the original game who have always wanted a version that would work on a modern PC in full HD.\n","August 29, 2015","true","26.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

Micromanagement is also a big deal in this game. If you ever wanted to create your own business while experience freedom of choice in finally doing it, you're gonna love this game.\n\nIndustry Giant 2 on Steam is a HD version of the classic game made in the early 2000s. It works perfectly fine on Win7 and I guess it does also on Win8 and above.\n\nThe game itself contains several campaigns with different difficulties and also a tutorial of how to play the game. Of course there is still a sandbox-mode without any goals where you can just run your enterprise. You start between 1900 and newer dates and can experience everything that comes with it: technologic advantages and possibilities. For example if you start in 1900 most of your business might be farming and stuff, while in the 50's you can produce sunmilk, boats, vendingmachines, bottles and other stuff.\n\nThe only thing I really dislike is the fact that you can't switch to the optionsmenü during the game. If you press ESC the game will end while creating an automatic savefile and will then show you the mainmenu where you can change your graphic and audio options. This can be annoying sometimes.\n\nThe price itself for such an old game is pretty high, despite the unique high quality it has for a business simulation game if you compare it with newer ones (which do not exist, sadly). You should buy it during a sale or if it's included in the Humble Bundle or something similar.","February 29","true","3.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

The fact is, on some PC's it runs better than on others. From what I've heard about the developers, these various bugs may or may not get fixed. However, my PC runs the game just fine, and, to me, it is very playable and enjoyable in its current state. I would suggest buying the game and, if you have problems with it, simply return it. As I've seen, there seems to be no way to tell if the game will run on your system or not. It's not all NVidia graphics cards, which I use, its not later versions of windows, I'm currently on 10. Just try the game out and hopefully you can get the unique experience that I've been looking for in a game for a long time.\n\nThe game itself reminds me of Anno in that you have to set up production chains and turn products into other products. What was missing for me from Anno was the ability to just focus on the business aspect of the game. No diplomacy, no ecobalance, just making products. Now to be fair, I am a nerd. I like to see efficiency and to make small numbers get larger. If you don't like working with numbers, this game might not be for you. I for one like looking at my cow farm and deciding that I can run it at 75% efficiency to supply demand, or making the perfect ratio of wheat farms to donut factories. Hopefully the developers will keep their promises, fixing bugs and even adding multiplayer. I've even heard talk of a sequel, so I would be very excited to see a modernazation of this classic.","August 16, 2015","true","8.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

There are a couple of fixes mentioned on the forum that seem to work for most people, but be aware that you'll probably have to spend 5 or 10 minutes getting the game to work, as I had to do as well. This is an old game after all (released 2002), and wasn't developed to be compatible with our modern hardware.\n\nThe game itself is what I consider somewhat of a classic. Even though the Jowood games catalogue consists of relatively obscure titles like Traffic Giant, Transport Giant, and Hotel Giant, I think they have made some of the greatest classic tycoon-genre games ever made (apart from the *real* classics of course - you know which ones I mean).\n\nIG2 combines goods transportation (similar to their other game Transport Giant) with industry and production management, and the result is a pretty fun game that, even though it shows its age in a number of places, will keep fans of the genre entertained for a decent amount of time.\n\nTo me it's worth its current discounted price (12€), to get to play a more or less "fixed up" version of a game that I used to play a lot of. Without the nostalgia I would probably find it just a bit overpriced, especially the full price (15€) I think is pushing it for an old game like this.

No issue for me, so can't comment on them.","August 21, 2015","true","20.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Now, it runs without the crashing and graphic issues which other reviewers report.\n\nNever the less, it was very easy for me to adjust to the game's low frame rate, only took a minute or two. The game itself is very enjoyable, it has a good selection of production, sale and transport methods to begin with, a nice early game, the mid game introduces much more complicated production chains, which you can however ignore if you prefer simpler production chains. As of writing this review, I have not gotten to the late game yet.\n\nI would also not be too quick in comparing it with OpenTTD, as some reviewers seem to do. The similarities between the games are merely that they are 2D isometric games which feature vehicles. The base game of OpenTTD focuses on transporting one of about 10 different goods with very simple production chains, this game features complex production chains and much more flexible vehicles, which allow you a much greater ability to plan efficient routes (For example a truck can transport one good one way and another the other way)\n\nOverall I think you should try the game out. As other reviewers pointed out, there is the chance it might not run on your computer, however if that proves to be the case you can just take advantage of Steam's refund policy.","August 20, 2015","true","3.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

I have loved this game ever since it came out 13 years ago and was really disappointed when even with all the online fixes, patches and workarounds I could find, I could not get it to work on my new pc or laptop.\n\nI emailed the devs last year who said they were working on a version that would work with modern day computer's and their operating systems, but did not see anything further.\n\nThen yesterday I see it drop on steam and immediately by it whilst it was on sale at £8 and I was upset to learn it still wouldn't work. Read some forums and tried a few workarounds including various different compatibility modes, but no dice.\n\nI shut down my pc and rebooted and just as I was about to send an email to the devs, venting my frustration and requesting assistance or an eta on a fix, I decided to boot the game again (with no compatibility modes turned on), so that I could get the error code and Boom, worked first time and worked flawlessly all evening last night.\n\nSo to all who buy this game wanting it to work, try the workarounds, shut down and reboot your pc to try and make it work, you never know your luck. The fact it does work though on my PC which has an overlocked i7, GTX 780 ti, Windows 7 pro 64 bit, shows that there has been progress in making this game compatible with modern day PCS.\n\nUnfortunately it does appear that its not universally working so yes its a risk, but if you played this game in the past and enjoyed it as much as I did, its worth the risk especially with the steam refund policy that now exists.","August 17, 2015","true","8.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","0"
