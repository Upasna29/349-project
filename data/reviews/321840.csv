"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathschosen/recommended/321840/","deathschosen","[Pax] Kregard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathschosen/","526 products in account","TL:DR\nThis is a visual novel and not a game. You make a few major choices at the climax to drive it to a specific conclusion. The story is short so you can finish within one sitting, that is if you are into reading. If the music annoys you, feel free to mute. If you do not like ramblings, then skip straight to pro and con list below.\n\n\nDon't let the negative comments get you from downloading this free game. It is known that story based "games" are not for everyone. Granted, when I first downloaded this game I was hoping for more then just dialogue and a few choices here and there. I stuck with it, however, and wanted to see where I would end up. I ended up following a story that goes further then just the stoic version of the protagonist which quickly breaks down later. Game critiques do what game critiques do, play for 10-20 minutes and base their critique off that short amount of time. Not trying to bash critiques as they are completing their objective the way they see fit. I on the other hand went through the entire game before making my critique.\n\nPros\nAbout 1-2 hour story, so does not drag on forever (will be continued in further installments like a book in a series).\nMajor choices at the end of the game, driving the final product.\nLimited artwork so you concentrate more on the story (sorry, I come from a generation that cares more for words then             pretty pictures so be forewarned).\nNew age of openness by being gay within the story without being subjected to fan service art.\nMusic is astounding, however can become repetitive which leads me to my next pro.\nFull set of options including fullscreen, audio control, and having the text auto advance if you do not want to be bothered by clicking.\nCons\nLimited choice selection, although major decisions towards the end.\nNot really a game\nScenes repeat which may be boring for those interested more in art.\nStory is a bit shallow at the beginning.\nCharacter development for one of the characters is brought forth too rapidly ruining some of the mystery of the story.\nAs a pun on the story and my conclusion, I let my heart decide my course of action and it led me to my desired ending.","September 12, 2014","true","5.4"," 251 of 294 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","251","294","0","0"

I liked it.\n+ Meaningful choices\n+ A complete adventure in a space ship.\n+ Varied cast of characters.\n+ Interesting story and setting.\n+ The protagonist is a gamer.\n\n\n- Some characters are either unbelievable or plain irritating. Three of them would be booted off the ship immediately if there was even a slightly intelligent command officer on board. Some types of conduct are absolutely unacceptable on a warship during an actual war, even if a character is quirky, endearing or competent. Especially ONE character has no place in her position, and it frankly shatters my suspension of disbelief to pieces.\n- The big bad is so glaringly obvious. Also, that person is so hilariously incompetent at what it does, making any attempts at spying or sabotage ridiculous. But they work... The crew is very special, you see.\n- One choice in the game feels VERY contrived. It's either go stupid good or reasonably evil. Then, other characters react... in a completely unbelievable way.\n\n\nFinal verdict:\n\nDespite some glaring flaws in character development, this visual novel is engaging. Sure, most of the crew's reactions are unbelievable, but it's still better than in most Hollywood films. Artwork, music, plot hovewer, make this a good and a fun experience. I recommend.\n\n","August 23, 2015","true","4.5"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","38","43","4","0"

Have to admit, I don't do many Visual Novels. They aren't really "games" in the same since most people think of when hearing the word. If anything, I always think of them as "Interactive Picture Books". Which I don't think if a bad thing, I may not have played many Visual Novels, but I have played enough to where I can say that I know a good one from a bad one. And I've played bad ones. And this... is not one of them. It's a fantastic story actually, that kept me going all the way to the end in one sitting. I didn't stop till the it was over, and it was a very well done V.N. With some very miner grammar mistakes here and there, but to be honest, I don't think there is a single one I've read that didn't have at least a couple grammar errors. They did stick out, but nothing that really pulled me out of the story enough to be much of a bother. The story it's self is far from original, but that's not really a bad thing as long as it's told well. And this one is told very well. Honestly surprised a V.N. that is a free download would be this good. It actually reads more like a science fiction book than the more classic romanticized stories I typically come across when looking at these kind of "games". It's actually pretty refreshing to see one done in this way.\n\nThe characters in this V.N. are all pretty colorful people. Maybe a bit stereotypical. but honestly there is nothing wrong with using classic stereotype characters, like the tsundere girl who act's superior to everyone, as long as these characters are used in the right way. And I personally believe they are here. Every character, be the a stereotype or not, fits into their respective role perfectly. Anyone who is a fan of Visual Novels, would probably like this one. I'm not even all that big on these kind of things, but I like it quite a lot. One of the best I've read even. And I wish the creators the best of luck in their efforts to make a sequel, cause I do want to know how the story ends with everyone in the story.\n\nHaving said all that, the main issue I think anyone who already knows what to expect from a V.N. is going to have is the reader's ability to direct the flow of the story. Or rather the lack there of. It's kind of an important part of any V.N. to have reader choices that have a large part in controlling where and how events will happen, be they for better or worse. This story, as much as I like it, is a lot more linear than what I would like it to be. However I did read from the makers of this novel's kick starter that they plan to fix this in the next installment of the story, which I would love to read by the way. Giving readers more power over the protagonists actions and building or breaking relationships between your crew members. With that in mind, I do believe that is a worth while effort to support them in their kick starter, and help bring the next chapter to life. Those are my thoughts on this Novel, and my hopes for the next one.","October 12, 2014","true","9.3"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","28","30","0","0"

I hesitate to say game because it's not one.  It is a visual novel.  It has some interactive parts that let you make choices at times that may or may not influence then ending, but there is no "gameplay."  Some of them are obvious and some aren't.  All of them effect the story a little bit in what you get to read, whether it has an impact on the plot or not.  If you're looking for a sim rpg then move on.  The closest thing I can compare this to is the "choose your own path" books.  I've only gotten one ending so far, but I absolutely plan on playing through again and checking out the other paths.  If your looking for a fun story this is great.  Either way I recommend at least taking a look at.  I look forward to the sequel, and I look forward to reading the prequel Rising Angels: The Red Rose.\n\nOn a slight side note, the sequel I mentioned will take into account the complaints about "lack of interaction" and will be pushing more into gameplay with two modes: story mode and "investigation mode."  Because of this, I highly recommend reading this, even if it's not your favorite type of thing.  If you don't you'll be missing out on a lot of backstory when Rising Angels: Fates is released.","September 15, 2014","true","4.7"," 36 of 50 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","36","50","0","0"

If you wish to know more about the world and backstory you can get the first novel, Rising Angels: The Red Rose, as well as other games kind of set in same universe directly from developer's website: http://www.idhasstudios.com/?page_id=19\n\nI played Rising Angels: Reborn before and wrote a small review back then. Republishing it here with small changes.\n\n---------------------\n\nI applaud to the artist who did character sprites - he or she had to work with the relatively big cast of nine characters and did a marvellous job. Each character identified by distinct silhouette using different body shapes, poses and features like ears, horns and wings. Sprites utilize poses and body language to convey information about the person, like Zuri is almost always shown in positions that imply motion or Stan often drawn covering his mouth with his hand in a gesture subconsciously associated with lying. I think wings were superfluous for character's design - they take too much screen space and people who have wings could be easily recognized without them - but it looks like each race appearances were already defined in earlier novel drawn by another artist and it's too late to change something now.\n\nIn contrast to character sprites backgrounds look nice and clean, but also grey and unimpressive and there is too few of them, but it's understandable because most of action happens on board of a small spaceship. Game could definitely use more CGs as well; few CGs present are somewhat bland and characters appear noticeably different from their usual sprites. Also, if story takes place on a spaceship, it's almost necessary to show how this ship looks from outside, but I guess nobody in development team could do mechanical design.\n\nMusic clearly was professional - it sounded like something I could hear before in some games or movie trailers. Perhaps it was licensed from some recording studio. Any sound effects are sadly missing. Adding little sound: footsteps, gunshots, "woosh" of spaceship door would only help immersion.\n\nThe list of races itself is more what I expect to see in some Star Trek fanfic written by a schoolgirl, not standalone serious work of science fiction: generic fantasy races, angels and demons, furry people - all together in space. Just like in Star Trek, critically important ship personnel are sent with away teams to investigate dangerous planets, apparently unarmed. At least no officers were killed during planetary missions, despite all of them except one wearing red shirts.\n\nHowever, even if Rising Angels series started as mere fanfic, it came a long way and Reborn deserves being distributed through Steam.","September 12, 2014","true","0.4"," 30 of 44 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","30","44","0","1"

It has heart.  And the core plot is kind of interesting--there's some decent SF in there.  There's certainly an ambition to explore the characters, what makes them tick and so on.  And I like the art.  The controls worked pretty well although occasionally I wished for a "back" button to look at the previous dialogue again.\nBut if you're expecting anything like realism, expect again.  I just find it incredibly hard to believe in these people as anything resembling military personnel.  Half of them I find hard to believe in as adults capable of dressing themselves.  The main character herself is the least bad, but even her, while I find her emotional arc somewhat affecting, just systematically breaks her original image as someone who supposedly graduated first in her class and is remotely competent.  Not even the whiz she imagines herself to be at the beginning, just borderline capable of seeing things obvious as the nose on her face or taking basic operational security precautions.\nSo for instance (really major spoiler here)\nWe have the doctor, who she suspects of being an enemy spy, who has repeatedly tried to hamper the mission and given signs of knowing things he should not.  In his sickbay is a crewmember who has been poisoned.  He has pretended to have nothing to treat her with, until pressured by people who knew what was in his supplies.  She should have had him arrested for gross dereliction of duty so she could (a) make sure he didn't nobble the crewmember and (b) search his quarters and sickbay for incriminating evidence.  Instead she lets him continue treating this woman and goes off and forgets the whole thing.  What on  earth?!\nThis kind of thing happens time after time, losing the thread or not bothering to follow up on clues or failing to spot or foresee the obvious.  Often because she's busy wallowing in self-pity, something she and some other crewmembers do at the drop of a hat, often just seconds after they've been given an uplifting pep talk and sworn renewed resolve.  And yet it's appropriate for her to be the heroine because despite these flaws she remains the most competent, level-headed person on the ship.  That's because most of the remainder of the crew are unbalanced and self-absorbed to the point of serious mental illness.  It boggles my mind that on a military vessel, over the course of the whole story I don't think anyone except the main character ever just does what they're told without a bunch of back-chat.\nDo I recommend this game?  Is there a "maybe" button?  It was kind of fun, and "free" is an awfully attractive price point.  But I constantly wanted to yell at the screen.  And the characterization had possibilities but after laying it on with three or four trowels they seem to have decided that wasn't getting it done and went for the back-hoe.  In the end, I'll recommend it; it's worth more than they're charging.","September 15, 2014","true","6.1"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","3"

And whom you shouldn't trust?'' This is a very mature topic in an even more mature story. So if you expect the choices to answer this question to be as Black and White as the ''Side with the Rebels against the Evil Tyrant, or side with the Evil Tyrant to crush the Rebels.'', then move along; you won't like this VN. But if you like plot full of mystery and doubt, betrayal and friendship, where one single wrong choice could end up dooming everything you care about and you like to feel the jarring tension and drama, then you'll love this work.\n\n\n-Art 7/10\n\nOK, this score is a bit viased; for a VN with so many endorphins-releasing situations, moments of sheer shock and fear.... I seriously expected more CGs of them, not just a black screen with the text. I know the most pivotal of them have CGs, but you can count those with one hand and there many, many more events that deserved a CG.\nAs for what Art Style and Quality over all, this VN has better art than many paid VNs; I'd give it a 10 in here.\n\n\n-Sound 10/10\n\nThe BGMs tend to be quite quiet and inconspicious when nothing of importance is happening, but when something big happens.... Well, the soundtrack kicks in just in the right way (to the point you might find yourself jumping in your seat if you favor headphones). All of the music is beautiful and perdfectly crafted for whatever events are taking place, and that's simply perfect. Love the opening soundtrack, too.\n\n\n-Characters 11/10\n\nThis review is viased too; I love monster girls in all their shapes (Monster Musume be praised! And Okayado-sensei's previous hentai works too, heheh) so, to have a REAL GOOD STORY, one that's not about silly romantic comedy or pointless fanservice, in a setting with monster girls on it is golden.\nGoing into the specifics, a good Female Protagonist (that isn't oversexualized), a Ditzy Dojikko Dragon with confidence issues, a Tsundere Ojou-sama Kitsune, a Lazy but Lovely Wolf Girl and a Cold and Harsh Elf spelled epicness to me. But, each of the characters is much, much deeper than just their physical traits; each of them feels and acts like a real living being; with virtues and faults, issues and traumas, and with unique and interesting personalities; characters you can relate to. (Such a thing is so rare these days).\n\n\n-Lenght 10/10\n\nAt first I thought this was too short (beat in on 3 hours, and got the True End in just two tries) and I was about to complain about it. Then, I saw that Kickstarter page with a fully-funded sequel, and all my complains vanished and were replaced by the desire of it being released soon. If it's as epic as this one, I'll get it even if I have to pay.\n\n\nSo, to sum up, if you're looking for a fanservice-packed romantic comedy, with lots of bouncing bewbs, panty shots and Gainaxing, then look elsewhere (try NekoPara, which is quite good in all the aforementioned, specially the last two). But, if you are looking for an epic drama filled with emotions and anxiety, then by all means, get this VN.","August 12, 2015","true","5.7"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

The concept is interesting, art style was nice/decent, BGs and BGM were good. But the beginning is boring; I love VNs with a complex story, but Rising Angels: Reborn was simply boring at some points. Character development wasn’t the best either (some characters were cute but others were mostly annoying, they acted so cliche and childish that it made hard to believe that this is a militar ship with adults around).\n\nBut I liked the fact that are multiple endings. This game is definitely better than a lot of paid VNs around Steam, but I hope that the sequel has some more action/plot twists.\n\n6/10, if you like sci-fi stories, this one might be a good call!","May 5","true","6.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I still recommend it if you're into visual novels and can overlook minor imperfections. The characters are interesting and engaging, if unrealistic in a charming way. Though I can't fault it, since it tries very hard to overcome this limitation, the game is limited as most choose-your-own-adventure style stories are in that it attempts to tell an engaging story while creating the impression that your choices matter. Unfortunately, it falls short when it comes to explaining the protagonist's intentions where choices are to be made, and the small speech bubbles that resemble choices are very vague. Like I said, I can't fault it. This is how visual novels do things. I just had a few "Comfort Misha" moments, which ultimately spoiled my enjoyment of the game. Hopefully others might find it more enjoyable, as this certainly stands above the mediocre masses of VNs out there.","September 13, 2014","true","4.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

The story was  interesting but in the end this game just isn't ..working out for me.  I guess my decisions didn't much influence the course of the game.\n\nWhat really bothered me were the relationships. I really tried various ways to romance with Sol but this game only had 1 love interest which was a girl/half dragon named Zuri .\nAside from that, Natalie was falling head over heals with Zuri as the story progresses even if I prefer talking to Sol. I feel like she fell in-love only because she was stressing out on how their missions didn't go too well and she was the only person she could rely on. It's just that I feel betrayed that this game was given to the general audience without a disclaimer that it's Yuri centric. I'm not a homophobe but I don't want to waste my time on relationship mechanics that doesn't align with my interest. It's misleading.\n\nThere was less screen time for their captain to appear and be involved, and she's even less significant than Natalie.

Being a gamer, and also being a reader(Assuming I actually like the content), I found this to be a very satisfying hybrid between the two worlds.

Is it a good visual novel? Yes.\nTo go into detail, I must say, the amount of detail in the dialogue is better than I expected from a free-to-play visual novel. The characters are believable. You feel that they are alive and that they mean something to you and not just some hollow arch-type character to move you along through the plot. The main story flows fluidly with the characters itself rather than the character-goes-here-for-the-plot type.\n\nThe music is decent. I mean, for a free-to-play, what do you expect? But, I do have some problems with some scenes in having the wrong kind of soundtrack to play in a heartwarming or first-clenching scenes. Other than that, it was okay.\n\nBut your main hook on this genre will not be the music, or the graphic (which is obviously CG drawn) or even the endings. Its the character development. You learn their history, their drive to their goal, their will. And you care for them across the story. With the amazing dialogue, I had no problem believing any of the hardships they went through together.\n\nIn the end, I was left feeling, "Wow, I wasn't expecting this good of an experience." And was satisfied with how the plot ends. I cared for the characters and even for the ones that died. It managed to enter my personal territory and made me feel sad with each hardship they go through. I want them to succeed and I cheered for them. All done without paying a single penny towards the developer. (Which made me feel sour at the end for enjoying such a good experience without paying a single penny)\n\nYou don't get a massive cliffhanger that makes you want to rip your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hair off, but it leaves enough plot to settle for a sequel (which they are working on and is being funded in a kickstarter)\n\nAll in all, this was a Visual Novel worth of your 2-3 hour of spare time and definitely worth doing all the routes to all the ending.

Reasons why to like it. Good Story, artwork, and there are choices. Difference on the 4.8 from a 5.0, is the regard of how long, sure scripts take a bit of reading but there seems like there could be more, options, routes, side stuff, but I digress. It made a lasting impression worth taking. Although free, I also seen the other work, very well done considering it's done by one person. Given that, I believe that they did a piece of well done work. I recommend it not only because it's free +(Bonus for a lot of us thanks to consideration) but also the fact that the story makes you think. Although there are some who think oh I don't want to play as a girl, it's how it was set. Enjoy it, let's not be dishonest, it's a good game. I recommend it because it filled the time and met my mark. Upon full review and I warn you\nSPOILERS AHEAD!!!\nI find that the pairings you have are limited and in CG\nFor instance I wouldn't have mind the elf-eared commander or the lupine girl as well on the route.\nAs for the other instances, there could have been other endings with other characters.\nI did like how the game shifts scenarios and the music plays a wonderful opening.\nHighly replayable but the options and set scenarios do worry. For instance there's not much variation between routes to lead to end. Not any passive alternate ends either.\n\nStill I do digress there is nice moments in the game where I find myself attached. For instance the fact of multiple races. Just wish there was also some other interaction but this novel meets as it's intended. Still kinda wished for more.\n\nMy range on this subject and opinion for game review and scale 4.2-4.8 out of 5.0 on an average just because it misses that if I'm talking about a full comparison to others that many have played.\n\nStill with the current resources that it was done by one person who did credit others. Duly noted on that, I do appreciate him taking the time to on his site write a review letter response which may have costed him fans but let's be honest. Not all of us take the time to make games with CG work and a Visual Story Line. Usually everyone is hyped over function and graphics. Well in this one, it's a VN for a reason hence why it meets the mark.","September 24, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One that jumble your emotions around made you wish you had friends like Natalie did, friends who you can call family.\n\nIt took my 5.4 hours to finish one of the multiple endings to Rising Angels: Reborn and it was amazing. This is the first visual novel game I have ever played and I absolutely loved it. The choices you make have more of an impact on the story than most RPG’s have today. Characters like Sol and Natalie reminded me of me, I felt empathy for Zuri and characters like Kika and Fayfe (I think I spelled those names wrong) really made me laugh and reminded me of the young narcissistic version of myself.

It would be a good choice for anyone looking to try one, since it's easy to understand, even for those unfamiliar with the genre.  It was enjoyable, and the different endings were all interesting.

A visual novel.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: This review may be lengthy is obviously lengthy. Also, I only clocked 1.1hrs and have not finished the whole "game" when writing this review. Will edit if needed once I actually complete the "game".\n\n___________________________________________\n\nYou're literally reading a book, and deciding on a few conversation choices that is seemingly pointless. From what I've experienced and been through in the hours I've clocked, I've made 4 conversation choices, 3 of which was pointless and could have either been taken out or just added to the storyline, but probably affects how your crew thinks of you. The only one that was actually a choice was the option to talk to the person of your choice.\n\nStoryline is great, but I do feel that it is a little draggy and slow. Nonetheless, when it starts to perk up to the mysteries, it kicks in well. Personally, I would have preferred to get to know each character slowly, but no. Everything was dumped on you right from the start. It's fine I guess, but that probably took up say about 30minutes of gameplay time(not accurate, just felt like it) to go around the spaceship to introduce yourself and do ice breakers with your crew.\n\nNot the best music, nor does it shout the worst music. It certainly does bring out the right atmosphere according to where you are in the story.\n\nThe art style in this VN strikes the word odd to me. In the spaceship, all the backgrounds pops out at you with a feeling of being detailed. Yet when you leave the ship to an outdoor scene, the backgrounds are less detailed, seemingly a quick painting sketch(it still looks detailed, but how should I put it... unlined or dabbling paint blobs?) Even within the spaceship, some backgrounds look a bit more on the realistic side, and some other scenes more cartoonish. At the end of the day, it's alright I guess.\n\nSo. Remember i started off with saying that this is a visual novel more than a game? Well at the end of the day, some people may find this VN engaging for the storyline, while some may deter from this for the lack of gameplay. Personally, Rising Angels isn't my cup of tea, no matter how much I like visual novel games. I believe that at it's price it is worth a try, but if you are looking for a more interactive type of Visual Novel game, you will try something else.","January 6, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not the most complex visual novel, it's almost completely linear if fact, but the choices you get to make do have an impact on the story and how far the game progresses before reaching one of the 5 or 6 endings. There's humor, intrigue, a little horror and some romance in there. The game isn't terribly long, depending on how fast you read I guess? 3-4 hours for an intense little romp through outer space with a colorful cast of characters felt just right and begging for a sequel that's already in development! If I had one complaint it would be a lack of artwork. I would have loved to have got to see pictures / artwork of the characters interacting more; the dinner scene, the arguments and other major events in the game needed there own artwork.

The story kept me interested and invested regardless of any romance paths. The story is about par for a mid level sci-fi story. Not the greatest work of literature ever created for its genere but enjoyable in every way if you are a fan of science fiction.\n\nThere are some cirtiques with regards to the story, for one, it focuses far too heavily on Zuri as oposed to spreading the story more evenly amongst the entire cast. Secondly, there are some writing mistakes. Where the text for a section is inconsitient with the events that have transpired. These are relitively minor oversights though.\n\nThe characters are charming and engaging in thier own way. I had my doubts with the cast of angels, demons, dragons, and furries, but each character managed to bring thier own personality to the front and such doubts faded away. The artwork is sparse, but well polished. Lastly playing from the persepctive of a female lead character was a rare treat, often neglected in the world of visual novels.\n\nThis would be a good game for $5-$10, that this game is free makes it outstanding value as the quality is definately well abolve average.","August 17, 2015","true","6.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's short, sweet and to the point, and given it's low, low price that's more than enough.\n\nWhile it may fall short of many other visual novels, Rising Angels: Reborn is one of the best original English language visual novels that i've played and i'm looking forward to what IDHAS studios comes up with in the future.","November 4, 2014","true","3.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It wasn't what I expected, nor did I read reviews beforehand, but it was a good game overall.  TL;DR - It's a good game, engaging, and chock-full of fun tidbits.\n\nPros:\n-Great cast and detail put into the story's universe (read the Data section; worth it)\n-Wonderful musical choice.  I only wish it was available in a separate file to listen to outside of the game.\n-Relatively short.  You won't kill a week playing this (maybe a weekend).\n-Autosave saves.  You can go back easily to change a particular outcome if you don't want to read through the whole game again.\nCons:\n-Limited replayability.  The plot is relatively set in stone, no matter the player's choice.  Some subtle changes.\n-Limited roleplaying.  More of an extended comic rather than "choose your adventure."  Not much choice divergence or opportunity.","September 26, 2014","true","14.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So feel free to (quick)save if you want to explore all paths (though you can just skip to the next decision whenever you want to).\nIs it worth your time? For me it was, but it certainly depends on what you like.\nThe focus on the game is less on action, but rather on characters and their relationships (e.g. girl-on-girl romance :D) as well as exploring the unknown and building all kinds of suspense in a sci-fi space ship environment.\nThe music was nice: versatile and fitting. The race concept\nDon't let the supposedly cute manga/anime look fool you, the initially light-hearted story becomes actually rather mature and thrilling, because unlike most movies or series (I guess you could compare it a bit with Star Trek or Andromeda), this has multiple endings, allowing twists which can be good, bad or something inbetween and there are several dilemas that have no "right" answer.","October 18, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Allow me to explain.\n\nGameplay.\nThe gameplay amounts to a few choices and nothing else. The gameplay is bearly there and what is there are, in my opinion, pointless. This might have been forgiven if the story and characters were amazing but that leads to problem number 2, the story and the characters.\n\nThe characters and story.\nThe characters are poorly developed and boring and its so easy to guess who the villain is. It also contains a bad romance system that is so half ♥♥♥♥♥ it makes sick just thinking about it and to top it off some characters are hardly seen, like the engineer, so that when there in danger you dont feel a thing towards them. The story is boring and its barely there because the game is filled with filler dialog and it trys ramp up the stakes by just telling you that the stakes are high.\n\nThe Artwork\nThe Artwork is good and well done and is the best part of the game. Thats it, nothing more.\n\nConclusion\nThis is not the worst game I have played but the problems just destroys it completely. My advise go play sunrider its free, fun and deeper then this game thats all.","November 17, 2014","false","8.2"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

I mean, as far as visual-novel-esque games go, this one was amazing. I hope this review will satify my entertaining excitement my heart is bursting with right now, for a free game too!\n\nFirst off, story. Amazing, for what it is and how it is delivered. Also, free game, so the content and quality expectations aren't very high. Spoiler-free, you get transfered from a listening post on a space-rock to your first ship where you have a certain mission that you have to accomplish. The story follows a strict space-ship crew exploring / adventuring. The game was actually pretty lengthy but the actual exploring / adventuring that happens is pretty... Eh. 5.5 hrs is a lot for a free game, though. This is the most I can say without spoiling a single thing.\n\nPersonally, I feel like the story takes pieces from stuff like Star Trek, Mass Effect, etc. The whole crew is of different races, the world that is described in this game piece-by-piece is suprisingly decent for how much you are given in the game itself, not including the codex in the data options menu. From my understanding, it's your classic world that is held together by alliances between major races and an intergalactic "senate", which I think is The Dictators in this game. I may be wrong.\n\nMusic was amazing. It had the sad heart-felt music. The action-y music. The up-beat "fun" music. It just fit wherever it was played. The tracks are short, so they repeat if you don't read fast enough but they were good enough for me to not care.\n\nFirst off, from what I understand, the romance in this game only has a yuri(girl-on-girl romance in japanese or something)/lesbian romance as I've figured out there's only one romance ending. This game has an obligatory romance theme. Not that it's a bad thing because they do it amazingly well and classy. There's no nudity, so you can only expect excellent art and cute pictures whenever you get them, which are few and far between but still worth it when you get them. Of all the characters(unless I'm missing some hidden options), including the one you CAN romance, have the usual archetypes of usual personalities but they were still done pretty well. You're going to have to insult me here because I can't really explain them but they were all great.\n\nThere's also a pretty cool "data" or extras section that has a bunch of codex/info you can read. It's amazing for world-building.\n\nThis is a short review but overall in said and unsaid words, I would definitely recommend this. It's free and it has an amazing story and atmosphere to it. Obviously don't try it if you're not into visual novels or overal story-orientated games. I'd easily give this game an 8/10. It's not perfect and I feel like a legitimate, money-costing game could be made from this. If a free game like this could give at least 5-10 hours and make me feel like every hour was worth it, then yeah. I'm game. It gave me a Mass Effect amosphere but that might just be me.\n\nEDIT: For the romance stuff, not sure. I may be wrong but there MIGHT be only one result and it I don't think it's obligatory. I'm playing through / skippinng through the stuff I haven't read yet to figure this one out but I think there's really only one option. One female, two if you count the not-so-much-a-romance-conlcusion","September 30, 2015","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Trucidar/recommended/321840/","Trucidar","Trucidar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Trucidar/","1625 products in account","What did I just witness? Firstly, this is basically a novel. There is very very little interaction. Secondly, it's incredibly poorly written. The characters are unbelievably inept and the entire adventure plays out like you would expect if you put a bunch of fifteen year old junior high school students in charge of a space ship. They all act like small children. At one point you're in a room of officers discussing who has crushes on who. It was very weird.\n\nIt's bad, it's cringeworthy, it has terrible pacing. Throughout the story most of the characters engage in extremely immature, childlike-banter. This includes when they are in serious and dangerous situations... "Oh we have a spy on board, I better take a moment out of this staff meeting to discuss how clumsy and silly our security officer is." What? The important point is that this is a school drama/relationship game. The ancient weapon plot is entirely in the background and barely relevant to what you spend most of your time doing: Gossiping with children.\n\nThe art is pretty lacking (and kind of weird - furry alert), and the music does not match the text at all. You can be in a really serious part, but the music is all happy, go-lucky. The music not only does not add anything to this game, it seriously detracts from it and is better off muted.\n\nI might have liked this game more when I was ten, but probably not since story is incredibly boring. Objectively and subjectively this is a terrible outing for the developer since they took an interesting idea and threw it out the door to instead focus on middle school drama. Hope they have better luck on the sequel.","September 14, 2014","false","1.7"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","10","25","0","0"

When I first looked at it, I was questioning whether or not to play it. I wasn't keen on the preview at first, and thought the art looked kinda "Meh". In the end, I decided I had nothing to lose by playing it, since it's free, and decided to give it a shot.\nI'm glad I did. The art kinda grew on me pretty quickly, and the characters were interesting, if some of them were a little cliche. The real highlight of this, however, is the story. It was tense, and had a lot of interesting points to it. Some of the options in-game didn't feel like they affected the outcome as much, but the number of options given overall still made it feel like I had control of the story. I only did one playthrough, so I can't speak for it's replayability, but it seems like the story would change a lot with a few other options taken, so I believe it should have decent replayability.\nI would definitely suggest giving it a try.","January 28, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here's some basic points to touch on (I'm going to skip rating the story itself to prevent spoilers in such a small game; suffice to say that I liked it)\n\nGameplay:\nNonexistent. This is the epitome of a visual novel, click to advance text and watch the story unfold and occasionally you will be given a choice of actions to take. Some choices only let you hear varying lines of new dialogue, and others will affect which of the endings you will end up seeing. If you aren't a fan of visual novels, this one isn't inventive enough to change your mind and it will likely be the first thing someone can use as an excuse to avoid this game.\n\nCharacters:\nI find the characters varied and they can be fun to interact with. Al and Sol are rather bland, but the hyperactive security officer Zuri and timid engineer Kylie can have some good moments. My only real complaints are that 1) the game isn't really long enough to flesh out any characters other than Kika and/or Zuri and 2) there aren't really enough opportunities presented that let the characters act as meaningful foils to play off of each other.\nMy own personal bias towards the game will certainly be placed in this category. I personally resonated with Natalie's story and personality; not just her "Why does everyone else get the fun jobs when I'm so much better suited than them?" attitude. No, I mean the entire thing, mistakes an harsh self-realizations included.\n\nLinguistics:\nOkay, time to be brutally honest. While this feels like a natively English script rather than a translation like most visual novels are, there are a few typos (particularly later in the story) that can really be a distraction. I've dealt with far worse scripts in my time playing these kinds of games, but there were a few sentences that had me scratching my head trying to figure out what they meant before I realized it was simply a script error. At time's like these, it feels less like the native script I mentioned and more like a good fan-sub that unfortunately didn't have enough time to proofread their later files before hitting deadline of some sort. This doesn't make the game unplayable by any means, but given that I've seen people condemn perfectly good games for far less, I felt I needed to come clean and mention it.\n\nArt:\nThe visual presentation of the characters feels distinctly different from the raw anime/manga-inspired designs I've gotten used to, but I can't say that this style is bad. The characters all look pretty nice, and the backgrounds are pleasing to the eye...I still can't understand why anyone would curl their hair into drill shapes though. That will forever be an artistic mystery lost upon my uncultured upbringing I guess.\n\nMusic:\nAppropriate for the settings. No individually memorable pieces, but I always felt it was enhancing the mood, not hindering it.\n\nPrice:\nThe game's free. Look, if you are on the edge about this game to read reviews about it, then get it. It will cost you no money, and it's not some huge, meandering AAA game that takes an ungodly amount of time to finally get into the main plot. I went on a 100% run without a walkthrough or any outside resources and completed everything in (*looks at logged playtime*) six hours. It's not a huge RPG or anything, so by the time you've gone through the first half hour or so, you will likely have met the characters you will be spending the game with and heard the basic premise of the plot, and for a visual novel, characters and story are pretty much everything. So if the game hasn't grabbed you well enough by that time, then drop it, but the least you could do is give it a shot.","December 10, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here's some basic points to touch on (I'm going to skip rating the story itself to prevent spoilers in such a small game; suffice to say that I liked it)\n\nGameplay:\nNonexistent. This is the epitome of a visual novel, click to advance text and watch the story unfold and occasionally you will be given a choice of actions to take. Some choices only let you hear varying lines of new dialogue, and others will affect which of the endings you will end up seeing. If you aren't a fan of visual novels, this one isn't inventive enough to change your mind and it will likely be the first thing someone can use as an excuse to avoid this game.\n\nCharacters:\nI find the characters varied and they can be fun to interact with. Al and Sol are rather bland, but the hyperactive security officer Zuri and timid engineer Kylie can have some good moments. My only real complaints are that 1) the game isn't really long enough to flesh out any characters other than Kika and/or Zuri and 2) there aren't really enough opportunities presented that let the characters act as meaningful foils to play off of each other.\nMy own personal bias towards the game will certainly be placed in this category. I personally resonated with Natalie's story and personality; not just her "Why does everyone else get the fun jobs when I'm so much better suited than them?" attitude. No, I mean the entire thing, mistakes an harsh self-realizations included.\n\nLinguistics:\nOkay, time to be brutally honest. While this feels like a natively English script rather than a translation like most visual novels are, there are a few typos (particularly later in the story) that can really be a distraction. I've dealt with far worse scripts in my time playing these kinds of games, but there were a few sentences that had me scratching my head trying to figure out what they meant before I realized it was simply a script error. At time's like these, it feels less like the native script I mentioned and more like a good fan-sub that unfortunately didn't have enough time to proofread their later files before hitting deadline of some sort. This doesn't make the game unplayable by any means, but given that I've seen people condemn perfectly good games for far less, I felt I needed to come clean and mention it.\n\nArt:\nThe visual presentation of the characters feels distinctly different from the raw anime/manga-inspired designs I've gotten used to, but I can't say that this style is bad. The characters all look pretty nice, and the backgrounds are pleasing to the eye...I still can't understand why anyone would curl their hair into drill shapes though. That will forever be an artistic mystery lost upon my uncultured upbringing I guess.\n\nMusic:\nAppropriate for the settings. No individually memorable pieces, but I always felt it was enhancing the mood, not hindering it.\n\nPrice:\nThe game's free. Look, if you are on the edge about this game to read reviews about it, then get it. It will cost you no money, and it's not some huge, meandering AAA game that takes an ungodly amount of time to finally get into the main plot. I went on a 100% run without a walkthrough or any outside resources and completed everything in (*looks at logged playtime*) six hours. It's not a huge RPG or anything, so by the time you've gone through the first half hour or so, you will likely have met the characters you will be spending the game with and heard the basic premise of the plot, and for a visual novel, characters and story are pretty much everything. So if the game hasn't grabbed you well enough by that time, then drop it, but the least you could do is give it a shot.","December 10, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm actually glad I did. I scored the good ending! But, time to back track and see what else is in store for the many other endings. I was expecting to see a lot more info about the characters and their past. I'd like to more about characters before I actually begin to adore them. Just knowing the kind of things they've been through is what a makes a character alive. But, since we are playing as Natalie Puccile, the main character, there really isn't any of that unless the others wish to share it themselves. I'm going to try playing it again to see what other endings there are if I didn't choose what I did. I like the characters and the idea of it being in space and the unique races there are. At first, I was completely skeptical about the game when I looked at the reviews, so I gave it a follow and downloaded it to give it a chance. And I did.\nSurprisingly, some of the characters weren't as annoying as I expected. There were times where I got annoyed but they didn't show up as often so there was no need to feel angry or irrate by them. I really feel there should be more times where we can decide instead of having certain situations where we SHOULD respond instead of it giving us the 'go' signal at unsuspecting times. There were times where I really wished I could choose a way.\nThe art was easy on the eyes and the characters were nicely drawn. Although, there were times where you saw another bit of artwork but it looked a bit different from the current ones you see at every dialogue. Hopefully, it will look a bit better once part two of the game is out. I also appreciated that there wasn't any fanservice as any anime-related game would have. The girls wore modest uniforms and they all had normal, human proportions despite some of them being of a different species. Nor was there any kind of perverse ideas from the colonel, he was just odd and suspicious (which concludes why our main heroine lacks trust in him). I hope once part two is out, there will be more things for us and maybe some new and old characters that we will to love. I look forward to playing Fate.","December 14, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Partially, this is explained or at least commented on in-universe. Sol, this ships XO and the protagonist's friend, is constantly frustrated by his backwater no-name ship's crew and their lack of discipline. The ship itself? Small, and as you will learn, poorly equipped and outfitted. Some of the lack of professionalism in the crew can be explained by the fact that, honestly, you're serving on a ship in the dregs.\n\n\nThe Art is mostly good. Character sprites, at least, are good. It's a VN, so don't expect them to be too dynamic, but damn the Zuri sprites are expressive and honestly it just made me like her a ton.\n\n\nMusic is okay? Honestly the music is the weakest part. It's a VN, so that's not the worst sin, but a great VN has great music. It's not Juniper's Knot. The menu music is like super emo-kid Mayday Parade sounding, which personally I like but I know will make others roll their eyes.\n\n\nThe Story? Good. This is pretty decent sci-fi, but do NOT expect hard scifi. And that's fine. Social SF is a thing, it's totally a thing, and this is what it looks like. You are tasked with uncovering a mystery both outside your ship, in the dark of space, and... well, you'll see. The investigation requires you to make a few choices, some of which seem kind of innocent at first. The innocent choices having later ramifcations is actually really interesting and refreshing. The foreshadowing is there, which is nice, but its a bit heavy handed. Overall? It's a decent story that has a lot of potential to be expanded upon in the SEQUEL that will be coming eventually.\n\n\ntl;dr: play it! It's free, it's fun, it's surprisingly good for a free game and a free Visual novel at that. You can make kissu faces at a cute dragon girl, save the universe, shoot people, and be on a crew with a space elf commander! Super fun.

Being a fan of sci-fi themes helps.\n\nOne thing I really liked was the female protagonist, and that's something that doesn't happen very often, as good heroines are hard to come by. I felt that her personality was very organic, and that her character development flowed well and wasn't forced or abrupt. Also, for someone who isn't really an anime fan, I felt like the character interactions between themselves were believeable and not overly exaggerated, which is a problem I sometimes have with anime. Overall I really enjoyed the game and felt like it was a great use of my time.\n\nNow, the only thing that bugged me a little (and I know some people will disagree with me) is how IMO, especially near the end;\n\n(Semi-spoiler alert?)\n\nit tried to appeal specifically to players who find women appealing. It felt like you were pushed into it, which was a bit of an immersion breaker for me. --That and coupled with the disappointment of finally finding a strong heroine I could relate to, only to find out that, surprise (not really, of course)!

Everything is smooth, and despite a few sentences that could have been worded better, the game is just amazing. Every moment has you on the edge of your seat, waiting to find out whether it ends well or not. There's humor, quirky characters, and drastic plot twists at every turn. One moment, you think you might have done something to save everyone and get a happy ending, but as the story progresses, the main character, the other characters, and yourself are always questioning whether what is being done is right.\n\nI also enjoyed how everything was questioned as it was. The characters never once just made assumptions, unless they were ones that they had no choice but to make. You never felt at ease and never felt "safe" unless the creators of this masterpiece wanted you to.\n\nThough, I was surprised by the lack of choices presented. For the most part, you feel like you're reading a story rather than playing a game. However, when you did make big decisions, they reminded me of Mass Effect and how EVERY decision you made affected the outcome, and not in little ways either.\n\nWith all of that said, I would definitely recommend playing this game. And why wouldn't you? It's free and compatible with just about everything computer related. There would be nothing to lose, but quite an enjoyable ride to gain.\n\n(On a side note, I'm also looking forward to more games by these people thanks to being introduced to this one.)","October 1, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lanfranc1/recommended/321840/","lanfranc1","Lanfranc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lanfranc1/","285 products in account","The basics first – Rising Angels: Reborn is an anime-style visual novel. It doesn't have any gameplay as such; it tells a story through dialogues and lets you make decisions about its direction at various points, which will give you different endings. The graphics are more or less entirely still images. Backgrounds are well done, even if there aren't very many of them, so they can get a little repetitive. The character images are good as well, even though the character *designs* are very stereotypical - basically just humanoid feline alien, humanoid canine alien, angel alien, demon alien, etc. Not very creative.\n\nSo, "Do you recommend this game?", Steam asks. I really wanted to like this game, and I kind of do, but at the same time...\n\nA VN stands or falls by its story and characters – that's basically all there is, so it has to be good. And my issue with RA:R is that the main characters are just incredibly unprofessional and emotionally unstable. The protagonist, who is some sort of military special investigator, repeatedly overlooks or fails to follow up on obvious clues and inconsistencies. The ship's executive officer keeps droning on about teamwork and regulations, yet he's also a blatant racist who continually denigrates the other members of the (predominantly non-human) crew. The navigator is a sheer megalomaniac. The ship's doctor is incompetent. No one seems able to follow a straight order and several characters are just downright corrupt or insubordinate. And even in obvious crisis situations, almost all of them keep getting sidetracked by emotional angst or just plain chatter.\n\nThe story is actually quite touching and deals with some interesting ethical and emotional issues, but it would be a lot better if it was more mature and didn't rely so much on "holding the idiot ball" (as TvTropes calls it). Even allowing for some anime "over the top"-ness, I just can't believe these people are the highly-trained officers they're supposed to be. It feels more like a secondary school class than a military crew.\n\nBut even after all that, and after literally shouting at the screen more than once when the characters did something stupid… it still did manage to hold my interest for over two hours, and by the end I was genuinely engaged in the protagonist and the choices and sacrifices she had to make.\n\n"Do you recommend this game?" Yeah, I mean, I suppose so? I think it's a bit of a flawed gem. (Not a diamond or a ruby. Maybe a garnet or jade.) It's free and can be completed in a couple of hours, so you might as well take a look at it and see if you like it. I'll probably play it again to see a few of the other endings.","September 21, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Partially, this is explained or at least commented on in-universe. Sol, this ships XO and the protagonist's friend, is constantly frustrated by his backwater no-name ship's crew and their lack of discipline. The ship itself? Small, and as you will learn, poorly equipped and outfitted. Some of the lack of professionalism in the crew can be explained by the fact that, honestly, you're serving on a ship in the dregs.\n\n\nThe Art is mostly good. Character sprites, at least, are good. It's a VN, so don't expect them to be too dynamic, but damn the Zuri sprites are expressive and honestly it just made me like her a ton.\n\n\nMusic is okay? Honestly the music is the weakest part. It's a VN, so that's not the worst sin, but a great VN has great music. It's not Juniper's Knot. The menu music is like super emo-kid Mayday Parade sounding, which personally I like but I know will make others roll their eyes.\n\n\nThe Story? Good. This is pretty decent sci-fi, but do NOT expect hard scifi. And that's fine. Social SF is a thing, it's totally a thing, and this is what it looks like. You are tasked with uncovering a mystery both outside your ship, in the dark of space, and... well, you'll see. The investigation requires you to make a few choices, some of which seem kind of innocent at first. The innocent choices having later ramifcations is actually really interesting and refreshing. The foreshadowing is there, which is nice, but its a bit heavy handed. Overall? It's a decent story that has a lot of potential to be expanded upon in the SEQUEL that will be coming eventually.\n\n\ntl;dr: play it! It's free, it's fun, it's surprisingly good for a free game and a free Visual novel at that. You can make kissu faces at a cute dragon girl, save the universe, shoot people, and be on a crew with a space elf commander! Super fun. Godspeed.","February 17, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, this was the first 'visual novel' I've played through.\n\nIn the past, I had kept away from visual novels, expecting them to be a creepy waste of time and money.   However, this one was free and I figured I had less to lose by giving it a shot.  I'll be vague to avoid spoiling story!\n\nI was hoping for an interesting story.  In my opinion, it delivered!  I also had extremely low expectations for gameplay, but it exceeded those expectations with some rare opportunities to choose the protagonist's response which could alter the story in some interesting ways.  After trying most of those options and triggering many things, I was further amused.\n\nIn hindsight, I think I had previously become jaded about games/stories offering story choices, particularly games that had hyped the importantce of choices but failed to deliver both choice and importance (I'M LOOKIN' AT YOU, FABLE.)  For me, this story has rekindled an interest, and I'll find out whether or not I regret that interest later.\n\nTo me, the three main drawbacks of this title are that parts of the story can feel a little forced, sometimes the behavior of the military characters can feel immersion-breaking, and in some cases there were typos and incorrect words used.  Taking the whole work into consideration, those faults seemed quite trivial and forgivable (and frankly my english isn't perfect either.)\n\nFinal notes:\n-Once inside the game, the "Data" button can offer some backstory/worldbuilding.\n-During my replays, I never noticed the "skip" settings doing anything when I changed them, but I may just be confused about them.\n\nI would recommend Rising Angels: Reborn, though probably not to kids considering the story can get pretty dark.","August 15, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mind, it isn’t enough to warrant being called a masterpiece, but I would most definitely recommend this to people looking for a good VN.\n\nThere are five endings, with only the dying ones being particularly bad (and even then, it’s on the grey; it’s a morality issue/reflection). It’s not so hard to get ‘100%’ or what counts for it (completing the gallery since there are no achievements, and probably seeing all the endings) since the choices are obvious but at the same time impactful; they’re not the dreary and mindless ‘pick A for this ending and pick B for this ending’ kind we’re sometimes saddled with and you do have to put some effort into thinking what choice would get you where you want. Mostly, though, there are many choices where it’s hard to say which was the ‘right’ choice - the whole thing deals with differing views of morality and who to trust.\n\nIn summary, the art is simple (not overtly beautiful, but not ugly; somewhere above passable), the music is agreeable (didn’t really stand out, but I think it did the work justice), the writing is well done (if a tad uncreative at some parts, but it is pretty well-written and gives you much to think about), and the decision points are the exact thing you want out of a Visual Novel (especially with how the decisions reflect on you as a person and your personal take on what should be done, encompassing morality, authority, loyalty, et al.).\n\nI can say I enjoyed going through this. I’d give it a solid 7/10 overall, but about an 8/10 where it matters (for the genre).","August 16, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This song made me feel like it would be awesomer than it was. It was alright, but not very open in terms of story-telling. You ultimately decide nothing except whether or not at the very end it will be a regular open-ended ending or a neutral or bad ending. Congratulations Rising Angels: Reborn. You wasted a good two hours of our lives.\n\nNow, I wouldn't be so critical if they had at least given us more room to establish a different romantic route for this game but nope. They went ahead and decided that for you too. It's always either vaguely (SPOILERS REDACTED) or already determined. I was honestly hoping for an Azaiah route. I personally go for the cool-headed, commanding glasses types. They are strict and stubborn, but their heart is always ultimately in the right place.\n\nBut nope. They (SPOILERS REDACTED). So that's out.\n\nEverything is essentially decided for us except whether or not we're going to need to continue to the next game to have a REAL ending rather than what they called the ending of Rising Angels Reborn.\n\nAnd honestly, who didn't see the big reveal coming? It wasn't very suspenseful. I mean...you pretty much know the gist of what happens by the time you finish the trailer so apparently they probably have never heard the phrase "it's better to conceal than reveal".\n\nI only hope that they give us more of a challenge with Rising Angel: Fates, but, as with the chances of Fate/Extra CCC ever being translated, my hopes are low.","September 22, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your character spends her time making tough choices while learning about herself in the process. She has a whole crew of people to get to know, each with their own interesting stories and unique personalities. Yet when things start going amiss she finds herself in a struggle of trusting the people that she wants to believe in. If you love stories like this, playing the game more than once reveals so much more about your new friends each step you take. Over all the art is much better than most games in this genre, and you have a great story to be explored as well.

I expected more decisions and to have a bigger impact on the story, but I suppose this is a visual novel, not a 'choose your own way' game. The main character's arc seems kind of forced, like she changes but there's not much to motivate that change in the first place. The characters have interesting backstories and entertaining interactions, and there's not a single 'perfect' character, which is refreshing.\nEven as I complained about Sol's racism, I still appreciated his character. Kika was initially my least favorite, but that quickly changed as I learned more about her. I really enjoyed the romance between Natalie and Zuri; it was adorable and, honestly, what kept me playing the game. Stan was obvious from the very beginning, so painfully obvious that I wished for the traitor to be ANYONE else. His character was probably the flattest and least interesting, just a typical villain. It made me angry how oblivious everyone was for so long. Though that build up of anger toward him did help make the decision to kill him or not much harder.\nThis game had an intriguing story, and it's better than a lot of VNs out there, so it's worth playing. I'll definitely play the sequel if it's free as well.\nOh, and if there's a Faye fanclub out there somewhere, I want in.

Ultimately, I recommend it because I paid nothing for it, and I was compelled enough by the story to finish it.  However, one should probably know that it plays more like a kinetic visual novel than a branching one that can be influenced.  Most choices either don't matter or you die when you choose the wrong one--so there is no real replay value.\n\nPros:\n- Good artwork\n- Great story! I could not predict everything.\n- A good array of intriguing characters (if not fleshed out as much as I'd hoped. I really wanted to know others' personalities and motives better.)\n- Happily, the script and the language is all nicely done. Few grammar/spelling/punctuation issues. (I only mention this because it's a prominent thing in a lot of VNs.)\n\nCons:\n- A kinetic dependence on one character (Zuri) whose personality was very much a one-trick pony.  If you, like me, didn't like her from the get-go, just stop.  She's a forcibly large presence in the story. (On the upside, though, she's the only one who seemed to me to be continuously repetitive.)\n- No control over much of anything. There are a few path changes that have could heavily influenced the story outcome but really don't.\n\nIt's definitely worth a play if you're looking for a good overall story! Not as much if you're looking for a VN about detailed characterization.  Thanks for offering it up on Steam :)","June 6, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll try to keep spoilers at the very bottom below a warning.\n\nCharacters: I have to agree with another review long before this. Three characters, at LEAST, wouldn't last long in an actual military situation. It's kind of possible to wave it off as Sol covering for them because they're trustable when it counts, but it still takes a lot of suspension of disbelief. As far as VN games go, it's not outside the acceptable for two of them. But Spoiler doesn't even fit into that. The main character is pretty good, though some of the choices she makes are insane, and that she doesn't figure out a few of the issues is pathetic with how obvious they are. The other characters are good, at least as far as characters go, but they have the same issues of ignoring obvious answers. Speaking of obvious answers with the characters, it would take the antithesis of Sherlock Holmes to fail to figure out who it is early on. Hint: Spoiler. All in all, enjoyable.\n\nArt: Hit and miss, really. Most of it is pretty good, some is great, and some is passable. All in the same picture, in one case. Again, it's good overall.\n\nStory: Basically, you're isolated to a single ship of a few people on a single mission that spirals out of control due in part to your failure. You go to the surface twice, with one instance possibly resulting in death. Having only played through once, I don't know if the choice in question gets you killed or not. The thing that you're looking for doesn't quite make sense, because it's from a dead civilization, yet Spoiler, despite it Spoiler.\n\nSound: I can't really comment. I played with sound off.\n\nOverall, it's a good game with good art, good characters, and a good story. For a free game, I definitely recommend it. It's worth more playthroughs, and I'll definitely being going through it some more.\n\n\n\n\n\n------Spoilers------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe doctor is totally unbelievable. He doesn't know anything with medicine, apparently, he actively tries to prevent the medical treatment of an injured character and nobody bats an eye, and he's so clearly the bad guy that there's no tension. Even his "grand plan" is obvious. Poison the poisened character with a fake antidote and do it all for money.\nNot to mention that he SOMEHOW has something that can make someone's organs break down just sitting on the ship. Yeah, the smuggling issue sort of covers that, but surely something that bad would be regulated and require the captain to know about it. SOMETHING.\n\nHint: IT'S THE DEMON WHO IS TOTALLY INCOMPETENT YET SOMEHOW IS OF HIGHER RANK THAN THE MAIN CHARACTER. THE ONE WHO IS CLEARLY LOOKS EVIL ON THE START SCREEN.\n\nIt affects what's used for modern space travel despite the thing it affecting never being said to have other uses (other than ship radios) and only being found in three places throughout the whole galaxy.\n\n(Edit) Another spoiler that strains suspension of disbelief. After Stan killed someone, held a gun to Nat's head, tried to kill everyone on the ship, and poisoned Faye, shooting him causes Nat to lose herself. No option to keep the crystal to avoid the government getting it, no option to destroy it even though it wasn't being used in the engine, nothing. Just Nat and Zuri being depressed for the rest of their lives. That's just... too hard to believe. Further, choosing to hand over the crystal to the government says that the crystal was used for the engine even if it wasn't. Not huge, but one of a few small issues.","November 2, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do not reccommend this game if you don't like reading rather corny dialogues, as it has a LOT of that. also, just to give you a fair heads-up, this book (not game, as it isn't a game, it's just a digital book with a trivial choice here and there) is fairly short and very well-worth the time spent to play it. which is about...oh....maybe two or three hours? it took me about seven, but I click slowly, so....yeah. the soundtrack was mostly boring, but one song was WAY too 'action-packed' for a book like this. the presentation wasn't entirely what I had hoped for, and the characters lacked the level of depth that I am used to.\nNot to say this book was BAD or anything; I rather enjoyed it. It's just that it seems rather...lacking. still, not bad for free. when I finished reading, it said I had "ending three". implying that there are at least three endings. I rather like multiple ending-stuff, actually....however, I am still yet unsure whether or not I'll hit that 'uninstall button' yet. Playing as a special operative named 'Natalie', I find it odd how you almost never get to see the main protagonist, beyond a facial portrait. Still, I decided to stick with it until the end, because I don't leave things unfinished.\nAs for this book, I am thoroughly unimpressed, even for a "FTR" book. (Free-To-Read.) it wasn't as bad as MOST novels nowadays, but the storytelling was dry, the tense action-parts had no excitement, the mystery-parts had almost no challenge, et cetera. I do not wish to give any spoilers, in case you want to try, then please, be my guest! go ahead. it costs nothing, and was a minor amusement while it lasted. but I'll have slightly lower expectations from part 2.\nI was expecting an RPG, because everyone was calling it an RPG when they reccommended it to me. what I found instead was a use for a windowed operation to be running while I do resolution tests for my monitor, and RP-chat with friends online in the background. Sadly, I cannot think of any "good points" for this book beyond that the main protagonist, the aforementioned 'Natalie', is slightly visually attractive. but if I wanted 'attractive visuals' and 'eye-pleasing female protagonists', I'd go watch the Vocaloids do their thing.\nIt DID have some nice artwork in it, however....again, not saying much.","November 12, 2015","false","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked how it played out, definitely. It was a nice change of pace, I haven't had a nice dose of betrayal, hatred, and sudden crisis in a while. I found myself playing 5 hours trying to make sure I thought over my decisions. Graphically, the thing is dashing. I enjoyed the soundtrack overall and was wondering if I could obtain it somehow. While some things were iffy here and there, but I found myself on a great loving with how this was presented. I felt myself relating with Zuri on how they felt ditzy and unable to do the simplest things, and feeling inferior and unneeded at times.

I do not reccommend this game if you don't like reading rather corny dialogues, as it has a LOT of that. also, just to give you a fair heads-up, this book (not game, as it isn't a game, it's just a digital book with a trivial choice here and there) is fairly short and very well-worth the time spent to play it. which is about...oh....maybe two or three hours? it took me about seven, but I click slowly, so....yeah. the soundtrack was mostly boring, but one song was WAY too 'action-packed' for a book like this. the presentation wasn't entirely what I had hoped for, and the characters lacked the level of depth that I am used to.\nNot to say this book was BAD or anything; I rather enjoyed it. It's just that it seems rather...lacking. still, not bad for free. when I finished reading, it said I had "ending three". implying that there are at least three endings. I rather like multiple ending-stuff, actually....however, I am still yet unsure whether or not I'll hit that 'uninstall button' yet. Playing as a special operative named 'Natalie', I find it odd how you almost never get to see the main protagonist, beyond a facial portrait. Still, I decided to stick with it until the end, because I don't leave things unfinished.\nAs for this book, I am thoroughly unimpressed, even for a "FTR" book. (Free-To-Read.) it wasn't as bad as MOST novels nowadays, but the storytelling was dry, the tense action-parts had no excitement, the mystery-parts had almost no challenge, et cetera. I do not wish to give any spoilers, in case you want to try, then please, be my guest! go ahead. it costs nothing, and was a minor amusement while it lasted. but I'll have slightly lower expectations from part 2.\nI was expecting an RPG, because everyone was calling it an RPG when they reccommended it to me. what I found instead was a use for a windowed operation to be running while I do resolution tests for my monitor, and RP-chat with friends online in the background. Sadly, I cannot think of any "good points" for this book beyond that the main protagonist, the aforementioned 'Natalie', is slightly visually attractive. but if I wanted 'attractive visuals' and 'eye-pleasing female protagonists', I'd go watch the Vocaloids do their thing.\nIt DID have some nice artwork in it, however....again, not saying much.","November 12, 2015","false","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I first looked at it, I was questioning whether or not to play it. I wasn't keen on the preview at first, and thought the art looked kinda "Meh". In the end, I decided I had nothing to lose by playing it, since it's free, and decided to give it a shot.\nI'm glad I did. The art kinda grew on me pretty quickly, and the characters were interesting, if some of them were a little cliche. The real highlight of this, however, is the story. It was tense, and had a lot of interesting points to it. Some of the options in-game didn't feel like they affected the outcome as much, but the number of options given overall still made it feel like I had control of the story. I only did one playthrough, so I can't speak for it's replayability, but it seems like the story would change a lot with a few other options taken, so I believe it should have decent replayability.\nI would definitely suggest giving it a try.","January 28, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I must be doing something wrong because no matter what choices I've made the romance happened anyway.\n\nThe story isn't bad, but too many of the player judgement/decision points only give the player two choices limiting the game's replay value in my opinion.\n\nAs free to play I think the game is ok, and worth the price.

However, i can say that this i would highly recommend this visual novel to people like me who have never played a visual novel before but want to start doing so.\n\nThe beginning feels very slow at first. But once the plot starts to unfold, things get very interesting. I really enjoyed the story. I enjoyed it even more so because i love space and the cosmos and all of that stuff which made it easier for me to get into this visual novel. The overall writing from the perspective of someone that's new to visual novels was very good. Infact, my only real complaint with this visual novel is that there were a few typos. These typos were few and far between and barely disrupted the flow of the story, but only for a brief moment before i was instantly recaptured by the story and characters.\n\nThe characters in my opinion are good, and the writers did a good job of giving each and every character a personality of their own and giving them emotions that the player can clearly pick up on. It was easy to become attached to some characters (I freaking <3 Zuri. Definitely my fav) and despise others.\n\nFor those that actually have experience with visual novels, this one might not be for you. There are not a lot of choices in this VN and the choices are pretty spaced out. So unless you are looking for a visual novel that you can pretty much play just for the sake of reading and letting the story unfold without a lot of HUGE  decisions that drastically change the ending that you get, this isn't the one for you. There are a few crucial decisions but not a lot.\n\nAs a great VN for new comers, i would give this a 9.5/10. the only thing keeping me from giving it a 10/10 are the few typos. Rising Angels: Reborn is a solid visual novel and i definitely hope that developers release some sequals to this VN :D\n\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, i'm gunna try not to be over come by my crush on Zuri XD ;-;","June 12, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not really into Yuri so that aspect of it didn't really amaze me but it was still interesting enough.  The 'bad guy' and overall mystery was easy to call imo but I feel that way about most mystery's so I can't really knock it too much for that either.\n\nI do wish there were more romance options, or alternate stories depending on choices.  The lack of many defining choices would probably be my largest complaint in this game.  I like having a lot of different options when I play this style of game.  Overall it felt more like a sci-fi novel with pretty pics than an interactive game.\n\nThe complaints above aside, I'd say it's worth the read - particularly as it's free.

It creates tension when each crew member is different and they don't necessarily like one another.  It was hard to take seriously when conflicts played out and reminded me of childish fights with a sibling.\n\nThe ideas of the different alien cultures are good, the gradual reveal of the Dreamon culture was good.  The characters themselves don't have a lot of subtlety, though, and show their hands before the time is right in the plot.\n\nIt's odd that most of the crew are as unorganized as they are, even for rookies.  Perhaps it's that in similarly-themed series (Star Trek: TNG or Mass Effect), even the most inexperienced crew members are more organized, at least once the mission or survival is of primary importance.\n\nIt was fun to see other choices and variations on further playthroughs, as the situations you end up in are fun to see, unfortunately some choices won't change a lot of the story.\n\nThere aren't many choices for a love interest. It feels like you could have had more. The Main Character is only interested in women. Shame for anyone who may find the men interesting.\n\nThis game puts an interesting spin on doomsday cliches, but I can't help but compare because I have a lot of Visual Novel and Sci-Fi media experience.  I wish the developers the best.  If you're looking for sci-fi stories that can be challenging, this VN is maddeningly close, but not quite there.\n\nTL;DR: This game is good in concept and execution, despite weak characterization.  Play it at least once if you love VNs, because it has something fun and unique to offer despite its flaws.","May 16","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
