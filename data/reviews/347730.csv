"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/recommended/347730/","LadyTenjoin","LadyTenjoin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/","983 products in account","Gist of the story\nDue to the events that happened in the past, an apartment is locked in an eternal limbo, haunting present and future occupants into obsession, an obsession that will lead them to a damning death if they ever found the truth.\n\nCurrently, a young man by the name of Benjamin Moss resides in this cursed abode. No matter where he moves, the walls and rooms of this cursed place grip his very being, making him restless and hollow. Stained on his walls are the numbers, “5676.” Are these numbers linked to the mysterious, paranormal activities occurring in his home? Desperate for answers, he begins his search for the truth but will he drive himself into madness in the process?\n\n---\n\nGameplay\nIt consists of solving puzzles in a form of riddles and the occasional searching for items to proceed forward through the story, e.g., hammers for destroying brittle walls.\n\nThe appearances of the threats are mostly scripted, and they don’t chase you around so you are free to take your time and absorb the environment. There isn’t much to explore anyways but certain events change to an extent depending on the number of your playthrough. For example, there’s a part in the beginning of the first run where you have to mess around with a circuit breaker (the power cuts off). The same thing happens in the second playthrough, however, instead of going to the breaker, you must exit the apartment to complete this sequence. They are small changes but they keep the game fresh and increase the replay value.\n\nThere are also a couple of alternate endings, but I only found two of them for now. I will update when I find more or when the developer confirms the number of endings.\n\n---\n\nDid ya scare me?\nThe scare factor of the game, on the scale of 1-10 (1 being, “me looking for something to scare me but couldn’t find it, no matter how hard I tried” and 10 being, “I ♥♥♥♥ my pants, I should’ve worn a diaper”), I rate Wait- Extended a 4, “the game tries.”\n\nI would say that certain parts are creepy but Wait certainly is more story-driven rather than scaring its players. Since the threat isn’t present all the time, the game relies on sounds and narrative to set the atmosphere. I did notice that some of the background sounds are reused sound assets. I recognize them from other games.\n\n---\n\nGraphics and Technical Difficulties\nIt is a RpgMaker game so I think most people know what these games look like. I didn’t run across any gamebreaking bugs or crashes but I did have a problem putting the game on fullscreen. After several button pressing later, I found that F5 seems to toggle the fullscreen and windowed mode. I don’t play many RpgMaker games so this might be standard procedure for them.\n\n---\n\nMy observations\nThe game has a slow start and the plot isn’t fully explained by just playing the game one time. It is only towards the end that the story opens up. I do like how certain actions dictate what the ending will. The Steam page says there are hidden storylines. I have no idea what they are but when I find some time, I will be playing around with the game to scour for them.\n\nMy first playthrough took me an hour and subsequent runs might take another hour, depending on how long you solve puzzles. I think the game is interesting enough to keep you playing because the plot twists are handled well. Just don’t expect a scarefest.\n\n---\n\nWrap Up\nFor its price range, $7.99 (has a small discount, $6.79, at the time of this review), I recommend this game. It isn’t expensive and there’s a nice story within its walls. Thanks for reading!\n\n---\n\nTL: DR\nPros:\n\n- Story-driven\n- Has different alternate endings\n- Has replay value (events will change, depending on the number of your playthrough)\n\nCons:\n\n- Reused sound assets\n- Switching to fullscreen is a bit annoying (I’m just slow. It took me awhile to realize F5 does this)\n- Not as scary as I would like\n\n---\n\nBy the way, if you have some time, watch me fool around in Wait - Extended.\n\nWait - Extended Video","October 29, 2015","true","3.5"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","0"

Not just among RPG-Maker games. And here is why.\nThe storyline is so unique and complex it makes everything come alive. The music is so skillfully made and placed that it absorbs you completely and creates a wonderfully fitting atmosphere. The amazing amount of detail the developers put into this, making every little object click-able and hiding this many secrets, stories, lore and references behind everything, it blows my mind.\n\nAnother reason I love this game is cause it doesn't give me the feeling of being spoon fed everything. If I gain an Achievement I had to actually do something. If I solve a riddle it's not always plain obvious. This game isn't hard and can be played casual. But having it on 100% is a real accomplishment, and fun.\n\nAnd like you turn of the lights for a good movie, please do so for this game. There is close to no jump-scares but there is lots of amazing, wonderful, creepy, feeling in this. A lot of games from the so called horror genre could learn a thing or two from this title in term of using other elements of fear like feeling alone or powerless, the unknown and all the others.\n\nAnd for everyone who likes H.P. Lovecraft this game is a must. The Elements of his world are clear to see in this game and yet it doesn't feel like his but like their story. I believe if he was alive he would applaud this game.\n\nAnd the only thing I can say about this game directly without spoiler. If you have not played it through several times you have not seen half of the game.\n\nIn appreciation of this masterful piece of game art I recommend this highly as on of the secret treasure of this years game releases.\n\nCheers\nA new fan","November 7, 2015","true","7.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

It just isn't like other horror games, in which some creepy visage jumps in your face and makes your liquids run. That's not real fear, it's just a scare.\n\nSure, „Wait“ has some small heart-stopping moments, like sudden noises and such, but that's not a main feature in my opinion.\nIt's more about the things you can't see or grasp.\nIs someone there? Did I just hear something? Creatures that just stand still without any reaction, looking at you...that's what I personally fear the most.\n\nOur protagonist is experiencing horrible nightmares in his own apartment and needs your help to find out what's going on, although all he wants is to go to work and eat his salad afterwards.\nWhat I love about him is the way just accepts things. Furniture is changing is his apartment while he is at work and he can't do anything about it. So why panic? Somehow he calms you with his pragmatic attitude in the midst of these unsettling nights.\n\nAfter some play time you really get into the story and want to hunt every breadcrumb of information, which can be found in any object.\nIf you're too lazy to explore and try different things you'll probably miss out on most of the fun, so be observant, as no information is useless.\n\nThe puzzles are challenging and force you to use your brain and be perceptive, read something carefully or even to take up a pen and write some notes for yourself. Wonderful.\n\nHere's a final advice: If you think the game is over, it's just the beginning.\nTwo hours of play time (aside from the sidestories) is not sufficient. :)","November 11, 2015","true","11.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","1"

It is 100% the perfect mix of Silent Hill and Lovecraft, as they promised it would be. The story is really not too captivating, but it's not like we are getting it from the mind of the man Lovecraft himself, but from a group of people who are absolute fans and are trying to make something 'similar', so I just respect the effort. But don't let that fool you, you won't be thinking about the story while playing this game, but about the experience. Boy, is this game creepy! That's just the best part. I don't know how they did it with these graphics, but I felt something I only felt when I played the Silent Hill games for the first time. That type of horror of 'what's going on here?' The atmosphere and the music are as suffocating as the SH first three games, packed with eerie feelings and weird things, dimensions, aliens, and rituals. If you like atmospheric horror, this is it for you!\nI just have one minor complaint though, and this I hope the developers read someday: you promised in the description of the game 'no jumpscares', but there are some. They are not too bad or heart attack inducing, but after reading your description I never expected to see any, and that dissapointed me a little. At the very first night the door slams in the darkness and that is cheap in my opinion, and too soon too. But I guess it works properly. That's my only MINOR complaint. The game is great otherwise.\n8/10","November 10, 2015","true","1.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It aims to provide a lasting horror experience that doesn’t rely on jump scares but the fear of the unknowable.\n\nThe game claims to be influenced by the works of H.P. Lovecraft, however it doesn’t so much show its influences on its sleeves so much as it wears a “I Love Innsmouth” shirt and a Cthulhu facemask. You follow the experiences of a man who every night experiences strange horrors that force him towards some unforeseen goal. The world becoming more and more warped as the numbers burnt into his wall tick down.\n\nWait is made in the RPG Maker engine, which may immediately put you off but if To the Moon and Stray Cat Crossing teach us anything it’s that we shouldn’t judge a game because it was made in RPG Maker. However, almost as a consequence of this, the game play itself is not very engrossing. Move around and explore to pick up items to rub on other items to advance the story.\n\nThe story itself is pretty solid. I’ll avoid spoilers but at first it seems fairly run of the mill Lovecraft horror. Strange things happen that nobody else seems to notice, there are hints at all-powerful beings and grotesque creatures chasing, you but always just out of sight. It’s only when you finish the game for the first time that a lot of it is revealed and you see the depth hidden within it. There are five different chapters, where each one is similar but distinctly different alongside side stories and plenty of hidden secrets. It’s also got a fantastic soundtrack that fits perfectly with the unfolding mystery.\n\nThe game does fall down however when it comes to the protagonist. He seems far too complacent, and it breaks the feel of the game. Pushing through to the later playthroughs can prove a lot of effort if you’ve not been immediately grabbed by the story and in all honestly a lot of the story feels somewhat generic.\n\nWait did not leave me with anything in the way of a lasting sense of dread or fear, but then again neither did any of Lovecraft’s works. Perhaps its best not to take the relatively low score that I have given this game at face value. This is a game that is well made and interesting but rather esoteric in its appeal. For some people I think this is exactly what they’re looking for, and if you love a bit of psychological horror then you should absolutely give this game a look. For most people however I’d say that this game is a safe pass.","December 5, 2015","true","5.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

And I hate horror games. Still, to say I love Wait-Extended, is an understatement.\n\nThe world of Wait-Extended ("Wait" for short) relies on subtlety and suggestion to tell a complex story, suffused with existentialism. There are multiple layers of meaning in the unfolding events, and engrossing sidestories to complement the main plot.\nThis exploratory adventure builds on its fair share of literary background.  There are even enigmatic easter eggs to be found throughout, which hint at an even bigger, more macabre picture than what you get to see within the storyline itself.\n\nThe game appears simple, understated and unassuming at first, and then it slowly but surely gets under your skin. It has you puzzling over its various mysteries long after you've stopped playing, and keeps you coming back for more. In fact, multiple playthroughs are ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY to get the full goodness of this game.\n\nWait has clearly been lovingly  crafted with incredible attention to detail. Everything you might encounter was put there on purpose. Nothing's been left to chance- if it makes no sense at first, trust that there's a reason why it is that way. If you're considering playing, here's my advice - take nothing for granted. Leave no stone unturned.

I'm sure this varies from person to person based on tolerance, however, I'd say the designers have done a great job creating an eerie and creepy atmosphere.

Those are the numbers on the wall of your apartment. The whole story from  Wait -  Extended  revolves around those four numbers. Benjamin currently living in the department sees them every day. He tried to erase them but nothing worked. It seems as they are magically fixed on that spot on the wall. And then one day he comes home from work and the numbers for the first time ever have changed. And with this change his world will be turned upside down.\n\nWait -  Extended  is mostly a text- and story-driven adventure game with some puzzle elements thrown in. Most of the puzzles are solvable with a bit of logic and intuition. Most of the time although you are running around in the apartment trying to figure out the larger picture of what is happening. The game is hereby divided into short day and night sequences.\nIgnoring the simple graphic the game has a suspenseful atmosphere for two reasons: The first is that there is the possibilty to die. It doesn't happen to often and you can restart at the last save point (rarely more than 5 minutes of play time back) but you can die. So you are always fearing for your life. The second reason is the lack of information and you need to play to the very end to get the complete picture. After 5-6 day and night sequences the game will reach its conclusion. And after this you will notice directly (and it is stated on the shopsite as well) that this is not the end. With the second cycle you then start to feel a bit like the protagonist: Was it like this before? Somehow this seems strange? Can I change the result?\n\nWait -  Extended  is an interesting game and the overlaying storyline is good enough to get you keep going to the end. To play through all cycles you need probably around 6-8 hours if you don't rush like a mad man. If you are trying to get the achievements (and you didn't look them up before starting to play the game) you probably need another two hours. I would recommand that you play through the complete game without prior information. After you have finished it you can return to earlier cycles in order to collect missed stuff. All in all I think the game is recommendable although you should not expect much of a game but more of a horror novel with interactive elements.\n\nPS: If you have questions just post them here and I'll try to come back at them as fast as possible.","April 21","true","13.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
