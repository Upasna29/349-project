I really want to love this game to bits. It creates a really interesting small scale tactical experience that I've never seen in another game. It is not a shooter. Don't expect something like Conflict Desert Storm.\n\nThe problem is this game is fairly broken. There's horrendous performance issues and the sound is bugged to hell.\n\nThe performance issues are largely caused by the game constantly trying to contact a server that no longer exists. To find this you can add the following line to your hosts file: "127.0.0.1 fswpc.available.gamespy.com"\n\nIf you don't know what a hosts file is you probably shouldn't try to attempt this. It's a system file and that means it's serious business.\n\nThe sound problems have no simple fix. You'll just have to live with constantly glitched sound if you want to experience this game.","November 26, 2013","true","3.0"," 55 of 67 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","55","67","0","0"

Is it a third-person cover-based shooter? Is it a strategy game? Is it a puzzle game? It is a unique combination of all three that combined forms a whole greater than its parts. Unfortunately, gamers expecting  a single genre tended to be discouraged by this unusual mix and the game never got the recognition it deserved.\n\nDespite its age - and all the technical difficulties that entails running it on a modern PC - the game's visuals remain surprisingly attractive, and it is not difficult to lose oneself in the fantasy of a fighting through the streets of the war-torn Middle East. There numerous incidental animations - be it a civilian scurrying for shelter, birds scattering as you approach or the laundry flapping in the wind - make the game's world seem alive and keep you on your toes at the same time.\n\nBut it's the gameplay that is the real star; leading my two squads through the dangerous, twisting streets of fictional Zekistan felt more realistic and true-to-life than all the Calls of Duty - or even Arma - games combined. Your crew's limited toolset - a handful of movement and attack options - are more than sufficient to engage and defeat the enemy if combined with a bit of cunning. It is almost puzzle like; "If I move fireteam Alpha /here/ and then toss smoke like this, the enemy will react like /that/, allowing me to maneuver fireteam Bravo into position /there/!" Figuring out the optimal method to not only kill the enemies but also do so in a way that minimizes casualties and ammunition use is amazingly  satisfying (fortunately, for those less talented, you can often "brute-force" your way through most challenges). The game's difficulty curve is gradual and never overwhelming.\n\nThe AI is not particularly skilled but can at times be gratingly tenacious, and failing to keep your team in cover will often result in the quick loss of several soldiers. Fortunately, the tangos' skill set is even less complex than that of your troops - mostly they just hunker down behind some cover and take potshots at you, although a few do use grenades - but they make up for this deficit with numbers and being well placed. Attempt to maneuver around them and they often - but not always - will seek new shelter, requiring you to trap them between your two teams coming at them from different directions. The occasional heavy weapon (rocket launcher or machine gun), tank or technical adds to the challenge and variety. Unfortunately - and this is the greatest fault of the game - the initial locations of the enemies is hard-coded into each level, which greatly reduces the replayability of the game. Best of all, once the mission is over, you can watch a replay to relive your successes (or failures), and even - should you chose - jump into the action at any point. Would that other games offered this feature!\n\nReleased in 2004, Full Spectrum Warrior can be difficult to get working on modern computers; in my case, I had to edit my HOSTS file, tinker with the soundcard settings and muck around in a configuration file before I got acceptable performance from the game. Even then, the dialogue was filled with pops and crackles. Nonetheless, the quality of the game was well worth the effort.\n\nFull Spectrum Warrior remains one of the forgotten classics of gaming and those willing to go into the experience with an open mind will be well rewarded with a challenging and exciting game.\n","November 30, 2013","true","12.7"," 38 of 42 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","38","42","0","0"

So far there has not been any attempt to provide an official forum sticky of contacting for support regarding games they now own the best way to  contact them is to reach them via the store page and look under info. I' am operating with Win 7 Home edition. The game works alright but just a warning this is an older title so this will not be the "best" in sound or video by todays standards. There are common reports of audio "clicking" or the game completely unable to start. So please make sure to check with Nordic Games about issues with graphics, OS, or any other problem. This game is ONLY compatible with Windows XP, 2000. So even if you run this program in compatibility mode it still might not work. I use to play this game on the original Xbox back in 2005 I believe.\n\nI had alot of fun when I played this before and for me this game had alot of replay factor. I still have not played the 2nd one yet but I do own both. I found that using a controller was easier for this game's mechanics involving orders and camera movment. It is not so bad using the keyboard and mouse, just have to get use to it.\n\nAs this title is around 10 years old, I would recommend you look elsewhere for a newer game. Your time (and money) will be better spent.\n\nIn the end the choice is all up to you. Thanks for reading!\n\nJay","April 20, 2014","true","3.6"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Anyone questioning my PC should consider that the begging screen (when they show the publisher/dev) shouldn't have been going at such a low frame rate (taking minutes for a 15 - 20 second animation) regardless of my hardware. Even at the lowest setting I could run this at, it the framefrate really tanked.

The backbone of a ground invasion is the U.S. Army Infantry, and in the midst of combat, their skills, courage, and teamwork are put to the test.\n\nWhile readiness continues to be the U.S. Army's top priority, how it goes about its business is changing. Full Spectrum Warrior began as a training aid for the U.S. Army to reinforce Army doctrine and team effort within the troops. It is the most realistic portrayal of Infantry-level urban warfare via unique tactical action gameplay. Players become the Squad Leader, commanding Alpha and Bravo squads. There is potential for danger down every alley, behind every window. Watch those angles folks, we've got a job to do here. Hooah!\n\n- Unique combination of tactical and action gameplay.\n- Authentic implementation of U.S. Army Infantry doctrine.\n- Simple control scheme lets you command eight soldiers in real time.\n- Squad equipment reflects real weaponry and equipment currently in use by the U.S. Army.\n- Immersive urban environments with danger around every corner.\n- 2-player co-op, each player controls one fire team.\n- Includes 2 exclusive bonus levels not available on Xbox.","November 20, 2013","true","43.2"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","5","19","0","0"

But please note that this was released 2005 for PC. I played it on the Xbox. The gameplay is good, you really need a tactic instead of just rushing the battlefield. The dialogue is pretty cool aswell, since the characters has their own personalities. I recommend this to anyone that likes a strategic shooter.","November 12, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact, this is more strategy than shooter. It's only a shooter in that your camera always chases the team you are controlling (or commanding) and have free control in throwing or firing grenades. But it works very well. And I like how the tactics you use resemble US Army doctrine (though can someone who served in the Army verify this?). Plus, your characters can be real funny too. My only complaint is that sometimes when one of your soldiers gets incapacitated, they fly and spin. But this is a lovely game. It's been a decade since this was released and I cannot find a game like it.\n\nOh, and I'm using Win 8.1. No problems!","August 18, 2015","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
