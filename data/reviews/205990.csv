But I cannot recommend this new release.  It is basically window dressing on the old game without addressing any of its faults.  Aside from the revamped spell research, nothing that couldn't be provided in DLC. Oh it's got more, more pictures, more units and two new races. If you don't mind paying $30 (or $40) for your DLC then hop on board.  But if you were looking to address the fundamental issues (above) then don't waste your time and money.\n\nThere is actually one group I can recommend it to and that is those that liked the Armaggedon DLC.  They didn't fix the pathing or the horrible NPC AI. (I think the monster AI got some tweaks) But their solution to those looking for a challenge is to introduce a whole slew of tough Spirit damage dealing monsters and unload wave after wave of monster spawns; very much in the spirit of Armaggedon.  The larger your territory the larger your clean-up issues.  As a plus you don't have to worry about your actual economy since the frequent spawns will keep you swimming in gold and mana.","March 22, 2014","false","38.0"," 444 of 539 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","444","539","0","8"

It has more races, more building and unit options, and an improved interface but they aren't really enough to make it a game in its own right. The main scenario is interesting but it suffers from the issue that many strategy games do where they compensate for the AI being a bit dumb by throwing huge numbers of units at you instead. As you approach the finale, 10 or so high level units randomly spawn across your lands every turn making that part of the game a frustrating grind.\n\nBasically not enough new content to justify a new game, I would stick with Warlock 1.","March 30, 2014","false","34.1"," 261 of 314 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","261","314","0","9"

Sadly we don't have much resources for this game anymore. There are some brave souls working on the Linux/Mac version. But that's about it for now I'm afraid."\n\nSo that is Apr 2014 - Oct 2015. (Last meaningful update in OCT) Something to bear in mind, considering its bugs since release.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUpdate 7/2/15 Still working my way thro latest campaign evaluating current state. Looking promising so far.Video series below.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUpdate 01/11/14 New mini campaign "Wrath of the Naga"  - currently evaluating changes, see video below.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUpdate - 04/10/14 No new expansions or additions to change this recommendation so far. Just the tweaks to fix spawn rate as detailed below, some ai fixes (needed), the controllable city changes(see below). Ingame store has been removed: http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?803742-No-more-in-game-store!-The-contents-will-be-made-available-through-other-means-later!\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFirst off, this is not a sequel, its warlock 1 with a few new features. Limited fully controllable cities ( can now be toggled on/off in sandbox, warlock 1 mode). Different research mechanics ( see below ), 2 new races and a single player campaign ( think portal worlds from warlock 1 linked together ). Same pointless diplomacy ( NA, Alliance, Declare War, Repeat).\n\nI love the original but the problem here is this feels like paying again for the exact same game. Put it in sandbox mode and you would be very hard pressed to tell the difference looking at it. This should have been an expansion. £44.99 for the base game and 0 day dlc..... It staggers my mind.\n\nIf you own warlock 1 your not missing anything and should wait for a reduction in price. If you dont own the original this one has most of the features of the original (no armageddon mode but thats understandable) with slightly different mechanics for research (more choice in the order of research with a view of what to research later) and  a horrendous amped up spawn system in exiled mode (thank god now its adjustable).\n\nUnfortunately I cant recommend this based on the price. I desperately want this to do well but i cant in all honesty support this growing trend of releasing what is essentially the same game for a premium price.\n\nWrath of the Naga playthrough currently in progress:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kREHPjEIR_8&index=1&list=PLVKQE26VpEIDDWcsVip-zSzoyh3q_7x0G&channel=letsplaykherny\n\nSeries focusing on the Naga race:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIlKJbsoUp0","April 22, 2014","false","95.9"," 118 of 134 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","118","134","0","4"

For some reason I thought it was included in my original review, I was mistaken. Disabling it does make the experience a lot more like the first game and more fun in my eyes. Also tried to fix some spelling errors – no excuses for those.\n\nI wish I could recommend Warlock 2. I really liked the first game as a cheap, fun little Civ clone with a bigger focus on combat. I thought number 2 would address some of my complaints about the first game or at least change things up. But what I didn't like about Warlock 1 remains and also has some new annoyances: bare-bones diplomacy system, random AI opponent decisions (really alliances don't matter - you'll end up warring and clashing with everyone), limiting how many perks you can give to units, enemies spawning inside your territory at random times (especially when it decides to create enemies FAR too powerful you to deal with), random quest spawning that creates enemies that you need to fight, even if you refuse those quests...the list sadly goes on.\n\nAnd while I understand the new Unrest rules and city limit, Warlock pretty much thrived on expanding and creating more and more cities and the Unrest system pretty much makes it so you need to play it small. And considering how massive some of the worlds can be you'll run out of effective cities really quickly. That means you need to convert old cities into special cities: free cities (like Civ puppet cities, only they only generate an insignificant amount of gold, fortress cities (which is pretty much a range 3 tower) or religious cities (which give a small amount on mana and improve relations with the chosen god). Maybe if people don’t like managing large amounts of cities they'll enjoy this focus but for me it just didn't work.\n\nI did have some fun with Warlock 2. In the 70 hours I put into it I really liked going through portals and discovering new worlds in the Exiled mode. But honestly if you need a fantasy 4X game go with Civ 5 (with some of the fantasy mods), Fallen Enchantress and Warlock 1. If you do want to play 2, I recommend a really big steam sale.","November 16, 2014","false","70.9"," 171 of 208 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","171","208","9","8"

Almost everything about this game is an improvement on the previous game (Warlock master of the arcane), but it isn't enough to justify it being a whole new game for this price. From what I've seen so far this could have just been a big dlc/add on/expansion, or something the modding community worked hard on.\nI suppose the best example that comes to mind is XCOM: Enemy unknown and XCOM: Enemy within. There's enough difference between the two for it to be an expansion, but not a whole new game.\n\nPlease don't misunderstand, this is a good game but if you already own Warlock master of the arcane, I'd say wait until this goes on sale before you pick it up.\n\nP.S. this is early access, so there might be enough in the full release to justify a whole new game.

It is a lot of fun, though not without serious flaws. My review is based on three (partial) plays of "The Exiled" story mode, and one full playthrough in "Battle for the Outplanes" mode.\n\nA big complaint a lot of people have is that it seems like a content update, rather than a sequel to Warlock. This is true to an extent. However, the handling of the planes was the biggest flaw of Warlock 1 but seems to be the central appeal of Warlock 2. In Warlock 1, there were other planes, and they were full of big bad monsters, but they weren't very interesting and the rewards for going there weren't significant enough to bother with them. A game of Warlock 2, on the other hand, has a hierarchy of planes, where you (and your A.I. opponent mages) start on less threatening planes, and you work your way down through to planes with significantly more dangerous fauna (and sometimes flora), or back up the hierarchy to fight the other great mages. Each plane has its own unique flavor, and most special resources only occur in one or two types of plane. The special resource thing is key... most races don't have strong research-producing buildings, so you need to chase after the research-producing resources, which tend to be a couple planes down from where you start. The first time I reached a Shadow Plane, and established a fortress there to defend myself against the horrible shadowy horrors that awaited me, it felt ... well... I would say "epic", but that word is way overused these days. But it was awesome.\n\nI was also impressed with how much the game made me care about terrain, and provided a multitude of terraforming spells that I actually want to use. The ability to throw up a mountain where I want a defensive chokepoint, or to raise up a landbridge when I want to cross an ocean is quite empowering.\n\nThe big flaws of the game, are that the AI is quite poor (and the game is pretty easy in general), and that the game gets tedious once you have a big empire.\n\nPlanar portals provide your primary military chokepoints in the game. The A.I. takes advantage to this to an extent, in that it's smart enough to build fortifications on its side of a portal. However, it's really bad at launching offenses through portals. If you stay perpetually at war with an A.I., it will continually send a trickle of one or two units at a time through the portal to be slaughtered on the other side. The only threat the A.I. can pose, is if you let it build up during peacetime, and send a large number of units through at a time. If you let this happen, A.I. units will pop up in funny places as they exit at the nearest unoccupied hex on your side of the portal.\n\nThe late-game tedium arises mostly from troop movements. Moving troops across your empire takes an awfully long time when you're spread out across several planes. I don't trust the pathfinding of the game to do it for me, as it often works rather poorly (though this is somewhat understandible technical hurdle, given the many movement modes of units, as well as all of the terraforming). One thing about the game alleviates some of the late-game tedium though. You are limited in the number of normal cities you can have at once (starting at five, and increasing with research). But you can also have an unlimited number of special cities, which are less beneficial than a normal city, but require no management. Managing cities doesn't become a slog, because you typically only have 5-10 of them that ever need any attention.\n\nThe story mode ("The Exiled") is cool the first time, but is essentially the same each time you play.\n\nMy plays thus far:\n\n1. Exiled Mode, average difficulty, small multiverse, two opponents.  I was friendly with the other great mages and focused on the storyline. I had a lot of fun exploring the game for the first time, but ultimately got bored while fighting through the penultimate plane (which is full of tough monsters, but is way too big and unvaried to hold my interest) and quit.\n\n2-3. Exiled mode, hard diffuculty, small and medium multiverses, max opponents. Did some conquering of great mages and had fun conquering my first few planes, but ultimately got bored.\n\n4. Battle for the Outplanes mode, impossible difficulty, small multiverse, two opponents. I played this one all the way through . I had quite a bit of fun with it, but was overall very dissapointed with just how easy I could conquer the "Impossible AI" opponents.\n\nI'm off to try Sandbox mode next. I'm hoping the A.I. will handle it a bit better.","July 11, 2014","true","223.5"," 79 of 88 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","79","88","0","0"

Another beef that I have with the game is that you spend FAR more time fighting against the endlessly spawning "wandering monsters" than you ever do against your fellow wizards and that brings an absurd amount of randomization into the overall strategy of the game. The endless spawning also tends to make things drag on in the end-game, long outlasting its welcome.\n\nOn the plus side, the game has a fine sense of humor and the visuals and audio are a treat (although it seems that much of the music was recycled from Warlock 1 as well).","March 27, 2014","false","12.1"," 94 of 118 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","94","118","0","0"

If you're a lover of 4X strategy games and fantasy lore, get this game -- you won't be sorry.\n\nOne of the reasons this game has so many harsh ratings is because it can be a little buggy. But on the right system (Windows 7, 8 and 10 all work well), it's a ton of fun and you'll encounter few bugs. I can safely say this after 2000+ hours of game play.\n\nHowever, the Linux and Mac versions do not work. The developers were forced to abandon the game before they were fixed, so avoid this game if you're using one of those OS's.\n\n\nPROS\n------\n\nThere are more pros than I have time to list for this game, but here are the ones that stick out the most:\n\n- Tons of flavorful units\n- Varied races\n- Simple but highly strategic combat system\n- Wide variety of fantasy resources\n- Interesting spells\n- Great game modes (Sandbox is a single big map with subworlds; Battle for Outplanes is on "shard" worlds that offers an entirely different experience and is probably more beginner-friendly)\n- Challenging campaign modes\n- Rich and comical lore\n- Excellent replay value\n- Tons of fun -- one of the best games I've ever played (and I've played A LOT of games over the years)\n\n\nCONS\n------\n\nBUGS\n\nThere are a few subborn bugs and the developers are no longer able to work on the title to fix them. On Windows, none of the bugs are truly game-breaking.\n\nTo give you an idea, roughly 1 in 20 games I've played have crashed at some point. (Games are usually 20+ hours long.) The good news is that you can usually "correct" a game-crash bug by loading an autosave from just a turn or two prior and doing your turn a little differently.\n\nNote that there are also a few mods that fix a number of minor bugs -- Renaissance Mod fixes many of them.\n\n\nSUBPAR AI\n\nAs a beginner, the AI seems quite strong. But once you know what you're doing, the AI is lackluster and you'll catch it making some bone-headed moves, even on the most difficult setting.\n\nAgain, a few mods exist that have improved the AI -- Legendary Mode AI is one and Renaissance Mod is another. The AI still makes the occasional poor move, but the games themselves are much more challenging with either of these mods.\n\n\nNOT FOR LINUX / MAC\n\nDespite what the description says, users agree that the game is not in a playable state for Linux and Mac users.\n\n\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN WARLOCK 1\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe first Warlock was widely criticized on two counts:\n\n1) It looked like a Civ 5 clone. True, it does have a very similar feel to the UI in Civ 5, and it has retained this feel for the sequel. But the gameplay is quite different than a Civ title, with only slight similarities.\n\n2) The game lacked strategic depth. To win, all you really needed to do was to "city spam" your way to victory. There was no downside for having multiple cities, making most games feel like a race to see who could expand the fastest.\n\nYou could also "perk" (buff) as many units as you wanted just by capturing a single resource tile.\n\nWarlock 2, however, changed both of these things for the better by adding some much-needed limitations.\n\n\nGREATER LIMITATIONS\n\nSome people who enjoyed the freedom Warlock 1 granted with regards to city spamming and limitless unit perks are likely to be turned off by the sequel. I know I was... until I learned how to "replay" the game.\n\nIn fact, fans of the first title pushed back so hard on the city limit that the developers even added the ability to turn this off when you create a new game. But just as the developers noted that disabling the city limit is "not recommended," I will echo the same. The gameplay is so much richer with some scarcity and consequences for overextending -- just as it is in the best 4X games.\n\n\nMORE STRATEGIC DEPTH\n\nAs I learned to play with the newly laid out limitations on number of cities and availablity of perks, along with the new unrest system, I discovered that the developers really did know what they were doing. The game has TONS more strategic depth with these limitations in place. So again -- take some of these negative reviews with a grain of salt.\n\nThe developers really did a lot to improve the game with these simple changes. When people say Warlock 2 is just a clone of Warlock 1, they are sorely mistaken.\n\n\nMUCH IMPROVED RESEARCH TREE\n\nIn Warlock 1, researching spells is entirely random. When it's time to research a new spell, you're given a small selection of random spells and are able to chose one.\n\nThe sequel offers an actual research tree, with clearly laid out paths to acquire new spells. This gives you the ability to navigate the tree and see all the spells, allowing you to strategically chose your preferred research path. Many players consider this the best improvement over the original.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n-----------\n\nAside from World of Warcraft, I don't think I've ever spent so much time playing (and enjoying) a game.\n\nIs Warlock 2 perfect?\n\nNo.\n\nThe cons I described above should be fair warning to those who are concerned about getting this game.\n\nIs Warlock 2 worth your time and money?\n\nYES. Absolutely.\n\nSure, It does have some imperfections -- many of which I've managed to correct myself in my own popular mod for the game, Renaissance Mod:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=493257789\nNote that Renaissance adds loads of fun new content to the game, too.\n\n\nTL;DR - If you're running Windows and you love fantasy and 4X games, get this game and the DLC -- especially if it's on sale. You'll be doing yourself a disservice not to give it a try.\n\nIf it was as bad as some of these other reviews would have you believe, there wouldn't be such a loyal fanbase for the game.","November 12, 2015","true","739.4"," 57 of 64 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","57","64","2","12"

Secondary, I'm a latecomer, so by now I have not observed any issues and bugs that no doubt where present at launch - at the current date of September 2015 the game works just fine, excluding the odd twist of slowing down your typing if you alt tab out of it, nothing else is affected as far as I can tell. And thirdly I picked it up on sale with a huge Paradox bundle, so my expectations where not colored by trying to figure out if I got my moneys worth.\n\nHaving sad all that I found the game highly enjoyable, what sets it aside from other 4x is the spell casting system that lets you take very active role in the world, up to and including fully transforming it, you are a great mage and you do feel like one playing it.\nThe unit verity is great, attention to details and races is very noticeable, the world is deep and detailed and well thought through (it is the world of Majesty 1 & 2 btw.) the sense of humor is subtle and clever and does not get in the way of immersion.\nThe IA is uncomplicated - it is unlikely to wipe you out but can put up a fight if you are the one going against it, yet the spells can make it a very interesting multiplayer experience.\n\nDo keep in mind that if you played a 4x before you need to start on Challenging difficulty or higher, normal is really designed for people who don't get the principle behind the game at all - you as a player have an inherit advantage over AI so it needs a boost desperately.\nAnd remember to concentrate on quality instead of quantity - spawning a horde of tiny low upkeep units does not work well with having to travel through portals :)\n\nOh yes, and DLC - the Naga expansion is done quite well - another fun and unique race and a game mode that is quite different from the rest (can be very frustrating thou if you are not playing as naga yourself, take the "clean land" spell at the start or you will suffer).

In exiled mode, there are a few critical quests that can break via various common conditions in game, causing them to never be able to be completed. Though it won't halt your progress, it may create cripplingly challenging conditions (Think of all the land you own slowly falling into the ocean turn by turn.) that can be impossible to recover from. The AI behaves much like a stuntman running through glass windows, and it can create an unintentional mess (Or is it intentional?) when an AI settler barges into a dangerous dimension and invites an army of shadow dragons into your shard to do battle with  your tier 1 archers. Much of the game seems to be the luck of the draw, and though I do enjoy hitting my head against that brick wall over and over, I don't see the fun a strategy enthusiast less masochistic than me would have with it.

In our game all except one were solid land and one was continents. Most of them were tiny.\nAI is dumber than W1 - it can't pass over water, lower mountains. So it's even possible to lock AI in home shard by raising mountains around portal. AI does build good units, it does not use them, for example human mages with range 3 are often in front line.\n\nLate game (150+ turn) offers no challenge, only annoyance with easy-to-kill-hard-to-find-them-all low-tier units like red dragons, undead and so on. Shadow dragons and spiders do offer some chllenge but could be ignored by just killing United One ppl - cause they're so weak, we got them all with 2 rainbow dragons, 3 legendary heroes and 2 starting heroes.

Think Civ 4 with magic instead of nukes, werewolves instead of tanks, and heroes that kill everything. The only real difference is that YOU have the power. Any single creature on the map is ultimately powerless against the almighty Great Mage (you). They are unable to attack you directly, leaving you to cast hellfire and lay waste to your enemies. However, you are not alone. Others like you have taken up their roles as leaders. It is a strategy game in which the king himself is not useless and everything is your pawn. It has diverse abilities for the Great mage. Abilities such as healing, fireball, frost nova, and even ones that allow you to modify tiles around you. Using this to your advantage you are to beat the other mages to a bloody pulp with your wit and charm... OR JUST RAMPAGE THROUGH EVERYTHING WITH AN OP ARMY OF GIANT HELIAN WEREWOLVES... or is that just me....\nAnyway, interactions with other mages can either lead you towards joint prosperity or a WAR. Random occurances can just as easily wipe out a city as any of your enemies. Oh, all your troops on the front lines? Have two annoying dragons harrass your Capital. It's alright. I'm sure you'll survive...\n\nGods are important, and thus your relation to them can alter the tides of battle in your favor. They can provide you with epic level units or give you a spell that can obliterate your enemy. With many Gods to choose from you will learn who suits your playstyle very easily.\n\nThere are several worlds that coincide with one another. These worlds are split up and can be navigated between via portals. There are several miniature locations all set around different biomes and then the main land. Ardiania. Fun place. Green grass, blue water, giant serpent monsters, massive spiders... You know, epic vacation level stuff. Beautiful terrain where everything seems to want to kill you. Why did you ever leave?\n\n\nTL;DR\nWarlock is one of those games you can spend hours at a time and never get bored. It never slows down and always has you focused on complete anihilation of your foes, or desperate survival from hordes of enemy forces. Every turn is something new. If the game slows down, it'll throw a personal quest at you, sometimes a band of misfits, maybe an elemental, or sometimes an enemy epic level creature that can eat a city in one turn.Anything Goes. It's mostly unexpected and on the harder difficulties any wrong step means certain death. Are you up for the challenge?\n\n\n\nFor those who know Warlock:\n\nUI is the same as Warlock 1, however, it has multiple modes, new races, new units, an actual storyline, and the best part? It is mod compatible, something the community of Warlock: Master of the Arcane asked for, for a long long time.\n\nAt first glance you might think "there isn't anything new here... It looks just the same.." but it makes it easy to just pick it up and go. If you are familiar with Warlock 1, this should be a cakewalk... With one exception. You mage is limited, you have to learn a specific number of spells in a few catagories in order to gain access to the more powerful ones beyond. These catagories are Wizardry, Sorcery, and Divine. This means you have to plan ahead, also... It means that the spells that you choose while customizing your wizard are actually worth choosing now and you are limited to 5 different choices, especially when what you want isn't what was listed as a choice.\n\nThe game is also modable. You can add your own race, units, heroes, and portraits for your own great mage.","October 3, 2014","true","41.5"," 65 of 83 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","65","83","0","0"

Extremely shabby practice.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nThis game seems to be very solid mechanically. I wish that what buildings were available was tied to a tech tree of some kind, but that's a minor complaint. What sticks out is that Warlock II solves the late game micro Hell of most 4X games without sacrificing early and mid expansion and development play by making it prudent to convert your cities into automated gold or mana or piety batteries. I think this is a brilliant design decision. Compare it to Civ V BNW. In BNW, hard nerfs to science left four to six cities optimal for most of the game, which means that decisions about city placement and development are kind of limited in scope. By mid game these cities will be strong enough to each build everything useful, and because there are so few multiplicative national or great wonders there's little incentive to specialize. Here, because you're constantly expanding outwards and throwing your initial core cities onto automated gold production, you have all kinds of opportunites to specialize your new settlements according to the local terrain and to make decisions about whether to maintain a well-built research city that puts you over your limit and will never be strategically useful as a unit production center.\n\nSo while I think this is one of the most ingenious design decisions I've seen in a strategy game lately, I can't recommend this game. First, there are major problems with the AI. I don't especially mind this because the game's emphasis seems to be on using your empire as an engine to reach and generate units powerful enough to defeat powerful NPC units rather than on direct competition with AI empires, but it bears mentioning that the enemy empire AI basically can't play the game.\n\nThe most major issue, though, is the huge array of bugs on the Mac and Linux ports. I bought this without looking into its technical side because I was under the impression that Paradox had really cleaned up its act in terms of publishing non-functional products, but these versions of the game are virtually unplayable. I was most hit by the fact that the quests system, which is integral to progress in some places, is completely broken on both platforms in both release and beta versions, but browsing the Paradox support forums reveals a huge number of other issues from broken saves to constant crashes. After the backlash Paradox has had from putting its name on busted stuff and its subsequent attempts to up the standards for both its in house development and its publishing side, it's extremely disappointing to see something in this state for sale. Presumably they're working on fixing these issues, but these ports have been out for months and are not playable in a meaningful way.","December 30, 2014","false","4.5"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","42","50","0","1"

Now paradox has always done fantastic games in the past, and Warlock 1 was absolutely amazing, so I hope one day this game will be worth the effort.  Maybe it's just because it's not fully unlocked yet, maybe the new features will come on April 10th, but as it stands right now, it really feels like the designers played Eador: Masters of a Broken World, and said "Hey, that's cool, let's do that for Warlock 2."  Except in the process, they missed the things that made Eador awesome, and failed to keep the good aspects of Warlock 1 in check.\n\nThe interface is glossy, and all the voice acting is virtually the same.  Most of the units sound like they're exactly what they were in Warlock 1.  Granted they added a few new races, so there are new sounds, but you'd figure they would try to entertain us somewhat with new material on old units.\n\nThey also tried to add the morality that is found in Eador.  They did this by giving us decisions where we could upset our people for gain, or make our people happy at a cost, but they fail to put anywhere near sufficient effort into the descriptors.  For examples, vampires invaded my city, and the description said one line about how vampires were at my front door.  And I had four options.  Fight, give in to their demands, or negotiate (the fourth option was grayed out).  Well I have no idea as the player what their demands are, all I see is the end result.  I don't know what I'd be negotiating, and fighting is pretty self explanatory.  In Eador it gives you paragraphs of knowledge about each event, making sure you know exactly what you're deciding on.  There is no evidence of that here.\n\nNext, they make the world much larger, and yet smaller at the same time.  Now that you have to portal jump between worlds just to get to other mages...you'd think cities and controlling borders would become easier and more important.  But alas, as they've increased the overall size of the world (though made smaller the majority of the floating shards, which is another concept from Eador..) they have put a cap as to how many cities you can control.  Even with some of the best research you can manage, this number might in a long game hit 10.  There are more worlds than that in a big enough map!  So how do they expect you to resolve this issue?  You can designate cities to be independent and just pay you a small tax as the great mage.  And while this sounds great at first, these cities do not produce food, they -never- expand their borders beyond the starting 1 hex size, and they will still require being defended by the units that you can't feed because none of these free cities produce food for your army.  Not to mention they don't always build on what little territory they have, so anything can spawn there if it wants, making the need to protect the home front even more important...with once again less food.\n\nNo, the game is not impossible.  No it's not filled with bugs.  In that aspect it is very much any other game by paradox.  But if you buy it, I think you'll agree that at the current moment in time, it's just lacking significant needs.  I'll be on Warlock 1 or Eador until I hear better news about this game, that's for sure.\n\nWith Regards,\nSea.","March 27, 2014","false","2.8"," 57 of 79 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","57","79","0","0"

As someone who has never played the first Warlock I absolutely highly recommend this version for fans of the 4x genre.  The main gripe I've read in reviews about this game is that it is so much like the first rendition of the game.  I personally can't verify that but if it is, I might think about buying that version too because I LOVE this game.\n\nIf you like Civ 5 you will like this.  It's basically the same game but with Fantasy lore.  There are some additional features like improved diplomacy, Heroes and quests.  I've found that different heroes are available for hire dependingn on my Factions Race.  I was the undead and I had the option of hiring a Giant Ogre.  I was the Planestriders in another game and had the option of hiring an Elemental Mage.  So many possibilities.  There are also outposts and/or castles that are occupied by neutral or hostile clans.  The technology, city building, and battles all play out similarly to Civ 5 with the exception of the ability to cast spells (And there are a lot of spells).  There are also a ton of units, and buildings etc.  The variety is almost overwhelming at times (But in a good way).\n\nWarlock 2 has all the pros of Civ 5 but with some added improvements as previously mentioned.  I don't have a single con for this game!  Not a one!!!\n\nWith that being said, I haven't touched on the best feature of the game yet.  The ability to mod anything and EVERYTHING!  You want a new Faction?  Do it!  You want new spells?  Do it!  You even want new races or units?  Do it!  New artefacts, Mages, and even buildings?  Yup, you can do that too!  You can even upload your own photos into the game to have whatever picture of your new Mage and/or Faction you may like!  It's absolutely incredible and simple to do!  I can actually see myself spending more time in the mods than the actual game lol.  However, if the mods aren't for you, the game in itself and the gameplay is great within itself.\n\nHighly highly recommend for any fan of the genre.","September 28, 2014","true","15.6"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","31","41","0","0"

It’s the same and better.\n\nI do not recommend this game, because I believe the previous game in the series, Warlock: Master of the Arcane is more fun. Even though this game tries to improve on the previous edition with more races, more features, and even some better systems, it also creates other problems that overshadow the improvements. Being less fun would be ok if this game was different from the original... it's not. Alot of the art and models are literally the same, the gameplay is almost identically, even entire tech trees for races remain the same. This game feels like a bunch of mods/dlc added to the old game instead of a new game. So since its not different and is worse, just get Warlock: Master of the Arcane.\n\nFirst, what the game got right, because credit where credit is due:\nSpell research is much improved over the previous edition. You pick and plan your spell research instead of being given 5 random options to pick from.\n\nMonster lair spawn rate can be adjusted to be less annoying in the late game, or you can have more of it if that's what your into.\n\nSome of the additional races, spells, perks, and resources add some complexity and are interesting.\nTemples allow you to gain reputation with specific gods, even in early/mid game.\n\nNow the bad:\nToo many strong neutral monsters are found everywhere. You're early game, the most crucial part of any run, depends almost entirely on whether you can find city locations away from strong mobs. Too make maters worse, sometimes monsters wander, so it's even more random whether you are going to get crushed. Worst of all, because the Player AI is not great, the neutral mobs end up being a more of a challange than your computer opponents, even on higher difficulties! I want to fight other Players not the environment! While this is somewhat true of W:MotA, its much worse in W:tE.\n\nThe unrest mechanic adds nothing. One new feature is that unrest can build in your cities which if it gets to 100 unrest overall leads to bad things. What bad things? I'm not sure, and neither is anyone else. Sometimes mobs spawn, sometimes growth is affected, sometimes... nothing. After looking online and trying to figure out how exactly it works, it seems to be pretty universally ignored mechanic. The only way to stiffle unrest is by slowing expansion and its simply not worth it. I've now completely ignored unrest for 3 games and have been no worse off for it.\n\nExiled mode is tedious. Like Armageddon mode in the previous version, now there is alternate mode that has different objectives to the normal game mode. But all you do is slug your way across many different "worlds" until you get to the final set of uber bosses. Once you have an economy going there is almost no chance of failure because you never get attacked, you just have to wait to build very powerful units to take on the bad guys. Its slow and requires almost no strategy.\n\nThe game help and info system sucks and there is too much complexity. With 20 something resources, which each may or may not have a unique application for each of the 7 different races, you find yourself having to constantly look at the tech tree. There is too much. If it all added something to the game, then maybe it would be worth it but often times you find that different units, with different upgrades, and different perks, do the exact same thing and are just as strong.\n\nIn conclusion, this game only adds minor improvements to the original while also adding many more unneeded features that just make it worse.","October 13, 2015","false","18.5"," 47 of 69 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","47","69","0","0"

I really did -- but the bottom line is that it is convoluted and stupid. Close up, the game is AWESOME. Lots of different units, spells, monsters... Plenty of everything you'd expect and desire in a game like this. Why does it suck? I'll give you some examples -- The campaign world is a series of linked world-shards, or planes, or whatever -- these are connected by gates. It may take several turns for a unit to travel from one connected plane to the next much less to a plane several links away. Your economy cannot support large stacks of units for every city you have on every plane -- so the bulk of your army has to be at the forefront of your campaign. However, no matter how domesticated the planes you conquer become, wild monsters always pop up there. You're forced to summon or send back units to places you've conquered over and over again. It also gets confusing which planes are connected where, and it just seems there should be an easier way to move around and control things. Also, city development is based on a flowchart where to build more sophisticated buildings you must have prerequisite buildings -- this is a common element in this genre of game. HOWEVER, despite this being done right in almost every other game where this is an element, it manages to somehow be opaque in this game what structures a city should have to enable you to build higher tier buildings -- you can either constantly refer to the flow chart button (annoying, and sometimes doesn't scroll anyway) or try to figure it out which the tutorial itself says is just going to lead to frustration and wasted effort. Why not have the city building be done ON THE FLOWCHART, then? Beats the bloody hell out of me. Instead you're wondering why one city you have can only build a million craftsman districts while another one can have a bank and a mint in it... is it because the other city in question has a granary? WHY THE HELL SHOULD THAT MATTER, and if it does why isn't it more obvious!?

It also gets increasingly clunky the more you have on the go to manage movement, especially with allies units involved - you'll wind up being blocked by their units from reaching goals - or using your units to block them.\n\nAll in all, it's a mediocre title that falls short of many similar titles already out - Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes and Eador: Masters of the Broken World are titles that share a good deal in common with this one (Eador's "shards" and Warlocks are strikingly similar) - but both of those titles do a better job than this one, in my opinion.\n","October 17, 2014","false","3.9"," 46 of 71 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","46","71","0","0"

There are no sweeping changes here, there are no completely different mechanics, there's no arbitrary new mini-game that fundamentally alters how you play.  Warlock 2 takes all of what made the original fun and polishes it, adds to it, develops, evolves and improves.  City and army building has been greatly improved with more transparency of 'tech trees', unit-improvement resources are now handled better and spell research is leaps and bounds better, with direct and clear choices offered to the player at each step of the way.\n\nWhile many of the art and sound assets  are direct from the first iteration, everything seems just a little more nicely rendered, a little more well built and just, well, better.  The UI is clearer, there is far more help available in-game and everything seems more to-hand than the original did.  With the new game mode and the editor, the wider selection of races and units, there's a lot of content to explore and consume before the well runs dry.\n\nOverall, this game is a superb example of what happens when you build a sequel not by reaching for new faddish quirks, by trying to cater to the lowest common denominator or by bloating the game up with reams of pointless minutiae that require advanced statistics and spreadsheets to manage, but by playing the game and understanding that the game was already fundamentally good and simply tweaking and polishing and improving every point.\n\nIf you liked the original, you will love Warlock 2: The Exiled.  If you didn't like the original, there's a very good chance that whatever put you off has been addressed and improved in this new edition.","April 14, 2014","true","163.7"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","0"

Warlock II: The Exiled surpasses it every way! First let's talk about changes! Spells now have a meaningful tech tree and this tree is expecially useful as spells are grouped such that researching stage one spells for instance will unlock access to stage two spells - more powerful - and so on. Also, depending upin what you research, you gain favor with certain gods and disfavor among others. If you play Magic: The Gathering, think of the color pie on the back of a card. If you curry favor with a god, you also gain some favor with the godto the left and right ofit while simultaneously losing favor with opposition gods. I really like this mechanic as it really makes you think about your spell research more carefully, that is to say, youare not just thinking of your immediate offense and defense but also the longer term metagame.\n\nGone are the downward planes. Instead, similar to Eador: Masters of the Broken World, you play on "shards" and portals must be found that connect to other worlds. Space game vets who remember Conquest: Frontier Wars will remember this type of mechanic. And unlike Eador, in this game, you are creating a power base that carries over seamlessly to each new plane you visit. But, the futher you move away, the shards become (naturally) more dangerous. I like Eador, but, THIS is the superior game - the game Eador SHOULD have been.\n\nQuests are numerous and interesting and the game retains a nice bit of humor, but happily, it feels a little more serious than the first Warlock. Even if you are a Warlock I veteran, I would advise you to play the tutorial to get comfortable with the changes.","March 20, 2014","true","1.9"," 58 of 101 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","58","101","0","4"

Is it a reboot? Is it both? Is there even a difference?  I have followed the game online for months and there is no general consensus. I could not form my own opinion until the game was ported to OSX in late October ’14. Now I’m finally going to set my sights on Ardania. I have a score to settle. I seek revenge. I’m going to wipe out the other great expats of Ardania, and seek control. But first, I have to fight the non-stop hordes of monsters that spawn everywhere. I have a schizophrenic AI to tame, it’s time to break out my wizard hat. Let’s begin.\n\nTL;DR: If you wanted a true sequel to the surprise that was Warlock 1, you’ll be very disappointed. At best, Warlock 2 is a polished Warlock 1 with a bit more content added. Granted, it was ported to MAC, but in it’s current state it is a broken mess. Warlock 2 is probably only worth buying on sale at a deep discount.\n\nYou might like this game if:\n\nYou’ve always wanted to play a fantasy 4X game that mirrors a lot of what Civilization 5 does but with an even more neurotic AI.\nYou like having a plethora of choices with faction units and don’t mind that they don’t look graphically up-to-date.\nYou like the idea of one unit per tile and possibly prefer it over the “stack of doom”.\nYou just want more of the same Warlock, with some minor upgrades and additions.\n\nYou might NOT like this game if:\n\nYou like having meaningful diplomacy. None to be had here.\nYou like your AI opponents to give you a challenge in single player.\nYou enjoy stable games (on a MAC).\nYou’re looking for a game that dares to be different.

There's minor differences here and there, but unless you squint really hard, it's still the same game.  The units are the same, the spells are the same, the voice clips are the same, the soundtrack is the same, and even the ridiculous AI is the same.  The biggest feature to the new game, the world shard system, has been more annoying than anything.  It's such a chore getting your units from shard to shard, and it takes 'forever' to do so when you have a large army, because you're constantly bottle-necking at the portals.  I can only see it getting worse and worse as I'm forced to travel to more and more shards.\n\nI really like Warlock, and Warlock 2 is fun (because it's the same thing, essentially), but I don't recommend paying the full price for it.

Its always been the most tedious aspect of Civ for me and not where its charms lie.  So you're left with war(lock)mongering to victory against a bunch of randomly spawning mobs and if i'm going to do that, then i'd just rather play Civ which is just a much deeper game.\n\nIt doesn't help that there doesn't seem to be much community around the game either.  r/warlock is just dead.\n\nStill if Civ style hex-based combat  is your thing or you just really wanted Civilization : Fantasy Tropes edition, then you might well enjoy it a lot more.

This game isn't for everyone its quite slow paced and the mulitplayer is a completely different beast from the single player.

The game has traditional 4x gameplay in a fantasy setting, with hex-based territory management and some interesting spins on the world map and city management.  There are even some very nice quality-of-life features, like the building progression map or the spell book.  These features are all very competantently implemented; the problem is that the previous game did these exact same things as well.  In terms of game rules and over graphics, the game is essentially the same, aside from a new game mode entitled Exiled mode, which puts a new spin on the classic Campaign paradigm used in such games.  However, aside from all that, I dont think there is enough here to justify someone who owned the original to upgrade to the sequel.  I enjoy this game a great deal, and if this is your first foray into the Warlock series, do buy it, as its a fantastic title, I just dont know if returning Warlock players would be justified in spending $30 price tag for a game that is essentially a DLC updated version of the original.","April 11, 2014","true","37.1"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

Exiled mode is merely a focused string of 'pocket dimensions' (that already existed in the first game) in a campaign format -- no more innovation than the Armageddon mode for Warlock 1.  The other improvements and additions are arguably ones that should have been included in a patch or, at most, a $10 DLC.  Unrest is the only truly new mechanic and its implementation is primarily intended to cap the number of cities you can build.  This ultimately has little bearing on the game as you can win on even the hardest difficulty with a few lords and a couple of complimentary units.\n\nThe Great Mage edition for $50 is particularly laughable as it merely adds a few lords I've never even seen in 30+ hours of play, a few spells I've never bothered to cast, and a dragon mage hero that doubles as a capital -- the latter being the only one I'd recommend buying separately for a couple of bucks.  The other extras are a bunch of out-of-game materials most people won't listen to/read.\n\nEdited: And now in the recent patch they've added an in-game store selling things like the privilege of starting on a certain plane/shard for $3.  Warlock 1's Armageddon DLC cost the same and added a new mode.  The Elf DLC added a new race for the same price.  Paradox is definitely on the decline with all these cash grabs.","May 12, 2014","false","129.8"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","15","24","0","0"

Nothing was fixed, not even with the Nagas DLC. The game will occasionally crash while trying to exit or play. Sometimes the mods work and sometimes they don't and will crash the game.\n\nThere are pop-up menus on top of pop-up menus on top of popup menus. WTF!\n\nI often found myself moving the wrong unit to the wrong spot. When the game goes to next unit available, it'll center on a unit but it's not the unit selected, this happens often, so you have to make sure it's the unit that you're giving orders to (or leveling). Also you have to reissue all your orders if a unit moves onto a spot where other units have assigned orders to move to, over and over and over. The game will also at turn's end, ask orders for movement from units that have no movement left, unless they're on sentry.\n\nIn campaign mode, I've lost lots of hours because of poor world seeding. Example: the second world I go to, the gate is on an sky island and I have no flying units, so therefore I can't explore it or settle it. At this point I just have to start a new game since I can't progress any further and hitting enter until I research any kind of flying spell is completely idiotic.\n\nI also find it annoying that I can't reorganize my spell book the way I want it, so my most used spells are at the front, instead you're left with constantly flipping pages to find the spell you need, since spells are auto sorted by alpha order (always defaulted). You can sort them by mana cost or time, but the next time you go cast a spell, it's back to alpha order. I've also noticed that sometimes a spell will disappear and then next turn reappear in your spell book. "Oh! you wanted to heal that unit, too bad, the healing spell is not there this turn" WTF!\n\nSometimes you click on a spot to move or attack, and nothing happens. So you have to click over and cver until the unit does what you want it to do.\n\nThis game is fun but it friggen ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off due to all the BUGS the devs never bothered to fix.\n\nI found thru experimentation that certain mods will crash your game to desktop with an error, if you even get an error that is. Any mod that changes mage improvements, shrines, temples or adds spells that are not normally found in the game will crash it. Which is stupid, since the editor allows you to change these.\n\nSome spells simply don't work. Like meta-teleport, you're supposed to be able to teleport your units between worlds, but you can only teleport them on the same world. Or Clean Lands, it doesn't work half the time on the Dremer world, but it sure uses the mana.\n\nSeems to me the Naga expansion wasn't really well thought out, just sorta thrown in for a cash grab. No monster lairs spawn in the water. Every Naga city you make creates water spaces around that city. The AI players don't quite know how to handle this. They never research terramorphing spells. So they send out their units in ships to be easily sunk.\n\nAfter a lot of playing, I come to find out the AI is a very terrible opponent. I just always declare war on them.\n\nIf you change the game to unlimited cities, the AI does not follow this rule and will only create 3 - 5 cities. So it comes down to your 20+ cities vs their 3 cities. I'm also finding that unhappiness doesn't do anything. I've had max unhappiness and it didn't affect me one bit.\n\nI like the game and I like playing it. But it's so easy to get frustrated from all the bugs in it. I really wish I could give this game a neutral review.\n\nIf you liked Master of Magic, you might like this game (same game pretty much, different graphics), but watch out for the barrage of constant bugs from a game that's been abandoned will never be fixed.\n\nI heavily debated what rating to give it.  It has good and bad point. But I like it, so i guess the good outweight the bad.","March 27, 2015","true","152.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

At first it seems really neat to play a civilization styled game with fantasy elements such as having hero units with great power, gearing them with artifact gear, and even casting spells as a great mage. However, as a game progresses there are a few definite faults. The most prominent of such is having an "optimum city limit". A mage can start out with a max of 5 cities (7 with perk) to be able to occupy and retain good benefits. Unfortunately as the game progresses many cities are captured and not nearly as productive. In one of my games i have about 22 cities and only 8 or so optimal max. Now a solution could be just to raze everything and then use a settler to place a stronghold on said area for defense against ever occuring moster spawns, it is at the same time somewhat redundant since in order to defend against these attacks, one needs troops. The other main annoyance is having only 6 available opponents. I always play in the biggest setting possible, so when i chose a huge game universe and could only face 6 other mages i was dissapointed. Part of what makes these games fun is forming alliances in order to conquer enemies, but I was able to obliterate my opponents before even making contact with the others. In summation i would say its worth maybe 20$ and as for the great mage pack, the contents arent nearly as neat as it may sound. Considering that 3 of the 7 perks are lords that can be hired in the beggining, but fairly soon through playing the game you cant either use the call of suzerain or just find better lords to hire. Well if you could have more then 4 lords total at once it would be better i suppose, but, you cant.","April 21, 2014","false","14.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Paradox has pulled out all the stops in The Exiled.   If you like 4X turn based strategy games then I highly recommend you check out Warlock 2: the Exiled.   There are a few people that are upset about the pricing of the Lord and Great Mage editions but there is nothing game breaking that you will miss out on if you can only afford the standard edition.  That said personally I love Paradox and I love the Warlock series and was more than happy to support them by purchasing the Great Mage edition.\n\nFor those concerned the Developers have already said that there isn't anything in the Great Mage edition that is going to over power those who play multiplayer with the standard.  This is a concern in the Steam forums but there is no reason to be upset.  If you have the money and want to support Paradox go with the Great Mage edition, however if you don't have the money but want the game pick up the standard and you will still have all the great game play.\n\nThe game runs super smooth and I haven't ran into any bugs or real balance issues yet.\n\nOne other thing that might keep some people from picking up the game is the timing with AoW3 coming out.

A few weeks ago, I managed to pick it up for $3.50 and, at that price it was absolutely worth it. Much of the DLC doesn't really impact the game, and none of it is worth picking up even on sale (no, not even nagas... especially not nagas,) except for possibly the book if that is what you are into. Anyway, this game really felt like Warlock 1 DLC, especially since all of the problems from Warlock 1 are present in this game.

In fact those are where the game shines the most as the plane to plane gameplay is actually quite interesting and some of the random events really shake up the gameplay and can make even raising your army interesting as the conditions of the universe change on you.\n\nThe issue though is that all the problems with the first game rather persist. The game has the same glitches including a crash bug that still goes unfixed from Warlock 1, the same imbalances, an unbalanced mage creation system, poor braindead AI, Overpowered heros, useless ordinary units (with exceptions).\n\nThen there are the problems unique to this game. The planes never feel fully fleshed out with their own resources, the races barely take advantage of the planes, the quest system will constantly bar you from progress and ask you to either defeat an excessively tough enemy that can span you hundreds of turns to defeat or require you to pony up resources obscene to collect. Then there are some planes that are neigh on impossible to explore. As well while the events are quite interesting a lot of them only serve to harass you, don't be surprised if the game just decides a volcano would look rather nice next to your capital.\n\nFinally these features don't mesh well with eachother, for example the mage creation system doesn't take into account the new research tree.\n\nUltimately this is a stand alone expansion of Warlock 1. Which would be fine but they just didn't care to put the time and attention that this game needed to shine. It needed to be balanced better, with more features to fill out those planes, A good AI, As well as an overhaul to the random events and quests. In spite of all the effort they clearly put into this game, it still somehow feels like a cheap cash in.","April 14, 2014","false","7.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The AI could certainly do with some improvements, but they're somewhat tough at high difficulty.  However, as a player of the original Warlock, I can't help but notice that this is almost the same game with a new campaign, a couple of new races, and some stragegy tweaks.  Would be better suited to be called a standalone expansion rather than a sequel.  So it is up to you if you think the price is worth it,\n\nThe good:\n- Plenty of room for strategic mastery.  An example is: which cities to have included in the main cities (the one with the gold and iron resources, or the one with 2 pigs and a donkey? Or do I just keep both and just deal with the riots that arise?)\n- Somewhat interesting storyline with some good challenges that hit you throughout the campaign\n- "Just one more turn..." addictiveness that I haven't seen since Civ 3.  You always seem to be on the brink of achieving something.\n\nThe bad:\n- Looooong drawn out campaign.  By the time I had reached Ardania, I was already sick and tired of the grinding.  And that was only on Medium size.  It needs a bit more depth to keep things interesting.\n- Predictable AI.  Oh, you're amassing your troops near my city?  You must be declaring war in 3 turns.\n\nThe other:\n- "Campaign" option in the menu (currently empty, but being pre-sale I can't complain, but I'm hopeful this will give some good replayability to the game)\n- Spawns, spawns, and more spawns.  Just when you think you're done with those giants, the game decides to spawn 2 red dragon nests on the other side of the map so you basically lose the city before your troops can cross.  Good income, but very tedious after a while.  Also - why do so damn many of the spawns fly?

I was hoping to get a tast of old-school Master of Mgic, and this was a temporary fix. It's different enough from Civ to be fun and refreshing, but the game mechanics made it tedious in mid to late game.\n\nPros:\n- Challenging - The wrong move could easily cost you a veteran hero. You learn to wander off into new worlds only with expendible troops, etc. You will lose troops. You will lose cities. The rise and fall is exciting.\n- Different - Tile types and heros were different - you can build mana farms instead of farms. Perks provided by certain improvements were really interesting and fun.\n- Variety - The tech trees for different civilizations were well-thought out and different enough to force you into a different strategy for each.\n\nCons:\n- Very few options with excess mana. Can't increase your casting power, so you just accumulate excess mana if your economy is mana-focused. It's frustrating.\n- Excess food means NOTHING. You have a minimum food for population and troops eat (a little) food, but towns increase in size at a fixed rate, so unless your people are starving, there's no benefit to extra food. Yes, excess is converted to cash, but if I needed cash, I'd build cash buildings.\n- The economy revolves around money. There's a cap on how much mana you can realistically spend, and excess food is converted to cash, so you quickly learn that building cash is the only really valuable resource. This removes a lot of strategy and the benefits of any variety in the different races.\n- Random events are devasating and often change the landscape, affecting the bonuses of carefully placed town improvements. They sometimes take out town population, which might have taken 30 turns to increase by 1 (at a fixed rate), leaving your economy in shambles with no way to recover for another 30+ turns: enough to cost you the game.\n\nThis game seemed promising, but in the end was just annoying.

Most maps are nothing but bottleneck tactics. Terrain changes faster than it can be used. Monsters that spawn have a stupidly high chance of being stronger than all players combined. I've had a "Nightmare" monster completely dominate an entire land to a point where I will be remaking the game AGAIN.\n\nThe first warlock is way better but has some of the same issues, however this game is just bottle-neck nightmares. Stupidly imbalanced terrain, stupidly imbalanced monsters and quests that give good rewards but takes a single event to set you back 20 turns. I'm only playing on normal and me and all the bots are getting annihilated. It is unwise to even bother leaving the starting land because as soon as you do, your home is invaded by stupidly strong monsters that will kill all of your units if you leave them there.\n\nI'm glad I waited for this game to be on sale, because it's not worth buying in its current state.

I like that the different campaigns are very different.  You can play a conquer your neighbors game like any other, on either a series of worlds or on a large world with the other worlds attached as possible, though not necessary places to explore; or you can compete to be the first to finish a series of increasingly difficult quests in what maybe shouldn't be the default game mode;  or if you have the expansion you can play against a single strong opponent who appears in the middle of your civilization, nagas this time rather than dremers as in the first game.  I like that this final mode encourages you to work together with your opponents whether they are computer players or human players, and I like that computer allies really will help you.  This is something very lacking in really all the other 4X games, where it is just a fight for supremacy.\n\nThe other thing that sets this game appart is the focus on tactical combat and exploration rather than civilization building or roleplaying (as in the Age of Wonders or HOMM series).  I like this. You start off right away with an army and your army grows just as much as you want it to, as you can build units at the same time as buildings in your cities.  (a bizarre restriction in the Civ games and in the Endless games)  There are so many different types of neutral units that hide great rewards in their spawn points.  Much of the early game is just plain survival, and it's a lot of fun.  It never seems like you've explored everything.  Even after 100s of hours that I've spent in both Warlock 1 and 2 combined.  In multiplayer turns are turn-based rather than simultaneous, but as everything happens on the main map, and you can watch your allies, things don't seem as boring as HOMM (which I would never play multiplayer).\n\nI really am liking Endless Space and Endless Legend as well, those really have a lot to discover, but this has a pick up and play quality and a, I must play just a few more turns, quality that keeps me playing this even when those are available.  I suppose I would play those when I want something more serious, and this when I want something fun, while the old standards of Civ and HOMM are really starting to feel more OLD than standard in their current iterations.","January 18, 2015","true","85.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Same but with a couple new races, land tiles and ways to play through the game. If however you are new to the series then its your typical hex-based strategy game with magic. You're a big lord  with an army and your job is beat up all the other big lords. Although in this game there is a mode where you are a big lord and instead of beating up the other big lords you join your forces and just a few worlds away is an utterly massive lord for you to beat up. You could also beat up all the big lords then the massive lord too if that's what you'd like. The game does have a few flaws though. The ai is a bit dumb and the world you start  out on a bit small. Also there is a limit to how many towns you can build before you start to run into problems. This presumably was introduced to counteract the always useful plan in the first game of building as many towns as possible very quickly and steamrolling the other side but the starting limit is 5 which is defintely too low if you don't get the spells to increase it. Thankfully you can turn towns you capture or build that aren't doing much for you into shrines to a god, forts or freetowns which don't count towards your town limit. All in all I found it a very enjoyable game to while away a few hours especially if you like to listen to podcasts while gaming but have run out of games.

While starting to play it showed up more interesting. Not much unlike in Civilization you build up your empire by cities anyhow it's more cutted off the micromanagement. You could clearly concentrate on building up your army out of different races-buildtree. Besides you are a Wizard and could research spells to upgrade your economy, power or arms. All in all it shows up with kind of long-term-motivation to do one-more-turn. Those splitted grounds offer different enviroments and options for different settlement. Game is focused on warfare and tactical combat, but you could reach your goals by (limited) diplomacy too. Only thing I do not like is, the current Overlord is spreading spells to ruin landscapes so the more power you gain, the more often your cities are harmed by and there is no way to intercept this, except to kill the Overlord in endgame. Yeah, you could repair landscape with your own spells...but it shouldn't be the main duty every other turn in my eyes.\nIf you could find game on sale...grab it, as it is a nice alternative roundbased fantasy game.","March 26, 2015","true","59.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

If you've played the orginal then you will know the appeal of the a game which combines the best of Civilization with elements from the 90s "Master of Magic" and Stardock's more recent Fallen Enchantress. The  Warlock series is steeped in Ardanian lore from games such as the Majesty collection and so has quite a bit of inspiration to draw from. And this, sadly is where Warlock 2 falls short. It is little more than a carbon copy of the orginal with a few changes to the mechanics, some additional units, races and spells. As some have already posted it's more like a combo DLC than a stand alone game. Paradox could have done so much more by expanding gameplay, improving diplomacy and building on the mid and late game events introduced in the Armageddon expansion from the first Warlock game. It is clear that the game engine is the same as the original however.\n\nThe game is also buggy even as of the latest patch with, in my experiance at least, constant crashes, freezes and stalled AI turns. The AI, is also somewhat flawed and does not give the level of challenge in later stages of the game that you would want. By around turn 80 you know who is going to win. Your greatest challenge mostly comes from the monster lairs and the occasional random event.\n\nSo should you pay for this?  Well it depends. If you like the Civ-type game with magical elements then yes you probably will find it interesting for a while and you will get a moderate amount of replayability. If you are a fan of the orginal and are looking for some modest evolutionary changes, then again you will continue to enjoy the franchise. If you, like myself, are looking for the next step in magic based strategy games with lots of intricate gameplay, deep diplomacy and challenging AI then you will be disappointed.\n\nFor those who do play I would strongly recommend the Renaissance Mod from Chumley - it's practically a DLC in its own right. You can find it here:  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=493257789&searchtext=\n\nIt's easy to tell if a developer puts care, ethusiasm and energy into a release and when they just phone it in for the sake of a few dollars. I never recommend paying full price for games which fall into the later category and unfortunately Paradox on this occasion are well and truely in this space. There is only one sure fire way to make developers take notice and thats through poor sales. At the time of this review, the game is several years old. I would suspect that you can pick it up on sale or relatively cheaply.\n\n","March 14","false","323.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a lot of difference from Warlock 1 which is why you see a lot of negative reviews because a lot of people expected more considering its been a long time since the first Warlock game and the DLCs aren't value for money, they cost a lot but don't really add a lot to the game. Good news is, there is this amazing fan who made a patch that adds way more content (2 entire races, lots of perks, abilities, upgrades) and fixes some of the broken parts of the game (Dragon faction too weak etc) so it becomes a much better game overall.\n\nPros:\n1. More combat and magic spell oriented Civ 5, don't expect diplomatic or economic victories here\n2. Lots of spells and differentiation between races and Lords, unlike say Civ 5 where you have unique unit and thats it\n3. Rennaisance mod makes it value for money*\n\nCons:\n1. Expensive - Unless you buy it on sale you need to pay a lot for expensive DLCs which add little to the game, to play the Rennaisance mod requires you to buy every single playable DLC in the game\n2. Without the R Mod you are basically getting a repackaged Warlock 1 game, might be better to just buy Warlock 1 and all its DLC since that would be cheaper and you essentially get the same experience\n\nTLDR: If money is a concern then just buy on sale or better yet buy Warlock 1.

Essentially Warlock 2 is Civilization V with a fantasy twist, and the twist makes all the difference. Never enjoyed Civ 5, but I am liking Warlock a lot. Warlock 2 does a great job at making you feel like a badass mage, packing some powerful spells like the ability to warp the landscape and erect a volcano, or call in a lightning storm, and grant your troops the ability of flight. There's also a fun quest system, and NPC mages that will harass you until you complete certain quests.\n\nIf you never played the first one, then this is a great game to pick up. Most of the negative reviews come from people who felt Warlock 2 didn't add enough to Warlock 1 to justify the "2," but it's nevertheless a good game.\n\nContrasting to AoW3, then I find that AoW3 does everything better than Warlock. More customization, more detailed battles, more maps, two length single player campaigns (Warlock has none), and a better selection of avatars. However, you might still prefer Warlock over AoW because Warlock is more streamlined for quicker turns and games. It's probably, therefore, a better choice for multiplayer, unless you want long drawn out games amongst close friends with AoW3. All in all, if you're an impatient player, you might prefer Warlock, but either way you can't go wrong.","October 7, 2014","true","17.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

My one complaint might be that heavy upkeep costs push you in the direction of large, heavy hitting units and heros over swarms of smaller creatures and this removes a lot of the flavor from the game because you don't get all that much value from your rank and file army creatures vs the non-race-specific heros.

A very good fantasy CIV-like game. The other good one is Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes, but although the games cover same niche, they are drastically different from each other.\n\nIn here most things are similiar to CIV5, besides maybe magic system. Also units level ups and upgrades seem more important here.

Despite being speed up, enemy turns take long (many weak units) and I decided on war with them even if they want to ally, just so I don't have to watch all their units move.\n\nThe shard-like lands, which are connected with gates seem to contain the above problem a little bit (the idea of shards with teleporters itself is ripped of from Allods/Rage of Mages :P). This makes it easier to for the player to just block off the enemy waves and slowly rip them apart.\n\nThe addition of (heavily overpriced?)

IMO this game mode is fail since you have no choice but to fester for hundreds of turns (my 2 tries were 200 and 400 turns respectively both failed ) first try i had 20 units in my main army all dead in 3-4 turns , second try was 50ish units about 10-12 turns until i realized i had failed to bring enough units. most of the units i used in both attempts were upgraded elite units , regular units could not even fight through to final zone.\nThe sandbox version of game however is very fun and not nearly as frustrating , however it is just a more polished version of first game, and i did not see some of the resources found in exiled version ( only 2 games yet ) hope they are there to enjoy.\nAlso found many bugs in the game , like the fog of war is not always active , some games have it some don't. sometimes random units just disappear from game for no reason. when ressurecting units that had buffs from structures you can go negative on those counts as unit comes back with them on wwhen you could have placed on new unit. when paging through units you cannot center on unit , same for castles with enemy at gates , forcing you to manually search for correct castle to use the defenses. over all fun game but needs quite a bit of work to be worth the price","March 23, 2014","true","178.3"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

A very good fantasy CIV-like game. The other good one is Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes, but although the games cover same niche, they are drastically different from each other.\n\nIn here most things are similiar to CIV5, besides maybe magic system. Also units level ups and upgrades seem more important here. Beyond that, it is all about building more and more towns, units and reasearch (which kind of limits the growth here, unlike Warlock 1).\n\nIt is pleasing to expand using specialized cities, gain resources and improve your several units, but it is tedious even on medium maps and with just 2 enemies, when they start to spam units and towns on every possible hex of land. Despite being speed up, enemy turns take long (many weak units) and I decided on war with them even if they want to ally, just so I don't have to watch all their units move.\n\nThe shard-like lands, which are connected with gates seem to contain the above problem a little bit (the idea of shards with teleporters itself is ripped of from Allods/Rage of Mages :P). This makes it easier to for the player to just block off the enemy waves and slowly rip them apart.\n\nThe addition of (heavily overpriced?) Lords that you can recruit adds a bit to the game as well.\n\nAlthough the game is a definite improvement and it really plays nice, sometimes it just feels like a big (but not huge) DLC to the core game.\n\nIs it worth it?\nDepends:\n\nIf you never played any Warlock games but like strategy games and fantasy settings: YES!\n\nIf you loved Warlock 1 game and are in love with it: YES!\n\nIf you tried Warlock 1 and did not like it too much: NO!\n(since it is mainly the same game)","March 28, 2014","true","4.2"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Please forgive me if the review is mostly a historical account of the DLC problems: I just want to record them here.\n\nThe state of the game right now though is fine; I recommend it and look forward to a possible Warlock 3 one day.\n\nMistakes:\n\n1. The first DLC mistake was having a Great Mage edition with 7 extra pieces of game content but they made it an upgrade from the collector's edition with ebook and soundtrack type stuff, so you were forced to pay far, far too much for the GM edition in order to get the 7 extra content pieces for the game because the GM edition was an edition up from the collector.\n\nPeople complained so they took action to make it so you could buy the DLC from GM edition on its own.\n\n2. Unfortunately they did this by 2 weeks after launch, adding an in-game store, putting the great mage DLC in it at high prices for what it was, and also adding other content pieces that were only available in the in-game store with steam wallet and so were never featured in steam sales and no-one looking at the store page on steam could see them. The in-game store wasn't even mentioned on the store page.\n\nAfter myself and others complained for months about it not mentioning the in-game store on the steam store page they changed it so it did. After more complaining they about the existence of the in-game store itself they took action again:\n\n3. They removed the in-game store (yay) but provided no other way to buy the content.\n\nEventually they took action again.\n\n4. They removed GM edition and made the DLC available as DLCs on steam (yay) but charged way, way too much for each pack of very small things, also they didn't have some of the content available (starting areas aka "world pack"). In addition there was some confusion because the Thrilling Trio DLC which was included in GM edition was not showing as owned for people who had previously bought the GM edition.\n\n5. The fifth DLC mistake was taking far too long to put the DLC packs in a sale. For example only one of the DLC got any discount in the big Holiday sale at Christmas 2014, which is the ideal time for a reduction. It really looked like there were no staff in charge of doing anything to do with this game, even putting it in sales.\n\n6. The final DLC mistake was not putting the World Pack DLC out at all. It was supposed to be the last collection of DLC from the in-game store. It looked as if the game had been abandoned. Months passed and there was no way to buy the World Pack DLC.\n\nFinally though, they came through and gave the World Pack DLC free to everyone, removing the last problem and finally putting the game in a good place.\n\n------\n\n\n\nActual review:\n\nIf you like 4x games it's quite fun and there's no shame in buying it in a sale. The AI is not the best though, so if you are good at 4x games you may become frustrated by it.","April 10, 2014","true","7.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

I can`t deny I am frustrated by some of the changes they made to this sequel. My biggest complaint goes to the addition of city unrest, which could be an attempt to add some more strategy depth by slowing down the conquest pace and forcing you to balance city specialization. You are now limited to a set number of cities until you research spells that increase the cap or transform conquered cities in Fortresses or Free Towns, which don`t add up to the limit, but also prevent you from constructing buildings and units. In my oppinion, this is a huge step back, for one of the features I liked most in Warlock was its total focus on war. No meddling with happiness or similar things. Conquer the nearest city and go on to the next. If I wanted a Civ-like game, I'd play Civ V.\n\nThe graphics didn't change much, although you can perceive some minor improvements. There are new units, spells and a campaign mode that gives you  chance to play the game in a different scenario-based way.\n\nAll in all, Warlock 2 is a good game, bringing you more of the same you love, but fans of the original might not like the change in pace. If you are new to the series and want a fast and furious game, focusing on battles with fantasy units and monsters, try Warlock: Master of the Arcane first. If you've played the first and is looking for the same gameplay experience, think again if you can cope with the lash on your warmongering appetite.","March 24, 2014","true","19.2"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

It may work fine for some people, but for many, myself included, it's broken.\n\nFirst of all, the things I liked about the gameA simplified version of Civilizations. Not overly complicated but still fun.\nThe combat takes place on the world map.\nA large variaty of attack, defense, buff, and debuff spells.\nYour units and heroes level up, become stronger, and gain new buffs.\nWith the right hero, the right perks, upgrades, artifacts and buffs, you can make a really unstopable force.Simply put, if you like turn-based strategy games, you will like this one. It adds a few new things and does a few things differently.\n\nNow the important part, why this game is badThe game is no longer supported. Found a buy? Having problems? ...nobody is going to fix it.\nThe game is unfinished. Exactly like the first game, it was left in a buggy and unoptimised state.\nIf you are using Windows10, a Mac, or Linux, the game has an even higher chance of not working for you.\nGame freezes your PC or at least crashes if you are lucky.\nAs much as I enjoyed the game, I did not enjoy having t force-shutdown my new and very expensive gamer PC because of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that kept freezing my system. At least half of the time the game was only crashing, which I can live with, but it got to a point where it would keep crashing and I could no longer continue my game.\n\nDon't make the mistake I made and hope that this game might work better for you than it did for everybody else.","October 24, 2015","false","12.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

Literally. It's like they took the first game and added a few new factions, monsters, resources etc. There are even some mistakes in the first game that make it to the new one (it still bugs me that Court Werewolves' acid explosion does Elemental Damage when the decription says Spirit Damage). So really, this game feels like a hefty expansion pack rather than a whole new title.\nThe new races are neat, but I feel that they don't "fit" as well as the old triumverate of Human, Monster, Undead. Svarts seem like humans with a higher-tech focus; really, I don't know why they didn't go with dwarves instead, since they seem just like the classic representation. Some aspects of the Svart tech tree seem distinctly out of place for a fantasy game, such as the hovering pods with what I swear are laser rifles. Planeswalkers have a nifty mix of unit origins and thus a lot of options, but seem to suffer more than they benefit from their diversity; They lack second-tier healers and their magic casters are pretty weak. They have an excellent selection of Elite units from Temples, but those are obviously very challenging to get with a sub-standard army. The Alrethi elves just seem to do everything better than the other races. Ostensibly this is offset by their more costly units, but it feels a bit unbalanced to me.\nIf you were hoping for new units and buildings for the old races, you're out of luck. The new races are it. And any new buildings come from new resources.\nHOWEVER, one of the most absurd and annoying changes from the first game involves resources and unit perks. Units no longer automatically gain applicable perks from the cities where they're built (such as drilled, fine armor, etc). This is a poor change, as it eliminates some degree of planning if you're not trying to cram as many upgrade buildings as possible around your unit-producing cities. What's absurd, however, is that the uses of these perks are now limited in number; five is the most common, but some resources offer even fewer. While this arguably makes sense in the case of physical resources like iron or adamantium, why the blazes should a barracks only be able to give five units the "drilled" perk? Do they run out of instructors or something? And what are we supposed to do with a building after it's dispensed all its upgrades? Demolish it, I suppose. Anyway, the first thing I did with the Mod system included in the game is set all the resources much higher, but that was a distinctly irritating change to the gameplay.\nThe other changes to the general gameplay would be the city limit and unrest meter. The unrest meter was never a problem for me; if it's not hard to manage, then it's not a problem. The city limit (and the prospect of "Special Cities") was intriguing, but after trying it out I turned it off for future games. I like my big armies, thanks, and you just can't do that with tightly limited upgrade resources and a handful of cities to make and support your units.","September 14, 2014","true","210.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

IMO, whichever side of the fence you are on.. its a subjective opinion... and honestly, if you feel that way, i totally get it.\n\nhere's how i look at it though..\n\none:  you are paying the same price you would for most stand alone expansions.\n\nfor $30 you get the standard edition, and you get everything you need minus the bonus content, which is bonus content if you want it.  i dont consider anything in the Great Mage edition a must have.\n\nthus, you are essentially getting the full game for $30.  the price seems pretty reasonable to me - even if we are saying this is just an expansion.\n\ntwo - Exiled Mode:\n\nfirst, its unique.  instead of one large map where you go out adventuring, collecting stuff, building your empire, conquering other civilizations,  all on a single plane..  you have a ton of smaller maps which you access by opening portals.. each with their own unique flavor to them, and you STILL have the adventuring, loot finding, conquering, etc.\n\nand what makes things even more unique is that each of the maps have a different element effect.  one will be undead, one will be lava lands, one will be winter/frost based, etc.\n\nive started a few games and i can say from experience that you dont start on the same environment every time so you have to modify your strategy a little each time you play.. there are some scripted moments that dont change.. but beyond that you can have a different experience each time you play the game.\n\nthe above mode, along with all the improvements like tech/spell trees, etc is enough for me to recommend Warlock II.\n\na few criticisms:\n\nthe units seem kind of useless for the most part.  you have many summoning spells available to you, and what you get can be quite powerful.  especially the dragons and spirit wolves.  also, you will get 4 heroes as you progress through exiled mode which can also become quite deadly.  you use those 4 heroes, a high level summoned dragon and maybe a unit or two for good measure and you are pretty much set.  yes, you need to defend your cities as you play.. but honestly, once you reach the optimal city limit, which you can usually manage on two continents.. the cities can become expendable.\n\nalso, sometimes the random monster encounters you get can become frustrating.  they always seem to happen right around the time you are fighting a rival great mage.  some may consider this a positive.  myself, i just find it tedious.\n\none final minor criticism.. the diplomacy mechanic.  there really isnt one.  lets say you declare a seize fire on a rival so you can clear out some monsters.  its almost a guarantee that the AI will attack again real soon, sometimes even on the very next turn.  basically diplomacy comes down to  accepting the seize fire to get a spell, gold, and mana and thats about it.\n\nconclusion:\n\nIMO, the amount of content in the game is enough to consider it worth the price - whether you consider it an expansion or not.. ask yourself, in the end, is it worth $30.  me.  i say DEFINITELY.\n\n","April 14, 2014","true","29.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Did you ever want something that was a less involved in juggling the requirements of building a long term successful civilization and at the same time gave you the feeling of building an expanding empire?  Oh, and did you ever ponder what Civilization 5 would be like if it didn't take itself so serious?  Well, that pretty much sums up Warlock 2.  The comparison is unavoidable between the two since much of the interface is similar.  Much of what you do in the game will be familiar to Civ 5 players, just less involved and deep in its potential.  Diplomacy - check.  City building and development - check. Resource management - check.  Build troops to decimate the enemy - check.  Now, with all that said, the one area where Warlock 2 is possibly ahead of Civ 5 is the actual combat game.  Between the variety of combat types, upgrades, and magic types vs melee and ranged troops Warlock 5 shows itself to be more designed to be a pure combat empire builder than Civ 5.  Sure there are other types of victory conditions, but in the end most will play to dominate the enemy on the field of battle since the other types of victory are not nearly as deep and satisfying.  At times there is even an RPG component to Warlock 2 that some may find appealing.  The joy in Warlock is that it presents a fun and playable game that doesn't take itself too serious and at times even manages to laugh at itself.  For those that prefer there is a campaign game that unfold a story along with a more scripted gameplay, but for myself it is best as a sandbox where you can dapple in all the absurdity of a fantasy world inhabited with giant rats, vampires, and creatures normally found in mythology.","April 15, 2014","true","9.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

But it is priced as an expansion, unless you plan on getting the great mage edition. It adds what amounts to a campaign mode, retools the spell research system, adds 2 new races, and includes a race that was DLC for the first game. If you never played the first warlock, but are interested in the series, get this one. If you do have the first game, then whether you get this is entirely dependant on how much you liked the original. If you did like it, well, this is more of the same, and some solid additions. For $30 I can certainly recommend it, but I can only recommend getting the great mage edition if you have money to burn, or really REALLY like the series. If you DIDN'T like Warlock: Master of the Arcane, and were hoping that the sequel would fix everything you hated, well, then this probably isn't the game for you, because all they really fixed was the research system.","April 17, 2014","true","25.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Having logged inumerabe hours in Civilization, the granddaddy of turn based strategy games, I actualy tjhink I prefer Warlock. Perhaps it is because the units in Warlock have more personality, thus I feel more emotionally invested in them.\nA couple things  that I love about Warlock...\n1. The controls are silky smooth and emipire management is simple and easy to deal wiith compared to any other TBS game I think of. Each turn icons representing different types of actions cascade down the right side of your screen- at least that is what they did in Master of the Arcane. In Warlolck 2 you have to expand a single action button to see the colulmn of icons- I prefer the icons in the previous game. In any event, management of your cities and units is quick and efficient- you are prompted to make decisions so there is no reason you will forget something important, allowing  to concentrate on strategy. Battles are on the campaign hex map and not on a separate battle screen.\n2. The random map generator does a great job of changing things up. As in CIV you set the parameters, and the random geography created will have a huge impact on gameplay. Thus each camapign feels unique and replayability is thru the roof.\n\nComparing Warlork 2 to Warlock Master of the Arcane, they are virtually the same game with a couple races added, some new rules and options. They also added a spell tech tree which is an improvement. Master of the Arcane DLC was inexpensive and greatly enhanced the Warlock experience- the Dremor DLC was mind blowingly challenging, but I was up for the challenge- so I will expect the same from Warlock 2. Yes! Warlock 2 is worth the $30 price tag. How could I think not since it is one of my favorite games ever?\n\n","May 4, 2014","true","117.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

PLease keep in mind it is a LITE stratagy game.\nBest thing about it are the diverse factions. Units of factions play very differently (Unlike AOW3 races).\nSpells are Ok. Overall most are really basic spells that you expect in this type of game/\nThe gods system is cool. This is where may of the more interesting spells can be found.\nHeros... Overall they are a diverse group with some cool powers. Their backstories are lame though. WIth it would be more like FE: Heros backstories.\n\nThe biggest negetive in the game is:\nWorst are the CRASHES. At this point I would hope they happen less often. It is not in Early Access anymore.\nThe 2-3 crashes per hour of game time are a Major pain.\nPeople complain about the AI being too easy.... Dont get the game if you are some uber hardcore player and expect the AI to be hard at all. This is nothing new to the game type.\n\nGet the game if you dont mind risking the crashing and troubleshooting.\nOtherwise, wait a bit for the bugs to be squashed.\n\nEdit: Looks like most of the bugs are worked out on my 2 PCs. So overall its a nice game espc if you get it on sale. AI still needs a bit of work, but looking at the last game made (I dont have Warlock I) I would not hold my breath for that.\nSo I will say it's a buy now. I won't be getting the DLC till something better comes out.","May 9, 2014","true","89.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

Not enough has changed from the first game. Although there are a couple of new races, they mostly have the same units as the existing races. The new "Exile" mode was the reason I bought this game, but it is a disappointment. I won several games of the basic single map scenario at the hard difficulty level. I tried the Exile mode at the Normal difficulty. I got about two thirds of the way through the Exile campaign without any difficulties and then I encountered a world that was incredibly tough. Despite maxing out the level of my heroes, they got wiped out almost immediately. I won the Exile mode, but only by defeating the other four mages, not by retaking my home world.","September 2, 2014","true","46.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

In my opinion, it plays faster than Civ at the expense of some depth, but makes up for that depth with rich, large worlds and a wide range of gameplay options on the combat level.\n\nIf you have played Warlock before, then Warlock 2 is pretty much exactly what you want in a sequel.  The Exile campaign mode sets players on exterior shards in a labyrinthine web of interesting miniature worlds to fight your way to the central hub world and beat the AI-controlled boss for control - which is interesting and compelling, if surprisingly difficult.  The new worlds add a wide variety of resources, monsters, and terrain to the game, which was not lacking in the first game but is a welcome addition.  Furthermore, the number of playable races has practically doubled, offering a great deal of replay value and a ton of new options for tech trees and internal management as you expand your empire to include a wider variety of creatures and troops.\n\nOn the downside, the game discourages vast empires with a city limit - which does prevent turns from going too long - but that option can be turned off on the menu.  Resources for creature upgrades are now limited to a set number of uses per resource, but that works as an incentive to do more exploration and expansion.  On the truly minor gripe level, the achievements are a bit glitchy at time of writing, but I suspect they'll be repaired in due time.\n\nIn short, Warlock 2 is a solid improvement on the already-solid Warlock formula.  If you're a Warlock fan, you should absolutely make the investment; if you're a Civilizations fan or a strategy fan, you should definitely try it out.","May 7, 2014","true","72.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/205990/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","Warlock II: The Exiled is the kind of game that I should have written a review for a while ago, but because of the size of the game, and the VERY slow pace the game takes, I am now finally able to write up a review. First off this is a fantasy turn based adventure game where you are going to play the part of a powerful warlock who saved all the realms, but in his absence from the main realm became exiled. You will now have to gather troops, heroes, knowledge, and more if you are going to be able to retake what is rightfully your's. There will be many portals you will have to transverse, but if you can make it out to the other side you might just find your chance to exact your revenge.\n\nGraphically this game is not going to blow you away, but at the same time it looks well done. I do like the concept that every realm is a floating island, and that there is a wide variety of lands that you will have to deal with. You might be dealing with snowy lands, deserts, lava, cursed lands, and water. You never know what the next world will bring. There's also a very wide variety of enemies to face off against, you will get the chance to battle sea serpents, minotaurs, elementals, dragons, bats, and more. The one thing that I wish had a little bit more TLC to it was the city screens. I understand that there was definitely a minimal approach to it, but it doesn't feel as polished.\n\nThe music does a great job of blending into the game to the point that you don't really notice it after a while.\n\nThe controls are pretty straight forward, you are going to be using the mouse almost exclusively, with the exception of WASD when you are playing on dual monitors. If you don't you will notice that you are constantly clicking out of the game when trying to scroll across the map.\n\nEven though there is a story to follow, most of the game is randomly generated and is customized to the experience you want to have. You can choose the size of the land masses, the number of warlocks you will have to deal with, and of course the difficulty. Now I will say this, no matter what you are going to have to deal with micro-managing of resources until you can't take it any more. This game hinges on the fact that it plods along slowly so if there were issues you wouldn't see them. There's also a large amount of randomly generated neutral enemies that will pop back up after a while to keep you on your toes in areas that you have removed all your troops from. Speaking of troops, it is damn near impossible to be able to successfully sustain more than a handful of troops. The cost of gold, food, and mana per turn for each unit, hero, building, it will drive you made. There were only a very few times in the game where I was actually gaining on all 3 and that was when I didn't do anything on those turns. The one thing that did completely drive me up the wall was the fact that you have a limited amount of towns that you are allowed to have, and out of those you can only change the ones that you personally settled to specialty towns to help with your micro-managing and decrease your town count. Here's the problem, I'm a conquerer, I never built a second town, I've capture all the cities I've found, and yet I get penalized for it.\n\nAt the end of the day the thing about this game that you are going to NEED to have is the editor. This is probably one of the best and most in-depth editors I've seen in a long time. You can build an entire game out of it utilizing Warlock II as a backbone. If you are willing to put in the time you can EASILY make something light years better than what comes out of the box. So with that I have to give a grade on the game, as is, and not what the game can potentially have with user contributions. This game gets a 6.5 out of 10.","June 1, 2014","true","12.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

So similar that my review of the first game applies to this game almost perfectly. I might be annoyed for paying for this one if I didn't get the first one for free. More like Warlock 1.5 with all the DLC. Paradox's nickel and dime DLC strategy is little annoying, but at least they are often on sale. Nevertheless it's a good 4X game that reminds me of Master of Magic in a good way.\n\nThis sequel elaborates on the multiple worlds mechanic and adds a new game mode where you need to fight your way through the mini-worlds to the main one and defeat the big bad. I'm not a big fan of elaborate quests in my 4X, but this one is OK. I prefer to play the "sandbox" modes, though. Other than that, there is more stuff. More races, more monsters, more spells and so on. The new random events include some text boxes with decisions, but there is still too much random monsters popping up out of nowhere. I recommend reducing the monster spawning from default or it will be annoyingly grindy and overwhelm the AI.\n\nOverall, it's a nice fantasy 4X game that triggers the "one more turn" obsession in me. Get it if you like this kind of turn based strategy. If you already have Warlock 1, or are on Mac or Linux, you might want to think about it. I have heard complaints that it's very buggy on those. Only moderately buggy on Windows.","January 26, 2015","true","51.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While this game has many qualities that I like, there are many things about it I do not. I will skip the nonsense and go straight to the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n*There are many game settings you can choose from in the sandbox mode, which is great for giving you just the right amount of a challenge.\n*The game has a nice selection of characters to choose from. Each one very customizable, and many different races to choose as a starting city.\n*The variety of units and enemies are very expansive. I never felt like every other race was just a clone of another.\n*The game has a large amount of replayability. The above mentioned items, as well as completely random worlds and situations make each session unique.\n\nCons:\n*For many users, this game encounters random crashes with no warnings or crash screen to explain what happened.\n*The AI is extremely annoying. Almost every single game I play, the opponents constantly bug me for non-aggression pacts and alliances every 2 or 3 turns. I got to one point in a game where I met all 8 of them, and every 2 or 3 turns, all 8 of them asked for an alliance. You almost have to declare war on them just to make them shut up. But then they just ask for peace every few turns. This does not change based on difficulty.\n*It is too easy to steamroll enemies. Honestly the most challenging parts of the game I have found to be exploring the other worlds with extremely hard wild monsters. Even on the max difficulty though, once you build up to it, you can just mow through every faction with little to no resistance. Their combat AI is no better than their diplomacy AI.\n\nOther than that though, the game really has some potential. If someone out there was good with code, and could mod it to have a decent AI, I would recommend this game in a heartbeat. Or if the developer ever desires to finish what could have been an amazing game. As it stands though, I do not recommend it. At least not at full price. Wait for a Steam sale, and if you are dying for some new 4x, give it a shot.","May 14, 2015","false","210.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No pressure, just play.\n\nCons:\n-	Bugs… Did not let me play after turn such and such…\n-	No story line… Sorry, the “story line” is introduced in Warlock 2 (Which is basically Warlock 1 with story line and extra race) - wait I just realized this is Warlock 2... Well, no difference.\n-	Optimization is just awful – game seems not finished.\n-	All the game is like some beta access game not a finished product\n-	Music, was there any music?\n-	Bad graphics\n-	Gets boring really fast… because there is no reason to play it really. Except for multiplayer with is full of glitches as well.\n-       Devs do not give a toss about this game... No support. no bugs fixes\n\nConclusion: That could have been a really nice game but it is just unfinished. It feels like only half of it was made and only half of this half was tested.\n\nMy rating 3.50/10","January 28","false","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/btm109/recommended/205990/","btm109","Brian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/btm109/","386 products in account","Warlock 2 is a confused 4x game which has broken the playfield up into a series of small maps connected via portals which you must cross to defeat the final opponent.  Nearing the portals with a unit triggers random events for activating the portal and other allies of the end boss will create random events of their own to trip you up.\n\nResource management is very strict.  It may be difficult at first to balance your cities so that they are able to grow and remain happy.  The number of cities you are able to control at a time is also kept very low (5-11 as the game progresses).  Although this can be changed with an option in the game settings it is marked 'Not Recommended'.  Developing advanced units can also be challenging as each is produced by a specific building which has other buildings as a pre-requisite and each building must be placed within a limited area in which other structures for wealth and food must also exist.  This forces the player along rather narrow paths which greatly limit the viable choices that can be made.\n\nThis is my main complaint about the game.  It feels too rigid.  The player is locked into a very limited set of choices while forced to face randomly appearing enemies and AI opponents which greatly outmatch you at every step.  This creates gameplay in which there is perhaps only one narrow path to victory and only by discovering that single formula can the player succeed.  This is in opposition to the general appeal of a 4x game which to me is that you can discover many paths to victory.","May 23","false","47.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Anticipating new features, cleanups of quirks, and hopefully expanded content, I purchased and began playing. At first things looked good, however, after getting further into the game I quickly encountered several issues that caused me to throw my hands up and remove the game from my system. To whit:\n\nBuilding buffs (like unit armor, combat training, resistance potions) are now limited to a very small quantity. For example, i was only able to outfit 5 units with basic armor. So once equipting my 4 heroes, I had to pick one lucky unit to get the last set.\n\nRandom monsters that spawn quite a bit more frequently than before (on default setting) now include creature types like shadow dragons, units with 300 hp, immune to a variety of usual attacks, and flying. So much for several of my cities.\n\nAfter building up what seemed like a decent force of heroes, strong (100+ hp melee units) and ranged units (casters and archers), I daintly sent my forces into an outer plane. The horde of shadow dragons, deadwood elementals, gold dragons, and evil warlocks promptly showed me the error of my ways. And this was on the easiest difficulty level.\n\nWhile the gameplay has indeed improved, it feels like the AI was improved by the use of power boosts rather than intelligence. I am not a big fan of 'meatgrinder' type campaigns, especially after the game was modified to restrict me to 5 starting cities (bumpable to 8). I simply could not generate enough quailty units fast enough to replace lost units.\n\nIf you appreciate running a constant stream of units to be killed while trying to achieve your goal, this game could certainly hold your interest. It does not appeal to me in that it pretty much makes the leveling, buffing, and equipting I prefer in building a fighting force completely moot.","May 24","false","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
