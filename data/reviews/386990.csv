There is quite heavy subject matter, if you prefer to avoid that, this VN may not be for you. I've divided this review into two parts - gameplay and story/emotional impact of the game.\n\nThoughts, game-wise:I feel the execution of this game was done quite well. I've tried 3 or 4 different routes so far (there seem to be more to discover) and the way new content is presented as you make different choices flows quite smoothly, in contrast to some games where extra/different routes may seem a bit clunky. I really enjoyed the writing, clearly a lot of knowledge and research went into this, and it's nice to see an 18th, 19th century British literature influenced writing style. That said, it may be a bit stuffy to read at first and the characters seem very pompous, but that is due to the influences and style the game has. The art is quite gorgeous, and while eerie I think it is perfect for this VN. I felt that my choices do matter, and in trying to please everyone, ended up turning everyone away (one or more of the routes).\n\nThoughts, story-wise:You will be put into the head of someone who is depressed, quite literally. You'll follow her thoughts and inner dialogue. For me, I got irritated, but then reconciled in cycles, even if I knew that these thoughts cannot be controlled by the mind you are in. The dialogue hit me hard, because a lot of it was the eerily similar with conversations I would have with a friend, who would in real life, explain her mind like how Samantha does. The dynamics are captured very well, and hit me in a very personal, emotional spot. I've had ups and downs with said person, and the dialogue for both the good parts and bad parts are relatable and it hurt.\n\nConclusion:This game is amazing, to me. It made me feel emotions like The Cat Lady has been able to produce in me. It hits home and I relate to it from past experiences. I would try to find all the endings right this instance, if I didn't have exams. And I will - this game, after reading only a couple endings, has constantly been on my mind. [Edit: shortly before exams I found all the endings...] I know this game is not for everyone - if you don't like VNs, if you don't like depression and other heavy themes, please stay away. Subjectively, I highly recommend this game.","August 5, 2015","true","4.7"," 128 of 132 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","128","132","2","0"

Characters are sufficiently expressive, and there are some really beautiful shots and backgrounds to be seen. I don’t think this is going to be everyone’s cup of tea, but I can’t think of many other titles that had as distinctive art work.\n\nThe game also has quite a unique writing style, though not without faults. Clearly based on the writing that came out of the Romantic Era (or there about), the very formal and ‘proper’ pool of words used is entreatingly varied and vivid. It’s refreshing to read, and has some very effective descriptions. The game sometimes has an issue on delivering exposition, and can sometimes come on a little strong when hammering in a point, but overall, I would rate the writing fairly well.\n\nAs for the characters, there’s also some interesting things going on, but there are weaknesses. I thought the fact that every character was named after and KIND OF loosely based on old writers and poets was a nice touch, and fit the style of writing. There is certainly a varied cast, each carrying their own themes and touches, with a solid four romantic interests.* However, there’s a weird issue going on: everyone’s kind of short with each other. This makes sense for a lot of the pairings (Roberta and Georgina, for example, who are polar opposites), however everyone feels pretty quick to say aloud the faults they find in the others. Even when it’s meant in good grace and good fun, this comes up oddly often, and makes one or two characters straddle the line to being unlikeable (even if only unlikable for a single scene). Not sure if that’s got something to do with the writing style or anything, but it’s hardly a deal breaker, just an odd quirk.\n\nOverall, I’d say the game was perfectly fine. It has its faults to be sure, and it was never going to be everyone’s kind of thing, but there’s a lot to like in there.\n\n*Edit: I've been told it may not be straight up romance in all of the routes, or that it might be "heavy subtext" etc. Be warned.","August 5, 2015","true","3.6"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","31","34","0","0"

I absolutely love visual novels with references to classic literature, and while reading Dejection, I was impressed with the writer's ability to imitate the style of that period without making it too dense for modern readers. I felt very empathetic towards both Samantha and Lillian, its only two characters, especially during one well-placed run-on sentence about Samantha's feelings. I couldn't wait to read more, and the next game managed to somehow exceed my already-high expectations.\n\nAsphyxia makes the heroines of Dejection teenagers and sends them on a school trip in a semi-modern setting – there's modern technology, but still a very old-fashioned feel to everything – with several of their colleagues. This expansion of the world of the story doesn't seem to stretch the creator too thinly at all, however, as it is still beautifully written. And while the art in Dejection is very cute, the art in Asphyxia is downright gorgeous. It really fits the setting well, as does the lovely music.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Asphyxia really made me develop strong feelings for the characters – even more so than I had expected. I loved Samantha, and wished that I could help her overcome her problems, despite the fact that their similarities to my own would probably make that impossible. (mild spoilers:)I couldn't help but love and empathize with Lillian as well, because of how much I related to Samantha, whose feelings for Lillian are so real and believable. And while some of the other characters seemed irritating at first, they all grew on me as more dimensions of their personalities became evident. There were things I liked about them all, and the only thing I didn't like about their story was that it eventually had to end.\n\nI recommend that anyone who's at all remotely interested download and read Dejection, which is both free and quite short, and then buy Asphyxia if they like it. Also, definitely read the notes in the “extras” section once you've played it. Even if you're an English major like me, there are bound to be some interesting details you didn't know that were referenced in the game! It's really a very well-researched project on top of its other great qualities. It's definitely on my list of favourite visual novels I've ever read.","August 15, 2015","true","5.8"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","27","32","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/animusfurandi/recommended/386990/","animusfurandi","Animus Furandi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/animusfurandi/","1585 products in account","Asphyxia is a difficult visual short story. It's odd to hear games of this genre described as "difficult," since they're barely games at all, but Asphyxia packs an awful lot of terribly trying reading into so small a package. The story is driven almost entirely by its cast, and if the author weren't so adept at creating excellent, if not particularly likable characters, the whole effort would have fallen flat on its face. And that's really the trouble with Asphyxia: You don't like the characters, but that's what makes them good characters. The protagonist is morose, obsessive, and horribly depressing, and the rest of the cast spends much of the story being cruel to one another. The whole thing would have ended up very Dickensian if not for all of the moments where the facades get dropped and it becomes evident that the characters are actually three-dimensional...Well, that and the lack of mutilations through horrible industrial accidents.\n\nI suppose I say all of that in order to say this: Asphyxia is worth your time, even though it's short, and even though it's utterly depressing. I was left with the impression that there was a ton of work packed into so short a story. Ebi-hime's knack for diction and characterization is difficult to come by in any medium, making it evident that they're a strong writer, if one that could benefit from an editor. I spotted quite a few grammatical errors in my playthroughs, and some of the petty squabbles between characters really just went on and on far longer than they needed to, belaboring the point that X and Y don't care for one another. Beautiful music and artwork contribute much to the story, making the characters and setting all the more engrossing. All things considered, Asphyxia isn't just worthwhile, it's really pretty good. It takes the reader through a wide range of emotions in a short period of time, leaving its audience exhausted and frustrated, but still wanting more.","October 20, 2015","true","4.5"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","0"

The characters felt very real in how they interacted with each other, and I often found myself thinking, "I've had these thoughts before," in response to the main character's bleak musings. Even in its gloominess, the writing still had many clever little lines that made me laugh. The few times modern world contraptions like phones and the internet are brought up in the narrative, it felt weird and out of place, but not enough to take you out of the game.\n\nThe art fits the implied aesthetics of the writing and is generally polished with the exception of some of the characters' awkward poses. The one thing that could use definitely some work is the UI; it got a bit hard to read the text when the backgrounds turned light.\n\nTook about 5 hours to get all four routes, and funny enough, it made me want to sit down afterwards and learn about the Lake Poets. So, there's that video game edutainment angle for you, I guess.\n\nOverall it's a great experience that's well worth the low price.","August 18, 2015","true","10.5"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

Art is truly beautiful, so if you're looking for nice backgrounds/emoticons/cards, that would be a good choice. I love visual novels and it really breaks my heart whenever I must write a negative review, especially for a game that I truly wanted to play. "Asphyxia" seemed like a game I would enjoy. I was immediately intrigued by description and whole concept, but... The story is not really that interesting. Actually, it's kind of annoying. I know who was the inspiration for main characters, so I fully understand "poetic" narrative. The problem is, none of the characters were interesting to me. I kind of like Roberta, but that would be it. Protagonist is so annoying that I think it's almost impossible to feel connection with her. I gave this game two chances - first right after I bought it. I couldn't force myself to play to the end, it was too boring and I wasn't invested into the story at all. But I really didn't wanted to give it a bad review. So I decided to give it some time and play it again. I did that. Same result.\n\nStill, game is rather cheap (especially during sales) so I think fans of visual novels should give it a try.","November 29, 2015","false","4.3"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","0"

I enjoyed every minute of it. It's a history lesson about the 'Romantic' movement within 18th century English literature and poetry, disguised as a Visual Novel. The game also contains a whole load of philosophy, so if you're into that kind of stuff (I know I am, I love me some philosophical concepts within video games)  you're going to have a great time with this game. Be aware though, this game tackles quite the heavy subjects (depression, suicide, abandonment issues, poverty, drug abuse so on and so forth) so be prepared for that. {Some parts of the game hit close to home, it made the experience all the more overwhelming)\n\nAlso:\n- the game has multiple routes/endings\n- the game has nice cg's and overall artwork\n- the game has trading cards and achievements\n\nSo basically, if you have 8 hours of free time and want to read a beautiful and thought provoking story, or you just want to play a high(er) quality Visual Novel, in comparison to some of the other Visual Novels found within the steam store, Asphyxia will not let you down. I suggest you give this game a go!\n\n\nRating: 9,5 / 10, overall great experience, but the dialogue is a bit archaic at times\n\nPro tip: After getting all the endings and beating the game, pour yourself a glass of Scotch and let the game sink in because there are a lot of positive life lessons to be learned from this game. If you don't drink, simply just go outside, take a walk (preferably the countryside, by the end of the game you'll know why it matters) and let the game sink in.\n\nFinal Thoughts: I want to thank the writer/dev of Asphyxia for making such a gem of a game. It was a pleasant experience to go through the story and I will definitely play more games from this writer/dev in the future!","February 10","true","8.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Over twenty minutes to explain that the MC was always late, has a crush on another student, and has a best friend whom thinks it's best you don't cut your own hair?\n\nMultiple times characters repeated themselves only using different words to express the same sentiment. I tried to push through it but the progression was plodding and the dialogue was priggish and without substance. It is as if the writer confused "stuffy" for "victorian" and ran with that idea.\n\nI do think the art style is pleasant and fitting to the theme but it is wildly inappropriate to the narrative. The character design is not suitable to the subject matter (and expletives) and I'm given to wonder if the character design was an attempt to extend the target market beyond English majors (especially given the overt sexualization of De Quincey).\n\nI couldn't recommend this and had it not been attached to a bundle purchase I would refund it. However, given the number of positive reviews, I can only assume my earlier assertion: I am not in the target market and would not have purchased this game normally so please weigh my opinion appropriately.","October 25, 2015","false","1.1"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/angelwolfchild/recommended/386990/","angelwolfchild","angelwolfchild","http://steamcommunity.com/id/angelwolfchild/","140 products in account","I was drawn to this visual novel entirely by the art, music and concept. The artwork is very different to the more traditional anime style usually seen in visual novels, with a watercolour look and more classical character designs, all accentuated by the multiple pieces of music that accompany each section. It was however that setup which really caught my attention, as we have here interpretations of classical English poets reimagined as adorable students. Despite the change in age and gender, it’s fun to see traits from the real poets show through, my favourite example being the flirtatious and crafty Georgia Byron who certainly lives up to her namesake.\n\nHonestly I could easily recommend purchasing Asphyxia purely on these aesthetic choices, but there is actually a story beneath them.  It’s extremely well-written, with some great character development and quite a few humorous moments. However… it’s a heavy story. Our main protagonist Samantha suffers some mental problems, contemplates suicide and spends a good portion of the story in a state of depression that, depending on your choice, can either get steadily worse or be overcome or even denied. I confess that I struggled to get through the story, not because it’s bad by any means, but because I personally couldn’t get into Samantha’s mind-set most of the time and found it difficult to go and make those darker choices to get the other endings, and some of those left an unpleasant feeling afterwards. But as I said do not take this to mean it’s bad, I commend the writers for tackling this topic with such maturity and it is written incredibly well, plus those darker moments make the happy and funny sections all the more rewarding and heart-warming.\n\nOverall Asphyxia is a beautiful visual novel, with gorgeous artwork, lovely music and a charmingly unique setup, all wrapping a deeply emotional story. I highly recommend that you give it a try, but do be aware that it can get very heavy at times.","January 7","true","6.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Life Is Strange is in my library, because who can resist time travel and the butterly effect colliding beautifully in a French-made game with beautiful indie music backing it? Yes, I compared it to Gone Home in my review, but that comes from its origins within the 3-D walking simulator type of game.\n\n\nBasically, all you need to know is that Asphyxia is a game in which the major Romantic poets of the late 18th century are reimagined as cute schoolgirls. Does this work? I personally have to say that the author of the VN has certainly done his research, but also the characters are so beleiveable, so well-written, that there was hardly ever a moment where I thought, "OK this is where they are making reference to something, or writing, verbatim, what these middle-aged male authors said some 300 years ago," because the characters are so beleivable, the source material has been worked in almost seamlessly. The VN's writer, Ebi-Hime, is definitely on my radar now.\n\nA lot of the reviews are coming from the, completely optional, I might add, lesbian romance side of things, again drawing a comparison to Gone Home. There seem to be multiple endings, and while there are subtextual references to how Samantha feels around Lillian, there are certainly many endings where they do not end up as a couple. I appreciate that the relationship, while somewhat forced at times, can certainly not come to fruition in what is certainly meant to be a melancholie game. I would not have purchased this game in the first place, if it was yet another teen/LGBT drama that was forced out of contrivacy such as Gone Home, however the author gave it to his audience to make of it what they will.\n\nSamantha Coleridge is certainly a protagonist you want to root for, while she drinks energy drinks and absinthe to the point of vomiting, and stands freezing in the Scottish countryside wondering just how to win her friendship (Optional/obvious lesbian relationship) back with Lillian, you will be a part of her thoughts, which is why this is a good novelization, and you will struggle with her. Of course I have a particular affinity for redheads, and suffice it to say that Samantha is cute, like the other characters in this game, I wasn't wholly on board with all the avenues that she takes, for instance, the cigarette smoking, Someone I wanted to like smoking cigarettes I could have done without, and I parsed through the text referencing it.\n\nPros:\nA writer whose dedication to his/her craft shows throughout, with numerous references to Romantic poets.\nCute, redheaded protagonist, who doesn't fall victim to gender steryotypes.\n\nCons:\nEverything just has to be LGBT for some reason. Don't get me wrong I work with gay people on a daily basis, but few people realize that less than 5% of people (at least here in the USA) so for such a small minority, they sure are outspoken. I'm not sure if this is the author's perspective, or if they are trying to appeal to a broader demographic, but it always illicits an eyeroll from me.\n\nIt's an indie game, so I can hardly count it against the game, but I wished there was a cast of voice actors/actresses.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n7/10: Cute animated girls, with clever references and writing alluding to the major Romantic poets of the late 18th century. If not for the repetitive RPG-maker music and shoehorned and completely unneccessary lesbian/LGBT ties, it would have been best in its class.\n","January 22","true","3.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Like seriously.\n\nAnd to besmirch the great Romantics by portraying them as bickering, simpering school gir--\nWait a minute....\nThe Romantics acted just like a bunch of adolescent school girls! In this instance, it works!\n\nAnd does it ever! It is so gratiating, thought-provoking, and geeky to read this Romantic-themed visual novel that focuses on the troubled  Sam(antha) Taylor Coleridge's obsessive and dependent relationship with the conservative Wi(llian) Wordsworth.\n\nI was also a bit respulsed to see a curator recommending this because of it exploring alternative sexualities. That isn't the point of the narrative. It isn't fan service. There is no Hentai. It is about the very real fascination and agrandizement that many of the Romantics had with William Wordsworth, and briefly mentions the rumours that Byron has bisexual relationships-- but not with any of the characters in the game.\n\nSo don't be fooled by the appearance of this game. It's not a perverted anime visual novel. It's a serious reflection on all of the major themes of Romanticism-- the innocence of childhood, the corruption of adulthood, and the nostalgia for the past. The game focues heavily on the issue of logic vs. feelings, the issues with excess, and takes place in an ideal and beautiful natural setting.\n\nI recommend it for anyone struggiling with depression, too, as Samantha will be as mirror-like as still water in some ways.\n","November 6, 2015","true","19.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

No? Well, you should.\n\nAsphyxia is a grim game that wholly deserves the attention of all its readers. Don't be deceived by the cute art, the game focuses on the worrying condition of the protagonist and the troublesome life she follows. Any fan of literature will enjoy this game, as it feels like a classic novel. But, whether you know the poets or not, the game does a splendid job of getting you into the characters. If you do know the poets though, you'll find your nerdy poetry loving heart a little tickled as there are a number of things you'll just /get/. In the extras, there are biographies of the poets that you can read for more insight as well.\n\nThe writing is great and it captures the condition of Samantha perfectly. Samantha is a realistic character and if you read through it and find yourself unable to relate to all her plights, know that I have. This game had me leaning over to see if my secret stash of angsty poetry had been invaded.\n\nI can say that I don't regret this at all, and I don't think many people will. It's a wonderful piece of writing and it sweeps you along into all the emotions involved. It's grim, emotional, depressing and a great experience.\n\nNow...if only it was longer....\n","August 8, 2015","true","4.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

The very first sentence under "About This Game" is very telling - this is a game about depression, and complicated romantic feelings, and anxiety, told through the interactions of several girls at boarding school, named Shelley, Byron, Coleridge, Wordsworth, etc.\n\nThere's a lot of emotional heavy lifting going on in this VN, and I'm really conflicted about how all the characters interact--on the one hand it reads crushingly accurate to how a lot of people with individual problems are going to slap and bite and scratch at each others' weak points, which is very well done.  That same accuracy is also devastating, particularly if you have personal experience with depression or anxiety, and the "helpful" ways some people will try to interact with mental illness.\n\nI did find it substantially less tiresome to click through new routes than with some other VNs, and the art is lovely.","November 29, 2015","true","2.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But only because it's tiring and boring.\nI'm not calling it bad by any means, but i barely could stand just one playthrough. Practially nothing happens, the whole story is mostly filled with emotions. Oh, so many emotions. So many things are sad, everyone has issues, and the mood is always very melancholic.\nIt could be good. I believe it could be really, really good, but Asphyxia just doesn't deliver. As a player, i didn't connect with characters at all and their emotions were just very boring for me.\nI understand what this is supposed to be, i really do, but it just doesn't come through, at least for me. Because everything is supposed to be very, very poetic, it is heavy to stomach and gets worse with every moment. The writing is a complete miss for me.\nThe art is pretty and would be so nice if characters didn't look like ~13 years olds while they are supposed to be around 17. How much of eye-candy the characters are creates a really huge gap between themes of this game and what you see. Yeah, she has problems and apparently looks like a wreck, but shes also a beautiful young girl almost straight out of your loli mangas! It annoyed me greatly.\nWhat actually WAS good, was music. For me it was the only thing setting the mood and responsible for the scraps of connection with game i felt (which was like, three times, maybe). For that, good job.\nIn overall, i don't recommend this game. Maybe it's just me who doesn't enjoy a eating brick in my sandwich, as that's how this game felt for me, but nevertheless i don't think i enjoyed this game even a bit.","February 16","false","7.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

My other self, my platonic egg - my soulmate, if you will!". People don't speak like that. Teenagers especially. The language gets even more confusing with the sudden switch from polite 'gosh' and 'darn' to repeated use of actual curse words. On the up side, the editing errors are fairly mild compared to most other visual novels, things like 'man' instead of 'fan', and referring to a field as a room. Interesting topics are explored, but the writing style hampers my ability to be emotionally attached to any of the stories.\n\nFrom here on, my review is spoiler heavy;\n\nOn costumes; Not all the schoolgirl characters are wearing the school uniform on their class trip, one's in inappropriate attire for a schoolgirl and the teacher doesn't seem to care, yet she reprimands the one who didn't do her blouse up. That student continues to walk around with the blouse undone. Lillian goes swimming in her underwear while it's freezing. Instead of assuming she's attempting suicide, Samantha remarks that "Lillian was a sensible person, of course she would have ensured her pinafore and cardigan didn't get wet.". Three different characters go for a walk at night in their PJs and nothing else for no real reason other than, I suspect, the artist not wanting to draw them in coats. Samantha puts more effort into her hair when she's in her PJs than when she's dressed for school. Lillian and Samantha both wear chokers to bed for some reason. De Quincey wears the least comfortable underwear to bed. One of the named and present characters doesn't get a portrait at all.\n\nOn the topic of age, the schoolgirls are repeatedly referred to as teenagers (Samantha and Lillian are 17), but they look more like preteens - even the teacher looks like a child. The sound effect for 'chattering schoolgirls' sounds distinctly like a mixed gender class of preteens. This makes the numerous references to smoking, drinking, De Quincey and Samantha 'experimenting' with a wide variety of illegal substances, homelessness, assault,  the constant talk of self harm and suicide, and the discussion of the sex lives of several of the characters extremely jarring. The juxtaposition of the childish looks and apparent adult behaviour destroys any suspension of disbelief I may have developed. If the characters looked their age it would be less jarring as those are the types of things 17 and 18 year olds would be dealing with/doing. As it is, they look like they're 12 or younger.","October 21, 2015","false","3.0"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","1"

Unlike anything I've read, truly a wonderful experience. It's another gem by Ebi-hime, however this is a very different VN. The characters are loosely based off of the romantic poets of the past like Samuel Coleridge and William Wordsworth, but with a modern twist. Their relationship in the game shadows their relationship as it was in real life all those years ago. It makes for a very unique and interesting story and I thought it was a nice touch; plus you learn a lot. The dialogue is all very well spoken, it feels like reading an old book, still very enjoyable. Each character has their own story that you want to know more about, and they all eventually grow on you.\n\nIt's a darker story dealing with depression, love, and loss. It has some cute moments, but a little gloomy. Ebi-hime's writing is incredibly emotional and touched my heart. There are many different endings. The art is breathtaking, reminiscent of watercolor paintings.

The stylized dialogue lost its charm as soon as I realized the setting is contemporary, and instead became obnoxious. The characters and the narrator talk and talk and talk, without saying anything substantial or interesting. Seriously, 35 minutes in and hardly anything happened. The characters are annoying and one-dimensional. Perhaps there is some character development later on, but I cna barely make myself play it in 10-minute bursts.\n\nIt's boring.

Almost fell asleep hitting spacebar for more conversation.\n\nGame like “Choose Your Own Adventure” books for relationships, but less opportunities for choice. Story pretty depressing if you ask Prunk. Prunk wanted to take main character, Samantha, and shake her, tell her she has no good friends, to get better friends or be better alone, to stop looking for happiness with other people, but no choice for that and made Prunk sad.\n\nPrunk think interesting how creators used famous female poets as characters set in today’s time but their voices no come out in dialogue. Had to keep checking who was talking.\n\nArt was very pretty and sad music was good.

It's all my opinion, and as a visual novel, the game is particularly subjective.\nAsphyxia aspires to be this groundbreaking, poetic piece of writing, but in doing so treads the same tired ground we've seen countless times throughout lgbt media. I ask you, writers of the world over, what about "happy lesbians" vexes you? Better yet, why are you so bent on sad gays?\n\nWhile I'm not done digging at the writing, I'd like to pause to mention the art. The character models are designed to maximize loli-appeal, in that they're dually infanticizing and sexualizing. It's creepy, and also doesn't mesh with the narrative. Our protagonist is described every scene as an absolute wreck, but how am I supposed to believe that when her model is a perfect porcelain doll?\n\nAs for the writing in general, the piece can only be described as stylistically arrogant, too caught up in its own self-assured greatness to actually go anywhere. Imagery is used seemingly without cause or care. The characters are drawn too far into the pits of despair to be relatable to any but the most unfortunate of individuals.\nThe game fumbles with  a number of difficult, powerful themes; substance abuse, suicide, homelessness, mental illness, manipulative relationships, girl x girl romance, and other assorted feminist issues; in a display that comes across as mocking to each of those themes.\nAnd that's another matter: there is no closure here. Zero. If you are twisted into some form of attachment to the plot threads or characters, you're bound to be dissapointed by how those are cut and forgotten, in a sort of meta-commentary about how the stories of the marginalized are discarded and ignored, though I can't imagine such insight was intended.","August 5, 2015","false","0.5"," 33 of 95 people (35%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","35","33","95","4","7"

The art is beautiful, and its a horrifyingly accurate depiction of mental illness. I would like to point out, while she never really has a diagnosis, it's heavily implied that Sam has Depression. However, I think her actions and situation fit perfectly for someone who has Borderline Personality Disorder. If you felt you could identify with her feelings and struggles I would highly suggest looking into it for yourself. Very sucessful treatments are availaible!!!\n\nANYWAY, Back to the game itself: I think I enjoyed it so much because it was freakishly similar to my own personal story- but with perspective and storytelling that comes with a game. It has helped feel better about my own situation. I cried so much, holy ♥♥♥♥. Tip: if you can make it past the scenes in the coach, it gets much more interesting and involved, so don't be afraid to stick it out even if the beginning bores you.\n\nOther than that, the dialouge is a bit posh and the time spent inbetween periods of action is extensive, so if you feel you can't identify with the story you may not enjoy it. What makes the long dialouge bearable are the emotions you get from it. It's very moving. I would have appreciated more character diversity in terms of body type and skin color but other than that I have no complaints. Also, every little desicion counts. As far as I can tell there are about 6-8 "Endings"- but there are actually only 3-4 scenes in which you make choices, which demonstrates how much each one matters. It makes the play simple but still significant, which I really liked.\n\nI played this instead of studying for a test... 10/10 would procrastinate again.","December 3, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each choice has dramatic impact on the outcome of events. My first play through was completed in 2½ hours including some time alt tabbed while I searched for other games done by Ebi-Hime. The art and soundtrack are beautiful and fitting for the atmosphere of the game.\n\nAsphyxia, at first, comes off as grandiloquent, however, this unifies with the florid motif of the rest of the game into a harmonious and concerted aesthetic.\n\nIf you're still reading after that last sentence then you'll be just fine with the diologue in this game.\n\nPerhaps because I've been struggling, and losing, with exactly the feelings we see Samantha trying to understand within herself, having tried desparatly to reconcile these feelings in exactly the same ways she did, and am ultimately considering the same solutions she has, I may be not be as objective in my review. However, as each person, no matter how hard they try to avoid it, carries the baggage of their lives with them and has their view of the world coloured by their own experiences, it is impossible to be absolutely objective; why not indulge in subjectivity instead!\n\nI don't feel that the subject matter in this game is particularly grim, rather, it is an exploration of the human condition. It addresses the fears and insecurities one faces when building and nurturing real relationships. It is a love story but not a love story in the romantic sense; It is about the idea of love as a basic need and what value it holds to us at our core. It is about our need for acceptance and how this is handled. You will not find a heartwarming story about overcoming trials and becoming stronger person. You will not feel the warmth and tenderness of a blossoming romance. What you will feel is the helpssness, emptyness, and fragile life of somebody who constantly wears a smile to hide their desperate stuggle to find even the smallest reason to live.\n\nAsphyxia will leave you with a heavy sense of dissatisfaction. It is not a comfortable story and it does not leave you with a sense that everything will be okay in the end.\n\nThat is precisely the reason I love it.\n\nAsphyxia is not a game for everybody. In fact, I think it's not a game for most people. Asphyxia is a game for people who feel deeply and often; those of us who interpret and communicate with the world through our emotions rather than thought even though we know, intimately, that we will get hurt in the end.","November 7, 2015","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Keep in mind however that many of the sections get dragged out, and you will spend a large chunk of the time reading moderately long sections of text, which is what many may or may not come to expect out of this type of game. If heaps of text won't bother you, then you can enjoy the beautiful atmosphere the story builds and have a look into the troubles each character faces.","November 16, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For example, I didn't like Lilian, and it wasn't for the same reason Roberta did. But, well, I think it's good that you like or dislike some characters because it means that they do invoke some emotions in you.

Granted it is rather short but the art style is ridiculously gorgeous and so full of detail + the writing is so good it just makes everything work. The story is rather depressing and really draws you into feeling what the main character (Samantha) feels. It lets you know how depression and anxiety work and how terrible they both can be when mixed together. I only got the first three Steam achievements and I am excited to get the rest. My favorite character has to be hands down Georgia Byron.\n\n10/10 Better believe it. That's my score right there!\n\nI know it is short but I don't mind short visual novels at all when the writing is that good and makes you feel a certain way that is too real and allows you to connect with the characters to the point where you attach yourself emotionally to them. Also the background music goes hand in hand with the visual novel's overall aesthetic. This is probably the more serious 'review' I've tried to take my time to write because I feel like Asphyxia deserves it.\n\nPlease give this Visual Novel by ebi-hime a chance. I'm sure you won't regret it unless it ends up being far too depressing for you. Also, the writing was trying to emulate the writing style of a certain era just so we're clear here and you understand that it's not being overly pretentious by doing this or anything. Ebi-Hime thought it would be a great idea to use real life poets as cute girls doing cute things in her own wonderful and emotionally driven visual novel.\n\nIf you go to the 'Extras' section you'll get interesting information on who each character is based on.\nSorry for the lengthy review! I am madly in love with this visual novel, as you can see.","February 22","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I understand that the more "heavy" parts/themes are meant to be lighted up by this but I think the writer is overdoing it (not just here, in "The Sad Story of Emmeline Burns" too).\n\nI like the character art a lot as it is more memorable than the cliche anime looks you get from most other visual/kinetic novels or animes/mangas in general. However everyone looks like a young kid, even the class teacher. It isn't necessarily going too well with how old the characters are meant to be (~18 from what I remember). They sometimes, rather abruptly, talk about sex, alcohol, cigarettes and (if I got that part right) prostitution and if you haven't realized by then that the with no exception overly cute or childish looks of them are just looks you can feel irritated. Since the game is sort of self-referencing this discrepancy at one point the writer seems to be aware of it. Maybe that's an element of Yuri, as is that male characters are only mentioned (if at all) along the side and never in a very good light. I haven't been dealing with that subgenre much and don't intend to do more than I have to.\n\nThe way depression is handled/shown nevertheless deserves praise, and along with the music and (age questions aside) great art made it still a nice experience to me. I could relate to the protagonist well, her thoughts and explanations felt true and honest and touched me, the other characters can be pretty interesting too, and you can tell the writer probably has gone through some sort of depression herself (or friends/relatives of her) to be able to describe it as believable as she has done in Asphyxia.","February 24","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm quiet frankly sad to say I would rather have seen an artbook with these pictures than paid full fare for Asphyxia.\n\nThe gameplay is almost none existing. Now, I've played these interactive stories before and I've come across a lot of them where, while there are much text, there are also a lot of choices in between these texts, equally divided and that actually seems to impact your story greatly. Asphyxia throws waves upon waves of text at you and just a few meagre choices that are only affecting the ending you'll get. The text is trying very hard for a melodramatic tone but I found myself feeling like most of it was simple filler and I will confess that after my first play through I simply turned on the “skip text” option so that I could unlock all the endings.\n\nThere is not a bad idea in Asphyxia and once more the artwork is stunning but there is too much text and to little choices.

Some will like it and many might love it but many will be bored or frustrated by it . That said, this is the kind of story that I'm always happy to see more of in games, one with progressive themes that aspires to be something literary, even if it is ultimately bland and the the crudely obvious references to English Literature are grating. It contains the characters 'Alexandra Taylor Coleridge' and 'Lillian Wordsworth', which are much more than gentle nods.\n\nThe story is grounded in reality, telling a tale of teenage depression and angst, but its characters and their conversations are not (perhaps fitting the literature it is, by the author's admission, inspired by). The characters do not speak like real people. Most of the time they sound as if they have been plucked from an A Level essay. You get used to it, but it is often jarring and gets in the way of telling a convincing story about love and friendship. Conversations also tend to carry on far too long, with characters repeating themselves or stating quite plainly how they feel about their relationships.\n\nDespite all this though, by the end of a playthrough I was not left feeling bitter towards the game as I was when I was halfway through. It has its humerous moments and at least some of the cast of at first immensely unlikable characters eventually endear themselves to you which I will assume, to be kind to the game, was the intent. This is a classic example of a game that teeters between a thumbs up and a thumbs down. I enjoyed it just enough to recommend it (and perhaps that's simply because I played it a day after visiting the Lake District myself) though I know many would regret their time with it. It is by no means a must play but I am glad that it exists.\n\nA note on interactivity:\nThere are few points at which you can make choices to diverge the story and the protagonist is very much their own character, and quite a frustrating character at that. You have no real means of shaping who they are. This is very much a story about them, not you. If you want a visual novel that lets you adopt a role like that I would recommend something by the wonderful Hanako Games, like Magical Diary. In fact, the most important diverging point in Asphyxia, the one that pretty much defines how the story ends, doesn't even present itself as a decision of any significance.","April 10","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I get the impression that I’m supposed to feel for the main character, but I could not get invested in her or the other characters.  A big issue is that the tone of the game always felt off.  The visuals are beautiful, but the characters look like children when they are supposed to be high school seniors.  Even the teacher looks like a child.  The setting seems like it is taking place in old timey England, but then we see the characters have cell phones and explicitly state that this is the twenty-first century.  Much of the dialogue is rather verbose and repetitive, and there were large tangents that didn’t really contribute to the narrative.  It got to the point where I was not interested in seeing what happens and just wanted to get to end.  It doesn’t help that the game keeps referencing an incident from the past but doesn’t explain what it was except in one ending.  Even then, it doesn’t really explain why that incident causes the heroine’s life to fall apart.  Flashbacks would have helped in setting the tone and help garner sympathy for the heroine.
