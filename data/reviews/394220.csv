Earth has somehow been destroyed and you and your ship are all that’s left. Your job is to find another, hospitable planet and re-establish the human race there. Along the way you’ll need to stop on barren planets to collect fuel as well as collect life from other planets to terraform your new home. Perhaps you’ll even find some other survivors along the way.\n\nPresentation\nLast Horizon is very basic in its presentation throughout but that’s not a bad thing, in fact the minimalist design really suits the game. It’s rather colourful and while all of the models are fairly basic they all look good. The UI is out of your way for the most part but it when it is there it gets the job done without getting in your way. The only issue I had with the presentation is a minor one, the mouse cursor stays visible when you’re playing. Those of you who have read my other reviews will know that this is one of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to gaming and Last Horizon will not escape my wrath! Seeing as you never need the mouse during gameplay (even the menu doesn’t require the mouse) it seems completely stupid, and distracting, to have the mouse cursor visible. But like I said, not a major issue (though the time spent on complaining about it might suggest otherwise).\n\nGameplay\nLast Horizon’s gameplay is again fairly basic (that seems to be a running theme does it not?). You begin one of four missions on what remains on Earth and then you’ll blast off, in search of your new home. Other planets will be pointed out to you in the form of arrows at the edges of your screen. A blank arrow means a barren planet. An arrow filled with white means a planet with some form of life on it. A coloured arrow means a planet with sentient life on it. You’ll need to stop at the first of these two to collect resources and you’ll probably want to avoid the last one.\n\nSpeaking of resources, there are three:\nOre – Used to repair the hull of your ship\nOxygen – Used to refill your oxygen tanks\nFuel – Used to refill your oxygen tanksStopping on a planet with life on it will allow you to collect the life from it to be used on your own planet. Taking half will give you a fair amount of points while allowing the planet to survive and taking all of the planet’s life will give you more points but kill off the planet, unless you really care about planets made of particles I’d suggest taking it all to maximise your points.\n\nBack to those missions I mentioned earlier. The first mission is the most basic and therefore easiest. Each mission after that adds a new gameplay element which makes the mission slightly harder than the last. I honestly didn’t notice a huge difference in difficulty between the four different missions so it’s effectively playing the same mission again with some slight variation.\n\nMiscellaneous The soundtrack fits well with the feel of the game but it’s nothing too special.\nThe game doesn’t support controllers which is strange since it plays a lot better with a controller. I’d strongly recommend using Controller Companion for this game if you own it.\nOptions are non-existent apart from a fullscreen toggle.\nWhile the layout of the planets is supposedly procedurally generated for the missions it seemed to me like each mission had a default layout that only had some slight differences each time I restarted a mission. Due to this the game has very little replayability in my eyes.\nAnother one of my pet peeves, the game doesn’t require you to give it a confirmation when you press the quit button. I managed to quit a couple of times thanks to a misclick.\nIf you’re reasonably good at the game it could probably be completed in forty minutes.\nWant to know what Last Horizon looks like in action?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DncYZD8061c\n\nFor those using Controller Companion:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=559464171\n\nVerdict\nWorth Purchasing\n\nLost Horizon may not have a huge amount of content, but what’s there is a lot of fun to play. It looks good. It feels good. It sounds good. If you’re unsure, hold out for a discount but if you’re a fan of space exploration games then I’d suggest you pick this one up.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","November 22, 2015","true","1.7"," 63 of 74 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","63","74","4","3"

It's a great game for sitting back and relaxing. There's not a vast quantity of content, and is probably good for a couple of hours total here and there.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/recommended/394220/","randomiseuser","RandomiseUser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/","284 products in account","Last Horizon is a graceful 2D arcade game with gentle resource management strategy. It's simple and repetitive, but in a way that's compulsive - like the better arcade games of the 80s.\n\nAs you head to your new home, you consume fuel, oxygen and (if you keep bashing into things) hull integrity. To replace these resources, you find a planet and land on it anywhere safe.\n\nBut the planet's resources are finite and allocated at random, so you might not be able to fill all three things to the top. Your scanner will let you know what's available before you land - but it's rare this makes much of a strategic difference given the sheer number of planets. Provided you aren't continually coming in on fumes, you won't come a cropper.\n\nGameplay video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Mj8z5jfPs8\n\nThere are planets that hold special resources (ie colonies and terraforming gubs) that mainly exist to boost your score if you complete the level, but they also help steer the story and atmosphere. I was hoping these resources would have more of a gameplay effect, really.\n\nSo the strategy element isn't that challenging, but the arcadey bit is. The mechanics are based on Thrust, so landing on a planet is a case of carefully letting gravity guide you in as you reverse onto a clear patch of planet surface. If you're in a panic and come in too hot, it's easy to side-swipe a mountain and kill yourself.\n\nThe rest of space can be tricky, too. Asteroids collide with moons and send them hurtling into the nearest planet. Black holes appear at the last moment. Binary star systems can inspire both awe and terror as you thread the needle of two suns' gravity wells.\n\nThere are also alien ships and planets. They start off benign, but later aliens begin to resent your presence and you may not be able to linger in some areas of space very long. You can land on their planets to refuel, but you'd better be quick before the missiles arrive!\n\nAll these moments tends to be exciting rather than a source of frustration. There's not much more stuff to discover beyond them, though.\n\nThere are a small handful of unlockable levels in the version I played. The first few (Flights A, B and C) are essentially not random, as far as I could tell. All planets are in the same fixed location with only their resources changing from game to game. So it's not really a rogue-lite exploration game, more Thrust without borders.\n\nBut then you unlock Flight X, and the game becomes a lot less predictable. Each run is now different, and the level is much longer than the earlier ones. There are some VAST areas of space with no resources available, so you'll actually need to plot an intelligent course instead of heading vertically upwards and hoping for the best. This is the best way to play it - it's challenging, epic and forces you to consider your resources far more - consigning the first levels to quick practice modes.\n\nLast Horizon is a game of moments. It can be both funny and frustrating as you get tonked by an orbiting moon or swiped by a passing comet (swoooosh!). Like fellow ambient space exploration game RymdResa, it's a game that pretends to be calming, while repeatedly hurling rocks at you and sucking you across an event horizon. The main thing is that it's replayable enough for the price - but also feels like it misses a few opportunities to add the depth that would keep you playing for a long time to come.\n\n* More Randomise User indie game videos\n\nVersion played: 0.9.98.0\nThanks to the developers for providing a pre-release version for review.","November 18, 2015","true","3.9"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","1"

I really sucked at the game which didnt help the cause.\n\nIn the game you somehow manage to be the last human or well robot thing left and then you have to make your way to other planets sucking them of resources. There are also terraformed planets in which you can suck all their resources and watch that planet crumble too.\n\nThere are no options and the windowed screen puts it at a horrible resolution, with no resolution selector. It took me 10 minutes to figure that this was not the game for me. If you're into space exploration, survival and most definitely Lunar Lander (which is what this game reminded me of) then definitely get it.\n\nI just couldnt get into the game because I sucked too badly. The graphics and price are good though for what it is. You get 4 missions. I am unaware of how long they are though and the longevity of it and there are also 9 achievements.\n\nIf there is anything I'm missing or you feel I need to add please let me know.

Your world has been destroyed and you need to move to a new planet hopefully picking up life forms, other surviving humans, and avoid hostile aliens along the way.\n\nUnfortunately your fragile ship doesnt have the fuel or oxygen to do so and your forced to make many pit stops on random planets along the way. All have different gravitational pulls so landing can frequently be a bit hair raising especially when landing between two mountains, while avoiding a lava sea, while asteroids and comets slam into the surface around you...\n\nDid I mention their are black holes and aliens who want to blast you to man pulp?\n\nMy only criticism is the game is rather short and while its procedurally generated each time having only 4 different game modes each with an increased difficulty means you've probably got 2 - 4 hours of gameplay before you beat the game.\n\nThere is a leaderboard if becoming the "best" in the world is your thing and the game is priced nicely at $5 so in my opinion for the cost of about half the price of a movie you get a few hours of hair raising fun.\n\nFull video review below!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LreDNdVVIR8","November 20, 2015","true","1.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","2"

So, my dear astronauts - take control of your spaceship and find our next home!\n\nLast Horizon is an action/exploration game where you take control of a spaceship which has the capability to terraform ecosystems so when you reach your new home you will have all necessary resources for the human race. However, before you get there you will need to make sure you keep the fundamental resources you and your vessel needs to successfully reach your destination.\n\nYour spacecraft does not have any weapons whatsoever, all you have is fuel, oxygen and a hull (structure of your craft). As you take off and start your journey through space, you will very quickly see grey arrows coming up around the screen. These arrows will show you the planets that are in that direction.  You will use fuel and oxygen, and will without doubt have a few close encounters with meteors, shooting stars or even natural satellites, which will damage your hull; the only way to re-fill your gauges of fuel and oxygen as well as repairing your hull is to land safely and gently on those planets. Each landing will be rewarded by points; the best landing will give you 2000 points. Just a couple of hints for you: do not land in the water or anything pointy….Not a good idea! White arrows will tell you where to land your vessel to collect resources or rescue another human colonies.  Purple arrows are really fun - just go right at them and you will receive a warm welcome from an alien race who have firepower on their planet and also on their vessels. One of the best ways to get rid of these little pests is to lead them into a field of asteroids…. BOOM! Keep an eye on your fuel and oxygen for me or you will get Boomed too!\n\nA couple of other things you have to be careful of: black holes and suns - get to close to them and you will die!\n\nI really enjoy this game, play even if it can be quite frustrating at times (especially with these Alien pests), and for the control, I have absolutely no issues playing this game with the keyboard. I like the gravity feel when you reach a planet’s atmosphere - it is fun! Difficulty seems to double each time you beat a level. Nice 2D graphics and the game is really well priced.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Fun and challenging game\n-	Nice 2D graphics\n-	Easy to control\n-	Four flights to beat\n-	Achievements\n\nNegative:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	No weapons to defend yourself against the aliens\n-	A bit repetitive\n\nI really enjoy this game and I thoroughly recommend it!\n\n9/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/394220/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Concept: Last Horizon is a minimalistic space exploration and action game where the objective is to save the human race following the destruction of earth. In order to do this you will have to discover a habitable planet, colonize it and redevelop your civilization. Throughout this journey you will be required to accomplish mini objectives that come in the form of discovering, mining and collecting life and resources from other planets in order to terraform your new base planet. Throughout your journey you will come across other survivors.\n\nMinimalistic presentation: In staying true to the concept of the game everything featured within Last Horizon is kept to the bare minimum. In this regard we are talking graphics, sound, game play mechanics, the whole kit and caboodle. You may think that being so simplistic that it would subtract from the experience but it is a strong positive in the game. Everything is present when and where you need it to be and when you don’t you really are given the sensation that you are exploring an expansive universe. It’s an intelligent aesthetic that helps create a more immersive environment. Had Pixeljam gone the other way it would not have meshed nearly as well as what it does.\n\nInsane difficulty starting out (for average gamers): In my first few attempts at playing I felt like a space pinata or pinball. I was bouncing off of planets left and right. Apparently this is the experience that most players have. I didn’t feel as though there were nearly enough tutorial information in the game and while the developers may explain that it’s part of the basic nature of the game the information that is provided isn’t enough to to avoid early frustrations with the game. Certainly, once you have taught yourself how to play the game gets easier – yet obviously more rewarding – it’s a steep learning curve that will frustrate many gamers to the point of quitting before the game sucks them into its web.\n\nNo native controller: In my opinion Last Horizon is dying to be played by using a controller. It makes the game play so much easier and feels a lot more natural than when playing without it. However, disappointingly there is is no native controller support in the game. You’ll have to use a controller companion in order to play using one. This is, by far, the most grievous mistake in judgment that Pixeljam have made in the development of the game.\n\nNot a lot of content: If truth is told there isn’t a lot of content within Last Horizon. Once you learn how to play and become competent at the basic game play you may get a further hour or two tops out of the game. Learning how to play properly will likely be the most time consuming part of the title. It’s a good little game but you’re not going to get much mileage out of it. That’s not necessarily a bad thing but those of you seeking a longer game should look elsewhere. However, those of you looking for a more casual title who would like to spend an evening – or part thereof – with a good solid title will find this satisfying their need.\n\nLast Horizon is a very reasonable minimalist space exploration title that will provide you with a few hours of steady game play. In regards to a price-quality equation it’s about right.\n\nFor similar reviews and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 22","true","1.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I had trouble getting the resolution to work correctly. At first the game was a fullscreen window where almost everything was cut off and in the corner, I later discovered you can press "F" to switch the game to fullscreen. Since the part of the menu that shows the keys was cutoff I had to discover this by trial and error. There is no other way to set the resolution if it doesn't set correctly.\n\nUnfortunately the game doesn't remember your resolution setting and you have to manually set it everytime you open it.\n\nSteam overlay doesn't work and steam achievements aren't working.

While I did have good fun, it only lasted for the hour or so it took me to complete the first 4 maps, which are pretty similar to each other. The other 2 hours of gameplay  were from trying over and over, and repeatedly failing, to complete the game's fifth and last map, which is absolutely frustrating.\n\nThe difficulty curve in this game is so ♥♥♥♥ed up you might as well call it non-existent. The first level is a bit hard because you're still figuring out how to properly land. After you learn that, it's a walk in the park for the next 3 levels. On the fifth and last, however, the game basically becomes Dark Souls, only more unforgiving. You're being constantly chased by ships which fire lasers and guided missiles at you, with no way to fight back. When you do manage to shake them off, you're already low on oxygen and fuel and need to land on a planet to restock. Problem is, almost every time you land, the game's God punishes your insolence by summoning a bunch of asteroids that get attracted by the planet surface and rain upon it, meaning you have to quickly leave before you become space milkshake. When it's not the asteroids, it's more enemy ships coming from absolutely out of the blue already firing at you. There's no way to avoid drawing the attention of these ships, as your field of view is very narrow. By the time you're able to notice them, they're already firing at you.\n\nWith all that, you end up not having time to get enough resources, and you eventually die of suffocation or lack of fuel. Thus, I decided not to recommend a game with such a poorly thought out difficulty curve.","June 3","false","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But the basic premise is that you are the last human and you have to abandon Earth and find a new home. You must get to the 'Sanctuary' but at the same time harvest planets and maybe rescue some other humans on an other-worldly colony. From what I understand, for you to get a high score you have to land on planets and take as little damage as possible. I rate this game an 8/10. It's fun to cool off to, but at the same time you could rage pretty hard. Also I hope the devs update this game, because I see lots of potential for this game.\nP.S.

The game is fun, and features very good visual and sound design with a hypnotizing space ambient soundtrack. The only downside is the game's miniature size.\n\nThe core Lunar Lander style gameplay is a lot of fun - the gravity mechanics and a solid control scheme make navigating the depths of space interesting even after hundreds of successful landings. Seeing a 'PERFECT' pop up after an especially smooth descent to a planet's surface is very satisfying, expecially if you've done it with minimal fuel. The resource management is very simple, and it is very difficult to kill yourself by running out of fuel or oxygen. I'd like a little more of a challenging strategic experience on that front, but if you're not the type to get off on crushing diffculty and howling curses at the RNG, you'll probably enjoy that. Death usually comes at the hands of a Spelunky-style Rube Goldberg machine: bounce off a fast-orbiting moon into an astroid field, then ricochet into the waiting surface guns of a hostile alien world for the lose.\n\nI also think that the look and feel of the game deserves a call out - space, its denizens and its planets are all very minimal and a bit cute, along with the very well done but sometimes cartoony sound design. The music is invaluable as well, the haunting soundtrack really sets the mood for a lonely journey through deep space.\n\nMy only complaints are with the size of the game: The four available missions are slowly ramp up difficulty, adding aliens, massive asteroid belts and orbital debris around planets, but they make me long for an endless mode of some kind - after playing all four missions the only replay value really comes from playing the last mission over and over again. I'd also love an optional difficulty setting -reduce resources to an amount that encourages real conservation and risky moments.\n\nOverall a great game for $5.","December 2, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
