It had a lot of good ideas, sadly the product is crippled with flaws and bugs (and not only myrodants, the insectoid race in the game). UI is very clunky, lists are not exactly presented as list and are scroll fests (what good is an overview that show only 2 cities at a time? no troll in the game, so here they are?).\n\nWhile artwork is gorgeous, translation to 3D models is very uneven. Music is decent while SFX are pretty awkward (smells like placeholder). Visual feedback when casting spell is present, although sometimes very discreet and as there is no sound to accompany the effect... Isometrical 3D also has counter-intuitive implementations (i.e. to select a unit on a mountain, you need to click at the base of square of the mountain, cities control zone visualisation is also affected by relief and is pretty confusing). Top-down map is present, but nearly no information is there (no armies, no resources) so its like totally useless. While the game seems to be fully in 3D, there is no way to rotate the camera (neither in strategic or tactical views) while this would already solve quite a few "visibility" issues.\n\nThere are also several bugs, most of them not game breaking but still ranging from slightly to very annoying.\n\nThe game feels so unfiinished and unpolished, yet I could go over it if the features in the game did work properly. Yet they don't. For example you have resources (typically minerals like adamantine or mithril) that are supposed to provide your troops with bonuses in the town owning them if you also have an alchemy guild. Does not work (or if it does, there is absolutely no visual feedback on that, numbers stay the same, unit skills screen don't show any modifier).\n\nFor a price tag nearly matching a triple A title, so many flaws, unimplemented or buggy features, this is not acceptable. After checking the forum, the resource bug was reported at least since March 15. At the time of this review (end August 15) such a major feature still hasn't been fixed despite a dev acknowledging the feedback at the time. And that is one of an overly long list of typos, missing text, placeholders, glitches and bugs that was indeed reported. I mean, it seems no one does any QA (except the users) or track and prioritize the bugs. Many of those reported stuff is easy fix - probably as fast as answering "thanks for the report we are working on it" like they do on their steam forum, but is still not done. It feels like the company is badly managed and organized and it shows in their product, despite all the heart artists, designers and some programmers must have put into this game. It already feels like WoM is a lost cause (even if some patches rolled out since official release, most visible and major issues are not fixed) like if the code was not documented either and they are lost into it now, scared to try to fix anything without breaking much more.\n\nIt is a shame. I would advice to only buy if you are really getting tired of playing MoM on Dosbox since more than a decade and don't care about money well spent. Even then you may end up frustrated and could consider the excellent Endless Legend or Age of Wonders 3 instead. Too bad, this game really was a promising remake of MoM with nice upgrades.\n\nI reserve the right to edit or delete this negative review if Badlands actually release a patch that drastically and visibly improve WoM.","August 29, 2015","false","53.0"," 116 of 118 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","116","118","0","3"

(6 December 2015)\n\nThis game is unfinished by a grat deal. Even leaving out features annotated in the manual. While some bugs have been fixed and it is possible to complete a game after dealing with many crashes, the developers have abondened the game. They do not post to forums nor have they updated this work in months. I would recommend strongly against buying this game. You have been warned.\n\nIt should also be noted, MY GAME TIME IS NOT ACCURATE. While I have likely played over a hundred hours in total and have played enough to confidently review the game, I often neglect to close the game when walking away from my keyboard, indeed keeping it on overnite at some points. I would not mention this, but it has come up in comments.\n\nUpdated Review (13 July 2015):\n\nAt the release of version 1.2.0, the game remains unplayable. In fact, to date I have not been able to complete a single game I've begun due to catastrophic failure of the game. Some bugs can be recovered from by reloading the game, either saving/reloading or loading a prior save. In the end; however, each of my games crashed and was un-recoverable (the death bug corrupts all saves). This crash generally happens when the game just starts to get interesting (it's a slow starter), which makes things worse...\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It will only frusterate you. I had hoped to write a glimmering review of a successor to the great Master of Magic, but I think there is an evil curse associated with the game. Two would-be successors to the legacy have failed.\n\nTis sad, as this game has potential and managed to expand on some of the things that made Master of Magic great; however, it falls short in every manner and is bugged to the degree that the game still feels like a late beta after having been officially relased 16 March. That's four months! Four months and this reviewer hasn't been able to complete a game once because of a game-killing bug. Unacceptable.\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nOfficially released 19 March — as of 10 May, in my experience — the game is yet unplayable. The player is met with minimal tooltips for guidance and no tutorial, though apparently one was planned. Many of the features annotated in the manual are still not implicated. Want to experiment with the many announced negative disciplines? Well, you can't. There are only half a dozen. Want to build mithril weapons for your armies and heros? Well, you can't. Selecting mithril in the forge doesn't change the stats of your weapons.\n\nWhile developers pounded out updates during the first month of the game, fixes are becoming more elusive. If you can get past all of this, there is fun to be had. It does feel like a successor to the 1990's game Master of Magic, however, after starting several games, I have yet to be able to finish one. Not due to lack of patience, but due to deadly game-crashing bugs. I've played to around 500 turns (in some cases having never met an enemy wizard) gathering up power, hunting down nodes, and enjoying myself only to have a fatal impassable error draw the game to an end.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks off to let the developers fix the bugs, I gave it another go. The map navigation stops working around turn 5 (eg. you can't click and drag on the minimap to move around). This would be okay, but when my army pops up, it wont auto focus on it. Fine... I'll hunt them down by scrolling on the main map. I found a grey elf village on turn ten. Undefended, except a single garrisoned archer. Defeated. Crash. Main map icons pop up on the battlefield as though it were the world map and FREEZE!\n\nI can not recommend this game. DO NOT BUY IT! I know, you hope it's really good, and it ain't bad in concept. It just doesn't work and half of the cool concepts haven't been implemented. Most disappointing.\n\nCheck back for reviews over the coming months and see if the game improves, but do not buy until you hear solid reviews. This too is difficult because of general fan-dom and no doubt more difficult because the developer croudfunded, so there are many people who feel positively about the game because of their personal investment.\n\nIf the game looks interesting, I would suggest going to GoG and purchasing Master of Magic. It shows it's age, but it does work. You can start and finish a game. I hope this game get's a serious revamp by developers, because it could be so good, but seeing them back off on updates when the game is so incomplete isn't a good sign...","May 10, 2015","false","724.4"," 159 of 183 people (87%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","87","159","183","8","9"

The UI from the stone age makes the game feel like you're actually playing Masters of Magic while you're trying to move and manage your units. The sound effects in the game are comically unimpressive, especially when everything that gets hit makes the same manly grunt whether they be man, woman, beast, or being of pure magic. Worlds of Magic might eventually become a fun game, but playing the 1.0 version, I can say it is laughably unready for release.\n\nWhich is a shame really, because underneath all of these superficial yet aggressively apparent flaws is a game with mechanics that do not suck. Each of the game's factions play relatively differently. There is a large enough pool of worlds, spells, monsters, resources, and special events to give you a feeling of exploration after multiple playthroughs. Six hours into the game, I have also found it delightful to explore the strategic and tactical options the game allows you to play with.","March 19, 2015","false","32.3"," 227 of 292 people (78%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","78","227","292","7","13"

I played MoM more than just about any other game back in the day, and the thought of a real successor was a huge draw.  Unfortunately the game has never lived up to MoM, or multiple other current games in the genre for that matter.  Every build tends to introduce a new bug requiring a restart, or a new CtD.  The devs rarely respond to feedback unless it's completely positive, even going so far as calling owners stupid on the forums.  My biggest regret was that I picked it up in EA as soon as it was available and played each update to provide feedback, so I had too many hours played to get a refund when it was "released."

As so we trust that our mission is to deliver better experience and stir emotions, to create rich universes with unique solutions in reliable products for those we aim to serve.\n\nOver the past years, on our own, we have successfully delivered several titles for all kinds of players. Our products are easily accessible and available for all main gaming platforms: consoles, personal computers, mobile and VR devices. Recently we have also developed gamification projects and we are expanding in this area using our gaming experience.\nIf only I had read this prior to spending at least $40 on this title, I'd have one less piece of garbage littering my library.

GoG is a great platform with the support of many developers and publishers who are far more capable and competent.

I'm posting this as a catharsis or expurgation of my feelings of carelessness over not scrutinizing this title more carefully before buying. To complete this healing exercise, allow me to chart out the stages of Buyer's Remorse as they apply to Worlds of Magic.\n\nStage 1 - Denial. Hey, it claims to be Master of Magic rebooted with graphics that resemble the excellent Stardock title Fallen Enchantress. I don't need to look at Wastelands Interactive's other work, do I?

But not as good as I had hoped.\n\n\nThe price is intimidating first of all. But it's less than a AAA game would cost, and this game has a bit more than your average AAA game. I'm not 100% on if it's worth it or not yet.\n\n\nSecond of all, the game was forced to release while still slightly incomplete due to various contracts, which is hurting them immensely with the launch crowd. They released several patches to fix most of the issues within the first 24 hours or so, and the game is better now. Some people hate day 1 patches, so take that for what you will.\n\n\nThe game needs to be able to zoom out more, and the world map is hell to figure out sometimes. I have the graphics settings as high as they can go (They go from Fast to Good) and it's still difficult to tell exactly what tile does what, even with the little symbols pointing at them. The worst are tiles that become corrupted. I still cannot tell what tiles have this effect unless I hover over the tile specifically, and that's annoying since corrupted tiles give no bonuses. Not to mention the number of times I try to click on an army and wind up clicking the tile behind them, or whenever I accidentaly send my army to a town instead of entering the town management screen like I intended to.\n\n\nCombat is fine, though there is a wide range on damage, like 17-45 with some units. Big annoyance with flyers is that they're pretty close to the ground, so I tend to forget that they're flying a lot of the time.\n\n\nCity building is fine, though a bit slow at times. Most of your workers will be going to food and gold to support any real kind of army, and you need a few towns to do that. I suppose experts at the game will disagree though.\n\n\nI can't say much about diplomacy because I barely get a chance to use it. That's really all I can say on that, it just never comes up.\n\n\nAt this current moment, I cannot recommend this game for $40. If you see it on sale for $30 or so though, go for it, it's worth that for sure. I'll watch the updates and I might change this if things improve even more.","March 22, 2015","false","10.7"," 78 of 101 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","78","101","3","1"

WoM is instantly accessible if you know MoM.  But there have been some changes, and I think most of them are for the better.\n\nThe magic system is different but makes a lot of sense.  Spells are now part of two distinct schools, and the sum of your proficiency in those schools unlocks them.  So, say you like a particular buffing spell that's part of Biomancy and Life.  If you have enough of either, you are able to research the spell - but if you spread out your spell picks and got some of both, then the total you have will allow unlocking the spell for research.  It's a nice way to distinguish the spells within their MoM types - not all Life spells are equal, after all, so why should they all require the same prerequisites?  The infusion system in Worlds of Magic allows your combat spells to scale in power as you gain greater Spellcraft (like many of the spells in MoM did), so even those starting spells can be of great use throughout the game.\n\nCombat mechanics are handled via the d20 system, which is very easy to understand.  The numbers get a good deal bigger than the Master of Magic nimbers did (a basic High Men spearman unit can end up with almost 100 hit points at maximum level, without special buffs, for example), but the damage keeps up so battles don't slog on.  Healing feels a little weaker (except for Healing Wind, which at maximum infusion turns enormous fights against the undead into a two-turn rout), but that just means that your tactical choices are a little more important.\n\nRaces are much better balanced in Worlds of Magic than in the MoM predecessor.  If you've played MoM, you know that Paladins = Instawin.  All races have the ability to dominate, in WoM; the Grey Elves, for example, have probably the most powerful starting unit in the game (Archers), but even an army full of levelled archers can be managed.  Similarly, an army of Paladins in WoM will be powerful, for sure, but not unstoppable - especially if you have an opposing army of similarly powerful units (orcish Manslayers; Elven Faradrax; Draconian Elders, etc).\n\nThe economy in WoM is very familiar to anyone who played MoM - with one notable exception.  The undead have been worked to have a different, simplified economy.  This is an interesting option, because it completely changes the feel of the game.  With undead being unable to invade and keep the cities of the living (they are the enemies of all life, after all), playing as the Unhallowed (WoM name for undead) turns you unto a rolling tide of death, and makes the whole expansion part of the game feel faster and inexorable.\n\nFinally, Worlds of Magic takes the Arcanum/Myrror plane aspect of Master of Magic and makes it much more detailed, and much more meaningful.  Now, you have the Prime plane, as well as planes of Earth, Water, Air, Fire, and Shadow.  Each plane offers special strategic benefits in the form of city resources, and thus plays into the strengths of specific races.  Unhallowed start in the plane of Shadow and draw strength from the negative energy sources all around; dwarves will become production powerhouses in the plane of earth, cranking out high-cost units every other turn or earning ridiculous amounts of gold when making Trade Goods.  Because there are so many planes, it is possible to take shortcuts across the map via planar travel.  Can't get across the sea?  Maybe there's a gateway to another place on the coast - go through it, and if you can traverse the land of that plane, you can find another gateway back to your starting plane, and cross the sea (by way of one or more planes) without ever getting wet or building a ship!  The mutiplane design is quite rewarding, and offers a great deal of replay value, since you can choose how many planes to allow in the game world, their size, how much of each is land, and the general configuration of that land (islands, continents, one giant landmass).\n\nLike Master of Magic, on release there are a few things that still need fixed.  There are some bugs, and the on-screen error reporter will tell you exactly what they are, so you can report them in detail and hopefully help get them fixed quickly.  This isn't a flawless game, but it's a shot of nostalgia for anyone who loves Master of Magic and wished someone would make a proper sequel.  Get it; you won't regret the purchase.","March 19, 2015","true","259.4"," 143 of 204 people (70%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","70","143","204","9","6"

Five minutes after starting a new game, I'm in the  first battle on the tactical map.  I win.  The game freezes in a way I have never seen before, with parts of the strategic map on top of the tactical map.  I reload the game and fight the battle on auto.

I'd been looking for a game that made a decent attempt at building on MoM's legacy for a while so I was pretty excited to hear about this one. However this game is less about building on MoM's legacy and more about porting it wholesale.\n\nThe good:\n- most things that made MoM good are still in there i.e. lots of customisation, reasonably interesting fantasy setting, casting spells.\n\nThe bad:\n- doesn't support 1280*1024 resolution!\n- the map and units quite ugly. The game world in particularly is quite poor at communicating information eg. resources and dungeons are not easy to make out.\n- interfaces are neither pretty nor particularly functional\n- doesn't let you skip movement animations on the combat map\n- maps have 6 subdimensions for no reason, which is unnecessarily confusing. 2 is plenty.\n- basically nothing significant has changed since MoM. So city building and expansion are about as bland as you'd expect from a strategy game made in 1994.\n\nWhen I saw this game, I was hoping that it would retain the features that made Master of Magic a really interesting game and combine them with a solid 4X core that built on the advances of the last couple of decades. At the very least, I'd have expected MoM with a slick interface and nice graphics.\nThis game delivers none of that. Its interface fails to make any notable improvement on MoM's neanderthal counterpart - and in fact lacks the aesthetic charm of the older game. The underlying problem of Worlds of Magic is that in their quest to preserve every mechanic the developers have not added or changed anything substantial but have still managed to lose plenty. If you run the two games next to one another, you will see they play in the same sort of way - but one lacks charm, and a soul.","May 11, 2015","false","5.9"," 54 of 66 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","54","66","2","13"

And so when I saw this attempt at a remake, I was immediately intrigued.\n\nBut despite joining early in early access, I've played (and enjoyed) it relatively little. At first, the game was crippled with bugs in the simple things like movement and UI that would frequently make it close to unplayable. While the worst of those seem resolved now, the experience this game delivers mostly makes me want to go load DOSBox to play MoM instead. The game has some promise, but there's a lot that needs to be seriously fixed before this goes to official release. Some various thoughts:\n\nUI - The UI feels as awkward as something from the 90s era the game is trying to emulate, and maybe less precise.  Often trying to click on UI elements results in map clicks that send your units running weird places. This also happens when trying to select units or targets. The Save/Load interface also seems rather clunky, the buttons often requiring extra clicks, crude organization (why icons over a nice list?), etc. Really, this is the biggest knock against the game, it just seems so unpolished, unprofessional. In this state, I think it's really dubious that they're even asking people money for it.\n\nGraphics - The graphics are about Civ 4 level, so while it's an update, they're not really modern.  This isn't a huge deal, but I feel like they could have done better (other independent strategy games have managed clean modern looks without super system requirements, like Banner Saga).\n\nTactical Gameplay - There are a lot of balance issues here. I don't know why the ONE thing this game didn't copy from MoM is the combat system, using a D&D-style one instad. By comparison, the system (with hits/misses/crits, damage rolls, etc) seems to be much less predictable than MoM's. Swordsmen attack Swordsmen. 8 damage. Counterattack. 32 damage! Just seems crappy and random. Ranged units are also super overpowered and dominant. Infinite range, no counters and scoot n' shoot makes them worth basically 2x a same tier melee unit (or worth 10x if you're fighting something stronger, where counterattacks will chew up melee).\n\nStrategic Gameplay  - Everything you'd expect of a normal 4x/Civ clone here, although I think things are tuned way too slow and way too tight. For instance, you start getting unrest the very first time your city grows - seriously?  It always feels like you're broke and on the verge of starvation, and makes some Sorcerer traits & spells (Merchant, the city buffs) almost mandatory.\n\nCustomization & Variety - Needs more races, but the ones they have seem nicely varied (if not balanced). The Sorcerer traits are similar to MoM, although some feel like they have little impact, while others seem near mandatory (Merchant again). I'm not sure about the spell list design, although I dislike how summons seem to be organized into their own sphere rather than present across all of them as they were in MoM, meaning less people have access to them. MoM saw War Bears, Sprites, Hell Hounds, Phantom Warriors, Guardian Spirits and various undead used early and often. That seems less the case now, with many possible builds getting no summons at all.\n\nAI - As far as I can tell, the AI options are 'Do Nothing' and 'Everyone sends all their units to attack you and only you.' Definitely needs some improvement here.","February 13, 2015","false","21.7"," 101 of 145 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","101","145","3","7"

With 50+ independent cities all taking seperate turns the loading between your turns becomes unforgiveable. You are also locked out of looking at your cities and your magic research/crafting/casting etc during these loading phases. At the start when your trying to build up your capitals economy you could spend an hour or two not actively playing while waiting for your building que to finish and the tedium of the free cities to taking their turns (typically swarming you with one or two units at a time) so you need to actively defend your capital at all times instead of giving you leeway to scout etc.\n\nAs others have noted crashing is an issue and many tooltips are missing but that is typical early access issues.\n\nThe magic system also appears lacking. The spells are lackluster, nothing new and exciting to see here in terms of magic. Most of the magic is geared towards buffs or debuffs either in combat, persistant or for cities. The penalties with magic also seem high to the point that its probably not really worth bothering with. There is only 3 tiers of spells the final teir spells are hardly noteworthy, the humble web and fireball spells are actually tier three final spells. Magic costs increases the further you are away from your capital and you have a limited amount of mana you can use per turn (but you can increase your capacity).\n\nCombat also appears very boring. I don't think there is tactical deployment and the obsticles are mere sprinkles and not even a factor tactically. There would need to be some sort of environmental elements going on like hills swamps rivers etc which provide benefits/pentalties instead of a flat chess board with some spaces unusable. Also im not sure if you can get units to defend or get bonuses from tactics like flanking or backstabbing etc. The only thing I noticed was a penalty with retreating or trying to use range when a target is right next to the unit.\n\nThe only notable aspect of the game is the mangement of resources which may result in more micromanging and tedium. If you want to build up a large mana supply you can forgo research and your mana capactity development. Same with the population control in cities, you can tailor to more food (base neccessity) or direct citizens into production or research. I'm not sure if excess production is carried over though so in theory you could tediously micromange and shift production to research right before a building completes to not waste potential.\n\nAlthough this is early access I am sceptical about the direction of the game. Independent cities need simultanious turns at the very least (consider them full players without the ability to build settlers) as a 7 world very large map you would be wasting hours upon hours waiting for these independents to have their turns one at a time. (With three worlds there was about 50-55 independents, so over seven worlds look forward to 120+). Hopefully there are plans for several more teirs of magic and much needed updates to combat gameplay.","September 13, 2014","false","11.4"," 133 of 197 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","133","197","4","9"

(Hint to the developers: do publish a small demo version)\n\nIt was worth it.\n\nThe game is... well, it's MoM with modern graphics and without the need for dosbox. There are some gameplay improvements but that's it.\nI was hoping it was the case, and I was not disappointed in the least. I don't want a fancy reinterpretation, I want Master of Magic. This is it.\n\n\nActual gameplay review/playthrough(Assumes knowledge of Master of Magic)\n\nWhy is there no ominous wizard tower on the start screen? No matter, let's start a new game.\nFour planes available, with both continent style and amount of water on separate settings for each.\n\nA lot of races in already, High Men are pretty much identical to how they were, elves too. (Orcs are more like lizardmen, the undead are a mirrored high men, like orcs were in the first one)... oh, wait, draconians... doom drakes? Ok, race chosen.\nThey're pretty much the same too. A bit more difficult economically maybe.\n\nThe standard archmages are Merlin, Ariel, Freya, Ssra, Jafar and Rjak plus two new additions. sure they are not actually names the same. Wait, Rjak is.\n\nMagic is pretty much the same, sorcery was split into water and air, nature becames earth, chaos becames fire. Death and life are the same.\nThere are also thematic paths like summoning or protection, but at the moment they appear to be a bit contrived. They use the same spell of the elemental ones, but picking them by theme. I'll stick with elements for now.\n\n\nThe gameplay is the same. And that's exactly what I was looking for. No need for instruction if you know the game already. You just need to spend a bit of time finding stuff you know is there.\n\n\nflaws that might already be fixed by the time you read this\n- no good way to understand where mana is going, the enchantment screen does not cut it (besides there's no way to tell which unit or city has which enchantment).\n- very poor strategic world map, after Fallen Enchantress I'm used to way better at max zoom out. A note-taking feature would be appreciated too, or at least the possibility to name a location.\n- not enough tooltips. you got some hovering on icons in the city interface, why not on the city list as well?\n- poor information inside cities. there's a total produced per building/features/population, but no way to tell, e.g. which feature is giving you a bonus or where is it on the map. Same for research bonuses.\n- an internal encyclopedia is sorely needed, at the very least I should know the statistics of the unit I am going to build, without building them first.

It's not what you're looking for. We all loved MoM and we all tried our best to recapture the feel of that game by trying out all the clones; from the AoW series, Endless Legend, King Arthur you name it. None of them captured the true essence of MoM and neither does this. Had it come out 5-10 years ago, I might have accepted some of flaws of this title, but nowhere does it look and feel like a 2015 title. It's as if the developers played MoM and AoW3 and nothing else. Nothing seems to have been learned from the abundance of 4X titles that have hit the market over the last 2 decades.\n\nPros:\n-The strategic overview looks good.\n-The game mentions MoM several times bringing fond memories back.\n\nCons:\n-The sound... Argh. My Ears. It's like some sort of medieval torture.\n-The city screen is a mess. A huge graphic of the city? Why? I want a list with all the information so I don't have to memorize the looks of each race's buildings and their stats.\n-The build queue will drive you insane. I don't care about your huge MS Paint illustrations I want INFORMATION!?!?\n-The insanely slow build-up. While in 1994 it was "fun" to spend 100 turns to build up, today's 4X games actually give you something to do from the get go. This game seems to live in 1994.\n-The tactical overview is bland to put it mildly. The same broken tree and mini-volcano in the same spots every time.\n-Tactical Auto-resolve*. I had a very easy encounter kill my entire army on auto, on manual the enemy didn't even reach my army before my ranged units had killed every single of their units (even without using magic).\n-Tactical combat is extremely easy. Create a barrier of impassable terrain. Kill flyers/ranged units. Pretend it's a shooting gallery.\n-The controls are nonresponsive. Sometimes casting a spell require 1 click, other times the same spell require 7 clicks.\n\nI could go on listing annoying little things that in themselves wouldn't be gamebreaking, but when you add it all together and the only redeeming factor is a pretty strategic overview it just doesn't float.\n\n\n*Sure, you shouldn't ever use auto-resolve, but the tactical combat is so boring even after half an hour you'll wish you could skip it.","June 16, 2015","false","2.7"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","26","30","0","1"

The game play is what I’ve been wanting out of game like this: brutal punishment for stupid mistakes, in-depth options on a battleboard, a robust spell system, and unique immersive fantasy factions.    This game has done what the other Master of Magic descendants failed to do, IMO, and that is create a game that gives you the freedom to run a fantasy empire the way you want, learn through hard work and exploration, and finally engage your mind in tactical combat.\n\nThe best part of doing all the testing was how responsive the dev team has been.  I’ve written pages and pages of suggestions and feature requests.  All of them were acknowledged and most have made it in the game.  I know that the community that supported this game from PayPal and Kickstarter campaigns designed most of the spells, factions, world features, heroes, titans, sorcerer-lords, and units in this game.

The graphics in Worlds of Magic looks nice, but not the most brilliant and cutting edge.

The game right now is designed for people who have been playing the alpha and beta versions previously.\n\nThere is very little tutorial. You need to read online how to play the game, what things mean, etc. You'll also be looking to forums to ask what a part of the HUD does because they're not explained/no tool tip.\nAs well people like me who wanted to wait until the final release to start playing and who kickstarted got delayed a day behind people who could buy in the launch day via steam. This to me is a lack of respect for their backers.\nThese things make me think the developers might have been too involved with the back and forth with the players to realize new players won't have figured everything out due to not playing in the alphas and betas.\n\nI'm already frustrated with the game due to figuring out how to play. Or little things like remembering you have to press enter after you put in your save game name and then after that click save, same for naming your sorceror sans clicking to save. Or not being able to set the game to automatically select the next unit with remaining moves. Or place holders for spell/unit/icon descriptions.\n\nThere are good aspects to the game and it does seem to be acheived being a 'spiritual successor' to Master of Magic.

If you have never played MoM, and you like 4X games, I highly recommend you purchase it -- nowadays you can get it really cheap from Gog.com.  If you like it, you'll want to buy "Worlds of Magic".\n\nWoM is an incredibly rich game, with tons of monsters and spells, and special locations to loot and exploit.  It includes hundreds of spells, item crafting, heroes, 7 separate planes you can explore, the abillity to customize your game to last an hour or so, or to potentially last weeks, if you are so inclined.  I'm not 100% sure, but I suspect that with everything implemented, it's potentially the largest non-space-based 4X game there is.   And there are so many different ways of playing the game, so many different ways of customizing your world and your wizard, so that no 2 games would ever feel the same.\n\nA whole lot of the game is customizable, from the design of the worlds you are playing in (I say Worlds because the universe is divided up into a number of planes, any of which you can choose to include or exclude from your game, and all of which have important differences, special resources to be exploited, and so on).  You can design your wizard or pick from a number of premade ones.  You can select your starting spells, based on what spell circles you've chosen, or you can simply randomize the selection.\n\nFor people who are unfamiliar with "Master of Magic", The best way of describing this game is that it's a Fantasy game with an emphasis on spell casting.  The meat and potatoes of most combats will be magic.  Yes, units are important, but you'll want to enchant those units.  Some of the best units in the game will have to be summoned by you.  Heroes will join your cause, and you'll be able to level them up and select more skills for them.  You'll be able to equip them with gear that you've either crafted or found or purchased, or received through diplomacy with other sorceror lords.  Equip a hero well enough, and level him up, and cast powerful enchantments on him and he can become practically an army of one.\n\nThe AI in the game has been rapidly improving.  As always, with complex 4X strategy games, the AI does cheat.  Let's put it this way:  Writing a decent AI is so hard, that when someone actually does it, it makes the news (google "Poker AI" if you don't believe me).  So the game does cheat in order to give the player an interesting game.  That said, there have been numerous improvements prior to launch, and even improvements in the 2 days post-launch.  And as the AI improves, there will be less and less cheating.  Currently, the different Sorceror Lords have different personalities and preferences regarding expansion and agression and so on.  But now they can be very agressive both militarily and expansion-wise.\n\nThere are certainly some spells that aren't working right,  Diplomacy is weak currently, but it does work (to an extent).  And it has improved rapidly as well.  Right now, my opinion is that Diplomacy is the weakest aspect of the game, but it is getting better.\n\nThe UI has made drastic improvements, even in the past 2 days.  And more changes are coming.  It is now to the point that I consider it 'good' though not great.  The camera is the weekest aspect now, but it is 'ok'\n\nThe Devs have also added switches to the game so that you can further customize your map design, including selecting how many special locations there are.  Still to come, I expect them to add a slider to customize random events.  During the beta, people (including me) complained because random events were too common (especially some really bad ones).  Since launch, it's gone in the totally opposite direction.  Now random events are very rare.\n\nMy biggest reason for supporting this game is that the devs have been great.  All during Early Access, they've communicated with us constantly, they've listened to our feedback, and responded quite often with actual changes.  Instead of slowing down with their updates after launch, they actually sped up, fixing problems that snuck in at the last minute.  So it was a somewhat rocky launch, but because of how consistently the Devs have followed through beyond what most dev teams do,  I feel that this game will become a 4X classic.","November 22, 2014","true","573.6"," 59 of 92 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","59","92","4","1"

After some reflection, I opted for a “Yes” since the amount of fun I had in 15 hours of play did outweigh if only by a narrow margin the frustration.\n\nOn the up side, I’m really glad someone finally made a serious attempt to update Simtex’s wonderful 1994 game, Master of Magic. On the down side, I wish they hadn’t done it so scrupulously as to imitate the bugginess that came with the original MoM release back in ’94. It was a hair-pulling disaster 21 years ago until the version 1.3 patch. A bad game with bugs puts you out of its misery pretty quickly as you move on. A good game with freezes, crashes and aggravations like roll-over pop-ups that only work sometimes is a torment that’s hard to escape.\n\nOther reviewers have already accurately detailed both the good and the bad of this game. Based on the reviews, I held off buying until there was a price reduction. I hoped most of the negative stuff would turn out to be idiosyncratic and related either to the reviewer’s temperament or their rig. Mostly it’s not. But the good stuff is also there. It’s got enough of the MoM ethos to please devotees of the Simtex masterpiece. Even a non-MoM fantasy-based 4X fan will find much to like.  I’ve played lots of Age of Wonders III, Fallen Enchantress, Endless Legend and Warlock.  World of Magic is in their league albeit dragged to the bottom of the table by its flaws.\n\nIf the devs ever debug it, this game will be a first-class fantasy-based 4X game. Even in its current state there’s lots of fun to be had especially for fans of MoM as long as you can handle things like a game freezing just as you win a titanic battle on the tactical map or losing a saved game that you’ve invested considerable time into without needing to down some Xanax.\n","May 29, 2015","true","73.1"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","28","38","3","4"

Wizard selection/creation gave me hope, there were traits and various schools of magic to fiddle with. The mixed school selection was a nice touch. You can choose to go deep in fire, for example, and you pick up all sorts of fire-related spells from different disciplines. Or you could be a specialist in the summoning discipline that gets access to a variety of summons from the different elements. Planes? Not just Myrror here, but fire, water, shadow, and many more. Maybe too many if you enabled them all, but I liked the option.\n\nGraphics are poor for a current release, especially on the city screen and world map. The world map in particular is a complete mess. Is that plot grassland, swamp, or something else? Couldn't tell you just by looking. Mountains have a strange, flat-topped appearance. Does terrain even matter? In addition to the low graphics quality, the city screen is non-intuitive, some areas you think should be clickable aren't, and some areas you must click are not in the place I would have thought.\n\nThe interface needs a lot of work. Strange combinations of right and left click options left me sometimes moving units across the map when I wanted to just select a stack. The menu on the lower right could be better explained. I didn't get a good feel for tactical combat since I rarely had opportunities for conflict in the games I played. The choice of some form of the d20 system seems tacked on and irrelevant.\n\nSounds are adequate. Nothing stood out, but I didn't have and jarring, out of place sounds either.\n\nAs an early access backer, I didn't really feel that feedback was acted on. I saw very little difference between the early access builds and the released product. The feeling I got was of an operation running out of time and/or money and shipping an incomplete product, unfortunately not an uncommon story these days.

I loved MoM and played it for years and could even win on impossible with my level 4 slingers. This game has promise BUT they need to allow auto combat once you're in manual combat. The A.I. is too weak to play for you and once you jump in on manual and cast a few spells and shoot a few arrows, you need to be able to move on quickly and you can't. This needs to be solved if you want to keep people playing. The graphics are a little weak for the price but there are a lot of micro elements that will allow for continued enjoyable play for a long long time.

It is quite similar to MOM, but it has some major differences.\n\n1. The spell book selection is way different, you will have to look at the wiki or the game to see how. This influences how spells are ranked and obtained.\n2. There are currenly 4 planes instead of 2.\n3. Making artifacts is now seperate from casting overland spells, therefore you can do both at the same time.\n4. They have made the units attributes more complicated than they previously were. This is something I don't like. Perhaps MOM oversimplified the display of the unit attributes (hit points, strength, etc...), but the current display is too damn comlex.\n\nThere are lots of minor differences of course, but these are the big three in my opinion. Otherwise, the mechanics, units, spells, wizards, cities, races, units, etc are very similar.\n\n\nAs far as the present version goes, it is pretty fun. It's prerelease so expect bugginess.

Lo and behold I found this kickstarter and saw that it was being offered on Steam. I headed over, took a look and bought the game on the spot. I've now played it for around a hundred hours and I'm addicted. This game really is the true successor, unabashedly so, to MoM. In almost every way that I can see so far they have improved upon the original and made it the game it could have been (granted MoM was a long time ago so they've definitely used the improved capabilities to great advantage).\n\nSo how does it compare to Mom?\nWell, it outshines the original and it's still, as of this writing, probably four months away from release. The graphics are better, the map is larger, the spell tree is larger and more flexible, you can have more than 9 units stacked now (I've had as many as 19 units) and the battles can be huge. You can also have more one plane or more than one plane (up to four or five currently, can't remember off the top of my head) which you can choose. All in all they took the spirit of MoM and added to it.\n\nAs this is an early review there are still things to add and I don't think the end game is in there yet so I can't comment on it (i.e. I don't know if the only way to win is to beat all of the other sourcerers through conquest or cast a "Spell of Majesty" which isn't in the game - yet).\n\nAre there areas where it doesn't stack up? In two words - unqualified NO.\n\nMost of the information about the game can be gleaned from the wiki page that Wastelands Interactive set up for it (which can be found here: http://wastelands-interactive.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Main_Page).\n\nThe development team is the most responsive I've ever seen in a pre-release scenario. I noted on the discussion boards just last week that I found a showstopping bug in a new release, reported it to the devs with a save game and a new patch was released five hours later - on a friday of all things.\n\nPerformance improvements continue to be made every week it seems. When I first started, playing with two planes and three opponents took forever for each move (i.e. go get coffee and come back even at the beginning). The last game that I played (yesterday), well, I got to move 1,066 in the same scenario and it only took me about six hours in total. I expect the game to get faster still.\n\nBoats still aren't in the current version so you need the water walking or flight spell to get over water so I can't review that.\n\nThe simplest way to say this is that if you liked MoM, you'll love WoM. It's an addicting game and being that you can save every turn and shut down it makes for a great time filler. If you haven't bought it yet, do it. Wastelands Interactive is doing it right.\n","November 23, 2014","true","375.7"," 32 of 50 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","32","50","2","0"

I really wanted the game to be good but I can't recommend it.  I will do a longer write up why later but sadly I can't recommend Worlds of Magic.  I am a big 4X game and of the current batch of 4X games to come out in the last couple of years I would put WoM at the bottom, even below the updated Eador.  Sorry to do that, wish I had better things to say but WoM might try to be the successor to MoM but it fails in my opinion.  I hate to say this but $40 for the game is a joke.  $20 I could understand.  Even for 4X lovers I would say hold off for a 50% sale, and even then you have to be a game collector such as myself to really justify it.","March 23, 2015","false","8.0"," 38 of 61 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","38","61","0","3"

As a kickstarter backer myself you can see all of posts at http://forum.wastelands-interactive.com/forumdisplay.php?374-Worlds-of-Magic\n\nAs to the game. If you enjoyed Master of Magic, you will enjoy Worlds of Magic, because as of right now that is what it is with improved graphics. The developers have been very faithful to the original idea of Master of Magic and have improved on some of the less desired options from the old game.\n\nAs the early access release however the AI isn't fully fleshed out but remember AI is extremely hard to make in 4x games so give it time there.\n\nThe graphics are nice and all the units have a personality all their own. There are races to fit your type of play, you want to be a human its there, a raging orc, a horde of undead, a noble elf, and even a swarming insect hive. All of that will be in the game, as well as more on release.\n\nThe crafting system is easy and satisfying to use for units, and the planes of magic feel pretty nice as well.\n\nSo should you buy early access?\n\nIf you want to support and play through some rough patches the answer is simply yes. If you want to wait for a complete product just click, add to your wishlist and put it off till then.\n","September 11, 2014","true","5.8"," 27 of 41 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","27","41","0","1"

And it is already a blast to play so far.\n\nIf you are a fan of 4x games, age of wonders series, civ games or the like, take the time to read up and seriously consider getting this game soon, either to play it or just put it on the backburner while offering Wastelands Interactive some early support.\n\nIf you are looking for a multiplayer version of MoM... Then, well, wait a bit (unless hotseat is acceptable to you). Actually I'm STILL going to say buy it now and just put it on the backburner... Despite many crestfallen moments of failed and derailed early access games, I have high hopes and real faith this game will reach its goals. If you want it, support it!\n\n[/tl;dr version]\n\nOK, my game time has been severely curtailed recently, but I couldn't resist getting World of Magic... MoM was and is one of my all time favorite games. As a matter of fact, I purchased MoM off Good old Games, and it is installed on all my computers, all the time, even if I only go through a scenario every month or three. Nobody really wants to think of themselves as a fanboy, but when it comes to myself and MoM, I wonder sometimes...\n\nDespite my little time playing, I've played quite a few games -mostly right now just custom creation, consolidation and "turn, turn, turn" to see progressions, spell loadouts, and familiarizing myself with the races... (Protip: change autosave option to a timed autosave instead of X number of turns if you like to spam the turn button on occasion)\n\nSo, how does World of Magic stack up in comparison? Well, that is the subject of just about every review on here, so I'll just leave it at "YES!"  "Yay!" and "Finally!" Even at this early, incomplete stage I'm feeling the draw and asking myself why I'm using my limited time writing this review instead of playing the game :) - I absolutely cannot wait for multiplayer; its all over after that.\n\nDespite the generally bad form of including a GOTO statement, well, anywhere, I most adamantly second En_Ma's review and comments- especially the advice to offer a small demo version, though as pretty much all these reviews seem to imply, you could almost consider Master of Magic a litmus for how you'll feel about World of Magic.\n\nSome specific things which deserve mention, even if some are repetition:\n+many Myrrors? awesome! each unique and "myrroring" spheres of magic, this promises some seriously epic games -though perhaps wait until the odds of a save-breaking update lessen before embarking. But thats OK, because you can enable or disable each or all as you desire. Surely, multiplayer will NEED a save and continue later feature!\n\n+already a diverse and interesting set of spells. Example: Earth's Embrace, which offers defense bonus but immobilizes your unit. Also, obviously, a lot of the classics -including one of my favorites: Chaos Channels (though it isn't called that anymore)\n\n+an already enjoyable list of mundane and summoned units. I hope to see the list grow a lot\n\n+++many other positives repeated too many times for my lazy butt to bother with.\n\n- despite the lush and beautiful main map, it feels crowded to me (protip: 'n' sets the view to overhead. Much better, and more MoM-like!)\n\n- battle map is still somewhat annoyingly limited (definitely avoid battles taking place in your walled cities unless you like hide and seek with half your army "Where's the 'Ollie Ollie in come free' spell?!")\n\n- Of course, unfinished... heroes have no unique portraits yet, tooltips and information is lacking in many places, etc.\n\n+/- Every game I've played so far, neutral armies (some rather robust) wander aimlessly around my cities, growing in numbers until some kind of MERSA message shoots across their collective AI brains and they all descend more or less simultaneously -I've had consecutive battles sometimes almost twenty turns in a row with them flooding in even out of the shroud of war during these little mini adventures. This has varied from fun to depressing to downright comical, but I'm not sure if that is appropriate behavior for independent factions, haha. And to be fair, this could be partly the result of my current, somewhat consistent, turtling and rapid turn playstyle.\n\nAll told, I am a very happy gamer... If you read all this, thanks for taking the time, and I hope I helped you decide to get this game!","December 31, 2014","true","23.1"," 47 of 78 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","47","78","4","1"

There are placeholders for text, and for art.  Dwarf heroes that look like humans, elf heroes that look like humans, orc heroes that look like humans.  Not to say there aren't ANY unique hero arts, there are some already done and they look fine.\n\nAdamantine doesn't work.  You build an alchemist guild and you don't get any benefit from it unit creation wise in that city.  Meanwhile, it does now show up as a material you can use when forging equipment, but there's nothing special about using it over iron right now either.  On the subject of forging it works just fine you can make magic gear for your heroes.  The cost of adding enchantments is exponential though, which can lead to insane costs.  I also don't find most of the current enchantment options for gear that impressive, which compounds the exponential cost aspect.\n\nMost spells seem to work fine.  Some spells don't seem to work at all.  I used word of recall to return a hero to my summoning circle and then he was invisible on the map screen, I gave him an order to fight an enemy army.  He fought that army, battle played just fine and he was visible in that battle, then back on the main screen he was gone completely.  Not just invisible, gone from my unit roster.  I still had his gear but couldn't put it on anyone else as if it was still being worn.  Many spells are missing descriptions of what they actually do.  "Gives a unit armsmaster" for example, doesn't really tell you what armsmaster does.  (It gives +50 experience a turn to all units in the tile discluding the unit who has it).  Levitate doesn't seem to let units cross water.  Planar travel doesn't let a unit move between planes, or if it does I couldn't find the way to do it via the UI.\n\nTactical combat is slow, partly due to the revision of MoM system of fighting.  In MoM if two units fought they hit each other at the same time and figures died at that same time.  In this game for clarity's sake a guy swings, damage numbers pop up or it says miss, then the other guys get hit or dodge.  In MoM you saw no damage numbers, so it could be hard to tell what happened at times but at least it was FAST.  At the very least this game could use "Very Fast unit animations" or the ability to turn them off all together.  Auto resolve works about as well as it does in most games.  Sometimes you lose guys you wouldn't fighting it out, but then that's to be expected.\n\nOn the subject of the UI I think it's fine, a lot of people are bashing the game over that, I am much more upset at the amount of place holder stuff and general incompleteness, adamantine in particular not working really upsets me.  The UI is very usable, although I will say for battles I often adjust the camera at the start of the fight so I can see and click on everything because the default camera position isn't zoomed out enough nor tilted well.  City wise the UI is just fine, although displays glitchy if you put a lot of stuff in the que.  The UI does a great job with the end turn button however, it willl always let you know about armies you have yet to move or tell to fortify, research a new spell if you forgot, and make sure your cities are building.  Clicking the end turn button when any of these things aren't ready immediately takes you to whatever you need to take care of, and before you click it the end turn button displays a graphic corresponding to what hasn't been handled.\n\nAll that said the game is in a far better state already than Elemental was at it's release, and if they fix the broken stuff and fill in the placeholders this will be a great game.  I can actually say that the game is fun for me right now, although I have not personally had it crash on me more than once in my 28 hours of play so far.  I can't recommend it over Endless Legends as of this moment, however, I still think even in it's current state this game is playable and fun.","March 21, 2015","true","35.7"," 29 of 45 people (64%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","64","29","45","6","0"

Funny that its not even finished yet, but still has a highly addictive oldschool quality to it so rare in todays games. The massive variety of races, monsters, spells, and even multple dimensions to conquer and rule is hardcore. This is what many of us retro gamers have been waiting to see.\nthe\nIt does justice to the original Masters of Magic, while adding wastland's own touch. I was a bit skeptical, albeit hopeful, when I bought the early access. Mainly because so many other spiritual successors have been a big disappointment. But Worlds of Magic gives the same deeply immersing experiance that the original had. Its still a little laggy for me, still needs some tweaks here and there (like unique sprites for the heros) and I know all the races wont make it in from the original, but I am very much hoping that at least the Beastmen, Dark Elves, and Troll armies make the cut, and the rest are mixxed in with the playable races. But even as an unfinished beta, this game is already the type of game that will be a cult classic.\n\nIts also very cool that troops and heroes can level up, gain perks, and you can even craft magic items for your generals. The AI is acceptable. They will harrass your borders, invade en mass, and retreat when they are in trouble.\n\nI am always anxious for each new update, because if the beta is this good, the finished game will be a masterpiece.\n\nIf you likes Fallen Enchantress, Civilization, Age of Wonders, or oldschool games like the original Master of Magic, youll fall in love with this gem.","January 4, 2015","true","300.7"," 32 of 51 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","32","51","3","0"

I backed the game in the kickstarter stages, and with my fellow community members have helped shape the game to what we have currently today. The developers, have listened and implemented great swathes of content, based on backer feedback, while staying as true, as possible to MOM. The developers are IMHO second to none, and as a KS backer of countless projects, I can only say that they are by far the best Ive had the pleasure to deal with.\n\nThe game currently has 4 of the 8 races, that are going to be implemented in the initial game release. I think over 200+ spells, of both battle use, and world map use. The final number of spells I believe will be 400+. The game has bugs, of that there is no doubt, but hey this is a beta?.

The game hung in combat after the AI cast some spell and then I couldn't end my turn, or click the unit or menu buttons. Apparently the AI cast a spell which caused all the buttons of the itnerface to stop working!\n\nTLD: Too many bugs..., I am not getting paid to debug a supposedly complete game.\n\n\n*****\n7 hours played, version 1.2.6, Linux\n\n7 hour Overall: Undecided. The graphics are pretty and the game has tremendous variety, complexity, and depth. But the AI and user interface need polish.\n\n******\n3 hours playing: it was interesting with pretty graphics and intriguing strategic elements.\nWorlds of Magic is entertainig with strategic elements (portals, settlers, city development) similar to CaveWars and Age of Wonders III. The ability of units to stack on the strategic map makes tactical combat similar to the Heroes of Might & Magic series. So far the difficulty is on the easy side, but with only 3 hours I have yet to encounter anything besides neutral enemy armies.\n\nPros: Graphics are nice, animations smooth, MANY different player options. the magic system has great depth and adds strategic complexities. Solid gameplay and user interface.\n\nCons: A few minor bugs found; lacking campaign/story/quests/scenarios for single player. The high complexity probably makes the game unbalanced in some-way, although I haven't found anything yet which is clearly overpowered.\n\n\n******\n7 hours playing: So many tedioiusly easy battles with roaming neutral armies. The animations and user interface now seem too slow because I now know exactly what I want my units to be doing. [This game needs to shorten the animations, or allow issuing orders to groups of multiple units at the same time: E.g. tell all archers to shoot at a group of three selected enemies.]\n\nAlso it is starting to get annoying trying to figure out where they are coming from. It is difficult to track enemy movements across the map because neutral enemy armies are grey and blend into the map. If you aren't looking directly at an enemey during the enemy turn you can't see what has moved where. There is a button to alert you to spotted enemies, but after you click it once you can't cycle back to it.\n\nSpeaking of the map, there is no indication of the difficult of the random dungeons across the map without clicking on them individually. This could be fixed by indicating on the map the level of the highest level monster that might be there. It is tedious to click on all of them to determine which ones are too hard, and which are possible to defeat with your current armies.\n\nThere doesn't appear to be any way to zoom in or out without a mouse-wheel. The options don't appear to have the option to set an alternate key-binding for this important feature.\n\nAI errors/exploits have become prominent. For example, teleporting unicorn riders next to enemy archers, and then enemy melee units next to the enemy archers choose to abandon the archers to their doom and move towards my other units (archers, druids, etc.) instead of attacking my unicorn riders right next to them and the enemy archers.\n\nThe developers clearly focused a lot of time into the rich diversity of units, unit attributes, and spells but some parts are lacking polish. Sometimes powerful random events appear without warning (e.g. fire drakes spawning near your first town). If something so drastic is about to occur there should be some kind of lead-up before hand that might hint that something is about ot happen, or some explanation of 'why' it happened.\n\nMinor Bugs: Tutorial blocks access to the menu so you can't skip to next tutorial if/whenever you want to.\nGame stuck in tactical combat when last enemy(Archangel) died on enemy turn via acid arrow effect. Unit stack death animation played but red square stayed, victory screen didn't come up, and it stayed stuck on enemy turn.","December 3, 2015","false","15.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

You are walking a tight rope trying to balance the cost of your army, and grow your nations.\n\nMoM also enabled you to grow super troops.  These Heroes could quickly change the entire make up of your army.  With the right support these troops could be built up to almost single handedly challenge an army.   The game also gave you the ability to set the amount of land size every time you started the game.  So one game you are fighting a land war the next you are island hopping.\n\nNow let’s roll into the fact that your leader is a master magician, able to summon Sky Dragons, call forth floating Islands, or summon the undead.  MoM included six different schools of magic, and a dozen special feats that you can assign your wizard.\nBut wait there is more…  Mom also gave you the opportunity to change the race (species) across half a dozen choices.  Men, elves, dwarves, halflings, nomads, dwarves, orcs, dark elves, beast masters, klaxon (giant insects), and Dragon Kin.\nCombining schools of magic, races, world size, you have limit less games.  Oh, did I mention there are two worlds to conquer?\n\nThe AI was pretty good also, you are not just fighting four other wizards for control of the worlds, there are neutral cities, wondering monsters, ruins, etc….\n\nThe only bad thing about MoM was it has 1994 graphics and sound, but that didn’t stop me from patching it to run on every PC on every operating system I have used between now and then.   MoM is hands down my favorite PC game.\nTo paraphrase Ron White…  “I told you about that game to tell you about this one”\n\nWorlds of Magic, at the time of this review (Oct 6th) it is still in Early Access.  Currently WoM only supports four Race types, 12 schools of magic, and three Worlds.   The developers have said another major release is scheduled to show in a few days.  (Bring on the Orcs)\n\nI can’t say enough about this game.  While still in development this game is on the fast track to surpassing the original, while still holding true to the heart of the game.\n\nYea I am a fanboy, so what this is a great game.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.\n","October 6, 2014","true","191.9"," 23 of 36 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","23","36","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Finnmark/recommended/265970/","Finnmark","Redhotviking","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Finnmark/","205 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA Brilliant Spiritual Successor to Master of Magic.\n\nAfter release I sat down and played this game, it strikes me as a much slower game than Master of Magic was. The Races are very VERY Unbalanced if I do say so myself.\n\nMy suggestion for new players is to use Grey Elves as your first race, their first unit the Archers only require food as upkeep cost and it will make things a ton easier, as you get more comfortable with how the game works you can go on to try the more challenging races.\n\nMy Favoritt Races are: Grey Elves, High Men, Draconic, Orcs and last but not least the Unhallowed.\n\nThe Living races are not to different from one another, but some races are much slower in terms of growth while others are much quicker. Orcs are one of the faster races, giving you the ability to build cities and have decent defenses pretty early, while Grey Elves and Dragonic are much slower making it a rather tedious waiting preiod to get a proper population to make the buildings you need and give you the income of gold you require to afford a superior army. Overall I prefer Earth Magic over the other magic forms, it has a steady supply of City improvement spells like Food and Production bonus, while also having the near cheat Acid Arrow spell, acid arrow can decemate a troop before they even reach your army, and with grey elves archers picking at the attacking army it is even deadlier. The Grey elf second starting unit the Druid has this spell and can cast it twice before running out of mana, making them very nice unit to have in the start.\nIn addition to these very potent spells, you also get the Slime Elemental, a rather beefy unit that can stand in the way of several ground units, again giving your archers time to make them into swiss cheese.\n\nAs for Orcs: they lack ranged attacks and that makes them inferior when facing flying enemies like dragonic, but many of their melee fighters have throwing axes making them able to attack the flying units in melee, but at a severly reduced damage output. However where the Orcs really shine is in ground troops with great armor and damage, and throwing axes works as a "First Strike" attack making them deal even more damage to ground melee units. Their spell casters are severly lacking but the one they do have is a decent addition to an orc army.\n\nThe Dragonics: They have less units per squad in their army, this is to pay for their overall superior stats and flying. They have more health per unit in a squad and if leveled up a bit they can really cause problems. The Great thing with every unit being able to fly is the Overworld movement speed as all terrain are easily travled, Also facing walls are really not an issue and ground troops of most races are standing there looking pretty silly, which makes the Javilineers of the Dragonic race a very delicious little troop. As they have ranged and flying they can easily move towards the enemy and start filling them with holes. The Javilineer has the drawback of reduced accuracy and range compeared to other ranged units, but since they stand safe only a few hexes away from an enemy unit it matters very little.\n\nAs for the Unhallowed the fact that the race do not like gold or have any effect of unrest you can take the penalties when making your Archmage: Like Astetic which is a penalty to amount gold you can hoard and Tyrant which greatly affects the amount of unrest if you were playing a Living Race. However to quicken building it uses the population of the city, and the negative energy is used for buildings and units. Also Heroes are not possible to have, or at least I have yet to acquire one during my Unhallowed plays. Unhallowed lack of unrest and simplified mechanics are pretty great, however if you play the race you start on the shadow plane if you have made the plane possible to travel too, this has benefits and drawbacks. The benefits is that you will have a lot of Negative Energy Resource tiles to use, you do not need to corrupt the land before building new cities but the drawback is that you are facing undeads and only them. If you are like me and enjoy being all dark and sinister when playing an evil race, you end up having Mastery of Death and 9 ranks in death magic, I strongly advice to take Combat Magic Circle for the access to Disrupt undead, taking life seems well "Wrong". But Disrupt undead will greatly aid you when fighting other undeads, a second element some undeads are weak towards is fire, and having flaming weapon spell will work wonders to your units. Death magic has a very nice summon: the Skeleton for 20 mana and no upkeep you get a very weak but cheap unit to not only move around the map so that you can conqure cities with ease. Skeletons have the piercing resistance and the first unit of the Unhallowed are a Skeleton Archer, this makes the Skeleton summoned able to withstand the damage the skeleton archer does with ranged attacks, giving you the chance to use the spells to win. In my opinion: do not rush often with the Unhallowed, as the drop in population might bite you in the behind later, but there are some exceptions: Shrine, Temple and Patheon are VERY powerful buildings for the Unhallowed. Not only do they give you a Mana Power income they also improve the acquistion of Negative Energy, affects the population growth somewhat (because of this) they also have no upkeep. I often choose to Rush Temple and Patheon because the amount of population i "lose" is still recovered faster with building housing than the actual building, but for the duration I have lost population it affects Negative Energy and Power Income so it is still not the best idea, only if you can "Afford" it.\n\nOverall this is a great tactical game for those that enjoy such games and well worth the money.","September 12, 2014","true","181.1"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","25","41","0","0"

However, it's easy to see that while the gameplay of the old MoM game is still great, the graphics and engine are very dated.\n\nThus, Worlds of Magic was created.  Worlds of Magic can be thought of as MoM v2.0 as it takes almost all of what we liked in MoM and re-imagined it in a modern setting with better graphics and more intricate spells/AI.  There is a lot of depth to this game, and it definitely does a good job setting itself apart from other 4X's out there.

(Always a danger for a company to market a beta product, but sometimes budgets demand it). All that said, I have to review the product as it is, with some extrapolation as to what it probably will become.\n\nI'm a lifer in this 4x genre, having played just about everything in it for 20+ years. Fantasy 4x is rare, and my favorite. So, how does this game stack up against MoM (the classic)? I'd say it's off to a good start.\n\nGood:\n-Very MoM-like, with updated graphics and a similar interface. Possibly, it's a little too similar, but I like the squares and the randomness of the worlds, etc... Let's be honest, I love them!\n-Lots of classic fantasy races (I HATE made up races, or "six flavors of humans" games. Give me an Elf and a Dwarf, dammit).\n- You build your own faction/Wizard. Variety and strategy right from the "New Game" screen.\n-Create your own items, unit experience, construct your empire city-by-city, tactical combat maps with full control, etc.\n\nMaybe just because its Beta:\n-The interface feels rough in spots, but I'm fairly sure that this will be improved. As it is, you might be put off at first until you get used to it. Give it 5+ hours before giving up.\n-The AI is a little weak, but they're working on that.\n-There are bugs, but it has yet to crash on me.\n-Right now, it is a cpu hog. Runs fine on my gaming rig, but not on my notebook (which is an I7 with a vid card).\n-No real diplomacy yet.\n\nThe Bad:\n-The screen feels crowded with stuff. Makes it difficult to read the map especially when a new player is starting out. Possibly some of the 3-d Icons will be reduced in size so they don't stack up into a junkyard-blur in the future.\n-The biggest area where it differs from MoM is a critical one: tactical combat resolution. The map and movement, etc, is the same, but when you attack it figures out what happens differently. They went with a D&D clone D20 system, where you have reflex saves and the like. The main problem I see with it is the increased variation of results. Sometimes, a settler will crit and kick your swordsman azz. I would suggest they go thru and tighten the dice rolls, making it 3D6+7, maybe, instead of 5D6 damage. Could even be an option. Also, crits should probably do +50% instead of 2x damage. This matters because things like enchantment spell bonuses are unbalanced in relative value if you can just "get lucky" also, it's annoying to have reload and replay battles due to crits. Could be an option to disable crits (that would take like 10 minutes of programming time).\n\nOverall, I have high hopes. Modding options might help some balance issues, such as the value of various spells, etc. The AI is often a weak spot in 4x games, I'm hoping they'll give it a few more IQ points before release.\n\n\n\n\n","March 11, 2015","true","28.0"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","17","29","2","0"

This game still needs some work on AI, UI, and game balance, but the game is still in Early Access and all of those things are in the works.  The Developers are actively listening to their customers and making adjustments to give them what they want.  This is a rare quality with developers these days and should not be ignored.\n\nWill all of those things be completely ironed out by release?  No, but I have faith that the developers willl to continue improve on the game after its release.\n\nContent -  Worlds of Magic has less to offer in races than its predecesor, but more will be released in future updates.  It offers up to 6 different planes to travel between instead of only 2, and it is nice to be able to decide which ones you want in your game before you start it.  This game does actually have more spells, but most are of a level so high that you may never actually see them in the game.  Spell research times may need to be looked into.\n\nUser Interface - The menu/information system in this game needs a major overhaul.  It either takes too long to find the information you are looking for, or there are too many steps to get to it.  At the moment the UI feels more like an obsticle than a convenience.  This is curently being worked on by the developers to not only make it more user friendly, but to add in more of the modern conveniences one expects from a 4X game these days.\n\nTooltips/Descriptions - The game is still lacking a number of tooltips and general information.  Such as the stats of a hero before you decide to hire them, or the upkeep cost of a spell when choosing which ones you will start with.  These are items I'm sure will be addressed in time and a number of tooltips have already been added since my initial review.\n\nAI - The AI in this game has seem some great improvement over the last month and will only get better as we get closer to release.  There are still some minor issues, but as stated above, it's being worked on.\n\nGame Balance/flow - The undead race still needs some tweaking as I feel they still get the raw deal overall.  The start of the game is still pretty slow, but not as slow as before.  Don't expect to hit the ground running, this is more of a slow build.\n\nGame Stability - Game stability has greatly improved and I now rarely run into game freezes.  Once in a while I may run into a "wait, what just happened?" moment, but it's moving in the right direction.\n\nThe game still has plenty of room for improvement, but it's still in Early Access.  Given time, I feel this will develop into a polished gem.  Never have I had more faith in the developers of a game.  My initial review of this game was not favorable at all, but the responsiveness of the developers combined with the progress they have made has changed my outlook on the future of this game.  (this rarely happens with me)\n\nI'll keep playing it as they release new patches/updates and likewise update this review as needed.

Turn resolution takes way too long, espcially on gigantic and collosal maps with all planes enabled. The main factor is the resolution of all those neutral cities. Even early on it already takes several minutes for the game to resolve the turns of all those neutral cities. Either speed it up or give players the option to disable neutral cities altogether.\nII. Diplomacy. Even when the AI isn´t even close to you it just declares war after x turns of meeting you. There is no trigger, it just seems totally arbitary.

The many races in master of magic? nope by half of them. the many tactical posibillities of master of magic? nope. a game that wrotes new rules to the tbs genree? heeeel no, it's far under 0, there are tbs games out there far better in all and every aspect...\n+1 for the optimistic view of the developers\n+1 for trying\n-alot for the rest.\n","June 15, 2015","false","26.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

While I have literally thousands of hours gaming . . . I do not have the technical background.  I will try to get assistance for this tomorrow from a friend.\n\nI am at 59 hours and turn 350 (still).  Multiple lock-ups on this one and several reloads of the game have not fixed it.  I have determined that the Elementalist spells can sometimes be reset if you cast a spell (from the known spell list).  I am not sure why this would allow them to reset and it does not work 100% of the time.\n\nI must tell you that the Elementalists (while one of my favorites) are a bit overpowered IMO.  I have two armies of these and they are unbeatable so far.  They are not even maxed out on levels but when Fireball is working they do so much damage (and in a large area) that nothing can stand against them.  Also, anything 'land based' does not even move against a flying unit so they just stand there until I blast them.  I suppose that a squad of really high level ranged units might be a problem but the AI isn't going to build a totally ranged group.  Maybe you could lower the damage in the surrounding tiles but leave the 'target tile' at max damage or something?\n\nI have found that the AI units on tiles with a structure (library, tomb, etc.) cannot  be attacked.  Is this intentional?  Are the players units "safe" if on these tiles as well?","September 24, 2014","true","104.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","10"

The artwork is superb and already the game balance and execution of the ideas are superior to Master of Magic. As of this writing all that remains is polish, clean-up, and other "fiddly details". I cannot wait for the full product, which will surely surpass it's predecessor and become a masterful game in it's own rightful way.

I'm personally more annoyed by the fact that the interface is designed with 16:9 aspect ratio in mind and kind of falls apart in 4:3.

That is not just cheating. That is absurd and stupid in many ways. Then as the game prolongs the AI will keep making the same level 1 and 2 units in massive stacks, only to throw them at me without me taking any casulties... I am sorry, but u are selling a game that is "mostly" singleplayer - atleast wthout network multiplayer funktion.

Like many of the reviews thus far, I also had a long standing love affair with Master of Magic. In my opinion, this game is a faithful and loving reproduction of that classic title. The difficulty is pretty hard, which makes for challenging tactical battles even when you think you've got it in the bag. The pacing is slow and deliberate, emphasizing deep strategic decision making. Ultimately, I think the developers still have a little more work to put in to this early access title, but I like the direction they're heading in.\n\nGood: Tactical battles and overworld views make battle feel important and engaging, giving it a leg up on the competition. Spell selections and varying planes of existence add a dimension to this 4X title (no pun intended) that most don't have.\n\nBad: The pacing drags on a little long, especially in the beginning while you develop food.\n\nUgly: The game is in Early Access, and still has a few miles to go before the big 1.0, but over all I think it's on the right track. The "New Player Help" dialogues are pretty distracting and hard to totally get rid of, and the assessment of battle difficulty is skewed a bit. I once had four swordsmen get utterly demolished by a djinn because the battle forecaster said "Easy".\n\nUltimately, this game is a hell of a good time, and well worth your money.

I caution people who don't know and love Master of Magic to maybe wait on buying Worlds of Magic till it's a little more finished, as it is quite incomplete at the moment.\n\nBut what is currently done is nothing less than spectacular.  As someone who wasted weeks and months of my life playing MoM back in the 9s, I can see how amazing this game will be.  Keeping true all of the elements that made MoM and many other 4x games so amazing, it's infused with fantastic graphics and play style that catapults me back to an earlier time and leaves me wanting more more more more!\n\nI can not wait to play this game more and can't wait till the product is finished, so i can sink more of my life into it.","October 13, 2014","true","15.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

I personally have been enjoying the game and it does remind me a lot of MOM. I recommend the game with reservations:    Know that this game is not done, you may have issues/bugs, and saves may be corrupted with new updates.  I have been able to play for the last few hours without any crashes or issues (others have reported some issue, likely related to their specific systems.     If you know what you are getting into, it can be great fun.\nIf you have played and enjoy MOM in the past, you should like this game as well (it plays very similarly).   If you haven't, it plays much like many of the 4x fantasy games such as AOW, HOMM but more in a "you against all others" kind of way.  There are no real scenarios;  just start up in a random world and explore, expand and conquer.    Diplomacy doesn't do much for me yet.\n\nI have been part of a dozen or so EA (early access) games and these developers have been one of the best at communication and updates, as well as responding well to user input.     They give me confidence that they will follow through and make this a great finished product.   I will keep this updated as time goes on.

It does need a bit of QA, as I'll get into there are a few bugs, thankfully not many crash bugs and the autosave plus quick load times makes those only a little annoying.\n\nI get the feeling that this was not released as "Early Access" to avoid the increasingly bad stigma that label is getting thanks to unscrupulous developers. As I said, this would have been a good use of it; mainly I want the assurance that some bugs and features will be worked on.\n\nAnyway, that's the summary of this review. If you're interested in the mechanics of the game, see below. If not... Well, give this game a shot anyway if you've read this far, at least keep an eye on it for sales.\n\n\nHeroes can be quite powerful but armies are still needed to win the day, which is actually a bit of an improvement over the original MoM where heroes could rapidly become overwhelmingly powerful. Melee and Caster heroes are far better than ranger/rogue type though; ranged weapons just do not hit hard enough for heroes. Caster and Ranged armies are far better than melee though.\n\nThe Spell system is very well done. The balance and detail are quite nice. There are almost too many spell rings that it takes a long time to explore them all. It also feels a bit weird that Life magic has so many attacks that work on living creatures, but it does make the category more attractive without just relying on buffs. I only have two real complaints about the spell system: on loading a game, my Flaming Guardians spell stopped working. I'm still paying upkeep, but the two Fire Gians no longer appear, which is sad, they were extremely helpful. The only other spell bug I've run into is more of an AI issue: the enemy will sometimes use Holy Word when it is utterly useless to do so. I attacked him with only Living troops, so holy word did nothing; it would absolutely be devastating if I had an army of Undead, sure, but the AI should probably check for that before wasting time and mana on an expensive spell.\n\nNow some comments on the races, since MoM was always big on alternate races:\n\nHigh Men - Okay, I haven't played them yet. They seem balanced enough from what units I ran into. They have cheap cannon-fodder melee, some competent melee, healers, and strong archers, and probably a few I haven't seen yet.\n\nUnhallowed - Undead. Kinda a cool idea, definately more powerful on the Negative energy plane, cause duh. Haven't played them enough to really comment on balance. They get hosed by Life magic spells, so watch out for that. Goes well with Death magic.\n\nOrcs - These guys are pretty weak. They have no ranged attackers and no fast units so every other race can pick them off easily. This is hilariously pathetic against Dark Elves since they have a unit that can cast Earth to Mud and slow the Orc's already bad movement speed, then massacre them with ranged attacks. This is kinda sad since Orcs were one of the better races in MoM, particularly their Wyvern Riders, and they had a better balance of units than even the Humans.\n\nGrey Elves - They're quite good. I'd recommend new players start here. They start with an archery unit and can build them quickly and cheaply, making them a horde-archer army. Some special foes are immune to archery, but Elves have enough other options to power through that. They could conceivably make a melee-only army that's actually effective with their Unicorn Riders, since they teleport.\n\nDark Elves - The Dark Elves have definatley seen at least as much D&D influence as MoM, and in some ways I'm not a fan of that. In MoM every Dark Elf unit could use a magic attack, but not here. Also added a lot of Spider motif, which is ok. The female-dominated army is nice since you never see that; I would say that's pure D&D but thanks to graphics we couldn't really tell in MoM. Overall as a race the Dark Elves have a strong and well-balanced army. Add in the fact that they give 1 power per populace and they're downright fantastic.\n\nThe... Bug people... - They're disappointing, but then they were in MoM too, so it's holding to source material there. They have the same crippling weakness as the Orc: too reliant on horde melee troops, which are easily slowed and destroyed. At least they have some good ranged attackers and some healers.\n\nDwarves - They're slow. They get some casters and ranged attackers, but damn they're slow. Since the computer usually uses a lot of melee units, this does mean the Dwarves are serviceable at least. As long as they aren't facing Elves.\n\nDraconians - Another true to form for MoM: all Draconian units fly. Flying ranged units are as fun as ever, and Doom Drakes appear to be the best melee unit you can train, and with a couple buffs they can quickly be the best in the game.\n\n\nAnd, quickly, races missing from MoM:\nHalflings: Oh right. Those existed.\nGnolls: Good riddance\nNomads: They were decent, a lot of overlap with Humans and Gnolls of all things\nBarbarians: Filler race.\nBeastman: The variety was sweet. Would be nice to see something like this again.\nTrolls: These guys were awesome. Simple meatheads that could still stand up to the "real" races.\nProbably something I'm forgetting. Must not have been important.","July 3, 2015","true","53.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","1"

They took MoM, updated the graphics, expanded the races, leaders, heroes, changed the first word of the name..., and called it a wrap.  This might sound unoriginal, but it is exactly what I've been requesting for years.\n\nSpells feel suitably powerful.  Heroes are exciting to find and level up.  Enemies expand and attack (middle difficulty).  Loot is fun to search out.\n\nThe bad...the interface & mouse-clicking are a bit "wonky" and take getting used to.  Mouse-clicking feels like "driving on the left-side of the road" - they didn't implement it in a way that feels natural.  The map and graphics don't scale well - limit zoom in/out and I can't get the text to be crisp on my machine.  Strategic map is worthless.\n\nAlso, I've read about lots of game bugs and crashes...so far (knock knock) I have not experienced any myself (17 hrs playtime in version 1.2.4)\n\nOverall, the game is a terrific "fix" for those who have been waiting for MoM 2.

Because I can't seem to play a full game.  I'm constantly being knocked out by roaming bands of monsters that are much stronger than anything that I can muster.  It would be nice if instead of having to restart for hours on end until there's a playable map to just have some options that negate certain problems.  A "roaming enemies?" click box would be nice.  So would a difficulty meter.  It's one thing to get slammed by a few spearman units, or something that's reasonable.  But seriously, how often are towns randomly attacked by actual animals?  So then I'm getting crushed constantly by werewolves?  Kinda ridiculous.\n\nI'm giving this a 7/10 for now, with the potential for a 10/10 if they can tweak it so I'm not constantly dying while trying to build up my first city.\n\n***\n\nWith the most recent updates I have finally gotten a playable game, and it's amazingly perfect.

An updated version of the game that I have not stopped loving, regardless of how much time passes and how many other games release?  I was excited, and I was a bit pensive as well.  Were they going to truly capture the feels I felt as a child?\n\nIn my opinion, they have.  Admittedly, it's difficult to replicate the feel of nostalgia I get with the game, coming downstairs during the early summer morning and watching my dad's budding Human empire grow slowly day by day before he heads off to work.  Many associates to Master of Magic to me had almost nothing to do with the game itself, though I still loved the game.\n\nWith Worlds of Magic, you have a lot of very familiar surroundings.  You can swap the camera to an overhead view that mirrors MoM.  Your city influence is the same fat plus at the start.  You can modify your farmer/worker ratio (and you have another option now, too!), you build armies, you build new cities, you explore caves and towers and magical sources of power around the world, you encounter enemies and fantastical creatures, you summon creatures, cast destructive spells, manipulate an enemy's city, buff your own city.  The Power system feels familiar, but the number of new spells and the way the Battleboard plays with the D20 system really add a lot of additional flavor for me.\n\nIt's like loving pizza all of your life, then someone brings you a piece of pizza with ranch dressing, and you're like "Oh wow, this is the same deliciousness, with a nice addition!"\n\nThat's how I feel about Worlds of Magic.  In addition, the devs have been borderline-insanely receptive to feedback.  I personally have pointed out early access bugs and quality of life changes that have, within days, been fixed or added to the game.  These devs *love* this game, and they are willing to hear feedback and incorporate it into the game if it sounds like a good idea.\n\nI can't wait to see this game grow over the years, and I can't wait to keep playing it (while also recommending it to my aforementioned dad, as well as my bro!).","March 12, 2015","true","88.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

You need certain buildings to be able to build others down the same line. And if you wish to produce a certain unit, you'll have to first build the prerequisite buildings in one of your cities. For instance, to produce the Crossbowmen unit, you need to have both a sawmill and an armory in your city. The sawmill in turn requires a builders hall, and the armory requires a smithy. So you cannot immediately start to produce Crossbowmen in a newly settled city.\n\nThe magic is handled very similar to Master of Magic. You have a certain pool of power available. You invest that in three possible spheres;\n1; To increase your spellcasting power, said power dictates how much mana you can channel each turn, and as such, how many/powerful spells you can cast. For overland spells, you can cast any spell, but if your power is lower than the total mana cost, it'll take more than a single turn to cast. For a combat spell, you need to have a spellcasting power at least equal to the mana cost to be able to cast a spell.\n2; To research new spells. You start out knowing a set number of spells, dependent on how many and which spell spheres you've chosen to know from the beginning. To learn new spells, you need to be eligble (have the required spheres for said spell) and invest the power to research them.\n3; To increase your mana reserves. Without mana, you cannot cast new spells, and you cannot maintain already cast spells including any summons.\n\nConsidering this is still just in alpha, I've already sunk more hours into playing it than I'd expected. It just keeps sucking me in. The "one more turn" vibe is strong here. The appeal to me, is clear. It FEELS like Master of Magic in a new skin, even if the underlying mechanics have changed (to an adaptation of the D20 rules set).\n\nI can heartily recommend the game. I don't regret backing it when it was just a kickstarter project.","September 15, 2014","true","41.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","1"

So it has the same 4X formula, along with spellcasting at global and tactical level, spell research, and various races to play as. As far as capturing that old MoM gameplay feel, WoM nails it.\n\nThe graphics are a mix of gorgeous and merely good. Some of the planes of existence, units and buildings look stunning! Some of the spell animations and the way that persistent spells are displayed could be improved upon. (at the moment, there's no specific animation or effect for a persistent spell that's been placed on a unit; e.g. think of the ice shields in Diablo3).\n\nThere are some things I'd like to see change; for example, the enemy Lords could use some extra writing or graphics to give them a but more of a personality (at the moment they're devious opponents but they seem to prefer to keep things discreet. They're not the same type of flashy enemies that MoM had).\n\nThe game rules are super solid. Economies are finely balanced, there's a challenging learning curve and high-level magic feels suitably powerful and effective. This is one of those games where you can end up shaping the world you live in to better suit your needs.\n\nMost importantly it has that 'one more turn' feeling that a good strat game needs to have.

If you enjoyed that game, you will likely enjoy WoM.\n\nAs an early access player, I able to see the game progress from largely unplayable to an enjoyable experience.  Since the general release, I have played about 15 hours.  The initial release was bumpy, to say the least; however, after an initial difficulty getting the game to run, the recent hot-fix has allowed me to play for a few hundred turns with only one freeze which I was able to recover from using the autosave.\n\nI have few criticisms of the interface... it may be cumbersome at first, but with familiarity, I found it to be not too bad.  Similarly, once you get used to the 3d map, the features become more recognizable.  If you miss a few along the way, well there are lots to chose from anyway, and you see them eventually in any case as play moves along.\n\nI am a little disappointed with the current AI as it does not explore well not expand into other planes... necessary to be competitive.\n\nThat being said, from early access to now, I have seen remarkable improvements in AI and am fairly confident that Wastelands will continue to improve it to a state where it is as proficient as any AI in the business.  I can not understate the remarkable progress the designers have made during the course of development, and this gives me confidence that the game we see today will be far outstripped by the one that will arise in the future.  I fully expect various bugs and AI deficiencies to be addressed over the next few months.\n\nAs is, I am enjoying playing the game.  I am a builder and enjoy clearing the various goody huts.   Combat with other lords is not my forte or the most enjoyable part of the game for me.  Exploring is really fun and building your forces so that you can start clearing features is rewarding in and of itself.  I expect that as development progress, I will have to face new challenges... I look forward to that as well.\n\nI recommend purchasing this product... if not now, I think that potential buyers should not dismiss the game's potential in the future, and if they are hesitant about purchasing immediately, come back and see the game has progressed in a few months.","March 21, 2015","true","480.0"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","10","21","2","0"

Wi has done a nice job of taking this classic up a notch, and the best part is that unlike MoM, WoM will be patched to near perfection.  The differences between the titles so far are pretty similiar, however WoM has shown to be a better balanced game by not having overly powerful summons right from the start.  Also the way magic is organized in WoM is far superior to MoM.\n\nAfter a week of playing it; (v1.05), I can say that I am pleased how hard the developers are working to make this game bug free.

This game still needs a few options for customization and bug fixes, much more than it needs new content, but both are welcome and the developers have beeen relentlessly patching the game weekly. If you like the orginal, this will bring back memories with some new variations. If you like Age of Wonders, also largely based on Master of Magic, you should like this. Fallen Enchantress is another similarly derivative game. WoM however, follows the original the most closely.\n\nWorks on both Mac and Windows., but has some bugs that generally still allow for play. I admit to wanting to support development of these games so I am less price concious, but if you are interested there will probably be a sale during the summer.\n\nSpecific Problems:\n\nThe heroes system needs rebalancing; currently they are largely useless by the time you get them. Early on, they are very expensive for the economy and too weak even at level five to be helpful. I don't want them all to be Torin, but the level five should be level 1 and go up in a timely fashion while offering some abilities in army support or mana.  Mostly though you  get them late in the game, and by the time you get them they are irrelevant. Fame does not seem to help either.\n\nA hall of fame and scoring would be nice.\n\nI would like to save customized Sorceror Lords.\n\nAllow custom quick start parameters and randomization\n\nThe AI needs work\n\n\nI have now played over 150 hours and plan to keep playing.

No more forgetting that rogue group of elementals until they pop up at your city gates), the cities are again with fixed borders (as much as i like civilization, i hate the expanding border system vs AI). The different spell schools are back (and improved, you can, as before, select life, death, but also summoning, containing all the summon spells across the discipline, but only those). and you feel that the developers try to cover the essence of the races (grey elves, mostly like the highelves in MoM don'T get too powerful ranged units, but their mages an cast the guiding wind spell, countering ranged mali, making a group of archers/rangers with a mage very useful and catches the supernatural spirit regarding elven archery). unhallowed (undead) are also a nice new deature, feel a bit broken though, needs some balancing)\n\nBUT:\nThis game is FAR from being finished/worth the price. The are still many gamebraking bugs (bugs in battle forcing you to clsoe the program), UI annoyances (move unit in battle, ui skips to next one so you have to reselect and attack, does NOT skip to next unit after it cast a spell) some mechanic problems (fire shield spell broken, works not just vs close combat but vs everything. put in on a sturdy unit, attack grey elf city, win by just standing there getting shot at), and quite a few other problems.\n\nso yes, if you loved MoM you WILL love this game, keep an eye on it BUT DON'T buy it yet, it's a beta with many problems. but if it gets fixed, it is what you loved about MoM and more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oerwinde/recommended/265970/","oerwinde","Oerwinde","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oerwinde/","280 products in account","Ok, So my previous review was based on a bunch of playtime in the EA state, and about an hour in the official release, which hadn't really changed all that much from when I played EA. After more time in the official release I will upgrade to a recommended, but I still feel like as a spiritual successor it falls short.\n\nPress N. Thats what changed my mind about this game. The standard map view is too busy and too zoomed in and with the way tiles don't blend very well was very straining on the eyes. Changing the camera to a top down view changed the feel of the game immensely, even if it did cut out some of the nicer graphical touches on landmarks.\n\nAnyway, the bad. The UI is rather unintuitive, I find myself constantly moving units I don't want moved because it defaults the selection to all units in a stack rather than just active ones, the build buttons are off in the middle/top of the city screens instead of down by the build queue where they should be. Sometimes I end up wasting mana when casting spells because rather than cast it when I'm done it gives me a "ready to cast" notification in the bottom that I don't notice until I've ended my turn.\n\nPlus there are just some little things that have been in other 4x games for years that are just odd they weren't included. Such as directing engineers to build roads along a route, instead you have to move them each tile manually whenever they complete building the road on a single tile. When you build cities it automatically names them without any input from you. City borders don't appear to expand, and if you build too close to another the border lines just double up rather than joining. I was also hoping for a better map generation algorythm for release. Although the random mishmash of map tiles definitely brings back Master of Magic, thats not one of the things that should have been brought back. Having some sort of tectonic generation that produces cleaner variations of map tiles would have been nice, instead of having mountains, desert, swamp, forest, and plains all within the borders of one city.\n\nThat said there is a lot to like. The team did a great job on building the lore around the factions, and the art in the Sorceror Lord and factions selection screens is top notch. While they couldn't use some of the exact names from Master of Magic, the characters are some pretty obvious references, with some excellent updates. Combat isn't as straight forward as it could be, and with the d20 system sometimes bigger numbers don't always translate to victory. This can lead to more in depth combat strategies, but also to some frustration. Theres a good variety of spells and units, and the factions all feel unique.\n\nIts a closer successor to Master of Magic than a lot of others claiming the title, but  the little things matter. Master of Magic always felt fun, with level up and recruitment annoucements coming with some trumpeted fanfare, the bright colours, and the upbeat music. Worlds of Magic feels very modern by comparison, and not in a good way, with a lot of brown, a darker tone, and just less of a fun feel. That said, it is fun to play, and thats what games are about.","March 19, 2015","true","13.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","11"

There are a number of improvements and a few things that are worse from the old classic. The improvements include better graphics, new races, new sovereigns/wizards, and the addition of multiple plaes vice just the two from the original game. The few drawbacks include how they work engineers.rioad construction, the hero screen and equipping items, and some difficulty figuring out the interface. The interface can be counter intuitive in some cases but it works fine. I've had two freezes/crashes in the first 6-8 hours, but I think one was steam related as I dropped to desktop and steam quit.\n\nAreas for improvement:\n-Easier access to empire wide information\n-Better hero management\n-Fix the road construction\n-minimum distance for starting opponents\n\nAreas that are fine as is:\n-Tough wandering stacks that force you to defend your cities\n-A good mix of special locations/goody huts\n-Very low gold/food rate that prevents you from building huge armies or every city building\n-The planes all looking and feeling different\n\nWhile there are still a few rough edges, I'm really enjoying the game.","March 21, 2015","true","58.2"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","9","20","2","0"

It was released before being ready to be release due to contractual obligations, however the devs are patching the game on a daily basis lmost and are always on the forum keeping a look out for bugs or questions and sugestions.\n\nDuring early access the devs have been the most responsive and actually using feedback from the testers. So many things were introduced and changed due to feedback which shows the passion of the devs fr this project.\n\nSo why is this a great game? It has a great civilisation building depth while not going so deep that it's a headache.\n\nThere are tons and tons of spells and you can use many combinations and archieve tactical victories through many means. Either having hordes of empored units or great damaging spells or taking control of the enemy. Just to name a few really... The whole game has a great deal of depth without actually going into the realm of grand strategy depth.\n\nSo what are the problems? Well the first one relates to the learning curve. Until you learn what you need to have a good start and what enemy units can do you will find yourself being kicked in the rear time and time again. You will however not have much of a problem if you used to play MoM since it's a lot like it.\n\nNow for the temporary problems. There are a few spells missing. There are a few disciplines missing, sounds are mising (it was outsourced and the guys screwed so it got late to the devs), there are bugs (most not game breaking though), there is a lack of polish and there is some more optimisation to be done. Now for me and many people these aren't really anything that will stop the enjoyment of the game. However, with so much updating and bug fixing coming so quickly, more often than not saves are not compactible so if you don't have a lot of time to play, it's very possible that you won't be able to finish games for a while.\n\nI imagine that it will take it a couple weeks to a month at best to get everything missing and have the game relatively bug free (at least without gamebreaking bugs (there aren't any now but they show up every now and then with an update)).\n\nSo if you can't deal with the current state of teh game, hold off in buying it for a couple of weeks or a month. if you can deal with it, it's a great game and it will only get better. Definitly the best 4X made since MoM.","March 25, 2015","true","164.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Dissapointed considering how much i payed. It should at least play.\n\nThey updated it and now the maps load. Progress.\n\n1/19/15\nKey problems with this game.\n1 Level progression and PVE is terrible. Like ridiculous.\nExample. Start out and have highest level mobs all around you. Spend lets just say 25 (it's going to be more than that) turns on city building. You still wont have a hero, you might be able to defeat a few mobs and maybe even see the enemy AI. Now triple the amount of turns and be in exactly the same place.\n\n2 Enemy AI. It sucks. All of it, from random monsters to enemy commanders. Could still change before release though, so dont hold it against this game. More sad than anything. Heroes of Might and Magic 3 has more interesting enemy tactics.\n\n3 Tooltips. They also suck. Alot. Be prepared to waste entire games on spells that aren't described correctly. Heroism is a great example: in the tooltip it refers the spell as leveling a unit up to MAX (which seems to do nothing, levels dont SEEM to matter, but im sure they do somehow), what it doesnt tell you is that its an ENCHANTMENT and only levels the unit until you turn off the enchantment, also doesnt work on heroes (HINT: PUT THAT IN THE TOOLTIP).\n\n4 The overall look. Its dirty, its ugly and fairly unappealing. I play dwarf fortress and i call this UI ugly. Not indescipherable, just ugly.\n\n5 Heroes. They suck. Which is fine, but they are basically just caster units and its IMPOSSIBLE to properly equip them in any reasonable amount of time.\n\n6 PROGRESSION. There seems to be none.\n\n7 Map spawn options. Can i make more mountains? Controlling the difficulty of the PVE parts of the map (lower/higher monsters) etc would be cool but doesnt exist, be prepared to play fairly identical maps, though this could change.\n\nPOSITIVES!\n\nI love the races, they are actually different.\nPlethora of magic spells! Some cool ideas that might even work one day.\nThe crafting system shows alot potential but barely works.\nThe planes are cool, as is the traveling between them.\nALL them sorcerer options, damn good, maybe the best part of the game as it stands now.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nI have unistalled this game. You should be able to see why. I regret buying this game as well. Maybe it will be better at release.

All the pieces are there.

There's no story, there's no QTE, there's no awesome custcenes that masquerade as content but really just force you on a path the developers want you to follow.  It's your oldschool 4x game with a fantasy twist.\n\nThe game was apparently rushed and has it's rough edges. I'm also not a fan of the artwork.

So much hopes. Yet so much frustration.\nI know this is Early Access but given that release is almost there i suppose thing i would mention won't change.\ntl;dr version - extremely poor for set price(I bought it with 25% discount and I think I just wated my money), they should offer it with 80% discount, no less.\nGraphics. Game feels like being made by some students for food. It looks acceptable on screenshots but you'll be freaking ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off with visuals ingame, and yes I'm talking about graphics in 4X strategy being 4X lover, trust me this game looks bad.\nUser Interface. It is inconvenient. I mean there's hella lot of things scattered around and you must check here, there and there to get full picture of something. Nothing compared to Endless Legend or Fallen Enchantress nice and firm UIs. Also spell icons are so similar and texts are so small you'll have hard time reading what you're going cast/research.\nAtmosphere. There's no atmosphere, no city or places or unit sound to immerse you, no effects. No unified visual style. Text for desciptions is very blunt, written withou passion, noone beat AoW for unit and races descriptions as for, but this game is too bad to even try to compare. Old MoM still easily beats it by being more atmospheric.\nGuide.

It is the Masters of Magic i have been waiting for.\nIgnore the Negitive Reviewers of this Game...Guessing they are trying to run this game with a system that is less then a Pentium i5. If you have a system that is less than a Pentium i5, you might want to buy this game and wait till you upgrade your system to run it on.\nI own a Pentium i7 2600k with a AMD Radeon HD 7800 series Video Card..Set at highest Graphics, LOVE IT! No Prob.\n\nSeveral Suggestions i can make to you people that have less then my machine's capabilites.\n1. Don't try to run the game in Highest Graphics, instead of the Option of running GOOD, try Fastest.\n2. Don't try to play the game with more then 2 worlds, and don't choose the COLOSAL SIZE map, go for small to average size. COLOSAL MAPS are VERY VERY BIG, so if your trying to play it with that size with 6 worlds, your turns will take forever.\n3. Play with just 3 or 4 Lords, Not with 10-12, again, your turns will take to long for slower machines.\n4. Press the "N" button to change the view of the map, the 3D effects will slow down your scrolling of the map. Same Suggestion when you go into battle, TURN OF THE 3D by pressing your "N" button.\n5. If i can think of anymore suggestions, i will add them in this comment.\n6. MAKE SURE YOUR RUNNING YOUR SYSTEM IN 64 BIT MODE!!!\n\nNow, onto the bugs of the game. Very few and minor, I think the new updated patch is now 1.2.6.\n1. JUST TO BE SAFE, SAVE YOUR GAME BEFORE GOING INTO BATTLE!!!! incase an army unit locks up your game play, you can always ALT+F4 the game and reload it, and the problem goes away...only happened to me 1 time.\n2. The Battle Summary Screen slider bar does NOT slide to the right, if you want to slide it to the right, slide LEFT instead. No biggie, easy fix on the next Patch (I hope :) ).\n3. On the MAGIC screen, spell being researched dosn't show how many turns untill compleated, if you want to know how many turns until the spell you are researching is compleated, click on that spell, it will take you to your SPELL BOOK, and then click the "X" button to get out of your SPELL BOOK, and it will bring you back to your MAGIC screen and show you how many turns it will take untill your spell is researched.   Again, no biggie, probably will be fixed on the next Patch.\n4. ENGINEERS - In the old MOM game, you could stack a bunch of engineers in a stack to build a road in far less of a time as compaired to just have 1 engineer build a road. For Example: 6 engineers could build 1 road in about 1 turn. 1 engineer could build 1 road in about 6 turns. Well, not so much in WoM, you stack 6 engineers in 1 stack, and try to build 1 road, its like your local county workers, 1 guy will work to build the road, and the 5 others just stand around and watch. So, all i can suggest is to line your engineers in the line you want your road built, and just wait out the 4-6 turns to have them build it.   Hope they fix that problem in the next Patch.\n5. Some might find moving your armies around a little difficult, just remember 1 thing when you are moving your armies, IF your army men are appearing in the upper left hand corner of your screen, your still in MOVEMENT/ACTION mode, to get them out of that mode, just click on that stack again to make your army disappear from the upper left hand corner of your screen.\n6. If you move your men NORTH,SOUTH,EAST,or WEST, say on the PLAINS, it will cost you just 1 movement point, but, if you move NW,NE,SW,or SE, it will cost you 2 movement points, again, on PLAINS.\n\nIf you are a true admire of the original Masters of Magic...BUY THIS GAME!!\n\nI Reserve the right to come back and re-edit my comments if i find more "Bugs" when i play more of the game, and more of the Lords, with their Factions.\n\nSo far i am playing only 2 worlds on COLOSAL size, with HIGH MEN, and a PREMADE HIGH-MEN LORD (which only allows me to have a maximum of 1000 Gold in my Treasury..)\n\nThats all for now...man i really LOVE this game. I SALUTE the makers of WoM, Keep up the Great Work, don't let the nay-sayer bring you down. Just keep up with fixing the bugs to perfect the game.

While I can handle game crashes the mechanics still seem to need work.  I have started a number of games in very detremental positions for a starting city, barely capable of producing anything beyond the units and buildings I started with.  The combat engine is very unforgiving and I reqularly loose units to low threat challenges because of the NPCs high rates of criticals and difficulty to be hit.  I have lost armies where I have outnumbered my enemies 3-to-1 or better because the NPCs constantly got criticals.  So far my games have all ended in defeat, usually at the hands of werewolves, before I can start constructing walls.  The Mentor option has been particularly frustrating too, as you start with a hero that pretty much destroys your economy due to it's upkeep.\n\nStill, I have hopes for this game.  If they can field this game with all the options MoM had and then expand on top of what MoM had, it will turn out well.","October 19, 2014","false","151.7"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","2"

Nothing I said in the original review is invalidated, but the game is barely in a playable state at the moment. I cannot in good conscience recommend a purchase of this game until it is stable and playable enough to be enjoyable. The devs are great and their hearts are clearly in the right place, but the nature of the bugs and the sheer volume of them have shaken my confidence that the devs can produce a polished definitive release candidate within a reasonable time frame. I hope to be proven wrong, and will write another addendum to this review if / when I am.\n\nIf you loved Masters of Magic back in the day this game is for you. I base my recommendation on the potential of the game and the devotion of the development team. It is easy to tell where this game is heading and I believe great things are on the horizon. That being said, there is one caveat...The game is what I would consider "early" early access. The game is not yet feature complete and there will be bugs that may hamper your progression through the game. Fortunately, the dev team is working diligently to swat those bugs while adding new features at a rapid pace. Additionally, for once in the history of early access, player feedback is both appreciated and implemented.\n\nThings are moving rapidly in the right direction with frequent updates and constant communication from the devs. Give it a go if you want to support a game with good vision and a dev team that is responsive and dedicated. If you want a near finished game it's best to wait a bit until things are polished up a bit.","October 4, 2014","false","26.7"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","4"

I haven't played that game since it came out so my memory is not great.  I do see some of the influences though.  I'll let someone else make more comparisons there.\n\nWhat do I like about the game?\n\n1.  Setting:  I am a sucker for fantasy games and this is pure fantasy all the way through.  The various planes on which you can battle are well represented.\n\n2.  Graphics:  Overall, I like the graphics.  The animations are sometimes a bit stilted but overall I like it.  I particularly like seeing each city on the city screen evolve as I add more buildings.\n\n3.  Combat:  It's turn-based and d20 so you kind of feel like you're playing out an RPG battle at times.  I do feel cheated on occasion by the dice rolls but anyone who played D&D will understand that feeling.\n\n4.  Spells:  There are a ton of these, as there should be.  They run the usual RPG gamut from buffs to DOT's to direct damage spells and are nicely presented.\n\nOverall, you get a nice variety of races that play differently, a ton of fantasy type enemies to battle against, and all the 4X you can soak up.  Are there bugs?  Sure.  Is it perfect?  No.  But I strongly believe in the development team based on their support so far.

I remember buying the strategy guide, being blown away by its size, and then spending hours reading it and coming up with all sorts of magic/racial combos to try out.  For me, it was a magical game that let me escape from reality and be the powerful wizard that explored mysterious lands while ruling (sometimes kindly, sometimes not so much) a civilization.   Of course, MOM was hardly perfect (unbalanced races and spells, the AI wasn’t the brightest), but it was greater than the sum of its parts…at least for me.  It had that “one more turn” feeling that I loved.\n\nI backed Worlds of Magic during its first kickstarter.  I loved the concept and the developers definitely seem to want to recreate the magic that was in MOM while adding some fresh new ideas to change things up.  I was very excited when the game first came out on early release only to find it to be a buggy mess when I played it at that time.  Disappointed, I decided to wait and see what it looked like when it was finally released.  I would follow the forum from time to time just to see how things were going.  The developers always seemed interested in feedback and also seemed open to constructive comments or suggestions which was encouraging.\n\nRelease day came and I almost felt like a kid on Christmas morning.  “Please, let this game not suck because god knows how long I will have to wait for another MOM successor”, I thought.  I fired it up, and you know what?  It was a big improvement over when I played it before.  Is it perfect?  No, there are certainly things that could be better (zoom out further, city UI, and better AI…of course every strategy game in this genre could benefit from better AI).  Still, it has that hook like MOM that pulls me in and won’t let me go, and that is EXACTLY what I have been waiting for.  If you’ve played MOM, then you know what I’m talking about.  This game is not easy, and can be a bit opaque at times, but if you’re patient and take the time to uncover its layers, then you will be rewarded.  If you are on the fence about buying it right now, then I see nothing wrong with waiting for the kinks to be worked out because I’m very confident that they will be.  This game is definitely a labor of love for the developers, and they seem to care very much about it.\n\nI predict that great things are in store for Worlds of Magic, and I should know because I’m Merlin, mighty and benevolent ruler of the grey elves!  Now, if you’ll excuse me, there’s an ancient ruin over there that I need to go investigate…(just one more turn)…What?!?!

Therefore making the game boring.\n\nEarly exploration is discouraged as roaming independents will always attack and try to take over your city. As such you have to prioritize defence. This means that for the majority of the early gameplay you might as well just get a book, or watch a show while selecting things to build, and research as there's nothing to do.\n\nWhen you finally get into combat, it loads a little arena, Although unlike Age of Wonders, when defending your city you're not taken to the city. You can't man the walls, block gate, and defend a siege. It's all the same few arenas, which are all open; except for some rocks and logs here and there.\n\nDue to it's horrible slow paced gameplay, bad combat, and being unplayable on a platform they're selling it on; I simply can't recommend it. Since it's launch on Steam it's been unplayable on my Mac, and it is to this day.\n\nMaybe one day they might fix it, until then don't bother.","October 3, 2014","false","3.5"," 12 of 29 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","12","29","0","5"

Also startig troops seem to be underpowered until at least 35-50 tunrs into the game. Will give it some leeway since it is development version but really hope to see better balancing and also get like 7 fps with my comp and it is upper tier system. I have Master of Magic and play through Dos Box and it is much better as things stand now. ( miss the right click option to get more detailed info on whatver is you're looking at). Unlike many of the folks on here I find the graphics to be not appealing and borrow too heavily from other modern games in the genre *cough* Fallen Enchantres *cough*.

I was very excited by the screenshots and other reviews; I love turn based strategy games; I've been an avid Civilization fan for years (up until they nerfed the franchise with Civ V).  The gameplay is kind of like a basic version of Civilization (city management) with turn based 4X battles and a healthy dose of RPG magic.  Although I think the game has promise, at $40, I was very disappointed; I would have returned it if I could have.  Lots of bugs; gameplay still clunky and not smooth.\n\nMy main criticisms are two fold:\n\n(1) The in-game information is severly lacking, leading you to kind of guess at what you're doing, especially without a tutorial.  For example,\n*In the world creation screen, you have to select spells, but they never tell you what the spell actually does, e.g., +1 damage, or +1 health.  You have to pick them based on a vague description (or prior knowledge).\n*During gameplay, certain tiles offer "bonuses" like Civilzation, but you have no idea what they do or why you would need them.\n*When in a tactical battle, you don't know how many action points are left for any given unit or the mana cost of certain unit spells.\n*On the info screen for all your cities, data would be much easier to access if displayed in a big table: cities in rows and data types in columns, instead it's displayed in a cumbersome graphic.\n*Before you build units, you don't know what their attack/defense powers are.  There's no in-game tech tree, so I don't know what researching one spell will lead to.\n*Upkeep cost on spells is buried in info screen; it should be on the spell graphic somewhere easily accessible at a glance.\n*The city view screen is a nice view of the town, but doesn't give me any useful in game info: I'd rather it take up less screen real estate and make it easier to access what my city can build.  I don't need a "producing" and "queue" tab in city screen: collapse them and offer the number of turns till finished on same screen.\n\n(2) The actions and/or information you're typically going after are buried beneath too many button clicks or hard to manage sliders.\n*You can convert gold into mana on the Alchemy tab, but it needs a + and - button to increment by units and not just drag back and forth, or be able to type a number.\n*You are able to convert "power" generated by temples/shrines into mana/research, but shifting between mama/spellcraft/research is SO annoying: trying to put extra power in specific spots isn't easy.\n*This game NEEDS keyboard commands.\n*When in the city build screen, I have to click on a button to see that buildings I can build in a pop up screen, and yet antoher to see what units I could build.\n\nFinally, there are some elements of the game they haven't quite thought through: For example, in character creation, you can chose a "bad trait," such as a gold storage cap, that will give you more 2 skill points; however, you can also chose the "alchemist" trait which allows you to freely convert mana into gold and vice versa at a cost of only one skill point.  Since you can convert for free, you might as well "store" your gold as mana and get the free skill point in the beginning.  Of course, if you can freely convert between the two "currencies," why have two of them?  It's just annoying.","September 15, 2014","false","6.4"," 9 of 26 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","9","26","0","4"

The last game I played I got 40 turns in, 50 maybe? Then that bug popped up. It has ended every game I've played but that was the longest one.\n\nAdditionally, there's an issue sometimes where a unit will be one square away from its destination and attempting to direct the unit there creates a path through a nearby square with a hill in it, or where the unit simply can't traverse terrain it already walked over. These last two issues look for all the world like someone at your end has a basic misunderstanding of A*. Mixing this in with the mouse pointer not accurately matching up with the map grid, so there'll be grid squares that literally can't be selected. The overworld map process becomes an exercise in frustration.\n\nThere's no way to back out of the "interact" menu when a unit is standing on a dungeon or something, but because of the poor map selection it's really easy to get in there when you don't want to.\n\nCan move the viewport by hitting the top, left or right of the screen with the mouse, but can't go down? Minor but poor, this is the sort of thing that needs to be working before a game even has assets.\n\nBeyond this there are a ton of small bugs and minor irritations in other aspects of the gui, lots of them due to poor design choices. Like other games in Early Access I expect many of them will be ironed out over time.\n\nI would strongly recommend people avoid dropping $40 on this, it's not playable at present.","September 14, 2014","false","6.5"," 11 of 33 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","11","33","0","7"

Despite tooltips and some minor tutorial help I still found it very hard to grasp the initial concepts of it. I had the game crash during the battle screen before my soldiers had even appeared on the battlefield, crashes while it was trying to load up a small map with 2 players.\nThe idea of the heroes is appealing, being able to change the circles of spells and magic to your bidding, although some more detailed information as to what they do would be much better. I.E. if you have a spell that lowers attack, how much? is it a percentage? or an ammount? is it going to be worthwhile using it on this unit with a lower attack or a more powerful unit where there is less of them?  by adding statistics it helps you strategise more throughout your game and there was none of that here. Even with the map view where you can cast spells over the towns and areas to increase your food supply.\nIt always left the question, how do I know its going to be worth it? Also with the troops side of things, i found it hard to get my head around the resources, yes we have good tooltips on what they do. But a small mission to tell you what to build initially would be helpful to give you a basic understanding of the upkeep system so as not to end up buying lots of troops only to have them dissapear. Seems a bit odd.\nIt helps to have played this kind of game before, with the big map exploration techniques, but then again we have to remember that most games start off in their rather unglamourous stages before we can experience the completed article. And although I appreciate the efforts put into a game of this volume, for the price tag, its a rip off. I did ask and got declined for a refund. The sheer frustration of trying to play overpowers the enjoyment of getting lost in a fantasy world.","September 13, 2014","false","1.7"," 15 of 43 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","15","43","0","9"

By this time, players should be well aware that Early Access means game is in development.  If you are interested in a fully realized strategy game, head on over the Civ or Fallen Enchantress and come back to this one another day.  Because it is Early Access, there's no need to point out that it is unfinished or buggy in spots, that's a given.\n\nAs a long-time strategy game player, there are certain things I like to see.\n\nFirst, the strategy map.  Player's spend a lot of time here, so what's it like?  WoM's map is beautiful with a variety of unique location icons that are precise and well realized.  These add a defnite charm to the game and make exploring more than just a goody hut hunt.   Armies on the map are represented by one large unit icon with individual animations that again adds charm and interest.  The unit flags are easily seen, with good crisp colors and devices on them.  You'll never be wondering which faction an army belongs to.  Expect standard features, such are tile descriptions and bonus resources for cities.   To sum up here, this is one of the best strategy maps I have played on.\n\nNext, the city screen.   The visuals of the city screen are superb.  I very much like the framing style, which strongly suggests a medieval city.  There's a large central field that shows your city as it grows from a few houses to a large, robust city.  Management of population is straightforward and unfussy.  Perks are clear.   Current build options are clear and may be queued.  You can rename your cities and move easily from one to the next.  What's not to like?  Well, a couple of things.  When a negative event effects a city, you can't tell what it is or how long it will last.  You receive a strategy level notice when it occurs, and then it is gone.  I found this disconcerting.  If there is high unrest in my cities due to an event, I want to know that and not spend time building happiness buildings I dont' need and won't impact the event-causing unhappiness.   Likewise, if my income is inflated due to an event, I want to know that as well.   As simple as the daily income of food, gold and research is, I also found it confusing when compared to the overall gold, food and research and couldnt' get the two to correlate, even with just one city.  I finally decided to completely ignore this and just look at the overall pluses or negatives.  For those who really like to  manage to the fraction, this aspect of city management might not be satisfactory.   This is definitely an aspect of the city screen that could use some greater explanation or tool tips.  Lastly, there is no list of completed buildings.  I'm not sure this is required, but is convenient.  To sum up, the visual style and lay out of the city screen is excellent, but missing some of the information I generally like to see.\n\nLastly, combat.  I don't expect combat in a strategy game like this to be a top priority.  This isn't Total War.  I often don't have time to fight evey battle and so the AI auto-resolve is important.   Auto-resolve works fairly well here, winning obvious battles and taking appropriate damage.  Units can heal after battle, even out of territory.  On my combat map, I missed being about to rotate the map. Rocks, for instance, can obscure your view of enemies.  I found the initial set up stages confusing.  The battlemap in is need of a few more tooltips or an initial tutorial to describe the set up phases.  Other than that, battle proceeds as you expect, with exchange of blows, special powers being cast, and so forth.\n\nMy overall impression is very favorable.  I'd like to see more information on the city screen at this stage and better explanation of the opening phases on the battlemap.  Still, the improvements in the past few months have pushed the game up the playabilty scale.   The overall design is top notch, the strategy and city screens extremely well realized.   Definitely one to keep on your list.\n\nEdit on December  21, 2015\n\nI've come back a year later and find the game in only slightly better condition than a year ago.  While a year ago the game looked promising and some of it's idea exciting, it's unfortunately has not progressed to a point where the game is actually enjoyable.  Consequently, I am sad, as many others are, not to be able to recommend this game.\n\nInterface\n\nThe interface, while still as beautiful as before, just doesn't get the job done.  It is not easy to move between units and cities.  The building list in cities isn't done very intuitively; you have to look really hard to find the tiny arrow that let's you go to the next page.  The Escape key doesn't work on anything, so you need to constantly go to the bottom right-hand radial to move between game elements or even to save your game.  In other words, you have to fight the interface every step of the way to play the game.\n\nCombat\nAs before, with a 4x game, you can't expect Total War, but combat here has a  couple of problems, including the terrible combat sounds and the lack of animation to show attacks.  You hear a sound and then numbers rise up indicating damage and then some of your units fall over.  There is simply no comparison to Sorcerer King's combat, which is the closest I can come to in terms of developer intent.  And it is not even in the same category as Endless Legends.\n\nGameplay\nThis is where I think the most trouble lies.  If the gameplay were better, other issues would be balanced out or overlooked.\n\nThe most exciting part of the game is the set up.  Deciding your magic spheres, your race, your sorcerer, your spells.  This is where you see the game's possibilities.   But then you're on the map, and you have your few starting units.  The first thing you discover is that you don't have enough resources to build any more units.  So you take out your starting units and find out that with the exception of a few abandoned caravans, everything around you has guardians significantly higher than you and  your crappy level 1 units.  You wander the map looking for roamers to attack to try to level up, while you stockpile enough gold to be able to build some more units.\n\nThe mechanics of the gold/food/mana/research are fine, they just aren't robust enough.  There's no where to see what your actual empire-wide gold expense is.  You can only view it city by city.   Moreover, rebels arise, sapping both your food and your productions capabilites, very early in the game, far earlier than you have any ability to deal with them.  You are stuck with either having rebellious, food eating citizens, or dropping your taxes down to where you have no gold income and need to build Trade to keep your army from deserting.   So while you are aimlessly roaming the map looking for someway to level your troops so that you can actually play, you have to watch out for your own citizens destroying your economy.\n\nThis adds up to a lot of unfun game time.  Many of these issues could be solved with better balance on the strategic map, more lower level ruins to explore and more low-level roamers to fight allowing you to build up your army and cranking down the city unrest so that you have a good sense of the game play before you have to deal with economy problems.   Again, the closest comparison I can think of is Fallen Enchantress/Sorcerer King, which provides many opportunities for you to find loot and level your troops, while exploring the map and dodging real trouble.\n\nOne last note, I could not get crafting to work.  I attempted to craft a ring, which should have taken 7 turns, but at the end of 20, it still had not crafted.  Moreover, there was no indication of when the game thought it would be crafted, so I simply deleted it from the queue, which did not restore any resources, but did allow my mana to start building.","December 7, 2014","false","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The game got worse. I truly had high hopes for this game. Personally I guess it will be abandoned by the "developers' shorty.\n\n1-- Most if not every PROFESSIONAL review i saw of the game gives it very poor grades. They try to be nice (as it is a Kick starter project allegedly, and it is is the successor to MoM)\n2-- It does one thing better than MoM, one..... It introduces 8 planes instead of 2.\n3-- Virtually everything else is much worse than MoM. Now keep in mind MoM had many glitches and bugs, until it was abandoned and the "mod community" made their OWN patch. This fixed 95% of the problems. Hopefully the same happens here.\n4-- The steam forums for this game are a joke. I am of the opinion many of the posts are developer employees scamming comments. a typical 'bug complaint' goes like this. "hey guys, great game, but sometimes when I research spell XYZ i notice the graphic doesnt show up as completed. Other than that, Awesome game", the devs OFFICIALY reply "hmm thanks for pointing that out, we will take a look at that now, thanks for the heads up and we are glad you enjoy the game".   (I saw about 50-100 posts near exact like this.) HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA\na Real post would be like the ones that get deleted, or are in the REVIEWS listed here " umm. I cant play Undead, literaly i have tried 11 games. and within 1 hour to 4 hours in the game, it gets corrupted and unplayable.   UNPLAYABLE", or "how is this game released. it has so many game crashes, it has such horrible grammar, missing icons, WRONG Descriptions (really.... shambling mound STILL SAYS it regenerates???? really????)  and the AI is the worst ive seen in a game since 1981."\n5-- Speaking of the crashes. There will be many and often. Usually during the ONE battle u cant "auto fight" to get out of. (though they are few. since the AI is a ♥♥♥♥♥). U will fight this battle. be 8 minutes in... CRASH... (well the game gets stuck. u have to alt tab. and close. then restart). This awesome feature means you will LITERALLY save the game every 2 turns. Because once the game gets fun, you will be battling a lot. and thus crashing often. So better save.. and Hope that save doesnt get corrupted. (yes the saves get corrupted rarely).\n6-- AI... Oh my lord. I love strategy games, but am not a god at them. I would say i can beat most on average the first or second game. and then move up to the level before "deity" or "ultra hard" by my fifth game....  I never beat Deity (for example) without exploits, or an uber team.   ( example: play Life, and have TORIN in MoM... equals instant win, with no skill whatsoever) This game is so bad, the AI opponents Dont survive.... Yes read that again. THEY DONT SURVIVE on their own.\nNow some of you may have read the fake post some dude put in forums "hey guys this is my turn 104 game. notice I have every city, all spells, all spell circles.. etc.."   HAHAHAH right kid.. RIght...\nThis game starts spawning Roaming Monsters. and guess what, they hit citys. Including the enemy. You can watch even on the hardest difficulty when u take CARTOGRAPHER skill. You see whole map and watch the Roaming monsters kill95% of the AI citys lol.... "Oh look, Orange dude is doing good, he has 7 citys... Oh dear, hes down to 5... oooops now 3. I better make an army and go kill some before they are all NEUTRAL, and i can steal them with a Magic Spirit...."\nI could write forever. Basically this game is a joke. There is no skill involved. and the AI is far far worse than MoM was back in 1990 or whenever it came out. a 10 year old kid can beat this on hardest level, with Skeletons, Spirit, and Spearman. (bah just skeletons... WIN whole game. )\n7- Move.. The game was made for Multiplayer (hahah) so they try to balance. I wonder how many people play dwarves. They move ONE square per turn. ONE.. maybe... if theyre lucky. what a boring boring race. Have fun playing and moving ONE SQUARE.  Even the Draconians which can move up to 5... FLYING.. really move about 2-3.  SO on any map above medium u spend hours just walking. UGH. And as to balance. It makes every army feel the exact same. (in MoM trolls regen, dark elves shot magic, dwarves were super tough.. etc) not here. Balance means all armys equally lame.\n8-- The game forces u to do the lamest battles ever. Remember i said, "only play on hardest level" well it wont help. You can attack a city with 6 spearman defenders and a wall. with 16 DOOMDRAKES (flying, most powerful normal unit in game.) and u will retreat. ( apparently they can fly over walls when u control them, but not on AUTO fight. (same with spiders that climb walls, or the way those 6 spearman kill your catapult, when u have 15 DOOMdrakes protecting.)\n9-- all in all, its a poor ripoff of MoM, it does nothing new, and nothing better except more planes. (which most are bugged.... too long to write how). the UI, the AI, all worse...\nDont buy.... DO NOT BUY\n\n\n\nFIrst Review:......(condensed)..................................................................................................................\nThis game is beta. or alpha.. or early acess. NUFF SAID.  Do not embarrass the gaming community by posting a negative review based on a bug or glitch. etc..\n\nAnyway, My thoughts upon hearing of this game were " yeah, heard that before" when it comes to "Masters of Magic" Spiritual Successor.  Many of you know what im talking about, and based on the reviews, and forum posts. YOU CARE about MoM, and if this game is like it. Well I played the game. and I can offer some Early opinions.\n\n1-- MoM is rated number 1 strategy game in many many peoples minds, and on NUMEROUS strategy game sites. Feel free to google Master of Magic and read the reviews.\n2-- MoM was broken. Plain and simple. It had goofy AI, it didnt play on 90% of peoples machines when it came out, or later. without tweaking the DoS files.. etc.. You could " beat the game" with a certain strategy every time "Hint: Get Torin". Yet the 'fun' in that game and replayabilty was out of this world. Which is why so many of us strategy gamers still love it. (I personally think the Strategy guide was the best strat guide book ever published. IM not exaggerating lol. Even it was Fun to read.)\n\nNow to WoM "Worlds of Magic"\nIt is DEFINITELY the successor to MoM. Without a doubt the Closest based on MECHANICS and GAMEPLAY that I've ever seen. Nothing else comes close. Not Age of Wonders, Not Enchantress. Nothing. Even in this early alpha u can see how similar the games will be.\nFor instance...\nThe races are unique. Not just a new graphic with same rock paper scissors this troop beats that troop. Each Race (so far) has unique attributes that seem to follow the path MoM did. I am hoping (praying) that Dark Elves come in..... and they have something like the "ranged magic". It really separated them from the humans and their first strike magic immune paladins for example.\nThere are multiple planes. Much like Myrrhan and Normal.. Here you have MORE than just two. I cant wait to see if certain races are unique to only certain plains etc..\nYou can craft Magic Items\nYou have a diverse collection of Tile upgrades (remember those Mythral and Adamantium tiles in MoM, you could jack up your Halfling slingers with??? muhoohahaahaha)\nThe spells are varied\nThe spell schools are varied\nSummoning can be viable early, and a good strategy\nYou can acquire "more" spell "books" by hitting 'dungeons" etc... So far i havent found a skill "such as alchemy" but it doesnt mean it isnt there or wont be.  I loved that I could pick all spell books and "find" all other skills (or many) with hitting NODES.. in MoM. This game appears to have the same mechanics\nThe battlefield is Similar. Squares u move around, Turn Based. Etc.\nAll in all. That seems to sum up most of the things that set MoM apart. And this game is on the right track in matching or exceeding those expectations","October 31, 2014","false","252.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
