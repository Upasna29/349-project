While the classes and builds make for a bit of intrigue you'll quickly be mired in repetition as you clear room after room without much to distinguish each one from the last. In typical crawler fashion the game is broken into three acts each capped by an uninspiring boss encounter. The game also features an incredibly frustrating lack of responsiveness from the controls. Attempts to pivot and free fire are often ignored as you find yourself running directly into damage(and often death) instead. While it had the potential to be a good title there just isn't enough there to warrant the time commitment and achievement collectors will also be disappointed at the absence of any. Unless you are a die hard fan of the genre or have a fetish for poor controls I'd suggest spending your time elsewhere.","December 2, 2013","false","57.8"," 73 of 95 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","73","95","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendansebire/recommended/46400/","brendansebire","B-Dawg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendansebire/","667 products in account","Firstly, please note that my "hrs on record" is wrong because I play with Steam in Offline mode. I have finished the game and played all three characters up to the point where all their skills are unlocked.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, so I wanted to offer an alternative view to all the negative reviews here! Firstly I think this game is pretty clearly inspired by Space Siege. This is perhaps a rather questionable choice in inspirations, but Greed is a much better game because it has character classes with skill trees for each.\n\nThe game has things that may grate with a new player. Enemies can be real bullet sponges. Level features are reused often enough that levels can seem a bit long-winded. Also items aren't randomised much at all and you will see the same armor and weapons repeatedly. Damage numbers on weapons you find are too low early in the game. Each character class is restricted to their weapon type (gatling gun, long range plasma rifle or flamethrower).\n\nAfter experimenting with the different classes and looking over all the skills I decided to make a character based around maximizing my ability to spam my skills. (Skill damage increase with character level unlike weapon damage.) I did this first with the flamethrower guy and it was great fun! The fire effects in the game are excellent. The flames, smoke and burning sound effects combined with the ability to set large sections of the screen on fire was very entertaining. One of the top level skills is a long range flamethrower effect that reminds me of John Carpenter's The Thing. Making heavy use of skills made playing this character more like a fire mage.\n\nAfter finishing the game the first time, I went back and played as the long range character and she also has some pretty entertaining skills. I appreciate that the game rewards a bit of planning about how you're going to build your character with some fun (albiet repetitive) action. So for all it's flaws, I still really enjoyed this game.\n\nThe game also does a bad job of communicating some important information. Useful tips for someone starting the game:\nIf your mouse is laggy go into the graphics settings and disable Post Render.\nMake sure Highlight is enabled in graphics settings. It will help you find interactable containers.\nIn the Inventory screen, click the icon near your currency count then click on an item to scrap it. This turns the item into scrap which sells for less then the item, but stacks and only takes a single inventory space.\nAfter you get to Act 2, an icon appears in the bottom right hand corner of your Inventory screen that lets you teleport back to the shop once every 5 minutes.\nLeave skill points unallocated until you find a save point, then buy new skills and test them. If you don't like them, just reload to get the points back.\nEnjoy!","August 6, 2014","true","0.4"," 58 of 74 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","58","74","0","0"

Everything you love about the Diablo games, or Torchlight, or Titan Quest/Grim Dawn has been toned down quite a bit here. Not as many classes or skills or equipment options. I haven't even run into any side quests yet. So, in essence, this is a poor man's sci-fi version of Diablo. However.... this is a poor man's SCI-FI version of Diablo. Fighting robots and mutants and aliens on spaceships and distant worlds is a very cool idea for this genre. The graphics aren't super great but they certainly aren't bad either. I am enjoying them just fine. And the soundtrack is techno and rock. Great music to blast enemies away to. The bottom line is, if you're a Diablo/Torchlight/Titan Quest fan and you find this game on sale, I recommend picking it up. The sci-fi theme and techno music alone make this a worthwhile buy for us action RPGers.","February 25","true","17.8"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/recommended/46400/","doomsdayforte","DF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/","936 products in account","I bought got this in the Indie Gala 3 bundle several years ago and only now got around to playing it.  It took me almost ten hours to get to the end of Normal difficulty using the Marine.  Ctrl+F "TL;DR" if you don't wanna read all this.\n\nBefore I start, I'll say two things:  First, I'm going to make reference to the Diablo series quite a bit here.  The second is that this is a not-recommended review because I didn't really enjoy it, not because of any particular flaws.\n\nGreed: Black Border is Diablo in Space.  You explore a set map for each area, you fight enemies, you get drops, you make money, you level up and get better skills.  You start by taking your pick of three classes:  The close-range Pyro-Soldier, the mid-range Marine, and the long-range Plasma-Engineer.  Starting with a story sequence, now you're on a large ship and you have to go free your own little ship from impound.  And on the way, you fight zombies and robots.  Later on, you're in a desert area fighting desert critters, and finally you're in a cave fighting robot bugs.\n\nGameplay is fairly simple.  Isometric view, you have a minimap in the corner, left-click to move, left-click enemy to attack, Shift+click to attack without moving.  All of the classes are in some way ranged with the Pyro being the one most likely to get into a close-ranged fight and the Plasma sniping everything from afar.  You're gonna do a lot of kiting.  All classes have a regenerating shield, a set amount of health that doesn't regenerate by default, and an energy bar to fuel special moves.  There's also a regenerating bar for dodge-rolls with WASD or the spacebar, though you aren't immune to damage during them.  Not being able to spam dodge-rolls sorta harms their effectiveness since you don't exactly get very far away in the process.\n\nAll classes have skill trees.  Raise one skill, unlock another, that sorta thing.  What is interesting is that apart from your basic attack, you can have an active right-click skill, a passive offensive skill, and a passive defensive skill all equipped at the same time, so it's a matter of figuring out which ones are good and then dumping your skill points into them since unequipped skills obviously don't work unless equipped.\n\nI wouldn't say it's a lootfest like the Diablo games.  Sure, gear and money drop, but there aren't any magic items.  You find gear that your class can equip only, but only basic things drop.  This means that for the most part, the better stuff you find is just numerically better overall, nothing really different other than appearance, and there was no variety in weapon types.  For the Marine, the only weapons I found were miniguns and I imagine the same situation applies to the other classes.  You can add affixes and traits to items by putting in socketables, though there still isn't a very big variety of effects, mostly +X energy or maybe +X a set of skills or +X% damage.  It took me until near the end of Normal just to find gear that had affixes already applied to them!  At least everything shows up on your character.\n\nThere's a store, but you don't get access to it until maybe halfway through the first chapter.  You get a device that lets you warp to him every five minutes, though his stock doesn't really update often.  You can recycle your gear for a pretty generous return on money and a chance at making a new socketable, though I ultimately felt that money didn't have much point.  I never felt like I had to save up money for something good, just that anything good the shop had I'd buy since I had more than enough anyway.\n\nMaps are huge, like, they'll take you an hour for each one or so.  There's no randomization here, and there are some puzzle elements, like reading a note and then using the numbers to get through a code console, or navigating over the safe spots on a damaging floor.  There aren't many of these elements, though.  A rather big problem I had was that this game only saves by checkpoints.  And you have to manually walk up to one to save your game.  It's very possible to just forget to activate one and lose several minutes of play.  Or in an area where they're not common, lose time anyway when you die.  I didn't find a way to scroll the minimap though I actually didn't get lost at all.  There's only one running speed and outside of the final areas, no way to get around the map than just regular moving.  There didn't seem to be any backtracking either, not that there was a good reason to back somewhere.\n\nI didn't keep count, but I think there were maybe 30 varieties of enemies to fight.  Like dropped gear, they didn't have any really remarkable traits, so you either fought the garden-variety mook or its upgraded version.  There were bosses at the end of the three chapters at least, but each chapter was filled with cutting through a slog of the same enemies.  They weren't very interesting, just a few long-ranged ones you could easily tank or evade and a lot of melee ones that you could easily kite.  Granted, I did die a few times though it was more to environmental hazards/puzzles than enemies up until the final chapter.  Watch out for those Gun Drone Overlords.\n\nThere isn't much for plot.  You answer a distress call for a mining ship and your ship gets impounded, then you crash onto a planet and have to find fuel cells.  That's basically it.   There is quite a bit of world-building done given the story with the five colonies and you even get little news bulletins from the outside world as you play, though they're ultimately pointless, like finding the history books in the first Diablo.  The setting is nice, a Diablolike that isn't a high-fantasy world but future space sci-fi and all.  And of course the game ends on a sequel hook cliffhanger and nothing's probably gonna happen on that front.  There is voice acting, though that too's not very remarkable.  Your character makes some comments during the game but for the Marine, they were almost impossible to hear or understand, even after fiddling with the sound options.\n\nTL;DR:  I don't know.  Greed isn't a bad game, it's just not good.  It's average.  Underwhelming.  The things it does, other games do better.  The game gave me zero issues like crashing or bugs or whatever, but I just didn't really enjoy my time with it.  At least it's kinda pretty.\n\nI'd say unless it was like 90% off, you can probably avoid this.  It's still too bad, since it feels like the first episode in a longer game and there was nothing wrong with it outside of it not being remarkable.  I might be convinced to go back and try Hard Mode for a little while though I have a feeling it's gonna be more of the same.","November 15, 2014","false","9.8"," 38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","38","47","0","0"

Greed: Black Border is about as mechanical as games can get. The pieces all fit together perfectly but somehow someone forgot to add some soul and some heart.\n\nAs far as story and plot go, Greed makes do with as little as possible on which to hang its gaming framework so don't expect any Machiavellian plot twists or just plain good old storytelling. Graphics and audio design are serviceable although the voice acting is atrocious and the script generally very poorly written. It plays and sounds very much like Sci-Fi B movie.\n\nIf you have played any action RPG since Diablo you'll know exactly what to expect. Click and then click some more and then stock up on what ever loot pops out of your enemies carcass. Clockstone obviously don't really understand the fundamentals of the hack and slash RPG - namely gear and inventory. Here you get an inventory that can hold only a few items and items are indistinguishable from the others when viewing them but different by name only  so this ensures that your character will look exactly the same as he or she looked right at the beginning of the game.\n\nThe game also struggles to forge an inlay into the cannon that is the science-fiction themed action RPG, of which to be honest there isn't one standout game (Space Siege anyone?). But that does not mean its a terrible game, only a very mediocre one. There is still some fun to be had here, if you can get past the lack of good storytelling, terrible voice work, shoddy inventory system and some boss battles that will try even the hardcore gamers patience.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","November 18, 2013","true","33.8"," 45 of 61 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","45","61","0","4"

Simply awful. What originally started as a sort of simple dungeon crawler with a little charm to it, quickly became a nightmare with each moment grinding against what little patience I had left. The first chapter is fine, nothing special, completely tolerable. Once the second chapter, OF THE THREE CHAPTERS IN THE GAME, began, a lot of glaring issues began to emerge. First of all, controlling your character is broken. Simply broken. Your soldier will randomly stop, start, run in circles, fire at nothing, or just flat out kill himself. The characters themselves have less personality than generic sodas, and the class balance is absurd. The experience curve is ridiculous, requiring multiple playthroughs to "catch up" to the zones you wish to clear. Fortunately, you don't even need to care, as most of the enemies are easily bypassed by just running, assuming your character doesn't have a stroke. The shopkeeper must be a mythological creature, because I've only seen him in photos making out with bigfoot. Item "customization" is non-existent, with actual equipment being an afterthought. Skills have no weight and don't even feel like they do anything (except the nuke, which HAHA kills teammates). Co-operative play requires jumping through hoops to get a lobby to function. The game looks muddy, seems like it was made around 2001 but plays like something you would have bought for MS-DOS. The bosses are, to be frank, stupid. The checkpoint system lets you zerg bosses by simple resetting from checkpoint. I got this game for $0.49 during a steam sale when it seemed like a steal. But at this point, I would have rather bought 49 gumballs and choked to death. This is not a game that can even be enjoyed with friends who are just goofing around. If you feel like learning what being lynched feels like, grab this game from your local dumpster. It's probably in the one thats on fire, since only Satan incarnate would own this game to keep in his torture pits. Play Path of Exile instead, it's free and doesn't make me feel like I'm eating a truck's tire with a bendy straw.","April 4, 2014","false","5.3"," 39 of 52 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","39","52","0","3"

End review.\n\n... INVENTORY TETRIS! :D\n\n...\n\n\nNo, seriously though, Greed: Black Border is fairly good, in spite of some of the horrid reviews it has received. It's an isometric sci-fi action game with RPG-lite elements.\n\nYou get to choose one of three characters to respond to a distress call from a mining ship. Each has a different set of abilities, passives and combat style.\n\nThe presentation is pretty good. The graphics are definitely more than adequate for the game, with decent character modeling and particle effects for weapons and abilities. I REALLY like the interface. The general gameplay interface, the character, skills, logbook and shop interfaces are all well thought out, clean and easily accessible.\n\nI played the long range character, and the actives and passives on offer seem to provide quite a few different playstyle options. So far I have opted for mostly relying on my range, though it seems as if she could be played in significantly closer quarters for those more brave. I can only imagine the capabilities of the other two. However the equipment options are rather paltry, with only head, chest and weapon slots available, though each slot has a selection of mods that can be socketed into them to add stats or boost your abilities/passives.\n\nThere is a decent variety of enemies. Just on the first map, I encountered several varieties of machine and humanoid enemies, all of which were well designed. Speaking of the map, the maps are HUGE. It took me three hours just to clear the first mission. THREE! And the final boss was just madness.\n\nThe audio. Oh god the audio. The game's music is awful. The music is really arcadey, and it's on a short loop that it gets annoying very quickly. I shut it off and played my own after about 15 minutes. The voice acting I have seen so far is passable, though, but nothing to write home about.\n\nOnly real complaints about the game are no gamepad support, and somewhat obtuse controls. With some time learning you get used to them, but it takes a significant amount of time to do so.\n\nOverall, Greed: Black Border is a decent ARPG for the asking price. There are better out there, but there are also FAR worse.

The mix is both interesting and frustrating.\n\nGRAPHICS\nThe game is not processor heavy. Only 12-15% is required from an Intel i7-4770k CPU and 31-41% from an NVidia 770 running at 536 MHz. Backgrounds aren't as pretty, and aside from the frequent explosive canisters from earlier levels, there aren't much to interact from the environment, nor it is purposeful.\n\nSOUND\nMost of the interactions (walking on different surfaces, downed enemy, broken tables, plants shot at) are paired with sound effects. The soundtrack isn't interesting, and I got tired from hearing the same (or similar) electronic music by the middle of the game.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe story is short. Enemies, gear, and environments don't have much variety. Add all that and you have what I feel like a grinding game. Controls are also an issue, specially considering how hard it is navigating traps via point and click controls. The control scheme is just inappropriate for this type of gameplay. Rogue style controls will feel better for the mazes and overall gameplay. And, too bad, rogue style control is  not an option in GBB.\n\nOVERALL\nI did finish the game without complaining much. I did find it weird that the player can only have one passive offensive perk and one passive defensive perk active at a time. For $0.70, it's ok. Buy it.

And also the big variants of those. The action is just you standing in place, shooting things, running away for a bit to get some distance, shooting more, running away a bit more, etc. Enemies trigger when you open a room or get close enough. Some enemies are sleeping and only wake up when you just about step on them. They don't take damage until they wake up.\n\nThere is some worldbuilding, but nothing is really done with it. There's also bits of voice acting, but they're for exciting plot points like finding an elevator to get to the next area. Then an hour of nothing as you slog through the level, plugging boring drones and boring zombies that have somehow gotten chainsaws for hands, searching for the thing that will end this godforsaken level.\n\nI could feel my will to live draining with every minute I played this.

That is my personal opinion.\n\nIn general, the game is a Diablo-style with ranged-space-weapons, as you can see from various internet sources. It has a slower pace than the manster-mob-madness of diablo, thus being a bit 'slower' on action. It also incloudes a few of simple wriddles.\n\nThe first impression of the game is its worst enemy:\n1st: You start at levels with repeated and slow enemies.\n2nd: All the items you find at the beging look alike, with only difference a minimum change at the statistics. All the weapons look like they have the same grafic model. At the begining, I thought that the game was a low-budget that has nothing to do with 'dressing-up' your character. I was also wandering why the developers bothered to make a rotating-3d-model of your character at the inventory screen, since there was no reason for more than one admiring-look to my avatar.\n3ed: Your skill tree does not look interesting, neither 'grafically' nor in the essence of the skills.\n\nI was ready to quit, but I had read in a review that the game gets better later on. (I can not track down the review now, to give thangs and credit to the writer :-( ... )\n\nAnd now I am glad that I didn't quit on the game.\n\nAfter you find the trader, the 'feeling' gets much better and I got some fun playing the game.\nThere is a bit better variety of items, even thow not as mach as i would like. I can justify it considering the 'game world setting: Industrialised, standardised production.\nThe enemies have now a variety of forms and tactics (there are also crubs that dig-hid in the ground and attack you from  below with spike-claws). Even if they are not so intriguing like diablo-2.\nThe setting and feeling of the game now is rewarding, and the more relaxed-slow pace regarding to Diablo, now looks to be part of the game experience, completly in harmony with the game setting, not frustating me any more.\n\nI define the game slow-paced, becouse there are usually a few enemies but with many HitPoints each. The Marine character I tried most, will aways need a second or two to finish a standard enemy... Not frustrating any more for me, but definetly something that could tire sombody out of the game.\n\nOne more negative factor still in place after 2-3 map-areas is that once you add an upgrade module at a weapon-armor you can not remove it to replace with a better one. This is constantly frastrating, and i can only bare it becouse at normal difficulty the upgrades boosts dont look so crusial.\n\nIn general, I am having fan with the game (mostrly after meeting the trader and landed on the first planet). If you have not played Titan Quest or Diablo 2, you should keep your money for those two gems of gaming. If you have been througth the fabulouse hack-&-slash games in your collection, and are looking for a new one with a space-mashine-gun setting, then Greed Black Border is a good option, surely worthing 4 or 5 euros for the hours of funny, relaxing bulletstorm it can offer.\n\nConsidering that the game is not a big one (it took me about 15 gameplay hours to complete all the three game areas), and that personally I don't feel intrigued to start a second replay with an other character class emediately, I would recommend the game, rating it as 3/5.\n\nEdit: I read in some reviews about broken control of your character... I have not yet ecnounter any control issues, regardless that i have rearange the key-commands to my liking...

Effectively, when Greed is good, it is very very good.\n\nThis only serves to make the multiple difficulty spikes (actually never mind spikes, cliffs), poorly thought out mobs and insanely cheap sudden deaths all the more frustrating and hard to forgive. The boss fights are next to impossible, and many of the higher level enemies can almost instantly kill you from off screen. Enemies at times seem to shoot you with their highest damage attack from the end of a corridor across an entire map, and in general, the game really forces you to save every time you kill something or suffer the consequences and that really destroys your immersion. To cap this off, there is no enemy respawn or randomised encounter system to enable you to grind until you're too powerful to get cheap-shotted into oblivion during a boss fight or violated into a reload for the cardinal sin of opening the wrong flipping door.\n\nI could forgive the game suddenly going off the deep end without warning over and over if I could've run around doing the equivalent of stabbing rats until I was big and hard enough to not have to worry a la any JRPG you care to mention, but EXP is finite and levelling is painfully slow even on Easy.\n\nI don't mind hard games at all. I have two Ninja Gaiden games and around 50 bullet hells sitting in my games collection, and I've even finished a few of them. I enjoy a well put together challenge. However I cannot stand a schizophrenic, jumpstarting, spiking and above all else, cheap attempt at a challenge. Greed has no balance to it's gameplay at all, veering constantly between laughably easy and nihilistically, keyboard-punchingly difficult with next to no warning, and no amount of high performance, great music (sadly actually FANTASTIC music) or interesting ideas can save it from that one issue.\n\nIf you're a hardcore masochist, or you pee EXP and poop cure potions, this might be for you.\n\nBut for anyone who doesn't view 200 restarts on the same boss fight because it's got an instant kill homing bullet on STAGE ONE as their idea of fun, avoid.","January 30, 2015","false","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On top of that there's an almost unwinnable first boss battle, unless you know how to best build your character and be able to eat that incoming damage. Also, when I got to the next chapter, I was hoping for new opponents, but for the most part these were nothing more than a case of "same enemy type, different appearance" which is just plain lazy.\n\nSeriously, do not buy, this game is ♥♥♥♥.","August 17, 2014","false","12.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Everything is done via right clicking or left clicking.

But as a single player game it's just...mediocre.\n\nLooks beautiful, I love the lighting effects! It's shiny, It reminds me of the art direction of Star Craft... especially with how similar the Engineer looks to Nova.  Ahem.\n\nThe gameplay itself is actually pretty solid, like nothing completely glitching out on me, but then again there doesn't seem to be an excessive use of features to really screw it up.  It's a pretty basic premise.  You have short range Pyro Guy, Mid Range Marine Mini-Gun guy, Long Range I'm Not Nova GIrl.  They have skills that you can upgrade and find a combination to a play style you want to do... which ever that is I guess.\n\nThe game itself is pretty unforgiving and will take building a character a couple of times before you say "Wait a second, I should plan this out a little" and by Plan this out I mean Figure out which two passive builds I want to go with followed by which secondary move is going to work with me... otherwise your character is going to suck and die.  Get respawned.  Then Suck and die again.  Players who arn't used to that sort of mechanic will quickly either A) Lose Interest or B) Learn the hard way.\n\nYou find loot, you slot loot...like Diablo.  Or most other hack and slash games.  Most enemies are pretty straight forward though have pretty special AI.  LIke they can get stuck in corners very easily.  A good number of enemies if they lose a little bit of sight of you will just forget about you altogether.\n\nI would still recommend this game though, for one reason. Multiplayer.\n\nIt took me playing this a little while, after kiting enemies and realizing how incredibly tanky everything is and it just donned on me.  Could it be that this game was intended for Co-op?  Well... yeah actually.  3 Players, run through the game- play off eachothers strategies and inch their way to victory with a lot less kiting... A LOT LESS KITING.  Ok ok, still a decent amount of Kiting but each battle doesn't make you run back 100 meters screaming "JUST DIE ALREADY".  Granted I feel the game does try to make up for Single Player by putting explosive barrels everywhere AND thank some lord out there that the pack of zombies or robots don't seem to go into very very high numbers.\n\nSo Multiplayer is pretty much dead, so if you were hoping to catch an internet game well...good luck with that.  But don't let that stop you.  Your best bet is to wait for it to go on sale, buy two extra copies for your 2 friends that play these kind of games and say...  ARE YOU READY FOR A CHALLENGE!?!?!?!?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DynoAK/recommended/46400/","DynoAK","RenTu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DynoAK/","220 products in account","Greed: Black Border starts you off as a marine of your choice responding to a distress signal. You have a choice between three play styles right off the bat. Short range, Medium range, and Long range. My review is for the Long range character. The basics of my class were just a sniper plasma weapon with some interesting skills and passive skills. Unfortunately, the game isn't really long enough to unlock most of the skills but the ones you do unlock are fun nonetheless.\n\nThe graphics are amazing. I wouldn't say that they are very high tier but they have a nice sharp texture to them and they just look great. I haven't experienced any bugs or graphical glitches throughout my full 14 hour playthrough. I understand that steam says that I played for less time but my internet went out and I played offline. Not that any of that matters. The graphical engine is similar to Alien Swarm with less gloss.\n\nI will be the first to admit that there is little to no story in this game. So if you are looking for a wonderful and immersive story, this won't be your cup of tea. This game is more focused on the combat. Let me explain how the combat works. You move similarly to Diablo III with the whole point and click. WSAD are very much useless unless you plan to dodge roll. You can also dodge roll by pressing spacebar and you'll move in the direction your mouse is facing. The dodge roll has a cooldown, about 2.5 seconds at default if I remember correctly. In this game, for long range at least--your shield is your best friend. I added a perk that allowed me to defer some of the damage done to my shield to my energy.\n\nYou also have an energy bar which is directly tied to your skill use. For example, a ball that sucks enemies towards it and does massive damage. Something like that may cost 170 energy. In order to prevent skill spamming, this game also has a cooldown for the skill. It's not that long of a wait and it is very effective. I'm not sure if it was a common game mechanic or due to my choice in the passive skill to reduce shield damage by transferring some of it to shield--but when enemies hit me it would reset the cooldown and I'd be waiting twice as long. Not much of a problem for me being a long range character, although this may have an effect on the close range character. I haven't tested it yet.\n\nThere is a merchant in this game as there is in almost any kind of game nowadays. The merchant will sell you goods such as, in my case, different damage plasma rifles, armor, health and energy potions. They aren't really a potion but that's what it can be interpreted as. The game does lack in story as well as lootable items. The currency in game is Ikarium, a rare mineral in which enemies will drop, you'll find in lootable sources, and selling items to the merchant. As you are on the last section of the first chapter, you will discover the merchant. He will give you an item which will allow you to teleport to him and sell items. There is a 5 minute RT cooldown in which the merchant will be switching up the items he's selling. If he doesn't have the item you want then, just wait the cooldown out and check again.\n\nA few weapons and armor will have socketed items similarly to the embedded gem system in Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. I was disappointed to realize that once an item has been placed in the socketable items, they are forever embedded there. This is a silly design but it does not affect the gameplay too much. The merchant will typically sell you a small variety of the upgradable items.\n\nThe first boss that you encounter has a large pool of HP and you might find this to be very annoying. There are no checkpoints during the boss battles but they have relatively easy attacks to dodge. Just hang in there! Bosses are nowhere near as tankish th rest of the game.\n\nThere are three chapters in the game. My first chapter lasted me about five hours, second being around two, and the third being around seven. Overall not too bad. There is definitely replayability as there is new game+.\n\nThe point and click is doomed to have some issues with movement as you are not fully in control all the time with these kind of games. Although you can just hold down the mouse button to move and use your mouse to direction, it can still be annoying. Your hands will get tired while playing this game as there is a lot of clicking. The attacking will require you to left click enemies and your skill move will require you to right click. You can hold shift and click in order to attack without the risk of moving towards the enemie accidentally. It does get annoying when sometime you're attacking an enemy and you wish to retreat as they get closer to you, but the game continues to attack and you'll take a hit. This hasn't been a major deal to me as no enemies have landed a killing blow on me due this.\n\nThe health and energy "potions" can be activated in three ways: a bind(preset) Q-Health E-Energy, clicking the icon on the hud, and clicking the item via the inventory. This allows you to flow freely through combat without menus and such.\n\nThis game has an interesting set of enemies that all have different abilities. Robots, bees, scorpions, wasps, and a zombie type of character. Most of them have unique attacks. For instance, the chemist zombie will shoot some liquid out of his mouth and heal the other zombies around him. Taking him out will require the others to regenerate health slowly.\n\nAnother important thing to note is that there is no autosave in this game. There are quite a few checkpoint marks on the ground in which you must click on to save your game. It is worthwhile to travel back to an area to save as there are some cheap instant kills occasionally with puzzles and enemies.\n\nI found the key codes in the first chapter to be a very unique addition. Trying to figure out codes that were not blatantly handed to you reminded me of the game Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. Sitting there trying to read a log, or look at a piece of paper and figure out the meaning of it. I felt very interested in trying to figure out the codes myself as opposed to searching the internet for the answer.\n\nOverall, the game is not perfect. I did find it to be a bit on the shorter side due to a lack of story progression. But this game is definitely a diamond in the rough. I found it to be very fun and a total bargain. I mean, $5.00 for this game? Just that is a deal let alone the $1.00 steam sale. I would even go as far as to say I'd spend $10.00 on this game if it had more of a story. I've seen some $30.00 games or even $60.00 games that don't compete with this. Get it, play it, enjoy it. Even if you don't enjoy it, it's $5.00. It's not going to break the bank. I'm interested in playing through the game a handful more times to test the difficulties and try out the other characters.","December 28, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's as if the developers thought to themselves,\n"Hey guys, let's make a sci-fi ARPG with hardly any RPG elements, where you use the left mouse button to attack AND move! No, we can't just use WASD to move, that's for dodging! No, we can't make double-tapping dodge instead!"\nNot only am I confused as to what they DID decide to copy, but also what they DIDN'T. It's a little mind-boggling when I try to picture them sitting around, saying,\n"Remember how in Diablo II there was a RUN button? Let's not bother with that, even though we pretty much already have a stamina bar we're using for the dodgeroll. You know how Diablo is all about the LOOT? Kinda unnecessary, let's only have ONE GUN for each class, make the droprate and variety incredibly low, stuff like that."\n\nAnyways, as for my experience, I picked the Plasma class because I'm a little mad about StarCraft: Ghost being canceled, and I wanted to play as Nova.\nVery first time I leveled up, I took a look at the passive skills and found the "I WIN" mode: an ability to transfer damage taken to the energy use for skills.\nTurns out this ability straight-up made me invulnerable. I mean, I figured I'd be too busy shooting bad guys with my gun to bother with active abilities, but the energy bar replenishes so fast that it's almost hard to actually take damage to your normal shield, let alone your actual health.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is boring, the control scheme is inappropriate, and the sounds, music, story, environments and enemies aren't even worth mentioning, and I would not recommend playing this game unless you want a simple sci-fi Diabloish game to turn off your brain and play on auto-pilot.","September 13, 2014","false","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It isn't good enough to even be considered a bad Diablo.\nBut it's cheap (it cost me a little over 1 €), it's reasonably fun and it can give you some good times before you finish it or become tired of it. Definitely a recomendation if you have nothing else to play.","June 4, 2013","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's better for newcomers to the genre than for those experienced with Diablo, Torchlight, Titan's Quest etc.  It has a fairly simple equipment, experience and skill system that won't feel overwhelming.  You can't make too many big mistakes building a character if you just plan ahead a little.  The sci-fi setting is a nice and unusual touch, though the plot is bare-bones.\n\nSome people have complained that the game is buggy but I haven't noticed any major problems.\n\nIt supports multiplayer and it might make for a better experience than single player.  Total time to complete the campaign on Normal difficulty is a little over 10 hours.","April 4","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The whole game feels soooo slow\n\nWhile the graphics aint bad, this was supposed to be an isometric shooter with fast action and mobs but instead you can feel yourself crawling on each level, the same formula, different enemies and instead of fast action (like zombie shooter or other similar titles) this one moves so... damn... slowly!\n\nThe controls are awful, why limit yourself to move only with the mouse? You can only use WASD to do a quick dodge and the wait for it to reload, htis is so damn unnecesary, if you where to move with WASD and just aim with the mouse this would become so much simpler.\n\nIts such a task of a game that is not worth it.","April 29","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's supposed to be a traditional action RPG, but in space with guns, but the control scheme it has means you can't move and shoot at the same time. This results in you standing still while clicking on enemies, misclicking, moving, trying to click again, and so on. It screams to let you move and shoot, like every other top-down game with guns.\n\nAdd a lack of interesting character building, dark and dull graphics, tactically boring enemies, and you have no reason to play this dreck.","May 21","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
