To everyone else, avoid it. Run. The good news is that you've inherited a lemonade factory with your spouse. The bad news is that before you take it over, you need to take a tour of all 36 deadly, spike filled levels. Super Lemonade Factory is a 2D platformer, where the objective is to get you and your spouse to the exit door of each level. Along the way, you'll jump over spikes, ride on platforms, break boxes, push boxes, double jump, talk to employees and dodge them all at the same time. There is no sort of management to this game, even if its your factory. Its just a straight up hardcore 2D platformer.\n\nThere are two characters in the game, the husband and the wife. You can switch between the two of them with the push of a button. The husband can do a single jump, but can dash, which breaks through boxes. The wife can do a double jump, and can talk with employees which makes them halt their pace. Since the husband can't jump high, the wife will need to push boxes down for him to get up. Since the wife cannot dash through big boxes, its up to the husband to get through. Getting hit by employees hurts you. When you get hurt by employees or spikes, you respawn at the last checkpoint. If you get hurt twice, that spouse dies and you restart the level. Did I also mention that the wife can get a piggy back ride? That way you don't have to traverse the level with two different characters. There is a two player mode, but I played it one player. The three button, jump, switch, dash / talk controls feel good and easy enough.\n\nThe game looks great with its pixelated graphics, but I think the real unexpected joy was how good the old school chiptunes are. I am not one to talk about music in a game, but these tunes are almost up there at Megaman 2 quality. There is also a good use of color pallets too. The minimalistic style hits the mark for me.\n\nThe 36 levels are broken into three areas of 12 levels each. Each area has its own theme, and really its like a level of difficulty. The game starts off pretty easy and educates you to everything without slowing you down. Then by the third area, there are a lot of spikes and precision jumps over and between them. The spikes are more of a nuescence than other spike jump platform games. These spikes will hurt / kill your characters even from the side. It is not a common problem, but when it is, it needlessly amps up the difficulty.\n\nSpeaking of the difficulty, as you go through the levels, each one has a bottle cap. Its your choice to pick them up. A few levels have sugar bags to collect. These will give both characters an extra hit, causing a respawn before they're dead and you restart the level. However, there's nothing representing that extra hit, like there are hearts up at the top next to each character.\n\nThe game keeps track if you've talked to everyone in a level. If the game isn't hardcore enough of a challenge for you, there's a hardcore mode of each level that takes the normal levels and adds more spikes. In fact, for those truly looking for even more of a challenge, there is old school mode that lets each spouse get hurt four times. The catch is, if one of them dies, that's it. You need to restart the game and not just the level. Its up to you. Completing the game and getting all of the bottle caps took me around two hours. Everything else just seems excessive to me.\n\nThere seems to be some way to load custom levels, but there doesn't seem to be an editor in the game. Trying to select a level to play managed to crash the game for me on Windows 7. That was the only crash though. There are plenty of people in the forum complaining about bugs and issues. Maybe that's why less than 8% of people have gotten the first achievement. Maybe its just the difficulty preventing them from getting that first achievement. The developer seems willing and able to fix bugs.\n\nThis was a great blend of art, music and gameplay well worth the $5 even if it was around 2 hours for me. The gameplay formula is good enough to carry a game with a wider mainstream appeal with a longer game length. I think the developer can pull it off in the future to be more than just a hardcore platformer.","November 19, 2014","false","3.7"," 39 of 46 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","39","46","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cerealman/recommended/307270/","cerealman","Harveysaur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cerealman/","173 products in account","Super Lemonade Factory is a fun little game about you earning your father's inheritance, a giant super lemonade factory (hence the name).\n\nWhilst it is nothing groundbreaking, it's a fun little piece that you could certainly rack up a good few hours in. As a 2D Side scrolling plat former, it plays pretty basic. You must switch between two characters, and use their abilities to help one another get past a certain obstacle, obese managerial officer or a harmless office plant. The game offers three game modes, Normal, Hardcore, and Old School, each of which are basically a different difficulty, but the Old School mode really puts you in your place and requires quick thinking and a ♥♥♥♥ ton of lemonade.\n\nWith what seems like a playful story, the character dialogue unsurfaces some mature issues about this post WWII world, making each of the 72 levels that much more satisfying to play through.\n\nOverall, I have enjoyed my time so far in the Super Lemonade Factory and I plan to do so for a short while more.\n\n+ Lovely visuals and accompanying soundtrack\n+ Some deep story elements can be found underneath it's bubbly surface\n+ Plenty of levels and achievements to keep you busy\n\n- Not a big fan of switching characters\n- Some puzzles are cramped, often there is not a lot of room to move and items you need can get stuck in corners\n- I TOTALLY GOT THAT JUMP.

Tooltips still say things like "swipe right or left" - so I'm guessing this is a port from a tablet.\n\nControls can't be rebound, and the keyboard controls are pretty non-standard - arrow keys + XCV, instead of the far more common ZXC. Lost track of the number of times I messed up a jump or a dash because my fingers gravitated to the typical ZXC layout. It doesn't sound like much, but imagine trying to play a FPS with ESDF controls if you're used to WASD.\n\nPressing Escape, for any reason, will automatically exit full-screen mode - if you have to retry a level, you need to go all the way back to the options to set full-screen again, unless you're the sort who doesn't mind windowed mode (philistine).\n\nIt's a shame, because the music and art assets are very pleasing to the ears and eyes - if the developers had spent thirty extra minutes to let people customize their controls, this game would probably be quite fun, but life's too short, and there's plenty of other platforming games in the sea. Even with the bad controls and weird non-persistent options, it'd be a passable Flash game, but in this current state it's not at all worth money.","August 20, 2014","false","1.4"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","30","39","0","2"

The controls are floaty, the level design is uninspired, (3 zones: warehouse, factory and offices, look differently but play the same. There could have been, for example, steam pipes or conveyor belts in the 2nd zone, but no, it's spike hell a the way down) The hitboxes are TERRIBLE - standing on the edge of the platform kills you if there spikes coming from the side. Even if they are separated by a wall. You can't remap controls, bizzarey mapped to xcv. In limited lives mode, you can't restart a single stage - misplacing a crate means you have to restart from the very beginning.\n\nIt's an iOS port, and it shows.","October 4, 2015","false","3.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

There are user made levels, but it wouldn't have been that hard for the developer to make some more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fantadidi/recommended/307270/","fantadidi","Fantasy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fantadidi/","3018 products in account","This retro-game is divided into three parts.\n\nThe first one is the normal mode. To me, it's just a tutorial mode, you have to go through 12 levels three times, but it's not difficult at all.\n\nThe second one is the hardcore mode. More difficult than the normal one, this mode contains levels that are pretty challenging. You'll have to die again and again to get through.\n\nThe third and final part is the old school mode. You have to complete all of the levels (normal+hardcore, which makes a total of 72). If you fail, you have to try again from the beginning, there is no check point between levels. You start with three lives, so remember to collect sugar to get extra ones. I've just done it (number 13 to succeed), it's quite hard !\n\nOverall, if you are looking for challenging achievements and for a game that requires only a few hours to be completed, you should buy this one !","August 24, 2014","true","5.0"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","2"

There are over 72 levels across 3 different game types - Normal, Hardcore and Old School, all of which are very fun. My most favourite is Old School because instead of 3 lives per level you only have 3 lives to last you on ALL the levels, it made the game a lot more exciting for me!

Not worth $5, but hey, on sale it's a great buy.\n\nEDIT (10/15/2014): I figured I'd elaborate on this review since it's sort of just a flat statement.\n\nThis game is a port from the mobile versions. It runs seemingly capped at 30 fps. At first I thought it might have been a compatibility issue with my 144hz monitor, similar to the ongoing issue Spelunky HD faces currently (which still has yet to be resolved, btw), but that wasn't the case. The game is just capped. This hinders the platforming, for which this game is advertised.\n\nThat issue aside, having forced myself to play, this game was still enjoyable. It took all of those 1.3 hours to beat, not rushing through anything. I didn't go for 100% because the low framerate cap eventually became too much to handle.\n\nThe artwork is great, but the music is not memorable.\n\nTo conclude: for 1.3 hours of gameplay $5 is not a bargain in the least, but yeah, on sale it's a worthwhile purchase.","July 21, 2014","true","1.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
