Yet that Spellsworn is running on a stunning UE4 engine, then we aswell has a smooth experience. We also have a large amount of spells to manipulate and blast our enemies in pieaces with, and yet that this game is keyboard only, we have options to re-bind our keys for the ultimate setup. Currently this game has two maps, but within those maps we are allowed to play player vs player, or team vs team by choosing our color's in lobbys. Fear not the low map content, since they also planning custimzation of characters, weapons, banners and emotes.\n\nAccording to player hosting, every player has a option to host the game them self from the in-game host option. This includes password protection and LAN hosting. Each map you play counts your in-game activity for every kill or death.\n\nTalking about release, this one smashes all of them with a smooth experience and intense gameplay. If you have a wizard in your stomach, fear not to show everyone that you are one in the games. Besides their plan of 12-18 month development, we have much to see forward too, which not only marks this game highly recommended for everyone.\n\nHere is a demo:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDvqAPgxTJQ","November 2, 2015","true","7.4"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","29","40","4","0"

Being in lava is similiar to standing underneath a turret on LoL or Dota. This is the main source of damage output, being able to knock your enemies into the lava. It isn't an instant kill, but it rapidly drains health, because of this, most of the spells are focused around knockbacks (quantified in game as punches i think). Others allow you to teleport, heal, reflect enemy spells, and so on(loads more spells on the way). The player starts with 100 health and is out of the match at 0, the winner being the last one standing. Most spells do some damage, but it is usually minimal.\nThe idea is to soften everyone up, so when the battleshield shrinks down to a heartpoundingly small size and lava is everywhere you lookandohmygodlookoutforthatmagicmissleowowowowDEAD. It is tons of fun. Its like if the towers on LoL or DOTA were invincible and slowly crept towards eachother on either side. Think of how intense that would be, thats Spellsworn.\n\nObligatory 10/10 would burn again","November 2, 2015","true","2.0"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","23","31","2","1"

All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I pick the good ones.\n═══════════════════════════════════\nOVERVIEW\nNOTE: this is a review of the pre-alpha early access version, every problem with the game at this stage can, and most of them will likely, be addressed and improved.\n\nThis is a MOBA that shares alot of similarities to Magicka: wizard wars, but adds elements from the other typical MOBAs.  you play as a wizard fighting other wizards using a variety of spells.  The spells are bought in the match, through the shop, only for that match.  a single match is composed of 5 rounds, and before each round starts, the players get to access the shop to buy new spells or upgrade already owned ones with the points given to them before rounds.  the spells are catagorized and have varius effects.  to win a round, your team must be the last ones standing.  the most common way of killing a person is to hit them with your spells and push them into the lava, or purple fluid thing, depending on the map you are playing on.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/360620/\n\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\nPros:\neasy to learn, hard to master\nspell variety\nshop rounds between rounds adds an element of adabtability were you have to evolve according to your enemies tactics\ngameplay is fun and intense\ncharecter selection, progression, and skins (all those are currently place holders at this stage, hopefully they will be filled in in later builds)\n\nCons:\ngraphics are what you expect for a ~200 MB game\nanimations feel stiff and slow, even though that helps in the final frantic moments of a round\nmatches long, and players joining in on a running match go into spectator mode for a looooooong time, then get kicked back to the main menu after the match is over\nno practice mode, or even bot games for you to try the different spells at your own pace\nat this stage, the player base is small, and will be hard to get into matchs at times (it is an early access alpha)\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nits a MOBA that revolves around adaptability and forward planning, it is not as competitive as LoL nor has the complixty and learning curve of magicka.  instead, it learns and adapts a bit of the good from both.  fun, easy to learn, rough around the edges.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curtations here!","November 5, 2015","true","1.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

This means that those people can just destroy any new player, which they will due to the low playerbase.  I feel its a good game, but the good players prevent me from becoming better and push me away from playing the game.  The game also feels a little bit laggy, but that is just because it is early access and probably will be improved.  Once this game becomes more known and there is a system to help new players learn the game instead of queueing into already good players, then the game will be worth playing if you are new to these types of games like me.","November 17, 2015","false","1.4"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","12","22","3","0"

Unfortunately this has become something of a black mark against a game due to the tirade of awful asset flips and half-arsed things out there. Despite this I think that Spellsworn may actually do really well out of early access. My main reasoning for this is that the game is already perfectly playable and even fun.\n\nSpellsworn as I said is already a ‘complete’ game, it’s just very basic and a little rough around the edges. The idea if the game is that you (alone or in a team) are put into a PvP arena that is constantly shrinking as damaging lava starts to cover the ground. The objective is simply to survive longer than your opponents. Each match is split into a number of different rounds and between each round you are able to buy and/or upgrade your spells so that you’ll be even deadlier in the next round. Whomever wins the most rounds wins the match!\n\nThe current roster of spells is somewhat diverse yet uninventive. Offering not only attack spells but a number of defensive, transportation and utility spells which means that there are lots of different options and there is no clear build to go for in order to win. For now at least the upgrading system is a dull stat increase and it seems that having more spells, and thus less downtime between casting something, is always a better choice. Beyond this there seems to be at least a few different characters models to unlock but as for current content that’s about it.\n\nThis lack of content is definitely the biggest mark against the game as after only a few matches I had had my fill. But this is, I hope, just the start of this game’s journey. The basic mechanics of the game are very solid and with the addition of a more detailed progression system, more spells and more modes as the game gets closer to release would make for a fantastic arena game and I for one am very much looking forward to what becomes of it.","December 5, 2015","true","1.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Then after realizing my failure I got an extra copy for a friend that was coming over.  Ended up playing each other hrs.  Definetly has a LoL feel to the moving/attacking.  Game play is very responsive and tight.  The spells have a satisfying feel when you cast. One current problem is since its only multiplyer pvp and no local co-op and its pre-alpha there is no player base.  Basically unless you know someone with the game you won't be playing this atm.  That being said I had a blast with just 1 friend and if we get our LoL friend into it I know it would be insanely fun.  Lil more polish with diff modes (a random mode where it picks for you and you all get the same spells would be my first hope) and this could be the go to lan party game.","March 16","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Imagine mashing league and smash together, but only having magic spells, and then pump it with steroids. That's what this game is like. The gameplay is really intense, and it'll keep you hooked for hours on end. There are endless combinations of spells that you could choose, adding in much more gameplay than you'd expect. However, being the early alpha there are some flaws. Currently, there aren't usually a lot of people online. If you play at night, there'll be times where the amount of people online will be SINGLE DIGITS, but usually there are one or two matches that are still open, so you'll be fine.\n\nPros:\n-Fast & Intense gameplay\n-deep gameplay\n\nCons:\n-Not enough people (for now)","March 5","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The biggest problem so far is that there aren't enough players to play with, mostly.\nI think the developer should just handle out more keys for the game, just to make sure that enough ppl are playing it. And then they can offer it for 10Euro.\n\nBut at this stage, I do not recommend to buy it. If you can get a key from developer or somewhere else, then get it and try to play it, but paying 10 Euro for a game where 5 ppl worldwide are online is not worth it so far!\n\nStill I do recommend and rate this game posivitive, because if u find players then it makes a lot of fun and its easy to learn but hard to master!\n\n\nGERMAN\n\nHier ist ein Video zu dem Game und meine Meinung zu Spellsworn findet ihr unter dem Video.\nhttps://youtu.be/Ai-VK86qg34\n\nHab grad den Key vom Entwickler bekommen und ich muss sagen mir gefällt das skillshot pvp arena System. D.h. ihr müsst wie bei "Magicka" oder auch "Bloodline Champions" zielen anstatt point und klick spells zu benutzen.\nIch werde versuchen dieses Review so viel wie möglich zu updaten.\nDas Problem zur Zeit ist die nicht vorhandene Community. Das heißt man findet kaum jemanden zum zocken und da es ein reines PVP Spiel ist das scheiße. DIe Entwickler haben aber zur Zeit regelmäßiger Spielzeiten eingeführt. Also könnt ihr 2 mal in der Woche wenigstens mit jemanden zusammen bzw. gegeneinander spielen.\n\nSpielzeiten:\nTuesdays & Thursdays 17:00-18:00 (5pm-6pm) (UTC+01:00)\n(Dienstag & Donnerstag (18:00-19:00) CET\n\nAber wie schon gesagt zur Zeit empfehle ich es keinem das Spiel für 10 Euro zu kaufen, außer wenn ihr das mit Freunden zusammen kauft. Den außerhalb dieser Spielzeiten findet man kaum jemand Online.\n\nIch gebe dem Spiel trotzdem, bis jetzt, eine Positive Wertung da es sehr viel Spaß macht und viel Skill erfordert.
