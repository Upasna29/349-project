"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arvinda/recommended/9180/","Arvinda","Billenkoek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arvinda/","108 products in account","This pack doesn't include Commander Keen 6 and Keen dreams is missing. Some people have been disappointed because those games weren't included, so be aware! Don't get this pack if you’re  planning on playing Keen 6 and Keen dreams.\n\nThis review is mainly pointed towards Commander Keen 5: The Armageddon Machine, because I played the living ♥♥♥♥ out of it when I was a kid. I remember getting this game from my uncle on a floppy disk, I took the disk home and installed it, with difficulty, back then I didn't knew much about computers. I finally managed to install it and then I started playing, and I was blown away because the game was so ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. I loved messing around in the levels and exploring them, I died a lot because this was the first real game I played on PC, then I discovered this strange option called 'save' and it remembered where I was! English isn't my native language so I had trouble understanding some parts of the game. I still remember the big red guy with the automatic rifle who instantly killed you when you were in his sights, when I first encountered him I literally jumped out of my chair, I had never seen something so frightening.\n\nAnd effectually I was there, the final level, I remember every second of that remarkable level and when I finished the level and I had beaten Commander Keen 5: The Armageddon Machine, I felt great I had conquered this beast of a game. After beating the game I spent hours upon hours replaying the levels and playing pong. Later I found out that if you pressed F1 (or some other button I don't really remember), the game would load a page with the LORE of Commander Keen 5: The Armageddon Machine, the ♥♥♥♥ing Lore of  Commander Keen 5: The Armageddon Machine, holy ♥♥♥♥. And when I found the 'lore' I looked at the pictures of all the enemies I had encountered and I even saw pictures of enemies I didn't encounter, because you could only encounter those on hard mode. (I just looked at the pictures and because at the time I didn't speak a word English.)\n\nYears later I found out Commander Keen was available on steam and I had some money on my steam wallet and I was like: ♥♥♥♥ it I'm buying Commander Keen. And I was able to play my childhood love yet again.\n\nWell enough of MY experiences with the game, lets actually talk about the game. It's a miracle if you actually read my story and made it so far!\n\nCommander keen is simple platformer, it's about a guy, Keen. From my current understanding he is just a dude who travels to random planets and shoots aliens  with his little laser gun, he also has a pogo stick which makes him jump higher. This pack included Keen 1,2,3,4 and 5. The first ones look really old, but the fourth and the fifth looked a lot cleaner and a lot newer.  All of the games play pretty similarly and have the game character and weapons. But I didn’t really finish any other Keen game except Keen 5, so I might be wrong because some things are different later in game. But in Commander Keen 5 you have to collect four diamonds to open doors to continue within the level, then you have to find a key that opens the door to the end of the level, later you have to destroy something what looks like the power source for the space ship you are stranded on. In the game you will encounter various enemies, some are robots some are 'energy enemies', the robots can be killed the 'energy enemies' can only be stunned or can't get hit at all. You have one life, so if you get hit once you are done for, yet you can save everywhere you want, so that isn't a big problem or a hard part about this game. All in all it’s just an old school platformer, that is as unforgiving as any other old game and needless to say the game is also very fun!\n\nAfter playing this game again after so many years, it made me realize that Commander Keen 4 is way superior to Commander Keen 5, because the fourth installment had way more variety. And when I look back at the levels of Commander Keen 5 I realized that they game wasn't really that special. It was just the fact that it was the first game I ever played and finished, what made it so great. The nostalgia made me love this game.\n\nNostalgia is a ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my game review of Commander Keen, one of my favorite games if not my favorite game of all time!","June 19, 2015","true","4.5"," 70 of 74 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","70","74","6","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tunaftw/recommended/9180/","tunaftw","Big Tuna","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tunaftw/","221 products in account","This "Complete Pack" contains the first five full Keen titles, excluding Keen Dreams and Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter! probably due to publishing rights issues.\n\nCommander Keen in Marooned on Mars:\nThe first entry into the series, and a very enjoyable one. The difficulty isn't too high or too low, just about right; it's short and sweet. Even though there is a tad bit of input lag regarding controls, it never really makes you perform pixel-perfect jumps or anything that difficult. And despite the lack of music and somewhat annoying sound FX, the title still retains a lot of its original charm.\n\nCommander Keen in The Earth Explodes:\nOut of the original trilogy, this is my least favorite one. Why? Because it's basically the first one, but quickly loses its charm when the unfair gameplay kicks in. And I don't mean "unfair" as in "challenging", I mean unnecessarily aggravating. This is due to the tad bit of input lag, bull**** level design, and annoying enemy AI. Thanks for that John Carmack.\n\nCommander Keen in Keen Must Die!:\nThis entry is even more unforgiving than the second, and the lack of music and sound FX REALLY wears on you by now. Why isn't it my least favorite? The main antagonist. Without spoiling anything, the main antagonist and his simple (yet relatable) backstory make the game worth seeing through to the end, and you barely even learn anything about him until the boss fight, which luckily, isn't too hard. I'll just say... it shows a lot of humility for id Software, considering how they went on to turn the entire industry upside down multiple times.\n\nCommander Keen in Secret of the Oracle:\nThis is probably my favorite Keen title, why? Well, one reason is Dopefish's glorious debut. Another is how nearly every aspect of Keen was improved vastly. This is when the Keen series felt much more like a fully-formed franchise rather than a labor of love from a group of eager programmers. The graphics are much more colorful and cartoony, the gameplay is MUCH more fluid and MUCH less aggravating, and there is actual background music that’s catchy and makes the experience more enjoyable. And you can't forget Dopefish, we will never forget Dopefish.\n\nCommander Keen in The Armageddon Machine:\nA lot like Secret of the Oracle, except new levels, music, easter eggs, and sadly leaves on a big cliffhanger, and I only mention this because the sixth title is not included leaving you to find it yourself. Still a lot of fun and pretty enjoyable. The only nitpick I really have is how you actually beat the game, as it is very confusing and very hard to actually figure out how to blow the last fuse. Otherwise, a solid Keen title.\n\nSome people complain on how "You're paying for an emulator!" or "It's missing two episodes!” I really don't. This is the bulk of a classic series, and you're paying how much? Five dollars? And you'll probably wait for a sale anyway, won't you. You should be grateful it's even on Steam for legitimate purchase. Also, the games run almost flawlessly in DOSBox for me at least, unlike many other DOS games released on Steam packaged with DOSBox...\n\nIf you want to explore id's past, want to dive into another retro platformer, or simply just bored, buy the pack now for five bucks. Don't even wait for a sale, it's not really worth waiting for when you could be playing now.\n\nEDIT: If you would like to see a full release of Keen Dreams on Steam (w/ Achievements, Leaderboards, and other Steam features) running natively on Windows and Linux PC's, click here to check out this new source port:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/356200/\nI even made the trailer on the Steam page you see there.\nMaybe this could prompt id Software to do a similar overhaul with this release.","April 26, 2014","true","6.2"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","38","40","0","0"

You jump, run and shoot your way through 2D levels, avoiding traps, gaps and monsters.\n\nBeing an oldschool game, the difficulty is sometimes a little bit silly.\n\nWhile 4, 5 and 6 had mid save options, in 1 - 3 you could only save in the main area, not inside levels. Combined with nearly unkillable powerjumping...we called them Zombie kangaroos...this game is quite a number of difficulty.\n\nAfter the 4th part you also got a difficulty option, that enables traps and increase the amount of monsters.\n\nBeside that, the game has a little ongoing story about the main character, explaining him and why he is doing all that (genius child, build a blaster and a rocket ship with parts of his familys home).\n\n(PS: Every game has at least one hidden area and level)\n\n\nThe bad part about the bundle (yes its 5 games in one), that it is missing the last 2 games. 6 was a special limited edition (who limits a game???) and 7...we dont talk about 7.\n\n\nThe story doesnt end with 6 or 7 ether, so fans made Keen 7 (denying the existence of the real keen 7), Keen 8 and Keen 9, who look quite decent and end the Keen story for good.

There is just not enough reason to justify this purchase when it is the bare minimum of what could have been done to make this a working game. The Commander Keen series is an amazing set of games, a piece of the history of PC gaming, and Steam treated this piece of history like most people treat their garbage.\n\nTo elaborate,  Commander Keen was the first PC game to have Parallax scrolling, the same kind of scrolling that Super Mario uses to be able to have a Platformer. At the time, it was a huge deal to have the entire level not be a single screen. So Commander Keen was produced to prove that a PC could support a full Platformer of many screens and levels. The game has an overworld and lets you play levels in any order, you get to shoot enemies from a distant and it is also the Nintendo Hard you would expect from a classic game, so it should be a dream for people who wish to visit a time when 2D was king. To neglect this classic trilogy and the 2/3rds of a trilogy sequel would be a shame.\n\nNow, I am not suggesting you buy this pack. Especially if you don't know the series already. This pack is a bare minimum attempt at a quick buck off of some old shareware games.  Yes, you heard me, SHAREWARE. If you are not aware, due to age or not being a PC gamer until after Floppy Disks disappeared, Shareware was the precursor to Playable Demo games on services such as Playstation Network, X-Box Live Arcade and yes, even Steam, where you would get a part of the game on a floppy disk at no charge, to try out. In the main menu, you would often see an "Order Now!" or "Ordering Details" option that let you buy the full game's disk for a reasonable sum of money. It spread the word of companies and got them some revenue as well as positive customer feedback that people were willing to pay money for their ideas.\n\nSo, since the game (well Commander Keen 1 and Commander Keen 4 are Shareware, at least) is technically free, you would think that this pack would do something more to make you want to buy it, right? Well, you'd be wrong. In fact, this pack is actually more of a hassle than going out and downloading Commander Keen 1, 2, 3 and 4 and a DOSBox Emulator yourself. To access any game past Commander Keen 1, you have to open up your Steam window, go into your library and launch it from there. Double Clicking the Shortcut that is generated on the desktop does nothing more than launch the first game. Not even a hastily slapped together Commander Keen selection menu screen comes up, just the default steam menu with radial buttions even after going through the hassle.\n\nSo I suggest to you to save your money, go get a DOSBox Emulator, and download Commander Keen 1 to try out. You don't have to send any money and it is legal because that's how the game was released back in the day. And if you go and get the non-shareware games? Well, it's not like ID software is going to come after you for picking up a title that they don't even have the rights to anymore. Though, the one thing this pack does RIGHT is that Commander Keen 5: The Armageddon Machine has it's copy protection (having one of the items you need to complete the level not spawn at all, making the second level impossible to complete) set to working properly as if you bought the game.","December 6, 2014","false","8.6"," 45 of 77 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","45","77","5","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/9180/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nCommander Keen Complete Pack is a DOS platformer from the 1990's by Apogee Software (now known as 3D Realms). While the game is very much focused on being an arcade platformer game, the designers included a story explaining what was going on within the game... Interested? Read on.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  Billy Blaze is your standard 8 year old boy, by standard we mean he making his own unraveling adventure in space, starting off with fighting the Vorticons and saving planet earth, then receiving news of a new threat to the Galaxy Keen rushes off to consult the Keepers of the Oracle.\nIt is worth noting for die-hard-Commander-Keen Fans, that not all games are present: 1 Marooned on Mars. 2 The Earth Explodes. 3 Keen Must Die! 4 Secrets of the Oracle. 5 The Armageddon Machine. are available in the Commander Keen Complete Pack.\n\nGame Play: It has already been established that the Commander Keen Complete Pack is a platformer, but in addition to standard movement controls you have a laser gun, and a Pogo Stick (being the signature item of the franchise). You can jump, and the Pogo stick gives you even higher jumps. When I was little, no one in my family knew what this game was called. So we called lovingly called it "Pogo"!\nIn Addition to the movement features of the game, there are various "accessory" items that help you unlock different levels, or unlock doors within a level. While in many of the games there are levels and extra's you can skip over, trying to track down all the secrets in these games really increases it's replay-ability. (Hey, keep in mind this is a DOS game developed in the 1990's, the fact that this type of game is still fun to play is pretty impressive)\n\nAchievements: There are no achievements in the Commander Keen games, however there are High Scores. As with very old classic Arcade games; you would try to get the highest score and then put in perverted messages to the poor souls who never had the mad skills you did.\n\nPrice The Commander Keen Complete Pack is priced at $4.99, if you sit down and actually play the game you can easily get more then 4 hours worth of game play, the games have a really nice combination of difficulty, exploration, platforming and secret area's.\n\n*Graphics Graphics is a NEW category that I'm adding exclusively for this particular review. I don't personally care about graphics in video games, I feel that bad mechanics (or Game Play) speak stronger then if you're seeing every poly in the character. But I want to emphasis that this is an old game, so if you do intend to get it without having any internal motivation, keep in mind this is a game LOOKS, SOUNDS, and often times FEELS old.\n\n*Nostalgia Nostalgia is a NEW category that I'm adding exclusively for this particular review. I think it's pretty safe to say that 90% of the people who have played and/or reviewed this game are all motivated by the same thing: This is a game of our past. For me personally this was the first PC Game *I ever played*. Nearly the first game in general, but Super Mario Land for the Gameboy takes first place.\nIf you want to take a step back and know what type of game I was playing when I was a little kid, go ahead and buy this game, then let me know what you thought about it!\n\nConclusion: Do I recommend... or not recommend... that is the question. Most people will pass up this game, and that's fine. It probably only appeals to gamers who enjoy Platformers, or those of us who played this game when we were little.\nI am going to recommend this game to people who enjoy platformers, specifically Commander Keen 4 "Secrets of the Oracle", the earlier games are more of a novelty, while still often times difficult, I personally preferred Commander Keen 4 and 5, to the original Trilogy.\n","March 13, 2015","true","7.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Here is the simple solution I came up with to run the game, that has worked for a number of people. Sadly, you will need to do this for each keen game. But they follow the same path. Enjoy!\n\nSolution to get the game running:\nLook for the [keen(#).conf] file in C:Program Files>Steam>SteamApps>common>Commander Keen>base(#)>\n\nOpen it up with notepad or notepad+ and change the output=overlay (This works on most computers, but there is an occasional card/driver combo that won't. If it doesn't then try opengl or openglnb.) Now just hit file>save and you're done. The game should run now.\n\nSolution to getting the game running at the optimium screen resolution:\nIf your game is having issues with the screen being stretched or really small, you want want to edit some other values in the keen.conf file. This would be changing fullscreen=true, fulldouble=true, and fullresolution=[your screen's resolution]\nEg. fullresolution=1366x768 (When I first got the game it was running super wide and some of the game was cut off)\n\nI have tried to make this as clear as possible, but if you still have questions, feel free to ask!\n\nReview:\nI have loved this game from the time I was a little lad. It is a really fun platformer with a pretty silly story! The pack includes the first five games of the series, but not the 6th or keen dreams. The 4th game "Secret of the Oracle" is my absolute favorite. Great story, mechanics, and art. I mean, come on! With a blaster and pogo stick, what more could a kid want (No aliens were harmed in the making of this game...ok maybe a few). The game shows a little age (especially the first few). Definitely a must have if you played the games before, but even if you haven't I think the game is worth it, although I'm a little bias.\n\n"The dopefish lives"\n\nCheck out my other adventure reviews on my page!","February 9","true","1.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Well, this game actually "could" have been exclusivity of Nintendo, yes, you read it right, but, the producers "John Carmack" and "John Romero" tried to sell the idea to the big company and they were refused, told that the PCs didn't had a future (i imagine that it wouldn't have a future only inside Nintendo hehehe), and since they wanted to prove them wrong, they created this game, Commander Keen, that has became an Hype on PC, being something like a "Rival" of the same level of quality of Mario... In the PC...\n\nWell, forgive my history lessons, this game is very good! But it is old, veeeeeery old! So, he is more a way to travel though time for those who don't know how old games are like, and also it servers has away to remember the old times, for the more "experienced" gamers.\n\nThis game surely worth it's price! And has any classic game, it is a MUST for anyone that would like to have a collection of games, and with such a beautifull background, why would you refuse?\n\nPs: It is good to remind that "John Carmack" and "John Romero" were the heart of ID Software, and Doom, the father of shooters...\nPs²: In my humble opinion "John Romero" is one of the biggest master of videogames, related to my favorite game, Deus Ex (1).\n\nPortuguese:\nOk... ummmm, como eu vou explicar isso para os novatos?\n\nVamos lá... Bom este jogo na verdade "poderia" ter sido exclusividade da Nintendo, sim, você leu certo, porém, os produtores "John Carmack" e "John Romero" tentaram vender a idéia para a grande empresa e lhes foram recusadas, dizendo que PCs não teriam futuro (eu imagino que não teria futuro apenas dentro da Nintendo hehehe), e como eles queriam prova o contrário, criaram este jogo, Commander Keen, que se tornou um Hype no PC, sendo algo como um "Rival" de igual para igual de Mario... No Pc...\n\nOk, agora chega de lição de história, o jogo é muito bom! Mas, é velho, beeeeeem velho, então ele serve como uma viagem no tempo para quem não conhece jogos antigos, e serve como meio de reviver os velhos tempos para os "Experientes".\n\nVale sim a pena este jogo, e como todo clássico, é um MUST para quem faz coleções de games, e como uma história tão bonita, porque você se recusaria?\n\nObs: Vale lembrar que "John Carmack" e "John Romero" foram o coração da ID Software, e Doom, o pai dos shooters...\nObs²: Na minha humilde opinião"John Romero" é um dos maiores mestres de jogos, relacionado ao meu game predileto, Deus Ex (1).","December 6, 2013","true","1.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It is actually a rather challenging game for a few reasons. Most of the levels are large and you have the real possibility when falling down into the unknown of landing on an enemy or lava or spikes, as you may expect. Everything that kills you does it in one hit, there are no life points, it's just that these aliens have some crazy microbiotic make up that you cannot survive at all. So often does a game with this makeup become uninteresting and too difficult. But the crazy-happy appearance of the game kind of keeps you drawn to it. Secondly, the puzzles are difficult but not at all beyond reason.\n\nOverall a much cooler platform experience than most of the new attempts at this genre. Though actually the genre itself is pretty much a closed chapter in gaming to some degree. Very well done game for it's time, and still very awesome in its fully functional and entertaining and zany way.","August 4, 2014","true","0.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's still fresh and fly.\n\nThere are some caveats - this isn't really a port as much as the original games wrapped in dosbox with perhaps some minor compatibility tweaks. Things I would have hoped for - the ability to have it be sharp pixels at max resolution/fullscreen instead of blurred, support for controller being saved instead of having to be set on each load and hey would be awesome to have achievements or something thrown in there. But let's be real, it's great that it works super easily with the xbox controller at all.

The platforming is silky smooth, the areas varied and colorful, and the pogo stick allows for some creative approaches to completing levels.  Secret of the Oracle and the Armaggedon Machine are just flat out fun, and are worth the $5.00 alone that this pack costs.\n\n-Episodes 1-3 have aged a bit less gracefully, but personally I love these games.  Episode 1 was the first game I ever played, and really got me into the world of id software (and pc games in general).  Keep in mind too that the engine powering these games was revolutionary at the time, with these being the first legitimate sidescrollers available on the pc (John Carmack kicking ♥♥♥ with engine design before the Wolfensteins, Dooms, and Quakes came along).  Think of these as a nice bonus to the still excellent gameplay found in episodes 4 and 5.\n\nAnyway, this pack is certainly worth its $5.00 price tag.  Romero's creativity and excellent design sense, combined with Carmack's engine work made for some great games back then, and its nice to see how well these hold up to this day.","May 20, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One day, one of them sent me this, saying that I should play it since it was such an important part of gaming history. I did and... Eh.\n\nAlthough it's confusing at first, the controls are rather simple and very smooth. It's just... Not what you'd expect nowadays. For earlier DOS standards, the graphics are pretty good. May as well get if if you never played it.\n\nWatch out now, here comes a load of text for each of the games in the collection, this is gonna be a doozey!\n\n\nEpisode 1: Marooned On Mars\nBilly Blaze, eight year-old genius, working diligently in his backyard clubhouse has created an interstellar starship from old soup cans, rubber cement and plastic tubing. While his folks are out on the town and the babysitter has fallen asleep, Billy travels into his backyard workshop, dons his brother's football helmet, and transforms into...\n\nCommander Keen - Defender of Earth!\n\nIn this episode, aliens from the planet Vorticon VI find out about the eight year-old genius and plan his destruction. While Keen is out exploring the mountains of Mars, the Vorticons steal vital parts of his ship and take them to distant Martian cities! Can Keen recover all the pieces of his ship and repel the Vorticon invasion? Will he make it back before his parents get home? Stay tuned!\n\nKeen's mission in this game is to find back the stolen parts of his ship. The evil Vorticons have stolen four objects from the ship and hidden them all in different places on Mars. Commander Keen's Megarocket was constructed from objects found around his house, which have been modified into starship parts. As a manual flight controller, he has used a joystick from his brother's video game. As for electricity, he has used a car battery from his mom's car. A heavily modified vacuum cleaner from their kitchen has been used as a ion propulsion unit. And as for fuel, he has used everclear from his dad's liquor cabinet.\n\n\nEpisode 2: The Earth Explodes\nIn this episode a Vorticon Mothership is poised above Earth, preparing to destroy every major city within their deadly Tentalus Ray! Keen must sneak aboard the ship and stop each Tantalus team from their terrible task. If he fails, the Earth explodes!\n\nAs you already know, your mission is to stop these evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s from blowing up the earth. In order to do this you need to find and destroy each X-14 Tantalus Ray, powered by cells from the big purple Space Amoeba. You need to find your way in the ship to each Tantaulus Control Room. You start in the ship's galley, and and must find items to help you on your quest. You already have a Vorticon Hyper-Pistol, which has almost no ammunition at all, and of course, the pogo stick from your mars adventure.\n\nEpisode 3: Keen Must Die\nIn the last episode commander keen disabled the Vorticon Mothership, and now in this final episode in the trilogy commander keen is making his way to the planet Vorticon VI. Then he lands on the island of Vortville, from where he tries to travel to the city of New Vorticon, which is very well guarded by a huge vorticon army. Then he must pass the impossible maze of the Caves of Oblivion. When he passes it, he will finally reach the Castle of the Grand Intellect. Just who is The Grand Intellect and can you stop him before he destroys earth?\n\nNow your mission is to make your way to the Castle of the Grand Intellect on the planet Vortiocon VI, and discover the secret of the Grand Intellect. The Vorticon Elder on the Vorticon's Mothership told you two things. Firstly, the Vorticons are not evil - the Grand Intellect is controlling them with his "Mind-Belts". And secondly, the Grand Intellect is from Earth! Who could he be?\n\nEpisode 4: Secret Of The Oracle\nBilly has been working on a new invention in this episode. His latest invention is the Photachyon Tranceiver, a radio that can reviece signals from anywhere in the galaxy. After playing around with his new invention, he suddenly hears a strange message: "brrzzz ... giggg ... oment of great triumph ... frzzt ... ast the Milky Way will be ... huzzzzz ... terly destroyed ... pyuneeeeeeg ... can stop us now. We will remake the galaxy in the name of the Gannalech. Power to our race! power to the Shikadi!" After zapping his parents, Billy heads to The Oracle of Gnosticus IV, who will help Billy with his mission.\n\nBut after arriving on Gnosticus IV he discovers that the Shikadi have already been there. The Shikadi seems to have kidnapped all the members of the council, and taken them all to the shadow lands in the west side of the planet. Sounds like a interesting mission for commander keen.\n\nEpisode 5: The Armageddon Machine\nThe story in this episode continues from the "Secret of the Oracle" episode. In last episode, Keen rescued all the members of the council. And now in episode 5, Keen finds out about the Shikadi's enourmous ship, which has the largest weapon ever built. Now it seems like the Shikadi have built a huge machine to destroy the world. And now Commander Keen flies to the Shikadi's ship in order to save the world.\n\nYour mission in this episode is to find the various power stations and break them with your pogo stick, and then to destroy the main power cell and make the armageddon machine harmless.\n\nSurprisingly, episode 6: Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter isn't in this collection. I dunno why but they must have their reasons.\n\n(I told ya that was gonna be a doozey, didn't I?)","July 17, 2014","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This merges all 6 games together. As a sidescroller, it's really meant for a joystick but it's simple enough that a  keyboard will get you through. You walk around an overhead map ala Super Mario 3 and choose which levels you do in what order, looking for color coded key cards and pieces to fix your broken spaceship.

While I could give credit to ID for creating one of the first PC side-scrollers, I will say that this has not aged well at all, and not only do you get killed in one hit by everything, but there is also absoultely no way you can give yourself a health powerup that can give a little leeway towards being damaged by enemies.  The backgrounds in episodes 1-3 are incredibly dull, and it feels like I'm playing a launch Atari 5200 game. To make matters even worse, you have a lives counter, and in a game like this, you will get so many game overs that you will want to destroy your computer, and play the Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 on the NES instead. If you want an old PC sidecroller really bad that doesn't tear you into pieces and is vomit-inducing, I would go with just the original Duke Nukem, and avoid the second one, as that one is unforgiving compared to the first. If I were you, I'd buy Sonic the Hedgehog, or any other Sega Genesis classic here instead, you won't regret it.","October 26, 2014","false","2.3"," 4 of 31 people (13%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","13","4","31","2","0"

When they were first released, and you were fortunate enough to be a PC owner, they were a great alternative to owning a console. Back then, this WAS the superior platformer. It made Mario look like garbage, and anything on the Atari couldn't even touch something like this.\n\nHowever these games have aged terribly. The controls are clunky and unresponsive, items do not have an initial easily figured out use, and the maze like platforming gameplay can become frustrating quickly if you don't have the patience for it.\n\nThese games were made in the era of sharing information with friends, and figuring out all the secrets and gathering the right items in the labyrinth like areas so you could progress and actually figure out what's going on. Now you can easily look up a faq, or wiki and stomp through the game, and already know everything in advance.\n\nIf you want to play these things blind  and have the patience of a saint to put up with clunky controls, and some often times horrible level design go for it. Otherwise stay away and save yourself the frustration of watching Commander Keen die a few hundred times.\n\nThis game just didn't age well, and it shows in the gamplay, graphics, and controls. If you played it before, and the nostalgia of maybe trying it again is getting to you, don't let it, it's not worth your time to even get involved in it. Keep your good memories of the game and leave it at that, otherwise prepare for massive disappointment. If you've never played a Commander Keen game before, or never heard of him, do yourself the favor and forget you've ever heard or read the name. It'll save some space in that brain of yours, and help you commit to memorizing your current girlfriends birthday who you're just going to dump in a few months anyways.\n\nStay away from this game, let it fall into the depths of gaming history on some terrible wiki page where it belongs, and hopefully be forgotten.","March 6, 2014","false","0.2"," 7 of 42 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","7","42","0","1"

What is so very sad about this fact is that this is the best 2d platformer I've encountered in my quest to play every game in my library.  Yes, I put it above Braid.  How is this possible?  Well, let's look at what's required for a good 2d platformer:\n\nPrecise controls\nInteresting levels\nPrecise controls\nA good difficulty curve\nPrecise controls\n\nThat's not to say Commander Keen is perfect.  The controls are a little tight for my taste, and the scrolling is a little jerky.  The important thing, however, is that the controls are very precise.  Command Keen does exactly what I want him to do, when I want him to do it.  23 years later many platformers have still not mastered this basic concept.\n\nAs for the rest, this is a cool little game.  The levels are interesting, and there's an element of exploration built in as you explore the various towers and levels in any order you want.

What is so very sad about this fact is that this is the best 2d platformer I've encountered in my quest to play every game in my library.  Yes, I put it above Braid.  How is this possible?  Well, let's look at what's required for a good 2d platformer:\n\nPrecise controls\nInteresting levels\nPrecise controls\nA good difficulty curve\nPrecise controls\n\nThat's not to say Commander Keen is perfect.  The controls are a little tight for my taste, and the scrolling is a little jerky.  The important thing, however, is that the controls are very precise.  Command Keen does exactly what I want him to do, when I want him to do it.  23 years later many platformers have still not mastered this basic concept.\n\nAs for the rest, this is a cool little game.  The levels are interesting, and there's an element of exploration built in as you explore the various towers and levels in any order you want.  The levels are short enough as well that you never get the level exhaustion you get in some platformers.\n\nMy only real gripe is the sound effects.

Commander Keen was probably the second platformer I ever played, only being pre-dated by Jump Man.\nAt the time I only owned the first of these games (all 5 or so are included on this), but I must have played it all the way through at least a dozen times. You're a young boy, who's space ship crash landed on an alien planet, and you go around looking for spaceship parts, collecting pizza slices, and shooting aliens. Simple, but incredibly enjoyable.\nOddly enough this kid friendly, no blood or guts, game was created by Id software. Better known as the guys who made DOOM, one of the, if not the, earliest violent FPS games in existance.\n","September 23, 2011","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I was little my grandma had a very old computer with the new Windows 3.1 and DOS. She loaded it with a bunch of trial games for us to play when it was cold, rainy or night time.  My favorite was Commaner Keen, an excellent platform game and puzzle game with a nice story. I thought the game was very difficult when I was younger but it turns out I just sucked as I beat most of the games now. For its time the art, gameplay and puzzles were very good, and the game still stands the test of time today. If you want to play a heartwarming game that will fill you with nostalgia you didn't even know you had, try this one.","November 18, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From there I remember playing the sequels 2 and 3, and finally Commander Keen 4: the first in the series with SOUNDBLASTER SUPPORT!! That's right, no more PC speaker, but actual music and sound effects from a sound card!!  I still remember the day when my dad surprised me by telling me to try out the sound options in the menu, and I was greeted with music coming from my speakers... difference of night and day.  Apparently doesn't have Keen Dreams or Keen 6, but still a great pack to have.","June 25, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Jumping in first 3 episodes is fairly weird before you get used to it, but in 4-6 it feels really solid and fun. The game is very hard (at least to me it is) so I recommend saving before some of the annoying sections in the game and especially the boss battles.\nI recommend Commander Genius source port if you want to have easy time playing this game on modern Windows and what'd you expect in today's time. It has full controller support so I played the whole game on my DualShock 3 with no issues and it made the game far easier than the keyboard controls of the original release.\n\nShameless plug:\nCheck out my guide if you want to set up Commander Genius easily with Steam.","July 16, 2015","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Commander Keen has always been one of my favorite series. It helped me delve into computer games as I grew to love Keen, and Yorp, and all of the characters of the franchise. The sprites and animation are stellar, especially considering the fact of when this game series was made. There are so many hidden gems in the immersive levels, that you can't help but smile as you're playing. Commander Keen is a perfect game series for any person of any age. It spans all "divides" many of us gamers come across. It doesn't matter if you're huge into platform games or not. If you love quirky and charming humor, this series will definitely appeal to you.
