Its a first person wasd + mouse control scheme with only 4 additional forms of input.  Fire, jump, restart, and exit.  These functions change slightly from level to level.  Sometimes you might not be able to jump, sometimes you might be able to fly, sometimes your fire button does... something entirely different.\n\nThere is very little in the sense of hints (usually you have the name of a level and a single short sentence with which to build your guesses).  This can be a boon or a curse depending on how quickly you pick up the goal of a stage.\n\nThe game is somewhat simplistic visually, but handles its setting and theme very well.  With its otherwordly sound track, constant visual tricks, and a very novel approach to death (there technically isn't any), I felt very much like some sort of nethermancer seeking to accumulate souls for whatever purpose a nethermancer soul searches.\n\nI very much suggest purchasing this game, I've already bought several copies for friends.  It's a game you don't want to miss.","November 30, 2014","true","12.6"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","33","35","0","0"

There isn't a tutorial. The faint text "clues" you see are vague and often irrelevant. You're dropped into a starter level to get a hands-on grasp of the controls, and then you get access to a hub with a set of stages, which can be accessed in any order, and you don't have to beat all of them to unlock the next hub. Different levels may share similar themes or structure, but each is technically an isolated instance that must be deciphered. You don't know whether you're just getting from A to B, activating switches, etc. until you try it and find out.\n\nIt's a weird game, but if you are interested in exploration and puzzle-solving with a heavy emphasis on trial and error, this is worth a try.\n\nThe controls are very straightforward: move, jump, and click (which usually functions as "shoot") the platforming is important, but it's in service of solving the puzzles.\n\nThere is a very ominous aesthetic at work. The sights and sounds seem designed to keep you on edge. Some of the levels are calm and quite beautiful, but others have harsh designs that make you wonder if there are unseen dangers that may be revealed as you progress.\n\nAs of this writing, I'm working on the second hub, but I made the mistake of starting the game while I had a headache, and I had to stop earlier than I would've liked. I'll revisit this one soon.","November 27, 2014","true","4.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

It has a really cool abstract art style and level design. It's not your average first-person puzzle platformer.\n\nSo far, I've beaten the first set of levels at least enough to move on to the next set of levels and I have to say the levels are excellently crafted and each one is unique with challenging puzzles that the player must overcome. It also feels really satisfying when you beat a level you've been stuck on or if you finally understand what you have to do to complete a puzzle.\n\nThe people who are raging at this game don't actually grasp the real meaning of this game. It is a puzzle game and requires thinking and time to play. That is what a puzzle game is.\n\nSure the game has a few flaws and some of the levels are a little bit vague but I think that's what the creator wanted. The levels are supposed to be very difficult and abstract.\n\nOverall this game deserves more respect considering it is a truly unique indie puzzle game that gives you an amazing experience. 4.5/5 stars!","December 21, 2014","true","1.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

WTH IS GOING ON??? WHAT SHOULD I DO??? At least there is a "tutorial" (actually it is a wall of text xD) that tells you how you can move (WASD), fire (left click of the mouse), restart (left click) and jump (spacebar).\n\nThe only hints you will have to complete a lvl is the name of it and a short sentence that is creating while your playing. The nice thing is that you can't really die in this game, you will just need to start the lvl again.\n\nThe graphic is simple, beautiful it is own way, but also somehow scary. It also intensify the awe of our unawareness. The sound is filling the game perfectly.\n\nThe bad thing about Ilamentia is that going from fullscreen to windowed mode doesn't function properly and also it is locked at 50fps.\n\nBesides from that minor bugs this game is a real masterpiece in its genre.

This is a really tough puzzle game. I'd even call it puzzle-horror due to how unsettling the surreal landscape is.\nThis is a game for people who like beating a level after smashing their heads against it fifteen times in a row. Puzzles start by giving you a vague hint, and then sending you on your way. You only have three tools, your space bar to jump (usually), your LMB to Emit and capture souls (usually) and your RMB which resets the level. Each level has different rules, and you need to understand them before you can win. The levels are purposefully made to be quite short, though some puzzles require some finesse and can feel longer as a result.\n\nI am not kidding when I say this game's tough. If you start up the game and go "wow I barely beat that level on World 1!" don't feel discouraged. Even the first few worlds are quite challening and you should be proud of yourself that you were up for the task.\n\nAtmosphere-wise, this is a game for people who wished The Witness was a bit more like OFF. The game uses a lot of filters and effects, which can turn off some people, but they eventually grew on me.\n\nI will say right away that this game is not for everyone. The visual effects can be a bit much at times, so play the demo to make sure they don't make you sick. Some of them get really, really trippy.\n\nOverall, I don't regret buying Ilamentia. I have not finished it, but I got about 60-70% of the puzzles. I still play it from time to time to try and crack a few more puzzles. It's always easy to pick up, but very hard to master.","May 20","true","12.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Picture this: You see a giant tower-like object, and you can shoot cubes around it to change their color. The ground under you is completely reflective, as you pace around for a little bit, you notice the reflection of the cubes represents what their color should be in the overhead world. It's simple, not too complicated, but makes for some interesting concepts at times when the puzzles get a bit more difficult. The jumping puzzle was awful, don't even get me started on that, but i'll let it slide considering it's kind of a 3d platformer in a way as well.\n\nIf you like weird games, and 3d platformers, you just might get a decent kick out of it, hell I liked it enough to play for about 5 hours, so hey, give it a try if it looks like something that interests you.","April 27","true","5.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

A set of levels appears to have a common art theme, but not a common gameplay theme.\n\nMany puzzle games introduce a mechanic and build upon it, this game does not do that in a conventional manner.   I'm sure the devs put a lot of time into the game since there are new mechanics in almost every level, but the game doesn't really have a coherent presentation.  Most levels I wouldn't call what I did "solving a puzzle", more just wandering around or trying things randomly until the game progressed.  Was there a mechanic involved to progress? Yes. Was there any depth to that mechanic? Not usually.\n\nThat said, I only played through the first two worlds.  Chances are that the mechanics do build up, as no set of devs can come up with a hundred different mechanics.  But the organization of levels is rather frustrating.  It's like taking a person and tossing them into a workshop and telling them to use one tool, then some other tool entirely. You don't ever develop your skill with one tool because you simply don't get the opportunity to become familiar with it.\n\nThe art is pretty cool.  I don't really care for the soul faces and the 'death' style screen/enemies and actually think they don't fit the game so much (Could just be abstract objects instead), but the rest of the environments are cool looking and provide good ambiance.\n\nOverall it's the kind of game that doesn't make me feel compelled to continue playing due to the disjointness of the puzzles.  It's like finishing the sudoku in the newspaper and then deciding that maybe later you'll come back to doing the crossword and maybe later after that you'll do the word search, or read the comics.  But, more than likely, next week's paper will come out and it'll be forgotten.\n\n\n\n\n\n","August 8, 2015","false","1.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","7","13","3","3"

I definitely don't love it, though. But that's fine, because it hates me too.\n\nWhat is Ilamentia? A first-person game where you:\n1. Solve puzzles\n2. Shoot stuff\n3. Platform\n\nBut I wouldn't call it a first-person puzzle platformer FPS because that isn't really accurate. Sometimes you do all at once. Sometimes you do only one or two.\n\nThe point of the game, really, is that each level plays by its own rules. Practically every level is something unique. The game never really gets repetitive because diversity is its strength.\n\nDiversity is also its weakness, however, since there's plenty of bad ideas mixed in with the good ones. Some levels have way-too-tight platforming for the game engine, some levels have gimmicks mostly focused on obscuring vision, some levels have puzzles too obscure to figure out from the brief hint given at the start of the level. There's also a lot of good platforming and some really clever puzzles. But you can't have the good stuff without the bad stuff too, so the game can go from enjoyable to frustrating at a moment's notice. The graphic style, overall, isn't very friendly either, and the effects in the last world especially are just waaaay too much.\n\nI would say I'm glad I played it, but it's not something I'm rushing off to show others, and there's a lot of bad things to be said about the game too. Consider this on the low end of posititve, I'd put it in the "meh" category if it existed though.","February 28, 2015","true","16.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I'd never heard or seen anything about this game anywhere before. From the trailer Ilamentia looks a bit naff to be honest, a game from the 90s, but I took a gamble on it as it was on sale and I needed to scratch the itch The Talos Principle left.\n\nThere is no real story to speak of. All you get are little poetic sentences that sometimes show themselves randomly and they seem to be describing a narrative of sorts. But you shouldn't go in expecting a Talos Principle epiphany.\n\nThe game is divided into lots of small levels. You pick a level and you then have to activate little pink screaming faces to make the exit appear which you must then get to. The brilliance of the game is how you activte the faces is very different for every level. In one level you may have to light or arrange blocks in a specific order, or you might have to explore a maze, or you might have to decypher meaning from weird signs, or you might have to answer a crafty riddle, or you might just have to run away from weird scary faces over an obstacle course. You never know what the hell you will find when entering a new level and that's the game's greatest asset.\n\nI was much more of a fan of the levels involving puzzles rather than the platforming segments, but thankfully it seems none of the levels are locked so you can focus on just playing the levels you like and ignore the rest. The game also doesn't tell you how the level works, you have to discover it out for yourself, but there are usually little hints, like a platform will light up once you stand on it. At times this can feel great as you figure out the new mechanics and their purpose but there was also plenty of times where I felt lost and had to come back to later.\n\nI couldn't find any meaningful sense of progression aside from a tick for completing the level and Steam's achievements. I would like to see more of a reward, such as hidden levels or a hidden story.\n\nThe price seems a little on the high side for when you take into account there's no story and the graphics are dated, so I'd recommend getting it when it's on sale. If you're a fan of FPS puzzles games then this is an insta-buy for your collection.","February 21","true","9.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

It didn't explain much and did not do great in introduction of the puzzles.\n\nNow, a year later after my first impression the game been updated with quite a few fixes. I can't say it improved a lot in terms of clarity, but it certainly been adressed to some degree by the developer, which is a positive thing. I personally still feel that it is a bit on the confusing side, but at this point I would shrug it off to this not being being my type of thing as I can certainly see its abstract appeal.\n\nSome of the puzzles are still somewhat abstract to figure out. Some are logically easy, some are pretty hard leaving you wondering wtf you are supposed to do. Some people like that, and this is a game for them. I am personally on the neutral now, but it deserves a recommendation just because developer keeps updating the game and listening to the feedback.","December 5, 2014","true","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

In order for a puzzle to be solvable, or reasonable for that matter, you need to know what the game wants you to accomplish. Many of the puzzles make sense, but I found myself asking "wait, what do I need to do?" about a doxen too many times. The graphics, and overall feel of the game are good, but there is too little explanation of what the player should be doing.","February 28, 2015","false","1.2"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","9","20","2","5"

I honestly have no idea what is going on in this game. There are many levels I don't know how to solve because there are no instructions or clear objectives. Each level is a different kind of puzzle which wouldn't be so bad if they explained the mechanics better. On top of that some levels don't let you jump or shoot and I have no idea why. I hate to say it but I don't recomnd this game because I honestly have no clue what is happening most of the time.\nBut hey, at least this game looks cool.

The music is also very atmospheric and creepy which suits the game well. That creativity is even more startling when it comes to the gameplay, with every level it seems focusing on something totally different. The biggest challenge is simply figuring out how the levels work, so you need a certain level of experimental skill to even begin to solve them. There is a hint when you enter a level but it's often cryptic, and there were a number of levels where I just had to give up and look at one of the guides to figure out what to do. Some levels then either have a logic based puzzle or are an obstacle course. I wasn't a fan of the obstacle courses, it seems a lot of which focus on platforming, but there are a great many levels and the level selection is open so I could safely focus on the more puzzle orientated levels ignoring those I didn't like.\n\nIf you're a fan of first person puzzle games that require inventive logic to solve then I'd recommend this game. Though bear in mind that many levels use varying levels of "action", such as shooting floating faces that come toward you, or platforming.\n\nI'd recommend you wait for it to go on sale too, since the visual level of polish isn't quite what I expect from a modern game.","December 19, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seems like most of the game is about figuring out how the individual levels mechanically work, of which there's a lot of variety in the gameplay interactions, then you have the added challenge of putting that knowledge into action to reach the exit. I'd recommend it if you're into games like Antichamber where the puzzles are based on creative exploration of the world rather than hardcore logic puzzles. Sadly there aren't many inventive games out there like this which is a shame, so I hope the developers make a sequel that smooths over some of the negatives, like the dated graphics.","January 31","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
