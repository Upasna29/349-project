"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexwojtak/recommended/16120/","alexwojtak","alexwojtak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexwojtak/","191 products in account","This is such a charming simple little game. It's a waiting game, but a game of this type that you just buy, and have, and there's no microtransactions maybe contributes to how peaceful and simple and charming it is. It's essentially a little garden that you tend, and check back in on periodically. You can grow plants, and sell them to buy fertiizer and seeds and other such simple additions, or improve your shop to get more customers.\n\nBut the cornerstone of this game is the cross-breeding. You can cross-pollinate plants with each other to make new species, and those species are created according to specific rules. The game within a game is figuring out what those rules are, so you can eventually create any plant you want. You end up really feeling in control of your virtual garden. It's a beautiful game and I love it to bits.","November 26, 2013","true","27.9"," 38 of 39 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","38","39","0","0"

The plants also grow when you're not playing but you can at anytime on the menu screen make time faster, slower, or pause it if you happen to be too busy to play or free, whice is a plus for me. If you are not into relaxing or simple games, then I wouldn't recommend it.","December 21, 2013","true","44.0"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

Its a time management game so, even if your not playing it the game will still continue to run and continue with the game. But dont worry about that, in the menu you can pause time, make it go slower, or make it go faster. Its a bit hard to make money in the beginning but after a while it speeds up. The graphic's for the customers are a bit old school but that why I love the game. Its an old school time management game and in my opinion its was worth the money. The pictures make the game look more complicated then it really is. Also as a bonus feature in the game you can collect bugs that will appear randomly on your plants every now and then. So you can try and collect all the bugs as a little bonus feature to the game. This game won't take up much of your time and it's a bit addicting so be warned!","July 21, 2015","true","73.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You could approach it systematically (perfect for people who like ticking boxes!) or just have fun breeding random plants and catching bugs. Has lots of additional features, such as time adjustment, hunt for magical plants (with special properties) and mutagenic chemicals ;) One of these games where it's fun to discover things without a guide. There's not too much place for seeds, so plan carefully!","June 10, 2015","true","166.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chillitepache/recommended/16120/","chillitepache","Laz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chillitepache/","28 products in account","This game is very relaxing and fun. You breed+sell plants, catch bugs, and upgrade your equipment. I had it a few years ago and put countless hours into it; now that it's on steam, I expect to put many, many more.\n\nIf you like games that you can run in the background and check in on every once in a while, you'll like this game. If you want to sit there and be doing things constantly, than it might not be for you. It takes real time for your plants to grow and finding all the magic plants takes a lot of patience.","November 24, 2015","true","44.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I think most of you won't. It is an older game that involves real time waiting. It is perhaps one the first of the type of game where you wait for things to happen in games. What really is neat about this game is the breeding part. You can breed different types of plants with different flowers/petals and different types/actual plant types. So you can have a vox (a black flower) cactus, tree, fern, or many other types. Sometime I will edit this review to be more complete.","October 14, 2015","true","126.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
