But well I only have to guess since the game crashes after the launch. can't click on anything !! few others complained about the same issue on the game's facebook page, But no word from the support.\n\nDidn't get any help by posting on the support forum. I have all sort of games on my steam account and this is the first problematic one. Not a nice gift to myself on thanksgiving.","November 27, 2014","false","0.3"," 52 of 59 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","52","59","0","3"

It is a defense game where your base is mobile and moves forward. The player uses the mounted weapons to attack and kill enemies. There are several sorts of enemies, bases and other things to fight but the battles gets very repetitive after a while.\n\nThe base can be upgraded and customized between missions to adapt to the next mission and you unlock new weapons and bases during the campaign that is very long. The weapons can be divided into several groups that are useful against different sorts of enemies and can either be manual or automatic. Manual recharge faster but are otherwise the same as the automatic.\n\nSo far the game can be quite fun, the reason for me not recommending it is the huge amount of bugs. The game starts just fine for me but sometimes during missions my base gets stuck and doesn't advance forward which causes the game not to advance. This happens quite often and restarting the mission doesn't always help. The game gets quite repetitive after a short while too.","February 3, 2015","false","8.1"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","32","35","0","0"

It has progression, different difficulty levels and a wide variety of enemies.  There are plenty of options to defend your moving fortress tower, either automatic or manual firing.\n\nThe main problem I have with this game, is that when enemies come into melee range of your tower, when they die your fortress may stop moving.  This is game breaking, because you cannot move forward to complete the mission, and thus you need to restart or retreat.  This bug happens very often, probably 1 out of 3 times I got into a mission.  It has happened every time in fact in the last mission I am stuck on, in the third map.  It would be nice if they would fix it, but I doubt it, I don't see too much chatter in the community.\n\nOther than that, when playing the game I do enjoy it.  This is a nice change to the tower defense genre. 6/10 Because of bug.","November 29, 2014","true","11.5"," 10 of 46 people (22%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","22","10","46","3","0"

Excellent twist on the traditional stationery tower-defence. Instead, your mobile fortress, mounted on the back of a gargantuan creature is trying to push its way through hordes of enemies to reach the exit, in classic 2D side-scrolling style of yore. Select the squads that will man the towers of your fortress. The archer is great for long range but can't shoot enemies that get in your face. For that you need a short range spear squad. Later, unlock siege or magic squads that are better suited against armoured units or buildings. Play around until you have your ideal combination of squads, and upgrade with additional recruits, giving a faster rate of fire. Replay missions to earn valuable medals, which will allow you to unlock different fortresses, squads and beasts. After 2.5 hours I am hooked.

It’s an interesting take on the genre that plays out very well.  You can expect the following:\n\nExcellent graphics\nDecent Soundtrack\nSolid Gameplay\nThe only thing I didn't like was how slow the game is initially.  The first twelve levels are more of a tutorial and if you stray away from the tutorial like I did (upgraded archers first) you're be left grinding out a few levels to earn enough gold to unlock the other defenses for your roaming fortress.\n\n","December 7, 2014","true","0.5"," 5 of 40 people (13%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","13","5","40","2","0"

You don't need to spent time leveling or building and the non-mmo status leaves you with the ability to really play when you want or have free minutes between the daily drag. If you want a game that has a minimal learning curve and can just be a relaxing 10 minute event this is the game for you.","December 6, 2014","true","3.1"," 3 of 35 people (9%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","9","3","35","2","0"

(like 60ish)\n-Addictive, I'm on level 18 after about 6 hours\n\nCons:\n\n-Game breaking bug where the fortress pauses on level sometimes\n-Missions become repetitive after awhile, the new enemies are fun when they use new concepts. But sometimes they get stuck in the whole - here is the same thing just stronger, click some more blah blah blah.\n-Resource build isn't fun, if you don't make the right weapon selection you have to repeat earlier levels just to get more money. You can get lazy about it though and put fully automated weapons on your beast and let it run and make money that way. = )\n\nAll in all worth the 10 bucks for maybe a good 20 hours of play I'm hoping. I'm at 6 hours so far.","May 29","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
