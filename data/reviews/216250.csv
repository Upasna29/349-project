Riptide addresses a few of these failings but it's essentially more of the same. It starts badly with a clichéd corrupt corporate suit and a conspiracy; thankfully however it's not the plot that drives Dead Island but the exploration, loot and combat. For all its poor writing and characterisation the setting is still superbly realised, a sun-drenched tropical island with just enough variation in locales to keep it interesting. Combined with the great combat and looting and there's still a lot to recommend with Riptide.\n\nApart from fixing a few bugs and being more stable the most noticeable changes to the formula are the addition of new transport, a zombie horde mode which happens at key moments as the story progresses and a handful of new zombie threats.\n\nPros:\n- Very fun to play\n- Co-op\n- Lot of weapons\n- Ability to mod weapons (barbed wire on bat, electric shotgun, etc.)\n- Very long story\n- Big maps\n- Lots of zombies\n- Gore\n\nCons:\n- Not an interesting story\n- Other than the main characters, all other charcters have the same facial animation, just diffrent clothings and voices\n- Grapnics aren't very good\n- Vehicles have terrible physics\n\nI believe both Dead Island and Riptide are best played solo. Playing co-op is a completely different beast. Played solo Riptide is a tense game, one of fear and always looking over your shoulder. Played with friends it turns it into more of a fun fair, who can chop up the zombies faster than the other players with no tension and no sense of fear. So to best experience Dead Island I would recommend you skip the co-op and delve into what is still the best open-world zombie game available.","March 29, 2015","true","15.8"," 216 of 245 people (88%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","88","216","245","12","0"

They are fun and atmospheric. If you like shivers up and down your spine and going in there anyway these games are for you.\n\nRiptide is smaller than the original and maybe a little more polished in the gameplay and pacing. The looting system is more relevant with shops and trading more accessible than in the original game. Buildings and tunnels are refreshingly brief compared to the first game.\n\nCo-op is very smooth. If you join someone else's co-op game and become Player 2 and later on someone else joins as Player 3, when Player 1 subsequently goes home both you and Player 3 continue on together in your own game seamlessly and without hesitation. Smooth as you please.\n\nSome reports on the web make great play on the idea that Riptide is an overwhelming grind of infinitely spawning Infected everywhere you go but I've been through the whole thing twice now and it's just not. There are two places I can think of where a group of three Infected will infinitely respawn after a very short delay and you just hurry past. Learn to hide. Very small deal.\n\nThe only negative point for me is the camera movement when you climb to the top of something, it waves about and can leave you queasy until you get your sea legs for it. This is an unfortunate barrier to entry unless you learn to just look away.\n\nHaving said that, many games leave me seasick when I pick them up again after a long break.\n\nAnd for those who love their Achievements these are all quite doable.","October 24, 2013","true","99.0"," 304 of 365 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","304","365","0","5"

No spoilers.\n\nThe Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.\n\nDead Island Riptide is a great sequel to Dead Island. The hack'n slash is back, but with less bugs and glitches, plus improved visuals. I am going to start right off the bat, I do not like the island Dead Island Riptide takes place on. The jungle is confusing to navigate, and the map that is supposedly suppose to "help" you navigate it, is like some kid vomitted on it. It is literally a blank slate with a player and mission indicator. The island isn't fun to explore, at all. Especially when most of the island is covered with water, which disables you from sprinting and makes you walk slower. Dead Island's resort was more interesting, and easier to navigate. The scenery was also better, and I enjoyed exploring the resort of Banoi.\n\nZombies are a bit overpowered, even when you are facing one that is of your own level. Weapons are hard to come by, and using your fists isn't effective against hoardes. When you find a weapon, you usally just stick with it most of the game because nothing better comes a long. Despite that, you even have to repair the weapons if you use it too much, which isn't always a good thing. It does make it feel more like a survival game, but it makes it hard as ♥♥♥♥ when you are facing a hoarde and that one good weapon you had is about to break. The one weapon I stuck with the beginning 4-5 hours of gameplay was the BBQ. I used nothing else, cause there was literally nothing better.  Finally at level 24 I was able to get a spiked shovel which did pack a punch.\n\nThe weapon crafting is a joke.  It's a mediocre system of gathering supplies, and then add something to a weapon. The thing you add isn't even that good. After getting all the supplies, I could add barbed wire to a paddle. Yippee. It didn't play much different then the normal one either and I ended up going back to my BBQ. The upgrade system for each weapon is nice and simplistic though. Once you have enough money, you can choose which weapon you want to upgrade. This is good for later in the game when zombies become tougher, and I could upgrade my BBQ to do more damage. It isn't a very revolutionary idea, but it did help in the end.\n\nThe story is pretty bad so far. All they tell you when you get on the island is that the way out is through Henderson, a city. Then you get yourself in a bunch of random quests mashed together until finally a guy will, let's say, let you into their safe area. Then after that, the same thing happens. You have to go talk to some person but they won't do what you went there to ask them in the first place until you "help" them, and by that I mean more random missions.\n\nNow after all this negativity, why am I still recommending the game? The gameplay. Hackin' zombies is hella fun in this game. It does get repetitive, but it is satisfying when you dismember their arms or slash off a head. There are various types of zombies too which keeps it interesting, such as one that literally will commit suicide and kill you if you are in range. Also, the game is pretty cheap too.\n\nVerdict: 7/10\n\nDead Island Riptide is a game worth getting if you have never played it and are looking for a good zombie slashin' game. It's fairly cheap, and the gameplay is interesting enough to get lots of fun out of it.\n\nThanks for listening, mates.","October 24, 2014","true","5.0"," 169 of 205 people (82%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","82","169","205","12","9"

The survivors of the first game meet a new playable character, John Morgan who is also immune to the infection. The ship wrecks on the shores of Palanai after being overrun and the survivors find themselves in a similar predicament to the one on Banoi.\n\nQuests in Riptide are ripped strait from Ye Olde Grimoire of RPG quest design, that leans heavily on taking the longest possible route in getting from point A to point B. For example, a character wants you to rescue her from a flooded basement where a shorted out fuse box is electrifying the water. Of course the front door is locked so you have to kill half a dozen zombies so that you can find the an access point on the roof. Once there, you find the fuse box is locked and you have to kill the keyholder so that you can open the box. Most RPGs reserve this kind of design for optional tasks but it's a staple of the games main quests as well. Without any character development or world building side quests become real life chores when tackled alone. The only reprieve from this antiquated quest design comes from the new hold out missions. These quests emphasize Riptide's co-op gameplay by having your characters fortify and defend a position.\n\nDeadzones are instanced areas that contain a boss or special infected. Riptide contains around two dozen of these areas and they have one of five layouts so it isn't long before these sequences come off as boring cut and paste filler content. The bosses themselves are just special infected that are given some sort of additional buff resulting in thugs that move as fast as infected and Butchers that regain heath after successful strikes. Speaking of special infected, several new types have been added. Screamers make a horrendous noise that prevents your character from attacking, wrestlers are large freaks with a club like arm and a tremendous amount of health and grenadiers are zombies in hazmat suits that throw toxic body parts at you. These new additions are welcome but with so many other zombie games you will come away with the sensation that you have fought these enemies elsewhere.\n\nMelee combat has gone largely unaltered with the exception of an ability that allows you to drop on top of enemies if you are in an elevated position. Also the ability to level each weapon type has been added. Each level unlocks a perk such as additional experience or reduced stamina use. Outdoor environments in Riptide look pretty decent. The character models don't fare so well however. They appear waxy with poorly animated faces and cold dead eyes. Some of the textures on their clothing can also be woefully low res. The gore and viscera are appreciable though as the flesh of your foes can be burnt and hacked away, reacting to the type of weapon you use. Indoor instances suffer from really bland lighting that is devoid of softness or nuance.  It does little to enhance the atmosphere and since the game isn't very scary to being with relying on your flashlight and flares does little to create tension. Also some areas are missing textures. The soundtrack fares better though with a mix of synth and piano that evoke the soundtracks of Lucio Fulci's zombie flicks from the late 1970's and early 1980's. The music succeeds in conveying the desperation and futility of surviving that neither the narrative nor the gameplay are equipped to convey. Sound effects are solid and some of the roars and cries from the undead can be unnerving. As for the voice acting, well, lets just say it matched the cold, dead eyes of the NPC character models perfectly...","November 25, 2013","true","35.8"," 111 of 140 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","111","140","0","1"

You can play through multiple times as the different characters and it offers a slightly different experience, due to the individual characters perspective.  If it is on sale and you enjoy Zombie Survival games, it might be worth a shot for you. It does get somewhat repetitive, but the characters are interesting to a point so it is at least entertaining.

Despite the old engine the ingame picture looks fantastic (by release date ofc). Locations became much more bigger, devs added lots of new zombie types. There's new transport - boats. Driving them and smashing drowners at the same time is insane! One more thing to mention is that there's a load of quests... Man! 80. God. Damn. Quests. And also there's a new playable character appeared - John Morgan.\nRiptide is mostly co-op focused, but if you don't have a partner it won't be lost, you won't be bored. The game is as good in singleplayer as in co-op, at least it'd be better to chose singleplayer neither co-op with a random partner.\nIn addition, when you just stalking this island it seems that it's alive, full of life (dead one anyway). It's not like most of open world games, here the world is not statical, everytime you do something it changes. When you complete the story, it will be still interesting to run around this island once more and more...\nOf cons I can mention only small nuber of bugs and not very interesting plot, just like a typical zombie survival drama.","November 25, 2013","true","23.3"," 74 of 96 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","74","96","0","0"

In Dead Island 1 you leave a prison and that is where Dead Island Riptide begins.  The same cast of playable characters is included along with a new character named Logan, meaning if you want to hear all the fun quotes maybe play through the game 5 times.  The game can be as short or as long as you want it to be which makes it very fun and easy to play.

The modding, co-op, missions, world, cutting zombies to pieces or using a electrified hammer to explode their body into a wall. It was amazing and maybe one of my favorite zombie themed games.\n\nBut this one.. It has some improvements, but too many flaws. This could have been better than Dead Island, and maybe most co-op games.\n\nPro's:\nThe story is much better than the first game, the modded weapons are cool looking and you can use a ♥♥♥♥ing golf club as a weapon.. that is amazing. lol.\n\nI love the new character John, I was wishing there was a hand to hand fighter in Dead Island, and now I have one. He has great abilities with claws, and a powerful kick to knock zombies far away to get some space. The character are well made, even feel like they have a bit more personality now.\n\nIf you use Xian, in the first game blunt weapons aren't too great for you. But now, you can level up 4 different skills with weapons.\n(EXAMPLE: My John is skilled with guns, hand to hand and blades now. I just have more of a bonus with claws over the rest.)\nThis opens up your choices on how to make blood rain from above than before.\n\nGuns. They are now actually useful!! Though ammo is rare, you can actually do real damage to zombies with guns if you do headshots, unlike the first game where they barely did anything unless you were purna(and even then, it wasn't all that much better.)\n\nI actually saw in a cutscene when asked about being immune, John states that the rest are at the base, instead of having invisible ninja survivors with you that don't show up in the game, until a major cutscene.\n\nAll this is great, and so much of a improvement but here are why the score is so low.\n\nCon's:\n\nLets start with the most basic complaint for people. The frame rate. I see people complain it is bad. Which I can agree.. Then you get people who say it runs fine for them. Great so because 1 out of 50 people says it works fine, means the game is fine. No.\n\nDead Island ran fine. But Riptide runs at half speed unless my resolution is 800/600 and windowed. Which I can deal with, games aren't about looks, its about the gameplay.\n\nThe game feels terrible unbalanced. Zombies kill you within a few hits, and if they throw a throwing weapon at you, there is a 90% chance its a 1 hit kill. (stabbed no, thrown yes.) and they rarely miss.\n\nThe new mutations look amazing, and very nice, but I have a complaint for 2 types.\nThe Screamer, she is faster than you, kills you quickly, her screams stuns you from attacking, and even if you are hitting her, she can scream. Her only weakness, is low health. So if you can get the drop on her quickly you can be ok..\n\nsecond, the named zombies.. They can't be knocked down, slow down, they are basically like a butcher and thug combined. Very unbalanced and unfair, especially when they are surrounded by a army of walkers.\n\nThis game is riddled with bugs. Remember all the bugs in dead island? Well, double it. Did no one beta test it? I killed a army of zombies, then when I had to kill the "boss" zombie, they all respawned behind me. I have lost thrown weapons, I have used fury then my character froze in place until I was killed.\nI had 2 roofs that had a endless spawn of zombies when I checked the roof, they only had 3 on them.\n\nWhen I blow up a suicider over 40 steps away, its explosion has a chance of hittings me and killing me.\n\nAnd many more issues to it. It had potential to be one of the best games I played, but it was abandoned too quickly, and we were left with a bug infested game that is fun, but all fun can be cut short any second by a unfair glitch.","September 22, 2015","false","87.9"," 107 of 151 people (71%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","71","107","151","12","17"

The real question you need to ask yourself is how many zombies in your lifetime do you want to kill at close range. Take that number and keep multiplying it until you get bored and you have this experience. Dead Island Riptide is the continuation of the original Dead Island where the four survivors from the original game are thrown into the fire once again with a fifth playable character. For those who are unaware, Dead Island Riptide is no different than its predecessor, it is a single player and cooperative open world, first person melee combat game against the living dead and a few other mutants.\n\nI'll start with the good, the graphics are beautiful from far away. You have gorgeous green vistas, crystal water and a sunny day, unless its raining. The setting is gorgeous, even if its a zombie action game set in broad daylight with no nighttime to be found outside of the first mission. Upon closer inspection the textures might not be as beautiful and the character models of the living can be worse than those of the dead.\n\nThe game plays well enough for any melee focused game. There's an attack or shoot button, an aim button for when you want to aim your gun or take aim with a weapon to throw it. You also have typical sprint, jump and squat buttons for traversing the area. Dead Island Riptide is a stamina game, so you need to pace your zombie beat downs. Run out of stamina and you'll be ineffective. Everything costs stamina except shooting guns.\n\nOutside of running and walking, there are boats and jeeps to take you where you're headed. Its fun to just sit back, mow down some zombies or even let another player drive. The boat has a speed boost to ram zombies, otherwise they can pull someone off. You'll also find fast travel and there is a big map and a mini map so you can find the are you're looking for.\n\nThere's a rhythm to attacking enemies, hit them and wait for them to telegraph their attacks, then step back. Repeat, repeat, repeat. You will unlock abilities as you level your character that introduce game changing attacks such as uppercuts and running kicks. The unlocked attacks feel good. Kicking a zombie off a cliff or even into a wall feels brutal, effective and fun to watch. Zombies will both charge at you or shamble around. Others lay in wait pretending to be dead, especially floaters in the water.\n\nSure I say melee focused game, there are guns, pistols, assault rifles, nail and flare guns, but the ammunition costs money or its rare to come by. Its just easier to use your fists, knives and blunt objects. There are even a few throwable weapons to keep things interesting. Molotiv cocktails, grenades and the like. Throwing a bladed weapon feels satisfying when it severs an arm or lops a head off. The knives get stuck in your foes and you can pull it out of their bodies to attack them again. Zombies will get up in your grill, grab you and you need to push one button then press another before a timer expires to deck them back.\n\nYour combat does feel fluid, your movements feel fluid for the most part. Other times you can feel drunk as your character bobs and weaves. Just because you've stopped means your character's body has to stop or even start for that matter. It takes a while to get used to it.\n\nEverything is a former human. The zombies were people, the thug zombies were tall people, the ogres were crazy old men, the vomit spitting husky gents were people and the boil covered exploders were also people who are now mutated and discusting. You'll be killing your fellow human beings over and over again. That's not to guilt trip you, but that's just to say you're doing the same thing constantly. As I played it became an issue to constantly engage myself into fights. I'd avoid fights like you would in a real zombie apocalypse. Why fight an enemy when its just easy to avoid them? Wall of zombies? Jump kick through them. Fighting when you have to reduces the tedium.\n\nWith no field of view slider, you'll often have tunnel vision and you'll be unaware of the zombies sneaking up behind you as you're curb stomping a victim. I for one feel bad for the zombies. I feel like a mugger that's just beating down the welcome wagon and stealing their cash. Why am I stealing their cash? To purchase upgrades. Yes there are tool benches that you can repair, upgrade and craft new weapons. Why does an unmanned tool bench require money? Because its the honor system of course. The game never mentions it, but I just assume that's the case. I like to fill in the blanks with the story, because there are a lot of them.\n\nThe story continues where the last one left off. You're aboard a naval vessel in rough waters that just so happens to be invested with flesh eating zombies. Things quickly go wrong and the ship serves as a brief tutorial before you're dropped off on a different part of Panama that is stricken with the same plague. Your objective is to go mission after mission to get a boat to get out of the area before its bombed. Well that is the start of the plan, then from there, you can do what you want. All of the people you rescue, help and aide will perhaps die anyway in the bombing that might happen. I never stuck around for the end of the game, because like most open world games, you do it at your leisure, so if you never complete it, does it really get bombed?.\n\nThe game feels like an easy enough single player experience, but the game gets even easier with online multiplayer. You'll receive a notice that someone else is in the area and you can accompany them and complete the mission together and go from there. I think it adds a lot of life to the game, although some people are completely clueless and its shocking how they got so far. Another thing that I took note of is everyone's microphone is on always. I've overheard completely other conversations from people that are oblivious their microphone hears everything with no filter. Riptide does streamline things, you can have one player go to the objectives and the others can warp to that person instantly.\n\nThere are five characters and they all play the same, but come with different abilities. Things like Logan can retrieve all thrown weapons. Xian lets you backstab for more damage. Sam B can ram and tackle enemies, rather than the football playing Logan. John is a master of unarmed combat and learns weapons quicker, and Purna can heal herself and the group. Each of the five is better with different forms of combat. Everything from unarmed combat to blunt weapons. Each of these can be leveled up over time.\n\nYou'll find little bugs and glitches here and there, but nothing game breaking. Characters will talk without moving their mouth. The animations can be laughably lifeless. You can kick a zombie into a ragdoll and watch as their arm gets caught in mid air and they're pulled up. All of these things are forgivable and enhance the game. There are horde mode missions where you first need to fortify a fortress and then survive an onslaught of zombies.\n\nThe think that hinders the game is just how much of it is tedium. Go here, get this and bring it back. When you're here, there are zombies, when you're there, you'll find zombies and when you come back, you'll find leprechauns, but no there are just zombies. There's also no true death in Riptide. Every death respawns you with less cash ensuring that you will always persevere as long as you put more time in.\n\nThe original Dead Island is the game with all of the fame, while Riptide was just squeezed out with little fanfare. The hype was gone and dead from the original and its more an issue that people can only stand so much melee combat before they want more. Riptide is still a good game, its just tough to recommend with its repetition and lack of variety.","September 19, 2015","false","11.0"," 43 of 61 people (70%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","70","43","61","10","3"

Dead Island then back bigger and meaner than before: its delicate formula hybrid revived without alterations but with boundaries expanded into a boundless playground for zombie hunters. Lovers of the first chapter, probably, could not have asked for anything better but the imprecision of the combat system and the general flatness of quests are still in place in Riptide. As well as the good system of character progression, crafting and the fun from addressing the multiplayer game, on the other hand. A compromise that seems part of the composite identity of this real cult weblog Techland, just wish the freshness of the original, after two years, is now inexorably lost.\n","December 22, 2015","true","175.2"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","34","46","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/216250/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","212 products in account","It starts promisingly enough: a mad dash off a sinking ship, a military coup, and a zombie horde just aching to be shown the business end of a shotgun. And then, just like that, the promise is taken away. Dead Island: Riptide teases far more in its opening minutes than it ever manages to deliver across its lengthy campaign. There's no drama, and little excitement. Instead, there's a rehash of old ideas, combat that's fun for all of five minutes, and a seemingly never-ending slog of repetitive missions filled with characters that have the emotional depth of a wet sponge. If there were ever a video game equivalent of smacking your head against a brick wall, Riptide would be it.\n\nThe story--and that's using the word generously--is filled with the sort of terrible dialogue, hammy voice acting, and cliches you'd expect to see in an awful zombie spoof, or at best, a trashy B movie. But there's no sense of humour or self-awareness here: to Riptide's detriment, it takes itself very seriously. And that seriousness is hard to swallow when you have to look after a bunch of shallow, argumentative characters who utter irritating swears every few minutes and prove so unlikable that you're willing them to be torn apart by the zombie horde, just so you can have some peace and quiet. Then there's the plot itself, which endlessly meanders between government conspiracy, sci-fi, and human interest, without even the slightest sense of direction.\n\nThis all makes it so very hard to care about anything that happens in Riptide. By the time you drag yourself through to the disappointing ending, apathy has taken over to the point where you wouldn't bat an eyelid at even the most grand of revelations. And that's only if you can muster up enough energy to make it that far. Riptide's sandbox island of Hanoi isn't filled with the fun zombie-killing adventures you might expect. Instead, there are fetch quests: lots of fetch quests. And within those fetch quests are yet more fetch quests.\n\nNearly every single one of the main missions and side quests requires you to head over to a part of the island, find an item, and bring it back to base. Often, before you can retrieve said item, the game makes you fetch something for the person who holds the item, thus creating a fetch quest within a fetch quest. What's more, the narrative reasoning behind each quest is questionable. Why some stranded villager might be after a few measly bucks when the entire island has been overrun with flesh-eating zombies that threaten the very existence of humankind is puzzling.\n\nTo make matters worse, the combat that ties the whole thing together remains largely unchanged from that of Dead Island, which is to say it's massively frustrating. The focus is on melee weapons, ranging from blunt objects like baseball bats and shovels, through to blades like carving knives and sickles. Most can be upgraded using items scavenged from around the island, with hidden blueprints giving you access to wilder designs. And initially at least, bludgeoning a zombie to death with an improvised, nail-covered baseball bat is amusing, thanks to the resulting blood splatters, severed limbs, and grisly sound effects.\n\nThe limitations of the combat soon become clear, though. Attacking zombies still feels wildly inaccurate, slow, and very dull, making it difficult to truly master. The result is that the combat quickly deteriorates into a repetitive mess as you kick a zombie backward, flail randomly at it, back off while it attacks, and then repeat the whole process ad nauseam. A stamina bar ensures you can't just spam an attack--particularly when you're using heavier weapons that drain the bar faster--but rather than giving the game a more realistic feel, it just further enhances the dull combat.\n\nThe vast majority of the zombies you face attack in the same way, rushing towards you until you knock them back with a kick to start the dull attack process. There are some special zombies that remain unchanged from those in Dead Island, including charger, spitter, and boomer types; they have slightly different movesets here, but you end up tackling them in exactly the same way, because your options are so limited. For a game so focused on combat, it's galling that you spend most of your time wanting to avoid zombies, just so you can spare yourself the resulting tedium.\n\nUsing a vehicle to get around takes some of the edge off of that tedium, because ploughing through groups of zombies in a jeep or cutting through them in a rickety old boat is far quicker than melee. Inevitably, though, you're still forced to engage in hand-to-hand combat once you reach your destination. Guns do arrive much later, but the weedy, inaccurate shooting isn't something to look forward to. Neither are Riptide's few horde missions, where you must protect your base from an onslaught of evil zombies. You can put up fences, lay mines, and take on a few side quests (of the fetch variety, naturally) in order to strengthen your defences, but it's all moot: just repeat your trusty "kick, swipe, back off" pattern a few hundred times, and the job's done.\n\nYour reward for the hard combat slog is experience points, which are used to level up your character and unlock new skills, such as increased weapon accuracy and faster recovery times. Not that they make a whole lot of difference to the way the game plays, mind: it's all about keeping your level up to that of the zombies around you so you can fetch those items for other characters. Fortunately, levelling up is swift thanks to generous XP allocations, frequent checkpointing, and a death system that gives you unlimited lives, with the only penalty being the loss of cash you may have earned during missions or scrounged from the environment.\n\nRiptide's role-playing game elements mean that as much as you might want to, you can't avoid combat entirely. But then, even if you did, what you'd be left with is a shallow husk of a storyline and an irritating cast of characters that you'd much rather see turned into a bloody mess than offered rescue. Not to mention that if you played the original Dead Island, there's not much new to see here. There's so little to like in Riptide that mustering up the enthusiasm to reach the lacklustre ending is a challenge for only the most hardcore of zombie fans to take on.\n\nAnd don't try enlisting a few friends for some four-player co-op: it doesn't make the game any more exciting. Sure, having a few friends around makes those hordes disappear a little faster, and there are some extra quests you can take on, but the core experience remains as glacial as ever. Riptide is dumb, and mind-numbingly slow, and somehow manages to make the art of zombie-slaying feel like utter tedium. And if slaying zombies isn't fun in a game that's all about slaying zombies, why bother?\n\n1 person upvoted this review.\nDead Island: Riptide\nDead Island: Riptide / PC\n\nTHE GOOD\nCool blood effects and dismemberments\n\nTHE BAD\nBoring, repetitive missions\nWeak voice acting and dialogue\nSoulless, irritating characters\nFrustrating combat\n\n4/10","April 10","false","2.5"," 97 of 156 people (62%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","62","97","156","19","4"

WOW\nI was never Dead Island fan, it changed when I got my hands on Dead Island: Epidemic, but thats different story.\nSimply, this game caught me, and it does not want to let me go! I did not even finish original DI..cmon Riptide... but I fell in love with this game.\nWhat do I think:\nThe story is catchy, pretty catchy. (I dont understand why everybody says it is not, I found original DI story boring, not this one) Lot of plot twists, thats what I like. And a new character, maybe that is the reason why I tryied this game, because John Morgan is someone I deeply sympathize with.\nGameplay is pretty much the same, game has same mechanics as the original one, but now, you can have a boat! Ima on a boat..yeeaaah. Deal with it XD\n+ Still the same awesome co-op mode\nGame also showed us 3 new big mosters, Floater, Screamer and Wrestler. Also zombies behave more aggresive way than before. Zombieeess.... XD\nBugs? Yep, I found some. This game taught me one thing: never try to raft a boat between rock and a tree, never again.\nAlso, in some quest, zombies you need to kill sometimes vanish through closed doors you cant open and get literally "stuck" nowhere and you cant reach them.\nAnd one time NPCs tried to give a quest from beginning of the game. These quest can be triggered, but cannot be completed and will disappear when you try to track them.\nFor the end: I was lazy to write proper review for this one. BUT, THIS is the best game I have played in a long time. And the ending was so open that it need another game.

Same dead channel!" 7/10\n\n'Riptide' is an excellent follow up to the original 'Dead Island' game, and even though it's essentially the same thing with a continued storyline, it was just as much fun playing through as the original. The change in atmosphere, the more cinematic cut-scenes, added waterboats, and new enemies are great additions and make 'Riptide' worth experiencing even if you think you know what the game already has to offer.\n\nOne of the best parts about this series is how long it takes to actually get some god damn firearms. I'm sure that's a huge turn-off for some people, but I love clawing my way through horde after horde with just my bare hands and some pipes to get to the good stuff. 'Riptide' has more of a focus on firearms than 'Dead Island', but the grinding to find them isn't lost at all. 'Riptide' is also far less punishing when it comes to how quickly your weapons break apart. So there's always that.\n\nAs for the story, it's pretty much what you'd expect, cheesy dialogue from a group of misfit characters trying to escape the island to save their lives, and the music feels like it'd be right at home in an 80's slasher flick. There's also plenty to do; mostly find this, find that, go here, go there, save him, save her, but despite the repetition in quests, it never felt like I was doing the same thing over and over again. 'Riptide' is definitely worth picking up during the next sale.","November 12, 2014","true","17.1"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","21","29","0","0"

The only thing they changed was the combat system and all they did was add levels for specific weapons and new weapons. The story sucks and is drawn out.The voice acting sucks. All the quests are pretty much "get me x and ill give you y". I'm pretty sure there's less quests in this game than the first. One thing that annoys me is how in the first game there's multiple groups of people in different places, so there are more side quests. In this one you just move from place to place with your group, so there's pretty much no side quests. The environment sucks in this game. The city is awful compared to the first one. Unless there's a story quest you don't run into bandits. The jungle is flooded with little boats so you have to walk extremely slow in the water. The game feels rushed consisting of a lot of bugs. They could have added so much to make the game good but they just made Dead Island 1.5.\n\n\nWhy you should wait for a massive price cut or avoid altogether:\n\n1. If you were severely disappointed by the first one and told yourself you'd only buy a sequel if they made improvements because the ones made (fire weapons actually give light in this game) are minimal and not a enough to warrant a purchase.\n\n2. Glitches abound\n\n3. The story defeats itself on many levels (it's also boring and confusing)\n\n4. There is zero improvement on the combat mechanics\n\n5. Zombies respawn even after rooms and spaces have been cleared\n\n6. You were hoping for more "survival horror" elements; they were nearly completely removed from this game","December 4, 2013","false","22.6"," 196 of 357 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","196","357","0","23"

Sure I loved the first Dead Island, but Riptide doesn't improve anything that needed improving. And to me seems worse.\n\nWith some minor improvements such as alcohol, molotov's grenades no longer taking up inventory space and there are now specific weapons classed as throwing which also don't waste inventory space, such as throwing knives.\n\nI like that I could import my lvl 52 character.\n\nStory was not as good as the first and neither were the locations,  weren't as interesting or as fun to explore. Walking slowly through flooded jungle becomes tiresome. It feels more like a tunnel than open world.\n\nDislike that still guns can only be found in later lvls,  nor can you store excess ammo in your inventory, can only have maximum in your gun and that's it.\n\nFor completing a mission my lvl 70 character is awarded a purple lvl 15 pistol. Rewards should be equivalent to my characters lvl.\n\nI carried a fuel container to a petrol bowser and left it there and went into the nearby bungalow which loaded as a seperate zone and fought some killer zombie and came out and my fuel container was not there anymore, it was listed as back where I picked it up from. Really annoying that when you go into bungalows and caves they load as a seperate area and when you go back out everything is reset including zombies, cars and items.\nThis is really annoying, that I have to trek all that way again.\n\nAlso going into another zone such as a building and out again will cause the side quest you were tracking to change to tracking the main quest instead.\n\nOrdinary Walker Zombie's can one hit kill very accurately by throwing a weapon at you. A bit ridiculous and contradictory considering they aren't smart enough to climb a ladder, but are smart enough to use and throw a knife at you. Zombies are meant to be mindless and it takes a being with a mind and reason to be able to use a weapon. (I know zombies could throw weapons in the first game, but that didn't result in 1 hit kills with full health).\n\nRespawns are way too fast.\n\nI clear an area and zombies respawn moments later. They seem to make respawns in Riptide way too fast. I liked how it was In the first game, the area would stay clear for quite a long while.\n\nStill no autosave added, not being able to save when you want is a pain, the game only saves when you quit or reach cheackpoints. I exited the game after the survivors moved from Paradise camp to Halai Village, but when I reloaded my game I was not in Halai village which is SE, for some stupid reason my character was all the way fartherest south west point in Pearl Sands. It should leave your character where you quit. Not on the total opposite side of where your character last was. Quitting and reloading  has the problem of not knowing where your character will be as it's often not where you last were.\n\nThere's too many annoying things that make Riptide not as fun as the first.\nThe game was sort of fun, but also frustrated me alot and took patience to be able to endure the frustrating elements, it felt like a backward step with this game instead of forward.\n\nI'd rate it 6/10","July 21, 2015","false","52.0"," 25 of 40 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","25","40","4","6"

Yes, due to these changes I definitely had more fun than in the first part but piercing feeling of experiencing deja vu didn't leave me almost to the end. Riptide is playable, it can give quite a lot of fun. However, this is clearly the production aimed at people who are fans of the original Dead Island and they simply want to have more of the same. The others have a big chance to confuse these two games. You know what? It's shame that Dead Island: Riptide wasn't the first one.

It's much better experience now. Much smoother too. Story for me personally was not that great. Locations were promising at first, but later on it turned out to be copy/paste of some of them from the first game.\n\nRiptide will allow you to import save from your first game and continue with talents from that point. However all your weapons will be gone. Best weapons will come either from quests or metal chests found in game - though that's so rare that I found only one in whole playthrough. Upgrading is a must as well as making some mods if you want most damage.\n\nQuest wise, this game is not as good as first one in my opinion. Often you will be asked to bring some stuff to NPC or save location from rushing horde of zombies.\n\nFor an Expansion, 10 hour span of almost complete quests is not that bad I guess, but not at full price. After all this is just an expansion with not much new stuff, but rather prolonged story of original Dead Island.  Though completion of the game was only 50% mind you, so if you are looking for perfect run it will take more time.\n\nCo-Op was completely fine. We finished game duo. It's fun if you can find fun in anything besides main features of the game. Otherwise it's straight forward - slash zombies, turn in, slash more zombies, jump on them, kick them, hit them with a car, with motorboat, with ... you get the point ...\nWhen it comes to joining others, game does good job at that too, even with bizare level differences.\n\nSadly once you decide to finish main story you can't go back to finish all quests. Game is fair and asks you do you want to finish story however. If you do decide to do so, you will have to play all over again with current character progress.\n\nFinally, just like I wrote in first sentance - if you liked original Dead Island you will love this expansion too. If you didn't like Dead Island you wont find anything different in Riptide.","September 16, 2014","true","11.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

These additions do very little to change the Dead Island experience: if you didn't like Dead Island before, Riptide won't make you a fan. If you did enjoy Dead Island though, Riptide is more of the same but a little bit better.\n\nAfter a brief prologue on a doomed naval ship, Riptide dumps players on another tropical island of the undead and tasks them with escaping. To do this, many fetch quests will have to be undertaken and many more zombies will have to be slain in the most violent ways possible. Fetching and killing grants experience points (XP), which is used to upgrade your character's skills. Anyone who played Dead Island with be right at home with Riptide.\n\nLike in Dead Island, Riptide focuses fairly heavily on melee combat and it still looks and sounds brutal, with limbs, heads, and blood flying all over the place. Weapons can be upgraded to inflict various types of damage (bleeding, fire, poison, etc.) and zapping and frying zombies and watching them twitch and scream is morbidly satisfying.\n\nGuns and ammo are much more plentiful this time around and firearms are a bit more satisfying to shoot when compared to the first game. An increase in the amount of workbenches and merchants also means you're never too far from a freshly-upgraded and repaired weapon.\n\nRiptide's two new main gameplay elements are boats and siege missions. Motor boats are needed to traverse the flooded areas of the island; they're much like the driveable trucks, only now the floaty handling is intentional. Zombies can be run over with the boats, and sometimes they'll pull themselves onto the watercraft and drag you overboard unless you beat them at a life-or-death minigame. Boats are featured heavily in the first half of the game, but once you make it to the island's main town you'll never use one again.\n\nSiege missions in Riptide are much like the zombie modes in other popular games. In these, you have to barricade your location and fend off zombies for a pre-determined amount of time. Siege missions are fun for a bit, but they drag on way too long and become boring after a while. Luckily, there aren't very many of them.\n\nThe one other new thing in Riptide worth mentioning is the new playable character. He's essentially Wolverine from X-Men and can unleash powerful punches and kicks. This guy is fun to play around with, but if you don't want to use him you can play as one of the returning characters or import your levelled-up character from the original game.\n\nRiptide's new enemies are passable but nothing to get excited about. You can rest assured that they're completely original creations and weren't ripped off from Left 4 Dead, though. The returning zombies are identical to their Dead Island counterparts, as they don't seem to have any new animations or sound effects. They are basically pallette-swaps, with different colored clothes.\n\nThis recycling theme runs throughout Riptide: it's painfully obvious to anyone who played Dead Island that many character models, voice clips, art assets, sound effects, and animations in Riptide were taken straight from the original game byte-for-byte and not changed. Riptide borrows from itself too, with lots of copy-and-pasted rooms. One location even features multiple whiteboards with the exact same hand-written message on each. To make matters worse, some of these whiteboards are positioned right next to each other. That's just lazy.\n\nRiptide really *is* more of the same. Often literally.\n\nDespite these issues, Riptide is still fun. The environment is atmospheric, and lots of time can be spent exploring it. Zombie-killing is still visceral (just as long as you're using a controller), and building the best character to effectively kill the undead will take some work and experimentation. Sound effects are great (not surprising, since 90% off the audio effects were taken from Dead Island), and the awful voice-acting and dialog are good for some unintentional laughs. The story is zombie-movie cliche (What's that you say? The zombie outbreak is the result of a biological warfare experiment gone wrong? Shocking!) and full of stock characters you won't remember the names of, but the fact that it takes itself so seriously makes everything that much more enjoyable.\n\nAt least the absurdity brought some extra stability along with it, as Riptide is generally a more stable experience than Dead Island: there aren't nearly as many bugs (although there are still some, like quest items not spawning) and weapons don't disappear into the ground nearly as much as they used to. Zombies still clip through walls and each other, but again not quite as much as before. The interface has also gotten a bit of a facelift, and it's less cumbersome to navigate.\n\nDead Island: Riptide is like pizza: too much of it is bad for you, but you can't resist having just a little bit more. Even if it's the exact same pizza you were eating a few months ago.","December 5, 2013","true","69.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Here are mine. ( Personally) This game has motion blur on throughout the game and I have no idea how to turn it off. This game is great but not as great as the first Dead Island. The story is carried onto from Dead Island 1; same old *loveheart* about busting your way through the map from start to end.\nSome main task are very boring aswell and also when I chose to play sidetasks I would think to myself WHY IS IT EVEN IN THE GAME? What a waste of time..\n( Seriously, the sidetasks are pointless.)\n\nAnyways, this game also has little good to it, wew. You can use guns! Mod weapons.. Drive cars + boats.. Nothing too extreme but guess what!!! The guns becomes useless LATER ON!! So you'd have to use that blunt stick you have to poke the zombie right in the head.  No seriously.. The guns become useless later on in the game. You put an effort to getting ammo but when you try to shoot strong opponents they are *loveheart* invulnerable. It's better killing it with a strong modded weapon.\n\nTo sum up, this is pretty much like Dead Island one but the story isn't as great in my opinon.\nAnd I forgot there a glitches.\n6/10 but still is good, just "GOOD".","May 6","true","91.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It took all the aspects that I felt made the first game weak, and fixed them. Where to start? Let's start with the regular positives. Like the first game, it is gorgeous! There are more shinies to find and many many mods to make your weapons even more fun to take care of those peskering zombies. You also get to transfer your character from the first game, with all their stats. YAY!\nNow the stuff they changed, and they changed and added A LOT! While you still do lots of fetch quests, its not boring. For a change you actually feel you are part of a group. As you fetch items for your fellow immune protagonists and the survivors, it ups your offensive and defensive stats, making you a stronger force when the horde tries to storm your safehouse. This happens various times in key transition points in the game, but you actually see Logan, Sam B, and Purna fighting along side you, along with the other survivors that you help along the way. This makes single player mode feel that you are not alone. I dare say though that this game would still make for a fun multiplayer (I have not played multiplayer). Another positive is the variety of zombies you get to fight. Though you do kill mostly walkers, there are now mutated zombies that prove to be quite the challenge.\nNow for the singular negative: the ending. The story wasn't strong to begin with, but it had some interesting twists as it went along. So, the story itself was passable. The ending is open to interpretation as evidenced by many online forums. Everyone has their own view of what happened. My view is that the ending is extremely pessimistic. Hopefully all questions about what happens at the end of the game will be answered in Dead Island 2.\nThis was a great game, despite the cliffhanger of an ending. It was a fun single player experience and I know that someday I will go back and play as the other protagonists just so I can play this again.","February 22, 2015","true","69.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","2"

But i have had some fun experiences with this game. Being the short zombie Island exploring game that it is, it has much to offer in terms of exploration and side quests aplenty! But note this is an easily short game to binge with others. the ammount of content on offer only goes so far!\nThis game has an avergage length of 34 hours to 100% complete\nMeanwhilte its predessecor has an average time of 46 hours (At least for me.)\nThe point im trying to make is that if you are looking for any slither of replayability here...good luck.\nEnough Briefing, time to boil it down to... The Pros and Cons\n\nPros:+Original Setting that really nails the tropical environment. (Palanai has 2 main maps and a smaller main-mission area Palanai Mainland, Henderson and Pinai\n+Lots of new and improved upgrades! Good for players who liked the blueprints in the first game. The arsenal is expanded to hold various new Zombie Killing Tools! From a Harpoon-gun to Right hand of gloVA (Dev weapon)\n+New character to play as! an Australian Badass known as Sergeant John Morgan.\n+Locations for the main quest are well suited to the Environment around you.\n+Continuation from the First game is simple (Too simple..) and easy to get into.\n+Co-Op mode is a must try, it really makes the game a lot more fun! Also you can revive them, trade with them, Create competitions and drive together. It mainly improves the length of riptide's playing life. Also due to the story it makes more sense to have a full team playing all together. (Because they all show up in cutscenes!).\n+Explosions and special effects like headshots and simple decapitations look good on normal/high settings. Much,much better than the first game.\n+The Skill tree and levelling up in general is handled slowly but is more detailed and rewarding than the first game. The best thing about this is that if you have save data from DI1, you can continue playing with that character! (XP and story only.)\n+Collectibles reveal a lot more about the locations that the story cant explain. Some audio logs make references to the events of the first game even.\n+It is quite addictive! once you have finished the story you feel obligated to do some sidequests and defeat special enemies to "squeeze" out the remaining content!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=448068305\nCons:-So many damn gameplay issues! What use is introducing new weapons to the game if they break after 20 hits!? also why introduce weapons that are only obtainable after you have completed all the missions?\n-Motion blur is a big pain! introduce yourself to the visual and auio settings, you will be staying for a while!\n-Quests are boring and some feel like you make no impact whatsoever. Main quests should NOT give players this feeling!\n-Why the heck are bloody fetch quests still here?? go away! or at least attempt to spin it on its head and give it a new playable style. Although they arent as plentiful as the first game so thats a start.\n-Some controls are really difficult to get used to, planning to use a controller? better read the tutorial for that as some bedtime reading!\nGraphics are really nothing special but the game does not handle darkness well. the reflective shininess of characters skin is quite distracting. (But makes sense when they are sweating).\n-Too much loot, a simple pile of suitcases can distract players from the immersion of missions.\n-Frame rate stuttering and freezing a some graphical issues faced when playing. ( I experienced it about 8 times through the story.)\n-"Boss battles are repetitive and have no impact on the story, only to introduce the next big mutated zombie..\n-Stamina Limitations are laughable and i needed to use a mod, A MOD to complete half of the story because of all the running and jumping. Modding community 1:Riptide Originality/innovation 0\n-Work Bench is so annoying! repairing weapons has never been so time consuming and expensive..\n-If you have lots of money that you have worked for ad you die, you will lose 30% of all of it! that might not seen like a lot but remember how often some people might die! I absolutely hate this mechanic in DI1 and now it continues into this game too. Punishment for exploring too much and dying? thank goodness dying light didn't have this Sinful mechanic!\n-The game will get stale quickly once you have tried everything/travelled there once. Not much is worth trying again just for fun/experiences. You wont go halfway across the map in most games just to watch a cliff watefall and sunset but you get my point.\n-Dialogue is very basic\n-Hardly any emotional parts or really epic battles/moments in the main story.\n-the zombie groans use like 4 different audio tracks!! (much like World at war...) so for long term players this is not good at all.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=442449551\nFinal Verdict:-Dead Island deserved a second Game, but Riptide doesn’t make the most of the "palette" presented to it. If you can get to it, there’s still the skeleton of a good game, but it’s covered by too much zombie flesh and discarded weapons.\nI rate this game a 5/10\nNOT recommended to new players, but fans of the original will gobble up this sub-standard zombie slasher. If you really are considering buying this, I have one piece of advice...get your mates to join. (Although long-term, dont bet on everlasting fun with that either.)","May 8","false","129.0"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","2"

Never got a chance to truly buy the game, only tried it. Got tried the Dead Island Riptide, but was not really interested, until the game went sale on steam...\n\nAn amazing co op zombie game. You like to play alone? Then you can go scavenge the city, or jungles, or beaches, for weapons, supplies , money, and gears. Let these zombies come crawling into you as you make your way into the urban village or the jungle, dealing one by one with the dead.\nYou wanna play with other people? Go ahead, gather up to other 3 players on the island where everyone except you and some survivors, are now dead, or becoming the undead.\n\nI love the weapons and how you can improve them. You can scavenge weapons in the wild, or get special weapon as quest reward. Plain weapons can be crafted, modified into any recipes you have found, turn them into better, stronger weapon to suit your playstyle. Melee styles can use blunt or blade weapons, then modify them with electric, fire or poisonous mod. You can also use assault rifles, handgun, and shotgun. You can also activate special skill, Fury, which can be unleashed to kill enemies faster and deadlier.\n\nWhat's more, you can one shot even tough zombies to the head, perhaps, so far, as I have found, not limited by their level. You can instakill downed zombies with some passive skills for certain characters. Each characters have their own specialty and certain set of skills, ranging from Combat to Survivality. One has blunt weapon specialty, blades, throw weapons, guns, hand to hand,etc. Oh, talking bout level. The zombies also grew stronger and their level will try to match yours, making the game more challenging.\n\nOther friendly players can also jump in into your game, help you out. You can also search the lobby for games with same/lower chapters and you can jump RIGHT INTO IT and  help em out. In the darkness of cave/facility, you can use your flashlight or your flares.\n\nThis game is great.

Combat and gameplay are pretty much the same, with the focus still on melee weapons, though guns and ammo are more widely available.\n\nThe hub defence missions are a nice addition, as are the "Dead Zones" that contain elite zombies and better loot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yukichigai/recommended/216250/","yukichigai","Y|yukichigai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yukichigai/","463 products in account","Dead Island: Riptide is one of the more fun zombie-killing experiences I've had in recent memory.  Building on the formula that made the first game such a hit, Riptide adds several new features and elements that make the second game feel a lot more refined and balanced, while retaining virtually all of the appeal and fun of the first game.\n\nIn fact, I'm pretty sure Riptide is an example of how a game company should handle gamer feedback when making a sequel.  Almost every change made between the first and second game addresses some common complaint from the first.  Health and consumable items no longer take up inventory slots, and won't unequip weapons accidentally.  Firearms are now FAR more useful against the undead, particularly if you follow the age-old advice of "aim for the head", but come in enough variety to be accessible early game.  Weapon Mod blueprints are no longer distributed seemingly at random, and certain weapon mods no longer make weapons so brokenly overpowered to the point of removing the game's challenge.  Basically, the entire system has been improved, dramatically.\n\nThe new additions to the game are also pretty nice.  The new character, John, is a rather fun, playing completely different than any of the other characters, but in a way that is not too hard to figure out (short version: punch everything to make yourself feel better).  Group Fury is also a surprisingly useful (and underrated) ability, which if timed right can literally allow you to bounce between Fury and Group Fury constantly without a break.  The new challenging "Dead Zone" areas are indeed challenging an sort of fun to track down, especially with a group.  And as far as the Siege events go, they too provide an interesting challenge that can be frantic and fun.\n\nDespite all those improvements though, Riptide feels less like a new game and more like an expansion pack.  It also feels smaller than the first, having only two large areas to the first game's three.  While there's more options for how you play, there's not much more to do when you play, though it's not as though that isn't fun.  The game also loses something of the first's ironic charm with the absence of any sort of high-class Resort area.  Aesthetically, part of the first game's appeal was that juxtaposition of idyllic tropical vistas with hordes of rotting undead.\n\nStill, the few problems with the game are a drop in the bucket.  The rest of it is all solidly fun, not to mention replayable.  The game does a great job of adding more good stuff while removing a good deal of the first game's bad stuff. I wouldn't go so far as to call it the clearly superior game, but it is definitely NOT worse than the first.\n\nIn short, if you liked Dead Island for more than just the scenery, you'll like Dead Island: Riptide.  It's just as good as the previous game, delivering more of the same with a variety of welcome additions and improvements.","May 1, 2014","true","101.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

I love it that I can import my DI character from the first game into riptide. Which is awesome!\n\nWhy I Like this game?\nGameplay  The gameplay got improved a lot. Sometimes I wonder if I'm playing the first game, or Riptide.\n\nCharacters  A new interesting character got added, I can't wait to play as him!\n\nNew weapons  They added a bunch of new interesting and awesome looking weapons, from blunt, bladed or range. It's all pretty new.\n\nNew skills  they added a bunch of new skills as well! Some are really helpful!\n\nzombies  New types of zombies! Which makes it even more fun!\n\nBeautiful environment  Playing on this island makes me wanna stay there for some odd reason...\n\nThese are so far my only positive points of view about this game. But everything has a downside, and so does this game.\n\nThe gameplay is a bit the same as the first game. Which isn't surprising of course. The game play is fantastic! Though I found it awesome if it changed a bit. So far? It's realy good actually!\n\nBeing level 50+ You can get one-shotted by a thrown knife. Which can be highly iritating.\n\nThe extra skins DLC won't be shown much. So it's more useful if you quite often play online.\nAnd yeah, that's about it.  I enjoy every second of the game. It's so much fun to explore, and with the new weapons you can have a lot of fun bashing their brains in! Or.. shoot them off? Cut them off?

While it's fun to kill zombies with weapons you construct the quests are repatitive and simple while somehow also being confusing.\n\nFor example, there is a quest where you have to attach an engine to a boat. First the game doesn't actually tell you to find a specific boat, so you wander around slowly with an engine. Then once you realize you need a certain boat it should be simple because there are boats everywhere but no, you need to attach it to a single, unique boat. Except in the map you are given a large radius covering many boats. So when you finally happen to get on the specific boat you see you can attach the engine to different areas. So I attached it to one side of the boat...and nothing happened. So I sat there picking up and putting down the engine. Then I got attacked by zombies and died. So, I respawned away from the boat and made my way back just to literally move the engine from one end of the boat to the other before I was prompted with the next aciton. Sound like fun???\n\nThere are good qualities to this game but there are so many tedious tasks, glitches, and unnecessary complexities that it detracdts from the experience.","August 2, 2014","false","7.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

It continues RIGHT where Dead Island left off, in a chopper above some sea/ocean/idk, didn't pay attention.\nObviously, Dead Island Riptide wouldn't be a Dead Island game without zombies.\nSo after the first few cutscenes which totally don't really add anything other than a few minutes to try and attract you to the game, you get control of your picked character.\n\nAs this is a direct continuation, you can import a character from the older game, but if it's already max levelled, then you gotta start a new one.\nDon't fret, because a new character starts already in level 15, presumably to show off that it actually still remembers something from Banoi.\n\nLocation? NOT BANOI. (rip mr. cinnamon lifeguard)\nIt's time for Palanai! There's a eponymous riptide on the islands, causing nearly everything to be flooded.\nBecause I have a fetish for water in video games, I've enjoyed this setting much, much more, because there was water EVERYWHERE where I wanted to go!\nThen you move to a city and ♥♥♥♥ goes down even more.\n\nThe zombie roster has been extended and there's some new ♥♥♥♥♥♥ zombies that don't show off any difficulty at all anyway™\nThe "difficulty" in this game has been increased artificially, compared to the original. Characters are MUCH more damaged by zombies, even a single Walker hit can cause you to lose 3 squares of health.\n\nMedkits have been made a common thing, so yeah.\nInventory has been worked on, and it seems it's better to use or sum ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThere's a few more weapons. Nothing really important, other than a staff that wrecks ♥♥♥♥™\n\nAnd then, we have that Completely Unbalanced New Character™ that is capable of dealing electric damage with his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fists. And throw ♥♥♥♥ away VERY FAR. John Morgan iirc.\n\nAnyway, let's sum this up:\n8/10, could use more work, but definitely an improvement over the older game.\nIf you liked the original, you will like this.\nIf you were skeptical about the original and didn't buy it, you MIGHT like this.\nIf you don't like zombies, or you don't think the series are worth your attention, 1% for you to like this.\n\nhave fun\n\n\nYes, I realise this game is pretty old to give a review, but I am really ♥♥♥♥ing bored while waiting for something to happen in my life.","July 15, 2014","true","35.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/216250/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","Any doubts you may have about this follow-up to one of my fav. games (Dead Island) should be quickly dispelled once you start playing the game.  Yes its basically more of the same, so if you loved playing the original and want a lovely large chunk of some more then you should get this game.  Just dont wait until a sale (like I did) and regret waiting.\n\nEssentially the game is very similar to Dead Island but with a few noticeable differences.  On the whole there isny much of a difference in the look & feel of gameplay.  Changes are subtle such as fast levelling, more streamlined story which provides faster travel between important locations, quicker access to quests and sidequests.  The addition of a new form of transport (boats) is quite cool when navigating the swamp areas, though running over zeds is the same as driving.  The new character (John) provides an additional style of combat (hand-to-hand) which is rather cool is not much different to the other modes of attack.  In addition there are new team based side-quests to help you level up faster on completion.\n\nHowever the real (noticeable) differences are the better designed map layouts and focused story chapters  which all meld to provide a greatly immersive interactive experience that never feels its dragging on.  Something which the original tended to do as you retraced your steps over and over again.  To cap these off there is a greater feeling of team interaction better the survivors and the group of NPCs that band together in their hope to escape the zombie apocalypse.  These essentially come to a dramatic conclusion at the end of each chapter as big combat sequences where everyone in group must fight of waves and waves of zeds in order to progress.\n\nDespite these positives if you didnt like DI's combat you wont find much has changed.  I loved the visceral feel of the original and as you may expect its the same here.  So if you didnt enjoy it in the original, you wont like it here.  The items and weapons at your disposal are just as lack-lustre as the original - there are no "super-juiced-up" items that you must get to complete the game, but at least firearms and ammo is available much, much more here.  So if you missed them in the original you can get to use them alot more here.  Crafting however makes up for the lack of these superweapons and though there were only a v. few new additions, the range of items that can be crafted is excellent.  Allowing you to customize everything to your style of gameplay.\n\nOne last suprise which I thought was a really nice step up were the boss areas that you had to go up against and fight to the death.  Nice variation in their abilities provide a good range of challenges against the normal grind against regular zombies.\n\nTo finish off Id recommend this game to anyone who loves mission-based action/fps/shooter/melee gameplay in a zombie apocalypse setting.  My only regret was not picking this up on release.  It may not be that much more than the original but, its definitely a brighter step forward.","January 3, 2014","true","89.1"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

The relaxing sounds of the ocean soothe my inner soul. I unfold my beach towel and lounge out on the sand. After a few moments of pure relaxation I come to the realization that I could be happily sitting in my DXR Racer gaming chair, feeling the hot air from the GPU fans tickling my leg hair.\n\nI immediately race to the car, leaving behind all that I know and love: my beach toys, my kids, and worst of all, my dog Fido. My wife chases after me yelling horrible things, accusing me of leaving the children behind. She tries to open the door, so I grab a crow bar and proceed to beat her in the cranium. As she falls to the ground, presumed dead, the children see me and start to make their way towards the car. I can't let them see what I've done! So I make a mad grab for my well worn 9 iron golf club from the back of my Fiat Panda 4x4 and whip around with surprising agility. I shout "Four!" and then, exercising flawless fundamentals, whack my daughter, Ezgi, in the stomach with my best driver swing. She crumples like a sack of potatoes. My two month old son, Copernicus, is so aghast by my well hefted swing that he bursts into tears, or perhaps he was hungry, either way the senseless bawling wore my nerves thin and I handed him off to a mother tiger shark who was getting whisked away in a shark-nado. With my family issue resolved, I could finally focus on accomplishing my obsession: to play Dead Island Riptide until the cows come home.\n\nI whistle for my dog, as he is my source of inspiration and true soul mate, he galloped to the car like a well bred bronco. I floor the gas pedal, running over two hookers and a group of orphans who were discussing politics in the beach parking lot. I run three red lights and by the time my car accelerates to 97 mph I hear blaring sirens as a squad of police officers move in on my position. Fido begins to panic and makes a leap of faith out the passenger window and is immediately met by the intimidating grill of a semi truck. I hear the cursing of an upset truck driver and the whimpers of my Fido, my only, deceased, true lover. None of this matters. All I can think of is having the warm, hard mass of my mouse in my heavenly clutches and my eyes gazing upon my large, girthy 23"  monitor.\n\nI finally reach home and know I dont have much time before the SWAT team kicks down my back door. I fumble with the button to turn on my PC. I slowly unbuckle my pants as the screen explodes with colorful gammas and lights of other dimensions, worlds I can't even dream of. I click steam and search through my large, vintage collection of pristine computer games. I locate Dead Island Riptide and click the ever enticing 'play' button. My ears begin to hear the enriching sounds of the beach. The gripping story fills my mind and entangles my heart. My eardrums are serenaded by the sensual sounds of the well casted voice actors and actresses. By this time I am fully naked,  and dripping with sweat, tears, blood, and seminal liquids. The graphics and realism far eclipses that of our own world and I feel myself getting transported to another, heavenly dimension. The soft purring of my GPU and six-core processor fills the room with romance.\n\nMy paradise is abruptly silenced as I hear the breach and clear of a very cohesive SWAT team. I am flashbanged and tear gassed. My senses are overloaded and I feel my eyeballs scorching. I begin to vomit profusely all over my Tt eSPORTS CHALLENGER Pro Gaming Keyboard and I lose control of my bowels. I feel the barrel of a gas-masked wearing SWAT captain's flat-top Colt M4 (14.5" barrel) with a Trijicon MiniAcog penetrate my ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  The cold steel is strangely arousing.\n\nWhen suddenly I feel a flick on my forehead and wake up in a cold sweat with my wife's stern face looking down on me. I grab my pillow and quickly dribble some drops of chloroform on it before shoving it in her face. She attempts a feable struggle as I pin her down on the bed. As she slips into unconciousness I check her pulse and find that it is becoming steadily weaker. I don't have time to tend to her. My PC calls me. I turn it on and hear the soft purring of the power supply as it provides steady energy in the form of electrical currents to my beloved custom built PC components. I stare at the clock and find it is only 4:30 in the afternoon. I have nowhere to be though, as I was fired from my job weeks ago. I prepare myself for a long, engrossing gaming session of Dead Island Riptide.\n\nI begin playing but find that my erection becomes limp. The drool dries up from the corner of my mouth and my smile morphs into a droopy frown. "This game blows donkey ♥♥♥♥!" I exclaim to my now deceased wife. Dead Island Riptide was nothing like I had dreamed. The let down was too much for my extreme emotions. I become so enraged that I break down my daughters door and begin to question her intensely. "Why does Dead Island Riptide suck so much ♥♥♥?!" I demand of her. She cries out "I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT DEAD ISLAND RIPTIDE IS!". My search for the answer was not over and I could see through her lies. I use the tactics I learned from my time in the CIA and kick her down, wrapping a Hello Kitty T-Shirt over her face as I begin to water board her with premium unleaded gasoline.\n\nAs she begins to drown, the voice of God calls down from the heavens and tells me what to do. He commands I uninstal Dead Island Riptide and write a gospel advising followers of the faith never to play Dead Island or it's preceeding mediocrity Dead Island Riptide. This review is that gospel. The word of the lord. Amen.","August 13, 2014","false","5.6"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","54","20","37","34","2"

Decent game in its own right, and when it works it's fine, but when it doesn't (which happens more often than not) it'll frustrate you to no end. Bugs like player desync, glitchy collision, and the game just closing itself out entirely can  and will happen quite frequently. Of course, these bugs are absolutely nothing compared to the one where your sound cuts out completely and you're reduced to one frame a second, as well as anyone else that happens to be in the game with you. I'd even go so far as to say it's more buggy than its predecessor.\n\nBut onto the game. To be honest, it's what Dead Island should have been in the first place. Guns are actually present way earlier than they were in the first game, and there are definitely a variety of different kinds of weapons to fight your way through the undead with. But through the games shoddy dialogue and dumb writing comes a mediocre Borderlands wannabe. Not very enjoyable in a solo run, more something to be played with friends.\n\nBuy it on sale.

Decent game in its own right, and when it works it's fine, but when it doesn't (which happens more often than not) it'll frustrate you to no end. Bugs like player desync, glitchy collision, and the game just closing itself out entirely can  and will happen quite frequently. Of course, these bugs are absolutely nothing compared to the one where your sound cuts out completely and you're reduced to one frame a second, as well as anyone else that happens to be in the game with you. I'd even go so far as to say it's more buggy than its predecessor.\n\nBut onto the game. To be honest, it's what Dead Island should have been in the first place. Guns are actually present way earlier than they were in the first game, and there are definitely a variety of different kinds of weapons to fight your way through the undead with. But through the games shoddy dialogue and dumb writing comes a mediocre Borderlands wannabe. Not very enjoyable in a solo run, more something to be played with friends.\n\nBuy it on sale.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaldraksprofile/recommended/216250/","kaldraksprofile","Kaldrak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaldraksprofile/","361 products in account","My recommendation is dependant on a couple of factors.\n\nFirst, did you like the original? If you did, then you'll probably enjoy this one. However, if you did like the original, don't expect this one to be nearly as good or as long. Just...don't.\n\nSecondly, do you like killing zombies, collecting loot, exploring, and most importantly, endless fetch quests? If you like the first three, and can tolerate the last one, then you'll probably enjoy this game.\n\n\nPros:\nZombie slaying, loot gathering, rpg leveling, skill acquiring goodness.\nIt's co-op!\nYou can get sniper rifles and own everything late game as Purna.\nYou can stomp on a zombie's head when it's on the ground! Y'know, if you've got the required skill from the skill tree.\nThere are new areas called 'dead zones' which are chock full of enemies and multicolored loots. Explore!\nOur four main survivors from the first game return...sadly, they still are unlikeable jerks for the most part.\nWeapon mods! Create custom weapons to rival the gods of fire or thunder.\nGore, lots and lots of it.\nSam B produces a new hit single! Yeah, I'm just as shocked as you are.\nDrivable boats!\nDrivable cars! Make those zombies roadkill.\nGun alternatives for Purna early game. First game needed this SO MUCH.\nA brand new immune named John joins the group. He has a sweet uppercut move.\nNew enemy types, including named boss type infected that are SUPER ANNOYING, but they're good fun to fight.\nThrowing knives that stack.\nRemoval of alcohol from the weapon wheel. Very helpful.\nImproved inventory organization. Grenades and other throwables no longer use up weapon inventory spaces. SO NICE.\n\n\nCons:\nSevere lack of fast travel locations. You know what this means? Length padding. Trek back and forth and back and forth and back and forth through areas you've been a million times before killing the same damn enemies over and over again because  it artificially lengthens a relatively short game.\nRepetitive. My goodness is it repetetive. Still fun, but it's best not to play in lengthy sessions.\nA brand new cast of completely disposable NPC's who order us around incessently and we consequently don't give a rats ♥♥♥♥ what happens to them.\nOne-shot kill glitch from cleaver throwing zombies. Do yourself a favor and download the mod that shuts that off.\nDead zones are basically copy/pasted from each other instead of making truly unique locations for each. I think I cleared the same basement in the city about 15 times.\nSignificant lack of human enemies. In the zombie apocalypse you have zombies, and '@ssholes with guns'. There are almost no humans to fight. Never thought I'd miss it, but a little more variety would be nice, y'know?\nHalf the length of the first game.\nStill no in-game ability to change the FOV settings. If you follow the online guides and like to shoot things, don't set FOV to 90 cause it causes your guns to go crazy if you aren't using iron sights. Set it 82.5. It worked for me.\nLoot settings are whacked. Apparently it's almost impossible to get the legendary items without modding the game due to drop restrictions.\nSevere overuse of running infected. Really lessens the impact of the running screaming ones if you throw them at me absolutely everywhere I go instead of saving them to jump me at unexpected moments like in the first game.\nAudio glitches abound. Female zombies sound like male zombies. Floaters roar like Thugs. Suiciders sometimes sound like Floaters. More extensive QA testing would've been very helpful.\nGot trapped by an NPC blocking a doorway once.\nGenerally weaker atmosphere, graphics, and overall presentation than the original.\nThat ending: Dear Techland, Learn how to write endings that aren't total sequel bait. Thank you.\n\n\nFinal verdict? 7/10\nIt's not as fun as the first one. It's shorter than the first one. Everything feels like a rehash of the original despite the new weapons and enemy types. The atmosphere is significantly weaker as well. In the original Dead Island, there was a palpable feeling of despair from the survivors. NPC's huddled in corners, some of them weeping, sometimes rocking back and forth hugging their knees, sometimes praying or comforting each other. The survivors feel and act like they are an inch from death and there was almost nowhere in the first game I truly felt safe.\n\nIn this one? Man, nobody cares much. It's like everyone knows they're in a sequel. Where's the horror? The panic? The pandemonium? First game has it in spades, but the second just doesn't. It just feels like the devs rushed it out the door. Every now and then I get a glimpse of the original through all this mediocre stuff they clogged the second game up with, but these occurances are few and far between.\n\nIf you wanna kill zombies, Riptide does a pretty good job of it. However, if you want a true zombie survival horror experience, go download the first game and go for a walk by the hotel in a dark room while you're wearing headphones. You'll see immediately what I'm talking about with the atmosphere.\n\nThis game is not bad or anything, it just suffers from that most dreadful of things, 'sequelitus'.","June 29, 2014","true","60.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Progression felt very fast through each chapter (especially multiplayer) and I found the Final boss fight to be higly disappointing and anti-climactic in Multiplayer, and just more daunting to accomplish in Singleplayer.\n- Gameplay itself felt really simple and reptitive, talk to this guy, do this quest, complete it, and return for your reward. Animations felt simple and reptitive, but still pretty fluid overall.\n- The game did have 13 chapters, but progression felt too quick and the game felt short overall, even if finish the game and return to do any side quests, It doesn't really feel the same anymore. You left the island and escaped, only to return for a few side quests and blueprints? Wat.\n- If you don't really don't know how to craft powerful weapons or find the right blueprints, the game is going to be pretty hard for you, whereas if you do know what you're doing, the game is fairly easy, regardless of level progression.\n- If you don't have a Dead Island 1 character, the game starts you at Level 15 by default and if you didn't choose a preset skill tree, which sorta makes you feel cheated out of the level system.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n- Realizing you lost all your money from dying because you neglected to use your medkits.\n- Fear my Legendary Liquid Fire Poisionous Stinky Lightning Shock Rod of Justice!\n- Leaving someone behind in a car or on a boat to get mauled by zombies.\n- Having to fight the same final boss 4 times in a row.\n- Realizing your melees are more effective than actual firearms.\n- Hearing zombies scream as you burn or shock them alive...er dead.\n- Realizing the "special infected/minibosses" are Left 4 Dead 2 or Killing Floor zombie ripoffs.\n- Getting mauled by zombies? Have an energy drink! Heals all wounds!\n\nFinal Review:\n\nOverall, after playing the game blind, I had a fun experience playing this game. Albeit a reptitive and linear, short game with a weird start for a sequel game, I still found it really fun to play, especially with other people. Think of Far Cry mixed with Dead Rising, that's the best way I could describe this game. If you haven't played the first game, I highly recommend you buy that first, then play this after, otherwise you wouldn't get the full experience. Still a really fun game to play as a first-timer, and I enjoyed it from start to end.\n\n6.5/10","December 9, 2015","true","21.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Aside from the whole new map and a new playable character, it's pretty much the same game with some new weapons, moves and zombie types. If you played the first Dead Island, you can import your character and it will come with the skills you previously owned. This game is shorter and easier, especially if you have your imported you save game. The base defense missions are the best bits of the game.\n\nI recommend Riptide if you think your experience with Dead Island wasn't enough already. If it's your first time going for Dead Island, stick with the first one: it's longer and has better quests.

If you're looking for a great and immense story this is not the game for you. The story plain out sucks, however the game makes up for it with mindless killing, blood and gore. I love the RPG element of this game especially the ability to upgrade and mod your weapons to add an extra punch to the zombies. The game has some flaws especially the attrocious jumping system (you don't use it much, but it can get annoying). Absolutely reccomend playing this co-op with at least 1 friend as it makes the game that much more fun.

The only new thing they added is one playable character which is pretty cool, traveling around with boat and some additions in character's skill tree so they can use more variaety of weapons. The character shadows and facial animations in cutscenes are bad as they were in Dead Island, no change whatsoever after 2 years of ''development''. Overall tho it's a great zombie game that I'm sure you will like, especially if you like open world exploring. The ending could be better in my opinion and the story line a bit bigger.

In many ways, DIR is a copy-and-paste of the original DI, with a list of subtle differences and a different island, NPCs, and quest line. One might say it is more of a stand-alone expansion, taking into consideration that you can transfer your DI character to DIR AND that it picks up right from where DI left off. And that is how I will treat this reveiw, by continuing from where my DI reveiw left off, covering the old and new aspects of DIR.\n\nI finished Dead Island in 25 hours, doing a select majority of sidequests. I finished Dead Island Riptide in 16 hours, doing a select majority of sidequests. With the release of DIR, none of the glitches from the first game were fixed, and seemingly more followed them as well. And because of the fact that this game was like a copy-and-paste of the original, this and all of the badly designed systems were transfered as well. The aspects that differed from the first game include:\n\nA few new perks on the skill tree.\nA new character to play as.\nA few new weapons.\nAn array of quests that differ from each other in almost no way at all.\nHarlow is hotter than Jin.\nYour character is half-mutant in the late game, but you only even get to experience it twice and for a very short moment.\nLess variety of guns.\nA few new crafting mods.\nOnly one firefight in the whole game.\nLots of wading through water, which makes you way slower.\nThe world is significantly small.\nThe new Dead Zone random missions (a good concept, actually, but they are all the same exact room with different loot and different exteriors, and so in the end a pretty aweful concept.\nPeriodic tower defense which is surprisingly not that bad of a concept.\nHarlow is a ♥♥♥♥♥.\nYou can do favors for your AI team to upgrade their skills or their shops.\n\nIn my opinion, lots of things made the game much worse than Dead Island, even with the few new concepts. I feel, however, that this game should be looked at the same as DI: terrible, glitchy, and a hell of alot of fun with friends. I will never again play through this game or DI, but neither do I regret playing it. On sale for about $5, I reccomend getting it, but only after playing through DI, or else there's no point in causing pain to yourself. Overall, I hate this ♥♥♥♥ing game, but it was one of the most memorable experiences in my life. So, get a few copies, kill some 'monsters', as the NPCs call them, and loot all the oleander your digestive system can handle. Oh, and the ending was ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.

It is probably created to play co-op with friends and have some fun. Playing alone can be a bit boring. Every character in game has skill tree and levels. Killing zombies and completing missions will increase your XP and levels. With levels you will be able to upgrade your character's skill tree. Map is really big and it has more cities. While playing you can find mods and with them you can craft your weapons. It is the second part from Dead Island franchise and it continues story from Dead Island 1. If we compare it with Dead Island 1, Dead Island Riptide has a lot of new improvements such as new vehicles, characters, skills, weapons, mods, zombies, styles of missions and more levels.\n\nGame is worth of money and i reccommend it to everyone who wanna have some fun with killing zombies and playing co-op with friends. If you want to know whole story you will need to buy also Dead Island 1.\n9,5/10","December 14, 2013","true","49.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

The weapons feel lack luster with nothing special about them. After you kill your first couple of zombies the combat mechanics get repetetive and boring even in co op. All that goes into it is spamming the e and left click button. Character customization is pahethic not adding anything to the game either. This is coming from a guy who didnt own or play the origional dead island. My thoughts are based solely on my experiences with this game. That being said I higly recommend you do not buy this game unless you are absolutely positive the repetetive mechanics won't drive you away.

Riptide starts out quite a bit ahead of the original by releasing with only the bare minimum of game breaking bugs but this is unfortunately also the only thing that Riptide really does better than it's original.\n\nYou start off the game being able to pick one of the four original characters, or in fact import you old Dead Island character if you so desire although all you really get is the levels. You can also pick the newly introduced "John" character who's specialty seems to be electric knuckles. After a quick tutorial, reintroducing you to the various concepts of the game you are then thrown onto the island of Palanai which is pretty much exactly the same as Banoi was in the original, a tropical paradise overrun by zombies.\n\nAs you start to move through the beaches, jungles, lagoons and cities of Palanai you will be hard pressed to tell that you are playing a new game and not just a reskin of the original. Everything looks and feels the same as it did the last time you played and there is very little new to be found. The scenery is still beautiful, the zombies still have no AI, the missions are still dull and the NPC's still make you want to hurt people.\n\nWhat little new is introduced is of little consequence to the overall feel of the game. A rather big portion of the quests are now "team" quests which are just fetch quests that the developers didn't bother to add any dialog to, essentially you run off and find specific crafting components which allows you to upgrade the weaponry/stores of the people that travel with you from camp to camp. Upgrading the weapons of these people tie into the new base defense type missions that will subject you to an increasingly strong horde trying to overrun your camp, the better weapons your team has the more efficient they are at fighting off the undead on their own, unfortunately it makes little difference in the end and you will most likely end up killing everything on your own regardless.\n\nBoats are also a new addition to the formula which are essentially cars that handle worse and that you can get pulled out if you fall asleep or forget to use the extremely forgiving quicktime event. A few new special zombies are introduced, such as the Screamer who's high pitched voice make you unable to defend yourself for several seconds, the Grenadier that throws explosives pieces of himself at you and the Wrestler who doesn't actually wrestle you but swings his one oversized arm around like a sledgehammer. A number of named "unique" zombies also populate the island, mostly in the new special dungeons called "Dead Zones" however these are just regular zombies that have been beefed up with more health or speed.\n\nAll in all Dead Island Riptide is nothing more than an overpriced standalone expansion pack that adds nothing of note that you didn't already see in the original and even for people new to the franchise I would still recommend playing the original instead of this as it provides much more content for the price.","May 11, 2013","false","196.1"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","0"

Riptide addresses a few of these failings but it's essentially more of the same. It starts badly with a clichéd corrupt corporate suit and a conspiracy; thankfully however it's not the plot that drives Dead Island but the exploration, loot and combat. For all its poor writing and characterisation the setting is still superbly realised, a sun-drenched tropical island with just enough variation in locales to keep it interesting. Combined with the great combat and looting and there's still a lot to recommend with Riptide.\n\nApart from fixing a few bugs and being more stable the most noticeable changes to the formula are the addition of new transport, a zombie horde mode which happens at key moments as the story progresses and a handful of new zombie threats.\n\nThe new mode of transport is a small boat (Think: Far Cry 2) It's a nice twist as towns and regions are now submerged and wading through water will slow you down. The boat allows you to quickly move around but its noise attracts fast water borne zombies called drowners. This new threat makes sure you don't really feel safe as they can clamber onto the boat and pull you off. It also addresses the problem in the original Dead Island of the invincibility of the vehicles.\n\nThere is also a new zombie horde mode although it only appears occasionally throughout the story. Each defensible area can be protected with barbed wire fences, heavy-MG turrets and booby traps such as electrical traps. Various NPCs will also take part in this horde defense and it requires a certain level of micro management, running around checking each NPC is handling him/herself and dealing with any threats they can't handle. They aren't particularly difficult and far too simplistic to really add anything to the game.\n\nThe new mutated zombies include wrestlers, grenadiers, drowners and screamers. Each new zombie poses a different threat. Whilst not a big change to the game play they do keep you on your toes, run into a screamer (think: The Siren from Killing Floor) at the wrong time and it can leave you defenseless which combined with other threats such as the infected can cause a few problems.\n\nEven though there's less variation than Dead Island there's still more than enough to keep you busy. Numerous fetch quests, loot and exploration will keep you busy for hours and the combat remains a satisfying experience as you chop of limbs and stamp on heads.\n\nI believe both Dead Island and Riptide are best played solo. Playing co-op is a completely different beast. Played solo Riptide is a tense game, one of fear and always looking over your shoulder. Played with friends it turns it into more of a fun fair, who can chop up the zombies faster than the other players with no tension and no sense of fear. So to best experience Dead Island I would recommend you skip the co-op and delve into what is still the best open-world zombie game available.","December 30, 2014","true","24.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game to me was "Icing on cake".  When it comes to harsh survival situations, resource management and fast paced hand-to-hand combat, this game ticks all boxes.  This game also involves personal strategies when it comes to kill Zombies/mutations: Do I attack the group of mobs head on? Or attack them from a distant with explosives and firearms. The storyline is interesting to say the least, when it comes to crazed tribe men to rich military ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, you can't help but have an envy to kill them and get off the god forsaken island.

Although some people choose to slag it off because it is literally a reskin. I personally believe this game is great. I put enough time into this game to reach level 50. There is alot of pros and many cons but this game is still great and really is a good edition to the zombie genre. The story is weak but gameplay is great and for that i will get straight to the point and list pros and cons.\n\nPros:\nGreat gameplay\nNice loot system\nDecent crafting mechanic\nGreat Replayabillity (If i spelt that correct)\nAwesome new weapons and mechanics which improve upon its last game\n\nCons\nBlank story\nSome plot holes\nPlain and sometimes dumb AI\n\nFinal verdict:\nDo buy this game. Its fun and simple to get used to. Dont let my cons put you off, The story really isn't bad but it does leave gaps. Enjoy!","March 5, 2015","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would still recommend playing the first, but the second was leagues above for me.\n\nPros\n- Better mods, better skills overall, and weapon proficiencies were added\n- Better story than the first\n- Moving about the island.  Not as static and boring as the first\n- Defense rounds are fun and challenging\n- New enemies\n- Upgrading of NPC team members and merchants\n\nCons\n- Some physics off.  Hiding behind a steel cart, guy swings horizontally and squashes me as if the cart didn't exist.  NPC trapped me in their hidey hole so I had to restart.  Ladders sometimes a little clunky.\n- Pretty predictable storyline.  Maybe zombie scripts are all played out?\n- Repeatable quests - why do they give so much xp?!  Bringing a can of food back should not trump main questline rewards.\n- Needs more fast travel points in the first half of the game.  Too much travel time v. quest/story.\n- Zombie ninja skills - this was weird.  So zombies throw weapons (a few did in the first one).  However, they are freakin' ninja assassins with these things.  One shotted at full health from a normal mob.  Zombies in water - physics don't apply to the undead didn't you know?  These guys run full sprint speed in waist deep water.  Lazy development - give us a reason they move just as fast in the water as they do on land.\n\nStill haven't played multiplayer with buddies, but looks like a blast.  Highly recommend.","January 23, 2015","true","31.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you liked Dead Island you'll like Riptide.\n\nTo me it seems like it's quite a bit harder than the first game was, what will make it sometimes kinda frustrating. But a good a thing is you can import your character from Dead Island so you don't have the sensation you're starting over at all. You won't have your inventory but the skills you worked so hard to get will be there!\n\nOverall it's not a bad game but could be a lot better. It definitely lacks innovation, something new to set it apart from its predecessor. It just feels like you're playing a Dead Island DLC or something. It's still worth playing though.\n\nI'd give it a 6,5/10 or so.","November 2, 2015","true","208.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

However, there are many bugs in this game. Not so many to make it unplayable, just to make it REALLY annoying. In one of the key missions you have to climb up a ladder and it wouldn't let me. It kept throwing me off halfway up. Had to restart. ZOMBIES GLITCH THROUGH ♥♥♥♥ING WALLS. WTF? PLAYERS CAN GLITCH THROUGH ♥♥♥♥ING WALLS! And little annoying af glitches like when you climb down a ladder you right leg freezes just kinda make me think it was a bit of a slap-dash game. With a bit more work, the plain ♥♥♥♥ing annoying glitches could've been removed and it would have become a much better game. It also would've been nice not to be locked out of the campaign when you complete it. We focused on the main story and when we completed it we couldn't use any of our weapons again or complete the side quests we left. But, if you're looking for a fun game and aren't too bothered by fairly tame glitches then sure this game is alot of fun :)","November 13, 2015","true","25.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you liked Dead Island you'll like Riptide.\n\nTo me it seems like it's quite a bit harder than the first game was, what will make it sometimes kinda frustrating. But a good a thing is you can import your character from Dead Island so you don't have the sensation you're starting over at all. You won't have your inventory but the skills you worked so hard to get will be there!\n\nOverall it's not a bad game but could be a lot better. It definitely lacks innovation, something new to set it apart from its predecessor. It just feels like you're playing a Dead Island DLC or something. It's still worth playing though.\n\nI'd give it a 6,5/10 or so.","November 2, 2015","true","208.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Let's just hope "Dead Island 2" has a better ending. Nevertheless, nothing beats killing zombies.

HERE YA GO!!!\n\nSure who didnt like Left for dead, this is diffrent, this is more open world, more throws you in there like youre really there, guess what that Led pipe you pulled off the building for a weapon, ya you crush enough heads in, and its gonna break unless you repair it. !\n\nThis game has a nice RPG feel to it, Mod Weapons, Craft, repair, Sell, etc...\n\nLevel up, put those points in Survival or maybe you think youre badass and go more Combat style, its all good and all fun!\n\nHeres some pro's and cons\n+great Co-op\n+RPG\n+Open World\n+love the crafting, and repair mechanic of wep's\n+Story, ok so the story isnt the best, but its still kinda cool, and doesnt just say here, heres a gun, kill the zombies!\nthere is a story to it, and you learn more as you progress and   help people\n+Graphics are decent for an older game\n+go for a blow to the head, arm, leg, take them out diffrent ways, with diffrent weapons, makes a diffrence, and its fun!\n+Love to pick between diffrent charaters and have diffrent abilities, but not a huge game changer, just a diffrent play style\n+It is better then the first one, I think... a lttle more polished, game doesnt crash on co op experiance\n\nCons\n-have had a few crashes on co-op, but has gotten much better\n-Open world is nice, but still somewhat go this way or that way.  Well alot of the zones, but for the most part its open world\n-found a few glitches with zombies getting stuck in a wall or two, not a big issues thou, 2 or 3 times i think so far\n-Driving a car seems very stiff, and dont leave your car far if you have items in the back, things tend to dispawn you go to far from them, but the nice thing, items reset too, so you are able to loot the same bodies or containers again...\n\nIn my oppion a good game to pick up and play with friends... Its been a while since i was on edge of my seat playing a game, and about jumped when was ambushed by  a zombie floating what seemed to be dead in the water when i went to loot something nearbye,   was awsome!\n\n","April 5, 2014","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found this game to be a slight bit more difficult than it's predecessor, Dead Island. But that is because of the new, more crowded environments and new enemies that beat you if you're not careful. With these new things, this game is, in my opinion, better than the first Dead Island. The map can be confusing at times, due to the amount of rivers and such. I had tons of fun playing through the story, and there's still many quests to complete afterwards.

In Ripitide I felt that the game lacked horror moments and places, and the feeling of not being safe in some places like sewer, prison, hospital.

Most of the reviews that are critical I wonder if they played the game as it is so much better than many of the new big ticket games out. This game does have new Zombie types! It is a polished piece of work with the best zombie physics engine going. rich textures, great sound, amazing detail (water that gets cloudy the deeper you look). A skill system that shows results immediately. Variable skill zombies, a weapon modification system, repeating quests and re-spawning zombies in public zones to always keep you on your toes.

There's simply just been too much saturation and too much cliche.\n\nWhat makes Dead Island Riptide so different?\n\nLets go back in time. The Original Dead Island was a game about a group of immune surivors who discover that throwing a weapon is far more effective at maintaining durability than actually using it as a weapon, than abusing it to the extreme. These survivors then go on to throw a sequel.\n\nFast forward to Dead Island Riptide, What has changed?\n\nThe answer is absolutely everything. In a sudden stroke of coincidental circumstance, suddenly throwing a weapon can magically make weapons disappear and the world comes crashing down on them. Desperate for a new strategy their saviour comes in the form of a foul mouthed Australian who demonstrates how we treat each other in Australia; bashing them because they're different.\n\nLed by the newfound Australian Bruce Lee they proceed to curbstomp every zombie from one side of the island to another, proving that once again Australian politeness is applicable to every race and culture.\n\nAs you can see Dead Island Riptide is not simply a zombie game. It is much deeper and broader than the zombie genre. Dead Island Riptide is an accurate and insightful game into Australian mannerisms, culture and traditions and will leaving you wondering 'Where the bloody hell are ya?'","September 2, 2014","true","20.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","2","3","3","0"

I can't put it into words but there's something wrong about this game. What Dead Island: Riptide should be in theory is just Dead Island 1 with a new setting and a new coat of paint. But for some reason unknown to me, it just feels BAD.\n\nThat's not to say it's a bad game, I'm sure others found it plenty fun, but in my mind, the enjoyment I had playing Dead Island just didn't carry over to this game. It feels very clunky, I have trouble walking from point A to point B. The quest dots that you followed in DI, which you became reliant on to determine what route to take and where to explore, just doesn't seem to work anymore. There's an option to turn it off and on, but really sometimes it works, and sometimes there's nothing. I often times miss attacks that SHOULD have connected, but didn't for some arbitrary reason, and that gives combat a layer of tedium that'll make you avoid any interaction with the zombies you can.\n\nIf you liked DI, sure, maybe you'll like this one. It is pretty much the same game. But to me, it's feels like... It feels like going to a restaurant you've been to before which you really liked, and eating your meal and not enjoying it like you did before.\n\nTL;DR - If you played Dead Island, you'd probably like this one, but something felt off in my playing of it. Buy it when it's on sale preferably, and skip the DLC. they don't really contribute much.","October 12, 2015","false","8.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I don't really recommend it to new players who did not play the first one, since it can get kind of hard and tedious at times, although for hardcore DI fans like me, they will like it very much. The first part of the game will be kind of boring although once you progress through the story and start getting better weapons and such, you will have such a blast blowing off zombie heads and cutting their limbs. As for the story it was pretty interesting although the final boss was not that great. The base defense missions were also pretty fun.\n\n8.5/10","May 14","true","30.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If the answer is "Yes," then prepare to be right at home w/ Dead Island: Riptide.  If you're expecting more than that - this is certainly not Dead Island 2, since the lack of new features and lack of improvements in some areas might certainly  disappoint you. Dead Island: Riptide offers up "more of the same", while having a few new things up its sleeve - which makes this feel more like an expansion pack, even though it is a stand-alone product.\n\nWhile travelling via cars, trucks, and other vehicles were available in the original, Riptide has a new addition: boats. Drowners, one of the new enemies in the game, can knock you overboard and drag you right out of the boat. You can even mount objects, quest items, and objects right onto the boat - and take them off of it if need be, as well. Boats play a major role in transportation in Dead Island: Riptide - and are a nice addition to the type of vehicles players can drive in Riptide.\n\nAnother heavy focus in Riptide is a new mission type: defense missions. Besides your typical assortment of ARPG quests [such as "fetch quests" (which littered the original Dead Island)], the areas that felt like hubs to get quests, talk to NPC's, modify equipment - well, now there are missions where the player also will have to defend these hubs. You can barricade areas, add mounted guns, etc - as hordes and waves of zombies come at you for a limited time and/or limited number of enemies. This new mission type is definitely a welcome addition to DI, as now gameplay feels a bit more varied with this mission-type - besides just doing typical ARPG quests. As you and your friends travel from "safe hub" to "safe hub" to try to survive and eventually hope to get off the island, these NPC's will even help you out during defense missions and fight along side of you.\n\nCombat, pretty much, remains the same as Dead Island - if it ain't broke, why fix it? Upgrading loot, getting new loot, learning skills - a lot of this is, pretty much, the same. If you loved Dead Island's system for tons of looting & its combat that allowed for slicing off body parts w/ blade and breaking body parts w/ blunt objects - you'll feel right at home here. It's still as addictive as it was before.\n\nNone of the new areas here in Riptide really even come close to touching Dead Island's first area of Hanoi, which was an excellent resort - and still is the series' best area (at least so far). While the new areas are well put together, no matter how you cut it - they still don't hold a candle to the resort in Hanoi from Dead Island 1.\n\nBy now, it's apparant that Dead Island series (at least so far) is not going to have the emotional, character-depth, and story-driven narrative that the original "backwards, slow-motion" trailer looked to be heavily hinted at. Just like the original Dead Island game - Riptide's writing, prose, dialogue, and voice-acting is nothing to certainly write home about. At times, the game tries to hit these notes, but it doesn't hit them enough to improve the series in that direction.\n\nIf you're here for a loot-crazy, zombie-smashing, upgrading-crazy & action-packed ARPG - then you've come to the right island. Riptide's island of Palanai might not be Hanoi; and Riptide, since it doesn't have a lot of major improvements, might not feel like a true-blue Dead Island 2 - but it still is an addictive + fun zombie-smashing ARPG that feels like a stand-alone expansion pack. And time-wise, this game's no slouch - after 22 hours, I still didn't even come close to doing every side-quest. In the end, Riptide delivered more Dead Island and felt like a very nice sized expansion pack - and that certainly is not a bad thing, by any means.\n\nFinal Grade = B-.","July 10, 2014","true","22.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The only thing they changed was the combat system and all they did was add levels for specific weapons and new weapons. The story sucks and is drawn out.The voice acting sucks. All the quests are pretty much "get me x and ill give you y". I'm pretty sure there's less quests in this game than the first. One thing that annoys me is how in the first game there's multiple groups of people in different places, so there are more side quests. In this one you just move from place to place with your group, so there's pretty much no side quests. The environment sucks in this game. The city is awful compared to the first one. Unless there's a story quest you don't run into bandits. The jungle is flooded with little boats so you have to walk extremely slow in the water. The game feels rushed consisting of a lot of bugs. They could have added so much to make the game good but they just made Dead Island 1.5.\n\n\nWhy you should wait for a massive price cut or avoid altogether:\n\n1. If you were severely disappointed by the first one and told yourself you'd only buy a sequel if they made improvements because the ones made (fire weapons actually give light in this game) are minimal and not a enough to warrant a purchase.\n\n2. Glitches abound\n\n3. The story defeats itself on many levels (it's also boring and confusing)\n\n4. There is zero improvement on the combat mechanics\n\n5. Zombies respawn even after rooms and spaces have been cleared\n\n6.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skillless/recommended/216250/","skillless","Peashooter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skillless/","238 products in account","I love this game, to a point where I've cleared everything from start to end, twice. However, I believe I am obliged to give this game a "no" even after my 40 or so hours of gaming with Dead Island: Riptide.\n\nDo not get me wrong. I had my share of fun with the game and this game is by all means an enjoyable experience. Even with the rather repetitive game play, the game offers quite a comprehensive story-line, leveling system and reasonably alluing graphics, However, there is one very fundamental shortcoming which most gamers will drag it below the passing mark: bugs.\n\nLet me begin elaborating by saying that the game offers an online gaming system where you can join another person's game half way, as long as they allow it. When I first started playing, I was with a friend and normally I join his game. The problem then comes: after every half an hour or so of gaming, I will either disconnect, or his game will hang. Hanging will mean that we will lose our progress AND the weapon which we have thrown out. A little note about the gameplay here: we normally throw our weapons (I play as Xian) as it wont deal much dammage to the blade and I can pretty much 1 hit kill a zombie (even thugs and screamers in late game) with a thrown blade weapon. It is very effective, though the tendency of my weapons going into oblivion is extremely high with an unstable game! So what happened is that, after the tunnel part, we went our own ways as we stay in our own games to avoid our weapons being sucked into the virtual black hole.\n\nAnother issue about weapons is that there are times when they will go into oblivion when you throw them. I have no idea why, but they just get bounced off an enemy without dealing any dammage and you can never find it again (I'm using blade, remember). I might be able to save the blade by quickly shutting down my game and starting it again, though that might not work at times.\n\nThe spawning is problematic too. Seriously, I've been spawned right in front of a screamer once, and died...\n\nThere are bugs about merchants and money as well. There's once when I repaired one of my blades, and then all of my 70k were gone. Poof, just right after one repair, and that repair cost 6k max. I was left with a pathetic 700+ dollars. Seriously ...\n\nThere was once when old quests came back to life. That canned food lady once asked me to look for stuffs in the beach when we were at the old cinema in Henderson... really ...\n\nAnd did I mention that no one ever joins the game. No, one, ever. You'll pretty much play alone if u don't have a friend. The community is dead.\n\nSo, yes, it's a great game, don't get me wrong. However, such failure in giving attention to details will earn the game nothing but a failing verdict. They have spent money on developing the game, so why not do some proper beta testing and debugging? You will love this game, but at the same time there will be times where you will be cursing the developers for not giving it a proper debugging. The "no" is not really for the game, but rather for the developers. Seriously, get rid of the bugs.","November 8, 2015","false","45.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Infuriating UI and consolitis.\n\nRiptide is almost the same experience but with some improvements. The biggest I can think of is that firearms now feel genuinely powerful against zombies, and are now a legitimate choice. The weapon category leveling allows you to enjoy all sorts of weapons no matter which character you choose to play.\n\nYou can import your DI character into Riptide and continue leveling it.\n\nThe locations in Riptide: The first half are pretty crap, the second half are pretty good.\nYou see all these screenshots of the characters in the swamp? You're going to HATE that swamp. You can't sprint, you just slosh around, and you're gonna be doing a lot of walking back and forth. Yes there are motor boats, and maybe you can drive one for ten seconds before zombies pull you out into the water in an impossible QTE.\n\nI still enjoyed this game plenty. It carries the positives AND the negatives of DI, with some improvements, not enough improvements sadly. But it's still DI, a bit better, and I love DI.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shauntmw/recommended/216250/","shauntmw","~Zero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shauntmw/","1728 products in account","I loved the first Dead Island game, but this... is... horrible.\n\nFirst of all, the one thing I hate the most is: This game gives me MOTION SICKNESS! I'm not sure why, maybe it's the framerate, maybe it's the swingy first-person camera whenever you do anything... Seriously, the character will move around when idle for too long, and FFS the camera swing along! The camera swings FOR EVERY SINGLE F-ing melee attack!\n\nI can't play for more than 2 hours per session. Gives me the headache.\n\nThe storyline is a sequel to the first game, and much similar to the first game, it's an open world melee zombie basher game with bunch of fetch quests.\n\nBut then, I gotta rant for some of the level designs.\n\nThe maps are huge, and the travel distance between the quest giver and the quest destination are often very far away, so there will be a whole lot of walking and climbing and jumping. Plus, the mini-map navigation line is broken, unlike the first game. You gotta be very near to the destination before the waypoint guide will appear.\n\nJungle swamp area are damn full of waterway that you can't run (you can only walk). A waste of time traveling between areas.\n\nTunnels are too damn dark you gotta keep using flares to light the whole room in red, which is super annoying especially when you activate your fury.\n\nCity areas are too complicated especially without a navigation guide. You can't plan your route with the map because often the map will not show blockage. Much like a real-world GPS.\n\nThe new enemy "Screamer" is a pain-in-the-♥♥♥.\n\nThe import character from first game feature makes the game harder instead of easier. It only imports your level and skills, but not equipments. So you'll start up with a high level character with no godlike weapons. The enemy scale with your level, so good luck with that.\n\nThe mouse sensitivity is not consistent. When set to my most comfortable acceleration for FPS, walking and melee attack is fine, but menu navigation is too fast, while aiming with guns are too slow. Bad console port.\n\nIf you're collecting achievements and perfecting games, all achievements are very doable, but the in-game achievement tracker is buggy as hell and some of the quest won't register itself especially if you're playing over the internet. So if you're unlucky, you might need to replay the whole game over and over again to find out which quest got glitched.\n\nLastly, a lot of plots make no sense.\nExample: Why do you have to burn the cinema films when you can just burn one of the sofa or the bundle of wood on the roof?\n\nVery bad game.\n\nMy score: 2/10","August 11, 2014","false","51.1"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","2"

Here's the game in general:\n\nPros-Fluid Combat System (This makes up most of the cons, honestly).\n-Very fun if played with friends.\n-Lots of Weapons to use. Lots of mods to try on your disposal.\n-You can choose which main character you want to play. Each with their own special abilities.\n-More Special Zombies from the first game.\n\nNeutral-RPG elements (A zombie game with leveling up system. Original but it feels weird)\n-Dated Graphics (It's not too bad, Character and Zombie Models look ok, only the Textures look bad)\n-Difficulty Spikes (Many people complained about this. It's not really a BIG problem. Most RPG games always have that)\n\nNeutral-Con-Boring Missions, Awesome Rewards\n-The Mini-Map will confuse you but the Big Map won't.\n\nCons-Horrible Options (Go and download Dead Island Riptide Helper, it will fix most graphical and control problems)\n-Buying items are better than Looting\n-Bad Animations during cutscenes\n-Lots of Loading screen\n-Boring if played alone\n-Story's too short\n-Buying stuff will be VERY EXPENSIVE if you reach the ending of the game.\n\nVerdictIt's basically the first Dead Island but with a different map. If you ever had a choice to buy either Dead Island. PICK THE FIRST DEAD ISLAND. This one's more boring.\nI still think it's a good CO-OP game. So buy 2 for a friend.\n\n6/10","September 7, 2014","true","20.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brumbek/recommended/216250/","brumbek","Brumbek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brumbek/","501 products in account","Riptide is a blend of the best ideas from Left4Dead, Dead Rising, Borderlands, and Far Cry. It is set on a beautiful tropical island full of zombie hordes. Now toss in character leveling, skill trees, randomized loot, countless melee weapons, an assortment of firearms, and deadly weapon modifications. It all creates a cohesive, high-quality experience not found anywhere else.\n\nIt is critical to understand Riptide is less of a sequel and more of a large expansion pack that delivers part two of the DI story. Being a glorified expansion, Riptide plays virtually identically to DI with a few noticeable improvements. Hence, Riptide is clearly not trying to win over new fans. Rather, it is meant for those who couldn't get enough of the original.\n\nAlong with a whole new island named Palanai to explore, Riptide provides a slightly more polished version of DI's core gameplay. There's also a tighter focus on the story and characters with new base defense segments. Guns in general have been greatly improved in Riptide and are now entirely viable. Riptide also features sniper rifles. Using a sniper rifle to expertly splatter a zombie's head like an exploding cantaloupe is as superbly epic as it sounds.\n\nRegarding the island topography, Riptide features beaches, swampy jungles, marinas, bunkers, villages, a big city, and various interiors. Riptide's world is expertly crafted with great attention to detail, always rewarding exploration. A lot of little lore touches help create a feeling of time and place for Palanai. There's also some welcome interface tweaks. The UI is generally classier, with better item comparisons and much improved tabbed inventory management.\n\nRiptide's character system is simply a slightly tweaked version of DI's. Some new skills and weapons add to the fun. A new character focused on Hand-to-Hand is added, Logan, who fits right in and offers some nice back story since he's a local inhabitant.\n\nRiptide features the same auto-scaling system from DI wherein all enemies and loot scale to your level. Also retained is the absolutely brilliant individual level scaling in co-op where a level 10 player can join a level 70 player and each player finds loot and fights enemies at their level.\n\nOn the downside, Riptide has the same technical issues and clunky movement from the first game. Fortunately, like the original, there is a free community Helper executable that fixes numerous issues, can change the FOV, can enable SMAA, and removes some annoyances. On the PC side, it is fairly easy to tweak your movement to make it feel as smooth as the best FPS games.\n\nMy biggest complaint is just how easy the game is overall. You get a boatload of weapons, components, guns, and ammo. Zombies are very rarely a challenge, and you rarely worry about weapon durability.\n\nUltimately, Riptide is all about brutally slaughtering zombies. Hacking, smashing, stabbing, electrocuting, burning, decapitating, and crushing are just some methods available. What makes Riptide worth playing is how incredibly responsive the game is to your killing choices. Wonderful spurting and crushing sound effects compliment wonderful visuals of skulls literally exploding. As solid as they are, the story, quests, and events are all just excuses to continue the killing!\n\nRiptide is a power fantasy game inviting you to make your bloody mark on Palanai Island. If you don't enjoy the slaughter I have to question your gamer credentials because this is the pinnacle of zombie murder mayhem.","December 28, 2013","true","45.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peanutbutterpretzel/recommended/216250/","peanutbutterpretzel","Dantastic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peanutbutterpretzel/","162 products in account","I can’t help but resent how much I enjoyed playing Dead Island Riptide.  Let’s get this out of the way; the game is rough.  Constant graphic problems, horrible bugs, lackluster story and voice acting, illogical gameplay, and some of the most infuriating glitches I have ever experienced are all contained within what is essentially a very long replica of the first game.  That said, as with the first Dead Island, I found myself completed immersed and enjoying the experience in spite of the constant problems.\n\nGame Play – a very, very conflicted 5\n\nPros:  The fighting mechanics are fun. In fact, they are the primary reason I enjoyed the game. The excessive slashing, stomping, kicking, and weapon throwing is addictive – exactly like it was in the first Dead Island.  Not only are the mechanics the same; the weapons selection and even the upgrade tree don’t seem to have been changed in the slightest.  There are a few new enemies, but for all practical purposes, it’s the same game, which could be a plus if you enjoyed the original.\n\nCons: However, the frustrating aspects of the first game haven’t been touched.  In fact, the original issues seem to have been compounded.  Thrown weapons still mysteriously disappear with infuriating regularity.  Spawning in the middle of an angry horde seems to happen far too often, and I even experienced completed missions would occasionally restart after a hours of game play later.  At one point 86% of the way through, I had one of the NPCs suddenly refuse to allow me to buy weapons, telling me I hadn’t completed the first mission of the game.  Even the steam integration is poor, regularly resetting my achievement counters on restart. According to my achievements I still haven’t reached 1000 head stomps, in spite of the fact that the in-game stats counter lists over 5000. The list of problems could go on, but this is my internal conflict.  The gameplay is both the salvation and downfall of the game.\n\nStory – 3\n\nEvery possible cliché is used, from the evil military, to the evil scientist, to the evil capitalist.  The few parts that are vaguely interesting are usually just recycled plot points from the first Dead Island.  To be fair, the side missions are generally more interesting than the main campaign, but that’s really not saying much.\n\nMood/Atmosphere – 7\n\nAside from the fighting mechanics, the other strength of the game is its stylistic flair. The Dead Island world is pretty and appealing, assuming you can actually get the graphics to run properly.  Which leads us to…\n\nGraphics – 6\n\nThe inefficient rendering led to constant visual glitches.  At first I thought it might be my slightly dated AMD card, but I’m not alone.  Nvidia and AMD users alike have dozens of support forums trying to troubleshoot the issues, and I found it tragically easier to just turn the settings down instead of trying to isolate whatever the nondescript issue might have been. Some of the issues, like the fact that fire didn’t render half the time, actually affected game play. That said, running around a pretty tropical island is always nice.\n\nAudio Design – 3\n\nRecycling the already repetitive soundtrack of the first Dead Island was lazy, but the fact that many sound effects were missing or just poorly designed was distracting.  Why don’t some items make sounds when dropped?  Why does my character obnoxiously talk out loud to herself during “stealth” missions?  *sigh*\n\nShould I play this?\n\nThere’s no way I could actually recommend this to anyone. But if you really enjoyed the first Dead Island, don’t mind the constant glitches, and can somehow get the graphics to work properly, maybe, just maybe, you might enjoy it like I did.","January 18, 2014","true","50.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Lemme give you gamer hunks some pros and cons and mehhhhs.  Just so you have an idea i played the whole game through by myself and might have a different opinion than some. :D\n\nPro : the flow of gameplay (smooth virtually no lag)\nintensity (i found myself with increased heart-rate when i had a few zombies chasing after me and i needed to climb up a ladder or rocks)\nweapons and construct-abilities (finding mods is fun)\nquests (the side quests in particular and sometimes long and seemingly pointless. but you level up faster making your gameplay late game quite interesting especially if you are looking out for mods... and more side quests)\n\nCon: some zombie fuctions and movements are.. sketchy.. to say the least (a zombie will run at me and i'll kick it and the one behind it will run right through at times.. a gohst zombie killer..)\nthe way to boat is, annoying to control especially when you have zombies hopping on (this could be do to me playing by myself.. idk though)\n\nMeh: the continous quest (atlest give me something to aim for, homie wants to pop pain pills i'm straight with that.. but he wants unlimited of them? i think 200 bottles sounds reasonable) i think i'm such a high level because i would travel around the map multiple times and collect all these thinks ang have 126 in my inventory and just level up like a fiend.\nkids online (i mean i'm fine with playing with people online.. but .. they ... arn't...)\nreplay value (lets be honest its not a game you are going to want to repeat the story mode in.. atleast its not as exciting as the first time playing. an addon or extention would be great to include with new contect and quests)\n\nThere is some more i could say but all-in-all its a great game. If i could give you some advice. don't die. you lose guap.. stacks on stacks of guap. i think if some features where added it could be a little more fun to play alone but i can't complain.\n\nHappy gaming love bugs","March 3, 2014","true","49.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Here's the game in general:\n\nPros-Fluid Combat System (This makes up most of the cons, honestly).\n-Very fun if played with friends.\n-Lots of Weapons to use. Lots of mods to try on your disposal.\n-You can choose which main character you want to play. Each with their own special abilities.\n-More Special Zombies from the first game.\n\nNeutral-RPG elements (A zombie game with leveling up system. Original but it feels weird)\n-Dated Graphics (It's not too bad, Character and Zombie Models look ok, only the Textures look bad)\n-Difficulty Spikes (Many people complained about this. It's not really a BIG problem. Most RPG games always have that)\n\nNeutral-Con-Boring Missions, Awesome Rewards\n-The Mini-Map will confuse you but the Big Map won't.\n\nCons-Horrible Options (Go and download Dead Island Riptide Helper, it will fix most graphical and control problems)\n-Buying items are better than Looting\n-Bad Animations during cutscenes\n-Lots of Loading screen\n-Boring if played alone\n-Story's too short\n-Buying stuff will be VERY EXPENSIVE if you reach the ending of the game.\n\nVerdictIt's basically the first Dead Island but with a different map. If you ever had a choice to buy either Dead Island. PICK THE FIRST DEAD ISLAND. This one's more boring.\nI still think it's a good CO-OP game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brumbek/recommended/216250/","brumbek","Brumbek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brumbek/","501 products in account","Riptide is a blend of the best ideas from Left4Dead, Dead Rising, Borderlands, and Far Cry. It is set on a beautiful tropical island full of zombie hordes. Now toss in character leveling, skill trees, randomized loot, countless melee weapons, an assortment of firearms, and deadly weapon modifications. It all creates a cohesive, high-quality experience not found anywhere else.\n\nIt is critical to understand Riptide is less of a sequel and more of a large expansion pack that delivers part two of the DI story. Being a glorified expansion, Riptide plays virtually identically to DI with a few noticeable improvements. Hence, Riptide is clearly not trying to win over new fans. Rather, it is meant for those who couldn't get enough of the original.\n\nAlong with a whole new island named Palanai to explore, Riptide provides a slightly more polished version of DI's core gameplay. There's also a tighter focus on the story and characters with new base defense segments. Guns in general have been greatly improved in Riptide and are now entirely viable. Riptide also features sniper rifles. Using a sniper rifle to expertly splatter a zombie's head like an exploding cantaloupe is as superbly epic as it sounds.\n\nRegarding the island topography, Riptide features beaches, swampy jungles, marinas, bunkers, villages, a big city, and various interiors. Riptide's world is expertly crafted with great attention to detail, always rewarding exploration. A lot of little lore touches help create a feeling of time and place for Palanai. There's also some welcome interface tweaks. The UI is generally classier, with better item comparisons and much improved tabbed inventory management.\n\nRiptide's character system is simply a slightly tweaked version of DI's. Some new skills and weapons add to the fun. A new character focused on Hand-to-Hand is added, Logan, who fits right in and offers some nice back story since he's a local inhabitant.\n\nRiptide features the same auto-scaling system from DI wherein all enemies and loot scale to your level. Also retained is the absolutely brilliant individual level scaling in co-op where a level 10 player can join a level 70 player and each player finds loot and fights enemies at their level.\n\nOn the downside, Riptide has the same technical issues and clunky movement from the first game. Fortunately, like the original, there is a free community Helper executable that fixes numerous issues, can change the FOV, can enable SMAA, and removes some annoyances. On the PC side, it is fairly easy to tweak your movement to make it feel as smooth as the best FPS games.\n\nMy biggest complaint is just how easy the game is overall. You get a boatload of weapons, components, guns, and ammo. Zombies are very rarely a challenge, and you rarely worry about weapon durability.\n\nUltimately, Riptide is all about brutally slaughtering zombies. Hacking, smashing, stabbing, electrocuting, burning, decapitating, and crushing are just some methods available. What makes Riptide worth playing is how incredibly responsive the game is to your killing choices. Wonderful spurting and crushing sound effects compliment wonderful visuals of skulls literally exploding. As solid as they are, the story, quests, and events are all just excuses to continue the killing!\n\nRiptide is a power fantasy game inviting you to make your bloody mark on Palanai Island. If you don't enjoy the slaughter I have to question your gamer credentials because this is the pinnacle of zombie murder mayhem.","December 28, 2013","true","45.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peanutbutterpretzel/recommended/216250/","peanutbutterpretzel","Dantastic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peanutbutterpretzel/","162 products in account","I can’t help but resent how much I enjoyed playing Dead Island Riptide.  Let’s get this out of the way; the game is rough.  Constant graphic problems, horrible bugs, lackluster story and voice acting, illogical gameplay, and some of the most infuriating glitches I have ever experienced are all contained within what is essentially a very long replica of the first game.  That said, as with the first Dead Island, I found myself completed immersed and enjoying the experience in spite of the constant problems.\n\nGame Play – a very, very conflicted 5\n\nPros:  The fighting mechanics are fun. In fact, they are the primary reason I enjoyed the game. The excessive slashing, stomping, kicking, and weapon throwing is addictive – exactly like it was in the first Dead Island.  Not only are the mechanics the same; the weapons selection and even the upgrade tree don’t seem to have been changed in the slightest.  There are a few new enemies, but for all practical purposes, it’s the same game, which could be a plus if you enjoyed the original.\n\nCons: However, the frustrating aspects of the first game haven’t been touched.  In fact, the original issues seem to have been compounded.  Thrown weapons still mysteriously disappear with infuriating regularity.  Spawning in the middle of an angry horde seems to happen far too often, and I even experienced completed missions would occasionally restart after a hours of game play later.  At one point 86% of the way through, I had one of the NPCs suddenly refuse to allow me to buy weapons, telling me I hadn’t completed the first mission of the game.  Even the steam integration is poor, regularly resetting my achievement counters on restart. According to my achievements I still haven’t reached 1000 head stomps, in spite of the fact that the in-game stats counter lists over 5000. The list of problems could go on, but this is my internal conflict.  The gameplay is both the salvation and downfall of the game.\n\nStory – 3\n\nEvery possible cliché is used, from the evil military, to the evil scientist, to the evil capitalist.  The few parts that are vaguely interesting are usually just recycled plot points from the first Dead Island.  To be fair, the side missions are generally more interesting than the main campaign, but that’s really not saying much.\n\nMood/Atmosphere – 7\n\nAside from the fighting mechanics, the other strength of the game is its stylistic flair. The Dead Island world is pretty and appealing, assuming you can actually get the graphics to run properly.  Which leads us to…\n\nGraphics – 6\n\nThe inefficient rendering led to constant visual glitches.  At first I thought it might be my slightly dated AMD card, but I’m not alone.  Nvidia and AMD users alike have dozens of support forums trying to troubleshoot the issues, and I found it tragically easier to just turn the settings down instead of trying to isolate whatever the nondescript issue might have been. Some of the issues, like the fact that fire didn’t render half the time, actually affected game play. That said, running around a pretty tropical island is always nice.\n\nAudio Design – 3\n\nRecycling the already repetitive soundtrack of the first Dead Island was lazy, but the fact that many sound effects were missing or just poorly designed was distracting.  Why don’t some items make sounds when dropped?  Why does my character obnoxiously talk out loud to herself during “stealth” missions?  *sigh*\n\nShould I play this?\n\nThere’s no way I could actually recommend this to anyone. But if you really enjoyed the first Dead Island, don’t mind the constant glitches, and can somehow get the graphics to work properly, maybe, just maybe, you might enjoy it like I did.","January 18, 2014","true","50.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Here's the game in general:\n\nPros-Fluid Combat System (This makes up most of the cons, honestly).\n-Very fun if played with friends.\n-Lots of Weapons to use. Lots of mods to try on your disposal.\n-You can choose which main character you want to play. Each with their own special abilities.\n-More Special Zombies from the first game.\n\nNeutral-RPG elements (A zombie game with leveling up system. Original but it feels weird)\n-Dated Graphics (It's not too bad, Character and Zombie Models look ok, only the Textures look bad)\n-Difficulty Spikes (Many people complained about this. It's not really a BIG problem. Most RPG games always have that)\n\nNeutral-Con-Boring Missions, Awesome Rewards\n-The Mini-Map will confuse you but the Big Map won't.\n\nCons-Horrible Options (Go and download Dead Island Riptide Helper, it will fix most graphical and control problems)\n-Buying items are better than Looting\n-Bad Animations during cutscenes\n-Lots of Loading screen\n-Boring if played alone\n-Story's too short\n-Buying stuff will be VERY EXPENSIVE if you reach the ending of the game.\n\nVerdictIt's basically the first Dead Island but with a different map.

I've only played in a two player co-op and I wouln't recommend this game for a single player run simply because multiplayer is so much fun.\n\nPros___\nCool fighting mechanics for close combat like stepping on fallen zombies heads and sending them flying with a kick. Interesting story, fine skill trees (different for each of 5 playable characters) and loads of stuff to do with around 80 side quests, sweet weapon creation and mod ideas, enjoyable "defend the base" actions and 4 kind of collectibles that give a better look at game's background story.\n\nCons___\nThe game has some minor bugs and few annoyances such as not marking the Dead Zones on the map which you have already finished (Dead Zones are a kind of mini instance, sometimes related to quests), inability to turn off auto-equip picked up items and inability to select weapons other then using scroll wheel (if I'm wrong on this one, please correct me in comments). On rare occasions, after dying I respawned far away from my co-op partner. Also some indicator of full rage meter would be quite useful - I used Fury only few times mostly because I kept forgeting it existed.\n\nSummary___\nOverall it is very solid zombie slashing co-op game that may serve around 25-30+ hours of gameplay - if zombie killing is what you like then this is a game I STRONGLY recommend.","September 20, 2014","true","35.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While selecting your characters, theres a menu that explains their abilities and skills better than the first Dead Island! After selecting your character, you have a small selection of build styles of some sort, for example you can choose to be built for combat which gives you a reasonable head start on some combat skills, or be built for survival which gives an early start for your loot and inventory and durability skills, etc.\n\nThere is better interaction and interacting menus than the first Dead Island in my opinion. Theres also friendly AI that actually aid you in combat and even have their own weapons and can fight for themselves! You get equiped with a fire arm really early at the near start of the game but don't keep it afterwards.\n\nOfcourse theres side quests and fetch quests which can be a pain sometimes (or all the time) but I find a couple enjoyable so far.\n\nThe only reason I got this game was to continue from the first Dead Island because I liked it. Sound is still good, graphics still okay but I'm playing at Ultra which looks really great.\n\nSo if still on sale and you want to try it go for it, you also got the refund thing if you don't like it, so good luck and have fun!","September 20, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However just like that game it is not a great game engine and does not perform too great. It has stutters and jerks but not constant stuttering so I was able to play through the game without major bother. The engine still sucks though and their newer engine they used for Dying Light is much, much better. This game also has many more small technical issues than DI1, such as sound glitches and general gameplay glitches.\n\nA step down from DI, stick with the original unless you loved it so much you have to have more, because this is the exact same game just with more glitches now.\n\n6.5/10","August 2, 2015","true","25.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In fact you can just import your character from the first game into Riptide and level it to 70 now.  There are some very minor changes to gameplay but nothing really notable.\n\nThere isn't as much content as in the first game in regards to quests and areas.  I played both games in entirety with only a single character.  In the first game I was able to waste about 100 hours doing everything; in Riptide it only took me 60 hours.\n\nI do suggest you play Riptide if you are interested at all in the simple story, as it is a true continuation picking up right where the first game leaves off.  If you played the original game just for zombie killing and the story means nothing to you then you will likely get nothing extra from this game.\n\nHighly enjoyable game, I recommend anyone who hasn't played Dead Island and Riptide pick them up and give them a try.  Dead Island 2 is right around the corner, and I can't wait for that too!","May 27, 2015","true","61.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It was a mess, it was riddled with bugs, so on and so forth, but it was fun and delightful and even challenging, at least as a new player. Playing DI:R honestly feels the same, but it still holds that fun, broken and enjoyable zombie head bashing rompiness feel that makes the game a great time. I've already noticed (at 1.7 hours gameplay) that Riptide is noticably more challenging, providing slightly tougher gameplay and harder hitting enemies and this alone helps the game rise from it's broken abyss. The atmosphere, at least in my opinion, is also a bit eerier which I love. It doesn't feel so much like a 'vacation gone wrong' like the first game and instead puts a darker feel on things and makes it spoopi- er, spookier.\nDefinitely play it with friends and have many a shenanigan.","May 5, 2015","true","26.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

It's still alright game especially if you can get it for cheap on a sale.\n\nI've now played 3 hours and I have almost zero sense of storyline. Every place has 10 times more zombies than in the first Dead Island game. After you kill the zombies you're safe in only a very limited zone as the zombies respawn very quickly after you move ahead a bit. Basicially this turns the game much more Hack 'n' Slash than the first one and this makes the storyline feel much thinner than in the first one. Also due to this Hack 'n' Slash system they've added a stupid achievement system that pops up on the screen about 10 times more frequently than in the first game.\n\nPerhaps I'll start liking it more down the road but right now I can't stand playing for much longer than 30mins at a time because there's too much combat as the zombies basicially keep coming all the time. If you wanna Hack 'n' Slash zombies, Left 4 Dead 2 is much better game for that.","January 9, 2015","false","10.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/recommended/216250/","snortcannon","Snort Cannon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/","1320 products in account","Dead Island Riptide is the sequel to Dead Island. But will you want to play it ?\n\nDead Island Riptide pickups as soon as Dead Island ends. We are transported on a boat where the scientist want to do the experiments on the immune survivors to find a cure for the zombie virus. But it turns out the boat is full of the undead and it crashes on the island of Palanai and it's up to you to find a way off the island.\n\nGameplay wise the game is the same as the previous title. The game is a hack and slash RPG where you can loot chests for better weapons and find blueprints to craft even better items. There's also guns but you really want to use melee weapons as the fire power is pretty much useless.\n\nGraphics are identical to the first game as well. There are minor changes like the better water effects and a few texture upgrades. There's also this funny effect where the weather changes instantly and it looks horrible.\n\nAudio in this game is beyond horrible. The soundtrack is alright for the most part, but everything else is just awful. Many times the audio would cut out and wouldn't return unless I rebooted the game. There's a lot of horrible sound effects like zombie puking noises and some of the weapon sounds which are terrible.\n\nThe game is pretty difficult. I played with three people from start to finish and the game scaled the enemy level to the highest player in the lobby which is really awful. Some zombies do more damage than others and the difficulty comes in the bullet sponge bosses, who move too slow and take up too much damage.\n\nLevel Design is a mess to say the least. The first game wasn't a problem to navigate around, but this just takes it to a whole new level. The map doesn't even look like the game layout making some of the travels to the objectives or secret bosses a pain in the ♥♥♥. It took some time to find what were looking for just because the map design is horrible.\n\nGame is really long. It took me 15 hours to finish the entire game and finish all side quests and all of the dead zones. There's not much replay value unless you want try playing with the different characters, but overall there's not much replay value here.\n\nThe game is a buggy mess. The sound bugs was one thing, but there are a few problems I would love to point out. The game has physics problems. I once had to jump over an obstacle, but the game flew me into the air instead. Some of the dead zone bosses appeared after we already killed them, just to name a few bugs.\n\nDead Island Riptide is a very poor sequel. It's boring, the story is awful, a lot of bugs, connection problems with co-op. I really wanted to like this game, but in the end all I can say are bad things. Only check this game out on sale, don't even bother at full price or check out the first Dead Island which was in general a better game. I give Dead Island Riptide a 4.5/10","August 10, 2015","false","17.1"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","15","30","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UmbraDragon/recommended/216250/","UmbraDragon","Umbra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UmbraDragon/","426 products in account","Quick Review\n\nDead Island: Riptide comes across as just another means of cashing in on the Dead Island franchise with very little effort in designing new weapons, areas, enemies, and characters. While it is true that Riptide feels like a stand alone expansion to its predecessor, it accomplishes so much more.\n\nMore workbenches allow for less backtracking. You are able to repair, upgrade, and mod your weapons more often thanks to the larger abundance of workbenches within the game world. The starting level is increased to 15 to allow for players to jump right into the game, becoming zombie killing machines right off the bat.\n\nStorywise, Riptide doesn't really accomplish anything special or memorable, but it does deliver a much better performance than the first. The story focuses more on the survivors of the first game, giving them an actual story rather than just leaving them as blank slates. This helps to create a smooth often laughable B Zombie narrative.\n\nThe combat hasn't changed much from the first, but thanks to the starting level increase, it makes the game feel more consistent. The first Dead Island didn't understand if it wanted to be a survival or action game, where as Riptide is an action zombie massacre game through and through.\n\nOverall, Riptide is actually a pretty damn good zombie game. Highly reccommended if you're looking for a zombie game or just a nice co-op game. 8/10","March 29, 2015","true","22.0"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

But I got DI along with the Riptide pre-purchase iirc.\n\nI'm just going to keep it simple, the game is OK at best. The highlights are the nice environments you can explore and fight in. The killing zombies part, which while incredibly repetitive (to be expected), is fun. The variety of weapons you can use to chop and blast them is great.\n\nThe bad points are similair to the first game Dead Island. Cheesy dialogue and poor storyline make it uninteresting and tedious at times to play through. You can just run around like a lunatic and hack and slash away with no real consequence. Dying to a zombie isn't punishing.\n\nI must say, in general, DI: Riptide is superior to Dead Island, so if you want to play this game, stick to Riptide. Don't expect much out of this game though, other than running around killing things in paradise, it doesn't offer too much. IIRC the zombies might be a bit harder than the one's in Dead Island.

But I got DI along with the Riptide pre-purchase iirc.\n\nI'm just going to keep it simple, the game is OK at best. The highlights are the nice environments you can explore and fight in. The killing zombies part, which while incredibly repetitive (to be expected), is fun. The variety of weapons you can use to chop and blast them is great.\n\nThe bad points are similair to the first game Dead Island. Cheesy dialogue and poor storyline make it uninteresting and tedious at times to play through. You can just run around like a lunatic and hack and slash away with no real consequence. Dying to a zombie isn't punishing.\n\nI must say, in general, DI: Riptide is superior to Dead Island, so if you want to play this game, stick to Riptide. Don't expect much out of this game though, other than running around killing things in paradise, it doesn't offer too much. IIRC the zombies might be a bit harder than the one's in Dead Island. However I still wouldn't recommend the game, 5/10 at best.","March 18","false","81.1"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

The devs thought they knew how to design a fully effed-up automatic save system, yeah they are right.\n\nThere is no way to save your game progress if you decided to stop between check points, mybe you are tired, or maybe you need to go to work, etc. You will lose some minor progress if you force quit, maybe some mod materials or cash, usually it's no big deal.\n\nHowever if the game crashed, like in my scenario: I thrown my weapons to take out a Floater, then picked the weapons up, then the game CTD'ed. I restart the game, not just I've been kicked back 1000 miles away (since the devs decided check points should be 1000 miles apart), all the thrown and retrieved weapons are gone! All gone! Among them is my best orange weapon. I'm totally bummed and lost my interest to play on.\n\nThere is no way to load an older save so that I can at least get back my orange weapon. In fact, there is no older saves at all, the game keeps one and only one save slot for one character, and the bl00dy auto save just overwritten all my hope of getting back my best and most powerful weapon. Good job, stupid game developers.\n\nIf Dead Island 2 also "features" such stupid save system, I'll just skip it.","May 29","false","53.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Again The Biggest down side to Dead Island is the weapon leveling system they had in place. I knew it in the first Dead Island and Now in Riptide that It was going to be Awful and I was right once again. Cause once you found a Great Gun, the gun needed level ten to use and you where that level you are happy as can be for awhile. Until you find the next hand gun that was better and needed a higher level to use which would drive anyone crazy. At that point you are endless grinding level to use that weapon or any weapon in the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rheostat/recommended/216250/","rheostat","bfRheostat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rheostat/","940 products in account","Somewhat recommended. I can't say that game is really good. TL;DR: Some bugs and goofs, mediocre story, average quests. Please note this game has extreme blood and gore and there isn't any option/mod to turn this off.\n\nThe game continues from first Dead Island and there is plot summary about what happened before. There is a new place and a new extra character.\n\nSince i didn't play the first one, i can't compare. As i see, Dead Island inspired from many games. As island concept and vehicles, reminded me Far Cry 2 and 3. Crafting something reminded me Dead Rising 2 but you have to find/buy blueprints instead of unlocking combo cards. Repairing something for money is so silly but it's a game in the end. Chrome Engine 5 is weird, its between current-gen and old style graphics. Especially blood-stain effect on weapons and raindrop effect made me feel like i'm playing a game from 2003. I can't say Techland didn't put an effort to develop DI as good as possible but something isn't right as well. If i can see that dullness, i'll edit this recommendation.\n\n\nLet's take a look for pros and cons:\n+ Open world\n+ Crafting\n+ Seems boring but somehow it make you keep it play\n\n- Vehicles are generally useless\n- Quickly respawning zombies\n- Some weird bugs (i.e. sometimes you stuck somewhere in the water and can be drowned)\n- Silly underwater and getting-wet-by-waterfall screen effects\n- Looting is painful and after a while getting boring\n- Inventory menu could be more useful\n- (imho) Too much blood and gore and it can't be turned off\n\nIf you want to try this one, i can recommend to wait for a great discount. Not worth for the full price.","December 8, 2013","true","23.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

Somehow they managed to make Riptide even more buggier and unbalanced. Finding good weapons is easy considering most of them seem to respawn instantly within 2 seconds of picking it up, meaning you can fill your inventory with a handful of katanas with varying damage and just pick the best one and sell the rest. This of course leads to having endless piles of money as well which you can again use to purchase the most rarest weapons just like that. This instantly ruins the fun for me considering theres real no sense of discovery for good weapons, or challenge when it comes to killing zombies. And as if having superior weapons and ridiculous abilities like insta-kill stomping isnt enough, your Rage abilities can take care of a horde in an instant with no effort what so ever.\n\nSo if the gameplay itself is so boring for the reasons mentioned above, maybe the story or quests have something to offer? Well, as you should know from playing the original Dead Island, the overall story and cutscenes are more embarrassing to watch than anything else. What comes to the side quests, its pretty much "Can you bring me my astma inhaler" and then you run around the city killing the same bunch of zombies and collecting the same respawned weapons you picked up last time.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about this game, is that chopping off limbs from the zombies one by one is pretty satisfying and fun to do in the beginning, but since its so easy to kill the zombies in a single hit after a few level ups this doesnt carry the game very far... The only reason I played it for this many hours is because a friend of mine felt like he needed to complete the game to get something for the money spent on it, and he didnt want to play it alone (even punching yourself in the face is more fun if a friend is there watching).\n\nSo all in all, if you want challenge and/or good story, this game isnt for you. Wouldnt recommend.","July 12, 2014","false","19.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The main part of the area is that the place is covered in water which forces you to us boats which are the most horrible thing to control. The other problem with the area is that not a single part of it is interesting, it lacked character.\n\nYet another problem I had with the game is that the combat in the game is the dullest most boring thing ever. Every time you try to hit an enemy it uses stamina which make the combat a mixture trying to hit and walk away.\n\nOverall I definitely recommend you stay away from this game completely\n\n","July 28, 2014","false","12.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A Dead Island sequel that could have easily been just a DLC or labelled as an expansion pack. Money-wise I purchased it for a relatively cheap price so I have no issues with this. It's just that the game does not really offer anything new. There are some cool new weapons, some new monsters and the 4-member team now gets a 5th member.\n\nThe story takes place immediately after the 1st game as our protagonists get apprehended by the military. Their ship gets attacked by zombies (I guess someone gets infected and all hell breaks loose) so during the first level you need to escape the ship. Our survivors then find themselves on Palanai - another island that got the virus so now we are back in action for a 2nd time.\n\nSome cool new things you have in the "sequel":\n\n-weather system that changes in accordance with the action: as the combat becomes more intense so does the weather\n-we now have rowboats: this is an interesting addition as along with this a new zombie type has been introduced that can actually survive in the water and cannot drown\n-coop gameplay is much better: I did not experience any disconnections (played the game on its release date) and when playing with someone there's a new auto-balancing system instead of the limitations in the first game\n-we can import our characters from the previous game as they are in the sequel with basically the same skill tree: they can start at level 15 now\n-there are some new weapons such as the various grenade types and we also have sniper rifle and rocket launcher at our disposal\n-there are sequences where the aim is to protect an area while the zombie are swarming at you - you can put up fences and place mines - these parts are really cool and are for the coop experience\n\nOverall, Riptide is a good game. There are some cool new feature and many of the bugs / glitches of the original game were corrected. Also, it should be noted that Techland's Chrome 5 engine runs superbly and graphically the game can be beautiful at times. It's not a Crysis 2 but it gets its job done properly.\n\nI recommend this game to the fans of the original only and I believe its Steam pricing is a bit high so perhaps you should pick this one up when it's on sale.","February 7, 2014","true","59.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Buuuttt I must say, this wasn't as good as the first. This was really short, about 12-13 hrs more or less. A lot more apparent glitches and bugs in this one, making me feel like they rushed this. One good thing is the build up on the story. Soooo ya....it's pretty mehh... :/  You can ride a boat...I guess that's a thing...you can carry over your leveled characters from the first game...you can do an attack from above now...yaaaa... can't wait for the next game though, there's a good set up at the end :P","November 5, 2013","true","12.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

I mean sure the frist game was more "orginal" even though it copyed diblo and borderlands so much its sad. This game is also more of a expinson pack of the first game Judging by its low price even on the day it came out,I wont feel bad looking at it as such.)\n\nThat being said for a zombie game it has good combat so maybe its worth a look.\n\nWell first off is the story,its........bad......like funny bad.\n\nThe main threat for the whole game *other then zombies* is a nuke,I mean really? A nuke is the most boring thing you could have as a stupid ticking clock.\n\nThe funny thing is the nuke is litraly pointless and the game has a compleatly fine clicking clock plot devise.\n\nThe main charctaers you are playing as are all imune to becoming zombies,that being said it seems your imunity is wareing off and you might become something worse then a zombie if it goes though.\n\nThis goes somewhere and could of been used instead of the nuke,but then again you do not play zombie game for the stroy you play it for the gameplay.\n\n\nSo the gameplay,for a zombie game its fast paced,its not like resdent evil and zombie U,this game never trys to scare you and thats why resdent evil and zombie U are better games.\nAnd unlike a game like dayz this game does not try to do anything that is not killing zombies *other then really bad human fights*.\nSo this game is in the same league of resdient evil 6 and dead rissing as far as fast pace large scail zombie killing games go,but this is not as good as resident evil 6 so take that how you will.\n\nBut dont get fooled this game is not a rpg,sure there is like a few perks that change how good you are most are just really small or so over powerd its funny,it unlocks some excusive things like backpack space,attack moves,or being able to pick locks on really good loot creats * there is no lockpicking mini game though*.\n\nThe gameplay is normaly just spam the zombies with what ever wepon you have untill they die *helps if you aim for the head.\nUnless you have a gun how ever,then you have to take aim with super weak fire arms or nailguns and try to spare the really rare bullets,that is untill you reach the final act.\n\nBy the end of the game bullets go from way to rare to every street corner.\n\nSo ammo is never really a thing to tell the truth its ether a tasty treat thats not even that good or the only worth while option.\n\nThe thing is though dont think this makes hand to hand op,because your baseball bats,swords and hammers will all break within a few zombie kills,sure you can repair them but its so simple to do so its really just there to make you switch out your wepon.\n\nThe game is also buggy as all hell and if you are even thinking of playing this game with friends *the best way to play* then be ready for a headaich becase it makes you go though hell to get online,I managed to get online but we desinked the minute we made eye contact.\n\nThe ending also sucks even more then the ending for the first game,I mean really the ending would probly of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off if it was not the most funny thing I saw the whole day.\n\nSo if you liked dead isalnd one then this is more of that but better so really I dont think this game is the worst thing ever like some say,I mean I had fun with it,Its not awfull but its not for people who like to think when they play video games.\n\nIf you can get it for 10 bucks or less pick it up but if you do get it make sure to turn your brain off when playing it,or just let a zombie eat it.","May 13, 2014","false","33.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Another reviewer compared it to DLC, and this is basically true.  It plays out like a side quest (albeit a long one) from the first game.  The new character, John, plays a good bit like Sam B.  You're able to import an existing character from the first game, and new characters begin at level 15.  Beware of playing at low detail levels, as I did, because you won't be able to see environmental hazards like fire AT ALL.  While this has a bit more polish than an indie game, it certainly doesn't feel like a AAA title.

Another reviewer compared it to DLC, and this is basically true.  It plays out like a side quest (albeit a long one) from the first game.  The new character, John, plays a good bit like Sam B.  You're able to import an existing character from the first game, and new characters begin at level 15.  Beware of playing at low detail levels, as I did, because you won't be able to see environmental hazards like fire AT ALL.  While this has a bit more polish than an indie game, it certainly doesn't feel like a AAA title.  I'd give it a 6/10.","April 16, 2015","false","98.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Is this a good game?  No.  It isn't a good game.  It's a terrible game, with poor controls, crappy weapons that hurt you more than they hurt who you are fighting, and an abysmal ending.\n\nFans of the first game may fine some level of enjoyment in this, but the only real enjoyment I had was playing co-op with friends.  Be warned, if you even think of modding your weapons to apply fire, poison, or shock, your friends will get mad at you as they take damage from your attacks.  By the end, I gave up on most melee weapons and just used guns almost full time.\n\nIf you find this on sale, great, you might have fun.

For something of a triple-A title, you'd think gameplay would be less generic.\n-It's full of bland, unoriginal characters.\n-None of the gameplay is any different than Dead Island (save for a few quality of life improvements, like removing one of the head-stomp animations.)\n-You'll be running around a lot, so expect having to mod in a stamina extender.\n\nAt best, this game should have been a $10 DLC for Dead Island.

I forgot about it until a few days ago, I bought it and played it through. At the age of 18, this game managed to make me jump once or twice with it's plathora of enemies you have to fight. The game went really well with a podcast and now it's left me craving for some more dead island. The story continues from dead island the original, so I suggest playing that before you play this. If not, then go on google and find out the general gist of the original game before playing this one.\n\nIt's a beautiful game and I cannot wait for dead island 2, cheers for reading.","June 30, 2014","true","29.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The exploration factor is somehwat diminished, since you have allies that can watch your back and maintain bases for you.\n\nOther than that, it's a worthy successor and has all the main features of the original. I highly recomend it, even though it probably isn't as good as the original Dead Island. If you've played Dead Island 3 times like I have, you're probably bored of it and will like something new, and you'll find it in Riptide.","May 29, 2014","true","37.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is like a giant DLC for the original Dead island.  Many recycled Zombies, animations, weapons, textures, items, ect ect.  It is a continuation of the story and fewer bugs than the original.  While the game is shorter than the original, the amount of time to beat it is about the same if you include side quests.\n\nHowever the original is a lot bigger in terms of areas, places to see, and textures.  I still love the melee combat and smashing zombies is good fun.\n\nThe gun play is ok, but there is almost no people to shoot back at you with the exception of a few rare areas.  This game also feels much more easy.\n\nAnyway - cool gameplay, fun melee, boring guns, and loads of zombies.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serendone/recommended/216250/","serendone","Serendone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serendone/","675 products in account","Atmospheric, gorgeous, and intense, though not without the quirk or two, Dead Island Riptide does what the first game did very well, but better, while optimizing and streamlining the overall game experience.\n\nPlotwise, DIR Doesn't really do much outside of your typical "Escape the zombies and find out all this conspiracy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t" tropes. The game prefers to tell stories through the environments you visit and the people you help out. The island of Panai is less "touristy" than the first game, which lends its areas a sense of ruggedness and hostility. Whether you're winding through the claustrophobic streets of Henington (?) or wading through the monsoons in the jungle, DIR presents you with some of the most gorgeous visuals this generation and the right balance of horror and terror. Environments are well-detailed, with tons of places to explore and nooks and crannies to turn over. It's just a shame the characters don't share the same level of care, with most of them looking uncanny valley-worthy, if not downright hideous.\n\nCombat, another Dead Island staple, has been improved and better fleshed out than in the first game. The  RPG elements have been refined, with a few new skills and the ability to further refine and individualize your character with weapon skill levels. Use a lot of blades and you'll get better with them. Shoot a lot of enemies and your firearms skill will increase. It's much deeper than the hollow RPG elements in the original game, which were limited to XP and perks.\n\nEnemy AI is considerably better, although you fight considerably less human enemies this time around. Shooting is vastly improved to the point where it's actually fun and preferable to kill with bullets as opposed to blades. No longer will you feel bad for rolling as the firearms expert, although there's still no reason to play with the unarmed or throwing skills. Areas scattered around the game called "Dead Zones" offer challenging nests of monsters to clean out for sweet loot. Additionally hub defense missions are just the right amount of frantic, although your allies could do a better job taking out the zombies.\n\nDIR plays with fear just as well as the first game. Even as a seasoned veteran of its predecessor, DIR still manages to move you with equal parts horror and terror. Infected sprint at you and make your trek accross the island much scarier if you intend to traverse without combat, and slow-shambling zombies crowd you and stop at nothing to sink their teeth into you. The special infected are back, from Rams to Floaters to Suiciders, accompanied by the Wrestler and Screamer, among others. They are welcome additions to the cast of hostiles, though they tend to show up way too often in the game's closing chapters.\n\nSpeaking of which, the game's pacing in general just feels weird. You'll most likely forget *why* you're doing the things you do, and your accomplices will relocate from base to base in a giant pilgrimage. It's a nice feeling, but like the first game you don't seem to care about the one-dimensional protagonists and the plot starts to fall apart. The game's closure is rather unsatisfying, to top it all off. Thankfully, the story isn't a major player in this game, and I'm glad Techland chose to fix up the game than try to provide a stellar plot. Obscure bugs and glitches still happen, but they're cosmetic for the most part, and nothing breaks your quests or your stats. It's just too bad the cars in the game still handle like cardboard boxes on stone wheels. Overall, however, DIR feels like a finished product, whereas the original Dead Island felt like a late-stage beta.\n\nDead Island Riptide gives you more of the combat-heavy open-world goodness you crave at the expense of a rather mediocre plot and some odd cosmetic bugs. If you want an immersive, beautiful open-world experience or just want a satisfying limb dismemberment simulator, then DIR is a good fit for you. If you hated Dead Island, or if you want something other than your standard "zombie virus" plot, then this game will disappoint you.","February 3, 2014","true","38.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RopeDrink/recommended/216250/","RopeDrink","RopeDrink","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RopeDrink/","81 products in account","Having bought DI1, DI:R and DI:E in one bundle - I decided to sit my butt down and play through them back to back, starting with good old DI which I had completed back in 2011. This allowed me to flow from DI and DI:R and review it fresh from memory - And make a proper comparison. It also allowed me to play both of the games 'up to date' version, whereas a lot of 'old' reviews complained of 'bugs' that do not exist anymore, thankfully.\n\nThat is the first thing - While the game has it flaws, just like DI did - The later version has absolutely no 'blockers'. Not once did the game crash, become unplayable, or put any unintentional issue in my way to stop me playing. Gameplay was smooth, with one single instance of minor FPS drop in one specific area (while using FRAPS) on my beastly computer - And even then, it was for a barely noticeable amount of time.\n\nStory wise - Well, nobody plays DI for the story... After all, there's only so much most games can do when dealing with zombie apocalypses - And so it centers on the characters. All previous characters, and sub-characters (temporarily) appear - So you can go from DI to DI:R, import your favourite characters progress and dive right back into kicking some ♥♥♥. What is worth noting is that the developers finally understood that having a 100% playable roster that is barely likeable is a bad thing - And so, they've altered stories and interactions to make the characters even just that TINY bit more likeable, which is a good thing. Even the sub-characters who tag along might leave a small impression on you.\n\nCombat is same old same old. Yes, there are some minor tweaks here and there, as well as a few new additions, which means it is 'slightly' improved from DI - But overall it's pretty much the same - Which some would love, while others will hate. If you enjoyed crafting your own gear and then playing 'how many bones can I break before I kill this walker' then you won't be disappointed. There are now more variations of familiar zombies, as well as a slightly increase beastiary (new enemies) - And a feature I loved was adding little grindable instances all around the map which contain not only valuable items and quest items, but sub-bosses with their own minor stories, even if they are simple souped up versions of existing monsters.\n\nThe 'team quests' and 'base defense' idea was nice though thankfully not overdone - As the base defending is predictable and samey, though it does add more zombie carnage, which is never bad. Singleplayers will get to enjoy watching the other cast-members loitering around and passing comments on the current situation, which gives them more 'presence' compared to DI1, where they only appeared in cut-scenes, or multiplayer.\n\nOne major improvement is the fact that flares and flashlight are now relevant. Some areas are almost completely pitch-black and force you to conserve battery power, bring flaming weapons, or toss flares around just so you can see if there's a walker waiting around that corner who wants to nibble your giblets. This sadly only partially ups the tension (I wont say 'scares' as it's still not scary) but it's a very welcome change.\n\nThe locations are gorgeous and far improved on DI1, with some great set-pieces and good pacing which breaks the two maps up between flooded jungles, creepy tunnels, zombie infested bungalows full of bosses, city-scape, wooden villages and laboratories. Even if the game at times may look like DI, that look doesn't stay long - And Riptide feels completely unique to it.\n\nUnfortunately, just like DI, the game falls flat by the climax - With an uninteresting boss and a silly 'mutation' twist on the story - And the ending, which is open to interpretation, seems to have annoyed more than it did satisfy - Though with DI2 on the horizon, we can only hope loose ends are tied up in the new game.\n\nOverall - I am extremely happy to have purchased Riptide - And to have played it with far less bugs than what were reported with before.\n\nUltimately - If you really liked DI1 and can stomach more of the same - Then Riptide is essentially DI1.5 - A nicer looking and improved version of the game you either loved or hated.\n\nMe? I loved it. Thumbs up!","August 1, 2014","true","39.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The characters are the same with only one new addition to the group, the gameplay is identical and the environment isn't very exciting. That being said, the game still provides hours of endless zombie maiming fun and if you liked the first game, you'll like Riptide.\n\nPros:\n- Huge range of weapons including more guns!!\n- Zombie killing is still as fun as ever\n- The game runs and looks beautiful\n\nCons:\n- Nothing new from the original\n- Lack of characters\n- Best enjoyed in co-op\n","August 6, 2014","true","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
