You'd imagine it to be WASD, but no, its more like ZQSD. Z is forward and Q is left strafe. But S & D do what theyre supposed to.\nThere is no sprinting mechanic, your character only leans forward like he is perpetually about to trip, with no increase in speed.\nNight vision is supposed to be easy on your eyes because of the green colors, however, this game managed to give me a headache with theirs.\nIn my, approx. 10-15 minutes of wandering around the first room of the game, I couldn't find the key i was supposed to find, because everything is the same shade of green and slightly blurry, so you cant find anything. I ran around in circles and the only thing i found was a camera battery shaped like a box.\n\nI don't recommend this game","March 27","false","0.3"," 189 of 199 people (95%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","95","189","199","16","14"

I really did! It came out just a few hours ago and being a huge survival and psycological horror fan I wanted to be one of the first to try it. I am disappointed to say the least. I made it to chapter 3, before what I can only assume was a bug halted my progress and I could continue no farther. Though honestly, I was through anyway.\n\nThe control mechanics made play difficult and unsatisfiying, that being said, figuring out how to control your character was the most interesting part of the game. the story was not only flaky and cliche from the getgo but the "monsters" were pathetic. They simply scurry from blankness back into blankness. there was no errie, running behind a corner before dissapearing, foreshadowing that they still might be luring around a corner somewhere. you just saw them appear and dissapear, never to be seen again. Even the maps themselves were low quality and repeditive.\n\nThere were obvious parts of the game that were inspired by other fantastic games of the genre, such as Anmesia and Layers of Fear, though fans of these games would easily recognize them as cheap knock offs.\n\nIn conclusion, If you're really still interested after what I assume will be the string of bad reviews to come, wait for a sale, its not worth $10. and im talking a good sale. not 10%, not 50%, at least 75% off.","March 27","false","0.8"," 101 of 105 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","101","105","3","6"

Then Please Watch This Video FIRST As This Video Exposes The Developer's Lies and Shady Actions & Response To Criticism:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbGSK5jdcrQ\n\nSee my Video Review here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4ZOXjy8q8w\n\nThis game set a new record for my lowest Stream review score ever, beating out 175 other reviews from me for an all new record of a 3% score!  (And this was before I saw the shady actions by the developer in response to my negative review and other player's criticism)\n\nI played this game for about the most monotonous 40 min of my gaming life trying really hard to find something that might be of value or that might even scare me even a little.. and it just didn't happen.\n\nThe game is horribly dark with no options to adjust it to help you see better, and you are forced to use your night vision which has a battery that runs out.  As you might expect, combine night vision with already dark and blurry graphics and you get a muddled green game that makes your experience playing much worse then it should be.\n\nTo make matters worse, the controls are the most awkward movement controls I've ever seen in any game.  Z moves forward, S (above the Z key) moves you backward.. and Q straffes you left while D straffes you right.  I noticed the developer responded to another review complaining about these controls telling that reviewer that the controls can be changed in the options.  I could be wrong, but this seems to be a flat-out LIE because there is no in-game options anywhere, and the only movement options are in the unity game launcher window that comes up when you launch the game.  In that launcher, as I show in my video.. the movement controls are set to the standard WASD, so changing the controls doesn't seem possible what-so-ever in any way.\n\nIn 40+ minutes of wandering aimlessly around green halls and doors, I saw 3 cutscenes where the computer takes control of your character to show you most of the preview video highlights, but nothing here is "scary" in the least bit.  The game makes no sense, and makes you search over the same areas over and over again until a random or time-trigger suddenly changes your environment or "pops" in a key onto a table you've already passed earlier.\n\nThere's an April Fool's game on Steam now called "Watch Paint Dry" and it is obviously nothing but a joke, but I guarantee you that it would be as much, probably more "fun" then this "Unconscious" game is.\n\nDeveloper(s) Feedback...  I honestly want to give you feedback that you can use, and I understand that making a game is a time consuming affair.  Please chalk this project up as a "learning experience", and scratch it completely.  My advice is to study some of the highly rated horror games and see the differences between this and what makes a "good" horror game that people want.  The best thing I can say is that if YOU don't want to play ..and you can't even enjoy your own game, then it's probably not something you want to launch on Steam.  I'm sure you have skills that could be shown off much better then what is revealed in this game.  Don't give up, just try again and remember... If you don't enjoy/want to play your own game, it's very likely not something that you want to try and "sell" on Steam.","March 28","false","1.0"," 112 of 123 people (91%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","91","112","123","10","11"

But if you are into these type of games you know what to expect. What I look for is a step forward of the template and found nothing in this game to offer me this so far.\nWhat I mean by this? FNAF worked well as it offered short play but different ways to play the game offering you a sense of security and plays with expectations. This game is not as tight as this. From a more open horror game I love sub-context give me something to work my brain around, while my mind is tied up and the atmosphere builds a good game developer would use this immersion. But with a game rotates around the easier format or pure boredom with scares to break it up. If you a horror fan fullstop give it a go, if your a game looking for something new or worth a while I say take your money and buy yourself a Pizza it'll last longer, give your more fun, and if you buy from the local store so you can be scared of the hygiene.\nhttps://youtu.be/ekZ50jWtvXQ","March 28","false","0.7"," 66 of 68 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","66","68","0","4"

Tell me if any of this sounds vaguely familiar:  Asylum?  Green night-vision?  Wheelchairs and trolleys everywhere, SWAT-style dudes with guns duking it out with supernatural psychopaths...ring any bells yet?\n\nBefore all you law students rush to get Red Barrels on the phone, though, it has to be said that UNlike Outlast, this game completely and utterly lacks any action whatsoever.  At least as far as I've progressed (more on that shortly).  So if it's a cheap knock-off of Outlast with SOME of the atmosphere but absolutely NONE of the chase sequences you're looking for, you may have come to the right place.  But wait...don't hit that buy button just yet...\n\nThis game has problems.  BIG problems.  You may have guessed that already by all the negative reviews swamping the Store page.  Firstly, there's the controls, which the dev recently claims to have fixed, but I'm afraid that I'm still having to use Z to go forward and S to go backward (no, I'm not joking), so...yeah, that's a bit of a problem.  Due to the merciful lack of reflexes-dependent action, however, I HAVE managed to get about four chapters in just by holding down Z and shift, and moving about with the mouse.  So that's ALMOST acceptable.  ALMOST.  Finding myself, two attempts in a row, in an area of a sewer (again, sound vaguely familiar?) where I either eventually freeze or just plain-and-simply can't tell which frickin' way I'm facing, and thusly cannot progress, is a little LESS acceptable I'm afraid.\n\nSo for now I'm giving up, and joining the ranks of the innumerable negative reviews, as much as some part of me almost wants to give this a thumb-up.  Why on earth would I want to do such a thing, you ask?  'Cause I've played far, far worse here on Steam, especially of late and especially within the first-person horror genre...and there's actually been some semblance of atmosphere and a couple of semi-spooky moments thus far, all of which indicate that with a bit of work this could maybe prove at least vaguely worthwhile.  By NO stretch of the imagination does this justify anywhere NEAR the ten dollar price-tag, but if the dev see fits to lower that price considerably, as well as fix the controls and any other bugs which might be preventing folk like myself from reaching the end of his game, I may well see fit to turn the thumb-down the other way round.  But that's the very, very least he has to do...oh, and it would also be nice if he would stop taking down all those forum posts and comments, while he's at it.  Not exactly encouraging behaviour from a first-time developer.\n\nUnconscious?  Unconscionable, more like it.  Fix the game, Mr Manai, and cut the ♥♥♥♥ with the unprofessional antics.  This may still be a salvageable situation for you, but that tail is gonna have to go firmly between your legs and stay there for a while, methinks.  Good luck to you, here's hoping you wake up and do the right thing, eh?  Signed Sincerely, The Best Chance You Have For A Positive Review On This Store Page (hint, hint).\n\nVerdict: 4.5/10.","March 29","false","1.3"," 43 of 46 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","43","46","5","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kagespartan/recommended/449230/","kagespartan","Lord Crocosquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kagespartan/","881 products in account","Since the developer of this farce he wants to call a psychological horror game wants to play silly meltdown games and lowered the price in an apparent attempt to increase sales before word spreads too far, I thought I'd bite a $4 bullet and actually play his game.\n\nI wish I had resisted the temptation.\n\nHere are a few things to gripe about:\n\n1) Sound. If you're going to use sound design to set the tone and make the player jump at shadows, that's fine. Initially, the existing design does that rather well. However, after the first few minutes, the Player gets so inundated with the same twenty seconds or so on a loop that thet gain the ability to tune it out. It turns what could have been a good way to get attention to events into a non-issue.\n\n2) Puzzle(s): In the time I spent with the game, I found one puzzle that confounded me for even a minute, and that was crystal clear once I got an overview of the room. Escape the Room can be done better.\n\n3) Is this memes? Not quite, but it does violate a lot of the cardinal sins of Psych Horror games. It's set in an (apparently) abandoned hospital, it's murky and filthy, invisible walls everywhere (including places they should most definitely not be), Sawtoothed chunks of levels, Key Hunting, the list goes on and on. About the only thing we didn't do was hunt up scraps of paper in the first couple of chapters, and I'd lay bets that that's a thing later on.\n\n4) Controls/bugs: Bad Dev is Bad. If you're going to deal in people that don't live in your region, then at least have someone from that region test it. The Dev made the claim that they had dealt with the control issue, an as of this writing they had not. Usually, this is enough to get a downvote off the top, but the problems with this game and its drama-dev go so much deeper...\n\nBefore I forget, the description notes are all wrong-- the aircraft you're flying (and would have killed you had you crashed it like that) is an F-16 Fighting Falcon, as is the "unknown" aircraft that brings you down. No jumping, and the laws of physics apparently don't apply to our friend "miller" when he takes a long drop in an elevator and is merely knocked unconscious at the bottom rather than being turned into chunky salsa.\n\nAdd to that a few people that can't get the game to start from the title screen for various reasons, the mouse hanging in the menu during play (which you can get around), seams in some of the textures, and random dots in odd colors hanging around, objects partially embedded in floors and the like, the game barely qualifies as a half-buttocked Alpha, never mind a game worthy of being in the store as a full release.\n\nI write this after cajoling the dev about his bad behavior on the discussion pages, and taking a ban as a result. I'm currently making a video review on the game, which will appear as soon as I can get it all done. It will be posted here at that time.\n\nIn the mean time, unless you like Really Bad Games and want to support another Digital Homicide-style dev, avoid this game at all costs-- even if they offer to pay you. It's just not worth it. As of now, the game is an abject failure, and is currently first in the running for Worst Game of 2016.\n\nLet's make games fun again!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV-v9vl0eR0","March 29","false","0.7"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","28","30","0","5"

I want my time back!\n\nThe developer had outright lied about his controls being fixed, they are not fixed it is still Z to move forward, Q to slide left, D to slide right, and S is back-up.  There are no menus that will fix this and changing the option in the unity engine menu when you launch the game doesnt fix the controls even if you set it to WASD.  So the developer is an outright LIAR just to try and get more sales.  He also deleted my thread just asking if the controls has been fixed to WASD within minutes after I asked because I wanted to know before I purchased it.  Why is he deleting so many posts and banning so many people?  If I didn't know better, I'd think this guy is a Adolf Hitler of game devs!

The most ironic thing about this is the fact that a message appears at the beginning that says "don't play this if you scare easily" as if this game is actually scary. Spoiler alert, it's the least scary "horror game" you will ever play. Please note the quotation marks on horror and game.\n\nLet's start with the controls. So instead of W moving you forward, Z instead moves you forward but S and D still move you back and right but A doesn't move you left instead Q moves you left. These controls will make your hands cramp up within a few minutes of playing this. It also doesn't help that the dev claimed the controls were fixed TWO TIMES! That's two times he claimed the controls were fixed and guess what, THEY'RE STILL NOT FIXED!\n\nAs for the game itself, it's a first person horror game where you're inside a mental institution with weird crazy people running around and a green night vision camera to see in the dark. We also have army people come in to fight the crazy people but of course the army is no match for these psychos. Sound familiar? Yes it would appear that someone's played Outlast and said, "I can do exactly this" except unlike in Outlast where there was lots of intense action scenes, Unconscious is the most boring thing I've ever played. You know how in Outlast there were moments where your camera was almost out of battery so you were frantically running around trying to find more batteries, well say goodbye to that in Unconscious because now the camera has a super long battery life and there's really no chance that you'll run out. This makes the game incredibly boring. A horror game should keep you at the edge of your seat but this just makes me feel dead inside from pure boredom. It's the exact opposite of scary and I was yelling at it to do something scary because it was boring the crap out of me.\n\nThere was also a part where I got stuck and had to alt+f4 out of the game. After restarting I clipped through a wall and fell out of the map. I then restarted it for a second time and the game immediately crashed when I tried to load up the level. Pathetic is all that I could say. This game is completely and utterly pathetic. I couldn't think of a worse horror game if I tried.\n\nI would feel embarrassed if my name was attached to something this awful but this dev doesn't seem to feel any shame for making something so bad although, this guy also said all negative reviews were trolls, said that Jim Sterling was deliberately trying to make the game look like it couldn't start, and is deleting forum posts so it looks like he’s pretty stupid.\n\nThis game is poorly made, boring, not scary at all, and it rips off elements from good horror games like Outlast. There's no reason to spend your money on this pile of garbage. It's boring and pathetic and you should stay as far away from this crap as possible.\n\nBut why should you listen to me? According to the dev, I'm just a troll because I'm writing a negative review.","April 18","false","0.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"
