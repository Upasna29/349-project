To me, a guy who is in the process of actually learning how to drive, playing this game gives me an insight of what driving can and cannot be like. Obviously this game, being an indie game, will have its flaws and bugs and errors etc. (I only experience a "space driving" glitch where I flew from one hill to another unhurt during the free ride.) But in the end, for $5 USD it is a nice buy. If you are interested in a game that gives you a smooth, enjoyable, educative, and mildly hectic driving simulation, then "Safety Driving Simulator: Car" is the game for you. For a quick note to all future customers: I didn't run this game on my actual gaming PC: A Core2Quad Q6600 with Dual 9800GT's at 1024mb ddr3 total video memory, and 3GB DDR2 RAM. INSTEAD: I ran this game on my AIO Dell with 4GB DDR3 RAM, A Sandy Bridge Pentium G620T 2.2Ghz Dual Core Processor, and Intel HD Graphics. The game ran at 1600x900 at low setting with:\n\n30FPS at the Worst\n60FPS Most of the Time\n\nOverall This game would get a B Rating from me.\n\n84/100","May 5","true","2.6"," 5 of 21 people (24%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","24","5","21","0","0"
