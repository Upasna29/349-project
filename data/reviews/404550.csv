You are left in a field which is about the size of your back garden and you have to build your camp up from scratch. The game play is just horribly boring and has been done so many times before. What makes this title even worse is that we have another over saturated genre included…zombies. Every night you have to defend your simple plot of land against zombies. There is no challenge what so ever in this as you have a gun with unlimited ammo, so there is nothing even remotely close to becoming difficult.\n\nThere is no tutorial in the game, meaning you have to work absolutely everything out for yourself, even though there isn’t much to learn, it would have been nice to know how to farm your crops from the start instead of me destroying them by accident from using the wrong tools.\n\nGraphically, it is actually better looking than vanilla Minecraft (no mods), the colours are bright and pleasant to look at, but that’s about all this game has to offer. The game will run at your screens native resolution, so I was surprised to see I was in the game at 4k.\n\nI have only been playing for about half an hour now and I am done. There is nothing in this game that makes me want to even load it up again. People may think I am being too harsh given that I got this game for free, but honestly the genre has been done over and over again and there is nothing new that can be added to this type of game now.  The game is still in early access but it seriously needs a lot of work for it even to be considered a try out even for fans of this genre.  I will give the developers some credit though, they are actively updating the game, but for me it’s a definite no unfortunately.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I can't say it takes place in a certain location, as there are several to choose from once unlocked. The story... Well you're a farmer trying to survive in zombie infested locations-don't ask me why and how he ended up farming in locations like these.\n\nDead Acres provides you with so many in-game items to choose from, and a plethora of pesky zombies to deal with. It has turrets, an assorted array of crops for you to plant and harvest, primary weapons, tools, decorations and traps for you to lay in the battlefield.\n\nAs you can see this game has plenty to offer. With a low price tag like that, I'd say it's a great buy.","November 24, 2015","true","1.8"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","14","23","5","1"

For $2.50 it's really worth it.  I would've spent the whole amount on this game but I got it on sale.\n\nThere's enough upgrading to keep it interesting so far.   It's like tower defense, where you're invaded by zombies each night and then during the day, you farm to make money.

It offers a wide variety of fun and it doesn't get old. You get to play as a dank farmer that shoots up zombies at night with unlimited ammo, what more could you ask? At the same time you are playing a farm simulator (dank simulator) which everyone can enjoy and you don't have to wait like a month for food to grow like in the real world. It is a game very worth the 5 buckorinoes $$ and if you don't buy it now you may have to pay more in the future when it is finished. Also saying that it is an early release, I was very surprised how amazing the game was. People will say it is like Minecraft but don't listen to them. It's NOTHING like Minecraft at all, and that was what made me unsure of buying it since I wasn't sure to believe them or not. But good game, looking forward to playing it a lot in the future, and hope you feel the same about it as I do if you buy it.\n\nPros\n- GUNS\n- ZOMBIES\n- FARMINGGGGGGGG\n- BUILDING A SICK BASE WITH GUNS\n- Only $5\n\nCons\n- I bit hard to understand in the beginning, but very easy to catch on\n- Kinda glitchy but not so much, just here and there (understanding that it is a early release though)\n- Can make you rage quit sometimes","April 22","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Firstly the day should be twice as long for the players to perform the actions provided; mining rocks, chopping trees, placing defenses and more. One more thing i think this game could benefit from is more rounds that slowly become more difficult so the player has more time to adjust. Playing the game for myself I had these issues and it less fun then it could have been. This is just my opinion but, it would be great if an update could become available.","January 2","true","2.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

Cute idea, intuitive controls, and just enough mayhem to be really engaging.\n\nIn future updates/releases I'd like to see much slower day/night cycles (or an option to adjust it, like difficulty), some sort of radar since its impossible to tell where the zombies are coming from without directional sound, and maybe a cursor highlight-object option so you can tell where your hoe/see/gun is pointed easier.  The crosshairs get lost easily.\n\nBuy the game!  Give them money!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/particlepunch/recommended/404550/","particlepunch","Exceptional Gayer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/particlepunch/","210 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have one word to describe this game: ADDICTIVE!\n\nAs I write this review, I am exactly 100 minutes into the game, and this was all in one sitting. I thought I would stick around for half an hour, but i just got so involved straight away! There are so many features, and considering it is in early access I really want to see where it goes.\n\nThe main way to describe the game would probably be a first person zombie shooter farming sim tower defense. At least, that's what i've got from it so far. The game just seems to have a perfect balance, meaning you feel like you have lived through hell when you survive a night. This is a true survival game. You always seem to have just enough money to build a decent wall, only to have it torn down by some zombie that wants your brain. It requires strategy, as you need to even your budget out between replacing plants that will inevitably have been devoured and destroyed by zeds at some point in the night. It is a great game.\n\nThe art style is nice too. Like lots of games, they have gone for the blocky, Minecraft-esque aesthetic, but instead of being a carbon copy like other titles, they have created a unique environment of play. The days feel warm and bright in stark contrast to the nights which are dark and deadly. The zombies may not look intimidating from a distance, but when they are tearing at your flesh and your base is overrun, you learn to fear them pretty quick.\n\nOverall, the game is a good challenge and very enjoyable and addictive. I can't wait to see how the developers add to it in the future.\n\n","January 3","true","7.3"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

And The graphics are pretty basic, but good for what they are. It still needs some streamlining, but  Overall, this game is definately worth buying, especially considering that it will be updated and improved from here.\n\nThere are some issues i would like to go over to help the developer(s?) improve the game.\n\nFirst of all, very occasionally (i think it happened to me about twice in almost 4 hours of gameplay) jack will simply not appear. And while we are on the issue of bugs i found that after i used the tractor about half the time i wouldn't find all of the food in my inventory when going to trade with jack. Closing and then re-opening trade with jack seemed to fix this. I didn't check in my inventory before going to trade though.\n\nSecond of all i understand that there are tools you can buy to collect natural resources (mining rock ect.) but even with the tractor i just couldn't find the time to do this with all the improving defences and whatnot to be done.\n\nThird of all, i had some issues with the hammer. I bought it because i made some mistakes in my defence plan but i found that it just took to long to destroy objects. Especially if you've started building with stronger materials. So rather than help improve my defences i just wasted a bunch of time and then gave up on trying. So i think that it definately needs to destroy things faster.\n\nLastly, i think that the whole turret system could use some streamlining. Maybe it's just me but i found i had to fiddle around with them alot. Maybe you could do something to make the whole generator thing easier?\n\nAs for ideas of things to put in the game, i think it would be cool to see something like a slime shooter that shoots a huge spray of slime that slows down any zombie it hits, and traps with a limited number of uses would be cool too. Like a pit trap, landmines, fire trap ect.\n\nAnd one more thing, i didn't do alot of testing for the shotgun but i found it to be pretty useless. I also just didn't use the grenade launcher at all because i heard that was useless too but i think thats going to be fixed. So yeah.\n\nalso, just something i wanted to share with you all, i saw a guide to the game but it turned out to be a russian sausage recipe with an english translation. So, thats pretty wierd.","January 17","true","7.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"
