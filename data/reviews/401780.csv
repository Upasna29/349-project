Unpolished: The game has "bad" graphics. (Not the good kind of "bad" retro graphics, but just plain ugly ones) and poor performance, and not to mention the real landscape images in the skybox (please just get rid of that!)\n...and more!\n\nThe game feels like a very early EARLY-ACCESS title, I understand it's just a simple arcade shooter, but it needs a lot of work. If it was cleaned up, it could be a really fun game to pass time.","September 10, 2015","false","0.2"," 60 of 64 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","60","64","0","0"

Enjoyed going on a killing spree more than trying to save the town. Load times also kill enthusiasm going into the next day. Interesting "lane defender" style concept, just not executed well.","September 11, 2015","false","0.7"," 43 of 58 people (74%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","74","43","58","10","0"

Apart from the subpar framerate the game is soo dark that it is very difficult to tell which colour characters are before you shoot them. Equally the lack of a real crosshair makes it difficult.\n\nCouple that with no menu mouse support and you have a game with a lot of promise but very much flawed. For our video showcasing the terrible framerate please look below:\n\nhttp://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/literal-first-play/150917_driveby-gangster-literal-first-play","September 16, 2015","false","0.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

The game certainly has potential and i really like what ive played of it so far however it is very buggy and glitchy at the moment. ive had the game crash on me 3 times and one of the levels bug out entirely. if the bugs were fixed this game would be much better.","September 13, 2015","false","2.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

The gun would constantly move upwards even without touching it. I made it through 9 days of rinse and repeat. Looks like at least 30 days for complete game but not sure. Don't feel like trying for it.","December 13, 2015","false","1.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

We are not ones who have the time to play epic, long term games which literally take over your life. We came through the old way of Mario Brothers and Pack Man, when they first arrived. We are from the beginning of the Internet! These were just after the days of the video arcade when the guns were not digital, but made of metal.  Do not  ask our ages.  What impresses us most about this game is the mood it sets, with a Film Noir flavor both in graphics and music. Terri especially liked the artwork in the city when she arrived to the cafe at night, reminiscent of  'Nighthawks' by the artist Edward Hopper.\n\nWe enjoyed that  each level is presented as a day in time, though short, this is unique as part of a whole month of days on the calendar. This is how the game's creator has chosen to challenge us.  The game play is simple, and only needs a mouse.\n\nDriveby Gangster provides hours of entertainment. Imagine playing in the fog, rain or total darkness. Picture a seaside with bad guys everywhere and you as the Gangster have to make the hit. Later it may be your turn to take a powder. Imagine ... this game is created by one man, not a cast of thousands.  We are also a fans of The Godfather. The Tommy Gun is perfect, for after all, this is in the 1940s. Yes it may be large but it is effective.    We thank you for a journey down Memory Lane\n\nCarlo and his gun-moll Terri","November 4, 2015","true","3.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It's basically a drive by shooting simulator with a very easy introduction and it gets progressively harder as you move through the stages.\n\nYou are sitting in a car which is automatically moving and you have to hit the gangsters in the crowds of people and minimize the casualties of innocent bystanders.\n\nFor the price, it's worth it.  I know the animation quality isn't the best but other than that, there's nothing really wrong about the game concept or execution.  There are a few issues I have with it, though.\n\n- no way to change sensitivity on controller analogs for look speed.  this makes it nearly impossible after just a few levels, however it is possible to use the mouse which moves 100 times faster so IMHO it's what you will want to be using for this game.\n\n- no way to see what your controls are beyond them being flashed at the screen at the very beginning.  I don't know how to speed up the car, I can't just hit start and see the controls in the options screen, nor is it in the main menu.  You seem to need to have to start a fresh game and memorize it right there.  Big oversight, I hope it gets patched into the in-game pause menu at some point.\n\nIt gets very difficult early into the game (7th day was starting to ramp up the difficulty quite a bit) so if there are ~30 days in the game, you might find this game to be difficult.  But hey, for $2, do you accept the challenge?\n\nI couldn't help but noticed the large majority of people are downvoting my review.  I guess this is one of those "downvote the positives and upvotes the negatives" sort of games where people are blindly voting because of some vendetta against poor animation quality.  That's fine.  The game isn't great but it's $2..\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR9BJ3FHNi0","September 10, 2015","true","0.3"," 23 of 84 people (27%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","27","23","84","5","1"
