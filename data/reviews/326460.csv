We had a single cannon shot to obliterate the landscape and attempt to destroy our opponent.  Shellshock Live includes over 250 weapons, I had hesitations that this would work.  Sometimes too much variety can be overload.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=624332808\n\nGladly this game has a massive grind to open up all the weapons.  I hate grinding in games, especially in PVP games.  So why do I think it is good in this case?  Well, the basic weapons are enough to enjoy the game to its full and recently the playerbase got a MASSIVE influx due to popular streamers publicising the game.  Meaning you are pitched against other players of same experience with same weapon loadouts.  I can imagine it could've been a problem with a small playersbase but not now.\n\nMaybe preferably I'd like to have access to all weapons without a grind and be able to custom select which to include on the server I create or join a server that has a selection I like to play with.  250+ weapons is a LOT to get to grips with so maybe the devs have implemented their introductions in the best way.  Time will tell...\n\nOne thing I didn't realise with Shellshock Live was that the most popular way of playing isn't turn-based but actually phase-based.  So every player is setting their power and trajectory and deciding which weapon to launch at the same time.  The result is very little waiting time for other players!!  It keeps the game and the fun flowing extremely effectively.\n\nTouraments have been added recently, I can't wait to try those!\n\nThe game is simple looking in design but the graphics are clean and effective.\n\nI'll be spending a lot fo time in Shellshock for sure, highly recommmended!!","February 14","true","52.0"," 117 of 136 people (86%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","86","117","136","11","14"

You'll be stuck on those basic weapons forever unless you have friends at the same levels as you, ensuring the game is actually half-way balanced.\n\nI like the game but find it hard to recommend to people starting off, as its huge grind factor to get to the fun stuff is very offputting.","June 14, 2015","false","7.8"," 76 of 104 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","76","104","8","1"

I specifically remember an Amiga game in the 90's called Scorched Tanks / Scorched Earth which was an all-time favourite.\n\nThe problem here is that, due to the leveling and XP system, no-one is ever on an equal footing.  It becomes less a test of your skill and more a case of how many weapons or how much armor you have "unlocked".  There is no game mode available where all of this is disabled and you can fight someone on a level playing field.  The game is a mobile phone app and it is a great shame.\n\nI implore the developers to introduce a game mode (for us old timers perhaps?) where all of the weapons are unlocked and no-one receives any of those unlockable benefits (luck, armor, cannon etc..).  I would have no hesitation in recommending the game if only it had that option.  In this mode no one would earn XP, it would simply be a true battle of skills where everyone has the same weapons and abilities.  This is fun but us adult game players dont want to have to grind our way up to unlock all the things we thought we just paid for.","March 2","false","52.6"," 336 of 533 people (63%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","63","336","533","23","24"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/326460/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1506 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nShellShock Live is a Steam adaptation for a web game with the same name. There are many things that are done much better in this version and those will be described below. It is a turn-based strategy game where the rules are simple: destroy the enemy tanks. Being easy to understand and fun to play, you have to try it out.\n\nPros:    This is an online game and the devs cared enough to transfer it to Unity Engine, not just leave it in Flash. That is a huge plus.\nThere are no microtransactions. I was very surprised when I found this out and I'm glad they decided to keep this out of their game. All of the weapons, skins and other things that are usually behind the paywall can be unlocked by playing.\nBeside being microtransaction-free, this game is cheap by itself already.\nGraphics are simple, colourful and very nice to look at.\nThe amount of weapons in this game is astonishing. Seriously, there are more than 200 of them. And above all, they get leveled up as you use them.\nBoth multiplayer and simgleplayer modes. Are you out of friends? No problem, you have 80 singleplayer missions to complete and you can also level up with them. Great!\nYou have a test map where you can freely try out all of the weapons without quantity restrictuons.\nLeveling system. By playing, you get experience and when you get to the next level, you even get a point that can be spent on your skill tree.\nA lot of game modes and maps. You can play team deathmatch, player deathmatch, who deals the most damage ...\nThere are random wormhole and bumper spawns that prevent people from firing with the same angle and power over and over again. That is good in case some is locked on you and is hitting you repeatedly, but it comes with a pretty bad bug. See cons.\nA cheaper 4-pack. Great if you have friends to play with.\nLinux and MacOS support\nCons:    Well, the amount of people that are playing is quite small. There are very few servers and even those are usually full so you need to wait a lot or have friends that are ready to play.\nRemember the microtransaction-free part of this review? Well, you can get everything without playing, but you get things painfully slow.\nSingleplayer missions are divided into 8 sets. This would be fine, if you wouldn't need to complete all the missions in the previous set to unlock the next one. If you just can't figure one mission out, you are pretty much stuck with multiplayer.\nThose obstacles that can bump bullets away can sometimes spawn on players, making them impossible to kill. It can be pretty unfair at the moments. Screenshot\nThe final verdict:This is a great game and doesn't require much practice to be extremely good at. For example, I have played against players level 48, 24 and 30 and I won the round. My level was 4 at the time. It's a pretty addicting game and it's fun to play. The two biggest flaws are a small player base and long matches. Other than that, I had a lot of fun with this game.\nIf you are not sure about buying, you can try the game here[www.shellshocklive2.com]. If you like the game, you should totally buy the whole game on Steam. It comes with more levels, weapons and with some Steam features integrated.\n\nGreetings,\nBird\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free.

Hold on, you little red tank, you - let me get the right angle, power and a devastating weapon to wipe you off this map! Oh bugger! Not only did I miss him, but I managed to exterminate my teammate! What a shock . . . it is ShellShock Live after all!\n\nShellShock Live is an action multiplayer game where you take control of a cute little green tank in battle. This game is primarily a multiplayer game but it has a campaign mode which includes 81 missions to beat. The campaign mode will help you to understand the game and weapons.  Importantly, it will show you how to get the right angle for your shell to hit your enemy at the end of its trajectory in order to inflict maximum damage. You will be able to level up and unlock several weapons, maps and parts. Each time you level up, you will be rewarded with a token which you can use to upgrade the chassis, the track, the gun and even the luck of your tank.\n\nWhen you are ready to fight online, you can create your own game or join an existing game. Most of the games I played online were 4 vs 4 but you might get to play 8 vs 8 if you are lucky. I must warn you, it was mayhem! Well, I was constantly targeted with some insane weapons! As you enter a game, you will spawn on one side of the map with your teammates and your opponent will spawn on the opposite side. Then you will have 45 seconds to move your tank to either a better and safer position or leave it where it is if you are happy with the location. The next turn (also 45 seconds) you will start fire shells or be the recipient of the enemy projectiles and so on and so forth until one of you is the last tank rolling! You might manage a maestro hit on one of your enemies and a golden gear might appear on the map - make to collect it as soon as possible. You will use the golden gear at the gear shop to buy addition gizmos.\nA fair number of people are playing ShellShock Live online and it is very easy to find and play a game; on top of that the community is very friendly too. You also have a leader board and you can even create your clan.\n\nGraphically the game looks good and it runs very well and I have not experienced any drop-out online. This is a fun, addictive game with plenty of re-playability\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Fun and addictive game\n-	100’s of weapons and maps to unlock\n-	Good number of upgrades and tank customization\n-	Great value for money\n-	Achievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Random obstacles within turns can be painful at times\n\nShellShock Live is a great multiplayer game! Very addictive and seriously fun!\n\n9/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ExplodingMuffin6/recommended/326460/","ExplodingMuffin6","Black Widow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ExplodingMuffin6/","103 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIf you've ever played the flash versions of this game, you'll love this one!\n\nFrom the very two shellshock live games on flash, i became hooked. But not in a bad way at all!\n\nThis simple, yet fun game isn't very demanding in terms of computer specs, it manages to still look great even on it's lowest quality settings it offers. But when it's quality settings are set to the maximum it allows... It looks simply stunning and beautiful is all i can really say.\n\nFeatures: Multiplayer.\nSingle player (campaign).\nRobust graphics when set on the highest quality.\nNew HUB.\nOver 58 maps to choose from! I think, i counted but i could be wrong.\nCustomizable tanks.\nUse items to get a little upper hand on your enemy.\nUp to 8 player battles.\nTeam Death match, and Free for all to play against your friends.\nOver 200 weapons!\nMore things to come as this game is updated!\n\nThe gameplay: The gameplay is different from the first two previous games. You'll notice that the power of your shots are much more powerful if you've ever played the previous flash versions of this game. But don't allow that to deter you from purchasing this wonderful game! Sure it's hard at first to master the way you shoot, but after some practice you'll be good as you were before. And if you're completely new to the game, don't worry a thing. it doesn't take long at all to learn the mechanics of the game.\n\nA little info about the game:\nThe single player campaign has 80 missions to do, some more hard than others. You'll have a tough time with them garuanteed. Some require you to really think hard on how to succeed in them but don't worry it's not impossible some have already beaten all of that already!\n\nWhen you first start off you won't be able to do many things such as move as far as others when you join a match, don't worry this is normal. You must earn these things called ''Tank Tokens'' you obtain these from leveling up that you may use to upgrade your tank. You can choose to upgrade your tank as you see fit choosing from ''Chassis'' ''Armor'' (which also allows for the possibility to regenerate armor), Gun (chance to deal more damage to enemies), ''Track'' (let's you move faster and climb up and down down hills), and ''Luck'' (this helps you get loot from crates such as weapons, and armor).\n\nYou can use items to help you out a little these are the items.\nTracer: This item allows you to see where your shot will land before you shoot it, helpful if you're unsure about the shot you're about to take.\n\nTeleport: This item is new and was not in the previous shellshock game, it can teleport you anywhere on the map randomly.\n\nJetpack: This item allows you to jetpack to a location within the radius that the item allows you to.\n\nShields: Pretty sure this one is self explanatory, but i'll go ahead and explain anyways. This one engulfs you in a small bubble that protects you for one turn from all weapons. The weapon earthquake is an exception.\n\nSupply drops: When using them item you will see a small box float down from above your tank which provides you with random weapons.\n\nEMP Blast: This one is also new, currently this item messes with the enemy's aim.\n\n\n\n\nFinal conclusion:\nI would recommend this game to anyone who wants to just have a good time with friends, and likes to play something simple, fun and a little addicting once you get into it. So if you do get this game i hope you'll have as much fun as i do when i play it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","March 15, 2015","true","829.0"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","19","26","3","0"

While you get way more value over ssl2, it requires so much grinding to unlock everything. But at least you don't have to pay $300 for it all!\nThe game's still in beta and needs a lot of work! A tough job for just one man. Even now, the developer is continuing to update the game with bug fixes, new game modes, new weapons!\nThere are so few players it's difficult for everyone to find a game. Most of the few including myself who went and bought the game early are now high levels, making it difficult for new players to grow. But that's why I'm advocating this game here on Steam! So we can have more players and hopefully all the new players will be able to find a game with people of their level! I so desperately want this game to grow. It's 5 freaking bucks, what are ya waiting for! If you don't like it you can get your money back!\nThe aiming is different than ssl2! Now it takes less power to shoot farther. If you were good at arcing in ssl2, you're gonna have to relearn those angle numbers. But it's very easy to adjust! You're going to find the aim makes more sense than in ssl2. Certain weapons have been nerfed and buffed. For example nuke did over 100 on ssl2, now it does 80 on steam. Napalm did around 88 dmg without crit on ssl2, but now it can do well over 100 depending on your upgrades. But maxing out your barrel yields a much higher chance of crit hits than putting several coins on a crit barrel on ssl2 which is probably why the nerfs are there. Some weapons that have been made weaker become very op with a maxed barrel!\nThere's still many weapons missing from ssl2 that are not currently in the steam version. Spligger, EE bomb, fast forward, zits, phantom, moon ball, bullseye, supersniper, drill bits, kamakazi, anvil and some others I can't remember. But there's some cool new weapons too!\nThe way you unlock weapons is different. First you have to unlock the first tier of a weapon, then you have to keep using it to unlock the next tier and so forth. For example you start out with a digger. Keep using it to unlock mega digger. Keep using that and you unlock excavation! So instead of just using the strong weapons and ignoring the weak ones, the game basically forces you to use everything so you can get a well rounded arsenal. The kicker though is that while you may unlock higher tiers it's still possible to get lower tiers in the mix. For example, if you unlocked excavation, you're still gonna get regular diggers sometimes. The tank leveling system is also different. In ssl2 there are 50 levels, then you can prestige and restart to lvl 1. On steam there's 80 standard levels. But after that there are 19 "prestige" levels up to 100 that require much more xp than the previous levels. It's done this way so the people who have less time can still get to a high level. If you got a lot on your plate and can't play all day, you can reach level 80 in maybe 3-6(?) months with occasional play. But those who have the free time can still level up and get to the REALLY good stuff.\nThere are NO MICROTRANSACTIONS and there never will be! It's pay once and everything is yours! You can still collect tank coins now dubbed "gears" but they appear way more often. You will get gears almost every single game! You can spend them all in a shop where you can buy new weapons and maps and themes. There's currently not much but it has good potential.\nThere is a single player for new players that will help them gain a good amount of levels before competing with the big boys online. The missions can get very annoying and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ty especially in the last few sets, but EVERYONE can do them!\nThere are more game modes and variety online! You can have up to 600 hp games! You can have up to 8 players in one game!\nWhile many of the players now are high levels, most of them are very polite and fair and will be willing to help anyone if they are simply asked politely. WE DO NOT WANT TO TURN ANYONE AWAY! We are desperate for more people! There are still problems with the game. But it has ENORMOUS potential and I strongly recommend that you at least give it a try!\nYou can choose not to buy and stick with ssl2. Or you can buy it now while the cheap price lasts and help grow the community and recommend this fine game to others! Or if you are completely new to this little franchise, go for it! It's very easy to learn the gameplay and a lot of fun! I hope this answers any questions and uncertainties you have about the game and I hope this helps you decide whether you want to buy the game or not. Leave me a polite comment if you have a question, I will try to answer as soon as possible!","June 19, 2015","true","836.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

More so for one like ShellShock Live, because it involves mini tanks, which many consider infantile. However I should note that this game has that unexplainable magic under the hood. Sure it doesn't have amazing graphics, complex controls and generally looks like some cheap flash game, but you'll never know what this game is all about untill you try it.

I've been playing the crap out of this game, and now want to go back with better knowledge and give it a more in-depth look.\n\nThe game is in early access, but I'm going to be mostly reviewing it as a full game. The game has been on Kongregate since 2010, also gaining a sequel in 2012, and has slowly grown and gotten better over those years. While I'm sure there are some features kChamp wants to implement before calling it a full release, as it stands the game is pretty much completed minus a few details that are small enough to look past. So keep that in mind while reading, and keep that in mind if you're thinking of buying the game.\n\nThere's two main modes to this game: Singleplayer and Multiplayer. Singleplayer has skirmish mode (just multiplayer against bots) and Campaign Mode (We'll get to it later). The multiplayer is online only, which is kind of disappointing since this seems like a hotseat kind of game. The developer has stated that it would take a re-build of the game to add hotseat, so don't expect it any time soon- if at all.\n\nGoing to start off with the multiplayer to explain how the game works. You're a tank, you shoot other tanks, your shots are affected by gravity, it's turn based. Sound familiar? Yes, it's like every other physics based fighter like worms, only the gimmick here is the sheer amount of weapons you have at your "disposal". 200+ apparently? You might think that's a bit much- sounds like quantity over quality. But most of the weapons are rather unique, and the ones that aren't are still upgraded versions of other weapons, meaning that there are only a handful that are "bad" or "useless". The sheer amount of situations that you can take based on your loadout each match is amplified greatly by this arsenal. Why the airquotes around "disposal"? You don't have all 200+ weapons unlocked to begin with, maybe only something like 15. Through levelling up your tank and your weapons, you unlock more weapons, subweapons, maps, parts for your tank, and skill points for your tank. This means that somebody who is level 80 is literally going to wipe the floor with a level 1. So my personal recommendation for new players is to buy the game during a sale or during some event that will draw more new players to the game for a while. But how is the levelling system? To start, fun. Later on? Long. The maximum level is around 80 or something, and apparently there's prestiges or some system similar that adds even more weapons to unlock. I've been playing this game at time of writing for 13.2 hours, and I'm only level 20. I doubt I'll ever hit anywhere even close to 80, and I doubt most players won't either. So there's going to be some weapons, maps and abilities that you'll just never see unless you're hardcore about it. The levelling up system for weapons is even LONGER, since they only get the exp that you damage people with. The only weapon i've upgraded currently is the sniper, and that's just because it deals crazy damage when you hit things with it, raking in exp. I have no idea how you're supposed to level up the basic shot 4 times, even if the threshold for exp is lower.\n\nThe campaign is like the grinding system: at first fun, then slowly becomes tedious. It's a series of skill and sometimes luck based challenges that net you crazy amounts of EXP the first time you beat them, and weapon unlocks for beating chapters. They start out fair, giving you difficult target practices and skirmishes with limited weapons, but then become absolutely ridiculous with no margin for error unless you've grinded in multiplayer to a crazy high level. About halfway through the target practices required so much accuracy and the bots became so hard that I just looked up a co-ordinate guide and restarted the mission until I got snipers. However, I still sort of enjoyed the campaign even though the difficulty curve was a bit steep, and think that it adds to the variety of an easily stale game otherwise.\n\nOther than that, the graphics are alright for what they are, the music is generic and there's only like 2 tracks (turn it off and put on your own) and the sound design is satisfying and chunky sounding. If the EXP rate gets fixed and the game retains at least a portion of it's playerbase, I'd definitely say this might be one of my favourite pick up and play multiplayer steam games. As it stands right now, it's just simply alright. The balance of having to grind forever to get something new and a too split playerbase just makes the game boring after a short time playing. It's definitely worth the price if you like the genre even right now though.","February 15","true","49.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

All reviews are at its current state; I firmly believe they can be 10/10s by the official release.\n\nSingle Player (7/10)\n\nSingle Player was a nice addition to this version.   It is a great for first time players as it introduces a large selection of weapons and strategies.  Players are forced to learn about and take advantage of essential aspects of the game such as portals, bumpers, items, etc.  As an introductory tool, it is fantastic.  My two only two concerns are something that can and likely will be fixed, but currently need to be addressed: opponent AI and mission amount/replayability.  At first the opponent AI was something that just was sort of funny at first, but by the later missions people can easily win by taking advantage of it.  Quite simply, if you put the computer opponent in a hole, they will shoot themselves over and over.  I do not think this is a pressing issue, but it is something that would be nice if it were fixed.  Secondly, it would be nice if there were more missions (or replayable ones).  Again, this isnt extremely pressing and is likely to be added in the future.  Perhaps have a daily challenge (ex: beat mission 8-6 in 5 tries or less for 10 gears!)\n\nWeapons (7/10)\n\nThe weapons look great.  They are fun and unique.  They are built for different situations which makes strategy more interesting.  However, there are two somewhat pressing issues.  First, is the leveling system.   The current system is fun, but once you level a weapon it is unlikely you will ever use the old version again.  Thus, the endgame weapon pool isnt that large.  I'm not sure exactly how this can be fixed.  One idea is once a weapon is unlocked it becomes independent from its older version (they are separate, you can get both in one game for an example).   The second issue is weapon balancing.  Particularly, the close range weapons.\nEDIT: So I took about the part about the OP close range weapons.  In the recent update, many were nerfed to do about half of what they use to do, which is a step in the right direction.  It also shows the developers are listening to the community.  There is still more balancing to be done, but these weapons were the main ones that needed to be changed, so balancing is not super urgent anymore.\n\nMultiplayer (8/10)\n\nLike I said, I love the portals, bumpers, items, maps, all that kind of stuff.  Multiplayer is pretty nice in its condition.  8 player games were added which is extra fun.  The only thing I dont get is what happened to points mode.  It was a good mode if you wanted to play a longer game that worked just fine in the online versions, not sure why it was removed.\nJust as a side note, I disagree with everyone complaining about the slow leveling system.  The game has been out for a few weeks and you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that you're only 15% of the way to max?  If the leveling system was made faster, then you all will be complaining that more levels will need to be added after max.  Be patient young jedis!\n\nOther upgrades (9/10)\n\nSkill tree is awesome.  Maybe add a little more juice to luck (gears in boxes?).  Gear shop is brand new but looking great.  Not too many tank customizations, but that can be easily added.\n\nOverall (8/10) (remember, this is for current state!)\n\nI just want to add something, especially for people who have never played.  This game is not some action intensive adventure.  In fact, it can get quite boring if it is all you do for a few hours.  Whats great about this game is that it does not demand so much attention.  Its the perfect distraction.  Once of my favorite things to do is to watch a sports game on tv and play this at the same time.  You dont even really have to think to play this; I played this during the 7 hour redsox-yankees game and was like "I wasnt really even paying attention to my computer, yet I leveled up a few times and did just fine!"  Thats what I love about this game.\nAs for the flaws, they are certainly fixable.  I believe that all these things can and will be fixed eventually.  For now, we will just have to wait.  The updates come pretty fast so it might not be long.  So I am going to keep playing and enjoying this game as it gets better and better!\n\nps: I would love to recommend which weapons should be balanced (and to what extent) if there is any interest","April 11, 2015","true","468.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","3"

However, the game is *exceptionally* grindy - so do not expect an experience filled with easy unlocks and meaningful progress. You're going to need hundreds of hours to reach the higher levels in this.\n\nHowever, if you have enough to buy a couple of 4 packs for your friends, you can have little competitions and matches within your own group and everything will generally be pretty fine, everyone will stick at approximately the same level and upgrade fairly evenly. This is the only real way to play the game.\n\nThe singleplayer missions are challenging enough to keep you busy for a little while, but again, you'll only level up to about a maximum of 15 or so and everything else in these missions will absolutely wreck you.\n\nREVIEW: ONLY buy this game IF you have enough to get a nice clan of friends and try and keep at the same level. Otherwises, everything will end up exceptionally grindy and over-powered.","November 29, 2015","true","29.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

I really like the weapon progression, here's an example\nshot-> big shot-> heavy shot-> massive shot. Also if you are going to buy this please do single player before multiplayer it will help immensely and when you finish a set of single player missions you get a pretty good shot. The leveling system is great too you have to make hard decisions, you can get the +1 upgrades and and a really good one at the end of the upgrade chain or branch off and get the +2+3+4+5.

Overall it's just as much fun, a bit of a grind to level up both your tank and weapons but I don’t mind it too much.\n\nThe game is constantly updated with new features every few days to keep it interesting and has received a surge of new players due to being featured on some popular YouTube channels. I recommend this game if you don’t mind that it takes a while to grind up in levels (to put it in perspective, I played 180 hours and I am level 88).\n\nMy only complaints would be the unbearably difficult single player missions that pretty much require you to be lucky or have upgraded weapons to beat (such as the piñata and boss levels). Also, the match default setting puts a difference in level of 20 in order to join. This is understandable as higher levels would have an advantage but it also makes players who have high levels not able to play in a lot of matches (for me it's around 6-8 games available out of 60-70). That diminishes some of the enjoyment once you reach a high level and can no longer join a lot of games. It would be better if the default setting was "all levels" for matchmaking but you could change it if you didn't want to play stronger opponents so that there isn't as much of a downside to ranking up.\n\nOverall I'd say this is a 7/10","March 2","true","254.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Thriving from an active community. With constant updates, this game is so far doing good by itself. It's at the moment very early access. So it's a tad empty, but there's many plans for this game that will take it far!\n\nPositives:\n-Much more fluid than ShellShock Live 2\n-New systems\n-Large graphic improvements\n-New and improved sounds\n-Singleplayer Campaign, that adds quite the challenge to the game\n-No micro-transactions which took a large part away from ShellShock Live 2\n-New Customization options\n\nNegatives:\n-Tad buggy, but it's early access\n-Missing a few systems, but are planned to be added\n-It is a little empty, but it's not largely marketed yet\n-Leveling is a little slow, but again it's missing some of the XP multiplier systems\n\nI truly reccommend this game for anyone who loves a great community, loves to be competitive and have a ton of fun with friends.\n\nIf you haven't joined the community, you're missing a huge part of the fun.\nhttp://shellshockliveforums.com/","March 14, 2015","true","101.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

But with people who have many more awesome weapons fired from significantly better tanks, you quickly realise how little thought has gone into the actual game mechanics. Too many battles are also decided on starting position alone.\n\nWill stick with it but honestly can't recommend.","November 20, 2015","false","4.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

One issue I been having is the traction as it seems very weird in this version as of the game, in the free to play version of the game even if you do have a low traction level you were able to go down any hills that aren’t at a 90 degree angle but you were unable to go back up that same hill without a higher traction level, where in this version you cannot go up or down most hills without the proper traction level which gets frustrating at times when you find yourself stuck on top of a hill as you are basically a sitting duck until the hill is destroyed enough for you to escape from. The portal mechanic is a welcome new feature that gives a whole new meaning to trick shots as they often enable shots that are usually impossible, possible if you aim well which is always impressive to look at.\n\nThe single player mission mode are a nice and very welcome addition to the game that enables new players to the franchise to slowly learn the basics of the game without jumping straight into multiplayer games unprepared, but I feel the difficultly curb goes up by huge spikes every set if you plan to go through them all at once with plenty of missions relying on perfect aim on a single attempt to complete without the assistance of the angle and power meter. Personally I feel this can be improved on by giving players more than a single attempt or at least give some tracers to assist the player as it can get frustrating with the lengthy trick shot missions. On the flip side if you put the missions to the side and level up your weapons a bit you can completely trivialize the difficulty of a lot of the missions. There should be a form of weapon lock system that only allows you to use the tier of a weapon that was originally meant for the mission or later mission additions won’t pose much of a challenge.\n\nShell shock live currently offers two different weapon system to choose from, one of them is the classic randomized weapon system that veterans of the series have come to know and love and the second is a selectable tiered weapon system each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Leveling up your weapons has also changed drastically compared to SSL2, instead of leveling up a single weapon multiple times for more power with that shot you now level weapons to upgrade them to superior versions of the weapons. The game also offers tank upgrading system, each time you level up you get an upgrade point for your tank which you can spend on either improving your traction, adding armor to your tank, adding higher critical chance to your tank, or just increasing your luck with certain aspects of the game.\n\nCurrently the multiplayer needs a bit of work because as of right now there are only a small handful of game modes to choose from which can cause the game to get stale after a while playing each of the modes. Finding a game can also hard at times due to the low but slowly growing population of the game, this is especially true if your one of the higher leveled players as a majority of the lower leveled players will tend to avoid you for good reason. Overall though the multiplayer is very enjoyable to play though it could use a couple of new game modes to mix up gameplay.\n\nTraining used to be very sluggish, but recently the exp required to level up was greatly adjusted to take out a large portion of the grind required to see everything the game has to offer which makes the game much more accessible to the casual audience while at the same time giving those more hardcore players that want to go beyond the traditional max level of 80 to grind the 20 additional prestige levels that will require tons of time and effort to achieve the real max level of 100. Though right now you might want to hold yourself back on grinding those levels as currently unlocks behind those levels are in development so there is not much reward currently for achieving the real max level aside from maxing out your tank.\n\nThe achievements can also be improved upon, for the most part I love the achievement system and I hope to see it expanded upon but I feel right now some achievements requires unrealistic amount of time and effort to obtain to unlock lack luster rewards if compared to the work required to get them. Usually I have no problem with achievements that require a lot of work to get but I feel they should be achievements for achievements sake with no rewards behind them and the more doable achievements having unlocks behind them.\n\nGraphics and performance\n\nThe game looks very nice with all weapons and various effects having their own unique look and charm to them and also runs very smoothly on my computer, but I feel some weapons generate too much needless smoke sometimes. Another problem I have is the bloom, every shot and the background have a kind of bloom effect I feel is much too bright for comfort. Personally I feel there should be more options for adjusting certain graphical functions to optimize the game for computers that do not have the best specs because as of right now you don’t have many options and if you do not have the best pc to play this game with you will have no choice but to put up with the lag.\n\nCommunity\n\nThe community is a very competitive one, but with competition comes toxicity so expect drama both in game and on the official forums. For the most part you can ignore these people by simply muting them or staying as far away from the drama as humanly possible, but I feel there should be a way to blacklist players from your games as there will be many times where people cause a lot of trouble for you by either quitting midgame because things are not well going for them or being generally disruptive in your game to the point where it ruins others fun. You are able to kick them from your room but that does not stop them from simply rejoining the room and the process repeating itself until either you finally let that individual in or they get bored and go elsewhere.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nTo new players of the franchise I would recommend playing the free to play flash version of the game first to get an idea what to expect with this game before buying it so you don’t come in with high expectations. If you are a veteran of shellshock live 2 give the game a shot but be aware currently shell shock live does have less weapons to choose from currently compared to the flash version of the game which will slowly be fixed over time but still don’t expect a large amount of new stuff. With the games recent price cut to the cheap price of $6.99 and the overall improvement to the game, community and developer involvement with the community I am much more prepared to recommend others to try out the game then I was previously. There is still lots of work to be done, I feel the single player mode should be expanded on with options other than missions and the addition of a local multiplayer mode with everything unlocked to play from the start so you can just grab a friend and experience everything the game has to offer without buying the game a second time and putting in the work required but of course that does not carry over to your actual multiplayer profile. Kchamp keep up the good work with the games development and continue to interact with your community as much as you have been lately to ensure the quality of your game only continues to only up.","March 12, 2015","true","771.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

While there's obvious advantages to higher-leveled players (greater weapon selection, tank buffs, etc) the game is still strictly skill based and nailing cool shots is fun whether or not you win the round.  ShellShock Live is the kind of game you can pick up with your buddies and play one or fifty matches in an evening without so much as blinking.\n\nAs far as I can tell there is only one music track which, as epic as it is, gets annoying after the first five minutes--this is easily solved on my end by cutting the music off, but the inclusion of a few more audio tracks as the game approaches release would be a welcome asset.\n\n\nAdditionally, I would like to see the eventual incorporation of custom match modifiers / mutators where the host can select / ban certain weapons.  A Sniper only match, for instance, would be a heck of a lot of fun.\n\nI've enjoyed my experience with ShellShock Live so far, and the few technical issues I've had were quickly and professionally rectified by the devs (specifically kChamp, thanks!).  I think the current pricepoint is completely reasonable, assuming that the game will continue to evolve and update without incorporating any pay-to-win elements.  Like I said before, the game is currently in beta and I hope to see many additions in the future as this game approaches official release.","March 26, 2015","true","51.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

There is so much more stuff that you can do in this one that you'll be here for awhile. With lots of new weapons, game modes, and a singleplayer mission mode, this version is a lot better than it's previous version. Definitely worth the $7 for EVERYTHING versuses the ungodly amount you would have to pay in ssl2 to just to get everything.\n\nAs far as everybody else goes who have played games like Worms, you'll enjoy this game as well! You have lots of weapons, and fun modes to choose from where it isn't just to kill your opononet every single time.\n\nIf you are concerned about the Early Access tag that this game has, it's safe to say that the game is near completion and you can play it just fine. There are a few occasional bugs here and there that need to be fixed, but the dev has been on track and has been on top of these kinds of issues going full steam ahead. You just have to be patient, afterall the dev is only 1 person so things take a bit of time. Most of the things here though are community driven, and a lot of community feedback has shaped the game to what it is so if you want to help give your input now would be the perfect opportunity to do so.","April 8, 2015","true","491.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

Initially you only have access to around 30 different types of weapons (and their upgradeable trees). They are the more basic of all weapons, which really are not exceptionally powerful, but generally have good tactical ability, since most of them can be used in any situation if you can aim well.\n\nAs you gather experience points, which are accumulated as you play the game, you get access to newer weapons, which behave differently. Like the Dead Weight shot. Which once it reaches it's highest point in it's arc, will fall straight down.\n\nThe only real problems I have with the game is the level discrepancy between a person who has played for a year, and people who play new today is the fact that as you go up a level, you upgrade your tank. Certain trees directly improve the amount of damage output, this is usually offset if a person of the same level uses the defensive tree. The problem lies where when one person is maximum level, and the other is at a minimal level. The person with upgrades will have a significantly higher chance of defeating the lower level player. Partially due to having superior weapons, and partially due to getting boosts to the tank, such as higher starting HP, and higher critical ratios. However, it is easily possible to beat a "superior" player with base weapons. That and low level players now get a small XP boost for "playing out of their league".\n\nOther than the above statement the game is excellent. This is a game that deserves more attention, there are just enough players to get a few servers running, but usually never more than 3 8 man servers. Hopefully this review would bring attention to it. Apparently Twitch brought more attention to it, not it's hard to NOT find a game.\n\nAnother plus side, I just noticed. The game is being constantly improved. There are updates nearly every day, and the developers actively play the game to get feedback from players as the changes are made.\n\nI think it's definitely worth the 15 dollar price (it was when I got it, and still is now!)","March 29, 2015","true","99.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Maybe if the developers made it a free game with many weapon maps or map packs or even tank packs to get the money. That way more people will play the game and will ask their friends to play and then their friends will ask their friends to play and it will be a game widley played by everyone. If the developers was to make this a free game they should also give the people that payed for the game some sort of bonus like a cool weapon. Overall this game is so addicting and has a lot of potential however it is hard to get into the game when nobody plays it as this is the main selling point.","July 16, 2015","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The short one on the right).\n\nThe fact that you start off with a limited amount of weapons is great as it allows players to adapt to each one and feel more comfortable before moving onto a new weapon. While the game is still in early access, it's done extremely well during it's time as well as constantly getting updates for new content and bug fixes.\n\nMy only cons is that their official forum is crap. Bad attitude that basically doesn't permit any fun whatsoever. Don't bother with it. The other con is that cheating is still a problem and needs to be solved as soon as possible since many players are using it which deters players away from playing again.\n\nOut of 10, I give the game a solid 8/10 and my personal thumbs up (I know you can't tell if my thumb is pointing up but trust me, it is.)\n","May 26","true","242.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Its still the same principle. You set power and angle and click fire and chaoes ensues. This game adds a lot of single player missions, some of which are a ♥♥♥♥♥ to complete. With those you should be able to have a decent selection of weapons whithout ever having done a multiplayer match. The downside at this point (28.3.2015 shortly after release) is that there is barely anyone playing it. For example trying to fill an 8 player room is not something that is done easyly. This also means that there is a couple players that have advanced in level so far that they wreck you in a 1 vs 1. But oh well grind on and prepare your wrath. The biggest plusside btw: updates. There is a LOT of those coming out VERY frequently, so dont get put off by the "early access" description. Its also a full game really. It already has more content than ssl2. 15 Euros is still a lot though, so I reccomend hoping for a sale, mostly because thats also when a rush of new players will start playing this.\n\nUPDATE: Man they sure bring out a lotta updates. As of this moment (29.5.2015) there is 2 more gamemodes and from what I have seen there will be 6 in the end. There still isnt that many people playing but there is definately more. with the third game mode this game now officially has more content than shellshock 2 and is better in every way except that you lose the progress you made there. They introduced tank coin like thingys BUT you cant buy them and you can only get 4 different weapons with themso far and they appear randomly and all you gotta do is click on them. I would expect about 10 in a very long game. They also reduced the price, hows that for an update? The thumb up that I give gets bigger and bigger, buy a 4 pack and get your friends in this game.","March 28, 2015","true","151.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SMBplayer/recommended/326460/","SMBplayer","Nydall","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SMBplayer/","32 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nShellShock Live for Steam already feels more complete than the first 2 pay 2 win games. The singleplayer really seems like it's geared towards teaching you how the weapons work without explaining it, rather it lets you experiment around to see how each weapon works. Some of the missions are hard for the wrong reasons (Lookin' at you, Get Lucky.), but generally you're in for a good time.\n\nNow for the multiplayer aspect of the game (which let's face it, you'll probably get this for the multiplayer), it's about the same as ShellShock Live 1 and 2. You shoot other tanks until they die. There's no Points mode yet, but they make up for it in the currency called Gears. Gears are the equivalent of the Tank Coins in SSL 1 and 2. You get Gears when they pop out of tanks after they've been hit, and you mouse over them. Here's my only complaint so far: THE GEARS CAN OFFSCREEN THEMSELVES BEFORE YOU CAN REACT! If there's a tank to the very side of the screen, the gear will bounce offscreen and you won't be able to get it.\n\nNow, this game isn't Pay 2 win like SSL1 and SSL2, but rather it's based on how much you level up, making it somewhat of a meritocracy. I like that. The more you play, the more experience (both in-game and actual experience with the game) you get, the better weapons you get and the more Tank Points you get. Tank Points are your stats, of which you can improve 4: your gun (attack power), your luck, your armor (defense), and your mobility. Each of this has a different advantage in battle, and provides for very unique builds.\n\nI would recommend this to anybody who loves the idea of a 2D turn-based Tank MMO.","May 17, 2015","true","31.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Shields appear randomly but can cause huge unfairness, they should be removed or reworked. Spawns are just broken. There needs to be pre-determined spawn for every game type and any number of players because it is just ridiculous. The creator also needs to put in more effort into designing maps. Currently, they are all variances of the same map. We need something unique in every map!!\n\nIt's a fun game but can be very frustrating because of the unfairness sometimes. That is why this game is currently a 6.5 or 7/10.\n\nI'll probably spend hundreds of hours into this game but in short sessions because of how it is right now.\n\n\nThe devs need to also fix the Sundee ruler thing.

Those 40 levels are so easy that's like if the real levels were 60. After 47 hrs played, i reached level 64; the exp curve is not so fast but you can still earn 1-2 levels per day by playing moderately, so you get close to level 100 within a reasonable time. After 93 hrs played, i'm level 75; at this point i'm out of achievements (some of them are pointless), and yes, you have to farm to level up. However, be aware that's playable even if you are not level 100, or even better if you choose match settings in order to block low or high level players.\n\nAbout game modes (all modes support 2-8 players, except Tournament):\n- "Juggernaut" mode picks a player and sets him as Boss, so it's All-Players VS 1.\n- "Marksman" mode every player turn spawns a dartboard at random position; don't miss it, or lose.\n- "Points" mode is without death. You play for a limited number of turns, and you have to rack up more damage than your enemy.\n- "Rebound" mode spawns bumper surfaces at random position; all your skillshots must bounce on them first.\n- "Assassin" mode automatically marks a target: you have to destroy it.\n- "Deathmatch" mode... you know this classic; 1 VS 1, All VS All, or Team VS Team.\n- "Tournament" mode allows you to create a tournament for 4-16 players, but it's basically 1 VS 1, where the winner challenges the other winner.\n\nIn the past i played other games of the same genre, and i have to say that's pretty good, except the maps (every map looks like the others - there are no high floors, just a ground floor for all players), and the graphics... it's way too simple, with horrible phosphorescent colors, no terrain details, and even worse background, but i have to say that quality is appreciable as it's well polished in its simplicity.\n\nNOTE: NO MICROTRANSATIONS, the shop is usable just with the in-game currency called "Gear". You randomly drop gears by playing or by completing the daily quest, and you can use them to purchase extra weapons, maps, cosmetic parts for your tank, etc...","April 26","true","128.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

How about Gorrilla's from the old qbasic days?  This game is for you.  While it doesn't have the rts element of Zwei and Death Tanks and is Turn Based like the old school variety.  The weapon list and arsonal keeps things vastly different each match.\n\nWhile the main focus of this game is multi-player and definetly should be and the community is still small, so far the players are friendly from all my games.  You can level up and unlock more maps and weapons.  Your weapons upgrade from using them in matches whether you win or lose.  You can upgrade your tank stats as you level up your Tank/Rank.\n\nYou can even play 8 sets of single player missions I believe each set has 10 missions and can be Quite tricky.  I am only on the 4th set of the 8 myself and you gain experience, levels and weapons for it as well.  Achievements unlock more maps and weapons for an added extra incentive but never really feels like you drowning under the higher ranked/leveled players.","March 28, 2015","true","11.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

This is, word-for-word, what I wrote:\n\n"DLC!? Doesn't that make it more like pay-to-win before? More content which can't be unlocked by every user who just gets the game is pretty much that. Also, what DLC is reasonable? There pretty much is no soundtrack. 11 tracks or so totaling under 10 minutes (probably 8 or 9 minutes max) is unrealistic. He hasn't even finished adding weapons into the real game. Heck, we aren't even out of the dreaded early access stage yet. We're not even sure if he's ever actually going to release it with CropDuster Supreme in the way and somewhat less devotion to updates. Skins and other accessories like that should be added into the real game, not added as DLC. Other games have DLC which I disagree with (like Rocket League and FNAF), but those are actually high quality games (not so much for every FNAF game imo, but whatever). This game is not up to that standard. I mean, the damage system isn't perfect, and will probably be rebunked in the future. There are still bugs coming in, and it's been almost a year at this point. The new menu is complete trash, as more than half of my tiny monitor is just empty space. I can hardly read any chat messages or anything without my glasses at this point, and my eyesight hasn't retrogressed. Besides, DLC adds MORE price to the game. It's still absurdly high for what's there. Why would you make any DLC which would push this game over $8?\n\nAlso, doesn't it just show we're giving up on him, but we're finding new hope in a new way which isn't beneficial at all to us? This is stuff which should be part of his updates, which do not assist the game much. We have given up on these updates, as we pretty much should at this point, but we are doing the wrong thing. We're begging for DLC to help this game out, which a) makes this even more like a money pit and b) just poops on everything kChamp said in the past. It's getting closer to the time to bail on this game. Rather than pay for cool DLC which should be in normal gameplay, let's do a more rational option: leave. If this game isn't giving you what you want, go back to SSL2 or find a better game to meet your needs. If this game is the Titanic, it has already hit the iceburg and has 80% of itself under water. Due to the situation, this game is unfixable, and will remain unfixable kChamp starts listening to the community and actually makes a decent attempt to fix the gameplay issues. Seriously, it's almost better to find a new game. "\n\nI apoligize it has some DLC-based stuff, but there is more reasons not to by the game than the DLC content.\n\nIn addition, I think the community is an issue. We've pretty much been sitting back, letting kChamp control this ship once again with the same results. We aren't listened to, but that doesn't mean we should sit back. Someone who is more dedicated to pulling off a magical comeback should constantly email him, telling him to check the forums every day. He won't do it otherwise. You can't talk to him on the forums and ask him anything because he rarely checks. This game will never leave early access.\n\nNow, why am I not saving this game if I have the advice? I have tried for the 10 months to follow it, but none of it works. I sent him an email for three weeks straight to get him back on the forums before giving up. He didn't ever come on during that span. I've been here in this community a long time (September would be Year #3 in the game, July would be Year #2 on the forums). I've seen a lot happen to SSL2, and I've seen everything that has happened with this game. What has happened to this game is tragic. I'm to the point where I will never recommend it. Yes, I've been in red for 6 months now, but he can't save the game now. It's too late. Save your $7 and go get a game which you'll actually enjoy and is out of early access unless you actually want to help with bugs. Please. Don't get caught up in this web of frustration like we have.\n\nAnd don't get CropDuster Supreme, either. It's been Greenlit, and watching this trailer when somewhat sick literally made be vomit my guts out. Check out its Greenlit page if you don't believe me. This game is a GODSEND compared to that piece of crap (literally: it's all based on farting).

It has enough to keep you trying to reach a higher level for new weapons and power ups.\nThe single player missions are nice, some offering a fair challenge and even occasionally cause some dickripping to occur.\n\n\n\nI haven't encountered any bugs and haven't heard of any gamebreaking ones either, so far.\n\nPRO's:\n\nOnline Multiplayer AND Singleplayer puzzles\nFree For All, Team-based (Everyone shoots at once, team shoots at once, each player shoots on his/her turn)\nVery polished (Kchamp has considerable experience, this being his third installment of the game)\nCLANS for the competetively minded people out there\nEasy to pick up and very casual. Great for a quick 15 minutes of fun!\nTrickshots with portals and shields ;D\nPlottwists, so many plottwists .. Turned a lost game around by hitting a 2X buff with a snipershot and have it critically hit on target after bouncing on a shield.\nI feel the price is right.\nChat function in game lobbies and game itself, but no toxicity.\n\n° New features are being added frequently °\n\nCON's:\n\nGame is in Early Acces, so everything stated and mentioned, including personal opinions, are prone to change\nDue to Early Acces there is some waiting time for filling a multiplayer lobby, but this is barely an issue.\nIt's hard to think of any other cons, the game is really polished.\n\nCONCLUSION: If you are a big fan of the last 2 games, don't hesitate to pick this one up! It's worth it!\nMaybe even convince some friends to come and play together :D Or make some new ones like me.\n\n- - X","April 7, 2015","true","17.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Also why isn't their randomly generated levels? and a full random option for wind speed?\nAlso would be nice to turn off or on all of the features.\n\nAlso being a lower level is a dissadavanted when your enemy can spawn with much higher damage dealing weapons.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bitch-baby/recommended/326460/","bitch-baby","Silver Lining","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bitch-baby/","244 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAt a play-time of almost 2 hours (level 11 I believe), I've barely scratched the surface of this game, but one thing is for sure: I CAN'T stop thinking about the damn thing. The thrill of battle, the satisfaction of the progression, and the god-like feeling of landing a perfect snipe is addictive and so ♥♥♥♥ing worth it.  This is the definition of BANG for your buck.\n\nIn all seriousness:\n\nThis game consists of a single player with a set of 80+ missions that act as a tutorial and challenges, and a multiplayer mode against AI (but no xp gain) and human players. While the singleplayer is a nice way to hone your skill, the meat of the game is clearly in multiplayer.\n\nThere are quite a few multiplayer modes, but the most popular seems to be deathmatch, though I feel like the Assassination mode could be interesting as well. Players vary in skill level, which affects how many types of guns are available to them, and might affect their passive tank bonus. If you want to steer clear of the disadvantage of playing against high level players, you can either host your own lobby with a low rank difference, or seek out lobbies with similarly ranked players. You gain xp and level up regardless pf whether you win or lose (though more xp goes to the winner of course). I haven't had any problems with the multiplayer so far.\n\nThe game has a very satisfying sound and aesthetic. Guns appear in your roster with a flashy animation, and the presentation is very sleek overall. The only problem I have with the UI is the inability to click through the level-up or xp animations. These just take way too long, and I often have to click Ready while within the animation. This isn't hard, guys. Come on.\n\nCONCLUSION: Costs as much as a sub. Provides endless hours of entertainment. Grab it now if you're a Worms fan, grab it anyway even if you're not.","March 20","true","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Cool. But you probably want to know more.\n\nIn case you did not know, Shellshock Live (SSL) is a steam adaptation to 2 free-to-play browser games, reasonably titled Shellshock Live 1, and Shellshock Live 2. Shellshock Live 2 is the newer and more active browser game, but the steam version (the newest adaptation) of this franchise has many differences than SSL2.\n\nQ: if those browser games are free, why buy this game for $7?\n\nA: It's based off what you want. All the weapons are found in both games, but here's the kicker: for $7, you get ALL the weapons. With Shellshock Live 2, lots of those weapons (and other things, but weapons are the main point imo) are locked behind paywalls (you can get 8 weapons for >$7. There are 8 of these weapon packs, and 2 retro weapon packs (from SSL1) that are twice the size and cost more). However, with Shellshock live Steam, it takes lots of GRIINNDDDIINNNGGGGG to get these weapons and upgrade certain weapons. (Im level 58/100 as of this review and i still dont have big shot) Thus, it's if you want to pay, or grind. If you pick SSL2, you chose pay. If you pick SSLS, you chose grind.\nNow that that's out of the way, here are pros and cons for this game compared to SSL2.\n\nPROS:\n\n-No IAP (In-game-purchases)\n-8 Player Battles (if you can get one going)\n-Graphics! Graphics! Graphics!\n-Early Access game...new features are being added more often.\n-Clans\n-Single Player mode (80 missions useful for newbies)\n-NO IAP!!!!!@#$*!@*#%!@#*$%^&!#$TRQ@#111111 (sry)\n\nCONS:\n\n-Active people pale in comparison to SSL2\n-The game isn't gaining many players currently\n-S00 grindy\n-Has weapon balancing issues (may be fixed, but we must wait.....)\n\nAll in all, this game is arguably in improvement on the flash version. I, myself, am really against In-game-purchases and find this to be a MUCH better value. However, it is much harder to create games than SSL2 due to the lack of people playing this game. For the price tag of $7, though, i find it to be well worth it. Plus, you're helping the community grow, right? :)","April 17, 2015","true","235.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iBmassic/recommended/326460/","iBmassic","Massic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iBmassic/","148 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIf you are a multiplayer-centric gamer, by all means give this game a try. I had hoped that it would replicate the frenzy and explosive insanity of "Scorched Earth" from 1991 and for the most part it does.\n\nBeing unable to progress your "character" in strictly offline matches against the AI means that you are unable to experience the full range of customization and weapon options. There have been multiple requests for this feature since the game was in early access. This and the lack of local co-op when similar reboots of old franchises (such as Road Redemption) have included it suggests to me that the developers are more interested in unit sales than the experience.\n\nIt's not bad by any means, but I am not going to give it my recommendation either.\n\n\n<edit> : According to the Store page, the original length of time that SSL was planned to be in early access was 3-4 months. Writing this 12 months after the initial release, with development on SSL2 seemingly well underway, would suggest that this game also be placed in the growing list of cash farming perpetual early access cash cows.

WHERE'S THE TURTLES?! I guess they look like them because they're green...\n\n\nAnywho, welcome to ShellShock Live where you were once a worm and now you turn into a tank for the ultimate free for all. But no seriously, this game reminds of Worms Revolution because it has a similar playstyle. If you like blowing stuff up, big explosions, AND TANKS then buy this game. For the considerably low price of 6 bucks you can diminsh other tanks into Oblivion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was at 18 hp.\nDan had 178 hp.\nWe're both at other sides of the map.\nI wonder, "Hmm maybe if I land this air strike I could win..."\nI shoot the airstrike,\nit goes across the map and then Dan's shot gets in the way.\nIt bounces back.\nThe air strike commences and I die,\n10/10 would Airstrike myself when directly shooting at my friends.","November 21, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"

You might want to stick to the Worms franchise. Worms is more fun, more clever, and less repetitive. This isn't a bad game, but it takes forever to unlock anything so most players will never get to see a lot of the possible content unless it is used against them by somebody with no job and no responsibilities. This should really be on mobile... oh wait... Armored Strike is on mobile, and that has Nukes. How do you not have nukes Shellshock? Why can I not buy sheilds, or move more than 2 feet. Why does the quickjoin button constantly connect me to games I can't join just to make me go back to the main menu. Uhg. I feel like they want me to Pay to Win, but that's not an option. Soooo why does every upgrade take so long. I would have to play this everyday for months to unlock anything.\n\nI got it cheap!","February 9","false","5.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I first got it becasue I use to play a game very similar called tanks, and this is way more complete and fun. It has a lot of levels, there is no microtransactions that I have discovered, amd there is a lot of weapons and upgrades for your tank.

Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.","April 6","true","48.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","0"

Firstly you control your tank instead of thinking about your moves for multiple annoying worms, which means more enjoyable combat. I was amazed to see the range of artillery which you unlock over the course of playing the game, from "Shot" to "Portal Gun" it's insane, plus the fact your usage of the artillary levels it up, increasing the damage or effect it has. The game also Includes many, many maps in which I've only unlocked a couple. There is very nice leveling system in which each level you progress a new artillery is unlocked, I also like the simplistic map design where it's more focused on the fact of hitting your target than the overloaded image pasted over any new Worms map. The menu's and general aesthetic of the game is really nice to look at, with its simplistic background with really nice animations for level ups and unlocks, I can't think of any note worthy faults. Overall this is an amazing game especially for the price, If you enjoy 2D shooters, tank games or even Worms, this game is perfect.","April 11","true","15.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Basically I'm not sure where they are going with it. I'm worried it's either going to sell us in-game goods or slow f2p will stay. If it was x2 faster to progress it would be much better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThisGibusConfusinYeah/recommended/326460/","ThisGibusConfusinYeah","Only a Cookie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThisGibusConfusinYeah/","11 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game reminds me heavily of those Tank Games I played when I was younger. You were a effectively immobile tank, took aim at a rival tank, shot and hoped it hit. If it didn't, the enemy repeated the action of trying to hit your tank before you hit them more.\n\nThis expands on those principles- There are Jetpacks, Shield and random map effects. Flashy weapons and such, too. It's pretty too! I like the simplistic artstyle. However, I disagree with the more "grindy" aspects of the game. Progression is SLOW. One weapon per level sounds good, right? Frankly, it takes an age to level up (I had it easy for myself, reaching level 6- used a grinding server. As your level gets higher the grind gets worse.), and I get a kill each round. There are also upgrades, that are bought by assigning levels to them. The categories are basically- luck, guns, armor and mobility. I like myself a good skill tree, but in the grand scheme of things I like everyone at a fair playing field. While it is possible to defeat someone stronger than you level wise, the weapons unlocked and upgraded give them greater flexibilty  and firepower.  While one may argue that these upgrades may not be too powerful- the Armor tree gives a single point of armor per level, and the Mobility tree gives a bit more fuel, these do stack up to be important- starting with 20 points more armor is a big deal.\n\nI suppose one could argue that I am a impatient person, and that is a true thing. The other thing that annoys me is the Mac OS version. Being the one person who has a Mac in a sea of Windows users, I understand that developing for the minority isn't really a priority. It does exist, but there are frequent startup crashes that lead to an eventual refund. When it worked, it was pretty good.\n\nFInal Conclusion:\n+The game is fun.\n+A solid expansion to the tank games I once played.\n-Grinding needed to unlock new weapons and level them up\n-Seriously, lots of grinding.\n-A non equal playing field.\n-Crashes on startup, or at least for me.\n-200 weapons? More like 15 at the start.\n\nNot recommended personally, though I'm sure you can enjoy it if you can ignore the weapons.\n\n","February 18","false","1.3"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","0"

Very similar to Worms, I liked the previous flash-based editions of SSL. The first two games are really classics.\n\nPROS:\n+Plenty of new weapons that can be leveled up\n+Many maps that can be unlocked\n+Customization of tanks (albeit through unlocks when you level up)\n+Fun gameplay\n+Good music\n\nCONS:\n-No offline skirmish mode\n-Not enough players online\n\nDespite these two cons I can think of it's whats holding me back from Recommending it. The single player has missions, and that's fun and all, but the lack of a skirmish mode to practice offline is really disappointing. Also the lobby feels empty most of the time and you'll be waiting a while to jump into a game with other players.\n\nMost of the time the only way you'll be able to play multiplayer is through 1 on 1 matches which most of the time is unfair due to usually being matched against a very very high level player. They simply have more weapons, and more upgrades to make it less about skill involved and more about how much they have grinded to get there.\n\nYou can level up through the singleplayer but even when you beat all the missions your level will still not be enough.\n","June 2, 2015","false","10.1"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","1"

The game is completely redone in Unity and has 0 Paygates (As of the time of this Review 2/28/2016) unlike it's browser counterpart.\n\nThe game is pretty much your average 2D tank game, with the small exception of the XP system and the way you get new weapons. The weapons are gain by Leveling up, and you Upgrade said weapons by using them in battle, however you only increase the weapons XP if they deal damage, making some weapons Such as Moon Extremely Difficult to Level up.\nThere is also a Tank Level up system where you get a Token every level and you use said token to Upgrade your tank in the field you so desire (Gun, Movement, Luck, Chassis) Each of these Upgrades feel impactful with the exception of Luck, which i have seen no adverse effect of, and focusing on one Tree conversely makes it feel extremely Powerful, Such as gun and it's Crit Mechanic.","February 28","true","14.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Whether it’s the nameless NPCs you always meet in RPGs or the hundreds of mooks you mow down with gunfire in games like Uncharted, Undertale brilliantly demystifies these conventions and questions why games are still codified this way. But even outside of its ambitious themes, it proves to be a compact, perfectly paced RPG experience with hilarious, tense writing and endearing characters. That it succeeds so completely in its thematic approach on top of all that is what makes Undertale a truly essential experience.","March 9","true","4.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

What you see in the trailer is pretty much what you get. I've only played TDM and FFA so far (not counting the single player levels which I will talk about in a minute), and those play like that of or similar to a turn-based battle game. In FFA, all players (2-8 I believe) can choose to move, albeit only a few feet because if you could move anywhere that'd be too OP, and then choose what weapon you want to fire with and set the trajectory for the weapon to follow. Once everyone has done this and clicks the fire button, all the players will fire at once and if your guesstimate was good enough, you will hit your target and do some damage.\nTDM is a little different in the fact that it's more turn-based styled and every player gets to shoot separately.\nThere are other modes but I haven't played them yet so I will not review/go over them.\nBefore I go onto the Single Player part, one more thing I will mention about the multiplayer for this part is that you can play with random people OR with any friends that you have in your friends list, which is awesome. Me and my two brothers have already played a few matches together and it's a BLAST. Get it? Blast...\n\nThere aren't always a lot of rooms open to play with/against other players and those that are open can be players that are much higher level that you so you wouldn't want to play anyway. For those situations there is the Single Player missions. There are currently 8 sets, each set has 10 missions I believe. As you'd expect, the beginning missions are easy, and comprise of easy tasks like shooting a target or destroying a couple of lower leveled CPU tanks. As you progress through the sets, the missions become harder. Like you have to preform trick shots with very limited ammo. It can become very frustrating but for those of you who like a challenge, this is great.\n\nOne more thing I will mention, as a pro, is the amount of weapons. There are TONS, each one unique and can be upgraded, 1 to 3 times, through use (it takes awhile). The charm isn't in the graphics or the tanks, it's definitely in the weapons. You can shoot cat bombs, summon lightning to strike your enemies, hell, even freakin guppies are a weapon in this game.\n\nAre there any cons? Well, imo the game should be 5 bucks max as it looks and feels like something that could be played as a flash game online. (I remember playing something like this on the Lego Hero-ica website several years ago when I was younger hehe. Though it was only single player, it was a lot prettier...) It IS only 5 bucks now but only for a few days as a post this. Also, while there might always be some players online, there's definitely not always many. That being said, while it isn't a good thing that shouldn't stop you from playing. Because if everyone did that, no games would ever grow.\n\nSo, should you get it? It's really hard to say. Imo the game is a lot more fun when you play against other people, especially if they're friends. If you know anyone who has this or you have friends who are going to pick this up, I'd recommend doing it too.\n\n(Sorry if my review isn't that great, it's not something I do very much :P)","November 28, 2015","true","128.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Many years later and this will provide that competitive, fun that's lacks in games these days which this game excels in.\n\nThe amount of weapons is mind boggling that you have at your disposal, to the point that your thinking "this is too much" but then in these type of games, more is certainly better and just adds to the fun you'll get from it especially if you play with friends.\n\nI've only played 30min - 1 hour at the time of writing this review but you instantly know if a game is excellent and something you'll go back to (think Rocket league) it's one of those addictive games that will give you hours of gameplay and enjoyment. And potentially rage at. :D\n\nFor the price of this game £4.99 (for me in the UK) this is an absolute bargain and you get your money's worth and then some.","February 25","true","99.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've enjoyed every single one thus far, but did eventually get bored of them.\n\nThis game, however, seems to perfect the long line.  This game has very nice and clean graphics while still being able to run on pretty much every system, it has enough weapon variations to keep one entertained, a sytem to keep players coming, and excellent customization in every area of the game.\n\nThe game customization and level system are what surprised me the most.  When a player sets up a game, they are able to choose the amount of players, map, game mode (which there are a surprising amount of), health, and other various items.  Then, as one plays the game, they see that they get experience.  Players level up as they play, which not only unlocks new weapons and maps, but allso allows allows the player to upgrade and customize their tank.  A player's tank can be customized to their liking, specializing in four different categories which boost different areas of their vehicle.  This feature pleasantly surprised me the most, and is exactly what keeps players coming back.  Even the weapons a players use upgrade as they use them.  The progression system adds so much to the game, and is a key feature.\n\nThe in-game chat system is excellent as well, with text bubbles of what a player says appearing above a tank, which can make for some funny conversations.\n\nWhen I first saw the video before I bought the 4-pack I was worried that there would be a weapon or destruction overload.  It appearned that the game would be over in two or three turns with such destructive power, but it turns out that is not the case.  The weapons do get strong, but not game breaking especially due to the option to raise the amount of health that the players can have, which goes up to six times the standard.\n\nOverall, this game is much more than I expected, with a good price tag, and lots of content to keep one entertained.  Playing with friends is an absolute must, and even when one can't play with them they can go single player or campaign.  The game feels almost complete and is still developing, and would recommend it to anyone, especially if they have friends to lpay with and/or they enjoyed the Worms series.","February 15","true","50.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It entertains you for a pretty decent amount of time with the overload of explosions; but there may be a few annoying issues.\n\nDue to the small player base, it's inevitable to be matched up with players that are 30-70 levels higher than you. Even if they have the most experience, these high level tanks get perks such as high armour, damage and other nuclear weapons.\n\nThe obstacles/buffs are too random. This destroys the skill part in a strategy game like Shellshock Live. For instance, x2 damage buffs sometimes favors one side and obstacles that deflect projectiles mostly block lucky players from getting damage.\n\nBuy the game if you don't mind RNG and unfair battles.","March 17","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot of thing must've changed, since most of those complaints seems not to apply anymore.\n\n-The game is NOT multiplayer only. There are a LOT of single player missions/challenges that allow you to level up very fast, and unlock stuff quickly. You can also practice versus bots if you wish. I got to level 16 by playing an hour of SP, then trying out MP for the next hour. That got me enough weapons to have a very nice varriety in my loudout, and a couple of tank upgrade points for some minor bonuses.\n-The progression system doesn't feel like it's making you so overpowered you can't live without it,  and there are also a lot of ways to make it less relevant. Sure, you won't ever win vs a lv 60 guy with your 5 level tank, but you'd probably lose anyway since he'd be way better as well. I got no problem playing vs level 20,30 players with my 15 level account, I still had tons of fun, and didn't feel like i'm at a disadvantage. Plus there are game modes that eliminate the disadventage of not having that many weapons unlocked (random weapon each turn),  or not being high level (FFA- pure chaos and fun).\n-There is a decent number of people playing the game, I was able to find people on my level (+-5) in less than a minute, sometimes I even got into a very good lobby instantly, thanks to quick join function.\n-This is not supposed to be played as a 1v1 game. If that's what you're after, forget about it. it's way too much random for a 1v1 game: you can get worse weapons, you can get worse starting position, you can get blocked by some random shield spawn on your trun etc. This is a game about diving into 3v3, 4v4 or FFA games and having a total blast blowing stuff up!\n\n\nMy advice: play some single player missions first, get the understanding of how shooting and weapons work, get some levels that way, and then jump into MP. I guarantee you'll have a whale of a time that way!","March 18","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That being said it's a great start and it's in early access, but it needs more work done on the technical mechanisms with multiplayer mode. If I'm playing a game with someone and I've selected ready and for some reason the player is not in the lobby after that and the lobby rules had been setup by that person for "friends only" I should no longer be in ready status, for any changes. Had lost rank points from quitting a game that started on me from someone online joining the lobby. Going to recommend because this game is the next best thing.

I've enjoyed every single one thus far, but did eventually get bored of them.\n\nThis game, however, seems to perfect the long line.  This game has very nice and clean graphics while still being able to run on pretty much every system, it has enough weapon variations to keep one entertained, a sytem to keep players coming, and excellent customization in every area of the game.\n\nThe game customization and level system are what surprised me the most.  When a player sets up a game, they are able to choose the amount of players, map, game mode (which there are a surprising amount of), health, and other various items.  Then, as one plays the game, they see that they get experience.  Players level up as they play, which not only unlocks new weapons and maps, but allso allows allows the player to upgrade and customize their tank.  A player's tank can be customized to their liking, specializing in four different categories which boost different areas of their vehicle.  This feature pleasantly surprised me the most, and is exactly what keeps players coming back.  Even the weapons a players use upgrade as they use them.  The progression system adds so much to the game, and is a key feature.\n\nThe in-game chat system is excellent as well, with text bubbles of what a player says appearing above a tank, which can make for some funny conversations.\n\nWhen I first saw the video before I bought the 4-pack I was worried that there would be a weapon or destruction overload.  It appearned that the game would be over in two or three turns with such destructive power, but it turns out that is not the case.  The weapons do get strong, but not game breaking especially due to the option to raise the amount of health that the players can have, which goes up to six times the standard.\n\nOverall, this game is much more than I expected, with a good price tag, and lots of content to keep one entertained.  Playing with friends is an absolute must, and even when one can't play with them they can go single player or campaign.  The game feels almost complete and is still developing, and would recommend it to anyone, especially if they have friends to lpay with and/or they enjoyed the Worms series.","February 15","true","50.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was fun then, especially with the mechanics and you having to figure out yourself how you're going to hit the enemy with what amount of power.\nNow, there's ShellShock Live.  I love it!  It brings back the feeling of that game, but with SO MUCH MORE!  Over 200 weapons to choose from, so many different maps, and so much customization and upgrade options.  This game is a true successor to the legacy of the in-browser game Tanks!\nI love all the different weapons you get to choose from...and I think my favorite one is the Cat.  Meow!\nHonestly, there's not much about this game that I cannot say anything bad about.  The spawning of the deflector rings and the deflector barriers is a little wonky sometimes, but that's easily overlooked with the simple fact that you're having quite a bit of fun trying to figure out the right tragectory of your shot while also figuring out either how to avoid the deflectors, or use them to your advantage.\nAnd it's thanks to a certain favorite YouTuber of mine that I even found this game.  Were it not for them, I would have never found this beautiful nostalgic gem of a game.\nMan, kChamp Games did a brilliant job recreating a childhood favorite of mine.

If teammates spawn close together and go second, the other team can just seal the game by bombarding the place the teammates spawned together, making them unable to move because the ground is uneven.\n\nThe daily bonus has one flaw and that is "No reward" zone. I think game should always reward for your daily with atleast minimum rewards. Look at Hearthstone, the lowest reward you can get from pack is one rare card and the rest common, it would be little sad to open pack with no reward. And I'm fine with getting the lowest reward rather than getting no reward after all I did to get that daily bonus.\n\nWhen I invited my friends to play with me they were not happy about that the weapons didn't explain what they do and I understand them completely. My level is somewhere in the 30's and I was using Quicksand for the first time, hit my target but did no damage so I have no idea how the weapon Quicksand works. Maybe I'll never touch it again and think it is just bad or try figuring it out someday.\n\nBut overall the game is good, the arsenal is huge and you always stumble on some new weapons to use.

Even if you are highly skilled and can hit 90% of your shots, it does not mean you'll win or even necessarily do well in any particular match.\n\nThere are weapons which require 100% accuracy and do terrible damage, while there are AoE weapons that you can miss by a large margin and still end up doing significant damage to the opponent. Then there are those weapons which can do as little as 5 damage, or as much as 150 - depending on how the weapon feels like behaving (Area Strike, and Snake to name two).\n\nThen there's crits. Why are crits in a "skill" based artillery game? I have no idea. It just adds another layer of RNG to the mix which makes things unsatisfying. There's nothing like outskilling an opponent for 5 minutes, only to have him land a lucky crit or two and completely take your off the map. Factor in the random 2x Damage buffs you can get in battle, and this problem becomes significantly worse (I've seen people do 100 damage with a 2x Damage crit, using weapons that don't require any aim whatsoever. I.e Deadweight)\n\nThe large selection of weapons is cool, but half of them are very gimmicky and some just down-right underperform. Many of the weapons you start with and unlock by level 10 are the most practical.\n\nWhich brings me to the leveling system. Why. Why is this here in a tank game? It's bad enough that everything is so random, that you have to go ahead and add a grind to it? What's even more funny, is that considering your weapon selection is random, the more weapons you unlock the worse your chances become of getting the GOOD weapons. Once you reach level 40+, your inventory is going to be filled with garbage on the regular.\n\nI've seen level 50s lose to level 2s because the level 50s got nothing but GARBAGE weapons the entire match, while the level 2s were repeatedly given high damage easy shots (Sinkhole, Airstrike, Sniper) because their overall selection is so much more limited.\n\nThe game overall is okay for a match here and there, as there can be some funny moments, but if you're looking for a game you actually want to get good at and invest time in, you should look somewhere else.","March 13","false","33.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot of thing must've changed, since most of those complaints seems not to apply anymore.\n\n-The game is NOT multiplayer only. There are a LOT of single player missions/challenges that allow you to level up very fast, and unlock stuff quickly. You can also practice versus bots if you wish. I got to level 16 by playing an hour of SP, then trying out MP for the next hour. That got me enough weapons to have a very nice varriety in my loudout, and a couple of tank upgrade points for some minor bonuses.\n-The progression system doesn't feel like it's making you so overpowered you can't live without it,  and there are also a lot of ways to make it less relevant. Sure, you won't ever win vs a lv 60 guy with your 5 level tank, but you'd probably lose anyway since he'd be way better as well. I got no problem playing vs level 20,30 players with my 15 level account, I still had tons of fun, and didn't feel like i'm at a disadvantage. Plus there are game modes that eliminate the disadventage of not having that many weapons unlocked (random weapon each turn),  or not being high level (FFA- pure chaos and fun).\n-There is a decent number of people playing the game, I was able to find people on my level (+-5) in less than a minute, sometimes I even got into a very good lobby instantly, thanks to quick join function.\n-This is not supposed to be played as a 1v1 game. If that's what you're after, forget about it. it's way too much random for a 1v1 game: you can get worse weapons, you can get worse starting position, you can get blocked by some random shield spawn on your trun etc. This is a game about diving into 3v3, 4v4 or FFA games and having a total blast blowing stuff up!\n\n\nMy advice: play some single player missions first, get the understanding of how shooting and weapons work, get some levels that way, and then jump into MP. I guarantee you'll have a whale of a time that way!","March 18","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If teammates spawn close together and go second, the other team can just seal the game by bombarding the place the teammates spawned together, making them unable to move because the ground is uneven.\n\nThe daily bonus has one flaw and that is "No reward" zone. I think game should always reward for your daily with atleast minimum rewards. Look at Hearthstone, the lowest reward you can get from pack is one rare card and the rest common, it would be little sad to open pack with no reward. And I'm fine with getting the lowest reward rather than getting no reward after all I did to get that daily bonus.\n\nWhen I invited my friends to play with me they were not happy about that the weapons didn't explain what they do and I understand them completely. My level is somewhere in the 30's and I was using Quicksand for the first time, hit my target but did no damage so I have no idea how the weapon Quicksand works. Maybe I'll never touch it again and think it is just bad or try figuring it out someday.\n\nBut overall the game is good, the arsenal is huge and you always stumble on some new weapons to use. Need to kill some hour or two, great game for that. Great to chill with and play with friends.

Even when you lose you get XP and feel that you "progress" and become stronger.\n\nThe autobalance in matchmaking seems to be solely based on Rating, not Account level, but Account level is a much more significant predictor for the strength of a player. Higher level = more Armor, more criticals, more movement, MUCH better weapons. If you have a high rating as a low level player you will not have fun in 4v4 matches and when you have a low rating with a high level you will freewin 4v4 games.\n\nThe aftergame screen is very lackluster, all the interesting information (total damage done, Damage per turn, turns survived, maybe MVP, most successful weapon/hit) are non-existant though very easy to implement.

You can have large scale battles or simple 1v1's.\n\nCons: Some people like to use a ruler to get easy hits on you or others which makes the game unfair (it's kinda like aimbotting in an FPS game).\n\nFun Fact: I've been accused of using a ruler at least 4 times in the 9 hours I've played this... Even though it's kinda easy to hit someone the same time if they sit in the same spot all match and you finally find the sweet spot to hit them.\n\nIs the game worth the money?

Also, as my friend pointed out to me, this is literally just Pocket Tanks. Another thing is as many have mentioned, Multiplayer IS unbalanced as hell, trust me. Now an arguement to that would be that "You can always play the Campaign!" The campaign is dreadfully boring, in-fact I decided to do the boss of the first misssions provided and I beat it easily by simply MOVING, since he only shot in one area. My final problems with it are the fact that getting anything with "Gold Gears" would take forever, and the fact that this game is not at all like it advertised to be, all those trailer weapons that look amazing? Better level to 40.\n\n\nTLDR: Good game for people who don't mind grinding, but not a fun experience for new players.","March 10","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So, I bought this game not expecting much, thinking "Oh, it's on sale, whatever, I'll add another game to my library" and I was wrong. This game is fantastic, and still in early access, For a game that's seemingly really early to Steam, this already has a variety of features, game modes, tournaments, and plenty of weapons (250+). I suggest you get it and tell your friends about it, Play the campaign to get an edge above most everyone and follow the Mission Guide by supremesonicbrazil. You'll get to level 50 in 2-3 days and have many unique weapons from the campaign that you can't unlock through playing multiplayer games.

One thing i had a problem with when i got it was the hard leveling system, but they made it easier so you don't have to grind until around lv 40. lv 80 is about the highest execpt a few prestiges up to 100 which some rewards aren't visible so I don't even know whats in it but im guessing 80 is around where level doesnt matter anymore,\n\nI would give it a 9/10.

I've enjoyed every single one thus far, but did eventually get bored of them.\n\nThis game, however, seems to perfect the long line.  This game has very nice and clean graphics while still being able to run on pretty much every system, it has enough weapon variations to keep one entertained, a sytem to keep players coming, and excellent customization in every area of the game.\n\nThe game customization and level system are what surprised me the most.  When a player sets up a game, they are able to choose the amount of players, map, game mode (which there are a surprising amount of), health, and other various items.  Then, as one plays the game, they see that they get experience.  Players level up as they play, which not only unlocks new weapons and maps, but allso allows allows the player to upgrade and customize their tank.  A player's tank can be customized to their liking, specializing in four different categories which boost different areas of their vehicle.  This feature pleasantly surprised me the most, and is exactly what keeps players coming back.  Even the weapons a players use upgrade as they use them.  The progression system adds so much to the game, and is a key feature.\n\nThe in-game chat system is excellent as well, with text bubbles of what a player says appearing above a tank, which can make for some funny conversations.\n\nWhen I first saw the video before I bought the 4-pack I was worried that there would be a weapon or destruction overload.  It appearned that the game would be over in two or three turns with such destructive power, but it turns out that is not the case.  The weapons do get strong, but not game breaking especially due to the option to raise the amount of health that the players can have, which goes up to six times the standard.\n\nOverall, this game is much more than I expected, with a good price tag, and lots of content to keep one entertained.  Playing with friends is an absolute must, and even when one can't play with them they can go single player or campaign.  The game feels almost complete and is still developing, and would recommend it to anyone, especially if they have friends to lpay with and/or they enjoyed the Worms series.","February 15","true","50.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, as my friend pointed out to me, this is literally just Pocket Tanks. Another thing is as many have mentioned, Multiplayer IS unbalanced as hell, trust me. Now an arguement to that would be that "You can always play the Campaign!" The campaign is dreadfully boring, in-fact I decided to do the boss of the first misssions provided and I beat it easily by simply MOVING, since he only shot in one area. My final problems with it are the fact that getting anything with "Gold Gears" would take forever, and the fact that this game is not at all like it advertised to be, all those trailer weapons that look amazing?

YOU READING THIS BUY IT NOW. If your computer is $HAT DONT BUY IT  becuase it wont load and you dumb farts are going to put the graphics on ultra because you didnt go to school. Next this game is for pros and people who dont wine alot. First of all some guys use some thing called the Ssundee ruler a youtber name which makes their aim perfect but people with actual skill gets blamed for this I met a physics professor and he often get called for using a ruler heck i was kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and said it to him because he SNIPED me. But just wait they will patch it but people get better as the play and some just have a knack for it because I played  a game named wildones and I got so good at the game peole would often tell me I am a hacker en español. They game got taken down for no more development was going on but made ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ disney games stay up to this day. Ahh Playdom Smh. BUT BUY THE GAME AD DONT BE A WET BLANKET.

I don't think $6-8 is too expensive of a price for something as nice as this (and there is absolutely zero microtransactions as well). Everything in the game is earned through playing, literally tons of unique weapons that can be upgraded and your tank can be upgraded as well.\n\nThere have been recent popular reviews about people cheating IRL but its not like you have to play with them on the rare occasion you do bump into them, you can just kick them out of the lobby or turn on wind conditions to mess up their accuracy. (Personally I haven't run into enough "Cheaters" to say that its much of a problem, and I suspect that some of the supposed "cheaters" people have run into are actually just good at the game). Also I'm pretty sure the infinite loading screen has been addressed since I'm not having problems with it.","April 10","true","32.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
