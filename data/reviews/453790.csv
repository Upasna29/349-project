I have no idea what is going on with this game, but it definitely does not belong on Steam.\nHowever,\nIt's functional. And in this day and age on Steam, a game that actually works without breaking itself is a good start. There are quests you can partake in, combat is very much like a bullet-hell shooter if the bullets were able to not only collide into each other, but also remain on the map as movable objects, and you can level up, customise your "b!tch bullets" as they were, and fight weird ghost things on the world map.\nA horrific, functional mess that has no place on Steam.\nHere's some gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atmxewLfI8o","March 22","false","0.5"," 254 of 295 people (86%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","86","254","295","23","6"

The graphics are bad, the story is bad, gameplay is also pretty bad but still I enjoyed my time playing this.\n\nAs a brit I can relate to the jokes and songs found in the game that are all very tongue in cheek. I feel a lot of this humour would be totally lost on other nationalities so if you aren’t British or in some way very knowledgeable of British culture this may be a total no no especially when it comes to the games soundtrack.\n\nAlong the way you gain items, fight bosses and go through a number of different worlds and levels in an ultra-light action RPG game. The game is bad… in most ways but (and you are probably going to just have to take my word on this) it is oddly fun to play and I found myself continuing even though my usual common sense indicator told me the game wasn’t any good.\n\nAt £3.99 or your regional equivalent there are better games out there but for the price of a pint in London, a magazine or a coffee you will find a gag game that will make you chuckle and offer at least something.\n\nThis game really isn’t for everyone and most will probably not “get it” but Candice DeBébé's Incredibly Trick Lifestyle is a massive tongue in cheek game that for those of you who will get the references is a giggle worth undertaking.\n\nTHIS GAME WAS OBTAINED VIA A KEY FROM THE DEVELOPER. MY OPINIONS ARE HOWEVER 100% MY OWN AND THE PRICE TO THE CONSUMER HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN PRODUCING THIS REVIEW.\n\nPlease check our our video review where this text review was taken from:  Video Review[www.thegametutor.co.uk]","April 5","true","4.1"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","30","41","0","0"

There are scenes where the aforementioned Derby man plays four different female characters and in effect is having a conversation with himself in varying degrees of falsetto. There is a serious risk that you may lose your sanity as a result of exposure to this. I was able to survive by punching myself in the testes until I passed out but it was a close call.\n\nThe explosive final entry in the acclaimed Candice DeBébé trilogy didn't disappoint, except on one count. As a diehard fan of the series, I am enraged that the continuity of the series has been rebooted. After Candice triumphantly battled to obtain a council house she has now inexplicably found herself in a trailer park, which I can only attribute to attempting to break the American market. At what cost, havishamone games? For shame. Spit in the faces of your most loyal fans and casually widdle all over the legacy of Candice DeBébé why don't you? This is just like the Mass Effect 3 ending all over again.\n\nA word on the soundtrack - an OST, no less! Every area has been thematically designed with a real intricacy and as such you will really appreciate how much you hate every new song you encounter. It doesn't matter though, when it hits its third or fourth loop it's already too late. You will be merrily singing along to every song and won't notice that your surroundings have somehow morphed into the ninth circle of Hell.\n\nI can't decide whether it's gaming's Citizen Kane or gaming's The Room.","March 22","true","8.1"," 26 of 152 people (17%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","17","26","152","24","3"
