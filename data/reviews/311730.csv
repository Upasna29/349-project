The game is fairly solid (7/10), it does NOT deserve a negative review but I cannot recommend this game because I do not believe the dev will try to fix their mistakes and try to salvage this game on the PC.\n\nThis situation reminds me of a bad indie developer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iwem_xo/recommended/311730/","iwem_xo","iwem.xo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iwem_xo/","1247 products in account","I love this game, but I'm not going to recommend it without severe reservations. The base is an excellent fighter, but the port is worse than the console versions in so many ways. Many of those ways concern the online multiplayer part of the game though, so if you've got a bunch of friends in your area to play this with they might not be so much of an issue.\n\nI'm going to split this in two sections; the base game and the platform comparison. Scroll down if you want to read in what ways it's worse (and better) than the PS4 version.\n\nTHE GAMEPositive:\nVery newbie friendly, with a very good in-depth tutorial mode, a move string practice mode, and combo training. Even if you don't want to train, pressing some buttons will generally make cool moves happen.\nLoads of characters to pick from, with very little "clones" of other characters.\nEverything has a counter. The triangle system (basically rock-paper-scissors replaced with striking-countering-throwing) makes it so that even low tier characters stand a chance.\nLovely stages with lots of interactivity (except for the basic boxing rings). I miss some of the older DOA stages but oh well.\nLots to learn - you'll have to spend quite some time with even a single character to get the most out of them. Most characters have at least one stance change or move during which a whole different moveset becomes available. There's oodles of intricacies to master.\nDecent selection of singleplayer modes - there's one- and two-character versions of survival (beat a bunch of characters without losing your character(s)), time attack (beat a bunch of characters really fast), and arcade (win a bunch of fights). There's also team attack, where you pit a team of up to 7 characters against another team.\nNegative:\nA metric ton of costume DLC, a good deal of which seem to be there just to showcase the female characters' breasts in various ways. Much too expensive, too. Good thing it's optional.\nTHE PORTThe following is all in comparison the the Playstation 4 version. I haven't played the Xbox One version, but I assume all of these points carry over.\nPositive:\nHigher display resolutions possible, with anti-aliasing.\nHigher shadow resolutions. These look really nice and sharp.\nNo input lag. Can't say I've noticed this, but someone who's very good at the game (Master) said so, and it's at least something in favor of the PC version.\nNegative:\nInstability. Every time you exit the game, it crashes. For certain periods of time (weeks) the game will randomly and regularly crash when you're searching for an online match (and then it will be just fine for another period of time - right now it's fine). Sometimes the game hangs on a LOADING... screen when you're done with an online match.\nLess stages. The PS4 version has 3 extra stages compared to the Steam version.\nNo online lobbies. This is a huge loss - online lobbies allow you to invite friends to your game, make impromptu tournaments, spectate other players fighting, and mess around together. What we have now is ranked-only matches. Playing with friends is a matter of luck. You can only search based on rank and location (same/nearby/any).\nRanked only online play. This means that every game matters to your rank, and you can't really mess about too much without dropping down a rank. Again, this also means that you can't invite your friends to an online match.\nNo connection quality filter. If you find an opponent online, it's a crapshoot what the match will be like with regards to connection quality. There's no way to tell in advance, there's no way to filter out bad connections, and there's no way to quit a match with a bad connection without losing rank points. On PS4, you can select a minimum connection quality (expressed in numbers from 1 to 5).\nPeople playing this online on under-spec computers will drag your framerate and game speed down to half. These slow-mo matches are annoying to play, and also can't be quit without penalty or filtered out. On PS4, framerates don't vary. Thankfully though, there aren't that many of these players.\nLess costume features. The costumes from some DLC can be damaged by critical burst attacks on PS4. Not so on PC. The most recent costume DLC (Schoolgirl Strikers) has a feature where a taunt allows you to switch between two costumes. On PC, you just get one of those costumes, and can't switch, even though the pack costs more than it does on PS4 (35 euros vs 30).\nCostume DLC pricing. On PS4, you can buy single costumes. On Steam, you have to buy them per pack, with lots of costumes you'll hardly if ever use. The packs are more expensive on Steam. PS4 has the option to buy a season pass (there's two season passes right now), which will get you a lot of costume packs at a discount. No such thing on Steam.\nDLC Costumes are only visible online to people who have bought the same packs. On PS4, you can download free "catalogs" that allow you to view the DLC costumes other players are using. On PC, only people who own the pack a costume is from can see it online. Other players will just see the default costume.\nSloppy controller support - users of the Xbox One controller have been reporting that their button layouts are messed up for ages, and a fix hasn't been rolled out yet.\nNo subsurface scattering. A relatively subtle graphical effect that improves the look of character's skin is missing on PC.\nCheaters have been reported by several people, and they go unpunished.\nTerrible developer communication. Will we ever get online multplayer lobbies? Who knows! Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo certainly won't tell you. The thinking here is probably that if they don't say anything there won't be such a poop-hitting-the-fan moment as there would if they did acknowledge they're never going to implement it for PC.\nAgain, I love the game, and I'd love new players to spar with, but I don't feel like such a bad port should be rewarded with your money. If you are going to get it, do so while it's on sale.","November 29, 2015","false","174.4"," 512 of 557 people (92%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","92","512","557","10","17"

Chain smoking and gloomy, shaking their heads while editing the lines of code. One guy leaves, never to return. No one notices.\n\nThe game doesn't have achievements, no Steam Cloud support. Hell, it doesn't even support controller vibration. All the effects are PS3-based and if your Steam ID has non-standard characters then the game won't save your data. The "Last Round" edition was advertised having two new stages and both are missing, obviously. Online modes will be patched in indeterminate future. Get this - the official FAQ says that if you're getting any visual problems you should set your desktop resolution to match the game resolution. Did I travel back in time to 1995? Am I expected to edit MemMaker again? Maybe change the Soundblaster IRQ? Nah, there's no surround sound here, only stereo is supported. Maybe it is 1995 after all...\n\nTeam Ninja says this port is based on the arcade version of the game like it would explain all the problems somehow. It's a disaster on par with Deadly Premonition or Devil May Cry 3 on PC. I could excuse the former for being kinda niche and the latter for getting released in 2005, way before Capcom learned that PC gaming is an actual thing. None of these excuses work for DOA5 though, this is a major title in 2015, the same year when Steam hit 125 million users and even MGSV is getting a stellar PC port. How is it possible that Ikaruga got a perfect version with achievements and Steam leaderboards while a huge company like Tecmo can't spare a dime to put one of their flagship titles on PC properly? And they will probably use the bad reviews as proof that they should not bother with PC audience. Because hey, bad sales of Ninja Gaiden Z mean there's no reason to port Ninja Gaiden Black to PC, right?\n\nDOA5 is still a fun game with lots of content even without the online component. It's also one of the most casual-friendly 3D fighters out there but this version is a travesty. I paid $12 for it before Steam region locked everything and stuck with it. Don't buy it now, wait a few months before it's discounted heavily and keep your expectations low.","March 30, 2015","false","3.6"," 1,679 of 2,100 people (80%) found this review helpful 269 people found this review funny","80","679","2","269","73"

BUYER BEWARE.\n\nNote: Despite how low my playtime may be at the time of this review, I have purchased DoA: Ultimate on the PS3 last year and played it to death, it pains me to see the devs not even drop the ball with this PC port, they just flat out never made an attempt to catch.\n\n\nThis game has recieved "plenty" of needed extra attention to ensure that the PC community recieves the "Best Experience Possible" for them. Meaning they dicked around and probably didn't do a damn thing for the months in between the next gen release and now, since it sure doesn't seem like any of the time was spent doing much of anything at all other than keeping features OUT of the port rather than in.\n\nIf you have been out of the loop until you have reached the Store Page of this game and know nothing of what has happened in recent months, the developers for the PC port of this game have essentially created a "Frankenport" of the Arcade and PS3 versions of the game rather than give us the next gen version itself that PS4 players get to experience for reasons I cannot understand.\n\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/dead-or-alive-5-last-round-is-missing-features-on-pc/\n\nWhile the most important feature, being the new characters have been added to the game with no problem, it lacks everything else that is included in all other versions of the Last Round version of DoA5, that being two stages for the versus modes, identical visual quality to the PS3 version of the game barring shadows, a lack of the "Soft Engine" which in the PS4 version of the game includes various graphical effects for added detail, and a lack of an online more because for whatever reason keeping these features out of the PC port took more work than finishing that.\n\nhttp://www.destructoid.com/dead-or-alive-5-last-round-director-asks-modders-to-be-moral--287522.phtml\nhttp://www.lazygamer.net/general-news/team-ninja-threatens-perverted-dead-or-alive-5-modders/\n"“We have to deal with mod issues from an IP holder perspective. We would like to ask PC users to play our game in good moral and manner. Otherwise, we won’t be able to release a title for PC again.”"\n\nIn recent weeks Koei Tecmo have been giving the PC community some negative words in regards to modding, asking us to "keep it moral" (whatever that means) or we may be at risk of no longer getting ports of their games at all, as well as saying that if we wan't to see community made content for their game it would be a BETTER plan to share our ideas with them. Now if you need me to break it down a bit for you, their basically afraid of the PC community being able to make our own costumes and cosmetics for the game when they want so deparately to sell us DLC to the point of asking us to tell them to take our ideas so they can sell it back to us. That's all what this "morality" schlock was as well because with a game like this who the ♥♥♥♥ are you fooling? Not this guy.\n\nNow onto performance, I have a pretty beefy gaming PC now:\nProcessor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz (8 CPUs), ~3.6GHz\nMemory: 8192MB RAM\n2x AMD Radeon R9 270(Crossfire)\n\nSo my comments on performance may be a bit skewed for the rest of the PC community of varying component quality, I haven't experienced any problems in a single arcade mode run other than some slightly noticable slowdowns during win poses. Given the unhelpful minimum specs on the store page for this game I'd hope anyone interested can find a way to see if the game runs well for them since I have no way of testing performance on other systems.\n\nGameplay: I'm using a standard Fighting Stick at the moment, controller and stick controls are rebindable but unfortunately the keyboard controls are both horrible and apparently can't be rebound.\nOn my stick the game plays perfectly fine, nothing wrong here at all despite all the other problems.\nEDIT: Turns out I cannot use my Xbox controller even if I wanted to, the triggers don't work in this game and its functions are mapped to the right stick for some reason. ALSO some camera controlls are impossible to use since the game uses the Arcade version of the game as a base, so right analog stick camera controls are unavailable.\n\nTO CONCLUDE: The devs don't really give a ♥♥♥♥ about the PC community other than having a new outlet to funnel more DLC costumes through, to the point of threatening those who would try and modify the game with never getting another DoA release, but with the quality of the port right now I don't think they should try again until they actually put some effort into it that doesn't DETRACT from the game.\n\nYou have been warned and buy this game at your own risk, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ain't worth it bruh.","March 30, 2015","false","4.5"," 712 of 956 people (74%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","74","712","956","27","16"

It misses key features that the consoles do have. You pay the same amount of money as you would for the console, but for missing features on the pc.<<\n\nThe biggest gamebreaker is to wait for online to come in 3 months, but I think that was obvious for people looking to buy this. Just incase people looking to buy this game and reading this. Now you know.\n\nI think the DOA franchise is pretty fun and one of my favorite, but this time KT gave the pc community the shaft by not porting over several features and making it essentially a PS3™ port. A last generation port in some aspects, because they are too lazy?\n\nMissing features include: The Soft Engine (makes characters look better), which as Silconera explained last year, makes skin appear more natural, has been dropped, 2 stages and PS4™ equivalent particle effects are NOT included.\n\nSome aspect ratios are missing as well. It supports 4k which is neat, but it misses a number of key resolutions. For example, 1920x1200. The best resolution you can get with 16:10 is 1680x1050 which is not really that great if you wish to have a higher res for 16:10 for that kickass monitor you have.\n\nKT pretty much tells the modders community to not mod anything naughty. Before you port a game over the pc, obviously someone might do that. KT pretty much tells people how to mod this game, whats allowed and are limiting the modding communities freedom to do so or else they will refrain from porting another DOA to pc.\n\nNow back to the game. The graphics and missing features bring me to this question. Why would you port over the DOA 5: last round game to the pc if it's essentially going to be a PS3™ version with less features than what you can get if you buy it on the PS4™ console? The background doesn't look as great since the textures quality isn't that great either on this port.\n\nThis only makes the consumers wanting to buy the console version instead of the pc one. Atleast i do, after i came to know about the missing features and graphical effects equivalent to the PS3™ version. It makes me really dissapointed that important features are missing. It doesn't have full controller support which is strange for a fighting game and keys are not rebindable, which makes no sense. If you use a fight stick it won't work properly unless you fiddle around with it somehow by rebinding start and select buttons.\n\nAnother aspect that has caught my attention. Pc gamers are forced to buy a bundle of dlc instead of individual character outfits. Console gamers can buy one outfit per character. Dlc is expensive on steam as it stands now. It is even more expensive than the game itself, so wait for a sale.\n\nAnother con: Found out that senran kagura outfits are not for sale on pc as dlc. For those who do not know. They have a special gimmick that the outfit gets torn when damaged enough. Might be updated or not, depending on KT.\n\nThe only positive side of the pc port is that it's stable, has modding support, resolution options and etc (like shadows). But thats it in my opinion. The game will just not look as good as it would on a next gen console which brings me to the fact that i can't recommend it in it's current state.\n\nOnly things that would get someone to buy this game  or make me recommend it is. If you are a huge pc fan, if you use a controller, if you can live with the PS3 graphics, bad texture quality in backgrounds and if you can wait for online in 3 months then yes it would be something for you.","April 1, 2015","false","26.7"," 295 of 426 people (69%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","69","295","426","12","9"

You decide.\n\nOld Version: Lack of key remap feature, missing PS4 particle effect and soft engine and 2 new stages, but after all,this game can run smooth on most PCs, so the game itself doesn't deserve a negative review.What makes me angry is Koei Tecmo's attitude toward PC players.They hided the detail of the  PC port until two weeks before the game release,and although we have so many complaints they don't even reply once, nor do they address any issue.They just threw some overpriced DLCs to "welcome" us and don't care what we thought, as if we PC players are second rate costomers, thus I have to give them a negative review and remind anyone who want to buy this game to think twice, you may encourage other companies to do as KT.","April 11, 2015","false","676.7"," 177 of 269 people (66%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","66","177","269","10","1"

Mods, while fun and practical at times are not part of the official release and reviews sould not be based on the promise that the community will take it on their own to "FIX" or "ADD" to what the publisher originally released.\n\nThe game might sell with mods, it might even grow with mods and if we allow our selvelves to rate games based on them, we're encouraging developers and publishers to take the easy way out every time; release a mediocre game and let the community deal with it. This won't do any of us any good especially when we're dealing with a developer that has issues with mods and will most likely find ways to render them useless with patches and updates..[/edit]\n\n\nOkay, I'm not usually one to write reviews all that often, however, DOA is nothing short of controversial to say the least and  the spikes of ups and downs did a number on me and I just had to write this...\n\nThere's not much of a story going on, the story mode does a terrible job at introducing characters, one moment you're the US of A, the next you're in Antarctica then Brazil with no explanation on why and/or how you got there, English voice overs are dull and sound detached.\n\nAlso, with all the costumes around you'd think they would dress the Characters in relation to the environment they're in, but no, you have to see Kasumi picking up a fight in Antarctica wearing her Blue Skimpy Ninja outfit, I couldn't stop thinking she'd freeze to death before the fight even began... And why was she in Antarctica in the first place?! (Still talking about "Story" mode here!).\n\n"Story" mode aside, the game IS fun to play, the mechanics are fun and relatively balanced, the moves have a nice flow to them and everything just click like you'd expect.\n\nYou'll have a plethora of unlockables to keep you entertained for months or even years if you're an OCD about it.\n\n\nPros:Extremely Fun to play\nLots of unlockables\nA fair collection of costumes with the original game.\nIt's DOA\n\nCons:$120 for the DLC's?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!\nThe game lacks all its features; No Soft Engine, Two missing stages, previous generation's particle effects and no Online Support (yet)...\nStory mode is ridiculous... pathetic really.\nEnglish Voiceovers are bad.\nController support is a gamble, some people got theirs working just fine, some did not work at all and other like in my case "partially" working with awful mapping and no triggers support (You'd expect team Ninja to pay more attention to controllers compatibility... given that this is a fighting game and all... but noooo.)\n\nSummary:DOA is fun to play, offers a lot to do, the mechanics are relatively good and if you're a long time fan of the game you'll definitely find a reason to enjoy it.\n\nUnfortunately the shortcomings outweigh the goods; awful story mode, missing fundamental features and overpriced DLC's (of which the publishers are admittedly trying to abuse people's fetishes in relation to the characters of the game with costume packs to charge this much).\n\nI'd not recommend DOA Last Round for the average player, not with all its shortcomings, but for the fans of the series, you'll probably just pick this up anyway because of what it is, a long awaited DOA game on PC.\n\nRating: 6 out of 10","April 5, 2015","false","11.6"," 149 of 231 people (65%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","65","149","231","6","3"

Even after reading the warning about the game not having online play available at launch, I reserved a bit of optimisim that it would still be fun to play, regardless; after all, I had played many previous editions with no online support and enjoyed them nonetheless.\n\nHaving now played the game a little bit, I cannot recommend it.\n\nThe game itself looks great, and the move execution is the same as it always has been, which is to say, not the best out there, but certainly good for the game.  The inclusion of so many characters is a nice touch.  Those are the upsides.\n\nNow onto the litany of problems:\n\nThe arcade mode is dismal.  The training mode offers nothing new over the previous iterations.  There are times when the game hiccups a bit - I'm running Dual GTX 970's 32gig of ram, i7 processor and an SSD - there is absolutely no reason this game should ever hiccup.  I pre-ordered this game for quite a bit more than it is now selling for, and I received in return almost nothing, and now, shortly after release, they make the game cheaper.  When I took a look today at the DLC packs available I could not believe my eyes - $65 for a set of 'costumes' for the characters?  Is this some kind of sick joke?  Tecmo wants more than the price of the game itself for add on content that used to be accessible simply by putting time into the game?  And to add insult to injury, there's more than one DLC pack?\n\nIf you're thinking of buying this game, don't.  Wait for it to inevitably be moved to the discount so that at least you won't have to pay full price for the utter disappointment that awaits you.","April 11, 2015","false","116.7"," 122 of 187 people (65%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","65","122","187","9","3"

Here is a full list of what is missing/broken at the moment.\n\nNo online modes, it could be months before they're patched\nThe new particle effects with sparks, snow, fire, dust, etc from the PS4 version\nThe new Soft Engine, which has improved shaders and physics on the PS4 version\n2 stages, Crimson and the Danger Zone\nNo controller rumble and Xbox controllers currently don't map properly\nNo achievements\nNo Steam Cloud saves\nSave files will not work if you change your Steam ID or have certain characters in your name\nThat's quite a bit to swallow... and should be enough reason for most people to avoid this game unless it's on sale or Team Ninja fixes it. Given the publisher track record with Dynasty Warriors though, it is doubtful anything missing is coming... except the promised online.\n\nWith that said, the game looks nice and runs very well. Anti-aliasing and higher resolutions go a long way visually... and the game has yet to lag or stutter for me during any matches (although the occasional cutscene will drop frames). If you have an Xbox controller, you're going to have problems. Using several different Xbox 360 controllers I was not able to map anything to the trigger buttons, and start is mapped to the right analog stick... there's currently no way to fix this. Using a PS3 Mad Catz Fightstick I was able to map any button though... so that means the game has full DirectInput support... but Xinput is busted right now.\n\nI'm sure by now most of you have heard of the Dead or Alive series and know what you are in for in terms of characters and gameplay. It's all there... the addition of power blows and power launchers might throw some people for a loop who haven't played any of the fifth installment. The additions of Raidou and Honoko feel nice... although Honoko at times feels a little over-powered... so hopefully by time online launches there will have been a balance patch.\n\nThis is the first true 3D fighter on Steam... and unfortunately it is a misstep. PR has been poorly handled, with false advertising and dodging questions up until two weeks before launch. Developers have threatened players to not make any mods for the game... and the game itself is just slapped together from an arcade build that was already running on a Windows PC.\n\nI cannot really recommend this game to anyone. If the online turns out to be amazing and the missing content gets added, I'll gladly come back and change this review. As the game stands right now though, it's just a playable 3D fighter with a ton of missed potential.","March 30, 2015","false","46.2"," 205 of 326 people (63%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","63","205","326","15","13"

Unfortunately.\n\nAlthough the gameplay is still true to its nature, the corners they cut for the PC version is absolutely disgusting. Whats more is that there isn't very much compensation for the fact that we paid for the game but got an outdated PS3 version instead of the PS4/XB1 version new maps and new features. If Team Ninja patches or upgrades the game to the point where it is acceptable by both myself and the PC community, I will change my review and recommend the game to my friends but until then, I can't really say that I'm willing to accept what they've done nor will I be able to recommend this game to anyone.","March 30, 2015","false","26.8"," 227 of 365 people (62%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","62","227","365","11","8"

I have an i5 750 that has run every game I throw at it for years now, and even this game runs fine graphically. But once I get into a fight, the entire game slows to a crawl and each player movement takes seconds to complete. It's like I'm playing the game in slow motion. Considering that everything else in the game runs smoothly, I imagine this has to be an optimization problem rather than a technical hurdle they couldn't overcome.\n\nSo it's my fault for pre-ordering, I'm willing to bite the bullet and wait to play it until I upgrade.

That being said, my fanboyism in me is disappointed. However, I'll try to be fair here. My experience thus far with this pc port has been fairly positive.\n\nRig is as follows:\ni7-4790\n16GB ram\nGTX 770 SLI\nWindows 7 64 bit\n\nI've suffered no framerate issues. Game runs just fine at a solid 60 fps with max settings.\nMy controllers have worked fine. I've used my Eightarc Fusion fightstick and Xbox 360 gamepad, both used the same control scheme as the console versions.\n\nThis is far from the worst port I've ever played. Everything has worked fine for me. (minus the online which who knows when that will get here). The gameplay is the solid fast paced fighting I know and love from the franchise. For those who have never played DOA before, it's a 3D fighter with a 3 button control scheme, much like Virtua Fighter. It's one of those easy to learn, hard to master sort of games with a pretty deep combat system. I have over 100 hours in ps3 version, and I can promise it's worth the effort you put in. The single player in this game isn't terrible, but you will begin to wish you were playing with somebody else. The story mode is basically a huge tutorial. It teaches you everything you'll need to know to get started. However, and I know this is subjective, I did not care for the story at all. So to keep yourself busy when you're not in training mode learning the 90+ moves every character has, you get the options of versus mode, arcade mode, survival mode, team fight, and time attack with tag team options. Survival mode is for those who really hate thier fingers. Arcade in my opinion is lacking, theres no character specific mini story to keep you going, just fight till you win and unlock those costumes. Time Attack is for speed freaks. Versus is one on one. And team fighting allows you to pick multiple characters to form a team, and then fight a team of the same size. And thats really all you get in this version, besides a replay function. Is that enough to keep yoiu satisfied? Well that's up to you. Oh, you also get breast motion options, which is pretty awesome.\n\nI will now let my fanboyism talk about what I'm disappointed with. I wanted this to be the superior version of DOA. I wanted it to look the best, run the best, and just be total eye candy that took advantage of more powerful rigs. Well, I learned my lesson there. Delayed for a month for no real reason as far as I can tell. Also what's with goofy thing of not being able to save games if you're username has something other than letters or numbers in it? REALLY??? I'm really upset about the missing stages, which are awesome. Lastly, either I read it wrong somewhere or imagined it, but I was sure this version came with all previous DLC.

Not to mention, some were free on other consoles (Cheerleader outfit). Keep that in mind when determining whether to buy dlc for a lackluster port.\n\nThe game runs well on my crappy laptop, but that's possibly the ONLY positive thing about this port.\n\nFirstly, the controller setup:\n\nWhile I can't speak for people using fightsticks or even those special snowflakes that play fighting games on a keyboard, I can say this: the control scheme for this game is TERRIBLE on controller. The only way to pause the game for me is to press the right stick. Imagine the nightmare that I went to finding that out. The game seems to think that my pause button is RT and select is LT. The face buttons that are normally used in, well, any game really are setup so goofily that I have reason to believe that the development team just setup a poster of an xbox controller, threw darts, and set up the controls based on where the darts stuck. I'm using a logitech pc controller, so the issue may be with me, but seeing as this is the only game in my library that has done this, I'm doubtful that the issue lies with me.\n\nNext, the content:\n\nThis game is clearly incomplete. There is no online mode whatsoever which is said to be patched in within the first few months of the game. Honestly, though, this is ridiculous in the first place. It's a fighting game in 2015. There is little excuse to pay $40 for a game that has no online. It can be argued that having local versus makes up for it, but with the control issues stated above (assuming that fightstick users have the same issues) there's not much sense in even playing locally. Almost all of the costumes that were paid dlc on the console versions are completely locked in this game. There's no online store to buy them, so unless there's some way to unlock theme in-game, all you can do is look at what you can't have. The developers delayed this game once already, but they really should have just finished the game instead of releasing an unfinished product.\n\nGraphically, the game looks good, but keep in mind that this game is a PS3 port with PS4 shadows. There are a few graphics options and many stages run smotthly with few to no frame dips.\n\nThe game also has many characters and plenty of single-player modes such as survival and arcade.\n\nI cannot recommend this game in the state that it's in. Until the problems are patched out, this game will be nothing more than a crappy console port.","March 30, 2015","false","2.5"," 197 of 320 people (62%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","62","197","320","13","3"

It works well.\n- Great fighting game remind me when I had played Tekken. The game is quite fun.\n- English and Japanese Sound with English Subtitle.\n- Nice characters design.\n- Characters are costumable eg. changing dresses (A lot more on DLC), glasses, pantsu color.\n- Awesome graphic effects like drop of water, sand, dirt and so on.\n- Changable System Voice.\n- Lot of playable maps and background music.\n- Movable camera after the battles. Let me watch the character pose in different view XD\n\nCon\n- No Achievements. Although there are in-game titles to unlock but for me if there are steam achievements would be better. I can show it through the showcase.\n- Cant even bind keyboard button. Although i use joypad and I can remap the button but its PC Game. It should be. Not everyone love to use joypad.\n- Joypad vibration is not supported.\n- No Steam Cloud. This is useful function. It ensure that I wont lose the save files.\n- No Soft Engine. Although my fav character is Marie, I still need it.\n- No Extra Stages.\n- Screen tearing occured in the game ! Seriously ? So annoying ! (Fixed by forcing Vsync on via graphic card control panel like NVIDIA Control Panel) Actually it need to be in the game setting.\n- DLCs price are a little bit too high ! I think having separated DLC for each characters would be better.\n\n- A little bit too late online mode releasing date.\n\nSummary\nAlthough the game is ported quite good, there are a lot more to  improve and update. I don't recommend the game in full price for now until they release a improving patch. But if you are the one who love to play fighting game like Tekken and you don't mind things I listed above it would worth it for you.\n\n5.5/10","March 30, 2015","false","17.8"," 139 of 222 people (63%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","63","139","222","10","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maximumslothfulness/recommended/311730/","maximumslothfulness","Maximum Sloth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maximumslothfulness/","618 products in account","I will keep this review short. I am sorry to say that I give this game a thumbs down.\n\nNow sit down you little pervert, I am going to tell you a great, well maybe not great..more like sad..story..\n\nWay back before Dead or Alive 5 released on PC I remembered how much fun I had had playing it on the 360, so I checked the forums and read the store page description - online added in 3 months, looked like decent support from KT and Team Ninja would follow release, and they replied on the forums that they would not be bowing to the SJW crowd with their character models, which earned my respect and a pre-order. Then, it all went down hill faster than you could say, "but bouncy boobs!"\n\nIt all started with the initial slap in the face - PC gamers did not get all the stages that the consoles received, nor even all of the stage SFX(we still have the stage-outs, though..oh joy!), and then the backhand- the game's graphics are serviceable, but nothing like they could be, or should have been. This is a port of the arcade version, not the newer, shinier, better looking, with better graphics and features the consoles received(one could argue no jaggies here, but still..). This will never receive an update to put it on par with the superior console version because it's not running on the same engine - which includes damaged outfits, better skin shading etc., Fine, I could live with it. I had bouncy boobs and slick moves to keep me entertained.\n\nThen comes the 3 month mark, and lo! the online was not released. Instead, it came to us in the form of a beta. It was functional, but barely - plagued by crashes, a lack of options for region selection(players could select a region, but only on a very broad, very basic level - thus players would be paired up with people from EU despite picking NA etc.,) no cross-platform and no lobby system. They kept pushing its official non-beta release back, and kept pushing it back until it was finally released a significant period of time AFTER the date stated on the store page - and it is basically the same as beta with slightly better matchmaking and fewer crashes, but still none of the other noted options. It looks like we will never get those options, either. Moreover, there are not many people playing online anyway. While we're mentioning updates - Did I mention the significant lack of any substantial updates in any way, shape, or form? Yeah, that's right. None.\n\nJust to beat us over the head even further, they release loads of costume DLC at a cost, on average, on par with the price of the game or double it. Ok, they're just cosmetic and some of them include a hefty amount of costumes but again - those costumes do not feature any of the destructibility or additional SFX given to those who buy them on console. Not only that, but they keep vomiting out these DLC costume packs without actually updating the core game. We have barely received any of the balance updates et al., that the consoles have received. Not only that, but they're also releasing a DLC character for the PC and consoles and, you guessed it! PC doesn't get the stage she comes with, but consoles do. We also don't get any of the destructibility of her outfit.\n\nThen, to pour salt into the gaping wound and kick us while we're down, the rest of the game is ACTUALLY FUN. It runs smoothly for me fully maxed out- on both a gtx780 and the replacement gtx980ti. The animation is fluid, looks nice, and attacks look like they genuinely flow into one another so it's fun to pull off a fancy combo. It sounds nice, the character voices are also decent, and the roster is quite large with each character feeling satisfyingly unique in fighting style and animation. In addition, there are neat water effects (wet clothing after a fight from sweat, or when a character falls in water) and it's nice to see dirt on a character's skin with a bead of sweat trickling down his/her head after a fight.\n\nEven better, no matter how experienced someone is in the fighting game genre - anyone can pick it up and play it - I recommend a controller or a fight stick. I did not try it with keyboard. A new player can still witness the flashy moves resulting from his/her inputs and cool combos just as much as an experienced player - granted the experienced player can pull off more combos etc., because the skill ceiling, I believe, is fairly high and the combat system is decently complex.\n\nThere's also a single player story mode that's, well, there...The story isn't really much to pay attention to and the only purpose it serves is to get players used to some of the characters' combos and such.\n\nOh and did I mention they even added the ability to choose how bouncy the boobs are?\n( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) HOW. BOUNCY. THEY. ARE! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Bless our adolescent perverted little hearts.\n\nSo to conclude, if you're someone who is really desperate for a fighting game to play offline with friends and for an excuse to slobber all over your keyboard as you watch the heaving of your favorite DOA5 waifu's breasts - then I guess you could spend the $40. For anyone who wants a fun, competitive, well-supported fighting game with responsive developers who actually care about their PC community -- I beg you, please look elsewhere.","March 24","false","50.0"," 36 of 48 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","36","48","5","1"

Framerate issues, visible delays in audio during cut-scenes, loss of sound during some video sequences, no achievements, no steamworks integration, not even online multiplayer at launch.... that really isn't acceptable in 2015 (it wasn't even nice in 2014 mind you).

I bought the game because I accepted this.\n\nShort Pro/Con Summary\n\nPros:\n\n+A good port. Runs even smooth on low end systems.\n+Still a rare genre on PC (Fighting games).\n+Base game already contains a lot of different costumes compared to other fighting games.\n+Decent graphics (even with that missing next gen features it still looks good).\n+Decent gameplay (if you like the style of course).\n+Sex appeal.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Ridiculous DLC policy. (There are already 4 costume packs that costs 241.- Euro, and more will follow....)\n-Missing online support has to be patched in within few months after release.\n-No trading cards.\n-No archivements.\n-The official system requirement informations are far away from the real requirements. (Runs well on far lower systems)\n-Clothes are frequently bugged while fighting.\n-Critical savefile bug (maybe intended I don't know) that is bound to your Steam username.\n\n\nImpression:\n\nIf you can live with the missing features the next gen consoles have, and also if you can live without being able to play online (at the moment), in that case, I have to say that this game is a decent fighting game.\n\nBut be aware, if you are used to the combat style of the Street Fighters series or the King of Fighters, DOA plays totally different, since its more important to press your buttons in the right combination and order to activate combos, instead of pressing like ↓→ + punch button to activate skills in other games. Since this was my first DOA game I played since 2005 or so, I had to get used to it's style once again.\n\nIncluded are a lot of hot virtual babes.... And I think they look better than girls on any other fighting games avalable on PC at the moment. But yeah I think you knew this already.....\n\nThere is also a story mode, that is not to long, but also not to short, and it really helps you to know a bit about the characters of DOA. The story mode works like the one in Mortal Kombat 9, where you switch between characters while playing through it.\n\nSo, what else do you get with this game? To be honest, the problem with any fighting game nowadays without online support is, you get bored fast.... So all you can do while waiting for the online patch is playing the solo/tag arcade mode to unlock all those avalable costumes, or practicing in practice mode or tutorials to be ready when online mode is there.\n\nAbout the DLCs..... I think KT imagines people like this. A horny teenager boy asks his father "Dad, I really need like 250 bucks to change clothes for my half naked virtual girls!" Dad says "Of course my son, just give me a min I need to poop that money fast, brb".....\n\nSo at the moment I have to say, if you are a big fan of playing offline games using cute girls, then this might be something for you, but if not, just pass by and wait for a sale or the online patch first.\n\n*I think $19,99 USD would be a fair price for this game.","April 8, 2015","false","21.9"," 111 of 179 people (62%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","62","111","179","9","2"

Meh...)\n\nCons:\n-Half done job (Missing features)\n-Grotesquely expensive DLC (111€ for both, are you serious?!?!)\n-Mod restrictions (Not to be whiney... But Mods are a big reason I almost exclusively play on PC)\n-Crappy port\n-Not all controllers are compatible\n-No internet connection(I know it's previewed after three months... But Imho it's still quite in a nebulous state)\n-Was not very upfront with alot of the features (Sure the online thing they were upfront of it... But the rest... Honestly that does spell half-♥♥♥ job for me)\n\nMisc:\n-Breast motion option made me laugh\n-Japanese apparently do not programmer their console games with computers\n-I hear people have issues running the game and hope there will be a remedy for their problem\n-I was lucky, atleast one of my controllers work properly\n\nNotes:\n-Well, I hear there are nude mods already out there and this will obviously be the last DOA game here... Frankly I'm not too beat up about it because they did a half-♥♥♥ job at porting it... I mean come on! Seriously!\n-I wonder if they're gonna have the balls to make the soft engin along with the particle engin as a DLC?... But if they do that honestly that would blow...

It is without a doubt, the most fan service oriented fighting game out there, but it sacrifices so much in exchange, that you must be one hell of a fan to forgive all of its shortcomings.\n\nAs it happens, I am not a Dead or Alive fan. I do like fighting games, and I like to own a lot of them, so that when friends come over I can pop one on the TV and we play a quick bit of loser passes the controller. Dead or Alive is excellent for this because it’s system and execution are extremely welcoming to anyone. You have a button for punching, and one for kicking. One other button to grab, and one button dedicated to no-selling your opponent’s punches and kicks by catching them with the right timing and then rubbing it in their faces. It is simple, easy to learn, hard to master. Beginners will be delighted to see all the cool stuff their guy or gal can do with just a few button presses. While dedicated players can read into the complex stun and juggle systems to really lay the smack down on your opponent.\n\nThe game comes with a tonne of modes, and a tonne of content. This DoA once again comes with a big, fleshed out story mode. Over 50 chapters, each bookended with cut scenes and voiced dialogue. It is not particularly well written and performed. In fact it is downright embarrassing at times. The majority of the plot was completely lost on me. An evil corporation is has been taken over by the ceo’s daughter and she is trying to start the company off with a clean slate. Best course of action? Well let’s do everything the old company did again, exactly the same, and pretend we didn’t know. Once again a Dead or Alive fighting tournament is held to invite the world’s greatest martial artists to determine who is the best. How this serves anyone is completely beyond me, but I guess any excuse to have girls fight each other in impractical clothing is as good as any.\n\nRounding out the modes are your traditional one-on-one versus modes. Arcade, survival, team battles, you name it. There’s even a photo studio to snap pics of your favourite characters in your favourite costumes. Let me tell you, there are costumes. Even without the outrageously priced DLC, the game contains a lot of costumes to unlock. From army fatigues and suits of armour, all the way to sling bikinis and skin-tight leather cat suits that leave very little to the imagination.\n\nAll these modes and costumes are nice and all. And even when you’re playing the game, you notice the graphical fidelity as the characters each drip with sweat and get visibly dirty. Insane effects such as exploding helicopters, collapsing skyscrapers and giant Buddha statues all pass the venue at a smooth 60 frames per second.\n\nPretty good.\n\nExcept that it isn’t.\n\nWhile all your modes are present in this game, one is seriously broken. The online mode is a train wreck. Devoid of practically any modes besides ranked match, the online component is an afterthought. Furthermore, the connection and net code are generally abysmal. Frame and input lag are commonplace. You can’t play with your friends, you can’t play for fun. You must play for real all the time and you have to do with a colossal handicap. That is, if you can even get a match going in the first place. Unsurprisingly, with such awful online battles, no one is going to want to play it to begin with.\n\nAnd even then, when you dismiss the online, you’re still left with a sub-par port. This PC version is based on the PS3 version. Which is a direct affront to anyone with a decent rig. The PS4 version is out there, laughing at anyone who spends money on this husk. Sure it looks nice, but it could have looked so much better. No, instead Koei would have you pay premium for the privilege to play this on a PC, in a washed out form. Additionally, the game is unstable; shutting the game down crashes it. Framerates jump and dive between cut scenes and gameplay. Not a big deal, but it shouldn’t be happening. Furthermore, the default button layout leaves much to be desired. For instance, pressing the tumbstick pauses the game. Certain combination buttons are found under the start button instead. And if that weren’t enough there is the DLC.\n\nHumour me for a moment. Go to the steam store and look up this game. Yes? I’ll wait. Don’t worry. Look at the DLC. See that? That is more than the game costs or is worth. Sure, it’s a truckload of costumes, but why so expensive? Not even Capcom is this exorbitant in its pricing. This wouldn’t be so bad it is was entirely optional, but the game has the nerve to dangle it before your eyes like you could possibly unlock it by playing the game. No. Not even close.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/358142/\n\nEvidently, despite all of its exquisite costume crafting and scintillating jiggle physics, the game has all the makings of a quick money grabbing scheme. Busted online and poorly optimised performance make the game a complete joke in respect to its basic price point. I can buy the PS4 version for less. You can buy the PS4 version for less. If you want to play DoA5 Last round, buy the PS4 version. However, you can’t or you must have some way of posting prettily rendered T&A on steam, then you could, possibly, maybe, consider getting this on a sale.\n\nPlease also check out Completing the Backlog's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","January 6","false","9.5"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","31","43","4","2"

It’s one of the major fighting franchises for a reason.\n-It runs well. It’s a PS3/X360 game after all, and it had been optimized for a low-profile PC-based arcade board as well, so it runs perfectly with shadows on at 60fps at 720p and FXAA on machines below minimal requirements. Don't be fooled by the i7 requirement; if you can run other last-gen games fine then you can run this.\n\nCons:\n-It’s a PS3/X360 game missing features from the PS4/XBone version, even stages. The only next-gen “features” are high resolution and true antialiasing, as if you couldn’t do that with any other game.\n-No key rebinding.\n-Actually, scratch that: when you plug a controller in and customize it, it DOES MESS with the key bindings as well. You got used to the default keys? Congratulations, now the keys have swapped just because you configured the buttons of a controller.\n-DLC comes in big bundles only.\n\nAll in all, I’m enjoying the game and I don’t regret buying it, but this is a case where I honestly have to give a negative review because of the amount of disdain this port was done with.","June 19, 2015","false","27.3"," 39 of 59 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","39","59","0","0"

I expected a functional online RELEASE, not beta.\n\n\n\nLet's me get this straight. It exceeds my expectation. Althought I have extremely low expectation to begin with.\n\nController support were ok. I have F310, which means it supports XInput and DirectInput, both worked well with some config in game, which means covers 99% of pc controller. "Not all controller are test", They are probably being cautious.\n\nPC Specs are higher than what graphic should require, but it's not night unplayable. I have GTX970 plus i5-3470, it worked pretty well except a bit lower framerate in cutsence and menu, but it runs stable 60FPS in game, that's what it matters.\n\nIt's not good, but not horrendous either. The 'NO' in the recommend section is to judge this game as a PC FTG alone--No netplay in 2015 is not acceptable. I might change it if Koei showed their effort in supporting this game. It's enjoyable if you are a DOA fan like me, just make sure to know that you are not paying for the most bang of your buck at this moment.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alfrednt/recommended/311730/","Alfrednt","Crazyb2000","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alfrednt/","560 products in account","Last year I decided I'd be a wise man and pre-order this undoubtedly top of the grade PC port of Dead or Alive 5 Last Round. I hadn't really played a Dead or Alive game since I was a lot younger, last one I played being 3 I think. The idea of owning the game that had some of gaming's most attractive character design and elaborate scenery enticed me very much. Essentially I'm a sucker for good character aesthetics.\n\nNow, it had been a while since I actually played a DOA game. Most of my knowledge came from videos of other people playing and I bought this because I really... REALLY liked the look of it. Then I decided to hang around the community hub. There was outrage and intrigue, people were attacking each other about what features would be in and what wouldn't. "They'll make a crappy port" "Surely TK cares!"... Well, it only took the first delay of the game's release for me to raise my eyebrow on the whole situation.\n\nThen it appeared. Only a few days after my birthday. I was excited, I stopped caring about all the features that were lost. Only... I didn't realize how much there actually was missing. My first thought was "Oh no" when I saw that the default use and enter command was "M" on the keyboard. I went straight into options and tried to go to the controller option but I instead got a very rude "RRRR" noise. I felt like I answered a question wrongly on a family panel show. It denied me access to the "change your bindings" menu. Of course, this didn't sink in at first. Only after about 12 attempts at pressing M on the damn thing did I realize that it was impossible.\n\nI got my controller, plugged it in and restarted the game (because you have to restart in order to change controller type). I was going to try and play this safe. I hadn't played a DOA game in ages so I went into the training section and started the tutorial. Fairly straightforward. Then the combos happened...\n\nOH MY ♥♥♥♥ING GOD THE ♥♥♥♥ING COMBOS HOLY ♥♥♥♥. I don't think I've ever been this angry with a game. I actually started swearing out loud at this ♥♥♥♥ing thing. Every single little movement on my controller was picked up. One of the combos needed me to go diagonally down so I tried. GUESS WHAT!? It went down, diagonal, right in a split second, breaking the combo. After a good 10 minutes of trying this I unplugged my controller and restarted the game... again. I thought to myself that playing with the keyboard has to be better than a glitchy controller. I started the tutorial from the beginning to get used to the new key bindings which were horrible. I felt like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ T-Rex.\n\nCombos... Back to this. With my keyboard, movements register more accurately so I tried. And tried. And tried.... Well it didn't matter that I perfectly produced the combo as it displayed, it still didn't ♥♥♥♥ing work. Realizing that this was near impossible I decided to go with the controller again... Plug in controller and restart game. After ages of swearing to myself and cursing the gods, I finally did it. Bliss. I did the ♥♥♥♥ing tutorial for combos.\n\nThen came the test "Follow up with a critical burst"... Uh huh... Okay... ♥♥♥♥... This took 3 ♥♥♥♥ing tries because of how glitchy the controller input was. But I did it. I beat the enemy... Then came more combo tutorials... Yeah no, I quit out of that straight away. At this point I was so damn mad that I felt my blood pumping. One of the other kickers was how the stupid thing went down to 30 FPS every time a cutscene appeared. WHY!? I seriously don't get why it's capped like that for cutscenes. This is an issue present on the consoles versions too.\n\nI decided to play the story and while it was very hard to follow, I, believe it or not, had fun. I didn't even need to button mash. The graphics, while not as good as the PS4 version (can't believe I actually said that) still were pretty good. The music the gameplay the everything... was actually great.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is despite it's faults as a game and its faults as a port, there is still fun to be had.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a piece of ♥♥♥♥ port. The developers/publishers don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the PC audience but, hey, it could be hell of a lot worse...\n\nSo...\n\nSo...\n\nSo much worse...\n\nBut yeah I like it. Can't really recommend it for the average gamer though. It's like trying to knit a motherboard with wire.\n\n","March 30, 2015","false","3.1"," 62 of 101 people (61%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","61","62","101","7","1"

The gameplay is fun, the story mode is ridiculous nonsense that only has the new Mortal Kombat reboot series as a rival.\n\nI can't recommend this though. Why? Because I feel there's a 75% chance they're going to put out DOA5: Final Lap or something and do it all again. When is the safe time to buy a DOA game under Koei? On Day One if you don't care about everything you're NOT getting, or more likely, the day they release the next numbered DOA game.\n\nThat's not even mentioning how substandard this PC edition is, shipping without online play and based on the PS3 release's physics and lighting, and not using all the bells and whistles of new costumes. The DLC costumes don't tear, even though the price of said DLC is still in denial. The place to get this series is on console, if you get it at all. Who cares about online play and graphics when you've got hundreds of dollars of DLC just waiting for you? That's what matters, right? The funny thing is DOA5 really is sort of Free To Play on console, with rotating fighters available.\n\nIt's sad because you see this nightmare skin shop that  DOA has become, and you see how far former creative director/team lead Tomonobu Itagaki has fallen with Devil's Third on Wii U, and you wonder about what an alternate DOA5 might have been like. It really was one of those "sum is greater" pairings.\n\nThis is the last DOA game I'm buying. I've been beaten, I feel like I've lost. Not really sure how much of a win that is for the publisher though. Kind of weird behavior if your goal is to make money and all.","January 4","false","0.4"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","24","34","3","0"

The game is gorgeous if you know what you're doing. Look for comparison shots and see how the models are smoother and jaggies are practically gone. Mix it up with FX or ENBs or whatever and it's 2x better than PS4 graphics.\n\n-However, the textures are a little low res, especially ground textures and details on the clothes. Modding could fix that hopefully. It could use more graphics options too.\n\n+Mods. It works. The files are encrypted, but there's always a way around it. So far I could only change eye colors and clothing, but the fact that it is moddable is a big plus.\n\n-No online up until now which sucks.

It's going to suffer a lot of lag and glitches on its first day.\n\n-They've added achievements but are still unattainable.\n\n+It's cheap compared to the console versions, at least, in my country.

The missing features are the soft engine, two stages, and particles. TN will probably add the stages and particles in the future. If you think the soft engine is what makes this game special, don't buy the PC version. Simple as that. But it's a fighting game, you won't get to notice it while you're too focused on playing.\n\nBut still, it's an eye-candy game with good fighting mechanics and pretty girls.\nCome for the girls, stay for the fightan.","April 2, 2015","true","37.0"," 153 of 270 people (57%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","57","153","270","18","10"

Now, now, I know there are better games to use as test subjects than one that involves nothing but glistening skins of girls, breasts and a possible turn on for ryona lovers but I've seen how this game runs on the ps4 and I simply wanted to compare.\n\nFor the first time I played this on steam there was something I noticed right off the bat; this wasn't the game I ordered. The game I ordered supposedly was a game that included ripping clothes, unrealistically bouncing breasts, amazing sweat details and an online function. Instead I got this poor copy that desparately tries to winover people through an amazingly bad arcade mode and a story mode that I have never bothered to play because it's ♥♥♥♥.\n\nMorethan the game I ordered, this game has amazing character art and I believe they are rendered better here than that on the PS4. The usual characters people know and love are more beautiful here than in any release. I for one believed that Marie Rose here is extremely cute because of the impressive attention to detail the development team gave to her.\n\nHowever, like the game i ordered, unless you love a character so much that you rather stare at her get powerbombed to oblivion in the same 2 costumes over and over you will have to buy the costume pack that costs much more than the game which is apparently 'in discount' right now. When a game has a more expensive dlc than the game itself, you know something definitely went wrong somewhere... and there are two of them! Both more expensive than the actual game!\n\nYou cannot play multiplayer with this game. I could probably play multiplayer with the game I ordered but not this one. You see the online function is not available yet. Of course if you want to, you could always play with another person beside you assuming you have two controllers but I do not recommend it unless you're trying to court that person. Play this game with him or her at night until your partner decides he or she wants to experience the same grappling your characters are doing on screen. Of course with the lack of the bouncing physics right now I could be wrong but maybe those well voice-acted moans and groans will still give you a chance. But who cares about multiplayer in a fighting game right? No biggie.\n\nThere are more stages in the game I ordered than in this game. I am not entirely sure why they cut out two stages from the game. Cutting features off is always a bad thing. Speaking of cutting, I remember one time when I found out that the wallpaper I bought for my room was too long. So like an idiot i tried cutting it lengthwise by myself and accidentally stabbed my left hand. There was lots of blood and I think the cut was at least half an inch deep. The first thing I did was to stop the bleeding then check for any strings I might've cut. After that I told myself never to- oh right, the game!\n\nThe arcade mode for this game is utter garbage. After beating eight people? I'm not really too sure since I was too busy complaining to steamsupport for not giving me the game i ordered. You are rewarded with a bunch of achievements. Cool, i got an achievement for losing once, there isn't many out there that pat you on the back for ♥♥♥♥ing up. But anyway, if you hate those games that offer a good cinematic ending after completing the arcade mode then rejoice for the only reward you get other than some achievements, and a different color of the initial costumes you were given is a rest from the game by being sent back to the menu screen.\n\nYou remember super street fighter four, blaz blue and even marvel versus capcom's feature where characters sometime say different lines when fighting specific opponents? It's not in this game. By the end of one arcade mode you'll probably memorize the intro lines and ending lines of your character unless you're too mesmerized by her unbouncing breasts. I don't know if it's different from story mode, but I doubt it since the original team that made the game i ordered probably already wasted all the budget on the breast bouncing physics that's not on this game.\n\nHmm... what else... the special is amazing... once. Unless you can use it properly to throw or slam your opponent to interactable places on the stage... which are few it gets pretty stale pretty fast. Sure it's always fun to see your character kick her opponent up crashing against a helicopter but to do this not only do you need to position your opponent properly in front of the helicopter but also need to be at relatively low health. So perfectionists who want to end the fight with a finishing move can suck a salty sausage.\n\nThe amount of characters is also good. They finally completed all the standard requirements for an eye candy game by adding a loli. We now have a big boobed heroine, an equally large breasted rival, the generic goody goody guy, a hideyoshi, a sadistic woman, an overly serious man, a ninja, some hurly burly man for those sadistic needs and a jailbait; I think we have the complete set.\n\nThe soundtrack is okay... Well, no, I personally think the tune in the beginning was too loud. It felt like the developers were conditioning you to get pumped up for some multiplayer battle but with the absence of an online function it's now just some pretentious generic tune. Only Marie Rose had a good character soundtrack. Everyone else felt like they had generic tunes partnered with them just for the sake of them having a tune each.\n\nThere are already mods for this game but since other people are working on them and not the hardworking developers who didn't give me the game I ordered I am not giving the game any points for that. Overall maybe in three months this game will look like the game I ordered but I'm not sure I'll still have this in my library by then. For now, I recommend to everyone to look away from this game, no matter how much those breasts in the posters tempt you.","April 7, 2015","false","20.3"," 97 of 168 people (58%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","58","97","168","22","1"

There is a said, the more you expect for something, it usually turn out to be a dull, that is true for this game - I am sorry to called it a lazy console port. Current price tag seems extremely higher than during pre-order not really a wise investment, plus if you don't have an Xbox 360 controller for Windows,  stay far away from this game.\n\n\nLet's face it...\n\nPros:\n- It's fun – much like the way on the Xbox360 / PS3.\n- Added pre-purchased costumes\n- One of the few fighting game which I stay in front of PC for over an hour. (Thanks to the Xbox 360 controller for Windows)\n\nCons:\n- The game (luckily) detected Xbox 360 controller for Windows but vibration isn’t there…\n- No customization for keyboard...\n- Obviously a lazy console port with limited resolutions available 1)conventional Windows 98 resolutions or 2) Full HD or 3) 4k resolution – all resolution are hard-coded and the missing required hacked to get it back...\n- Graphic are aged – Even Tomb Raider that released nearly 2 years back are realistic than this one. PC version do not really shared the visual similarity from Xbox One / PlayStation 4 but Xbox 360 / Playstation 3 which dated nearly a decade.\n- Price went up crazy after unlocked and Downloadable content which sold separately with sexier costume are now cost more than the game itself during pre-purchase...\n\nConclusion: As per summary above plus I've give it the disappointed 4 out of 10.","April 1, 2015","false","4.4"," 97 of 169 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","97","169","3","0"

With almost everyone else either going 2D or '2.5D', DOA5 remains as the best full 3D fighter you can buy. Fight system is fluid, easy to learn, but hard to master with interractive environments. The game still looks great, despite the fact that we've been given a frankenport instead of the proper current gen version. And of course, there's dat good ol' T&A'. At face value, it should be a great game, and it is. Yet, I can't recommend this to the layman. For reasons below.....\n\nThe launch of this game was handled poorly. The fact that we've been given the frankenport is bad enough. But they never told us this, until 2 weeks before launch. And to further add salt to the wounds, online functionality was delayed. Granted we knew about this beforehand, but we've only now received it. And even then, it's a barebones version of what the consoles have. That we even have players online after all of this is something of a miracle.\n\nWe've gotta talk about DLC. Currently, the cost of all available costume packs combined will cost you $465USD. Or, if you're in STRAYA like me, the conversion adds up to $640AUD. Inexcusable in its own right, but then consider that alot of these costumes consist of 3 templates copypasted across several characters. TN have taken shortcuts with these packs, and want to charge you top dollar. My saying this is probably hypocritical, since I own many of these packs already. But I'm an idiot, so you should do as monkey say, not as monkey do.\n\nIn summary, I can only REALLY recommend this game if you're a dedicated fan like me, and don't have a current gen console. And considering steam can't censor moonrunes, I have a special message for the developers. 私はあなたのすべてが火で死ぬ願っています","October 8, 2015","false","84.8"," 28 of 43 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","28","43","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frakme/recommended/311730/","frakme","Zeno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frakme/","247 products in account","Let’s get this out of the way – it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles that it should. There’s a couple of missing stages and the Soft Engine does not appear in this port. There’s no Steam Cloud support and there’s speculation about the safety of your save data if you change your Steam ID. It’s also going to be missing online multiplayer for up to three months. Oh, and you can't rebind your keys. Since the game was announced, it’s fair (and a bit of an understatement) to say that Tecmo Koei and Team Ninja have been uncommunicative. Without a doubt, KT did not deliver the best product that they could have. If this is enough to dissuade you from purchasing the game, no one could blame you. This type of behavior from a developer should not come without its consequences, and I commend you for taking a stand.\n\nHowever, what I’m going to do from this point is look at the game for what it is, and not what it could or should be. If you’re looking for a fun 3D fighting game with tight mechanics and sharp graphics, look no further. Speaking from experience, despite lacking the Soft Engine, Last Round looks better here than it does on the Xbox One. At the time of writing this, I’ve got about three hours in and I’ve noticed no performance hitches and the framerate solidly stays at 60 (I’ll post my specs at the bottom so you can compare). Unfortunately, the graphics settings have to be configured via a separate configuration tool, and the options themselves are somewhat limited. It supports up to 4K resolution and 4x SSAA, and it gives you the option of changing shadow resolutions (as well as turning them off altogether). Let’s move on to content.\n\nRight out of the gate you have access to 34 characters, each with a number of unique costumes and hairstyles. There are 24 stages for you to fight on in either solo or tag matches, some of which include separate areas that your opponents (or you) can be punched, kicked, thrown or otherwise knocked into. Many maps also include environmental hazards that can cause extra damage when someone is knocked into them, usually resulting in an explosion.\n\nAs far as the actually gameplay goes, the combat is a very simple but satisfying formula. There are three main aspects to the combat – strikes, holds and throws – and they work in a sort of rock-paper-scissors-like fashion.  Strikes are effective against throws, which are effective against holds, which in turn are effective against strikes. While you may be able to get by with a basic understanding of the system at first, you will have to learn how to effectively use holds and string lengthy combos together if you hope to stand a chance against more difficult opponents. When it comes to actually controlling the game, I can't speak for the keyboard controls (they look god-awful), but I've been using a DS4 and haven't had any problems with it.\n\nAside from that, you can expect your standard fighter experience with arcade ladders, survival mode and time attack. One fairly unique game mode called team fight allows you to pit two teams of up to seven fighters against one another, and it’s rather fun. There’s also a story mode, if you really care.\n\nSo, would I recommend it? No, I wouldn't. Don't get me wrong, the game is fun. It’s technically sound and the gameplay is fast and fun. The music is great and the aesthetics are as well. Everything about this game as it is, is perfectly enjoyable. If you don't care about KT's behavior and just want to play the game, then buy it; I think you'll enjoy it.  However, I think it’s more important that as consumers, and not just PC gamers, we take a stand against lazy ports. Because of this, I can't personally recommend the game. There’s no reason to believe that KT couldn’t have delivered a better product. They’ve hardly even spoken about the port at all, and as far as I know, they haven’t expressed any reason as to why we weren’t getting the best version of the game. So buy it on sale, and show them that we want their work on this platform – but only if it’s up to par.\n\nSPECS:\ni5 3570K @ 3.4 GHz\n8GB RAM\nGTX 750 Ti\nWindows 7\n\n*Conclusion edited to be made more concise","March 30, 2015","false","49.3"," 47 of 78 people (60%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","60","47","78","5","0"

This game's counter mechanic makes it feel so god awful random. They have this system where you stun your opponent with a certain attack where he's unable to do anything. This is where the guessing game begins, which I hate! You keep hitting him with more stun attacks while he mashes counters for mid kick, mid punch, low, and highs. It just makes it feel so casual in my opinion. It's probably just me, but when you touch perfection, you have to look down on the rest ._.","September 14, 2015","false","10.8"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","21","31","0","0"

I bought this version as DOA is my favorite fighting game of all time and I want to play it when I travel on my laptop. Here's a few details about the difference between the two versions:\n\nGraphics\nDon;t be so quick to dismiss the PC version. The graphics are basically equal on both versions (But I get a better framerate on my laptop). All this noise about the soft engine and some items being equivalent to the ps3 version is totally crazy. MAYBE if I bring my laptop downstairs and pause both versions side by side I'd see a difference....no guarantees. Giving this game a bad review due to the lack of the soft engine is like hating a hamburger because the bun has 2% less sesame seeds.\n\nCost\nPC version is way cheaper! The PS4 version (which I bought from PSN) is really weird. You have to download the demo, and then buy the story as DLC for $13 (which I regret doing...the story mode is beyond useless). Then you have to pay $50 for the 30 characters. That was $63 compared to Steams $40 AND I got a million costume packs for the steam edition. All the ps4 costumes are expensive as hell.\n\n***Quick side note - I bought the story mode on PSN because I thought you needed it to get trophies....but there aren't any on PSN either. Very strange as I thought every playstation game was required to have them.\n\nOnline\nNo debate here....PS4 has full online with the cool share button features as well. No steam online for 3 months which would make this a terrible purchase for you if you only play online. I mainly play local competitive or arcade mode so I'm not missing out.\n\nRandom thoughts\n\nThe loading time on the PS4 is surprisingly good, but not nearly as nice as having the game installed on your SSD. Game is extremely fast on steam!\n\nI have the wireless 360 controller for windows and it works flawlessly. No strange button maps here.\n\nI'm using a laptop with a nvidia 770M (Which is low/mid range compared to desktop cards). The game runs flawlessly @1080p and I never see any slowdown.\n\nPeople still care about steam achievements??? They're so useless O.o\n\nAnyways... I do agree about the online functionality. Hopefully that gets fixed sooner than later. But all these other complaints seem really unnecessary. Go out and try the PS4 version if you really want to see the difference in graphics. The game play is identical, with the exception of the better loading times which makes a big difference for me.\n\n","March 30, 2015","true","3.7"," 167 of 302 people (55%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","55","167","302","9","9"

Being a fan of the series, it really is a shame that it's turned to what is it today. I'll try to be as honest as I can about it. Right off the back the game visually is a pretty game. As time passes, it holds up well. When the game came out there were delays, and promises that weren't kept. Disappointing, yes, but I felt like this was an oppurtunity for the modding community to really shine. The first thing that came to mind was texture updates, making the game look more "next-gen". There were some, but it was then later buried under the massive amount of "fanservice-like" mods, which was also expected. The DLC for the game is outrageously overpriced and when compared to the versions of the DLC that were released for the consoles, some of them are missing some pretty cool and different features. Such as Console only costumes and certain costumes that can change form in mid game. I couldn't get myself to learn how to play with the keyboard, so I plugged in my Gamepad (Xbox One controller), it was immediately recognized and I went on to fight. Everything at the time felt smooth and just as I can remember any DOA game, with the exception of a few changes, like a few different moves and button combos. With every update it seemed the game just got better and better, mainly performance wise. Things ran smoother, until an update some time ago, it created a problem with  the gamepads buttons not registering. A highly popular example, both L and R Triggers, the kick button, in this case "B". and it just made the game unplayable. There was from the Devs of a patch that would fix this, but that day seem to have never come. I haven't tried online due to the gampad issue, but from what I hear, it isn't too great. It's sad to say that I'll probably be refunding this game sometime soon, spend my money on something that isn't broken.\n","December 29, 2015","false","21.9"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","20","30","2","0"

I buy the game, and then I'm expected to buy content that's literally three-times the cost of the game I just bought in order for me to feel like I get the full experience and options. That's literally disgusting. I feel violated as a consumer. The outrageous EARLY-RELEASE-DLC prices, plus the way I know the Publisher/Developer is treating the community of modders, can only lead me to speculate that these idiots don't care about anything except for loading their wallets, while carrying complete disregard for customer-satisfaction. Here's a fun fact: Tecmo actually came out and said that they used fan-inspired artwork for some of their costume-packs. This further discourages me from telling anyone to buy this game. Why? I'll answer with a question of my own; how is it, that it is ok to take fan-inspired work, and sell it for ridiculous sums of money, but it's not ok for fans to share their own ideas for the game with each other, FOR FREE? In Tecmo's head, I feel like the only answer is that they cannot monopolize on such activity. Disgusting behavior. Absolutely disgusting. I know there are a lot of other reasons this port isn't good either, but the way Tecmo has been treating the PC community just felt so disrespectful-- I just had to put my two cents in.

Firstly, it lacks two stages and the soft engine which is simply unacceptable, but I was prepared for it and I was prepared to ignore it.\n\nThe lack of options to change controls on keyboard is horrendous.

You can bind the actions on your controller but the game would not recognize the triggers on my controller. There also seems to be a bit of input delay I havent experienced in any other game with the controller but it makes the counter and block systems even more of a pain in the ♥♥♥ to use.\n\nAs far as content goes, the story mode takes a couple hours at most to beat and is mostly cutscenes. Skipping a cutscene also takes you to another cutscene instead of directly to the next fight. The best thing in this game was how much they added in the tutorial and combat practice. There is actually more practice material than singleplayer content.\n\nVisuals in the game are a little dated but the game overall doesnt look too bad. Things like the sweat and dirt accumulating during a fight are nice on the cinematics but during gamepaly I almost never noticed them making it a useless feature. Options and settings in this game are horrendous as well. The only graphical options are turning off sweat, dirt, and how jiggly the breast physics are. The game starts in window mode and the options for resolution are limited.\n\nThis hasn't introduced much into the franchise that previous games didnt have and its doing nothing new in the genre. Overall its a good casual fighter to play with freinds and perhaps the online will be decent enough to make me revist this occasionally but as it stands now I would not reccomend picking it up unless it gets a decent sale.","June 18, 2015","false","3.5"," 23 of 37 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","23","37","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/savagewalrus/recommended/311730/","savagewalrus","Savage Walrus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/savagewalrus/","54 products in account","TL;DR = It's a good game with fun characters and mechanics that went wrong on PC especially given it's the ONLY version with no lobbies. Too many missing features, delays out the wazoo, and poor relations with the PC community will leave especially older fans feeling neglected. I can't give this version a recommend verdict at least until this version gets fair and equal treatment to its new gen console counter-parts - which I would give a recommend verdict for.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n*buys console version*\nTN: Thanks for buying our game! We value you. Here's everything we promised and more! What's that? You already have Ultimate on last gen? Here! Upgrade your game for free!\n\nMe: I love you, Team NINJA! I can't wait to enjoy our time together and let you meet all my friends!\n\n*buys Steam version*\nTN: Here's the foundation for the game. Mechanics are still there. We didn't put in a lot of the new stuff we know a lot of people buy this for though or a proper online. Progress? Ehhhh, we'll get around to it... eventually... maybe... or just never. Who knows! So so so sorry. In the mean time, have some more over priced costume bundles that you can only buy in bundles.\n\nMe: . . . What? You're kidding, right?\n\nTN: Nope, f*** you.\n\nMe: This isn't working out. You weren't who I thought you were. I want a divorce.\n\nBut seriously, it REALLY pains me to not recommend this version of the game. I hate doing this because I'm a long time big fan of DoA games since 2005-ish. I absolutely love DOA fighters, but because of the half effort shown with this release, that might change now. This may be my final game purchased from Team NINJA after seeing their attitude to Steam players. I may change this to a positive review if/when things turn around, but for now, I gotta be honest here. Dammit, this port is half baked! I trusted Team NINJA to do the right thing, and they haven't. That's the bottom line here.\n\nOn a postive note, this game is an excellent fighting game for it's mechanics and fun characters with tons of moves, - but I highly recommend the console versions at least for now due to this version missing too much. All the great mechanics and characters of this game are still here in this game's version though. There's also the obvious hardware advantage for the PC version like modding, playing at 4k, and using your own music - but that's kinda standard and expected really on PC games in general. Hardware advantages are really the only good thing about this version which to be honest has almost nothing to do with the game itself, right? Right.\n\nNow for the negatives: Missing many features new gen consoles got including stages. Fully supported Online is delayed AGAIN (it may never be complete at this rate). Other blanacing and general bug patches the consoles get we also get delayed. DLC is delayed, and yes, you can ONLY buy them in bundles that often cost more than the game itself. We're stuck with a crash happy rank battles that select your opponent semi-randomly, and is the ONLY version with NO lobbies where you can set up your own match rules and invite friends. I REPEAT; THIS VERSION IS THE ONLY VERSION WITH NO LOBBY MATCHES. The game sometimes crashes inconsistently. You can't invite friends to play at all, and just have to hope you get lucky and find them in rank random crash-a-lot mode. Graphical effects are closer to the ps3 version than new gen especially with textures. Oh, and don't get me started on their treatment to the PC community and the modding community in how they basically almost decided to shun us completely. I'm so angry with you, Team NINJA, because I know you CAN do better, and I expected better as a long time fan. This was horrible for your reputation!\n\nAnd for those that choose not to acknowledge the painfully obvious flaws in this port, but would rather dismiss it or apologize for the company that screwed you over to make a quick buck with a rushed delievery, SHAME ON YOU! Now, that doesn't mean just anyone that recommends the game. In fact, I probably would have made this verdict "recommended" if AT LEAST online was properly finished. I'm talking about those that act like there is NO elephant in the room when they know damn well missing features, massive delays, and poor support are real issues, and it didn't HAVE to be. Tecmo is not some new company that doesn't know what it's doing. There's no room for excuses for such big mistakes from a big company.

I was so mistaken. Where to begin?\n\nGraphics are okay. I like them. But knowing that it uses the PS3 graphics instead of the improved PS4 ones, shows a lack of care coming from the devs.\n\nThe overpriced DLCs. Sure, those are optional content, simple eyecandy; but most of them have this tag: 'Outfit damage not available in Steam version' Really?

Then, towards launch, news kept flooding in about this not having the same stages and features as their console counter-parts. As a result I held off on buying it until a Steam Summer Sale in order to try it for myself.\n\nGood news is that this thing can actually work well on lower end pcs and laptops.\n\nBad news is everything else. There is no achievement support. THERE WILL BE NO ONLINE SUPPORT FOR ANOTHER WEEK. And better yet, the only way to mod-in the stages TK left out is to illegally pirate the game, meaning that those who paid are stuck on the bad end. There is also an issue where this weird ♥♥♥ filter is put over the game, which is not present in the console versions, and the only way to make it look normal, once again, is to download a cracked version after you've already paid for it!\n\nFor instance, there are some cool mods like Tekken and Shenmue costumes that work for various characters. However due to TK's openly hostile approach to PC users, it won't work in vanilla!\n\nHopefully another 3D fighter comes to Steam and puts this game to shame.\n\nEdit: I was asked to update this so I will very briefly:\n\nAchievements work. So I'll give a standing ovation for that. Truly a pariah among developers.\n\nOnline is horrible and hackers are using trainers there on day one.\n\nSo, once again, I reccomend anyone who likes 3D fighters, or hell just DoA in general, to NOT buy this feature incomplete game.","June 22, 2015","false","2.1"," 22 of 37 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","22","37","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eruditus/recommended/311730/","Eruditus","Eruditus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eruditus/","147 products in account","Dead or Alive 5 Last Round is a Fighting Game (if you can't already tell).  Although, personally I think it has as much as if not more to offer than other fighting games on Steam.\n\nFirstly, let's start off with what modes are available:\n\nIn Dead or Alive there are plenty of modes that you can play, So I'm sure you'll find one that tickles your pickle or floats your boat..\n\nStory ModeThis is quite obvious, this is a story mode that's split up in to 72 chapters, and then each chapters are split up into characters. So you get to grips with most of the characters in the game. The story continues from Dead or Alive 4, but if you are a newcomer it's not too confusing. For me personally I enjoyed the story mode even though it was short, about 4 hours. But the story isn't where the most fun is..\n\nWhere the most fun is in the game is, shock horror! The fighting section. Surprising, I know...\n\nFightHere we have the "Fight" section of the game:\nThere are many options to choose from and each has their own flair.\nVersus\nArcade\nTime Attack\nSurvival\nTeam FightVersus\nHere it's the player vs CPU or another player offline. You can use controller or keyboard for each player. If playing against the CPU you also have the option of changing the settings.\n\nOptions include:\nComputer Level (from 1[easiest]-8[hardest])\nMax Health (From Smallest to Largest)\nRounds (Up to 5)\nTime Limit (Split into 30/40/50/60/99 or No Limit)In this mode you can also do tag team mode, against the CPU or a friend offline(but we all know you don't have any xP).\n\nArcade\nArcade is split into Solo and Tag matches, the idea here is you pick a character (or 2 for tag) and battle your way through a random set of opponents. In these matches you get points depending on how well you play and at the end a score is amassed and put on the leaderboard (which is local to your PC).\n\nIn arcade arcade mode there are 8 difficulty levels they span from Rookie to Legend\n\nTime Attack\nTime attack is similar to arcade mode, you pick solo or tag match, pick your character and difficulty level and battle through a set of opponents. Only, this time it's not score that's your main concern. It's time. You have to try and beat all your opponents in the shortest time possible and then your score is put on the (again offline) leaderboard.\n\nSurvival\nAgain like Time attack and Arcade before it, Survival has similar properties (Solo/Tag team, difficulties). But here you have to try and last as long as possible and amass points. The fights are endless until you lose.\n\nTeam Fight\nFinally we come to Team Fight, here you pick a team up to 7 characters and fight your opponent be it CPU or a friend offline.\nYou have the same settings options as Versus (Com Level, Max Health,Time Limit).\n\nTrainingIn this section of the game, it's here to help you hone your skills so you can truly say "I'm a fighter".\n\nIt's split into:\nFree Training\nCommand Training\nTutorial\nCombo Challenge\nFree Training\nIn this mode you as usual can pick tag or solo mode. Then you are put into whatever stage you want and have a CPU (or a second controller) which you can use to train against. There are many options like you can set the CPU to do A high/mid/low strike, Set their CPU Level [1-8], even make them walk round you in endless circles so you can dance together :D\n\nCommand Training\nHere you can learn all the basic moves for each Character and can track your progress via a percentage displayed when choosing a character. It's pretty self explanatory really.\n\nTutorial\nThe tutorial is a tutorial. But, seriously in the tutorial there are 42 sections which teach you all the basic game mechanics you'll ever need to know. There are 42 parts which include mini tests for you to show off your skill (or lack thereof).\n\nCombo Challenge\nThis is where you really get to grips with characters. Here there are many combos for you to learn for each character and they're set out in a similar fashion to the tutorial. A handy feature here is that you can choose to repeat the combo until you get it perfect.\n\nAh, finally the review is ov..Wut? There's more?!\n\nOnlineHere, unfortunately, is where the game starts to go sour. In the online mode there's not a lot of content. You have ranked match, ranked match and everyone's favourite; ranked match. There's also a leaderboard so you can gloat to your friends about how you're great at using a bot online to beat unsuspecting players...\n\nThe ranked matches are simple.  You can search for a solo or a tag match. You can specify region; Any/Same/Nearby\nThen you can specify opponent's strength min/max which ranges from LR all the way up to Diamond. and finally there's an option "Previous Opponent OK", which tells the game whether you're ok fighting the previous opponent or not.\n\nIn the ranked mode you get points for defeating your opponents in a match and lose points for losing a match. What dictates how much you win is; your rank, your opponent's rank, whether either player has a win streak and the loss streak wither player has. In the ranked matches the stages are randomly picked and the matches are first to 3. That's sort of a setback as you can't customise your match like offline. There also aren't any lobbies, so if you want to play this game with friends that might be a challenge.\n\nSpectator\nIn spectator mode you get to creep on your opponents in matches you've saved or better yet pit 2 AI against each other and creep on them :D. You can enter photo mode and pause/play the footage, zoom in, change the focus and switch which character the game focuses on. Photos you take are saved as screenshots on Steam and can be uploaded to the Steam Cloud.\n\nMovies\nHere you can watch all the story mode videos, character win/lose poses and private paradise videos (if you have that DLC) you've unlocked.\n\nTitles\nHere you can look at all the titles you've unlocked and set them as your title card which is displayed online in Ranked matches. There are a total of 999 titles so there's plenty to do there.\n\nMiscellaneous StuffGraphics Options:\nResolution\nShadows\nAnti Aliasing\nFullscreen/Windowed\nMiscellaneous Issues:\nNo support from them on the Steam forums whatsoever.\nCertain controllers/arcade sticks not being supported with no intention of them updating the game either.  Also, Good keyboard support? = No\n\nKeep in mind the PC version of this game is also missing the following from the PS4/Xbox One release:\n-Online Lobbies\n-Soft Engine;\nAdvanced particle effects\n"Advanced" breast physics\nSubsurface Scattering3 Stages;The Crimson\nDanger Zone\nFireworks\nSo if you are looking for the definitive version of the game, look elsewhere (PS4).\n\nHowever, if you are looking for a game which:\nContains less than the PS4 counterpart but cost more\nIs fun\nIs 3D and involves fighting\nHas a large character roster with diverse fighting styles and less diverse breast sizes\nHas lots of single/local multi- player capabilities\nDoesn't contain those fancy PS4 grafix\nLove massive DLC packs that cost a lot,\nYou can't play with friends in (not because you don't have any ;_; because the online doesn't allow it ;;_;;)\nDoesn't get a lot of support\nHas a relatively small online community\nContains ZackThen you've come to the right place!!\n\nOverall, personally, I really enjoy the game. So I would recommend the GAME on its merits but not so much the port and the (lack of) customer service that it has","November 8, 2015","true","231.5"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","23","39","2","8"

This one is one of those games! If you've played DOA before or DOA5 on consoles, there isn't much that can be said about the game. However if you are planning to get it on PC, be prepared for some serious issues. Assuming you've managed to overlook them all, you may find some fun out of it, but my best advice would be to wait for a steam sale to get this game.\n\nThe bad:\nAll things you would expect on a PC game are not supported. Seriously, just read the game description/read the reviews/videos on it. That's pretty much it! Nothing more to add to that.\n\nThe good:\nFinally DOA on PC/Steam after so long.\n\nThe UGLY:\nGame cost 39.99 or 35.99 on preorder. Bunch of outfits in a bundle cost 54.99 and 64.99!\n\nVerdict:\nWTF is wrong with game publishers/developers? Publishers are a**holes who don't know how to please their customers and just want money. Developers develop games ON PC FOR CONSOLES, yet when they put it back for PC, they fail miserably. If these are developers who write programmes in games, I don't know how they even got their job. I sometimes wonder, if they would have any job had it not been the consoles that are lowering their programming skill. Or is it that they are just too lazy to work on their damn coding?\n\nAnyway. Save the trouble. Wait for (finger crossed) some patches and/or steam sale if you really want to play the game on PC. I'm sure with it's current rating, the price for the game and its stupid outfit bundles will drop fast enough for eveyrone to grab in not so far future.\n","March 30, 2015","false","4.3"," 40 of 72 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","40","72","2","0"

The game has no problems running at a constant 60fps and from what I've read it works well on lower end rigs too. The problem is that the developers decided to charge PC users for a next-gen version of the game and then give them the PS3 equivilent instead.  As it stands it uses the PS3 versions effects and is missing the improved 'soft engine' that the PS4 version uses to improve the skin quality of the characters. On top of this there are 2 complete arena's missing that the PS4 got also, the developers have stated that these missing features will never be added to the PC version of the game.\n\nNext problem we have is the promised online mode, this was supposed to have been implemented within 3 months of the games initial release but as of writing this its still nowhere to be found. There is a beta version of the online component you can use to tide you over but its completely bare bones and seldom works anyway, fights either lose their connection mid-way or suffers from lag so extreme that its completely unplayable.\n\nLast but not least is the extremely overpriced DLC, there's several packs of costumes (which provide nothing other than asthetics) which cost more than the actual game itself, it costs literally hundreds to buy them all and to add insult to injury the breakable clothes component from the PS4 version is missing as well.\n\nIf you're a fan of the series and you can grab it on sale and you're not bothered about the missing graphics, features or online mode then there's plenty of single player modes to play and costumes to unlock to keep you occupied, for me though it simply isn't good enough to be expected to pay for a next-gen game and instead be presented with a half-♥♥♥♥♥ port from a years old gaming system and still have no online mode to boot. I'm a big fan of the series and think it has a lot of potential but to be honest I'm just glad I got it on sale as I'd be pretty miffed if I'd paid full price for what in reality is the PS3 version of the game.","September 12, 2015","false","28.4"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","13","21","0","0"

Hopefully they will release smaller packs or even individual costumes in the future...\n\nAll in all, the port performs well. Keeping a steady 60fps during gameplay and a steady 30fps during cutscenes (they're capped at 30 for some reason...), the game looks great and its heaps of fun versing others online!\n\n7.5/10 (+1.5 if soft engine is implemented, extra stages added and textures improved as per next gen console versions, +0.5 if DLC is broken up into smaller packs)\n\nKeep in mind this review is just my opinion. it is likely your views on the port are different to mine :)\nThat being said, the dev doesn't seem to give a damn about the PC community so really... dont expect much support from them","April 8, 2015","true","170.8"," 64 of 119 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","64","119","0","0"

The mechanics are the strongest they've ever been in the series and the cast is very diverse and unique, even the males are interesting even though they're overshadowed by the girls. People love the TnA\n\nThe major downsides of the port at the time of this reivew is no online at launch, but hopefully that'll be remedied soon. Assuming it runs well the game should really pick up.\n\nMost negitive reviews here are just complaining about the DLC. Anyone who expected the costume catalog that team ninja has built since the games original release (2012) to be free has no experience with these types of things. While it would be nice, it would completely undermine their own profits. Buying the costumes add nothing to the game other then your own visual stimulation.  They could have divided them up more efficently, but having them in the chunks isn't so bad either. I'd be interested in seeing the cost between versions of the games.\n\nOne major downside is no soft engine/new stage from the Xbox One and Playstation 4 versions, but I can excuse that since adding them likely would kill weaker machines without deep optimization.  I've been a fan of the series this the first game, DOA5LR is the best version hands down. Not all fighting games can actually continue to improve and impress with each new version.\n\nPros:\n-Wonderful character design on the entire roster\n-Unique 3d fighting system you won't find elsewhere\n-Diverse and destructable stages\n-Large varity of characters with a large varity of costumes for each\n-Will run on mediocer PCs\n-MOD SUPPORT-\n\nCons:\n-No soft engine\n-DLC pricing for costume sets can be a turn off (but all characters are included)\n-No online at launch\n\nWhen online launches I'll edit this with more details.\n\ntl;dr Best DOA yet, haters are just people ♥♥♥♥♥ing about COSMETIC ONLY dlc, no online yet though.","April 23, 2015","true","21.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","1"

I did have to disable my Logitech G13 to make this game work past the previous menu point.\n\nHowever, I found once in a fight, the default control schemes A, B, C, and D all have limited functions. As such, A only allows someone to punch and crouch. I have to use a custom control scheme to make it work, and it follows the default A scheme closely/exactly, but I have to remove the tag command and thus cannot fight a tag match AND be able to swap characters mid fight. I have to let one die before the other fights, unless I want to go into the menue, change the controls, swap the characters, and redo the entire process.\n\nThe gameplay as of now is "Meh" but enjoyable, but not worth the frustration for the price at almost any discount.

(at 1080p) I honestly don't care about DLC costumes, and I'm financially stable, but even I think $60+ for costumes is too much. I understand if people want to show their love and support for a game through DLC but it's overpriced. While I understand setting up online may take a while, I don't understand why various parts of the game were removed. We lack 2 stages and the Soft Engine. This is a port of a console, so I wasn't expecting better graphics, but I certainly was NOT expecting worse. Finally, the default keybinding on keyboard is acceptable and makes sense, but I would like to see binding options.\n\nIn conclusion, I can still have fun with this game, and that's what's important. The devs may have gimped out on serveral settings, but the core element is still there. I enjoyed DoA since it came out on xbox 360 and I can experience the same fun now on pc.

If I use it in ChImp mode, I have to use the first button on the top(or 1P) as the confirm button, the first button on the bottom(or 1K) becomes cancel.  With every other fighter, 1K and 2K are confirm and cancel.\n\nIt gets worse with an Xinput controller.  The pause button isn't start, it's bound to the right stick(which you have to press down).  That may not be too bad if you're using an Xinput pad but if you're using an Xinput arcade stick you don't have a pause button.\n\nThis could easily be fixed if Team Ninja were to make a patch that allows you to bind everything like Ultra Street Fighter IV on PC allows, but they won't do that.  And because of that I don't recommend this game.","March 10","false","8.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The potentially good successor to DoA series finally getting PC release results in total failure after a year since its release date having zero to none fixes at all.\n\nFirst things first - yes, it has been a year since release. One would expect fully functioning game with few or no glitches at all, right? Wrong. Bindings - what's that? Not only you can't rebind a single key mapped for keyboard (don't know about joystick though) the layout has been imagined by somebody smoking bad crack!\n\nContinuing: Multiplayer? Glitched as ♥♥♥♥ (read - not working). LAN? What's that? Costume DLCs twice as expensive as the game itself for not working game? You have them.\n\nThe only good thing is the visuals which are quite good as DoA usually is but again... that is if you go solo (career play).\nIn addition - loading times... I do not think there is any reason for characters to load so long in character selection menu. PCs are not consoles.\n\nAs much as I hate to say it - for DoA:LR PC release is drab and those who ported it did really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ job.\n\nI do not recommend this title at all - everybody better off to watch just the gameplay on youtube or else but game is not worth not only money but even time.","March 22","false","6.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Oh how I love this game. Since DOA2U all the way up to DOA5U, I have enjoyed this series thoroughly and when I heard they were porting it to PC I was ecstatic. Oh and before you judge my playtime as credibilty, I have over 300 hours playtime on DOA5 and DOA5U, I've played enough to form an opinion of Last Round. Now that you know my background with the series and how much I enjoy it hopefully you will trust me when I say not to buy this game unless it's on sale. Why you may ask? Well lets get right down to that.\n\nDead or Alive 5 Last Round is the third and final installment of the orignal Dead or Alive 5. The second installment DOA5U added many features such as the ability to change the soundtrack and even the breast physics. There were new game modes such as Team Battle and the training mode was enhanced even more, making it easier to master your favourite characters. New stages, costumes and characters were also implemented. DOA5LR was meant to be the next gen version of DOA5U; whilst they were only adding 2 new stages and some new characters, the graphical improvement alone was worth the upgrade. Except the steam version isn't getting half of this.\n\nWanted those new next-gen graphics? Haha nope.\nWanted the remasters of 2 great stages in DOA? Haha nahhh.\nHow about even being able to run a PS3 game on max settings with a smooth 60fps? Better have a rig that costs £1000.\nOh you want a simple cloud saving system so you don't have to back up saves? Nope, too complicated.\nFancy a steam name change? Well prepare to lose all your save data.\nWant to play online with a friend? Not for the next 3 months you can't.\nMight as well rename it to Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate 2.0.\n\nAll of those and more... Yes. More. No longer are costumes being sold individually, or even in well managed sets! Team Ninja has gotten so greedy that they're now packing multiple sets in to huge DLC bundles which cost more than the bloody game itself! If you're like me and you bought costumes individually for £1 then you're probably going to have to stick with what comes with the game. Shame that... Really wanted Officer Marie Rose. Also please, if you in any way shape or form try to sympathise with this marketing scheme then you're absolutely deluded.\n\nFurthermore, chances of user created content being made for the game is very slim. Team Ninja threatened modders, stating that content they create should be "Moral" and if it's not then they will refuse another PC DOA release. Now I'm sorry but if by moral they mean nude mods then they need to get a grip. Lei Fang's pre-purchase costume literally ONLY covers her nipples. The real message TN was trying to get across is that they're worried that people will make costume mods thus making their content redundant. I'm sorry TN but even if they weren't any costume mods, I will not pay the price of a triple A game for some costumes. If you think they were worried about nude mods then ask yourselves this: Why are they holding competitions for players to make their own costumes? Surely we can just mod them in anyway? No. They want to sell our ideas back to us and if that doesn't disgust you along with all the other ♥♥♥♥-ups then you're part of the problem.\n\nTeam Ninja has neglected the PC release terribly. Examples of this can be seen in the way they advertised the game. Trailers showing all the content such as stages and graphics were on the steam page for this game before release. "Before release?" I hear you ask. Yes. They removed the trailer shortly after they announced that the PC version was not going to have half the features. They also refused to make any statements about why they have done what they've done and completely ignored anyone asking for answers about the PC release. Meanwhile they were happily promoting their £50 DLC packs on twitter and facebook whilst twiddling their thumbs.\n\nTeam Ninja also delayed this game for 6 weeks in order to give the "best experience possible." I'm sorry but this is not the best experience possible. Not only is the game missing all these features but it's not even optimised properly. I'm sorry but when I can run Battlefield 4 on ultra at 60fps but can't run a PS3 game at max, you know there's a problem. So yes, you will need an i7 to run this last gen port.\n\nI'm sorry if this was long but Team Ninja has really ♥♥♥♥ed up with this. I've lost all respect for the company and I'll be damned if I ever forgive them unless they update the game to be on par with the next-gen versions. Unfortunately it's already clear that we've been forgotten and we'll be lucky to even get character balance patches. Whilst this game is very fun and I'll probably still play it a lot seeing as I can't get an Xbone or a PS4, you shouldn't waste your money on it if you can afford to get it on a next-gen console. That or pick it up in a sale. And hey, if you must have your DOA like me, then just fricking wait for a sale PLEASE DEAR GOD. Maybe things will change once online is implemented and I can do a Team Ninja and falsely advertise the game to my friends so I have more people to play with.\n\nTL:DR: If you've never played a DOA then yeah get this game but if you played a lot of Ultimate and the orignal 5 either wait for a sale or get it on next-gen. Oh and to TN; get a grip and stop treating your customers like money makers.\n\nEDIT: I'd just thought I'd mention that there's a SweetFX preset for DOA5LR if you look in the guides section for this game on Steam. With a bit of tweaking you can make the game look ultra sexy! Whilst this doesn't excuse the abscence of PS4 graphics, it does make it look way better than a last gen port!.","March 31, 2015","false","57.9"," 27 of 50 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","27","50","4","1"

However, since then the game developers worked on the flaws and got Online to work! And I must say, this game is so beautiful and stylish, with no visual sacrifices it stays at 60-50 fps constantly.\n\nPeople say the port was a bad idea but it works absolutely fine, Just get SCP, plug in your PS2 controller and bam you're ready to go. Pretty simple.\n\nOnline mode isn't as popular as you may think but neither is Street Fighter's. If you play arcade or story mode then chances are you will find someone to play against, it will automatically tell you when someone's ready to fight and all you have to do is press a button and you'll vs each other. The ranking system is a bit weird but it's ok, but I wouldn't be too worked up over it.\n\nBesides, isn't it kind of just general knowledge now that when a game is released for early access, you DON'T buy it? Like come on, you'll ruin the game for yourself. That's a pattern of thought that most of the negative reviews have here, they were all people who bought the game when it was under construction.\n\nThe game is now, far more polished and there's a lot more to it.\nYes there's lots of DLC and it's a shame you can't just buy the costumes you want but the base game still has lots of costumes to choose from even without it.\n\nI absolutely love the DOA games and this is no exception, the fighting itself is far better than any of the games. The performance has been absolutely perfect. And it's a playable game even when you're not playing online. There's so much to do.\n\nAll the mechanics for characters and playing has been fine for me, I have had no issues or malfunctions with any of those options. And don't worry, if you play online you don't have to listen to the other person. Or at least, I never have!\n\nPROS\n---------------------------------\n-Fun Game Modes\n-Beautiful Scenery\n-Gorgeous characters and costumes\n-Story Mode has an interesting backstory behind it, more so than the other DOA games.\n-Online Mode is easy and generally you'll be able to vs a few people every day, sometimes it's usually the same people.\n-CONTROLLER SUPPORT, Triangle is punch, Circle is Kick etc... buttons are working fine!\n-Great FPS\n-Huge amount of variety in the characters and their fighting styles\n-Makes you feel energized and inspired to become more active, SERIOUSLY!\n-ACHIEVEMENTS ARE SUPPORTED!!!!!\n-Great Voice acting\n\nCONS\n------------------------------\n-Akira. ♥♥♥♥ that guy.\n-Not too many people Online which is sad :c\n-Lots of DLC, plus they're expensive (but you don't really have to buy them, they're just costumes)\n-Can't really record your fights well...\n-The Survival Mode isn't as good as it used to be. It goes Easy mode, survive 20 then on like Normal it's survive 50? Why not just do\n\nFor all the game is worth right now, it's a fair price. But most Negative or Positive reviews you will read now, are from before the game was finished on PC. It's now been fixed, there's basically no issues. Maybe you'll have difficulty with finding controller support so that's why you use SCP, an 'emulator' of sorts which identifies when you've plugged in a controller and then allows you to sort out the rest from there. If you can get that going, you will have no further issues with this game.\n\nThank you for reading!\n","December 15, 2015","true","31.2"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

Clearly they only put this on here to make a quick buck.","March 31, 2015","false","0.9"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","0"

The game is fun, the combat system has a *LOT* of depth and regardless of what minor features the console versions might have over the PC version, this *IS* the ultimate version of the game for one simple reason - it's an absolute showcase in stereo 3D (NVIDIA 3D Vision setup required) with my fix:\n\nhttp://helixmod.blogspot.com/2015/04/dead-or-alive-5-last-round.html","October 2, 2015","true","82.8"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","2"

We have no Tekken (yet), SoulCalibur, or Virtua Fighter, so as it stands the competition is near non existent. That is unless you count games like Naruto, which while good, are not really what I would call true competitive fighting games.\n\nDead or Alive 5 as a 3D fighting game is more than competent. It's fast. It's flashy. It's just fun to play. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nSure, this being Team Ninjas 2nd game to be ported to Steam, they are still showing they have a LOT to learn. I mean as far as ports go, this one is far from perfect. But it is not as broken as some say. It is missing some stuff. But the core gameplay is at this stage is excellent.\n\n\nWhat is missing?\nThe Danger Zone and Crimson stages which are PS4/XBOX One exclusive\nThe Soft Engine\nSome PS4 particle effects\nOnline mode (coming in the next 3 months)\nSupport for keyboard configuration\n\nThe only 2 things in that list I find a bit unacceptable would be the lack of online, which IS being patched in, and the keyboard configuration. Hopefully the KB configuration will be patched in later. Though I find for a 3D fighting game, that a controller works much better. And this game has controller support. But the other 3 things? I'm not going to whine and say this game sucks because of the lack of those things, like some people are doing. Why? Because I actually have enjoyed the game so far. And is that not what matters?\n\nAs for the game itself, Dead or Alive 5 is like a much faster and flashier Tekken and Virtua Fighter. A game that focuses mainly on hand to hand combat. It includes a basic fight system that consists of a punch, kick, grapple, and reversal button. It allows movement in all directions, with a basic side to side 2D movement as the primary, and an easy sidestepping as the alternate. Each of the 30+ characters has a wide array of moves and combos, and varying styles of fighting as to not have too many "duplicates" among characters. One of the big features of the DoA series is the reversal button, in which if you time and aim it right can reverse almost any move. But timing is the key. So people who master this move will obviously have a major advantage. The nice thing is that DoA very easy to learn. But DoA is also hard to master. It's a game you can play both casually and competitively and have fun either way.\n\nStages are the next big draw for the DoA series, as DoA is one of the first 3D fighting game seires to include multi-tiered fighting levels with breakable walls, or other hazards that knock players into new parts of the stage. And it looks absolutely fantastic when doing this. Like starting the fight on top of a balcony and knocking someone over the edge into a courtyard below, or smashing someone through a wall into the next room, and more like this.\n\nAnd of course, the absolute biggest draw (though some will be ashamed to admit it) for DoA is the costumes. And there are tons of them. If you did not preorder the game, you still get a massive assortment of costumes to select from for the 30+ characters. Yes, the costume DLC at this point is ridiculously overpriced, but I guess fans are going to pay what fans are going to pay. But none of it is required to get the most enjoyment out of the fighting portion of the game.\n\nAnyways, this is not really a review, but just me rambling, and looking for a way to give a thumbs up to this game. If you want a solid fighting game and prefer to game on your PC, and can wait a littloe bit for the online mode, get this. If you would rather have the soft engine, some better particles, and 2 extra stages (which are not even that great), by all means give the PS4/XBOX One versions a shot.\n\nI'll probably do an actual review for this once the online mode is up.","March 31, 2015","true","18.4"," 123 of 239 people (51%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","51","123","239","7","5"

First, I'm really dissappointed in team ninja for the giving PC gamers a passive aggresive middle finger. Scroll up and look at how much their charging you for DLC. It's just costumes. That's it. Just costumes and they're charging you $580.85 for all of them. I could buy a really nice graphics card with that money or an oculus rift.  I won't critisize them for not releasing online mode right away. It could be argued that they're giving you early access. That's fine, but when they did release it they only used a rank match. There is no lobby that you can go into. Matching with somebody sometimes takes 5-10 minutes and the match is over in less than 2. Then you're waithing another 5-10 minutes to play another match. The lobby on the console versions lets you rematch and play another person as long as you want. This is all you get and team ninja doesn't have any plans to fix or update this, but they're sure happy at updating you with new overpriced costume packs.  I'm not trying to condemn team ninja. They have a lot of talent and make amazing games. I love the Dead or Alive series and I love the Ninja Gaiden series. That's why I'm disappointed. They're completely disreguarding PC players as if they don't matter. It's a huge potential market that they're tossing to the side. The only reason I got this game is that I'm a of the series, but with all these problems it's as if they don't want you to buy it. I understand if you don't want to purchase it but if you do then don't pay full price for it.","January 31","true","47.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The pros end there. As for the cons, I would say that EVERYTHING ELSE IS A CON!!! Horrible keyboard and controller button layout that you have little to no control over, disgusting framedrops, dead online servers, low-resolution everything since it's a port of the PS3 version (being a downgrade compared to the PS4 version), overpriced costume DLC that doesn't give you the option to buy individual costumes, and a developing team that absolutely hates your guts for being a PC player. Team Ninja has given the PC version of DOA5 the biggest middle finger imaginable for the past few years. First, they purposefully delayed  online mode for THREE WHOLE MONTHS!!! Apparently this was a form of punishment for not playing in a " good moral and manner" (that's exactly how the translation from Team Ninja came out, so not my mistake). Apparently the R-18 mods was  what they were referring to, so the message was that they didn't want ANYONE to make R-18 mods. At all. Oh boy, this is by far the most hypocritical thing I have ever heard from Team Ninja, the developers who are infamously known for making games about scantily-clad women beating the s*** out of each other. The developers who  are known for their revolutionary advances in game technology, hence the improvement in breast and sweat physics. The developers who are known for changing the ages of underaged women to 18 in order to avoid backlash from the west. The developers who are known for making a bad volley ball games purely for the sex-appeal of women in bikinis with tan-lines (I'm looking at you Dead Or Alive Xtreme 3). I could go on and on, but you get the point. Team Ninja should just accept reality, and realize that these kinds of things are inevitable with PC, but instead, they threw a massive fit towards the PC community. Yeah, good job Team Ninja (-_-). Second, they refused to patch a large amount of game breaking bugs for a long time, thus making the PC port of DOA5 a broken mess. The game is in a better state, but not much of an improvement. Third and lastly, despite the death of the DOA5 PC community, they still insist on releasing overpriced COSTUME PACKS!!!! 422 U.S. dollars worth of costume packs as of the day this review was written. I'm okay with costume packs an all, but the fact that you can't buy individual costumes is absolutely appalling. This lack of choice forces you to buy a whole costume set for characters you didn't want, and the absolute minimum you can spend is 23 U.S. dollars. Goes to show just how greedy Team Ninja is. Overall, this port is a lost cause. If you wanna play DOA5, buy it on PS4. This is not the version for you.","March 28","false","9.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Not only did I preorder this game as soon as I built this PC, but it was going to be my most played game; my catalyst back into the fighting game realm which I had strayed from for too long.

And I was really looking forward to playing ranked and actually trying to climb that ladder......  But oh how Team Ninja failed on this title.  I won't even go into all the garbage that comes with this game; just check out all the other negative reviews on Steam or do an internet search on why this game is so terrible for PC as opposed to PS4.\n\nAnd just when I thought this game couldn't get any worse, I bought a new monitor; shiny ASUS RoG 27" 1440p 144hz monitor.

If you're looking for a deep fighting game to play off line every now and again, the game will deliver.  Every character has a huge list of moves you can learn and practicing will definitely improve your game.  The graphics are good enough.  The game is perfect for stereoscopic (e.g. 3D Vision) users with the action taking place right at the range where eye triangulation works best and a small modification will push the interface out of the screen to prevent most of the depth crossing.\n\nYes, the DLC is vastly overpriced but it's also not needed - the game comes with plenty of costumes and none of the DLC does anything other than add cosmetics.  Yes, it's got stability issues, especially in story mode but the game autosaves frequently so it isn't like you're going to lose hours of play (plus story mode is pretty horrible anyway).  Yes, the XBOX:One and PS4 got more features - so what?  I want a game, not something to wave in front of console gamers to show my superiority.  There's more than enough in our version to make a fun game.\n\nSo yeah - if you want to have some fun with a single player fighting game and would rather fight with buxom babes than watch somebody's head get ripped off and the blood drank, this is a good one.

Dont get me wrong the gameplay is not bad and can be fun but Engine is not optimise for PC, graphices are from  the PS3 version, lesser stages.\n\nBut the worst thing is game was out in March 2015 and now in December the same year we still dont have any proper updates on improved engine/ keyrebinding. Because of the bad release and no Dev support the PC communite is more or les dead.

I totally agree that it is the biggest letdown.

I played this game back in the 360   and it was really good. The game is really good fast and responsibe me and my buddies (army) play it almost everyday. If I could say something negative about the game is that characters should have more winning poses. Besides that the game is fast and responsive (running on a asus x550z, not a gamers PC). With the combo challenge mode you'll be a great player with some practice, the game as a really huge lineup of characters including some great characters from Virtua Fighter, also introduces at some new ones which are really good like Honoka.

I PRESS M ON MY KEYBOARD AND I'M STUCK THERE. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HORRIBLE PORT. I CAN'T EVEN PLAY IT... SERIOUSLY!\n\nUpsate (08/25/15)\nOkay I beilieve I should give more of a proper review rather than a simple rant.\nThe gameplay is solid and I have spent hours on trying to unlock all the costomes available by playing the arcade multiple times. It is fun and I enjoy the gameplay. The characters are not too complicated to  pick up and play. The girls are still sexy. So far the game is great if it wasn't for the many things that is wrong with it in the first place, which brings me to the bad.\nThe main problem right now is that there is still no online play, the game has been on the Steam Market for many months now that it still doesn't have online multiplayer. Supposedly there was a beta test a while back but it soon got taken down and TK announced there was going to be another delay and this time without a timeframe. My second issue is that there are problems using controllers for this game. Using any controller seems to have problems with mapping. For me the Right stick button seems to be the START button.\n\nSo overall I will still give this game a thumbs down and that's because of Tecmo Koei's fault. They seem to have abandoned this game, I assume in retaliation over the nude mods that appeared on PC just a few weeks after the games release even after TK said no no no to that kind of modding. So I highly doubt we'll ever see DOAX3 on PC or any of the previous titles that's for sure.\nSo overall I will only recommend this game for people that are huge fans of the game but don't buy it at full price.... buy it half off or less.","March 31, 2015","false","28.0"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","8","14","2","0"

I've had the game since release and while it was somewhat disappointing earlier on, overtime and after several patches it has gotten a lot better now so here is a more updated take on things.\n\nYes, we're missing ps4/xb1 features, yes the online could be more robust, and yes there is an obnoxious amount of obnoxiously overpriced dlc (my opinion at least).\n\nBUT setting aside expectations and comparisons....\n\nWhat we do have here is still one of the best fighting games on PC. At least on my computer, the game runs beautifully and looks very colorful and pretty. Gameplay is very smooth and I personally enjoy the mechanics and pacing of it. - imo more enjoyable than MK. There is a huge number of characters and costumes already included, a very indepth tutorial mode with lots of ways to practice, and a pretty good selection of regular game modes.\n\nThere is also a lot of customizable music tracks dating back across all DOAs that you can setup any way you wish. I think something like over 100 tracks and most of them sound great.\n\nI think you pretty much need a controller to properly enjoy this and my 360 controller works just fine. I've remapped some buttons from the game's menu to my liking (because I think the default configuration is kind of clunky) and it's very intuitive now. There is also a pretty large modding scene if you're into that, but you can't play online with mods.\n\nI've sunk in about 80 hours into this so far since release and it doesn't get boring. The action is mindless, fastpaced and fun and a great game diversion for when you're looking to kill a little time. So while yes, the game could have been so much more, what we have here is still a very enjoyable PC fighter if you're looking for one.","December 23, 2015","true","97.2"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

I think that the developers could've handled the whole thing much better, but I can't say I'm unhappy.  I've liked the DOA franchise for years, and when I preordered the game, I was just happy to see it on PC. I stopped gaming on consoles some years ago.\n\nI've seen how upset many people are about the game, and I wanted to clarify a few things:\n\nIt is just as fun as I remember it. I haven't had a single issue with the game yet, I know a lot of people have, but I've had absolutely no problems. If you're worried about this, you should probably do some research on your own to see if your PC matches the ones that have had issues. My wired xbox 360 controller worked as soon as I started up the game, no input lag so far, everything's good.\nThe visuals required a bit of tweaking on my part, but it was very simple. First, I used the game's config tool to make it look good, and recently I applied an FX mod that has made it look even better. For all I know, maybe there will be even more user-created content in the future to make things better yet. That is one of the best parts of PC gaming.\n\nTL;DR\nI'm not saying that there's no reason to be angry over the missing features. I am just trying to make it clear for people considering purchasing that the game looks nice, is very fun, and is definitely easier to jump into than other fighters. I always wanted to have my favorite fighting game on my PC, and this delivered for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tatsuhoshi/recommended/311730/","Tatsuhoshi","Tatsuhoshi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tatsuhoshi/","3071 products in account","Let me start this off by saying that I own this game for both the XBox360 and the PS3.  While a lot of people are rating this game negatively, it is not because of the aspects of the game itself.\n\nSo, first of all, Dead or Alive is a long-standing 3D arcade fighter hailing from the original Playstation.  It's claim to fame was filling a gap left vacant by a lack of Battle Arena Toshinden titles on that generation of consoles, and it's primary competition was Tekken, which was very mixed as to whether it was considered good or not.  What drew most people's attention back then were innovative features.  The first was battlegrounds that responded to the actions of the character.  Knocking an enemy into a mine in a minefield or into a laser fence did extra damage.  The second feature of note of the original game was boob physics.  This was actually its primary selling point, at the time, because no other game had done it at this point (that wasn't a hentai game on pc, at any rate).\n\nFast-forward many years and DoA has gone through a lot of changes, but has been relatively true to its original concept and has even managed to expand on it.  Make no mistake, this is a fan-service title in every respect of the term.  Men have rippling muscles, women have beautiful aesthetics, skimpy outfits for both genders (as well as some silly ones); even the scenes and battlezones are right out of an otaku's wet dream.  But underneath all of this is, actually, a very solid fighting game with a very good understanding of the martial arts used by the characters.  For those of you who are looking for the more mature aspects of this title, there's plenty of 'barely there' outfits for botht he male and female characters.  The characters also sweat and get dirty as you fight, affecting both clothes and skin.\n\nWhere this game excels:\nThis game benefits greatly from the hardware available to it on a good pc.  While the specs are a little high, you will be rewarded for the fantastic visuals of this title.\nThe fighting mechanics that drive the game are very fluid and solid.  Motions look largely natural aside from the clearly impossible wire-fu attacks of some characters, and the battles will just about always be intense and worthwhile.\nA wide variety of genders, fighting styles, and character costumes will give most people plenty of replay value and time.\n\nWhere this game is lacking;\nThe AI for the game is notorious, across all of the series and every platform, of blatantly cheating, and this is no exception.\nTiming for counters is very unforgiving.  While the AI has the capacity to do this flawlessly, you will probably be far less adept at this.\nStun locks and air juggles are a bit too common for my liking, but this is no different than the console version, and has been something that has become increasingly 'unfriendly' about this game since DoA4.\nThis game is a little heavy resource-wise.  You'll need a fairly decent computer to run everything smoothly, but if you've got that system, you will be richly rewarded with a beautiful game with beautiful men and women.\n\nThings that people complain about that aren't really a thing:\nNo multiplayer:  Granted, this is a bit of a pain, but this is something that will be patched into te pc title a few months after release, so it's not really that it has no multiplayer as much as it simply does not have it, yet.  We WILL have multiplayer, just not right out the gate.\n\nNot using the render engine of the XBOne and the PS4:  Once again, while this is true, this is a relatively minor issue.  We don't know what technical issues there were during the port, but I'm going to assume that the developers were having too many issues with the engine for the consoles and decided to go 'tried and true' to make sure that everyone on PC would have a good and solid experience.  Therefore, since this is saving headaches and ensuring playability with minimal loss of performance, this is not an issue.\n\nMissing extra content:  This is something that is going to be patched in over time.  Some of the features not included had things involved in them that used the features of the 'Soft Engine' that caused the delay of the port in the first place.  As they work out these issues, that additional content will be patched back into the game.  They may even, eventually, release an overhaul of the game using the Soft Engine at a later point, but we don't know for certain what will and won't be patched in.  Even still, grand scheme of things, we are missing two stages....whoopedy doo.....   This is a very minor issue considering that you have a completely playable game otherwise.  We even have some costume content that the console users didn't get, or at least don't get for free.","March 30, 2015","true","32.5"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","2"

DLC is overpriced when all they are is costumes, two levels are missing and the keyboard keys can't be re-binded. there are no achievements and no steamworks.\n\nAs a result I CAN'T RECOMMEND this game in its current state.  If the game gets updated graphics to at least the PS4 version and gets the online in it will be a good purchase for the fighting enthusiast, until then however don't buy this unless it's in a sale. It's cheaper and probably wiser to get Mortal Kombat 9 or any other fighter than this in its current form.  I would change this review if it gets updated.\n","April 1, 2015","false","7.4"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","15","28","2","0"

Why are you neglecting the steam version so much and ask even for a bigger price?> it would also be great to have dlc with different content and not only clothes\n\n- voices of Virtua Fighter characters could have matched better with DoA voices, sounds very arcadeish while DoA characters do not > good for fans of the VF series but it does sound strange\n\nmy gaming experience so far:\n\ni dont have a gamepad/ controller for my pc yet so i cannot judge controller experience, as i mentioned the keyboardcontrolls are set and cant be changed yet which is not convinient. Other hardware or technical issues shall be discussed in forums since i only can speak for\n\nmy system\nOS: Windows 7 Home Premium,\nCPU Intel Core i3 2120 3,3Ghz, 4GB physical RAM ,\nAMD Radeon HD 7450\n\nI definately could have a better graphic card but the game runs fluently. No real bugs discovered in the main game only the usual glitches you might already be familiar with like hair or clothes glitches.\nOnline mode suffers from ocassional crashes and network errors not only for me but for many others too.\nI believe the timing of counter attacks are a little harder to achieve but it could be due to different controlls on keyboard.\n\nBEWARE the DIFFERENCE between the PC and the CONSOLE version!\n\nFor pc gamers without xbox one/ PS4\nI can recommend the game if you are looking for a pc fighting game with good graphics and some sexy girls. If you dont currently care about onlinelobbies, this title will offer you  very interactive arenas and a huge list of combos, throws, holds and what not.\nA lot of moves have been reworked from previous titles of the franchise and grant you a lot of action: Problematic however is that not every gamepad is supported and Keyboard settings are fixed and cant be changed at present.\n\nHowever if you are a big fan of the franchise and a dlc collector and own either a PS4 or XBox One buy that version since i cannot recommend the Steam port. Iit is heavily neglected by devs. The game feels like an additional money bag and Team Ninjas pc experimantal zone. The PS 4/ XBox One gets way more attention by TN, probably a marketing strategy to promote the sale of consoles. There is more exclusive content and a better online mode on the console version.\n\nIf you want to stay up to date and join a nice new group please visit http://steamcommunity.com/groups/deadoralive5\nTechnical help will be provided as good as possible","April 9, 2015","true","66.4"," 25 of 48 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","25","48","0","0"

And honestly graphic on PS3 never was realy bad at all.

Basically if you want interesting moves & combos you would be much better served with any of the Guilty Gears for fractions of the price or the like or if you want practical martial art moves probably virtua fighter which sadly is not on PC yet.\nFrom a technical stand point the game engine lacks features like support for resolutions  such as 1440x900 (there's an unofficial mod you have to use to remove character stretching if you end up with an unsupported resolution) & multilayer was poorly implemented.\nOver all for the price the developers are asking for this you could buy 15 other fighting games on Steam plus many of the DLCs for those & have a better time & many many many more hours  of game play.\nIf you buy this you're wasting your money & supporting a developer who doesn't actually have any interest in the PC market & is simple after funds to fund japanese centric console games.

Lazy port, missing features, missing effects. Another cashgrab port from Koei Tecmo.\n\n\nPros:\n- The fighting mechanic is okay-ish\n- pick the pretty girl that suits your fetish\n- Best looking 3D fighter on PC (also only recent one)\n\nCons\n- No Multiplayer (promised for 3 month after release, apparently not coming)\n- Graphic effects from the Playstation are missing in the PC version\n- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ or no support for any input device that is not an Xbox controller\n- missing features (destructible clothing)\n- blurry textures on anything that isn't a character\n- extremely expensive DLCs\n- animations are sometimes wonky, leading to telepathic throws\n\n\nSince I am a bit of a fighting game fan and wanted to try a 3D fighter I bought this game. Then I discovered that features from the console version were flatout missing even though Koei Tecmo praised this game as the best version DoA5. Getting a fightstick to work with it was also a chore and some inputs (rotating camera) are flatout impossible. Using a gamepad is possible, but the game only knows Xbox controllers and will only display those inputs. At least the combat system is servicable and there are a lot of characters as well as a ton of alternate costumes. However instead of the promised multiplayer, KT delivered some ridicolously overpriced costumes. So this game is only as much fun as a fighting game with no multiplayer can be. And if you are looking for that, just get SFxT. Or get something with working multiplayer.\n\nIn conclusion I would have been better of saving my money for Tekken 7. Or getting the PS4 version, which is superior.\n\nDon't buy KT's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ports.","July 6, 2015","false","20.7"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","8"

GTX 580, i7 2600k and 32GB ram, while running a boatload of other processes at the same time. Resolution 1920x1080 FXAA. The wired xbox 360 controller also seems to work as it should, though without vibration which I'm fine with. There are multiple options for controller settings, so if something is wonky, take a look at them in-game.\n\nI think the game looks great! The figures are detailed and while it may not have an over abundance of particle effects, it does have plenty of effects in stages. Hair looks good and breasts move quite well. Not sure which version we got there, but it is pleasing to my eyes :)\n\nI've only played a little, just like everyone else reviewing at such an early time, but so far I'm happily surprised. I pre-ordered despite all the hate in various Internet forums and I'm happy I did. I played DOA way back on the PS1 and this is the first time I've picked up the title again. Well worth the purchase!\n\nI know we didn't get everything they got on PS4, but honestly I have a hard time feeling cheated. I won't miss the two stages and if you freeze framed certain scenes it is almost illustration quality.\n\nSo I recommend this game to anyone reading this and also my friends. It IS a good fighting game and I could care less about "achievements". By the time they patch in network support, I'll have gotten enough practice to actually put up a decent fight.\n\nThanks TECMO for bringing the game to PC.

I WANT THE FEATURES THAT MAKE THE COMPLETE GAME. ITS WHAT I PAID FOR!!! ♥♥♥ YOU TECMO for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥izing the greatest franchise you own just to make a few console nerds ♥♥♥♥♥♥ happy that they have the best version. ♥♥♥ YOU ♥♥♥ YOU ♥♥♥ YOU ♥♥♥ YOU! I can't say it enough. You ♥♥♥♥♥ your best customers so you could keep a couple fan boy loli gaggers happy. UNACCEPTABLE.\n\nEdit: So in just a little over a week from now it will have been two months since my original post here and the game is in still much the same shape it was then. Still no soft engine or destructible clothing and I understand online will be coming but hurry it up, you should never ship an incomplete product. Oh and the prices for the costume packages now total out over 250 or so dollars. It's getting a tad bit to be a joke. I like that there isn't a market place in the same sense that csgo or tf2 have going for them but what they do offer is seriously a joke at those prices. I wonder if they are meeting their ideas of success with sales on those DLCs. I would love to hear thousands have already bought them. I just wouldn't believe it.\n\nSo there is many strong points with this game, but since I must be critical and I am more than a little furious with the company's decision, I can not recommend this title for purchase. First I will discuss the good and then I will get in to the nitty gritty as to why I can't currently recommend this title.\n\nAs a long time fan of the series, sex appeal has always been top two of reasons as why to play this game. Well DOA5LR is no disappointment. It lives up to all its fame and offers a roster that many titles can't compete with. I did preorder and with that came a wealth of outfits. I mean outfits for days. Many of them are fun and for all to see but there lay a few awesome barely covering outfits in there as well. The other of the top two reasons is fighting. DOA5LR offers many different styles of fighting and it is all so fluid. Reminds me of old school tekken 2 or tag. It really brings back some good memories of fighting games from the past but with a super sexy twist.\n\nI don't want to sit here and praise a game that actually could have been beyond amazing. Instead it has turned in to a watered down half ♥♥♥♥♥ port, with missing features entirely to boot.  One of the glorious reasons to own a pc is for control. Well... You are stuck with the preset resolutions they offer, admittedly they do offer a 4k res but where is my 1440p res. They also completely left out the Soft engine, which gives the skin a much more pleasant and realistic look to it. NO DESTRUCTABLE CLOTHING!!! Are you kidding me! Forget the fact that you left out a super important engine that would perform better on a pc than a console but you also took out the destructable clothing!!! This is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. At the time of my purchase it was pretty much a given that this would be the difinitive version. Then after the purchase came this sneaky update message. I am beyond disappointed and will not be able to recommend this to anyone until the Destructible Clothing  and the Soft Engine are implemented. Those are HUGE features to not implement in the PC release and will be a reason I won't support any more of your games.\n\nFurther add insult to injury. Have you seen the prices for the Steam DLC  costume packages. For the current two sets it is $119.99. Out of your damn minds. I mean out of your god damn minds. I want to buy them but for closer to 90% off their asking price. More like $10 bucks per collection. Yeah that really is a middle finger to PC gamers. The $35 dollar price for the game itself is beyond fair but this other dlc stuff is wonky tonky.\n\nTECMO, Team Ninja or whoever makes the decisions. Please please please get your ♥♥♥♥ together. Add Destructible Clothing, Soft Engine and more customizable options in settings like resolution and Anti Aliasing options. Let us enjoy the game we want to. Until then I will remain strong and not recommend this title. Hope you change your mind and fix this game.\n\nEdit: So I can't get back at you in the way you got all of us, but here are the videos they want you to pay 64.99 for. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAniM8XACVQ Jerks.","April 9, 2015","false","7.8"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","12","23","2","0"

Seems well optimized so far, I´m running it at downsampled 4K with constant 60fps (Yes, it is capped at 60FPS, but everyone that  knows a thing or two about fighting games knows that it has to be). The fact that features are missing sucks (especially the online mode), there´s no doubt about that. But If you don´t have a next-gen console and like fighting games, give this game a chance. You won´t regret it.","March 30, 2015","true","30.5"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","0"

It has:\n- real 3D mechanics (no 2.5D like USF4 and MK)\n- very dynamic, complex and advised combat system\n- there is no stupid floaty jumping. There is no jump command at all! There are, of course, possibilities to make jumping kicks, somersaults, body slams and other acrobatics but it's very personal actions for different characters. So there is no art for art's sake.\n- There is no exaggerated violence so I can play with my wife!\n- Girs, girls, girls!\n- Great, real 3D, multi-leveled stages with danger zones and destructable elements.\n- dozens of combos and throws for every character!\n\nUnfortunatelly there is no two new stages, and new particle effects that was added to PS4 version. it hurts a little, but...\nAll the rest looks just as well (if not better).\nFor online fights we need to wait for 3 months (WHHHYYYYY?!?), but it's the end of insufficiencies.\n\nAnd don't talk about soft engine - I've played the game couple of times on PS4 and saw it in action - it's tinpot feature!\n\nMy machines:\n1.

I just loaded the game up and went into the tutorial to check out the controls, and they are the exact same thing as the xbox 360 version. You can even remap them if you dont like them.\n\nAs for the soft skin being missing and the two maps....this was announced a few weeks ago that they would be pulled from the game. So if people are giving this a bad review for those 2 reasons, you should do some research before buying a game. They also posted exactly what each feature would look like, and that the online modes would be patched in in 3 months. Again just people not paying attention.\n\nI recommend it. It looks good, plays smooth, its a good fighting game and definitely worth getting if you are an avid fighter junkie like me. Is it perfect? No it has a few flaws but its a very good pre-order launch\n\nUpdate: Having spent some time playing the game i have to say that people negatively reviewing this game are mistaken. I have no performance issues on my gaming laptop that has a\n770m (equivalent of a 660) and i get solid 60fps. The controls are flawless and exactly how they were on the console version. If you are using a k/m for this game, don’t. It is not that kind of game and you will not have fun.\n\nThere are a few concerns people brought up that i understand. First there are no achievements. While this is sad, it is not that big of a con considering lots of games don’t offer achievements. I imagine they will be patched in at some point though.\n\nThe save issue i did not encounter and would no recommend changing your steam ID for right now until this is fixed. The game relies on a weird local save apparently, so if yu change your steam id you lose your save. As i said, i did not notice or encounter this issue so i can’t say if it does or does not exist.\n\nAnd lastly, there are no graphic options. The graphics are set as they are and all you can adjust are the shadows and resolution. The graphics are equivalent to the ps4 except for the particle effects. The game still looks great despite this.\n\nIf you are looking to buy this game, please take the negative feedback with a grain of salt. It works, it is smooth and it is a ton of fun if you enjoy fighters.","March 31, 2015","true","14.8"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","0"

Then don't buy. You're not really looking to play this as a fighter? Then don't even bother.

Team Tecmo, you are bad ninja, bad!   I consider myself a fan of the series.   My own experience with DOA began with DOA 2 on PS2, then 3 on Xbox, 4 on 360, 5 on PS3 and 360, and 5 LR on PS4 and now PC.   I'm loyal to a brand so long as they are loyal to me.   That's an important point to make at the outet.\n\nWhy the lack of love?  First, let's be fair and even.   I’ll dispense praise and scorn where justified.  First, no unfair whining here about cut-scenes being 30 fps!  It’s pre-rendered, and the standard for video is 24/30 fps.\n\nSecond, DOA 5 LR does look decent in Nvidia 3D.\n\nThird, it doesn't take a powerhouse to run it.    Even with 3D active (but @720p), I was able to get a smooth 60fps with a Nvidia GTX560.  Without 3D @ 1080p, the same.    I tested it on my other gaming rig (Nvidia 780), of course it runs smooth on that.\n\nFourth, at least they took time to  include Steam achievements and trading cards...no wait, they didn’t.   Ok, that’s enough praise, now it’s time for scorn.\n\nBefore I tackle the PC-specific part, let's discuss the storyline.   First, convoluted, non-sensical, lame, and lazily written come to mind as brief yet appropriate descriptions.  For some there seems to be no expectation for a storyline.   Many other fighting games say otherwise:  MK, Injustice, and Blaz Blu, for example.   Second, the animations could certainly have been improved from DOA 4.  They are not.  Clipping can be atrociously awful.   Now let's examine some  PC-specific aspects.\n\nThe port is not simply bare-bones, it’s been stripped and gutted.    Bad ninja, bad!  No achivements, no bonus stages, no next-gen effects.   Heck, they couldn’t even be bothered to include in-game graphic settings.     There's no Cloud saving which further adds to the lack of attention DOA 5 LR got on PC.\n\nSomeone might object, saying, “They ported the PC version off of the arcade version.” Hey, gotta give respect for the “I don’t mind being served ---- in my cornflakes, and I’ll eat it 'cos I love Team Ninja!” propagandists.  Just don't give them very much.\n\nTo make up for the unsweetened PC version, TN "gives" you ludicriously overinflated priced DLC.    Bad ninja, bad! Console-users can purchase DLC individual, not in the two bundles currently available for PC.   The Team Ninja fanboys might tell you, "It's priced about a dollar or two for a costume, not bad."    With that reasoning the base game should sell for $400+ for all the costumes it does include.    I wish Bethesda was the norm for quality and fair-priced DLC.   Considering the success of Skyrim (and Oblivion), you’d think they would be.  They aren’t, but Team Ninja takes the cake and poisons it.  They are some worse examples.  So what?\n\nNo online play.   Okay, they claimed that it will be out in three months from release date.  You can trust Koei Tecmo / Team Ninja to keep their word.  They’re honest, right?   Well, to be fair, they were kinda deceptive at first about the state of the PC version.     Bad ninja, bad!\n\nMods....the saving grace of the PC version.  They’ve (TN) stated that other than nude mods, they’ve got nothing against mods.  They lie!  Bad ninja, bad!  In the short time, the PC version has been out, Koei Tecmo has removed mods and YT vids of said mods that do nothing more than swap in higher-res textures.\n\nIf you think mods are going to turn your gaming experience around, the lawyers at Tecmo Ninja, have already  said otherwise.  BAD BAD BAD bad ninja, bad!\n\nWhy continue?   To be FAIR, there were unrealistic expectations about DOA 5 LR from the beginning.   The last decent DOA was DOA 4, exclusive to the 360.   Ironically the Steam discussions are full of console hating gaming posers.  (Rant\)If a movie isn’t shown at 40 fps in 3D IMAX, you won’t go seet it?  Hating games on consoles is ignoring many of the greatest games ever produced in any genre of gaming.  If your gaming PC costs 10x the price of console, shouldn’t you be able to afford a console or two or three?  Guess they maxed out their credit and now can only buy bundle games for their $4,000 gaming rig! (/Rant)  DOA Xtreme 2 followed DOA 4 on 360.  Conceptionally, it seemed like a winner:  a sim/casual game with lots of T&A.  The actual game part was executed so poorly that it made the experience worse than seeing a dentist who faked his credentials.  In other words, it was painful.   They released  a mobile version of it on the PSP, which made it even more painful since now you were having teeth pulled by a horribly deformed dentist with really bad breath.  They finally followed up DOA 4 with DOA 5, taking lots of inspiration from Capcom in how to mistreat your own IP.\nBad ninja, bad!\n\nI won't say don't buy DOA 5 LR.  Just don't pay full price.  I paid too much even with the GMG discount code that reduced it cheaper than the Steam price.     When it's slashed 75% off, maybe go for it then....","April 5, 2015","false","1.2"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","19","37","3","0"

When starting the game, have your controller plugged in and use the controller to press A to continue, I was stuck with keyboard being assigned player one for the first time.\nI've put in a plenty of hours since DOA 3 and in my opinion DOA 5 LR is the best in the series when it comes to the gameplay.

Played around for a bit to get a feel for the differences from the console versions and to see how the controller support is. Was rather wary of the "partial controller support" they said on the store page. After some initial hiccups everything worked out fine. When starting the game, have your controller plugged in and use the controller to press A to continue, I was stuck with keyboard being assigned player one for the first time.\nI've put in a plenty of hours since DOA 3 and in my opinion DOA 5 LR is the best in the series when it comes to the gameplay. I'm not a fan of the LR introduced new characters because they both feel very lazy. Rig and Mila were great, why the sudden drop in quality?\nThis particular game series is ridiculously controversial over the stupidest ♥♥♥♥ but is a very enjoyable fighting game. Massive bonus points for the inclusion of guests from Virtua Fighter who feel and play great and fit right in.

Otherwise, they'll play a couple of ranked matches, get cakewalked by a decent player, and then quit anyway.\n\n- Nothing here for a long term fan of the series, if they have access to a PS4/bone.

Arcade and console games from Japan are often terrible ports and apart from a few exceptions there’s very few fighting games on the PC worth playing.\n\nThis port works. It’s graphics are great especially in 4k and very smooth fps. The texture resolution is more than adequate for the stages and the character models have superb detail.\n\nI know some people dislike the removal of the Soft Engine, but if you’re that desperate for realistic jiggly boobs then there’s many other ways to get your fix. Not exactly game breaking is it. “The wobbliness of the boobs are all wrong.. GAAAA~Tableflip”  Get over it.\n\nControls works perfectly, plug in a good controller and it feels just like the playstation version. what more can you ask?\n\nThe menus and graphics are perfectly fine. Some fonts could have been redone a bit higher res but this port is not the broken mess that Dark Souls was.\n\nDead or Alive 5 plays, and plays well.  And online will arrive soon.  Yes I know it was odd to release without that feature and that is a big turn off for many, but the feature is coming. many other game ports have left those kind of features out all together.  Once it does there’s no reason to knock this game.\n\nThe PC needs more games from Japan’s arcades ported across so I will applaud this release for being one of the better efforts, if it just encourages other games to make their way over to the PC.","April 6, 2015","true","17.7"," 20 of 40 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","20","40","0","0"

The core formula is still the same as the late 90's PSX release: babes and bouts, and the tagline can still be the same as well: there's much more behind the gorgeous busts in this fighting game.\nThe graphics looks decent, but being the latest iteration of an older title is not top notch, the previous generations of fighting game had remarkable graphics, sadly this aspect is being overlooked lately, of course it is still totally nice and enjoyable, but it is not something as revolutionary as it was back in the days. On the other hand the design is extremely beautiful, the models are perfect and the characters have a magnetic appeal and a wide variety, it is impossible to not find someone to pick and like. Moreover there's an impressive number of outfits for each character, the costumes DLC are too pricey (2x times the cost of the game each) but there's enough variety in the game even without those DLC. Moreover the mod community seems to be pretty excited about this game, so much that the first mod came out in less than 24 hours. It was a nude mod but it counts as well. The stages are rich in variety and interactivity, and also for that the battles are still spectacular, flashy and fast paced. The cinematic camera option allows for some satisfying moments, especially when one of the players is send crashing throught a wall and then down in the street and the fight continues outside the building, or when the battle unfolds on raft moving down a waterfall.\n\nThe core gameplay is fun: easy to pick but hard to master. It is rare to have depth and simplicity in a fighting game. Alternative titles such as Virtua Fighter or Tekken are much harder to approach for newbies. The basic system is an intuitive triangle one: strike beats grab, hold/defend beats strike, grab beats hold/defend. The game is overall very offensive, with a fast paced gameplay: strikes have a great variety of range and angles and allows the attacker to build pressure; the player on the defensive can turn the tables around by timing an hold right or has the option to keep his defense up hoping not to be crushed in the meantime. A lot of dept is added by strategic use of guard breaks and stun moves, togheter with critical burst ( some sort of super moves) and by spacing strategies which are essential to master at an higher level. The interaction with stages is still there and it is an active part of the fighting strategy. Balanced match are not onesided: juggle and long comboes do not hinder too much the defensive options, there is always some window to turn the tide with a well timed hold. Usually the fights boils down to who makes the best guess and who controls the space better. It is extremely fun to play versus any human player around the same ability level, meanwhile the AI is usually good at holding, almost on godly level if you set maximum difficulty, but it seems quite easy to fool if you know how to space properly. It is always challanging and fun to fight until a cetain level of mastery.\nThe tag-team mode adds another layer of complexity to an already deep gameplay, forcing the player to rethink strategies and to perform new tag-team comboes to keep the pressure up.\n\n\nThe big issue is the absence of online play on release, and today that's one of the most important option in a fighting game. Yes there's plenty of game modes avaible and a very rich, long and enjoyable story mode with fully animated CS, but in the long run the game longevity suffers from the lack of online play.\n\nThe PC port has a decent quality if compared to the console versions, however much more could have been done to improve the graphics. Ultimately once these small problems are set aside what remains is a solid game with a great cast of characters. It is definitely a fighting game with attitute, and for its price on steam it is well worth picking if you're into fighting games, for a first timer who's not too picky and enjoys the graphics design and the characters it is a good starting point.\n\n7/10","April 10, 2015","true","39.7"," 20 of 40 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","20","40","0","0"

Yeah I don't play with gamepad, strangely enough.\n\nThose who want to play online, using special characters on their nickname, and like to change nickname every once in a while might find this game problematic, but since I don't do that, I'm not missing anything.\n\nOverall I found this game enjoyable, versus-ing all the time with Aloha Kasumi is never going to bore me.\nAnd before I forget, this game is absolutely alt-tab friendly which is nice.\n\nI hope Team Ninja will fix things and added lost features through update...","March 30, 2015","true","106.1"," 17 of 34 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","17","34","0","0"

I had it preordered from the day it popped up on steam, then cancelled my preorder yesterday only to buy it again a couple of hours later.\n\nI DO NOT REGRET MY PURCHASE.\n\nGAMEPLAY is great, perfectly smooth performance in 4k (i5 3330, 8GB RAM, Radeon HD 7950 with 3GB) and the fighting mechanics are top notch, wether you are just pushing buttons/keys or aiming for the right moves at the right time.\n\nGRAPHICS are easy on the eye, characters looks nice (the obvious DOA style present!!) and even though SOFT-ENGINE is missing, skin looks pretty  natural. Now on to what's probably most important to all you pervs out there:  B00B movement can be adjusted ingame (off, natural, DOA) and even though DOA-mode is very well *ahem* pronounced, is way more realistic than DOAX2 's balloon pinned to a wall in a storm movement.\n\nMULTIPLAYER is only missing for online play and will be patched in in about 3 months and honestly speaking I don't mind this right now, as I want to practice a lot before I get my butt handed to me by some crazy lagger pro XD\n\nOverall I can reommend this game for any DOA-fan and/or fighting game fan as there are some robust fighting mechanics underneath the shiny art.\n\n","March 30, 2015","true","53.8"," 77 of 154 people (50%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","50","77","154","6","1"

Just read through a few of them here and/ or search "DOA 5 for PC reviews" in your favorite search engine and the mojority seems to be unaminously in agreement with most of the complaints levied against DOA 5. It is a lazy port, plain and simple. The only negative that bothers me personally is the lack of online VS. mode but I knew that going in and I had confidence that it would make it's way to PC. Team Ninja recently announced the addition of online will happen later this month. If it is a success, I may change my recommendation.\n\nI have played and owned every major iteration of the DOA series and in my opinion, DOA 1 is the worst of the franchise, with DOA 4 being at the top of my list followed by 3, 5, 2 ... (I prefer the fighting in 5 more so than 3 but Team Ninja "effed up" the PC port).\n\nDOA is actually a great fighter if you give it a chance and one of the few fighters that is both "noob" friendly and can satisfy the serious fighter fan. I believe that my opinion holds some weight because I have a lot of experience with fighters and I think it was fighting games that crystallized me as a gamer. DOA 5 also plays smoothly on my machine, well above 60 fps, I have to lock it at 60 but your mileage may very, there are reports of bad framerates and bugs. I use an xb1 and/ or 360 controllers. I can't comment on the quality of keyboard and mouse controls for this game and I honestly would never play a fighter with keyboard and mouse.\n\nFor now, if you love DOA and do not want to experience it on a console, then the PC port will have to suffice, especially worth it at a discount. Everyone else should stay away until the game gets online at the very least.\n\nPeace.","June 16, 2015","false","34.5"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","13","26","0","0"

Played around for a bit to get a feel for the differences from the console versions and to see how the controller support is. Was rather wary of the "partial controller support" they said on the store page. After some initial hiccups everything worked out fine. When starting the game, have your controller plugged in and use the controller to press A to continue, I was stuck with keyboard being assigned player one for the first time.\nI've put in a plenty of hours since DOA 3 and in my opinion DOA 5 LR is the best in the series when it comes to the gameplay. I'm not a fan of the LR introduced new characters because they both feel very lazy. Rig and Mila were great, why the sudden drop in quality?\nThis particular game series is ridiculously controversial over the stupidest ♥♥♥♥ but is a very enjoyable fighting game. Massive bonus points for the inclusion of guests from Virtua Fighter who feel and play great and fit right in. More of this, please.\n\nAs it is now, I'm putting a positive hopeful review and shall check the online versus when it's introduced. I'd really wish they'd introduce more new characters and maybe even more VF guest characters in future updates and also hope they keep updating all the versions and not leaving the PC or old generation behind.\n\nSome positives and negatives.\n+ AA\n+ Hairstyles and easier customisation menu, said features displaying on character before confirming\n++ Christie\n+ More than 400 costumes.. People complaining about them being locked haven't played the game enough to unlock them.\n\n- Some stuttering framerate during character intros.

Despite the less features that didn't tcome to this port, the game runs pretty solid and no lag and issues have occured since I've played this. So techincally its not a BAD port persay. It might not have the flashy particle effects the PS4 has and the skin toner Soft Engine that just makes the skin apear "soft" or realistic", the quality of the game looks really great. The two new stages ofc are missing but I realize that this is actually a replica of DOA5 Ulitmate Arcade in Japan that has the two new characters but not the new stages. Hopefully seeing that I see DLCs in the store page, I'm sure they will add the rest of the stages at a later date. Online is suppose to come in another 3 months. As much as that is a bothersome for all of us fighting game fans for online, It is coming and its better than having no online period. While offline, I can learn the game's basic controls and and gameplay mechanics so when the online comes out, I wont look like a scrub mashing buttons and not knowing what I'm doing. Buy this for a collection for your fighting game library (and pleasure) and just to learn the game til online comes out. Otherwise you can wait til a sale happens or when online is implimented.\n\nIn Summary - The port is great with no performace issues or lag. Negative reviews just shows salty fans still ranting for less of what they had got. Be smart and test the game out before judging the fact that it doesn't the little features it could have. A great runing game with less flashy features is better than a broken game with less flashy features.","March 31, 2015","true","17.4"," 23 of 46 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","23","46","0","0"

I'd like to see comments responding who can tell me what about my review is helpful and what's not so that I can improve it and other reviews, both those that I will make in the future and the few I've done in the past. This lack of any sort of verbal response otherwise leads me to believe that people are voting "helpful" on my review because I liked the same game they did and recommended, and others are voting "not helpful" because I liked the game and recommended it and they hated it; this being perfectly counterintuitive to how helpful vs. not-helpful reviews should work, I'd like to be proven wrong.\n\nEdit of below: I just wanted to add, to clear up any possible confusion regarding what I said about "not having a beast of a rig," this link: http://valid.x86.fr/5ea3c6 This is a link to the CPU-Z validator page for my current build. In my opinion a good machine but not a game-chewing monster. The fact that I have no problems running this game won quite a few points in my book.\n\nAll of the pre-order hate can stop now. I pre-ordered this game and I regret nothing.\n\nThe internet would have me believe that this game will require a beast of a rig to run and not look hideous. I do not have a beast of a rig.\n\nI cranked it as open as I can: 1080 (can't do 4K), full AA, maximum shadows. Jumped right into a fight. Despite a very active background and the pace of the fighting, the game never dropped under 59 FPS for me and otherwise stayed solid at 60. I only noticed the frame drop on account of clocking it with FRAPS.\n\nAppearance wise, the game is gorgeous. The details are there--fighters get sweaty or dirty as the matches go on, and there's plenty of destructible environment for you to smash your opponent into and through, just as expected. Soft engine? Don't need it. Maybe it's just my eyes, but the skin looked pretty skin-like to me.\n\nAnd finally, the core component of it--the experience. I haven't played a DOA game since DOA2 Hardcore on the PS2, and this game perfectly captures that same feel of a high speed, incredibly intense fight that I had from that. I never played the original DOA5 on other consoles, but if it played like this? I can see why it was so positively received. This was exactly what I expected for and hoped for out of a Dead or Alive game.\n\nIn short, KOEI delivered--this game is exactly what I wanted when I pre-ordered it for myself and my friends. And when the multiplayer component is added in, I will gleefully let myself get the snot beaten out of me on the internet in enjoyment of this game.","March 31, 2015","true","7.0"," 26 of 52 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","26","52","0","1"

All the chracters I spent my hard earned cash on are now included in the game plus 2 new characters and a ton of costumes are included that used to be DLC.\nI've heard that controller support could be better, but i'm running my ps3 control to work as a Xbox 360 control and it works perfectly for me.\nAll around it's a great release if you're a fan of DOA, it's a bummer that we have 1 less stage and we don't have the soft engine on the PC version but you gotta give the console guys something with how little there is on the new consoles. They also could've approached DLC better, having to buy the packs together rather than being able to buy the costumes seperately was a pretty dumb descision (especially since each pack costs more than the actual game), but at the end of the day it's just DLC and you don't really need it.\n***Edit****\nAt this point i'm kinda salty about the lack of Online, despite being close to 4 months past what they'd originally planned, fighting computers only has so much novelty, I got a pretty good amount ofenjoyment out of the game but I probably won't be putting alot of time into it until the online fully comes out.","April 10, 2015","true","13.4"," 24 of 48 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","24","48","0","0"

Koei Techmo really fell through. I pre-ordered because I enjoyed Dynasty Warriors 8 XL. Tecmo demanding no mods, but then hosing the PC community of features, and on top of that realeasing $50-$60 DLC as if this is going to be Game of the Century. There is really no reason to buy this over the console version.  Tecmo should work to update the PC version to XB1/PS4 version, but we all know that won't happen. I'd be shocked if we got full controller support, and keyboard config. Other than that it's just DoA 5, minus graphics features, online mode (I doubt they'll add it now they're being called out for being crap) 2 maps, and Steam features. They should either add the feaures, or price the game at what it's really worth. $20+DLC. If you insist on making bad PC ports then at least charge fairly. This version is missing the XB1/PS4 features, has no Steam features, has a near broken save system on PC (if you use special characters in your name your game won't save) yet costs the same.\n\nEdit- If you're disappointed in the graphics as I was then use SweetFX. Apparently fans acted fast, and in 24hrs added SweetFX configs that really make the graphics pop.\n\nEverything you need to know about this terrible developer can be seen in TotalBiscuit's video "Lets not play Koei Techmo's PC Ports".\n\nUpdate 2/16\nAlmost a year after, and this game is still a complete mess. Online has been abandonded by the developer, the engine was never updated (still PS3 goodness), and DLC has become the biggest joke on the planet.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jhobz/recommended/311730/","jhobz","Jhobz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jhobz/","277 products in account","I'll be reviewing base on my experience on the game. I'm not really good at giving reviews but I'll try my best to be informative to those future buyers.\n\nPROS\nNovelty - Dead or Alive franchise have stayed with us for a long time now and novelty is arguably the selling point of the game. Who wouldn't want to see gorgeous girls duke it out in a martial arts combat wearing only their bikini and lingerie and see their chest part bounce as you execute their move?\nGameplay - The fight mechanics is not that unique to other fighting games out there but it is still deep and technical. It's easy to chain combos and the counter system is a nice touch. The game features 30+ roster including some characters from Virtua Fighter series.\nHuge Amount of Game Modes and Contents - The game features several game modes: Story, Arcade, Versus, Survival and so on. It also includes a sizeable amount of costumes and other unlockables.\nImproved Texture, Lighting, Shadows and AA effects - This is by far the advantage of PC version over its console counter part. There's a very noticeable improvement on textures. They are much sharper and more detailed. The Anti-aliasing is executed perfectly as it smoothed out those edges. It is also worth noting that the lighting and shadow effects is much better than it's console counterpart.\nExaggerated Minimum Requirements - It should be a con probably? Well the game runs fine on dual-core and the game barely use 400mb of RAM. The game also runs on single core so using i7 CPU is pointless but you still need a decent graphic card for better game experience.\nLocal Multiplayer Feature - You got a buddy and extra controllers with you? Good news! It supports up to 4 controllers and you and your buddies can play offline!\nMAJOR CONS\n\nInferior Particle Effects - PS 4 version have superior particle effects. It improves some effects like dust, fog, snow, improve light rays and sparks from the game stages.\nAbsence of Soft Skin Engine - This is the cause of ire on PC community. Soft Skin Engine greatly improves the physics on how the chest part bounces. It should be a minor con right? Well it should be but due to its absence, the PC version also don't have the destructible clothes since it relies on soft skin engine.\nController Support - As of now, only XBox 360 controller is officially supported (BTW most game supports only xbox 360 controllers).\nInput Device Bug - There are some reports that some input device makes the game stuck on auto-saving screen prompt.\nExpensive DLC - The DLC is double the price of the base game. It only includes costumes for several characters.\nAbsence of Steam Cloud Integration - It loses the ability to back-up your game saves via cloud. The game is saved locally meaning if something happens to your PC or the game save corrupted, you lose all your game progress.\nMINOR CONS\nExclusion of 2 Extra Stages - Most of the time, you'll be focused on the fighter instead of the backgrounds and the game still have 30+ stages to choose from.\nNo Steam Achievements - Doesn't really affect the gameplay at all. DOA 5 actually have in-game implementation of achievements in a form of titles.\nNo Cards - Cards means steam profile backgrounds. I was really hoping for a DOA 5 profile background :(\nDelayed Online Functionality - It was stated that the online functionality will be implemented within 3 months upon release of the game.\nNo Rumble Support - Rumble isn't really important with fighting games anyway.\nNo Option for Keyboard Key Rebinding - Using keyboard on fighting games is a bit impractical but still it wouldn't hurt if you can at least set the keys to more comfortable settings.\nSound is only available in Stereo - Not sure if this is even a con. If this was a FPS or TPS then it would really matter but for fighting game which sound source mostly comes from the front, stereo sound will suffice.\nSHOULD I GET THIS GAME?\nIf you have the console version especially the PS4 and Xbox One version, don't bother as it might disappoint you but if you don't have an access to consoles and want to experience DOA then this is totally worth buying.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIt may not be the port that we hoped for but it undoubtedly still gorgeous looking game with solid gameplay and with lots of contents. It's a nice addition to dwindling number of fighting game genre on PC.","March 31, 2015","true","27.5"," 73 of 147 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","73","147","4","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ANCRON/recommended/311730/","ANCRON","ANCRON","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ANCRON/","352 products in account","Dead or Alive 5 Last Round, a spectacle brawler / fighting game. Game has that unique attention to martial arts (to an extent) and female beauty.\n\nDead or Alive game on PC, what else could you wish for? Console fanboys might be picky about this, but PC gamers of all ages will love this. I don't care if it's PS3 or PS4 port, on videos they look identical. I could care less about some missing stages (if any), because that's not relevant. There's no Online mode yet, but it's in the works. I'm not even going to bother saying anything about "Soft Engine", don't really care personally. Sure it would be great if you could rebind buttons and such, but that "could" be added later down the line, but in no shape or form makes it harder to play.\n\nGame looks great in my opinion, with decent textures on basic, destructible environment and great detail on characters. Movement and attacks are responsive and easy to use even if you just mash the keys. It's even fine playing on keyboard, and not that challenging if you go through Training stages (and there are a lot of those, and then some).\n\nYou can play many different fighting modes; from 1 on 1 versus mode; two character tag teams; survival games where you try and defeat as many enemies as you can one by one or 8 on 8 elimination matches, and more. There's a story mode available, for those who like a bit of lore, it's basic with not much in terms of dialogue and voice acting depth, but it's enjoyable and funny.\n\nEach game can be customized to your liking, where you can adjust AI, health amount, clock, outfits, stages, hair styles, character details and more. Apart from training tutorial mode, you can practice combos, do a combo challenge rounds, save / play match replays with additional tool that lets you capture the screen shot of exact frame and angle you want from the match (no doubt you will find many funny and disturbing images on community site already).\n\nLike majority of fighting games, you have a decent roster of characters available, with their own strengths and weaknesses. Each have their own set of attacks and moves you can combo into devastating chains (there are a lot of combinations). Main aspect of the game for many people is their character, and to beat the life bar out of your opponents. But that's not all, it's equally important to have INAPPROPRIATE attire to the boot, so why not! You have  insane amount of costumes available for every character, and if you want more, there are always paid DLC's you can get to boost that wardrobe.\n\nGame has decent audio soundtrack, that will keep you going for a while. I admit, game has some light mature element to it, as you tend to unlock more and more skimpier outfits, but nothing completely nude (no sensitive parts). So I don't advise to play this under the age limit, but who am I kidding, just make sure door is closed at least, so people don't get any wrong ideas walking by your room. Other than that, it's fun fighting game to waste some time, and not get completely bored in process, as your eyes will get plenty of "candy". Personally I enjoyed it (from a completely normal gaming standpoint) more than games like Mortal Kombat, Injustice or Super Street Fighter.\n\nEnjoy.","April 3, 2015","true","17.9"," 73 of 147 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","73","147","2","7"

Those missing stages worry me, though.\n\nBut at this price, with the annoying Xinput controller mapping bugs, I simply cannot recommend it until that gets patched.\n\nIn my case this involves the triggers being swapped with start and select. Preferably we could remap them in-game, but this is currently impossible. This is a simple fix that is currently taking far too long to implement.\n\n5/27 patch includes no fix for this controller issue.\n\n7/16 still no fix.","April 1, 2015","false","8.2"," 28 of 57 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","28","57","0","0"

There seems to be a misunderstanding with the ports of the game. The Playstation 4 version of the game renders the internal resolution in 1080p and the PS3 version in 720p, if you set your graphical setting to that resolution the game will be equal in graphics for the most part to the PS4 version. The PS4 version of the game has the Soft Engine, which makes the characters boobs bounce even more than it already does (boobs bounce enough with just the DOA setting imo) and it adds a bright glow to characters skin. The Soft Engine does not add any significant new textures to the game.\n\nGameplay\n\nFor those already familiar with the Dead or Alive series, its combat system is known for its holding system. This entry to the series adds an extra layer to those mechanics with the new and improved stunning system. The game runs at a smooth 60 FPS depending on your machine and, there are new and improved movesets as well. New mechanics such as critical burst, power launchers, power blow, and environmental features such as the cliffhanger gives DOA a new fresh look.\n\nGraphics\n\nThis seems to be the controversal topic of the game. As I stated earlier this port is lays very close to the PS4 version, but it does not include the Soft Engine. This uses the same textures and graphics of the PS4 version with the exception of the Soft Engine's glow on characters skin. There are MSAA options , and 4k shadows in this port which would make it potentially better than the console versions. DOA5 offers very detailed environments, as well as character models. The dirt, and sweat are nice touches to character detail.\n\nOnline\n\nThe online features have not yet been added to this game, and is still being worked on. I assure you that TK will release it in a later patch. What's better, a netcode that's being worked on or a bad one? I totally understand a customer's furstration for not having this feature upon release, I am also one of those customers. I agree with everyone regarding this.\n\nPlay the game for at least a few hours before you make a  negative review guys. TK is a foreign company that develop games for primarily consoles. TK are not excusable for their poor communication with us before the release, but we should also consider the circumstances.","March 31, 2015","true","85.8"," 21 of 43 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","21","43","0","1"

This is not Call of Duty.\nPersonally I prefer stages like "Forest" or "Lost World".\n\nOf course, it would be nice to have both of these but this is NOT a gamekiller.\nThe gamesystem is fine, the same you have on the last and current gen consoles.\n\nThe only missing feature that might be noticable, are the particle effects. But that's hardly a gamechange since it's just for the shows.\n\nAnd while we are talking about "shows": stop crying about the DLC prices. Nobody is forcing you to buy them, you don't need them to play the game and you they won't increase your character's power in any way.\nIt's just eyecandy!\nBut yes, it would be much better to release solo skins for every character so you don't have to buy those overpriced skinpacks.\n\nIn addition, there are still more than enough players complaining about the missing achievements.\nAchievements are working just fine, so i don't really know what you guys are talking about.\n\nBut the worst part of it is: missing online mode\nWe have a beta version that crashes a lot and has no options, but it's something.\nSo as long as you can play with a broken online mode, i would recomment you that game.\nIf you want to play local with a friend of yours: get this game, it's a lot of fun (or not, if you lose too much).\n\nAnd here the actual review of the game itself:\nIt's a fighting game that i personally play since Dead or Alive 1 (demo) on the PSX.\nIt's a fast game that is not so much combo oriented like others, because you can counter hit. So you are not going to fly around the stage for minutes while the enemy is smashing your HP to the end with one combo. You just have to predict your enemy's moves.\nCharacter designs are nice, although a bit too much boob-focused, but you will get used to it.\nSo it's an overall nice and fun fighting game but it has its drawbacks.\nThe animations are bad at some point because the bodies twist at some really unnatural way.\nAnd the hitboxes are not so accurate either. A punch will often hit you without any visual feedback.\nLast but not least, the additional Virtua Fighter character are a bit stiff. They aren't that dynamic like the original Dead or Alive character and their animations, although original, do not fit the game. Feels weird to play them.","July 14, 2015","true","42.2"," 17 of 35 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","17","35","0","1"

I was considering buying the game for my Xbox 360 but they've stopped selling it, and the bumped up resolution of the PC was pulling my interest anyway.\n\nPositive:\n- Great core game, intuitive fighting controls and plenty of moves to perfect.\n- Plenty of options, such as move training, story, arcade and time attack modes, replays and screen capture features.\n- Lots of characters, all with varied styles of fighting means great variety.\n- Lots of costumes for most characters built in, plus challenge of unlocking.\n- Achievements system built in to the game (not steam unfortunately, though still things to aim for).\n- Works out of the box with my Xbox 360 controller.\n- Smooth great looking graphics with high FPS on my GTX 770.\n- Fast loading, no lag noticed etc.\n- Girls - Kasumi's and Momiji look fantastic!\n- Customisable boob bounce and choice of panties - LMAO.\n\nNegatives:\n- Ridiculous price of DLC - seriously, £50 a pack, perhaps £10 maybe, but £50 - really!\n- Graphics resolution options - I have a 27" monitor with a common native resolution of 2560x1440 and thats not an option meaning I'm stuck at 1080p, how stuipd!  Thankfully some clever folks in the steam forum have written a patch and it now works great at native resolution.  Team Ninja really need to sort this simple issue out.\n- Doesn't appear to be a way to fast forward and rewind in replays, there oddly doesn't seem to be an option.\n\nOther:\n- There's mention of the PS4 soft skin feature missing, I've seen several videos on YouTube and I'm damned if I can see any major difference, the big difference between PS3 and PS4 looks like resolution to me, but on the PC that a non issue.\n- Lack of customisable keyboard - seriously go any buy a Xbox 360 controller for Windows, or better yet v2 of the Xbox 360 controller (improved D-Pad) and a wireless reciever.\n- Lack of online multiplayer - promised within 3 months so hopefully not an issue in the future.\n\nOverall I'd give it 9/10, seems like a great port from the consoles to me and runs at a much higher resolution.","May 5, 2015","true","22.3"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","16","33","0","2"

Just imagine: PC version does not included 2 (Holly shеit TWO) arenas, and graphics are less shiny. OMG it is a valid rant.[/sarcasm]\n\nI do like this game however, for what reasons? Well, first of all this is like only 3d fighting game on steam (Too bad we still don't have Tekken 5 and 6). The charecters are great and everyone uses a uniq for him\herself fighting style; Be that MMA, Ninjutsu, Mao-Tai or Drunken Fist; Every move, every combo, evey juggle are done with love and care. It is one of those fighting, where you wish to learn charecters and than pick one or two and learn how to play them; For the reason to see that execution of comlicated combos (and a lot of times, you can and actually must orcestraate them yourself, like in Guilty Gear or Blaze Blue).\n\nSecond is of course charecters themself. They are not chatty or anything doring combat, but do have a certan personality to them, alone or tag match, intros and outros, taunts, switching and executing power moves... hard to imagine anyone will not fall for a few of those guys and girls.\n\nMusic and sounds. Oh yeah, music maybe an ambient one, but this is an ambient kicks some major arsе. And game even let you to decide what music you wanna hear throughout fights: Be that charecter linked, or arena one -- up to you. There are also music from previous games of this series and player allowed to set it as much as he\she wants. And sounds are great: Moaning, huffs and puffs, ambient sounds of people screaming, shеit getting blown up, dust and sandstorms really fits in combat.\n\nUhm story mode is kinda clunky, and since it heavily rely on player to know previous games, might even feel wierd and incomplete... Whatever, it does have a few cool and fun moments (Battle for cookie is a legendary scene!). And there are also some other modes you can play; Combo challenges, training, PvP, PVC, tag matches, survival mode, team survival, earning titles... Game have enough content to keep you buisy for a while.\n\nGraphics? Good enough, actually it is good: Sweat, dirt, "xploshions, arenas. Whatevs I do not speak much about graphics. Art style however is nice, and arenas are rich in what they have to offer; Fro jungles and ancient temples to city rooftops and military zone somewhere in Iraq. Every arena have enough details and interactive object (That can be used to further hurt opponent) that you will come back to some of those again and again!\n\nAlso there are costumes for heroes and heroines and glasses, oh yeah glasses.\n\nTo sum it up: Unless Tekken 5 and 6 will end up on steam DoA 5 is probably the only 3D fighting right now that is both enjoyable and reach in what it have to offer.\n\nThe cons are: You can't rebind controlls (on keyboard), it won't read all gamepads and it may crash here and there with no particular reason.","August 1, 2015","true","115.1"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","12","25","0","0"

If you're looking to play competitively right now, the consoles are the way to go. If you're looking for some fast arcade action with a fun cast, you might give this a shot.\n\nAside from DOA's notorious skimpy outfits and provocative poses you'll find this is a very fast and flashy fighter with a large cast, a lengthy story mode, and a good mix of various arcade and training modes, including tag teams and combo/juggle training. The fighters are a blast to play and watch, particularly when pulling off satisfying reversals, burst moves, or tag throws. The ridiculous outfits range from crocodile suits to gift ribbon bikinis, and of course the game isn't shy about showing off its best assets in both win or lose poses. DOA5 isn't the most technical fighter around, but it does owe much of it's fighting system to Virtua Fighter, so there is some real meat to the fighting once you start getting better. There's enough content and characters here to keep you busy, and more than enough eye candy to gawk at, making this easily one of the more complete 3D fighter offerings on Steam.","May 28, 2015","true","70.7"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

Yet, we get 4k support while console version don't.\n\nIt's your typical DoA game, just like its predecessors.  The game still looks great on max and runs on 60 frames smoothly.  No hiccups or stutters (some cutscenes do have a little "skip" to them since they're locked to 30 fps).  While the graphics aren't "current gen", they can still be made to look better.  4k looks better than console and if you can't push 4k, get a mod to enhance particles.  It's not necessary as the game looks great on its own.  Full controller support.\n\nNow for the cons, the game will NOT have online for another month.  No online at launch was a huge turn-off for many (myself included), but it will be here.  Let's just hope it's done well.  2 maps from the PS4 version were also cut, as well as a couple costumes.  Speaking of costumes, the DLC on here is a joke.  Instead of smaller DLCs like on console, they bundle many DLCs together and charge $60+ for them.  Pretty much a slap in the face, especially considering all the DLC together cost almost 10x as much as the game.  They could make small bundles to buy DLC and people would feel more inclined to purchase.\n\nThe game is well worth it.  Best fighting game on PC.  While it may not be as good as the others were given the time, it's still a solid 7.5/10 and worth $30 or less.  I spent $22 and it was worth it, but I don't think I'd pay much more than that.\n\nIt's DoA, if you love the series, you'll love this one.  If you're new to the series, this is still a good game to introduce yourself to it.","May 12, 2015","true","13.1"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

I was playing DOA5 Ultimate on PS3 before this, and have played DOA2, DOA4 and DOA 3DS. The first section will be positive points. The second is the negatives.\n\nDead or Alive 5: Last Round is one of the smoothest and most intuitive fighting games you can play on PC. The fighting system of DOA is maintained with the balance of attacks, throws, and holds that work like rock/paper/scissors. The game is balanced in such a way that it's almost impossible to ever get juggled infinitely as the counter hold system allows for plenty of opportunity to punish aggressive opponents and the games physics(?) just don't allow for 1-combo kills.\n\nThe roster of characters is solid. There should be at least one or two anyone will like. It isn't hard to get in start doing cool moves. The tutorial and command training sections provide the proper information for beginners trying to gain a better understanding of their favorite characters.\n\nThere are a ton of costumes for all the characters, and more can be purchased through DLC.\n\nPlenty of modes for single-player, including a story mode that continues the plot of the previous games. The plot is written like a B-movie action film, just so you know.\n\nNegative things:\n\nYou may have read some of this already on the Steam page or in the forums.\n\n- Online mode isn't available yet. Developers are estimating 3 months until they can offer the feature in an update. I will update the post when the online feature is enable to testify whether it works and how customizable it is.\n\n- The effects of the game are PS3 quality instead of PS4 (honestly isn't noticeable without direct comparison).\n\n- 2 Stages are missing from game that are in the XBO/PS4 version. An odd exception, but they could be included in the future update.\n\n- Controller support has a strange issue right now where gamepad triggers don't register, and instead of mapped to the Start/Select buttons, and Start/Select functions are mapped to analog stick buttons.\n\n- No Steam Achievements, trading cards, or cloud support. Again, could be part of the future update. These elements will matter differently for different people. I personally don't care except for backing up my save.\n\n- Speaking of saves, apparently there is an issue if your Steam name has special characters in. Changing your name may cause the file to be unusable. I don't know if just changing back to the original name prevents this or it just gets locked either way.\n\nIf you like fighting games, I really can't recommend this any more highly. If the negatives scare you, throw this game on your wishlist and wait for the online update later this year.","March 30, 2015","true","24.3"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

DLC is reasonably priced if looked at in perspective of price per costume/movie included.\n\nI pre-ordered this and was quite unhappy with the state the game was released in, especially in comparison to the console versions. However, as of today, 45 steam achievements have appeared, and although they are currently locked (just for now), they show that Team Ninja is moving to rectify any problems that they had upon initial release. Some of the achievements also reference online play and crimson stages, two of the biggest bits of content left out of the initial release.\n\nAlso, in terms of the 'extortionate price' of the DLC, even I thought the same when seeing it for the first time, but when you look at how much each DLC contains, the price seems a lot more reasonable. However, they really should have just split them up into a lot smaller packs, both to make the price to seem more fair upon first seeing it, and to give players better choice of what they want to buy (e.g. buying 81 skins for £40 only to want/use 10 of them is a bit silly).\n\nFun Set - 81 costumes. Roughly 50p/$0.78 per.\nHalloween Set - 51 costumes. Roughly £1/$1.55 per.\nVariety Set - 68 costumes. Roughly 80p/$1.24 per.\nTropical Paradise Set - 54 Costumes, 16 movies. I roughly averaged the price of the skins from the first 3 packs at 75p/$1.17 per. This leaves the movies at roughly 60p/$0.93 per.\n\nExcuse the rough maths/currency conversion, but it puts things in perspective.\n\nProvided upcoming patches go smoothly, I'll be well chuffed.","May 20, 2015","true","0.6"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

It's as fun as the previous DOA's and manages to keep the satisfying feeling of pulling off that 12-15 hit combo + power bursts when you're on low health and turn the game around whilst driving your opponent into the ground.\n\nBut lets talk about money and DLC, which apparently is a bigger deal than i first thought.\nCurrently as of writing this there are 4 DLC packs with a total of 270 costumes between them, which altogether are selling for about £200, but range from £40-£55 per pack with each pack having about 70-ish costumes.\nI can see why this sucks. i mean, that's a lot of money for simply a bunch of skins, especially now that mods are growing and you can have your own costumes, not to mention the ever popular nudes...\nAnyway, in terms of money, that works out at a about £1 per costume, which might sound more reasonable to some. So why are we complaining about this? probably because it's a bulk purchase... If we could cheaply buy each costume individually then people would probably be happier.\n\nTL:DR\nGameplay - As enjoyable for me as the other titles in the series\nGraphics - 4k compatable - no particles (big deal?)\nDLC skins - Seems like a money grab: make each skin available seperately at a cheaper price","April 28, 2015","true","73.7"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

The core game has no problems at all. It even runs on my 8 years old core2quad q6600 with 8GB of ram and GeForce GTX 750ti @1080p, constant 60fps (not counting the win/lose posing as that's locked to 30fps), 1024x1024 shadow setting, and 2x SSAA.\n\nThe only viable complaints are the no cloud save and the save that's locked to the username, but the latter is nothing new if you play any of Team Ninja's game on the consoles.\n\nI have this game on my 360, PS3, and PS4, along with every single costume DLC on one platform... the so called missing features that so many of you are dissapointed at ain't all that to be honest. This PC verison is essentially DOA5 Ultimate Arcarde port + Last Round updates. There's no controller vibration because the arcade joystick doesn't vibrate either xD, no key mapping because there is no keyboard at the arcade, stereo sound instead of 5.1 because that's how the arcade machine is, and no achievments because the arcade doesn't have it either. Team Ninja took the easiest port because the arcade machine they used for Ultimate is 100% a PC. Why would they waste more resources porting PS3/360/PS4/XBO version which are proprietary formats. Sure, the latter two are x86 architecture but they are still more proprietary than the readily available arcade version they spent time and money developing couple years ago.\n\nAs someone whom already owned pretty much every console version there is, I did not hesitate to get it for the PC simply because it's the very first DOA game for the PC and I can install it on portable systems to play it anywhere I go. If you enjoy the core gameplay of the DOA series, there's no reason not to buy it. The so-call missing features are just icing on the cake, not manditory and does not affect gameplay one bit.\n\nAbout the delayed online modes, if you are already a DOA player like myself, we can easily wait. If you are a new DOA player or PC is the only format you have, it's actualy a good thing because you can take the time to pratice before heading out to the wild on day 1 and getting owned by veterans. :)","March 30, 2015","true","220.6"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

I read the minimum requirements, My Computer obviously meets them the problem this game by Default will not support a 5:4 Format monitor only 16:9 monitors I am quite happy with my multi 5:4 setup no need to upgrade.\n\n. With client modification I can run a manual settings patch which allows me to run in 5:4 Resolution Full Screen.\n\n2.) They are banning Modders for no reason This is why I regret paying money, anyone who modify the game can get banned from the game. (Talking about Custom Skin Mods, or Game settings/Graphics Mods.)\n\n. When I purchased pre-purchased this game (I was not required to accept any third party EULA, or Agreement)\n. When I purchased the game I checked for (VAC Secured) or Valve Anti Cheat.\n\nThe game did not specify that I could not run any modifications or make changes (to my licensed copy of the software on my system.)\n\nWhile I personally don't care over $35 spent on the game the company should (Offer a Refund to those who care) and no longer want this game due to banning modifications on a players own copy of the game.\n\nSo here are the solutions which would make me actually trust this game company again, or never buy another title from them again.\n\n1.) Offer a refund to those players who were not made aware of the modding\n2.) Stop the harassment to modders who simply want to enjoy a single player game their way and let them mod.\n\n3.) Why banning mods makes no sense is because regardless of steam, I can't go into specifics but players will just download a copy of this game outside of steam elsewhere and modify the game as much as they like along with all DLC packs (illegally)  and play the game meaning you lose money. (This is a good reason to support mods, and keep your customers happy.) And in short run its possible to play games that require steam without steam.\n\n4.) I would suggest updating the software to a EULA and put a proper third party agreement, because you could get a lawsuit.\n\nEither way I have already uninstall the game from my computer and have no plans of playing this game or recommending this game for these reasons stated above. Personally (Steam) should never allow a game company to keep their games on (Steam) if they are going to do malicious things like this.\n\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/as-predicable-as-the-sunrise-dead-or-alive-5-nude-mods-appear/\n\nOn another note I have always wanted to see (Console Games) come to PC, but can't stand to play games with companies today who do things like this to its players who spend their hard earned cash.","April 8, 2015","false","1.5"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

Since then team NINJA have only released console versions (except for DOAO). So I've never been able to pick up, but now finally DOA5 came out on pc and i got really excited.\n\nI haven't had a lot of time to play it yet, but i really like it so far to be honest. The story mode is quite hilarious but i would like more scenes after you´ve finished the fight (story wise). I don't mind the missing features on the PC version and i despise the nude mods. The reason being i want Team NINJA to continue the support on PC. (I don´t want to waste money on a peasant machine huehuehue)\n\nSome Cons about the game:\nThe DLCs are overpriced. Like come on its just costume sets, It would be more profitable If the prices were cut in half at least.\nBTW I wouldn't mind buying the extra features the ps4 and xbox one has as a DLC.\nThe online mode is not out yet buut we got story- and arcade mode, which is nice.\nNo achievements is a bit disappointing.\nAAAAND also no trade-cards nor badges.\n\nTL;DR\nIt's a nice game coming from a dude who is new to the series.

Based on forum talk the game has had its share of problems, so I consider myself lucky. But let's get to the actual review part.\n\nI played the Story mode in one sitting and took a glimpse on the Arcade-modes as well, and I have to say that I am enjoying it so far. I think that the story was interesting and there are plenty of fighters involved in it. The number of fights is ok in my opinion, you get around 70 or so chapters in it (1 chapter=1 fight) so depending of how many times you lose you might end up spending quite a bit of time with it.\n\nThe fights are fun and fast paced. I chose to play the Casual mode because I don't have that much experience from Fighting games and because the characters have a great amount of move sets you usually manage to deliver stylish combos even with trial and error. There is a command practice mode where you can try to master all the 100 or so different moves for each character if that's what helps you learn more easily. Also, Breast Motion settings. <3\n\nI was a bit sceptic whether or not there is any room for character customization at first because the game has a couple DLC bundles which are quite pricey on their own. Thankfully I was proven wrong and even though the base game might not give you for free all the most revealing outfits, there is still plenty of DOA-worthy cleavage. :) Some characters also have a few extra options in addition to the actual outfit like hairstyle or glasses which you can change. So unless you REALLY want all the towel outfits for the girls, it might be better wait for sales.\n\nI will probably update this review when the Online game modes become available but so far it's been very enjoyable and the game looks good even on my machine which is already a few years old. But for now I highly recommend the game for all who like me decided that Mortal Kombat X is too pricey and well....I would cheat myself if I didn't admit that Sweat + Breast Motion settings = cool. :D\n\n\n","April 28, 2015","true","12.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I do recommend the game for what it is. No I don't like what Koei have done with the PC version. The DLC prices are absurd as well.\n\nI will clear the negative first: This is a port of a sub-optimal version of the game.\nThe online has been a mess for a long time.\nThe DLC is absurd.\n\nDespite the negatives being very clear. The game itself is very fun and I have spent a crazy amount of time with it in total. I owned 2 versions (on Xbox 360) of this and I spent little time in snapping a third up even despite knowing it was a less than ideal version being ported over.\n\nI am not a fighting game player, not at all. I am terrible at everything there is to do in fighting games, I cannot play Tekken or Street Fighter to save my life but with Dead or Alive, the design choices mean that you can get into it really easily but still see where the rest of the game is beneath. Another thing is just how much weight is behind everything you do in this game in comparison to other fighters. 2d fighters are obviously flat, Tekken you're treated to a puff of red smoke on hit but with this, a good hit feels like a good hit.\n\nThe character designs are great also, though its as comedic as you might expect from Team Ninja. Yes, there really is an option for boob physics. Stick it on OMG mode for a couple of rounds, laugh, then stick it on whatver the basic setting is and forget about it and focus on the gameplay. I have some screenshots up, you can add in shaders and fiddle around with them to make the game more vibrant than it was originally.\n\nThe long and short of this is:\nIt's a sub-par version of the game that's ported, though it runs well and you can add shaders if you want.\nThe DLC is stupid.\nIf you aren't fussed about this and actually want a really fun, easy to get into fighter on Steam that you can pick up and put down when you want, this is your best option in my opinion. Just don't expect much from the online.\n\nIt's well worth sale price.","November 26, 2015","true","19.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Let's not deny it, I, you, everyone came to DoA for sexy girls, bouncing boobs and all that normal, understandable lust. But beside all that, DoA has a good system. The combos are smooth, the techniques are great, if you talk purely about martial arts and fighting styles, DoA is on par with Virtua Fighters or TEKKEN. To people that was a big fan of the "traditional" fighting games such as Street Fighters, King of Fighters, Mortal Kombat... you might feel a bit different at first since you can't jump in this game and the "special moves" inputs aren't very similar. But once you get similar to it, it can be pulled rather nicely.\n\nSo yeah, my hours on this game on Steam don't really talk much, and you might see other reviews about how bad the ladder/online competition is.

Its a fighter that does not take it self seriously even though hard core gamers want it to be Serious,\n\nthe story is based around kasumi who is Battling DOATEC and Mist. Who is battling the clones that Donovan has Created with a suprised Appearence from His Son Rig.. who know body knows is his Son. basically he does not remember what happened and why.. Play the story to find out more.\n\nControls for the game which I like the original One over this one. Its a Little more confusing at times when you can Land a Hold Throw or if its a Block. there is the Normal Throw Button but no Jumping thats only if you do a Combo set will it land a Jump before that you could push a Jump button and it would Jump in the past games.\n\nMy Favorite characters in this Long Series Running is Kasumi, AYANE, Hitomi, Honoka (of Course!) and TINA.\nthere are a Ton of Characters the Player can take his or her Time with.. Fighting Games are mean for the player to Learn and get down every single move. Takes Time and practice. but with the Dead or alive series. Scratch that you dont need to Learn that much to get good at this fighting game.. Its There for those who want to get in to a Fighting game..\n\nThere are some not major Errors with the arcade port. It does work with AMD radeon R9 card for those who have it. Its Fine.  There will be some Errors if you dont optimize it via the AMD CCC APP. other then that. Its Very Smooth Experience. you will find you self just playing a game and Having fun for once.\n\nNow most gamers of today are upset that there is no online use.. will for me and there maybe more like me out there who Remember back in the day the Online was a after thought. It was never marketed or Focused on. So for me i am not upset at the Online being missing because I bought this game just to play it when ever, i want to Load it and Just get way from it all.\n\ni can Recommend this game for those who have stress in there life. or maybe had a bad day.. you can pick up the controller and let all the Anger and hate out of you.. and keep it on the screen.\n\nFor this game i am just glad its on PC.. Now hopfully we see more from Team Ninja in the future.. maybe a Dead or alive 6 7 and 8 to complete the saga of the Dead or alive series.\n\nwho knows Does kasumi Die in the series or does she find Peace? there are alot of Questions to be answers. this why i keep coming back to the series?\n\nAlso the Errors come from a Frame buffer issue which most every game today has.. Due to Holding a video card back from doing its actual Higher Frame rate which is Past 60 Frames on a Single GPU.\nthere are some Texture Errors on Nvidia cards. and Sometimes on the Intel HD 4600 Card it self. how ever i never saw any of these With the AMD Video card.","April 23, 2015","true","67.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Its a fighter that does not take it self seriously even though hard core gamers want it to be Serious,\n\nthe story is based around kasumi who is Battling DOATEC and Mist. Who is battling the clones that Donovan has Created with a suprised Appearence from His Son Rig.. who know body knows is his Son. basically he does not remember what happened and why.. Play the story to find out more.\n\nControls for the game which I like the original One over this one. Its a Little more confusing at times when you can Land a Hold Throw or if its a Block. there is the Normal Throw Button but no Jumping thats only if you do a Combo set will it land a Jump before that you could push a Jump button and it would Jump in the past games.\n\nMy Favorite characters in this Long Series Running is Kasumi, AYANE, Hitomi, Honoka (of Course!) and TINA.\nthere are a Ton of Characters the Player can take his or her Time with.. Fighting Games are mean for the player to Learn and get down every single move. Takes Time and practice. but with the Dead or alive series. Scratch that you dont need to Learn that much to get good at this fighting game.. Its There for those who want to get in to a Fighting game..\n\nThere are some not major Errors with the arcade port. It does work with AMD radeon R9 card for those who have it. Its Fine.  There will be some Errors if you dont optimize it via the AMD CCC APP. other then that. Its Very Smooth Experience. you will find you self just playing a game and Having fun for once.\n\nNow most gamers of today are upset that there is no online use.. will for me and there maybe more like me out there who Remember back in the day the Online was a after thought. It was never marketed or Focused on. So for me i am not upset at the Online being missing because I bought this game just to play it when ever, i want to Load it and Just get way from it all.\n\ni can Recommend this game for those who have stress in there life. or maybe had a bad day.. you can pick up the controller and let all the Anger and hate out of you.. and keep it on the screen.\n\nFor this game i am just glad its on PC.. Now hopfully we see more from Team Ninja in the future.. maybe a Dead or alive 6 7 and 8 to complete the saga of the Dead or alive series.\n\nwho knows Does kasumi Die in the series or does she find Peace? there are alot of Questions to be answers. this why i keep coming back to the series?\n\nAlso the Errors come from a Frame buffer issue which most every game today has.. Due to Holding a video card back from doing its actual Higher Frame rate which is Past 60 Frames on a Single GPU.\nthere are some Texture Errors on Nvidia cards. and Sometimes on the Intel HD 4600 Card it self. how ever i never saw any of these With the AMD Video card.","April 23, 2015","true","67.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Not perfect, but solid! It's awesome that it has improved resolution and anti-aliasing over its console counter parts.  However, it is a bit of a let down that it does not include the soft engine or additional stages.  Hopefully, Team Ninja will patch those features in or add as DLC.  It would also be helpful if the game received keyboard mapping for any who do not use a controller with the game. Personally, I've found the PS4 controller to work flawlessly through using a utility.\n\nOn the upside at least the game still has the hair options that the last gen consoles did not receive.

The high costs for the costume pack DLCs are comming from the huge amount of costumes in each DLC. Each costume pack on Steam is a compilation of old costume packs from PS3 and PS Vita and will give most characters even multiple costumes per pack. Compared to the old costume packs in total this is even very low cost.

I used to have an X-Box, and I had DoA3 and DoA2 Ultimate back then. Haven't had the occasion to play any other of the DoA games since then, so there won't be any comparison between this version and another one.\n\nFirst of all, pay attention to what controlers you have plugged to your PC, I had my old Sidewinder on, it prevented me from getting past the autosave notice screen.\n\nMy PC isn't state of the art, and I'm playing with old Logitech Dual Action gamepads, on Windows 10.\n\nIt looks just dandy on my PC, it runs perfectly, I can put AA alright. It plays just how I remember it from the old Xbox games (excepted I've clearly lost my touch, man, I can hardly counter anything for now).\n\nI play with japanese voices and french subtitles, because usually dubbings are garbage (DoA5 defaulted on English voices for me and, apparently, the comment on dubbs is true whatever the language :p). Apparently, a part of the cast comes from Virtua Fighter 5. Some of those seem to retain an English voice, and the sound quality is different (lower). It's a detail, a bit annoying, but nothing major.\n\nThere's a few players online. Latency is equal to your and your opponent's connection, nothing more, nothing less. I've have an opponent where it was like playing  on the same computer and he was sitting next to me (zero lag or anything), and one where it played like in slow-motion, rather than usual cut-and-go lag thing. I don't know if it's a feature or not, it's not great, but at least it's playable, unlike how it usually goes.\nI heard you can't choose who you fight againstn which sounds like a bummer for those who have friends with the game too, who want to play online.\n\nPros:\n- it runs great on my computer, I've had no glitch so far either.\n- it looks pretty good still, of course you won't get all amazeballs on it, but the DOA series has its visual style that's unlikely to evolve much no matter what tech evolutions we're going to get through (excepted the monkey, what a lazy modeling job, seriously :p). More polys, better flowing hair, stuff like that, yeah. More realistic faces or whatnot? You're never going to get that with DOA.\n- It's on PC, I mean, we don't have much choices when it comes to Beat them up on PC, unless you want to sell a kidney to get the latest Street Fighter.\n- it's a DoA game - if you've ever played a DoA game and enjoyed the experience, you won't feel lost, it's more of the same, everything is the same, just updated, with a bit more of everything (34 characters or something? it seems they've added characters from other games, like some kind of cross-over game).\n\nFor the cons:\n- there's the english voices forced on the VF5 characters whatever language you pick\n- the DLC, seriously, the price? Good thing, there's only one I'd consider buying, a new character (a Samurai Warrior one, apparently). The rest is just clothes, so they're of no importance.\n- online play has no dedicated server, so connection is only as good as the worst of either players' connection.\n- apparently can't pick who you fight against online.\n- the story is pants... naaaah, seriously, who cares? :p\n- It's a DoA game - if you didn't like the previous ones for any reason, you won't like this one either.\n\nConclusion:\nSo, if you ignore all the weird people who will buy this version just to compare it to their superduper console version which was bound to be superior anyway (we're not talking about an upgrade frrom an old console game like Valkyria Chronicles, we're talking about a port from a very recent game on last generation consoles. What do you expect, seriously?), if you have no access to a console, if you played a DoA game before and enjoyed it, you're going to like it. If you're curious, give it a go, it's a pretty damn good Beat them up. It's pretty, it runs great, and it's fun.","March 31","true","11.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Yes, the extra stages are missing, and the keyboard controls are horrible.\n\nFor starters, a fighting game should be, as the genre describes, about the fighting. Just like the other versions, is the fighting fluent and flawless, and a lot of fun. The game has a lot to offer and a lot to unlock, so without a doubt, it is far from lacking in that department. Controller settings work fine, I am sure that it is a matter of remapping, but from what i understand, the controls for controllers are used fine with my friend's controller. The fact that rumble is not supported, is something i find with most PC games.\n\nThe maps look fine, work like they're supposed to, and overall bring a new element of fighting with them, which i thoroughly enjoy. Combo's can be pulled off, and chaining attacks is so much fun! Unlike a seeming majority of people, I think DOA 5: last round is a fine port, although inferior to it's console counterparts. If you only have access to a PC, definitely buy it. However, if you also have a PS4 or Xbox One, buy the game for your console.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nPros:\n---------\n- Fighting mechanics\n- Game is (in core) the same fighting game as it's console counterparts\n- A solid fighter on PC\n- A story to breeze (read 2-3 hours) through\n- Bouncing boobies (and jigglephysics)\n- Still graphically appealing\n\nCons:\n----------\n- No extra stages\n- Graphically not as good as it's console counterparts\n- Unchangeable keyboard settings\n- No online multiplayer (as of yet)\n- Not on the latest of engines\n- DLC WAY TOO EXPENSIVE\n- Barely any steam support\n\nIt is a shame that there is barely any steam support on the game, and the DLC prices MUST be adressed. I'm not paying 50+ euro's for just a couple of costumes, no matter how many there are in a pack. Even though this is the same story on it's console counterparts, TECMO MUST ADRESS THEIR DLC PRICES.\n\nThe controls for keyboards play fine for me, although a possibility for changing your controls must be adressed. If you want a solid fighter for PC (whatever your reason is), the base game would do fine. I recommend the game for anyone not able to play on consoles, but play the base game only. there is no need paying an additional 100+ euro's to unlock just a couple more costumes. Either they cut their packs into smaller DLC packs for individual characters (for a fraction of the price), or the DLC is not worth getting.\n\nFinal verdict:\n-----------\n6/10","March 30, 2015","false","51.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It took several years from Team Ninja to respond but I can say I am glad they finally did.\n\nDead or Alive 5 Last Round is the third and final editon of the excellent Dead or Alive 5. Bringing the roster up to 35 playable characters with some extra alternate costumes and unlockable Dead or Alive 1 music for good measure.  On Playstation 4 and Xbox One, it also sports two additional stages and a different graphical engine which are not included here for reasons unclear. The latter missing feature however I doubt most will really noitice. On the PC side of things, the title offers a good amount of graphic options and while my PC is barely in the recommended specifications, it feels like my PC was hardly put under any stress while it was running, like the recommended specifications should be lower than they are on the storepage.\n\nHere is a graphics comarison:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LcYNItNuak\n\nThe Dead or Alive series is a 3-D fighting game series revovling around punches, kicks, throws and counters while using the enviroment to your advantage, and Dead or Alive 5 is no exception. It does however add more stage interactivity over previous entries in the series along with the new 'Power Blow' and 'Power Launcher' desperation attack types. Last Round does not add anything new to the game mechanics but does offer a character roster rebaance in an attempt to make the game more balanced competitively. The PC version however feels exceptionally responsive when using a wired Xbox 360 controller, moreso than Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate on Playstation 3 did for me.\n\nMode-wise we have the same unchanged story mode from the original Dead or Aive 5, which is interesting but I never really felt inclinded to replay it since the original DOA5 release, despite the level side missions. A versus section including versus mode, arcade mode, time attack, survival mode, and team battle (most of which suport single fighter and tag-team fights. The training mode section offers tutorials, command-list training, and combo training on top of your standard training mode. The is a extra's section where you can rewatch replay and cutscenes along with some other stuff. Lastly there are music and options menus which let you modify the game to better suit your liking, with music letting you play around with what music you hear in the game and when.\n\nThe elephant in the room here is online play: Its not available yet. I'll update this review when its available but so far the game runs as well as I could have hoped for it to run. The only thing really bothering me that is missing is steam cloud support so I don't ever have to re-unlock content in the fututre in the event something unforseen happens.\n\nLastly, is this port for you? It depends if you can put up with some missing content and wait for online play. The majority of the games flaws can easily be patched away, so my con list may shrink in the future,\n\nPros:\n- Good variety of graphic settings\n- Runs smoother than the recommended specs suggest\n- Controls are very responsive\n- Selectable Dead or Alive 1 OST trakcs added\n- More costumes added to the base game than in the previous iteration\n\nCons:\n- Keyboard controls are not rebindable\n- Two stages missing from Playstation 4/Xbox One versions\n- Absurdly overpriced DLC costumes\n- No Steam Cloud Support\n- No Achievements\n- Album Mode in the Extra's menu is a lie\nhttp://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=416735845","March 30, 2015","true","10.5"," 43 of 88 people (49%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","49","43","88","9","5"

I don't care that their DLC is overpriced and some of them aren't even fully working like their console versions. At this point you're probably wondering why.. Or you pressed "Not helpful" and already left.. Anyway, the reason why I don't care about these issues is because I've already acknowledged the fact that Tecmo Koei doesn't give a toss about their PC fans. If you're able to get past that reality, you'll have a fantastic, fast-paced fighting game on your hands.\n\nI personally love the Dead or Alive series, for the arousal and the standard pleasure it has managed to give me over the years. Dead or Alive 5 Last Round works like the previous games, fast-paced and smooth combat with jiggly breast physics and silly "Story" mode filled with cliche that might make you cringe.\n\nIf you're not familiar with fighting games, I totally recommend this one for you. The mechanics are easy to learn, each character works very differently so it'll be challenging to adapt playing with each one. There's also plenty of gamemodes to pick from to keep you busy. DLC is overpriced (as mentioned before) but it's all cosmetics anyway so it's not like you're missing out on anything really.\nBesides, the game itself includes many unlockable costumes per each character, no need to pay for anything there. It'll also take quite a while to unlock all of those costumes, so you'll surely be kept busy.\n\nIf fighting games in general aren't your thing, I'm sure waifus are. This game will most likely satisfy your needs,\nwhatever those needs may be.\nIt's a scientifically proven fact anyways, that 99% of the non-females who bought this game, bought it for TIDDEYS.\n\n(Also, if you've read this far and you already own the game.. Zack frightens me. Help me please.)\n\nHave a good one lads !\n\nHONOKA IS THE ULTIMATE WAIFU HONOKA IS THE ULTIMATE WAIFU HONOKA IS THE ULTIMATE WAIFU HONOKA IS THE ULTIMATE WAIFU HONOKA IS THE ULTIMATE WAIFU","November 28, 2015","true","70.1"," 26 of 54 people (48%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","48","26","54","5","12"

Acually no, and, here is why. i like a fighting game that i can play for like maybe 30 minutes and then put down to play something different. This game does that, the match's are fast and even on my mid range PC runs very well. I am not a texture person or really someone who cares what the backrounds look like. Yes, sometimes when i see the muddy textures of a pole i think, "could of been better", but really it does not matter to me. I like the gameplay of the game, the fighting is fast and fluid and running at 60FPS. Now for people who play this game online and battle with other people might be put off. But me i would say to my friend come over with a gamepad and lets play some DOA on my 27" monitor, Although if i do that i might need a bigger setup or something.","March 31, 2015","true","39.6"," 18 of 38 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","18","38","0","0"

Dead or Alive 5 was my very favorite game in the series to the point where I was willing to shell out large amounts of money for  both of its glorified expansions.  I am very disappointed however in the quality of the PC port of DOA5 Last Round.  The graphics look last gen, online play is unavailable for the first couple of months upon release, and there are as of yet no achievements.  I didn't know this going in as I preordered it soon after finding out about it as my PC is the only system I have that can play "next gen" titles.  This does not ruin the fact that the core gameplay is very fun, but it is a disappointment, and seemingly a result of rushed and sloppy porting.  There are a massive amount of costumes, levels and characters in this verion and even an extra move or two.  Some of the costumes are quite nice, such as the casual, halloween, and ninja outfits, but some seem incredibly similar (I get that fanservice has always been a part of the appeal to many, but how many different bikinis do you really need?)  Overall, If you haven't played DOA offline yet, it may warrant purchasing as of now, but for those wanting the full experience off the get go, I would highly recommend waiting a couple of months or buying the PS4 or XBONE version (last gen consoles' online communities are probably very dead).  9/10 for the gameplay, 6/10 for the port quality.","April 1, 2015","false","37.0"," 17 of 36 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","17","36","0","0"

Fluid 60fps gameplay which isn't too demanding on systems. The high resolution options and the availability of super sampled anti-aliasing make this game sharper looking than any of the console versions. Admittedly, it would be nice to be able to select an arbitrary resolution, so hopefully this will be patched in. The texture work is pretty solid all round too, although, being a last gen console titile originally, it doesn't compete with the latest games.\n\nControls:\nQuick and responsive. The game plays well, but it does have mapping issues with some controllers and could really benefit from the ability to remap all button, e.g. start and back.\n\nGameplay:\nIt's a Dead or Alive game. Fast, responsive fighting has always been the trademark of this series, and this version appears no different. It also has the largest character roster in the series history, with a mix of new characters alongside stalwarts from the DoA and Virtua Fighter series. If you're a fan of the series then you can't really go wrong here.\n\nCaveats:\nThe game is missing features from the PS4 version. Two stages are gone and so is the "Soft Engine", i.e. the enhanced boob physics. Also not present at launch is the online multiplayer mode, which Team Ninja have promised to patch in and is the biggest flaw at present.\n\nOverall:\nWhile not quite as good as could be hoped, and despite Tecmo's woeful lack of communication pre-release, this is a solid port of an excellent game. It has plenty to recommend for fight fans, if you can overlook the missing features.\n","March 30, 2015","true","17.9"," 16 of 34 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","16","34","0","0"

I've played some other fighting games before and the difficulty is just too high even on normal modes. DOA5LR starts you off slowly and has a pretty good slope to climb up on, so it let me play right away without getting frustrated.\n\nI think the developers kinda set the bar high for the minimum and recommended specs, too. I'm playing this on a laptop with a mid-range graphics processor, and it's running pretty smoothly especially on fullscreen even on 1080p. I've encountered a few frame rate drops on windowed, but I was running two screens with a lot of open windows at that time too.\n\nExtremely disappointed that they didn't port the current gen console version (PS4) properly though. No Steam Cloud support and Steam Achievements as well. I'm hoping they still add those, the missing levels and effects in a patch soon, but as Team Ninja's too lazy with the PC port, I can only wait...again.\n\nIn its current state, I will only recommend getting this on a sale that's even cheaper than the current 10% off, but if you're single and lonely... ¯\(°_o)/¯","March 31, 2015","true","21.4"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/artimenius/recommended/311730/","artimenius","Besputha Tomkova","http://steamcommunity.com/id/artimenius/","2596 products in account","I have mixed feelings about this one.\nI did not even care for the plot. 1stly it seems, like, you need to know what happened in previous games, but either way it seems... Well, a bit over the top and ridicolous to me. So I started skipping very soon. But, let's be honest, when did fighting games had an actually good plot? I do not remember such.\nGraphically it's ok, even thouhg it's PS3 port, rather than PS4 from what I understand. Although, to be honest, in terms of looks, I like only Mila and Tina. They seem most "real" to me, despite Tina having bigger boobs, than what she would have had IRL. Others seem too plastic and dumb-faced, IMHO. Generalizing a bit, maybe, but still. I like Mila and Tina as characters, too. Well, again, they seem more "alive" and "down to earth" somehow compared to others.\nMusic seems good, which is also important to a fighting game. Maybe not the best OST, I could think of, but my ears does not bleed and some of the tracks do really suit the mood of the fights.\nNow... For the most important thing: gameplay. Well... As usual I started with playing tutorial. I know, that most fightings have same basics, but tutorials can give hints on some more complex technics. I exited tutorial on the last part of Critical Burst or something. The one where you press Punch and Kick simultaniously. The one where you need to "follow up the Critical Burst". I thought I had to do the same thing as in previous tutorial, where I do Critical Burst, than a combo, than Critical Burst again, but... Either it did not register or something entrely else was meant. EIther way, even up to this point, Iive been noticing some issues with registering directional keys when they are required to be input inbetween punches\kicks. For example when you press Punch, Punch, Right, Punch it's oftren registers as Punch, Punch, Punch, Right. I'm using XBOX ONE controller and.. This frustrates me. Even stranger, that if I try to recreate this without touching the opponent it gets recareated.. Most of the time, but not always. Like 75% of the times it's done as expected. While with opponent odds are reversed.\nBut ok. That may be a rage quit. I checked the following tutorials simply by names and there seem to be some more advanced technics in there. Instead of trying those, though, I decided to start the story mode and return to tutorial, if I feel AI too strong to handle withouth finishing it. Well... Button mashing. Maybe not exactly, but it works. I mean in Mortal Kombat, for example, you needed to do complex combos and use skills to finish AI opponents. Here - just punch and kick randomly, while using directions to switch High\Mid\Low attacks to break through guard. That's it. Drive opponent into the corner and just use quick jabs and uppercauts (when opponent is down). That is it. Maybe it will become harder closer to the end, but so far difficulty seems to rise up mainly because the new opponent has different body type and you need to get used to his\her animations.\nBut suprisingly it felt... Fine. The kind of fine, that you can get from DMC games, if you just mash the buttons. You still get through, not artistically enough, but you disable your brain for a moment and just let it out. It does give some satisfaction. Primal one, very simplistic, but still - satisfaction. And again, there are more advanced moves in there, that are quite hard to master, so you can up your own game.\nSo, I will mark it as recommended. It is a quick fix, just to blow some steam off and watch some jigglies. After all animation is pretty good (although boobs seem to jiggle too much even with "natural" settings. And characters do have different body types, seem to have different speed and thus do actually feel a bit different when playing them.\n\nBut, my advise: wait for a discount. Like 50% or more. And do not bother with those costume packs, which cost evenmore than the game itself. If you have that much money to waste - better give it to me ;)","March 31, 2015","true","1.2"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","0"

However, the only problem I have with DOA is the excessive amount of fan service in the form of costumes.  They can make the game look rather juvinile to onlookers at times, which is annoying.  Ignoring those, DOA has a very deep, satisfying, and fun fighting system that strikes the best balance between being button mash friendly for new comers, but also accomodates a very high level of advanced play for those who put in the time.  The moves and graphics are really flashy as well, makes you feel like you're part of a movie.  As for DOA5 in particular, from my experience every entry in the series is clearly superior to all the entries before it, and DOA5 is no exception.  Some fighting game series' aren't so fortunate, and their effort to appeal to a broader audience sacrifices the gameplay quality at the high level.  DOA5 somehow dodged this pitfall, and remains a great game.\n\nThe PC port:\n\nContrary to what many reviews here have stated, from my experience the quality of the PC port is actually quite good.  It runs very smooth and looks amazing, even on old/slow hardware.  My midrange AMD laptop from 2011 plays the game perfectly at 60fps and that says something.  I haven't noticed any bugs or crashes either, which often happens with poor port jobs.  I know there are some features missing from this version, but all of them except for 1 really aren't a big deal at all.  The game is still tons of fun and looks/plays great.  The only glaring feature that I think may impact a purchase is the missing online multiplayer.  However, this will be added within 3 months, and I'd rather play the game offline now and get multiplayer later, than for the entire game to be delayed 3 months.  Thinking of this as a preview release of the game helps things in my mind.\n\nI absolutely recommend this game to both newcomers and veterans of the series.","March 31, 2015","true","36.7"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","11","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tenshu89/recommended/311730/","tenshu89","Tenshu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tenshu89/","180 products in account","The first proper Dead or Alive game on the PC. How does it fare? It's actually a pretty good port. A lot of reviews are... I'd have to say "whining" about two stages being cut and no achievements. The latter may be added later for people that like to get those things.\n\nAs for the game itself. It looks pretty. The characters, which are arguably the most important asset in the game, all look fantastic even if they're using PS3 textures, the shadowing makes up for it imo. It's the same trick used in the past two Dynasty Warriors games Koei has ported to PC: Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends Complete Edition and Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires. This does indicate that perhaps Koei just doesn't know much about PC porting in general, whether it's Team Ninja or Omega Force, but it gets by. If you're looking for eye candy, the game's like a light version of something like Dragon Age: Inquisition. The game is pretty stable, I'm running a budget build at 1080p with 2k shadows and full AA, it looks great. I did get one crash in Story Mode but ever since then it hasn't given me any problems.\n\nAs for the gameplay if you're just a fighting game fan or just semi-interested in the genre, the gameplay's pretty solid. Nothing too hard to get used to, no knowing of any strengths to punches and kicks, but do note that everyone can counterhold almost any attack you throw out. However this comes with a rock-paper-scissors type of mechanic where a Strike wins over a Throw, a Throw wins over a Counter, and a Counter wins over a Strike. You can freely move around no problem with most characters and can side step, making defense in this game very easy to get into. As for offense, every character has an assortment of moves that can extend combos depending on circumstances such as stun and critical stun. The game itself has an extensive tutorial mode that delves into the deeper mechanics as well.\n\nThe music is very mood setting, it gets you into the fight. The sound effects are satisfying. Nothing seems to be downgraded at all in this port, though you do hear a change in quality if a Virtua Fighter character talks but that's something minor.\n\nThe controls are decent. Keyboard warriors may have a tough time, even if this game is incredibly accessible to a keyboard user by design. For a controller, I don't know if anyone's had this same issue, but the XB360's left analog stick seems to register a bit too sensitively with the game, slightly tilting it to left or right on the character select makes it cycle too fast so if that bugs you, just use the D-pad, there's not many intricate movements or combos where you'd want the stick anyway.\n\nI like the game myself and for the price, I'll be honest I think even WITH an Online mode later, it should remain at $35.99. While there is cut content (not essential at all, but hey it's still missing content) and the game uses shading trickery to look better, it'd fall between the pricing of Blazblue: Continuum Shift Extend and Ultra Street Fighter IV/King of Fighters XIII. It's a great game, easy to pick up and play. If you somehow like fighting game stories, the game's story mode isn't like Mortal Kombat 9's even though it tries to be, you'll be done with the story mode in a couple of hours, the rest of the game itself is great. If you want a nice 3D fighter on PC, this is a safe bet and if you're a DOA fan that hasn't been able to play a DOA game since DOA2, this has a lot of things carried over with some new moves and new mechanics. Hopefully the later Online patch will show if the game was well balanced.\n\nOn a numbers scale, I'd rate this a 7/10. Definitely get it if you have the spare money but only if you want a good 3D fighter or are a fan of DOA, otherwise do snag it when it goes on sale.\n\nAlso here are my PC's specs if you want to gauge it against your own:\nAMD FX-6300 @4.4GHz\nGTX 750Ti SC 2GBVRAM\n8GB RAM\nHave the game stored on a HDD\nWindows 7 Ultimate 64-bit","March 30, 2015","true","70.0"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","0"

It's a good game series that I'd like to see come to PC. They've told us for over a month now that multiplayer wouldn't make it in on release. I'm fine with that. I'd rather have single player now than have them delay the whole game another month. I don't begrudge them for not having multiplayer working yet. I really don't mind them not wasting the effort to have keyboard support. Trying to play a 3d fighting game with a keyboard is like trying to play an fps with a controller. They told us about not having the soft engine. I looked up videos comparing the game with and without it; I couldn't tell the difference. The game still looks great. It's not just a port from the old console versions. They have a pretty decent graphics options menu for a first time port.

It's a good game series that I'd like to see come to PC. They've told us for over a month now that multiplayer wouldn't make it in on release. I'm fine with that. I'd rather have single player now than have them delay the whole game another month. I don't begrudge them for not having multiplayer working yet. I really don't mind them not wasting the effort to have keyboard support. Trying to play a 3d fighting game with a keyboard is like trying to play an fps with a controller. They told us about not having the soft engine. I looked up videos comparing the game with and without it; I couldn't tell the difference. The game still looks great.

This iteration features over 30 characters to choose from with 19 stages in this specific port (Danger Zone and Crimson are missing). The Three Button system allows the game to be highly accesible, with a key feature being able to parry an attack during combos and strings.  There's a lot more mechanics for those looking to take their game to the next level such as new types of stuns, Power Launchers, Critical Bursts and more.  Like the other Versions it features modes such as Story, Challenge, Training, Versus (1v1/Tag), Survival(1v1/Tag), Time Attack(1v1/Tag), and Team Battle. The PC port doesn't have Online out the gate, but it is coming eventually. Even if you plan on playing solo there are tons of modes and unlocks to you busy, of course nothing beats playing against other people.\n\nGraphics:\n\nWhile this version doesn't feature the Soft Engine or particle effects from the current gen consoles, it still manages to actually look better than the other two in some ways thanks to AA, better shadows and resolutions. So yeah if your worried about this not being a looker, then you can put your mind at ease.\n\nSound:\n\nThis game features both an English and Japanese dub, and an OST that includes music from DOA1 all the way to it current incarnation that your allowed to customize no less!\n\nOverall:\nIf your looking for a really good 3D fighter o PC seriously look no further. Yes it's missing some features but they are minor at best. No online is gonna hurt for a bit but it is coming and honestly that should be the only deal breaker here. If you decide to take the plunge despite all the cons you'll be rewarded with a really awesome 3D fighting game with great sound, visuals, and most importantly gameplay!\n\n+3D Fighter on Steam\n+Accesible with challenge for those looking for it.\n+Lots of characters\n+Lots of Stages\n+Lots of Modes\n+Tons of Costumes\n+Awesome OST\n+Dual audio voice tracks\n+Pretty Visuals\n\n-Config Launcher\n-Missing two Stages\n-No Soft Engine (though I could care less)\n-No Online (yet)","March 31, 2015","true","23.6"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","10","22","0","0"

At the beginning I tried some characters and used only button mashing to beat the opponents. This worked quite well for the weaker AI difficulties. The moves which this method unleashed were still impressive. But with increasing difficulty you have to understand the fighting mechanics of the game. There are many tutorials to get to know the rock/paper/scissor like system of the game totally unique in the fighting genre and learn the characters in various training modes. In most combat situations you can do something, even when you get stuned. Usually you have a wide variety of options. Fore someone new to this game like me it is not easy to make the right decisions. But if you manager to counter a challenging opponent the resulting punishment for the enemy will be terrible and looks amazing. Sometimes I was able to turn the tide of the fight right before I was going too loose badly. That's really fun.\n\nEvery character has its own moves and combos. Some character share the same martial art but they are all unique. Characters are also specialized on a field of the rock/paper/scissor system. Some fighters have special mechanics and stances making them totally distinguishable from the other fighters. I find the character roster multifaceted and it is fun playing different ones. As a result there variety of constellations for a fight. There is also a tag mode for doing a two on two where marvellous tag combos can be done.\n\nThere are plenty of stages to fight in. Two stages are missing from the PS4/X1 version of the game, but this has no real impact. There is a desert, a jungle, a temple, a castle stage, some fighting rings and so on. Most important the stages are part of the fight and not just simple background. You can smash your opponent against obstacles and walls making special combos possible. So even the positioning is important in this fighter. There is nothing worse to have one's back to the wall, especially when it's some kind of electric fence. Also some stages can even break down so an opponent will be thrown down a level. Sometime there are also some cool short cutscenes when a fighter was thrown off the stage with some interactivity for both fighters deciding in which favour they land on the ground. The stage interactivity is outstanding in this game.\n\nAltogether I really enjoyed the game right from the beginning. Some people say it is easy to learn, but difficult to master. I can fully agree with that. The game runs stable and has an impressive graphic and high quality animations. Plus the fighting mechanics are deep and well-thought-out. If you want to smash down your opponents with awesome moves or want to dig deeper in the game and do the really eye-catching combos, then you should not miss this great 3D fighter :-)\n\nA few last words in regard to the negative reviews. Don't take them too seriously. The game may have some issues, but there is nothing crucial. Most of them complain about missing features which the publisher announced and stated in the store page round about two weeks before release of the game. They still bought the game despite knowing of the missing features. There are two possible conclusions. They wanted to waste their money for a negative review or they still wanted to play this game for whatever reasons. So, what do you think?","March 31, 2015","true","418.7"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","10","22","0","0"

I was pleased to see it was coming to pc since i don't own consoles anymore. The port is bad but it runs good though. There's stupid stuff like picture album telling you to go to the steam overlay for the album, lol. It crashed once during the story mode, and at some point, Helena had a furiously fast rotating helicopter rotor on her head. This was during a cutscene.\nAlso Hayabusha had a big cilinder as a head when shooting down a helicopter during another cut.\nYou can barely change any graphics options, and the game looks dated. Content in the game is low compared to other beat m ups of the past few years. I bet totalbiscuit would destroy this game in his review ;).\n\nAnyway, ignoring al that, gameplay wise it seems to be al there. I enjoy it, like i did al those years ago. It's just a shame a game like this didn't get a little more love from the devs when porting.\nThumbs up, but only if you know what you are getting and really want it.

So far no stability issues either.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's the gameplay that will keep you coming back.  If you like the DOA style, this game should be right up your alley.

But alas here's my review for it.\n\n\nFirst off, I would like to point out.  The game is a lot cheaper then it is on Console.  A total of 35 bucks to be exact.  Definitely better then a lot of games where u need to pay over 50 dollars for a game.\n\n\nThe gameplay itself is very smooth and i rarely had any framerate drops if any at all.  It is very enjoyable to play as the characters with the smooth mechanics, not to hard to master anyone if you know what your doing.    I saw very little issues in the gameplay itself.   and i rather enjoyed the game, as i didn't have to worry about petty achievements that Playstation Network and Xbox Live have forced upon us in this day and age.   and personally i find a game more enjoyable and fun, without achievements.  and when the gameplay is rather smooth.\n\n\nand like any DOA game.  the designs,  animations, graphics are really beautiful for this era.  and i really like the designs of the characters.  the story too is really good even if a bit corny at times.\n\n\n\nRant:\nAs some may or may not realize, it had to go through the greenlight system to get Approved which is not cheap, thus why the DLC bundles are so expensive and cost more then the game itself. and Unlike PSN,  Steam has never once sold Individual DLC for specific characters, thus why they're all in bundles.  So its understandable why Tecmo Koei put them at the prices they are, so they don't go bankrupt.  This way they have more chances to make more games in the future.\n\n\n\nWhile i am disappointed they removed the 2 extra stages and the soft-engine that the PS4 and I think Xbox One use for the game,  i believe they removed them for stability reasons.  So gamers would have less issues playing the game.  as this would  cause issues with the Vram, and Hardrive space.  causing more bugs then what little bugs are already in the game.  This would especially be evident on low-end PCS, and not everyone has a High End PC that is meant for gaming.  so this was probably done for that.\n\n\n\nRegarding the lack of why we did not get online mode or the achievements immediately which by the looks of things we will be getting fairly soon.   importing a game into a PC is not as easy as it looks. as certain things would cause stability issues as I mentioned before.  so they had to mess with things so they can put these features into the game later on down the road,  of course they will not be there immediately.  as this is new to Tecmo Koei.  their mainly known for console games,  this is  one of their 4 games they have put on Steam and are still learning.  So given that i say online and achievements are secondary when it comes to gameplay,  enjoying the game, and the story mode.\n\n\n\nFinally.  The game does not suffer any crashes as far as i have experienced so this is another Plus for the game.  As Koei did not half-♥♥♥ it like Bethesda did for Skyrim.  thus less crashes for the game.\n\n\nRant Over.\n\n\nNow the only NEGATIVES i really have with the game is the occasional glitch or 2.  but that is minor compared to everything else in the game.   Sure u can't customized your keyboard gameplay settings or your gamepad if you use one.  and for some people who use Low-end Laptops or PCS in general.   they may suffer Lip-synching problems but if you keep your PC well maintained this will fix this somewhat.\nI personally use Ccleaner and Smart Defrag.\n\nOverall the Game gets an 8 out of 10 in my book.  Would i recommend this?  Yes.  to any Fan of the Dead or Alive Series, this game is honestly a fun and enjoyable game.  and i would recommend it to fans of the series.","May 26, 2015","true","69.3"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

Watch a graphics comparison, the ps3/ps4 version's main difference is resolution, and even then it's nearly impossible for me to tell the two apart, so this version isn't gimped in the significant way. It seems to play well enough on my mid range pc, only frame drops are win/loss poses. My processor is an i3 2100, so you don't need much to run this game. I'm using an xbox controller and that seems to work well enough.

You're complaining about useless achivements, quality that looks terrific, and VIBRATIONS!! The online is understandable but I couldn't give a damn because I run into problems with the online on all fighting games on Steam! Both of Netherrealms fighting games online was trash because there is never anyone to fight! But this is a Dead or Alive review so let's stay on track. So far this is the only 3D side stepping fighting game on steam (at least that I know of) and the controlls feel great and are easy to understand for anyone who can't do fighting games very well. So Koei Tecmo dosn't love PC gamers? It's understandable to feel rejected for not getting the same treatment but it's still a great for when you are tired of all the 2d fighting games. I suggest if you have 2 controllers for pc that you invite all your friends, challenge them and make fun of whoever dosn't want play. Then play in a king of the hill fashion where losers swaps and tries to take down whoever the winner is. Or just swap the controllers over to whoever wants to fight so everyone fights someone they're equal to.

And yet, it manages to keep even fighting game veterans around with its' combat system that heavily relies on reflexes and less on finnicky inputs like in Tekken for example.\n\nThat doesn't mean that ALL characters have easy inputs! Be prepared to spend quite some time in training mode if you want to master a difficult character.\n\nIt manages to keep you motivated with a fighting engine that simply feels satisfying when you land even the simplest of combos.\n\nThe story mode isn't anything interesting to say the least but there are cutscenes, so you can see that the devs put some degree of effort in, which I can appreciate. There are some quirky ones in there. While I wasn't a big fan of those scenes, I'm sure that they can be entertaining for other people.\n\nThere's a wide range of fighters to your disposal, all with different ways of fighting, there's prety much something for everyone in there. I own the original DOA5 on PS3 and I can say that this is definitely worth picking up even if you own an earlier version, the new characters are a lot of fun.\n\nNow, on to the most important part: ONLINE MODE\nSadly, pretty much nobody is playing this game anymore. The implementation of online mode got delayed so much that most people ran out of patience, which is completely understandable. And to top it off, there are no player matches, only ranked ones. So you can't even make a private lobby to play with friends which leads to the question:\n\nWhy did you even make an online mode if it's gonna be incomplete?\n\nThe netcode is ok and I haven't really experienced any gamebreaking lag in the ranked matches I played, so why did it have to be like this, I wonder?\n\nAt this rate, the chances for another DoA port for PC in the future are looking grim.\n\nWhich is why I'd like to encourage you all to give this game a try.\nIt's not like you have to buy the ridiculously overpriced DLC <- Seriously, don't.\n\nAnd about the girls,\n\nWell, I'll let you be the judge of that. It's DoA.\nPersonally, I can be honest to myself and say that I enjoy looking at video game girls showing alot of skin, especially when they have amazing models (they really do).","November 16, 2015","true","15.7"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Runs like a dream.\n\nJust a note:\n\nI've been using a XBOX360 Controller as my input device and my System hardware comfortably exceeds the recomended requirements;  so as far as I can tell, the game runs perfectly.\n\nAs for the fight engine, you can't really fault it.  It's the same formula that's been refined and tweaked ever so slightly from its inception, so whether you played since DOA2 or just now picked it up, you'll be pleased to know that you are getting the same classic DOA experience.  So re-acquainting yourself will come very easily.  If you are new to the game, it's easy to pick up, and can be challenging to master.\n\nAs for the things the game lacks, 2 stages and a soft engine.  Hardly deal breakers IMO.  36 stages are already a lot, and most of them are quite dynamic with environmental hazards and multiple tiers.\n\nIf I were to make a criticism it would be about the lighting, but it would be from a perspective of design choice.  The devs wanted the game to look, feel and play like something fantastical, but somehow the characters always look like they are apart from the environments they are fighting in, rather than immersed in them.\n\nAs always, the story is non-sensical, but that is the hurdle that most fighting games fail to surmount.  Fighting is the mechanic, so of course when you throw individuals from the largest DOA cast ever, into situations that can only end in a fight, their reasons for doing so vary from whimsical, farcical and... well, typical.\n\nThe stock game comes with heaps of costumes, which is already more than most fight games of its genre, but if you want to purchase more, be prepared to pay a premium for them with Tecmo Koei releasing 2 sets of DLC which already exceed the cost of the game.\n\nFinally, once you beat the game, all that's left is to polish your skills on the various game modes until they release the online component; but in the interim, just have your friends over and play with them - zero lag and the purest experience.","March 31, 2015","true","19.8"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

I should have waited but I was stupid and paid full. For me, there has been no issues with the game play or the graphics. If you were waiting for the PC version this is good and enjoyable.\nFor some, the lack of steam achievements and on-line play (coming in 3 months) could be an issue.

Everything you need to know about the system mechanics from the different stuns and stagger states, to the power crush system are all explained in this mode that will get you up to speed if you're new to this game, or an old veteran who has missed out on the last couple of games.\n\nAs for the graphics, I personally think it looks better than the X1 or PS4 versions since you can supersample from a higher resolution and remove the need for anti-aliasing altogether (if your hardware supports it). The end result is a real clean looking image that you can only find on the PC version of this game.\n\nThe game runs at a locked 60 FPS on my system with no issues (i7 2600k, 16GB RAM, GTX 780). You'll only see it drop to 30 FPS during cutscenes and match introductions. This may have been something left in from the PS3/X360 era as those scenes needed to look better than the in-game graphics for that generation with underpowered hardware, so they increased image quality at the expense of the framerate for those specific scenes. It may be jarring for some people, but it's something I can easily brush off since it doesn't affect gameplay at all.\n\nNow for the problems that I've had with this game include the issue of not natively supporting Xinput devices such as Xbox360 controllers and joysticks. The problem is that this game uses the outdated direct input method to detect controllers and that leads to some compatibility issues in getting keyboards and controllers working properly.\n\nI use a MadCatz TE joystick and a Hori RAP V3SA joystick. Both of them have messed up button placements when used with this game. The face buttons are in a weird scrambled order where the A and the B buttons are on the top row and the X and Y buttons are on the bottom, which makes menu navigation odd, but not impossible once you get used to it. In game, you can reconfigure the different attack buttons to match whatever configuration you like, that is not an issue in this game at all. I can set my buttons to the standard 3 buttons and be done with it once I'm in game.\n\nIf you're a keyboard warrior, you may have more issues than a controller user in this game as the keys used in-game are all locked to a specific configuration. If they decide to patch the input issues, hopefully this will be fixed as well and let keyboard players reconfigure their controls to their preference.\n\nIgnore the DLC, it's all cosmetic stuff that they won't split up for some reason. Not everyone out there who plays this game wants to pay $120 for extra costumes, especially for characters I rarely use or don't care about. I guess Koei Tecmo would rather make $0 instead of an extra $5 or $10 per user by not offering the costume packs a la carte.\n\nThe verdict? buy it in 3 months when it is on sale for 50% or more unless you really want to play a solid 3D fighting game on PC right now and don't mind the lack of online versus mode.\n","April 8, 2015","true","5.1"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

This game runs smooth on my entry-class rig (shadows enabled, 720P+FXAA). so I think that's an OKAY call. But then again, they should at LEAST add an option to enable or disable the softengine for higher spec users (If it requires more power, that is.) And they should really allow modders. Some people like myself, I'm contented with the game as it is. But please, Tecmo, at least give users modding support so that they at least can customize and configure the game to their liking. And the lack of online play (Which will be released this end of June) really is a bit disappointing. But all in all, the game might be missing some features, but it still retained its quality of action. My suggestion is for Tecmo to release a patch where users can modify freely their advanced graphics option.\n\nPROS:\n+ Zack.\n+ High replay value\n+ Combo chains are creative\n+ You can play a character for 20+ hours before getting bored of them. And the roster is huge.\n+ Community is "Alright" (Besides those who keeps complaining).\n+ Taunts.\n+ Camera mode is fun to play around with.\n+ Tag teaming!\n+ Megane!\n+ Zack has an island.\n\nCONS:\n- Zack.\n- Missing features, albeit not "Game-changing", can ruin the atmosphere for others.\n- NO ONLINE LOBBIES. (Yet).\n- Cutscenes could've been redone in 60 FPS tho, but wtv. Most console ports are like that anyway.\n- EXPENSIVE COSTUME SETS.\n- Rarely updates, but most crashes might have been fixed already.\n- Lack of advanced in-game settings. No advanced graphics options for those who want to enable advanced effects.\n- Zack has an island..

I have a high End system. i7 4790k gtx 970's blah blah blah the rest is just not important. The point is it's a good system. The menus seemed really nice and they trick you into thinking the controls will work equally as nice. To anyone with a arcade stick.

Just mash everything and be happy. If you're a bit more advanced, combos and hard stuff uses a bunch of directionals. Gameplay is really fun and refreshing if you're used to classic 6-keys.\n• Story mode is a mess. Seriously, I had no idea of wtf was happening with so many scene changes here and there.

On the fighter side of things, DOA is an arcade styled button smash fighter with chaining combos, blocks, combo breakers, etc as commonly found in this genre. The idea to be good and have fun at it is based on the user. On the other side of fighting, DOA throws strong sex appeal out there, which I enjoy as opposed to looking at Goro's 4 armpits. On the rewarding side of things, DOA rewards you for accomplishments with outfits... some skimpier and some fetished. All good with me. The only people that play DOA are the people that enjoy these things.\nIf you like DOA games, you'll like this one. If you like fighting games and great big breastesies, you'll like this one. I enjoyed it. I like the arcade styled game play of DOA, always have. If you like fighting games and eye candy then this is the game for you. However compared to other DOA games... falls short.\n\nGameplay - 8\nFighting - 9\nGraphics - 7\nControls - 2\nStory - 3\nFeatures - 0<\n\nGameplay is as you can expect from fighter games, all relatively the same and its good.\nThe fighting, the style, combos, etc. are DOA par which is epic.\nGraphics, I was expecting a bit more. I mean its eye appealing, but DOA always has been so nothing special here.\nControls are gonna but hurt some. At this moment the controller support is bugged for some. Google it.\nThe story was confusing, I could have gone without it. Plot hole much? But if your gonna put it in the game, atleast make it flow.\nThere are no new features and some features we've expected aren't there. No photo sessions at this time. No free roam camera.\n\nOverall I give this game a 6.5/10 on the basis of it being a common fighting game with appealing characters. However as the fighting game pool on PC is a bit slim, this game is my favorite. On a bell curve of the rest of the fighter pool this game would be the 10.\n\nBut to hell with that expensive DLC with out a photo booth.","June 20, 2015","true","11.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The fighting for me is the closest thing to Tekken out of the PC games available and this is what I grew up playing. Story mode takes you through a twisting story where you get to try out all the different characters a great way of introducing you to the game and finding the characters you like. For local games you can play 1on1 or tag which allows for a bit more variation and some unstoppable combos when swapping through your characters.\n\nNot so good point - The graphics and selection of settings aren't as good as they could be but that's what happens with a console port I don't think the appearance is enough reason not to buy the game but if you had been waiting a long time for a higly polished game then you wil be dissapointed.\n\nI bought this in the steam sale so the price was reasonable and my only expectations where from watching the trailer on steam so from that I am very happy with this game.\n\nThe graphics may have been better if they hadn't put a huge team of developers concentrating on boob physics and overpriced DLC costumes, most girlfriends won't approve of this game!","June 18, 2015","true","26.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

And the impossible request from the Dev Team... "Please don't mod our game..." is like telling a smoker with a cigarette in his mouth not to light that cig... You just can not expect pc users NOT to mod certain games, it's just inevitable, and a down right impossible request.\n\nNow the game runs smoothly for me, even with mods, a normal wired Microsoft Xbox 360 controller works great, also my Xbox ONE controller works just fine as well with the micro-USB cable, now I've seen around the internets that there are some issues with it but I've had none so far, I was even able to use BOTH controllers connected at the same time, THOUGH it detected the Xbox 360 controller as the 1st Player, no matter what, even if I plugged the Xbox ONE controller first or second, not a big deal though.\n\nOther than that, I love the game, with mods, it's easily expandable it gives the game some longevity, 7/10","June 4, 2015","true","11.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","1"

Then played it on the Xbox. Then I went to the pc and never played it again. Now that it`s on the PC, I jumped at the chance to play the game again after all these years.\n\nNow I don`t know what this game is like on the console versions, I`ve heard it`s quite a bit better on them and that the pc version loses some extras. That`s bad.\n\nHowever, played as it is, it`s a rip-roaring fun beat em up! Pretty much in the smae style as I remember it years ago.\n\nPlus points:\n1. Sexy females in all kinds of sexy attire that can be freed up.\n2. Great arenas with some dynamics to them that change the flow of the combat.\n3. Excellent male characters too for when you`re tired of playing with the girls.\n4. Ok storyline.\n\nI like the fact that the game keeps to its traditional sexy female fighters routine. Yea, it`s silly watching these women take on tough, grizzled men and somehow able to beat them, but that`s the fantasy world of Dead or Alive and the men of course hit back just as hard.\n\nThe eye candy female costumes are great and I love how it makes no apologies for it. Instant buy over other beat-em ups (like Mortal Kombat X) just because they are not like most Western cowardly game makers today who change everything at the mere whiff of sjws or fembots whines.\n\nThey could`ve skimped on the males, but they are well thought out with a good variety. You can choose the nervous teenage boy who literally collapses at the sight of a pair of boobs, to a bare chested oil-worker to an old man to the rugged Spetnatz type fighter who knows nothing but fighting in wars- all with their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe fight mechanics are solid and on the higher difficulties you`ll find yourself more concerned about surviving a fight than staring at the girls as they can give you a real battle. That`s when your muscle-memory comes into play. You`ll be left almost feeling like you had a real fight sometimes. I particularly like how sweat runs off them quite realistically after a particular battle. You can have tag battles and Survival and Arcade mode plus Story mode.\n\nStory mode is `meh`, you go through the story and find silly reasons to beat each other up, sons will fight fathers, sisters will beat eachother to a pulp, etc, typical stuff. After story mode is done that`s it. I was hoping you could go through again with different characters and costumes, but apparently not. So kind of pointless apart from doing it to free up stuff.\n\nThe arenas are varied and interesting from great snow or cliff vistas that have secondary levels to battlefields and secret laboratories. I particularly like the idol god statue that animates and the battlefield scene with the soldier shouting for the fighters to leave the battle- then start shooting anyway!\n\nThe music varies from your typical rock to some really nice almost theatrical battle music and there are even soundtracks from the original games that I recognised.\n\nYou can view short vids of your characters and even view them close after a fight.\n\nIt`s a pulse pounding exciting game that keeps to basically the same mechanic as it was when I played the PS versions over a decade ago, so very easy to jump into. Neither is it so hard (on early levels) that you need to be a StreetFighter Ace to get through it.\n\nNegatives?\n\nLike I said before I heard you lose a stage and that fighter clothing can actually tear. That would`ve been cool to see.\n\nReally negative.\n\nYep, DLCs. This is where I have to give the makers a big thumbs down. There are a lot of DLCs and some I would dearly love to buy, but the prices are ridiculously prohibitive. Does Tecmo Team Ninja actually want us to buy their DLCs?\n\nThey range from around £7 (not too bad) to nigh £50!! Most of them range from £30- £50 for what is essentially a bunch of reskins. I don`t mind paying standard price for the MAIN game, but hell will freeze over first before I pay such huge sums of money for DLC reskins for a game! I like sexy scantily clad girls as much as the next red blooded man, but I will not be taken advantage of in this way. The brain takes over here!!\n\nTheir DLCs can sit there and rot. Even half price is till way too expensive. Maybe when the prices go down to about £10 for the most expensive correspondingly, then i`ll consider them. If never, then i`ll never buy them. I just can`t understand their thinking. Boggles the mind. It don`t even make  business sense.\n\nHowever, the base game is good and has enough fighting, arenas and eye candy to satisfy. The males are well portrayed and aren`t missed out. So it gets a GREAT thumbs up.","April 13","true","0.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","3"

The DOA series has always been popular due to its over the top female character design and its simple to learn fighting system - and its all here. That being said....\n\nBAD: The game's graphics are dated. In fact, the game looks like you're running it on a PS3 emulator - Yes, PS-THREE. They're THAT OLD and DATED. And the online mode is missing, as well as two arenas. You can read official reviews that make much mention of this. The publisher has advised that it could be 3 mos. before the online mode is active.\n\nUGLY: The Price. Im sorry, but a port with PS3 era level graphics, and no options to scale them to current gaming rigs, should put this game at the $19.99 - $29.99 price point on the PC. I'll be frank, I bought my Steam version from another site for $16.00 and activated it on Steam.\n\nCONCLUSION: I recommend this game if you are a fan of the series, or just love fighting games in general. The game is not bad, as long as you can get past the old visuals. It's no Injustice or MK, but it's worthy of adding to your PC fighting game collection. JUST DON'T PAY FULL PRICE FOR IT. Don't even pay the 10% off price. They need to drop the price of this neutered port down under $30 before it's worth it.","April 4, 2015","true","9.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Runs smoothly during gameplay however the intro/outros on the fights feel capped at 30 FPS. If you want Online, then you might have to wait, if you don't need Online, then that is fine for you. Achievements are being tested and may be live soon. It's an entertaining game, if you like Dead or Alive, don't have a console, or appreciate fighting games. DLC's are bit pricey though.","August 13, 2015","true","41.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Otherwise, we won't be able to release a title for PC again." (i bet they fear that it would cut into their DLC sales). so lets get this straight: missing physics engine, missing stages, no steam cloud or achivements, and expensive DLCs and you feal like people should not mod this game? tecmo, you have guaranteed that this game will be modded, I hope it gets this living fuq modded out of it just to spite you (can't wait).\n\nif this is how tecmo plans to port it's other games to PC then i hope yosuke hayashi keeps good on his threat for this to be the last port. they have proven they know little about the PC platform and it's gamers, and even less about public relations with those gamers.\nI'll still recommend this game however, tecmo has some issues they need to work through as a company when it comes to PC\nI sure hope namco doesn't pull this crap with tekken 7.","March 31, 2015","true","25.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/needbaka/recommended/311730/","needbaka","(RADIO): Need baka.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/needbaka/","46 products in account","After playing the PC port for quite some time I will try my best to give the most unbiased review possible.\n\nDespite the controversy over the DOA5LR Port, Team NINJA/Tecmo KOEI have finally dropped the long awaited fighter of their niche title. Quite a number of fighter players and DOA veterans such as myself have been anticipating the this game to come out for PC for quite some time, so does it live up to the "hype"?\n\nFirst of all, let's start with the most important part of a fighting game, the gameplay. Does this game prove hard to play? ( massive FPS drops, game breaking glitches, etc ) I have a rather high end rig and seem to be having no issues, my specs include an Intel Core i7 4790K, GTX 970, 16 GB RAM, Game running on an SSD and I have had no problems with any of the stages regarding frame drops or strange floor glitches ( I believe it has been patched out, when the game launched I experienced some strange FPS drops on the Lorelei stage but since the patch it doesnt seem to exist ). The game even with a rig like mine seems to have some strange FPS drops sometimes in the Character Select screen, maybe because it is awkwardly locked at 30 FPS when the PS4/X1 version runs at 60 FPS, but yes in regards to gameplay the game is pretty solid given that your rig is somewhat beefy. ( Game is still pretty badly optimized in the long run unfortunately )\n\nNow let's talk about the graphics and how the game looks overall versus the PS4/X1 editions, if you have a pretty beefy rig like mine then you can get this game looking quite a bit more amazing than the current gen consoles ( a little disappointing since it should either surpass or be equal to the console versions ) if you "upscale" the game to 4K, I use Nvidia's DSR to supersample it down to 1440P and the game has almost no jaggies for the most part. Antialiasing on the PC version is obviously far more superior than the PS4/X1 ports when you take a close look at the character models but again in regards to the characters it is pretty disappointing how my PS4 version just with the way the "Soft Engine" works and affects the way skin shines and appears, it is a very nice touch that I am very disappointed that whoever in charge of this port ( not sure if this was Team NINJA's choice or their boss Tecmo KOEI's choice, but either way they should be ashamed of this decision ) decided to leave this out.\n\nThe PC version is also left inferior with the fact that the only time the game runs at 60 FPS is during actual fighting, but everything else is locked to 30 FPS, making everything else not look as smooth which is a HUGEEE disappointment as well when most of our rigs are more than capable enough at getting the 60 FPS the consoles also get.\n\nThe lack of being able to purchase DLC the same way as the console counterparts is also very stupid, not everybody wants to purchase a whole entire $50+ pack of DLC, most people would rather just get a few costumes or themes that they prefer or for characters they like, I have no problem with DLC as the content is all optional and it helps the developers get more funds and hopefully encourage further and much more improved games but at least be smart about the way you advertise your DLC.\n\nOn the plus sides, as a huge DOA fan this title is still worth it in my opinion just because this is the first official time Dead Or Alive finally comes to PC and the mods that have come out this almost whole month have been quite good and they will only get far better over time as resources become far more available and people start to become more eduated about them.\n\nTHE FINAL VERDICT : Do I reommend this game? That depends, for huge DOA fans and those interested in mods I highly recommend this game. People looking at this game who are probably not too educated about Dead Or Alive or are in general just people that somehow know about this game maybe from a friend or an internet article and got curious, I do not recommend this game for you, however since Dead Or Alive is such a niche title I am going to put "I recommend this game", just heed my warning for those of you who do not know about this game, if you are not interested in mods or just want to try the game out get it for Xbox One or PS4, you will have a better experience there.\n\nIt sucks because I really want this game to succeed and I would like to see more come to PC especially but I believe bad business practices must have some sort of consequence.","April 24, 2015","true","24.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Runs smoothly during gameplay however the intro/outros on the fights feel capped at 30 FPS. If you want Online, then you might have to wait, if you don't need Online, then that is fine for you. Achievements are being tested and may be live soon. It's an entertaining game, if you like Dead or Alive, don't have a console, or appreciate fighting games.

There are a couple of stages missing, but most of the content is there. You also have the option of modding the graphics somewhat, which makes it look better than the console versions imo.

I love this game, great fighting! Good control and a great selection of characters. This game has been very contraversial considering its console counterparts have more content, also took over 6 months for online play then when there was online play noone plays the game anymore. Its a conspiracy against PC owners. But as a single player game, it has tons of unlockables. I enjoy the game itself, graphics are decent, really cool effects, especially like how you kick someone off a cliff only to jump after them to continue the fight. Graphic options arent in the game itself which is annoying, but honestly its not very hard on a modest PC anyways. Its mindless fun for a casual PC gamer. Its a button mashers paradise, easy is super easy, just keep bashing away and unlocking things. Yes you could turn up the difficulty level, but as a casual gamer who loves to unlock everything. The particles, smoke and destructable environments are nothing short of amazing! Do not let the drama scare you from this game, go out and buy it if you love single player games in HD, or even UHD.

At least one crash seems to be very common in the story mode for people.  A quick game restart and 100's of matches later, no more crashes.\n\nControls:\nI have used a ps3 (with MotionInJoy & BetterDS3), ps4 (with InputMapper), and 360 controller all without issues.  I also used the keyboard on my laptop and that worked better than I expected.  Lack of key mapping is sad, but I had no issues with the default setup.\n\nPerformance:\nThe game has run fine, with 30fps (cap on menus) and 60fps (cap on fights)* on an i7-2600K, 16gb ram, 770 GTX 4gb, 1080p.\nMy 6+ year old laptop (2.13Ghz Core2Duo, 4gb ram, 9800m GS 512mb, 720p windowed) runs at a very unsteady 30-60 fps in fights.  I never expect that laptop to run games well anymore so that wasn't too bad.\n*The speed of the game is tied to the framerate, so if the game dips below 60fps in a fight, the animations will slow down.\n\nFighting:\nIts DOA, if you played one before, you will know what to expect.  If you haven't played one, the system is based on Strikes (punch/kick), Holds (counters), Throws (grabs).  One beats the other when they go against eachother at the right time and produce extra damage based on that timing.\n\nGraphics:\nThis version of the game is based on the Arcade game.  To me with the settings all on, it looks better than the ps3 version.  I have not played the ps4 version, but from the videos I have seen, I feel the PC version looks about as good.  The big difference is the Anti Aliasing which PC provides.\n\nCons:\nI bought DOA5 Ultimate on ps3 when it was released and it would have been nice to see at least the pre-order bonus outfits from that be included in this or a few more outfits be included for the newer characters.\nI can't list things as Cons that were clearly posted as being added in later (online mode) or were never said to be in the game to begin with (Soft Engine, PS4 Particles).

To be simple , you play a high res. ,full details version of DOA , much more better than the console "featured" version ( Next-Gen ? My ♥♥♥ ! )\n\nStability : Don't trust the system requirements : i play full details on my old laptop with gt 630m and core i5 ,and the game always stay at 60 fps. No crashes , no bugs , only some slow-motion on the circus stage , but i think it is because of my old config .\n\nGameplay : This game is more complex and technical than others fighting games , with tons of combos and parameters to master.\n\nFeatures : OK , some features are missing from console , but what it is ? two stages ? soft engine ? Stop arguing , you still have 35 stages (with variants) , 34 characters (same as on console) , a long story mode, tons of challenges and 400 costumes. And people are still crying for Two crappy stages...\n\nDLCs : the dlcs have the same price on consoles and are only cosmetics ( just costumes ) ,stop it considering it as an argument in favour of console.\n\nOnline : it will be released within three months. I'm also disapointed , but honestly , there must be reason about it ; maybe they want to connect online with the console players whixh is a good idea.\n\nConclusion : it is not a perfect port , but a honestly good port . The game runs perfectly , with better graphics and the missing features are laughable ( you still have boob physics , even without the Soft Engine)\nI'm sad that most of the negative reviews have been made by haters who didn't even try the game before writing their reviews.

The fighting system is far better tuned than any previous DOA and it's a far more "tourney-capable" title as a result.\nSupports 4K resolution!\n\nThe bad:\nPS3 textures/effects. No option to scale the general fidelity up or down aside form shadow map resolution.\nResolutions are all hardwired, so you cannot custom-set the game's resolution. 4K is nice, but being able to set my own resolution would be better.\nThat wouldn't be bad, but it's $40. So PS4 pricing for PS3 detail levels.\nNo online 'til June 31st? Kind of a downer.\nZERO real Steam integration. No cloud saves, no achievements.

The DLC is purely cosmetic, so far, so it is not necessary to purchase for the gaming experience. The game runs smoothly and the characters are all gorgeous (backgrounds not so much).\n\nDOA 5 is easily the best fighting game on any platform, with a huge array of moves, 34 characters and multi-level, destructible stages. It has loads to unlock, great training modes to teach the commands and combos for each character. It has arcade mode, time attack, survival, team mode (7 on 7) as well as the story mode.\nThe story is ridiculous, but who cares? It's fun to play through.\n\nI am hoping the soft engine gets added before the new DLC is added, with clothes that can tear - the port to PC has certainly left out a few features that should have been added and there's no excuse to not add them. If these are added with free DLC, then the game will be perfect.\n\nAs for the current DLC, I recommend not buying it because developers cannot come to believe it is ok to charge this amount for costumes - if the DLC was £3-£5 per pack, loads of people would buy it and they'd probably make a lot more. I believe the £40 and £50 price tags will simply encourage piracy.","April 3, 2015","true","19.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I have an i5 3570 and an HD 7870 tahiti LE and it has no problems at the highest settings (1080P) and I am reading that it runs great on lesser platforms to no surprise. The down side is its missing online play at this time, missing 2 stages, some people gripe about the soft skin missing, STEREO only sound ( that really hurts), no rumble and the poor public relations Tecmo has had with the PC community. It did crash once in story mode but I didnt care too much since its bad anyway. There are also button mapping issues people are having. I compared it to the free trial version on the PS3 and there is no comparison at all. This is not a PS3 port, its the arcade machine port. I am a fan of the series and happy it arrived on the PC.

However, the game looks beautiful and runs great on my machine.\nThe character models are very well rendered and animated, and the hair system looks good with collision detections and very minor noticible clipping through the shoulders, I'd say hardly at all. The beads of sweat on the body and dripping down their faces after a match is a very nice touch and looks great.\nCharacters animate how you'd expect them to: Women are lithe and agile, and the muscle-bound men feel like they have a pressence even though they are all animated at the same speed.\nOk so no multiplayer for three months. You have PLENTY to do in the meantime. The story is pretty good so far at the point I'm in, and there are tutorials that you can master and get bonuses as well as a series of combo challenges.\nThe controls are great, haven't played it on a keyboard since I've been using an XBox 360 gamepad. My only complaint is that the analog stick for movement has a high latency in this game and really requires you to jam it all the way forward or back just to move, so I suggest using the D-pad.\nSpeaking of controls, they are very easy and intuitive to pick up even if you've never played a single DOA title in your life. All characters (and it's a pretty big roster) share countless moves with each other which means you don't have to lean every single move of a character. And each character has individual moves unique to them for you to master.\nAs I said about the story, it's not bad. Each chapter is filled with a few single round fights relating to that character and each chapter is a new character. I don't know if the game gets progressively harder the further you progress, or if that is just me playing characters I haven't trained with.\nThere are music tracks to unlock (and can be set to a certain theme for individual characters and such) as well as costumes for characters.\nThere are several modes of fighting outside of the story mode. Time attack, Survival, Versus (tag or solo) and arcade (also tag or solo matches) with multiple difficulties ranging from the easiest to one that will test even the best players.\n\nA couple of things I want to note about the engine this game uses. And is practically manditory to mention in the DOA games. The breast jigglage has been toned down in this game versus previous games to a more realistic physics model.\nAlso, even if it is on the ps3 engine, like I said earlier, that game is just beautiful to see in motion.\n\nMy last comment in my review are about the stages. There is a good selection of stages, all unique and varying, and many of them are multi-tiered fighting rings with multiple environmental hazards ranging from electric fences to exploding cars and even a tiger jumping through a flaming ring to maul your opponent.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fighting games, as there are not enough top quality fighting games on the pc besides Street Fighter 4, Street Fighter x Tekken, and Mugen.\n\nSorry for the incoherance of this review, it's 4:30 am and I haven't slept yet. I hope  I was helpful to you all.","April 1, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I could spend all day telling you stuff about frame rates, learning curves, etc, but really I liked it because it was a pretty game. This iteration continues that, it has a lot of nostalgia factor, even though the story leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nMy biggest gripe is the DLC, there is ZERO reason it should cost as much as the game itself, that's craziness.

Fighters looks good and the costumes range from cute to completely strange.  Stages are beautiful and varied.  The new fighters are interesting to play and compliment the current roster.\n\nCONS: I wish you could adjust the PC settings in the game instead of in a launcher.  Better PC optimization could have helped as well.  It feels like sometimes the game can chug right before the match starts.  This game doesn't have steam cloud saving yet so you have to unlock the costumes per computer which is annoying.  Also, the story is really lacking and kind of boring at times.

I have been wanting it for a long time. But, have heard over and over and over again how horrible the PC port was...it's not that bad really...\n\nI've had matches and only one of them has been like unplayable. We're playing online, expect the worst my friends ;) So yeah, as to how horrible this port is as to it's netcode, no, it's not so especially bad. I've yet to play any fighting game with flawless netcode :P\n\nThe only things that some times irritate me is that there are a serious lack of options and the game is in a permanent windowed state, you can change your resolution and go full screen, but you have to do it outside of the game. Look up a tutorial.\n\nI usually play my games windowed anyways though, because I'm chatting or have a media player open, so it doesn't bother me much. But some times you would like your game full screen...not being able to hit two buttons or just go to settings and select "full screen" is some what disappointing.\n\nThere are no advanced settings either which would help you optimaze performance and visualize. This is a very poor port in that way. It really seems like Tecmo just took the exact same console game and made it playable for PC. They didn't make it an actual PC game.\n\nIf you've never played a 3D fighter before or just want to play this but are afraid this game is a very very very bad port, don't worry about it, just buy it. It's not as bad as you've heard. It's MUCH easier than Tekken; and if you intend on playing T7 but have never played a 3D fighter, DOA is a much easier place to start than Tekken.","March 29","true","17.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I just want to clear the air and  say there has been some misinformation floating about. The biggest one is the lack of "soft engine" which makes people think this is a ps3/xbox 360 port and not a current gen. That is false, the graphics, besides effects, are equal to, or superior if you are playing above 1080p, then the current gen consoles. Soft engine makes the boobs bounce more, and gives off a soft, luminisent glow to the character's skin, THAT IS IT!\n\nI own a ps4 copy and the lack of soft engine is not a game breaker at all, I barely even noticed a difference and you can also install sweetfx to make your own version of soft engine if that is a big deal to you.\n\nPros:\n\n`DOA on PC! I thought I would never see the day, I am glad tecmo decided to port this over\n`game runs smooth, 60fps, its 30fps locked in cutscenes, I recommend potential buyers to check the steam forums, there is a thread about pc configurations to make sure you can run it well.\n` supports 4k resolution\n`mods\n\nCons:\n\n-no online features as of yet. I would blame this on Tecmo's inexperience of making good PC ports\n-RIDICULOUS dlc prices. Either lower it or break the costumes down to indivudual characters or bundles like you did for consoles.\n- Some resolutions are not supported natively. My 2048x1152 is not supported so I have to play on 1920x1080.\n- Can only configure graphic settings from a seperate launcher instead of ingame, as such if you wanted to downsample your game from 4k resolution to your native monitor resolution, you cannot do that "out of the box."","March 30, 2015","true","1.0"," 20 of 43 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","20","43","0","0"

It's a Japan thing I guess, but everyone likes it.\n\nCompared to the console versions, the PC version earned alot of negativ attention because of its missing features like the so called "Soft Engine" which makes "Breast Movements even more realistic".

I was ready for some quality extreme PC graphics with some PhysX thrown in there for the "jiggly" parts of the game. sadly what was delivered was something entierly different. At this very moment, updates might change this later hopefully, the graphics options are very limited and it pains me to see that the quality this game could be getting is not being delivered. Other than me not getting my PhysX and extreme graphics settings the game is very playable. I have not noticed any Lag or bad things about it compared to its PS4 and Xbox One version. they are almost identical, so identical I am willing to bet this just a Copy and Paste of the console versions.

However this game is a solid fighter featuring a large cast of characters each with their own unique fighting style.

I do see the issue with saves being linked to your community ID but really how many times do people change this for it to be an issue? I have also seen images where characters are floating or glitched out and so far have not experienced this. I have this game on the ps4 aswell and hardly see the visual differences between the two games, what I do notice are the faster load times on my laptop due to the game being installed on my ssd.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blitzen365/recommended/311730/","blitzen365","Blitzen365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blitzen365/","281 products in account","This is an "okay" port of DOA5 for the PC. Derived from the arcade version, which also runs on Windows, it can be seen as lacking visually compared to current generation consoles.\nGraphics are OK nonetheless, equivalent to those of the PlayStation 3 version, but looking a bit nicer when rendered in 1080p and higher resolutions.\nHowever I do believe that, as generally current gaming PCs are more powerful than even the current generation consoles, they can do better than that. This is quite a letdown, considering graphics are pretty much this franchise's main selling point.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game can run well on machines that do not meet the stated minimum requirements. I'm running it on an old Core 2 Quad Q9300 at stock clock (2.5 GHz) with a GeForce GTX 650 Ti, and it runs smoothly at constant 60 fps, in 1920x1080 resolution with FXAA and maximum shadow resolution.\nFor 1920x1080, 1 GB of VRAM minimum is a must, and looking at the CPU usage behavior (Core #0 is stuck at 100% at all times while playing, while other cores see a much lower usage, around 20-30%) I'd say it might run well on a 2.66 GHz Core 2 Duo.\nThat Core #0 stays stuck at 100% shows signs of an unoptimized program though. It does the same on a more powerful machine I run the game on (a Core i5 3570K at 4.6 GHz). The dropping of the "yawaraka engine" (which adds realism to graphics on current-gen consoles) might have something to do with this; just speculation on my part though.\n\nThe game currently lacks an online play mode, which is set to be released in a patch three months from the game's release date. While I'm not much of an online fighter, this may turn down many players. Those who like to play online might want to wait until then. Other play modes are identical to the PlayStation 3 version, except that the photo viewer is gone - the game uses Steam's built-in screenshot viewer for the photo viewer feature. I think that's good though.\n\nIn-game, it plays much like its PlayStation 3 counterpart. Effective use of holds is key, and the timing of commands may take a good while to master. Gameplay flows quite OK but I prefer the likes of Tekken and Soul Calibur when it comes to 3D fighter gameplay - a matter of personal preference, though. Playing with a PC keyboard could be somewhat iffy, however doable. I'd recommend using a XInput-compatible gamepad, those seem to work the best.\n\nTo wrap it up:\nPros: console gaming coming to the PC, good fighting action, and the franchise's traditional nice ladies ;-)\nCons: Apparently rushed port, downgraded graphics, sub-optimal performance, no online (for now)\n\nOverall: 6/10. This port is passable, but could be much better. I hope the devs get the hang of how the PC ecosystem works and bring us better quality ports in the future. Recommended - not for everyone though, but for those who like the franchise and/or want more games coming from console to PC. Those who have a current-gen console and the respective version of the game may want to stick to it though.","April 3, 2015","true","17.2"," 14 of 31 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","14","31","0","0"

That's not to say I'm incredibly awful at fighter's either.\nBut anyways...I love the game for what it is..I don't care about the stages or breast physix even though this game does have OMG mode.  To me it's just silly and unrealistic. The fact that users were complaining about no boob physix a few months back was kinda sad.\nI am a little disappointed in keoi tecmo for over charging on the DLC and not giving us all the pre order costumes.\nThen again...this might sound selfish, but I am a dedicated kasumi player and I like what she has. My original plan was to only use the princess costume, but I'm greatful I have a few other new favorites to choose from.\nI give this game a 9/10. Mainly the 9 because I've been playing doa since 2002 and still love it to this day and nice graphics on this installment.","April 4, 2015","true","152.9"," 52 of 109 people (48%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","48","52","109","4","0"

Also I don't know any other 3D AAA vs fighting game on PC.\n\n2/ It runs perfectly on my i5-2500K + n560 Ti, 8Gb RAM.\n\n3/ Lacking of 2 arenas and soft engine. To be fair, there's enough arenas for a solid game and boobs engine is useless as you can't focus on breast while fighting ; and boobs are already insanely defying all gravity even in "natural mode".\nSoft engine couldn't be put on PC as it requires motion sensitive pad (boobs are actually moving as you move the pad on PS4).\n\n4/ It is not really a game for pervs only as half of characters are male and the game is fair on that point : they get as oversexualised as females. And again, while playing, impossible to focus on cleavages. It can feed pervs only if they're already pervs.\n\nThe game is actually quite good itself : easy to get fun, (very) hard to master. The game will help you though to learn all moves and combos for each characters unlike Street Fighter which learn you either too basic combos or impossible to land ones.\n\nIt is a port so technically it can't be perfect but it is still better than Dark Souls'.\n\nIt supports natively my PS2 pad plugged with a low cost usb converter and I can rebind my pad... If you plan to play a VS fighting game with keyboard, even Streetfighter would be a pain to play.\n\nThe online isn't here yet, but it will come and unlike on PS4 ; it will be free... Maybe you want to wait for the online but it already supports the local MP and there's already much stuff to do : story mode - arcade mode - training mode, many costumes to unlock...\n\nSo, if you have a PS4, maybe you should take the game on it. If you don't and don't mind about "no achievements, no trading cards"; this game is cool.\n\nIt really runs fine for a port and the game itself is very good.","April 8, 2015","true","46.1"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","0"

It feels smoother and the 4K boost is very nice comparing it to my console versions. All the costumes are there as promised, however controller support needs some work... though it is playable, there are a few buttons that are not mapped properly.\n\nlocal co-op is a nice touch especially most PC games do not integrate this feature into their titles. Lack of online, achievements, and other main Steam features is disappointing considering the game was delayed for more than a month and most of the game was ported from the PS3 version.\n\nAs far as the lack of features go... If Team Ninja was outgoing, they would have made a proper PC version with beautiful textures and launched with the key features. It would have sold nicely and brought more attention to the Steam version. Hopefully in the near-future they will patch the game with current-gen textures and effects so it will get the attention that it deserves.\n\nIf you're like myself and enjoy a good fighting game for the enjoyment then I recommend this, however If the game is not fixed within a timely matter than I would wait for a price drop. I will also edit my review after proper alterations are made to the game.","March 30, 2015","true","7.2"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

While this is true, I feel that this game should be viewed in its own right and not compared to other versions of itself as it is the only version available on pc. As such I won't review the practices of the developer or continue comparing this game to versions on other consoles.\n\nDOA 5 is, at its core, a great fighting experience neutered of the life and soul  of what makes many fighting  games have staying power: an online mode. This is a shame as the game is very fun, and in my opinion is the best of the series. It has a large character roster, each with many costumes to unlock (I believe there are 500 or so costumes split between 30 or so fighters). It has a decent enough story mode that pushes you from fight to fight, a great tutorial and practice mode, and all of the other offline modes you have come to expect from fighting games these days.\n\nEach of these modes shows off the excellent fighting mechanics and engine of the game. There really is no other game that plays anything like DOA. For those unaware, the game gives you four main buttons:punch, kick, hold and grab. Rather than being a game about mashing in combos or learning how to throw magic like in many other fighters, DOA is about timing your strikes and reading your opponent. You won't make it past easy in the arcade without timing your combos with throws and counter-grabs. And this is not an easy  game to master. In fact, it is probably the most difficult fighter to get truly good at, because you aren't just using muscle memory to toss combos, you are actually trying to read your opponent and do a proper counter.\n\nUltimately I feel this is a great game, though  slightly incomplete. I give it a positive review because I like it, and would reccomend it to anybody who wants to play alone or locally with another player (which this does allow); However, some may not find this worth the money without an online mode, so I cannot reccomend for all. Even when the online is patched in, there is no telling if it will be laggy or if there will be anybody playing it still.\n\n","March 30, 2015","true","10.5"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

Though I LOVE the DoA franchise I'm very definitely a casual fighter. Also this is my 1st DoA 5 game. I played a little of it on my friends 360 but this is the first 5 I've owned. Previously I've owned DoA 3 and 4 as well as the Xtreme games.\n\nSo lets start with the game play. It's as fluid as it's ever been. I'm not quite a button masher but I definitely don't know all the fancy moves. But so far the characters behave exactly as I'd expect and VERY similar to DoA 4. All the characters feel very different and so far the rock paper scissors game play works perfect. If you're a casual fighting fan like me this is definitely "pick up and play" fun.\n\nFor modes DAMN are there a ton of options! I've completed the story and played a little versus and tag yet I feel like I've really only just scratched the surface of what this game offers. The cutscenes are very entertaining and filled with action and intrigue. The characters are colorful and sexy and the dialog is fun. Versus has more pre-fight options than I've ever seen in a game. I love choosing between the hundreds of costumes and the many hairstyles. There are plenty of difficulty levels so you'll be able to find the exact challenge you want. You can deselect characters and maps from being used when you select "random" so you're always playing something you want. Just TONS of different ways to play this game.\n\nGraphics are damned pretty as well. They're far from mind blowing but they are more than good enough. The art is fantastic and more than makes up for the lack of fancy visual effects. I'm running this game on max settings (1080p) with a GTX 760 and a AMD 8 core 4.0GHz CPU with 8 gigs of RAM and I easily get 60 FPS in matches with absolutely no dips at all. However the main menu and ALL cutscenes are capped at 30 FPS and the transition from fight to cutscene is jarring. Also I have experienced a crash.\n\nThere are LOTS of little things to unlock as you play the game such as titles and costumes. I'm not sure about the costume unlocking criteria but I've looked at some of the titles and they're very diverse and will make me play the game in different ways. To me this more than makes up for no Steam achievements and such as I'm unlocking stuff in game... the way it's supposed to be. That said there's really no reason they couldn't have costumes and titles as WELL as achievements like they do on consoles.\n\nSo far the game controls brilliantly with my 360 controller no setup or tweaking necessary. The menus and gameplay work all as expected but there is no rumble which is really disappointing.\n\nAnd now for the unfortunate part which has been said a million times by other reviewers. The developers/publishers are greedy mother ****ers. They call this game the best experience yet it's lacking WAY too many features the console versions have including quite inexplicably many graphics features. Then they charge more than the freaking game itself for DLC that has absolutely NO impact on gameplay. No extra characters or maps... just costumes and that will run you over $90. Insane. And to top it off they've been VERY secretive about the PC version giving us nearly no info until the last second and absolutely no gameplay footage. Simply put they have been blatantly disrespectful and have lied directly.\n\nMy review is going to ignore the terrible way they've treated customers and focus completely on the product they shipped. And that product is simply freaking amazing for a long time casual DoA fan who hadn't purchased DoA 5 until this release. HIGHLY recommended.","March 30, 2015","true","19.6"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

However, seeing that Last Round also came to PC and considering the fact that I did not purhcase Ultimate, I decided to give it a go and pre-order.\n\nSo far the game has run smoothly and I have encountered zero issues. The biggest problem right now with this game and all the negativity surrounding it is that it was not ported from either the Xbone or the PS4 versions and I still do not understand why Team Ninja made this decision. However, the game looks incredible and I've seen comparisons between the PS3/PS4 Xbox 360/Xbox One versions and the graphical change is barely noticeable, as well as the soft engine. Sure it'd be nice if TN would give us a port comparable to the current consoles as the PC is more than capable of running the game at the highest settings without issues. I hope that TN realizes this and gives us those missing features. I'm against practices like this as it was false adverstising on their part and shows how little effort may have been put into porting this game to PC. Online is not available and that really is a shame. For a game like this, not having online can really hurt. I don't really play online so the fact that it doesn't have it yet doesn't impact my enjoyment but I know that most people who play this game will want online multiplayer available asap.\n\nThat aside, the game is highly enjoyable, the fighters look incredible, the gameplay is smooth specially at 60fps/1080p and is my favorite fighting game because at its core, Dead or Alive 5 is a very solid fighter and for that alone I recommend it (and eyecandy of course, those girls are gorgeous). If you did not buy DOAU and your PC meets the minimim requirements, I say go for it and buy it, it is not a bad game by any means and the negative reviews seem to be more aimed at the fact of how the game was ported to PC. I for one will be enjoying the hell out of this game, the new fighters, the stages and the costumes (won't buy any DLC though, those prices are a joke). If you want a good fighting game on PC, go for it. Hopefully modders will enhance the game and TN will eventually patch it so we get what's missing.\n\nMy system specs:\n\n-Core i5 4670k @ 3.4GHz\n-8GB RAM\n-GeForce GTX 760 SC 2GB\n-Windows 7 Ultimate\n\nI'm playing on a 32" HDTV and the game runs at 1080p/60fps. Have not had any issues with the and it runs incredibly good, frame rate is constant and stays at 60fps during the fights, it drops to 30fps on the menus, cinematics and character victory/defeat poses. I'm fairly happy with the game and my fears of it being an unoptimized port have been proven wrong.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miskatonic/recommended/311730/","miskatonic","Joan Ferguson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miskatonic/","1163 products in account","I was very "on the fence" about this game when I first heard about the, supposedly, numerous problems that plague this "terrible" pc port. I'd pretty much decided to give it a swerve instead of effectively "doubling down" on it (I also have DOA 5 on xbox) but when I actually played it I changed my mind. I also changed my mind for a couple of other reasons that I shall detail below.\n\nFirst out I think it's important to address the "soft engine" debacle. This is basically an option for tv tanned virgins to enable which, apparently, makes the "boobies" (as they're childishly being referred to online in the myriad of "DOA5LR Y U ASSHURT ME?" videos on youtube) look more "real". Seriously ? Go outside. Failing that, maybe consider ending your own existence ?\n\nFor people to whine about the fact that the most miniscule, unimportant facet of the game isn't identical to the next gen console versions (soft engine isn't on the xbox 360/ps3 versions, either) is just laughable. Grow up, maybe ?\n\nIt does seem somewhat pathetic that team ninja even include this as a "bonus" (along with the "OMG" 'boobie' physics model that is unlockable) but, then, considering the extra curricular activities of the head of team ninja it is, perhaps, hardly surprising (master sex criminal/sexual supervillain). However, to rally against the community and threaten to make no more pc conversions if the mod scene produce nude patches for the characters (which they already have. Sigh....) is a little "rich" in my book. You can't have your sex offending cake AND eat it.\n\nAnyway, 'boobies' and 'nekkid' stuff aside, once I actually played this game I was more than happy to fork out the money for it for a fair few reasons. Here are some bullet points....\n\n- Anti Aliasing: The game looks amazing with this. Way sweeter than even the next gen versions, imo (which don't have it). Everything goes from jaggy looking, last gen style to smooth, silky, modern and cool. The AA is applied to everything, not just the characters, so the (somewhat jaded) backdrops also look much better with this applied\n\n- 4K !!! PS4 and XBOX ONE games actually run this in 1080p, which is a big change for these systems as usually everything is run in a resolution below this. Presumably they can cope as there's "not much going on". Anyway, PC can run it at 4K and it looks genuinely awesome. It also runs very well on this resolution, compared to a lot of other current games which seem to require titans/dual 980's to do so. Also, at 4K you don't need anti-aliasing as everything is so, so fine without it.\n\n- Sweet FX. Okay, this is an external modification BUT it makes the game look even more awesome. I've had a problem with team ninjas choice of colour for a long time and this basically gives you the chance to fix it. The main problem I have with their colourschemes is their apparent lack of ability to use BLACK. They just use charcoal/washed out dark grey and it always looks crappy. Ninja Gaiden could have looked so much sweeter if they'd blasted the contrast and upped the black significantly. He's meant to be a ninja, I believe they semi rely on the dark, no ? The same is true of DOA5LR, everything has a slightly "washed out" look to it. I'm really not sure why, aside from making the deduction that they like things like this. Perhaps their penchant for "the grey area" is a throwback to their boss citing it as his defence in his multiple and frequent deflections of the sexual harrassment suits that are levelled against him ? Who knows. Anyway, installing Sweet FX (a tiny and simple program) gives the game a look that really "pops" (there are multiple colourschemes/filters so you don't have to 'go radioactive' straight away, just find one you like)\n\n- FAST !! The game loads REALLY fast, even on a standard HD, though I have now moved it over to my SSD where it, pretty much, does everything instantly. Really good. I played DOA a lot in its various incarnations on the console and it's never been as rapid as this. #PCMASTERRACE\n\n- Mod scene. Aside from the obligatory "I'm a virgin/I am so dumb that I can't find pron on the internet" naked patches I forsee a great future for this game in terms of things being patched in by the modding community. There's already numerous Sweet FX presets to make the game look substantially better and it's been out less than a week. It seems that it is indeed, as far as the community suggest, fully mod-able so I look forward to seeing what people come up with in future. I hope it's not too much to expect perhaps some older stages decompiled from console versions and patched in.\n\nThat's pretty much the "pros" for now, so here are a few "cons" just to balance things out\n\n- Front end is a little ugly. Doesn't really matter, tbh, the game looks great but still, it looks very played out/last gen and could have looked a lot nicer.\n\n- No online (so far). I don't really care about this as I find fighters are usually pretty crappy online what with having to learn lag breaks and all that (there's even an option to simulate online lag in offline play included, though, lol, so you can get used to this "wonderful phenomenon"). However, I'm sure the lack of opportunity for getting absolutely hammered by Japanese players with the gaming equivalent of severe autism will upset some players. Cry me a river and drown yourselves. Just WAIT - it's apparently coming in 3 months or less. Maybe.\n\n- No keyboard control rebinding. Let's be honest, though, what kind of cretin wants to play a fighting game on a keyboard. Get a controller or an arcade stick. Failling that, tie yourself to the front of a large vehicle and have a friend drive it into a wall. Repeatedly.\n\n- DLC. I thought I was dreaming when I saw the price of it. WTF ? Seriously, folks ? the price is absolutely ridiculous for what amounts to, basically, aesthetic changes and nothing more. Still, if LOL and DOTA can get away with it..... I hope they bring some stage DLC and don't charge a ridiculous amount for it. That would be much more welcome than this soft-porn masturbatory material which is clearly pumped out (pun not intended) for those driven myopic by acts of furious DOA based onanism...\n\n- Streaming. So far I've been unable to get the game to stream onto my other computer, which is odd as the "less legit" version I tested before buying the steam version streamed fine from steam as a non-steam game added to my list. This is nonsense and there seems to be no reason for this to happen. It also locks up/freezes my host computer so I need to shut down and restart steam each time to play it again otherwise it doesn't accept inputs. A small issue to some but I do like to stream to my laptop so this is bugging for me.\n\nRight, so, in conclusion, there is nothing much against recommending this game as far as I can say, the only major gripe I have is with the streaming as mentioned above. Ignore the haters and complainers online and enjoy what is, in my opinion, the finest fighting game ever made (which has the potential to get soooo much better thanks to community interaction)\n\nI presume any problems WILL get ironed out by patches and will update this review if they are/are not in a month or so. One would hope all the problems people are currently facing will be ironed out soon but I don't seem to be encountering them... Also, this is available for around 1/3 of the price steam are charging on numerous steam key sites just google doa5 pc steam key.... buy from there and save yourself some money !","April 5, 2015","true","3.1"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

My only main annoyance is the two missing stages, but that's negligable. Is it worth the money? Perhaps if you catch it on a good sale I'd say buy it. However If, like me when it came to choosing what flashy gaming device you wanted to desperately get, and went for PC, and you need a solid fighting game with a not too small albeit not to big roster of characters, then go nuts. The gameplay, that thing that makes a game (as opposed to graphics and jiggle physics which seems to have upset a number of people) is solid, the combos are hard enough to pull off so you feel a sense of achievement when you hurl someone off a cliff, or through a window, or into a gas tank, yet not too easy enough that you can simply pick up and be a master, sure the story and voice acting is a little hokey at times (from what I have played so far) but then when can you take a game about girls with big kahunas beating each other senseless seriously?\n\nDespite it's minor annoyances, and tecmo's complete disregard for PC gamers, Dead or Alive 5 is at its core an engaging and immersive beat 'em up, wrapped in layers of disappointing excess.\n\n(I personally, am glad I brought this game.)

This game literally has 67 pieces of cosmetic DLC, except it's impossible to know what you're actually buying because instead of splitting them into 67 purchases like they did on console, they bundled most of them into packs of $50 or more. Unless you spend a lot of time researching what each one is. It's very clear that Koei Tecmo has no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ they're doing, which is very interesting considering this is NOT their first PC release. This is totally legitimate torrent material, this $500 of DLC.\n\nThe game itself was a ♥♥♥♥ing mess forever and I'm not sure the online functionality has yet been implemented. Achievements took them months and again I'm in the beta so I don't even know what's live.\n\nThe game itself is dandy, excluding how they gimped the pc version to not use features even the PS3 version had. It's just a shame Team Ninja's first game on PC was such a ♥♥♥♥up, because I had high hopes to be playing Ninja Gaiden at ultra graphics one day if this was successful. One thing I will say is, I am very much not a DOA follower, but I'm curious about a weird similarity to the end of DOA4 in this game.","October 16, 2015","true","16.5"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

And yes it is a pretty good game! Can't understand all this negative criticism. And its all about the soft engine, the two stages and the (at the moment) missing online mode, and not about the game itself. This is my first DOA game, and I was also disappointed that the soft engine/stages are missing, but the game is really good though. And I paid 34 euro for the game which is much cheaper than the PS4 version. It makes a lot of fun and the graphic and the gameplay is just nice :)\nResult: It is a good game, give it a try ;)","April 2, 2015","true","31.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Framedrops, texture pop-ins, broken sound, and crappy looking textures. Is this seriously worth a port to PC in its crap condition? I was playing at a very unsteady 35 fps. Then all of a sudden the game decided to do a massive drop in frames while fighting thus making the game crash and me being unable to finish the level. Really? And not to mention the ONLINE COMPONENT WE SAW IN THE PS3 VERSION IS COMPLETELY SCRATHED OUT!! This game might as well be in alpha because of how crappy the performance is. Hopefully someone will read this and head my warning. Dont buy it. Its not worth even 10$ right now. Character models look worse compared to ps3 and that is saying something.

"Last Round" contains several DLC costumes that have been released since 5 (eg. Cheerleader, Kitty, Naughty Girls). Massive bundles of even more DLC costumes are available, and ninja costumes are expected to be released as well.Yet the developers have announced that some features are missing and yet to be released with the base game: ONLINE multiplayer support.\n\nTo add on to the list of "what this game could have" (compare the equivalent Last Round release on PS4 and XB1) are: soft engine, two maps, and full controller support. If you're using an x-box controller with triggers, you may need a workaround to bind those as buttons. Furthermore, the game will only detect 1 type of control input, determined on launch with priority for controllers. If you want keyboard, you'll have to do without controller (and vice versa).\n\nIf you've always been a Team Ninja fan and you love DOA, you'll buy this game anyway.\nIf you're a fan of the 3D fighting genre and have been dying to get one on PC for a long time, I can't promise satisfaction.\nFor the rest, you'll wish you'd have gotten more out of what you paid for.

This pc port is not the ps4 version, and this does not include a majority of costumes/dlc, 2 extra stages, LR Physics, particle effects, destructable clothing. In simple terms. Incomplete port thats just the ps3/arcade version.\nAs a fighting game, its solid, fast, and intense with a large selection of unique characters with their own styles and gameplay mechanics. So if this does not bother you that you are not getting the full experience, and you dont ever plan on getting a ps4/xone, then you will still enjoy this game.\n\n2. Buy it on ps4 or xone. Dont bother with the pc port since its inferior in every way, both graphically and in features. As someone who bought dead or alive 5 on ps3, dead or alive 5 ultimate/ last round on ps3 and dead or alive 5 last round on ps4, and have been a long time fan of DOA, you will feel cheated out of the pc port.

Most of the negative reviews on here are being drama queens. I'll try to give as unbiased a review as possible, both for people who are new, and for the ones that already have the game.\n\nPros+ System requirements are lower than what you'd expect\n+ Stable port, which means it runs very smoothly during gameplay\n+ Nice visuals, superior to all console versions in many (but not all) ways\n+ Diverse fighting styles\n+ DIverse characters\n+ Has a story mode which is above average for fighting game standards\n+ Three VF Characters available\n+ First full 3D fighting game on PC\n+ Fighting mechanics are quite deep\n+ Save replays\n+ Training mode can display frame data and other details\n+ Tutorial can help new players\n+ Interactive stages\n+ Has support for Xbox 360 controllers (Haven't tested others)\n\nCons- Can't map keyboard buttons\n- Although visually superior, the game is missing the Soft Engine and particle engine of the PS4/XB1 version. These engines would allow for ripped cloths, better 'boob physics' and more particle effects. Has no influence on gameplay though.\n- Misses two stages from the PS4/XB1 version\n- Online is missing for now. This was announced a long while before the game was released. It will be patched in within three months.\n- Limited character customization in terms of cloths etc (mods remedy this obviously)\n- Additional costumes are overpriced, being almost twice the price of the game itself\n- Changing your Steam name makes you lose your saves\n- No achievements\n- No steam cloud\n- No controller rumble\n\nVerdictIf you like fighting games, and don't have an XB1 or PS4, this is a must buy. The cons are there, but they are not game breaking. Most of them fall under the 'nice to have' category, rather than being mandatory. And the online, which is a must to have, will be patched in soon enough. The 10% discount will be removed after online is patched in, so I'd buy it now if you can.\n\nThe system requirements seem a bit steep, but it's not that bad. Your CPU is quite important because the game is quite CPU bound, so don't expect to run it if you have an old Core2Duo. Graphically, older GPUs should do fine. I can run the game at 1080p/60fps with my HD 6850 with SSAA2x and 2048x2048 shadows.

This is the first entrance Dead or Alive has had on PC I believe and I think it definitely has its problems such as extremely high priced DLC which I dare not purchase as well as no online but it has some fun single player content such as combo challenges, survival, time attack, arcade and a story mode. If that's not enough to satisfy you it also has an amazing cast of characters, female focused which can be a negative depending on the person and some strong male characters as well. The story isn't the best however, which is to be expected since gaming isn't heavily dependent on the story and more on the mechanics which this game accels at. Rock, paper, scissors is how this game works and it's not a Tekken clone as well. It feels lighter and faster and with the counter system long strings can be broken which helps balance the game. Anyways that was my opinion. I feel like it's a good purchase as to why I used my hard earned cash on it.

Unfortunately instead of everyone being proud that we finally recieved this game they complain about the features it doesn't have and call it a bad port. I am usually a big complainer at these things. But this game has nothing wrong with it. With my GPU it runs 60 fps and the visuals are beautiful. I always wanted this game to come forth to PC because I played on the og xbox and loved the characters and fighting style.\n\nIf you want to call this a bad port or say its badly optimized then please I suggest you play Assassin's Creed Unity and see what a bad port really is,. People are complaining about that it doesn't have the PS4  graphics or what have you. Why are you all so hasty we are on PC this can be easily fixed with a patch. Look at the game warframe how it has evolved and looks more stunning everytime we play. Let's thank the company for finally giving us this great port fighter, and then lets ask and petition for upgraded graphics and keyboard or whatever else configuration you demand.\n\nI simply love this game. You earn the costumes unlike Capcom which you have to buy DLC.  I don't know why everyone is attacking Tecmo. ,My only complaint is in regards to them threatening pc gamers to never port if they make a nasty mod and to respect the characters. I'm all about this but how can you ask for this when in this game you ask for that respect and yet have enhanced breast motion, and you also have a Dead or Alive volleyball game where the females are being sensualized.Very hypocritical. Modding is free advertising and also helping your game stay alive and fresh so more people can hear about it, and maybe give your team an idea.\n\nBut again PC gamers I ask you why do you feel so entitled? Meaning we do need to check our own group, because we can't just go doing what we want.  If someone asked us nicely ahead of time then we need to consider the creators vision. Dead or alive isn't a sex game it';s a fighter, and although its a lil adult its not to much that you can't play with your kids. It's basically beach type or that girl at work that dresses lustfully yet doesn't want anyone to think she is something else.lol Anyways support this game, and lets get good attention from the devvs to give us the enhanced graphics, options, and let us mod. I am just proud to finally have this game in my collection and that it looks so wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nCorrection on my review just saw the dlc prices 50 to 60.00 dollars wow. I hate these dlc practices.\nThis is an old outdated game. The skins don't change anything about the gameplay. This left me baffled.\n\nStory Mode update: It was awesome. The cinematics felt so alive, and the story was glued nicely. Nothing complex but understanble and entertaining. Unlike Tekken or Street Fighet where you are like so what's the real ending. I was really satisfied with it. The other thing I love is I can rewatch them in the movies. Ah convinience. Love this game.\n\n\nOne thing that sucks big time is no online as of yet. That is terrible especially for pc where it's very competitive on that seen.","April 4, 2015","true","6.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Maybe the game had glitches on the release day but its 3/31/2015 and I haven't found any glitches or problems with the game. Granted there really aren't any graphics options to set from low-high other than shadows and AA so it may play poorly if your comp needs an upgrade.  It plays butter smooth on my value/budget gaming rig and looks fantastic!  I have not experianced any of the problems other gamers have mentioned in their reviews.\n\nI am perfectly fine with them releasing the game 3 months before they can get multiplayer working.  I'm just glad we finally have a dead or alive game released on the PC that works great!  I hope more console exclusive developers decide to release to the PC, even if they only have the know how to port their game over, as long as it runs good I'm glad I can enjoy the game from my PC.  Local coop and vs the CPU works great.  I love the team mode where you have 6 some characters on your team.  The game is much more enjoyable if you set the health to high since its easy to get the opponent stuck in a streak that will take half their health when playing at normal health.  I can't wait for the developers to release online multiplayer!\n\nThe devs need to add more resolution options, but playing at 1080p still beats the hell out of playing on a console and scaling 720p to 1080p and what not.\n\nMy only complaint is the costume sets are outrageously priced, but I expect they will drop the price significantly as new packs come out and for holiday sales, so whatever. The game is still worth it.

If you can't get past that fact, go play this on a console. But if you've been waiting for a DOA PC port, you will be pleased.\n\nDownsides are, aside from less than PS4 graphics, they are currently only trying out beta for online multiplayer, and the steam achievements are all locked for now.\n\nBut the up side? Steam sales. And, if you got a friend and 2 controllers like me, you got yourself a great fighting game and many, many hours of fun ahead.","June 28, 2015","true","11.9"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Really though, even with a lot of flaws this game is really fun. It has a combat system even more complex then Street Fighter, but anyone and I mean anyone can pick up this game and have no problems. The Pros just make it unbelievably satisfying to watch. It's also a 3 button fighter. Plus this game has waifus that are kawaii as ♥♥♥♥. P.S. What I said about the framerates is probably the biggest exaggeration in history.","June 16, 2015","true","7.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

This is the first entrance Dead or Alive has had on PC I believe and I think it definitely has its problems such as extremely high priced DLC which I dare not purchase as well as no online but it has some fun single player content such as combo challenges, survival, time attack, arcade and a story mode. If that's not enough to satisfy you it also has an amazing cast of characters, female focused which can be a negative depending on the person and some strong male characters as well. The story isn't the best however, which is to be expected since gaming isn't heavily dependent on the story and more on the mechanics which this game accels at. Rock, paper, scissors is how this game works and it's not a Tekken clone as well. It feels lighter and faster and with the counter system long strings can be broken which helps balance the game. Anyways that was my opinion. I feel like it's a good purchase as to why I used my hard earned cash on it. I hope this provided some insight to you fellow gamers.","June 19, 2015","true","24.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"
