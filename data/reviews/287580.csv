It's the best thing out before the release of Sid Meier's: Beyond Earth.\n\nAnyone who is wondering what this game is like, I'll give you a brief idea on what it is like by saying that it feels like Civilization V with a few major differences, such as:\n\n1. Random tech trees for each faction - you also discover new technologies after every era you pass through, to give a sense of wonder of the future\n\n2. Unit stacks - infinite number of units per tile; like Civilization IV's stacks of death. The game has actually balanced it so that attacking with stacks is less beneficial; bombardments hurt all units within a stack, flanking (putting units next to each other in separate tiles) gives an attack/defensive bonus.\n\n3. Customisable units - yes, you have a unit workshop and can fit different weapons/bonuses/abilities on them. There are a lot of different chassis to research (e.g. infantry, fast-attack vehicle, tank, watercraft, and more).\n\n4. Planet wildlife - at the beginning of the game, they are not hostile. However, the wildlife can get more and more aggressive if factions fight against them, or produce a lot of pollution. They may then become the equivalant of barbarians, or even worse (if aggressive enough, they can launch a full-scale invasion on humans, threatening everyone. It could prove to be a good tactic, for militaristic players, to annoy the local wildlife so that peaceful players are threatened with annihilation). There are multiple types of wildlife, ranging from practically harmless little xenomorph drones to gigantic aquatic monstrosities.\n\n5. City management - it works something like this; morale (happiness) is local, rather than national. Local morale has an affect on local growth, and local growth depends on whether or not you have enough food stockpiled (food pool is national). Growth is also affected by habitable space; if you don't have enough space, migration to other cities (ones which have more habitable space) will occur. Production requires minerals (also stockpiled nationally). If you run out of minerals, production will be hindered but not stopped completely. Science is gathered normally (1 scientist = +1 science). There are buildings, natural resources and tile improvements which produce percentage increases and/or a small increase in that stat. You can also move your citizen's roles (there are four roles; farmer (food resource collector), miner (mineral resource collector), worker (city producer) and scientist (science producer)) around manually, and they will automatically go to the highest yielding tile. There are other factors as well (such as wars, pollution etc), but that's just the gist of it.\n\n6. Alien invasion - around turn 200 (normal pace), an alien force (size depends on how difficult you set difficulty level/alien aggression level) invades the planet and the world has to rally together to fight them off. It's a nice twist and a breath of fresh air, especially if the local wildlife is almost extinct by that time or if you have been playing a peaceful game up until that time.\n\nIn addition, the game's presentation is very nice (introduction video, graphics, artwork, quote voice overs), soundtrack is great, UI is intuitive and smooth, optimisation is smooth as well; never lags or crashes (runs a lot better than Civilization V). The game is, amazingly, roughly 500MB, so it's a very fast download.\n\nWhat can I say which is bad about the game? Well, currently, the game has more focus on combat than Civilization. The game still needs, in my opinion, to add more content which aligns the player to a more non-combat style of gameplay (e.g. something similar to culture with wonders). There are multiple victory conditions other than conquest, such as economic and research victories, but it'd be nice to have more. There is also no indication of how far ahead you are when compared with your opponents, until the last few turns before your, or your opponent's, imminent victory, warning the player.\n\nThe good news is that the developers have pledged to add more content to Pandora: First Contact, maybe in the form of expansions, if it proves to be successful. So far I think the game has been successful, hence the Steam release (the game was released months before Steam).\n\nEDIT (7th August 2014): Just as I said before, they have continued updating the game to make it better and they have recently announced the first expansion pack, "Pandora: Eclipse of Nashira", to the game which adds espionage, better diplomacy, better aquatic gameplay (sea tile improvements etc), new factions and more.\n\nFor people hoping this to be the next Alpha Centauri, I wouldn't get your hopes too high. The game is good, and it is very similar to AC in some respects, but it's not exactly the same (e.g. no mind worms). Judge it for what it is. I played a lot of AC back in the day, and I thoroughly enjoy this game for what it is.\n\nIf you're still not convinced, or somewhat unsure whether or not to pay for the full price of Â£22 or $36, just wait for the eventual sale. I'd definitely call you mad for not getting it then.","May 31, 2014","true","37.0"," 271 of 289 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","271","289","0","6"

Well, I love games like this when they don't have massive problems. Pandora: First Contact is marred by two things as far as I'm concerned, though both of them are kinda the same thing - the enemy AI. I say enemy AI because that's what it is. Unless you jump through a mass of hoops and play in an incredibly specific way and don't let population get higher or lower than that little gap between X and Y and don't let your cash reserves do the same, or your armed forces power level, or the amount of land you have, or the improvements, or the... you get the idea, right? Long story short, it's next to impossible to keep the AI controlling the other factions happy, and when it isn't happy it becomes schitzophrenic. One turn it hates you but wants an alliance, the next turn it loves you but is denouncing you and cancelling all your treaties. It must have been incredibly hard to code an AI worse than the one in Civ 5, but they did it.\n\nThe second problem with the AI is just how utterly it cheats. I'm honestly not sure that they didn't tag the difficulty levels backwards. To test just how bad it is I started a game on the lowest, easiest difficulty level and a couple hundred turns in I'd colonised and developed the continent I was on and the the enemy factions in their two or three tiny little cities were still totally, utterly eclipsing me in reasearch to the point where they were fielding units two or three tech levels above what I had available. This is with the entire research output of about ten massive cities crammed with scientists and it was being completely outmatched by two or three crappy little cities with maybe one or two tiles upgraded around them. I literally had more scientists than any two factions had population and they were still outresearching me!\n\nIf these are ever fixed, this will be a nice little game. Right now though, it's just too frustrating to play.\n\n\nEdit: Okay, a tiny bit late adding this but not too long ago a big patch was released that was the dev's basically going 'yeah, we made the AI a cheating pack of superpowered madmen/women and we got tired of the complaints so here's us fixing it'. I haven't gotten around to trying it yet, but it does claim to solve a fair few of the complaints I have.","September 24, 2015","false","18.9"," 179 of 213 people (84%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","84","179","213","14","3"

However, that promise does not compensate for Pandora's failings.\n\nPros:\n1.  The game world is beautiful and interesting to look at.\n2.  There is a randomized tech tree that jumbles up the techs.  This allows replayability as no two games will have the same tech trees.\n\nCons:\n1.  Because the tech tree is randomized, the randomness could seriously gimp a game as there are a lot of inferior techs in Pandora.  Sometimes the player will have a lot of great techs on the way up the tree until the tech they are trying to attain.  However, sometimes that same tech will have completely inferior precursors.  It's all luck... which can screw with gameplay.\n2.  Native life:  This ruins the game.  First, even though a player may have alien life aggression set to very rarely, built the Xenobiology project (-25% alien aggression), did not attack one of the aliens at all, and are the Gaian faction (even more alien aggression reduction), random event of increased alien aggression overrides it all and they will attack.  It's completely ludicrous and needs to be removed from the game.\n3.  The AI is oversimplistic.  Essentially, military power = godhood.  That's the only thing they look at.  If the player has more power than the AI, then they're friendly.  If the player has less, then they become more demanding.  This functions mainly with the military and faith-based faction which are far mor warmongering.  However, it's still within the rest of the factions' coding and if the player loses a lot of military power from, lets say the ludicrous alien swarm random event, then even the most peaceful factions (Gaian) will start demanding or declaring war.  It's bad game design.\n4.  The spying in this game is completely broken.  First, there's no inherent city defense against spy units.  So, a player has to actively keep military units in either chokepoints or totally around a city to prevent spies from even touching the city.  Second, they are extremely overpowered in what they can do.  Steal or destroy a majority if not all of a faction's credits and research, cause massive unrest, destroy buildings and production, and even set off nukes.  The only contributing factor is the percentage chance the spy will succeed in the specific sabotage which is dictated by their veterancy.  It's completely broken.\n5.  From what I've read, everything I listed above will not be fixed by the devs as the devs have already moved on to other projects.  So sad as if the problems would be fixed, then the game would be a lot better.\n\nIt's a mess and I would avoid it in it's current form.","January 17, 2015","false","11.7"," 205 of 253 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","205","253","0","2"

It is not the first game to recieve this nickname, nor will it be the last. At its simplest, Pandora is a 4x strategy game that very closely resembles the Civilization franchise. What it truly is, however, is a spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri (the true 'Civ in space'). This game looks and feels like Alpha Centauri down from its visuals to its alien threats to having to deal with hazardous space fungus.\n\nAnd so, what we have here is an alternative to Civ: Beyond Earth. Think of Pandora as a baseline which C:BE must surpass. Because if the TRUE successor to Alpha Centauri cannot defeat the spiritual successor, a lot of people will be disappointed. And whereas it is not without its flaws (limited number of factions, a single visual style for all factions), Pandora: First Contact is a solid, enjoyable game. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for something to play whilst waiting for the release of Beyond Earth. And if Beyond Earth turns out to be a flop, Pandora is there to take its place.\n\nI heartily recommend.","October 11, 2014","true","7.6"," 115 of 134 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","115","134","0","0"

It is simply amazing.\n\nThe UI is so good it's nearly transparent. You always have access to the information you need. The busy-work is stripped out, and you're left with only the fun, meaningful decisions. Also, for the first time that I can remember, they do unit upgrades correctly. The starting units can be meaningful and useful in the end game, if you keep them upgraded with the latest tech.\n\nI've been playing turn-based strategy games a long time, and they always end up playing the same way. I was just looking for a graphics update out of this game, but it actually changed the formula for me enough that I had to change my playstyle to adapt to the game. That's brilliant - it feels new and fresh rather than just another rehash of the old, stale status quo.\n\nI think the addition of a truly dangerous PvE component really spices up the game. You've got to adapt to the situation. The randomized tech tree paths also help ensure that each game has its own unique story - it sounds weird, but it works.\n\nI highly recommend this game. It's a serious contender for my game-of-the-year pick.","June 2, 2014","true","60.3"," 79 of 86 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","79","86","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bungdup/recommended/287580/","Bungdup","Bungd-up","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bungdup/","171 products in account","Pandora tries to be a spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri, but it doesn't -quite- hit the mark. That isn't to say it's bad, in fact in some ways it can be quite charming. It's also a perfectly good alternative to Beyond Earth until that title drops in price to something a little more reasonable for what essentially amounts to expansion content.\n\nIf you've played Civ 5, you've more or less played Pandora. There are some striking differences - the non-linear tech tree, the ability to give units custom loadouts, alien hives, and the arrival of a "doomsday" army in mid-late game. It does these things well (Although BE's tech web sounds more impressive), and if you're trying to choose between Beyond Earth or Pandora, I would advise you to wait until Pandora goes on sale and then pick it up first. It isn't good enough to be worth the full price of $33.00 CAD, but it's well worth purchasing all the same.\n\nI found the AI to certainly be smarter and much more aggressive than its history-based counterpart from Firaxis, and the couple of games I've played felt like they moved at a much quicker pace. This is a good and a bad thing. For those players that enjoy almost constant conflict and a push to pretty much wipe the board early or be wiped, this is for you. For those players that prefer a slower Civ-style pace, you're going to be a little frustrated with the way the AI seems to blatantly rush through the game in -every- regard. My first match lasted only 50 turns before my AI neighbor wiped me out with tier 3 units while I was still clearing hives and building up my third city just trying to keep my income positive. In the 7.5 hours I've played, I've had 4 games - 3 lost and one win, all on small maps. I have one game that's been sitting unfinished for a couple months, but thats mostly due to other distractions.\n\nIn a show of fixing what should have never been "fixed" by Firaxis in the first place, Pandora does away with the silly one-unit-per-tile rule of the current Civ gen, including Beyond Earth. Yes, unit stacking is back. And it is fantastic. The "Training" feature that levels up your units was also a very welcome addition, and something that can keep your low-grade units competitive for a little while longer when resources are tight. Graphically, Pandora does pretty well. It's nothing outstanding, but it still looks quite good, and could pass as a product from a much larger studio if compared. Unit animations are nice and fluid, the sound quality is quite good, and the alien species have quite a nice amount of diversity. They're also quite difficult, and some of the larger species will continue to be a hassle for your units until about tier 3 weapons and tech.\n\nThe factions all feel reasonably distinct, but there was room for the developer to do a lot more too. The bonuses are nice, and give the factions a different feel when it comes to gameplay, but visually they're all homogenous. This is very disappointing, as even Civ 5 and the latter Beyond Earth allowed for numerous visual styles. This is something that could easily be remedied with a community mod, but the developer has yet to offer any workshop support and the modding community is terribly slow to grow. I'm no modder myself, but this usually indicates that the game is not all that friendly towards customization. There's also no map editor at the present, so if you were hoping to recreate the alien infested Earth from TV's Defiance, or KSP's Kerbin, you're unfortunately out of luck. Both of these things should require developer attention and soon, as they severely limit the game's appeal.\n\n6.5/10\n\nAll in all, Pandora does an okay job at presenting a decent sci-fi 4x reminiscent of SMAC, but just an okay job. It gets some things right, but it's also missing a lot of things that should be there already. The seeming lack of mod support and a community around it and no official map editor costs the game some serious points. If it had those two, I could probably toss it an 8 or 8.5, but as it stands it lacks two crucial features. That said, It's well worth picking up if it's on sale. But I wouldn't advise paying full price for what you get. Then again, it's still quite reasonable compared to the tag on Beyond Earth.\n\nA decent library addition for any fan of sci-fi or 4x games.","October 31, 2014","true","18.4"," 91 of 104 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","91","104","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toppestoflels/recommended/287580/","toppestoflels","Stiefel of Skavenblight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toppestoflels/","37 products in account","This is a solid game in its niche marked of 4x games, and more specifically, 4x games with space age human colonization. With its only direct competitor being the blatant AAA cash-in Civ: Beyond Earth, it is clear that this dev does not have much to compete against.\n\nLet's start with the bad, because everyone else starts with the good, and I'm a unique and interesting individual, as well as a special snowflake, so I go out of my way to be different in ways that try to be clever but miss the mark entirely.\n\nBad:\n-Lack of diversity and depth\nThis has been said since the beginning, and it still applies. Units lack variety, game mechanics are simplistic, factions are flaccid copies of their Alpha Centauri counterparts, and buildings have few functions. The game replaces real depth and variety with gimmicks like the Messari Invasion and the Nashira Eclipse (both paid-for DLC, of course), which get old and tired quickly.\n\nThere are only a few types of military unit: Infantry, Scout Vehicle, Tank, Mech, Helicopter, Boat, and Artillery. All factions have the exact same units, with the exception of the Messari, who have their own units, and the aliens, who also have their own units. Units all have a linear upgrade path of three tiers, corresponding with the three epochs of the tech tree. These units have Attack, Defense, Rank, Movement, and Health stats. These stats are boosted by a linear path of weapon and armor equipment, as well as gadgets, which are not linear and each grant unique abilities to the unit. The narrow scope and linear progression limit gameplay options and make unit customization a chore rather than the fun and interesting experience it should be. It also makes war less interesting. There is also little reason to have any meaningful combined arms force. There is no bonus or strategic incentive to have a variety of different types of units. This means, in theory, if you have an army of only scout vehicles against an army of helicopters, infantry, tanks, and artillery, you will win given you have the numbers, which is not at all realistic or interesting.\n\nThere are three kinds of combat: direct attack, artillery strike, and orbital strike. You will have no meaningful use of air force (since the only air unit in the game functions the same as the ground units), unit supply/logistics, morale, or other such thing that would add depth and realism to warfare.\n\nThere seems to be absolutely no effort on the part of the developers to add real depth to the game as they clearly favor gimmicks that sound cool and people will buy just because they sound cool.\n\n-Limited Diplomacy\nDiplomacy is very limited in this game. It very much comes down to agreeing not to attack each other, attacking each other, and open borders. Anything else is too hard to achieve or too useless to mention. People will complain that the AI puts too much emphasis on another faction's military power, but I have no problem with this, as it adds a competitive edge to the game as well as gives it some semblance of realism (let's be honest; when you have an ideology different from everyone else's and a â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor military, even the Gaians would want to gobble you up.) However, I do agree that it is too simplistic in this regard. You get no sense of geopolitics, where the different factions would take into account supply and demand for resources, the layout of the land, etc. What you get is a sense that you're surrounded by countries each led by a schoolyard bully, and the only way to win is by being the biggest bully in the playground.\n\n-Lack of mod tools/support\nThe devs champoined their use of the .xml format in making the game more customizable, but anyone who has attempted to mod this game will quickly discover that there is only so much you can do with them. You can change stats, you can add new techs, and other small things. But there is no way to change the UI, there is no way to make meshes/models for new units unless you have programming knowledge and patience for navigating the xml's mess of verticy coordinates, or other actually useful things if you're serious about modding. This game is not friendly to modding to any significant extent.\n\n-Blatant cash milking\nAs mentioned above, depth is replaced by gimmicks. These gimmicks come in the form of DLC that you pay for. They add nothing of substance to the game. The weak espionage system introduced in the latest expansion is also little more than a gimmick.\n\nPros:\n-Solid mechanics\nThe game suffers from few bugs, and there is no game-breaking mechanic to make this unplayable. It's not the most fun, but it's not completely unplayable.\n\n-Well designed atmosphere\nThe music, sound effects, art style, the factions, the alien life, all flow together fairly well. At first glance, it can actually be impressive. And even when that inevitable point in time comes when you get bored with it and it becomes old (because it does get old), it's at least not intolerable.\n\n-Comprehensive UI\nUnlike other games (*cough* Beyond Earth), this UI is informative and not invasive. Nothing is hidden from you. However, there is an issue with the game encyclopedia being limited to things that you've already discovered, which is frustrating for anyone who's done more than three playthroughs.\n\nConclusion:\nThis game's selling point is that it's the spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri. It very much uses the reputation of Alpha Centauri as a crutch to keep it standing, rather than standing on its own merit, which is actually quite mediocre. And of course, the devs don't plan on doing anything about this. Aside from the devs' love of gimmicky DLC, they also love to handle a bunch of projects at the same time, ensuring that none of them get the TLC they need to be worth any significant amount of time or effort. After all, why stick to a game to make improvements and developments when you can crank out half-baked cool ideas and make more sales?","February 25, 2015","false","238.7"," 129 of 168 people (77%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","77","129","168","25","0"

Sounds ok but not only is it ludicrously easy to control polution with no benefits to polluting, but sometimes you get little pop ups about the state of the world, but you can't track any global stats and so you can't tell which of the various nations is apparently chocking the skies. As for the results of polluting, save for the xenomorphs (who are also easy to defeat) I couldn't see a single issue in the world.\n\n*The Tech tree is DULL, very dull. nearly everything on the tree will provide you with either a building, a project (perminant global bonus on completion) or weapons tech to outfit your troops. But every building does the same thing, increase a single stat in your city. Every Project does the same but for all cities and save for the XP booster and the Regen items, all the unit equipment does is change their power stat. This is such a waste, I imagined that equiping illusion fields to a troop would give them stealth, or that using metabolic boosts would give an activated ability. But all the tech does is improve some numbers. In one of my campaigns I ended up making all my citizens into downloadable consciounesses apparently, did this affect gameplay? Not in the slightest.\n\n*Every Unit ends up the same, as all the equipment does is increase stats then you don't need to make hard choices with designing your units, here's all you'll need: Infantry with flames, tanks with rockets, tanks with lasers, flyers with rockets and maybe 1 mech to keep yourself from getting bored. Everytime you advance to the next era build that era's units, forget about the old one it can't put a scratch on the next tier. As units never get any activatible abilities from their equipment the only trade off is production time, but seeing as your cities are getting more advanced by the second you can easily keep up. I spent an entire campaign never researching ships or ATV's, why would I when I can orbitaly drop soldiers anywhere on the map (including empty enemy cities) and I have plains to do my scouting who have greater movement and resistances.\n\n*The lack of factions is also a problem for me, they are each focused on one extreme ideal, Military, Science, Theology (completly pointless as there is no religion system), Economy, Industry and Ecology. Their leaders have long dossiers on backstory and principles with set appearances, but unlike CIV V where you had a voice acted exchange with them, its all done in minimalistic pre-made text options. There are no unique factin units, items or equipment you just recieve a flat buff and a penelty to some aspect of your society, like the Ecologists who pollute less and gain a benefit from forest tiles but whoes military are 50% less effective (haven't used them for a reason). If we have to use pre-made factions then at least make them feel different from one another.\n\n*Diplomacy is bare bones. All it is is a few options to either Demand X, Give X, Propose X. Granted this was with the AI and you can have all sorts of backstabbing against your real world friends, but theres no ability to give someone units, to trade tech or resources or to even set up trade routes to make it feel like your nations are tied to one another. With the AI this realy does make it feel like your on your own against everything, they tend to change personality at the drop of a hat, break alliances that cost a boatload of cash to build and just generaly act like prescripted, poorly fleshed out programs like they are.\n\n*Victory conditions are terribly limited. you either win by controlling 75% of the population (military), researching 75% of all tech (science), or have more money than Space God (economic). thats it, no multistage tasks, no reprecutions for your misdeeds or rewards for being good, apparently everyone decided that because you got the ability to build farms just before they did (even if you were neck and neck in tech) that you won and are now master of Pandora.\n\n*The end is unsatisfying. At one point I was worried that I was going to be told that I was lord of a dead planet because of all the pollution caused by the industrialist faction (global pollution warnings having said things about thick smog etc) but at the victory screen it all meant nothing, there was no after story, no summery of events, nothing to actualy tell me the state of Pandora 'How badly was it damaged? what were the alien ruins about? do the Messara (evil alien invasion which died in 4 turns) return? No idea, you won have a medal and start again.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nPandora has some neat ideas, decent technical design and has no glairing failures. But it also has no great content to recomend it by, it falls flat on delivering a satisfying campaign and throughout the entirity of a game theres nothing to break the mould. The game plays the same way no matter who you are from begining to end with the ability to adapt units being just a drawn out way of giving global buffs to your soldiers. It lacks key features such as globally tracked stats, and it has no visual representation of changes to the world.\n\nIn short this game is not worth the money they want for it, if you need a new 4X and you want a Sci-FI one then get Galactic Civilisation II. Maybe grab this on offer because I did hav fun for the first hour or so of both my campaigns.","June 12, 2014","false","13.4"," 131 of 171 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","131","171","2","2"

At core this game is about super specializing your cities, micromanaging the population in your cities, and fighting the other factions. Unfortunately, the game doesn't really *tell* you how to manage your population or make the interface intuitive to focus around it.  At best, it offers 'lock buttons' on population types.  The combat is so-called multiple unit per tile, which removes some of the problems of Civ's one unit per tile.\n\nThe game falls down badly in diplomacy, where the AI seems to essentially perform a force count comparison to decide whether to attack.  Get behind in military force and you'll suddenly find yourself under attack.  Lose or even have a few units weakened in the skirmish and suddenly the other AI will all decide to join the fray and you might as well restart.  The tension, of course, is if you're building tons of military to avoid the AI pile-on, you aren't shotgunning ahead in science.\n\nIn combat, the AI seems to be decently competent, although late in the game they build tons of lower-tech units as opposed to higher tech ones.  They will brutally shell your cities with artillery and destroy modifier tiles.  The guy who rewrote the AI deserves a pat on the back for the challenge they offer in combat.\n\nAs for personality, Pandora doesn't have any wonders or memorable personalities like Civ's Montezuma and Ghandi, just the brutal optimization game of managing your population and keeping up your military.  The game's systems are too brittle to allow for casual play.  If you're not carefully optimizing everything from the beginning, then you're not going to have fun. This game was a missed opportunity. Civ needed some competition or at least someone doing something new and different.  This isn't it.","December 1, 2015","false","590.9"," 93 of 118 people (79%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","79","93","118","8","3"

Plus research is randomised per tier so each game is different, each nation is different, lots of good ideas here. Unfortunately this makes the science victory pretty much obselete due to the way the cherry picking of research works.\n\nOver all a nice ideas but they do negatively affect the gameplay....\n\nAI is utter â¥â¥â¥â¥ unfortunately... seriously, even during peace time they all build agents and send them against the richest nation or the most advanced nation. So who ever that is, gets every agent on the planet attacking them in wave after wave of agent infiltrations turn after turn.\n\nWar is the same, the most disliked side is attacked by everybody and if you sign the open borders treaty with everybody, they will all come to your land to fight each other. Even if your at peace with everybody. In all my games, my own land was always full of AI units fighting each other.\n\nIf you stay friendly with everybody you do not achieve an allied victory, you simply become the last one to die.\n\nThe alien invaders do not heal, but are twice as tough as your best units, so you have to wear them down, throwing wave after wave of troops against them in suicide missions. The alien mother ship works the same way only it has way too much health. I saw it defeat a stack of about 40 AI units in a single turn.\n\nDue to the way the research cherry picking works I saw an AI build a group of troopers that utterly smashed a group of 40 units of all types. The stack of 40 had a rich variety of troops, where as the AI only had colonial troops, so should have been slaughtered. But it wiped out the stack of 40.\n\nThe AI also seems to be able to build with out interference, whilst I end up in a constant battle with the native live from the very start of the game. Even when I made a point of clearing all native hives early on with flamers, the eclispe event ensures native live still attack anyway. Enemy seem to be able to destroy in provement instantly just by walking on them so its really not worth improving anything early on, it will all be destroyed anyway by the natives or the aliens.\n\nAnd that was all on very easy... the easiest difficulty the game has to offer.\n\nNice idea, but without meaningful diplomacy and AI decisions that do not involve all AIs ganging up on 1 player or AI , this game really is not worth much.","November 11, 2014","false","12.9"," 115 of 152 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","115","152","0","0"

I remember installing Civ 1 and gluing myself to the screen.  My parents would threaten me with "No civ!" from time to time and boy that worked.  I went on to play and enjoy every other version of the game, extensively, despite the changes that frustrated many.\n\nAlpha Centauri was my jam.  I probably had thousands of hours played, and I STILL have it installed and still play it; in my opinion it was the best in terms of immersion and strategy.  I would LOVE to see steam carry it, it would sell very well and I would have people to play with multiplayer again.\n\nANY WAY, this game is the modern sequel to Alpha Centauri in spirit; If you haven't played Alpha Centauri, I apologize for the reference, you should go look it up and get your hands on it.  It's brutal, immersive, and has endless playability, as is Pandora.  The game is not perfect, and is still being devved and updated (I trolled their forums a bit and their devs actively respond to questions and comments), but is still beautiful and brutal at the same time.\n\nStrategy wise, it is incredibly complicated however you can start out simply till you learn the ropes.  Customizable units means that you can get intel on what your oponents are using (with your nifty satellite recon operations, which are very useful), OR you can out tech everyone and have mega upgraded units that are good against everything and nearly immortal.  The latter is much more difficult and expensive.  It is easy to learn but hard to master, I still find myself changing my strategy mid game; discovering a new technology could change the tide of battle very easily.  Getting intel that an enemy fleet is about to hit your mainland when your army is off fighting on another continent?  No problem, you can research drop pods to recall your troops back to the mainland, and watch them drop from orbit to obliterate your foes on the beach.\n\nMid and late game can be VERY VERY HARD if you don't know what you are doing, which is something they are working to patch.  The eclipse isn't so bad, but the messari invasion can be very frustrating.  Here's the thing though, if you stick through it, it will make you a better 4x player.  Every game you lose you will learn something from... And YES, you will lose at first.  I recommend starting on very easy and low aliens until you get the hang of it.  Learn to skip techs that you know you do not need based on what your armies and infrastructure need.  It will take a few playthroughs to get the hang of this...  The random tech tree was odd at first, but I ended up liking it very much, it gives a very unique feel to every single game in terms of the strategic decisions you make.\n\nIt is a very immersive environment, beautifully however simply rendered.  Watching leviathans in the water waver, surfacing a bit and then going back down to a silhouette.  The combat could be done a bit better in terms of animation, but it is not too lacking, and I can't be quite that picky as simplicity is beauty.  This is a game I play on a 7 year old desktop, and it still looks good and lags just a tiny bit late game.  I love watching the world darken for the eclipse, and then re emerge to light afterwards.  Clouds of ash and infestation encircle the world and darken it a bit again for the messari invasion.  Late game is my favorite...  Dropping nukes on people, turtling then dropping massive surprise armies on people's continents, and if you are lucky enough to survive late enough and tech up well, you can SUMMON TACTICAL BLACK HOLES!!!  Alternatively, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ enemies off whom have out teched you will result in a very depressing loss via having your cities obliterated by enemy black holes.  Such is life in Pandora.\n\nCons:\n\nIt could use more music tracks and animations for leaders, and I'm sure they could afford like... Sir Patrick Stewart to do some voice overs for them.\n\nEspionage is OP and defending against it can be frustrating.  Surround your cities, and keep an eye on the events log to see when they are spotted.  Espionage is getting re worked in a patch at some point, so I have heard.\n\nUnit stack can be crippling.  Being a veteran to 4x will help with this, but you can go half a game successfully and then have a very tragic loss via an insurmountable wall of enemies.  In Pandora's defense, this is counterable by having good intel and making sure your armies are diverse enough.  Also, orbital bombardment via satellite and artillery units are good counters to this.\n\nThe AI is dumb in the water.  They will leave unit stacks in the water while moving troops, and this leaves them very vulnerable.  Much similar to Civ 5.\n\nDiplomacy could be more diverse and useful.\n\nThe AI likes to plant cities in your territory if you don't fill gaps between your cities.  This is VERY frustrating, but again hopefully getting patched.\n\nThe Messari invasion will kill you until you learn to prepare for it.  This, again, is getting patched (they need to either make it later or have a difficulty setting specifically for it).  Preparing for it mean covering your territory, and having a diverse (and not small) army and enough production to continually resupply yourself with troops.\n\nThis is way too long of a review I need to stop typing.  9/10!","January 10, 2015","true","319.2"," 68 of 81 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","68","81","2","0"

As a massive fan of Alpha Centauri I love that this is a spiritual successor, and eagerly dove into it. The game is pretty, and if you've played Civ or any other 4x game the controls are simple to follow without tutorial. What has killed the game for me, unfortunately, is the sheer aggressiveness of the AI. In all the 4x games I've played, I've never had other factions declare war on me so quickly, and for no apparent reason. Once war was declared, I seemed to have no diplomatic end available until after my cities were taken. The game seems to be designed for military win only - you're not given freedom to pursue science or other methods to win because you have to spend time/resources keeping up your military might to stave off war. That might make this the perfect game for some people - I'm just not one of them.","June 12, 2015","false","2.1"," 87 of 111 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","87","111","2","0"

Like AC, Pandora includes unit customization, terraforming, randomized tech trees and factions with distinct leaders and philosophies alongside a rich backstory and a detailed compendium. In addition to this, varied alien aggression and several alien-related events can easily disrupt the balance of power in a game, forcing players to react to new threats and even form tenuous alliances to overcome them. While the game only includes a few unit chassis (infantry, light vehicles, tanks, aircraft, mechs and dreadnoughts), each of these unit types can fill different roles with the wide range of weapons and specialized equipment available - it's not uncommon to find yourself with 3 different types of tanks, for instance. Lastly, the problem of "death stacks" isn't as large as it is in games like Civilization 4, as features such as orbital bombardment and artillery can damage entire unit stacks, punishing this strategy.\n\nThe only complaint I have at the time of writing this review is that the espionage system is too powerful in the hands of the player; it's possible, using two spies, to completely prevent an AI player from researching technologies and amassing wealth - while the AI is capable of using this same strategy (and they try), a human player will likely counteract this by positioning units around cities while an AI player won't.","October 26, 2014","true","7.6"," 50 of 60 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","50","60","0","0"

There are no diplomacy options to tell them to stop. So the only way to do it is to wall off your city with actual units - or just kill the AI.\n\nIt is unfortunate that I am giving this game a thumbs down just for this issue - but it's essentially game breaking. Don't use it - the AI will rob you blind, use it, you'll hopelessly cripple the AI and win easily.

It is not even close. The art assets are far inferior, the diplomatic dialogs display the wit of a high-school student, and the factions, although almost identical to those of Alpha Centauri, are not motivated by their ideology, rather they display no obvious motivation at all. Indeed, they are often completely erratic, and will go to war for no reason, offer peace after losing a few units and then declare war again a few turns later. Over and over, and regardless of faction. They will also erratically make and break treaties over and over, and will throw snide comments at you in an attempt to sway the other factions against you. Independently of faction as well as over and over and over. Lastly, the quotes associated with the research lack the cultural sophistication of those from Alpha Centauri, and are often uninteresting or even annoying. In other words, the interest in the technologies and in the interaction between factions has been tossed out, and replaced with snide and ham-handed commentary.\n\nPandora changes the game situation a bit. Rather than mind-worms and a nascent god consciousness, Pandora has varied and aggressive indigenous lifeforms that have a significant role in player development as they will harass your early colonies and inhibit expansion. There is also another alien race that will pop in with superior technology and try to terraform the place as well as wipe everyone out more directly.\n\nThere are some improvements to the interface, the management system doesn't lock you in a modal update sequence after each turn, and you actually get incident reports that you can click on to find out what happened. So, to the author's credit, some improvement has been made, although you will still get multiple dialogs overlaying combat so they have failed to fully understand the concept of 'communication' and the difference between noise and information. On top of that there is the stack of making or breaking treaty dialogs and the personal carping communications after each turn ... well, maybe after every *second* turn.\n\nNevertheless, Pandora is a playable and a technically competent game on the Alpha Centauri model. If you thought that Alpha Centauri took itself too seriously and needed to lighten up, Pandora might work for you.\n","August 2, 2015","true","12.7"," 45 of 58 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","45","58","2","1"

This game doesnt leave you hanging and having to guess what each faction leader did in thier life or how the faction came to be. Pandora first contact lore in a nutshell, it is an alternate version of history where humanity was more enticed with space travel and drained earth of its natural resources. After searching through nooks and crannies of space they found a planet that they called pandora and sent colony ships to it. they get there on December 2107 AD and that is pretty much where the game begins. Players are not the only threat as the natural aliens will try to kill you after you A. kill aliens B. do rapid expansion and pollute. C. they will turn agressive on their own terms.

Diplomacy is lacking though seeing as how you cant directly trade resources to people and such.  a diplomatic victory is pretty much non existent seeing as how military force/ war drives the game forward. Science is just a factor to keep your cities happy, lower pollution, and keep a higher production  and pump out more military units. Speaking of military units you have to have a large military on standby so it can flex its various muscles so it keeps people away.  AI needs some improvement but good thing that is coming so they are still making this game better and improving the experience. I will give away one faction to be careful around which is pretty much a religous extremist group who is always hated by other factions because it keeps declaring war on everything. That large military i mentioned you need it so that AI wont attack you. Im not the most religious person on this planet but isnt that faction's AI making referance to the mentality of convert or die?

The new, current version of the game is too advanced for me, which I regret admitting, but I have three AIs building nuclear facilities before I can even exit the first tech era. This game is not for the average Civ player. This game is for Pandoran survivors. How exciting can a 4x be? Well, you have the always grim threat of hostile aliens who can, and will, overrun your defenses and destroy your cities, along with massive sea beasts that will decimate entire fleets, all with giant aerial monstrosities that aid in your downfall. Want that power? Kill one and get the tech to turn aliens to your side, and use them to crush your foes along with your army. After establishing yourself, ancient beings who once presided return to their former home, hellbent on removing you and your rivals, creating a common enemy, forming a shaky peace between you, in which you will all burn and die, or triumph and sigh in relief only to have to turn your eyes to the horizon to confront your newly militarized neighbor.

But it's much more well made than I imagined it would be. The presentation is pretty good, the interface might not be the most beautiful one in the world but it is polished and functional, the tooltips are truly helpful, ingame information is easy to find, etc.\n\nThe semi-random tech tree is pretty big, with each research unlocking one specific item (a building, operation, project, unit part or such). Research seems to be quick overall, so are you constantly getting new stuff in small increments.\n\nI tend to dislike unit customization in 4x games; more often than not that's just busywork. I enjoy the way customization works here, though, some of the pieces you unlock give you interesting specialized units.\n\nBut more importantly, I think, is that ultimately what bores from other 4x games and make me go back to Civilization (or to Grand Strategy games) is the AI. There are a number of 4x games out there that are extremely polished and sleek, with interesting and well designed system... but ultimately I grow bored of them rather quickly because the AI doesn't seem to have any clue whatsoever about the game. It's like I'm playing alone in a sandbox, no matter the difficulty. As much as the AI of CivV is criticized, it at least tries to win and to interact with the player.\n\nFrom what I could gather, Pandora is now being patched by a person from the community, who has been focusing on AI improvements. Obviously I haven't played a lot of it yet, but from the matches I've played, I really enjoyed the AI behavior I saw (except perhaps by how quickly they changed their mind regarding diplomatic agreements) - it seemed to react really well to what was happening around it, I felt like I was having an actual impact in the game world instead of playing by myself while the AIs played by themselves.\n\nBottom line is: Pandora is giving me the "one more turn" vibe that non-Civilization 4Xs almost never manage to give me. The fact that there are decisions to be made almost every couple of turns (instead of long dull periods) and the fact that the AI seems to be really trying to compete with me are what collaborate to this, I think.","November 27, 2015","true","22.6"," 34 of 47 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","34","47","0","0"

Does some things well, somewhat lacking in the other and doesn't reach the same level of personality and depth as SMAC. Surprisingly fast paced for this type of game. Resource system is global, which works fine.\n\nThings I liked:\n+ Unit workshop. Build your own units like in SMAC, and with better interface. The chassis being the same things in 3 tiers is slightly boring, though.\n+ Randomized tech tree (per era). Of course it makes the techs connect to each other a bit nonsensically, but it prevents "the one true tech path" that plagues other games from forming.\n+ Allows unit stacking in such way that it still discourages the big "stack of death". OK, this is mainly here because of my opinion of Civ5's 1 unit per tile.\n+ Good interface.\n\nThings I didn't like:\n- Victory conditions are a bit meh. There is enough of them, though a few more wouldn't hurt, but the existing ones are just of the "reach 75% of X" variety.\n- Tech tree has some cool stuff, but also has too much of things like "factory, tier 2".\n- Diplomacy is kind of lacking.\n- Could use more content.\n\nDevs seem to be still working in the game, so it may improve.\n\n7/10","June 5, 2014","true","36.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

And it's not the flaw you think.  It seems like the problem would be that it's not "Alpha Centauri", like it's some kind of cheap rip-off of the classic.\n\nThe *real* problem is the opposite.  Pandora is filled with innovation and a completely distinct storyline... And then they shoe-horn features or decisions that *don't feel right* just to be a SMAC rip-off.\n\nHow do I mean?  The faction leaders have moderately interesting, tongue-in-cheek stories... until you read through and realize they are reskins of the SMAC faction leaders, with almost identical abilities.  They could've gone far, but instead painstakingly modeled them to remind you of the SMAC leaders.  It gets most painful when the abilities of one of the factions (Divine Ascension) don't really match the story... because she was so clearly meant to be a reskin of Sister Miriam.  Her story really doesn't justify the research penalty like Miriam's does...but she has it.  Why?  To be just like Miriam.\n\nThen they have a bad thing called "fungus" (like Civ:BE did with Miasma in a way).  It has some similarities (and many differences) from the fungus in SMAC... but it clearly meant to be the same thing.\n\nSomewhere in their dev shop, there's incredible innovative design talent, and in many ways it shines.  The pollution system works well, the resource-sharing with minerals for workers just *works*.  This would have been a 4/5 or better if they'd just left out the heavy-handed "we'll surely succeed if we rip off SMAC!"\n\nInstead, a "buy it on sale" 3 out of 5.","January 25","true","8.6"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","19","24","2","0"

It's competent in the sense that it functions, you can build stuff, units, expand cities, explore, blah blah blah. But it's not really interesting. The factions are pretty dull - aggressive factions are like the Civ Mongols, etc. Some of the rock-paper-scissors aspect of building units is neat as are the military operations. Tech trees, buildings, visuals are only ok.\n\nThe original alien planet gets old quickly and soon the life is destroyed. Nothing much interesting remains until a "twist" halfway through the game which makes an effort to shake things up. That's interesting the first couple of times you play but after that it's not that great.\n\nBeyond that there are no surprises. Every game plays out like the last one. It's lacking that all-elusive soul - there's nothing familiar with Pandora (Sci-fi 4x games tend to have this problem) and there's nothing particular cool either.

This game adds its unique tech and eco system combined with a refined global resource system from Warlock: MotA. It also adds Operations, which are mostly global skills like scans, upgrades or damage which either are on cooldown or must be produced in cities.\n\nHowever, you only get about 60 - 70% of the original AC and less if you add Alien Crossfire.

Note that I say simple, not easy.\n\nBasics: Its combat system highly resembles SMAC, that is, multiple-unit-per-tile, every-battle-is-lethal, and modulized unit design. Its economic system is quite inovative. And it's war-oriented, put it simply, just to grow, to produce, to research, no wonders or culture or religion or the like.\n\nCons:\n- Not enough varieties in unit design. Dispite strictly the same strength-to-cost ratio, Some designs are bound to be more useful than others.\n- There is best solution in economic system. Once figured out, there's little reason to deviate from it.\n- Not enough factions. Unable to fully fill large or larger map types.\n- (Almost) non-existent diplomacy. While there are pacts, attitudes and reactions, the most decisive factor for AI to declare war or not is military strength comparison. And most wars are dog-piles.\n- Not enough documentation. To be fair, this game does have a bunch of tips to explain basics to new player. It also does have quite a lot of fluffy texts. Just some details left unexplained. If it were another game, I won't list this as a con. Reason? See Pros section.\n- Over all, it's hard. Unfairly hard, maybe, to some people's taste.\n- feature wise, it's a pretty done game.

Some may be hawkier and some may be dovier, but if you (or another AI faction, for the matter) show them your weakness, they are not hesitated to pounce upon. And they do like dog-piles. So the real diplomacy in this game is not to paint yourself as target, and to gain your fair share during feasts on other AIs.\n- AI knows how to develop their economy. So you need to know it, too. That's why I complain about not enough documentation.\n- All those impressive AI are mostly done by a fan.\n\nIn all, if you want a challenging 4x game without resorting to giving AI tons of bonuses, this is the game for you.","March 1","true","62.7"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","15","19","2","0"

There is absolutely nothing in it describing gameplay in any way, just a reprinting of the in-game descriptions of the factions, some modding advice, and a warning about epilepsy and video games.\n\nMy first impressions were very negative.  They have upticked some, but I still can't give this game a thumbs up.  Once I restarted over and over I finally got down what the manual should have told me in the first place.\n\nStarting position is killer.  If you get dropped in the arctic/desert and have no mining special near you, you will have a nearly impossible time.  In the tropics or grasslands right next to a mountain with noxium in it: you're already 50% to victory.  This and other factors make save scumming and restarting all too convenient in this game.\n\nFor good or ill, the game has a difficult guns or butter start to it, as the only way to free up population for production especially is to develop the land around the settlement, requiring an expensive former unit, but things turn hostile so quickly that having a couple well cared for troops can be vital.  I have to rate that as a good thing.\n\nUnit xp and technology uptick so fast that the differences between the starting factions are pretty moot.  Small game=zerg.  Big game=zerg anyone on your continent/island, then go turtle a while as the feral native aliens will get nasty for a good while and the odd faction will invade for no particular reason.\n\nTo me, the most delightful part was the first time the expansion kicked in, and (spoiler alert) the wormhole aliens invaded.  The AI was at least somewhat responsive (I got truces declared with the factions that had survived that long), the aliens picked on everyone, not just the human player, and I fought back the baddies and the creeping crud they induce after a long, desperate, and satisfying effort.\n\nThe Steam achievements were realatively easy to achieve, and account for most of the reason I kept trying to play this game.  Unfortunately, again nothing tells you that most achievements are out of reach if you click on the advanced game setup (somehow they consider it cheating).\n\nThe graphics are generally pretty until you build a lot of mines, then everything looks like an ugly sand dune and it's hard to tell a mountain from a hill.  This IMHO should be changed for no other reason than to clarify unit movement options.\n\nAll in all I could recommend this game if I didn't have to spend so much time trying to figure out the basic world mechanics.

Aliens (Native Wildlife) in the game behaves similarly to Barbarians in Civ, their main purpose is to cause trouble and possibly wreck havoc in your new cities (with the exception that Aliens can actually raze entire cities in a turn). However, Barbarians will always attack you, but their not that strong, usually a good combination of 2-3 units can deal with most of those issues. But for Aliens, they won't attack you right from the start (that's why exploration is safe and actually a necessity); but when they do, they can be really troublesome; barbarians quite often invade in individuals, but aliens invade in large groups. Have a bad military and your city is prone to destruction. Other more powerful aliens (e.g. Galeths, Aspidochs) attack you much later in the game, prioritize the right things (e.g. research on weps) and you can deal with them (with the lost of a few units in some cases); otherwise be prepared to lose a few cities. Keep playing longer, then there's a third type of alien invasion that can even be more of an issue for unprepared factions (having little military), but I'll leave it for you to discover.\n\nNot prioritizing military was in fact one of the earliest mistakes I made that ultimately led to the doom of my faction sadly.\n\nIn terms of AI, it's overall well-designed; aliens can become a true hassle, AIs are in general very expansionistic and can be very militarily aggressive (that's why maintaining a positive military really helps you from AI threats). However, the diplomacy system within the game seems to be to basic and easy to manipulate. There's not much feeling or complexity to it. Believe it or not, factions are strangely very eager to go to war with other factions that they maintain a "reserved" or lower relationship with. Unless the opposing faction has an overwhelming superior military, the option "demand war declaration on third party" surprising works very well if you use it on the right parties (being "reserved" is sufficient). You can use to create large scale global conflicts of wars being factions and other factions while you just sit there and watch. Amazingly, even AIs who dislike you (being "reserved") will comply to those war demands if the third party is someone they are less than neutral with.\nIt would be very appreciated if the devs could do refining in order to improve it and add more complexity (something I am looking forward to).\n\nMaybe this is the aspect that makes the game quite militaristic and expansionistic after all.\n\nI would recommend this game, including it's DLC (Eclipse of Nashira) as it does give a nice additional flavor and element towards the planet's hostile nature, to those who are in space-themed 4X games, and especially those who are waiting for the release of Beyond Earth.\nAlthough, the game does come with a hefty price tag, however for those who are reading this on the day I post this, there's a current promotional sale (I believe it's 33%) due to the new release for the DLC. If you are looking to get it, now couldn't be a better time (however there's always hope for the steam summer sale).\nNevertheless, I did in fact paid the full price tag for the game, and I do not regret doing so.","September 26, 2014","true","28.2"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

My wars are also short. As in over. :) ) Graphics are pretty good. The game is more concentrated on city buildings and fighting. Oh, there are also some neat events within the game, mainly dealing with the local bugs and some space invaders. Overall, Pandora is really neat. I like it WAY better than Civ games.\n\nSci-Fi theme.

You'll usually only have time for one war with another faction before the alien invasion, and afterwards, you'll likely be very powerful (if you prepared properly).

No, it's better.\n\nI'm only a couple of hours into my first game, and I already know that this is a game I will spend a lot of time with.\n\nFirst off, yes, it looks alot like Civ: Beyond Earth. The Civ games are what got me into the 4X genre, though not until Civ 4, so I'm a little late to the party. I played Civ: Beyond Earth for a few hours during a free weekend. And, like most, I wasn't very impressed.\n\nThe first thing I noticed that sets this game apart from Civ games is the city management. I really like how I can arrange my population to focus on producing food, minerals, science, and production. If I need to produce some units quickly, I can ramp down science, minerals, or food temporarly and focus on production. Then ramp production down when needed. This makes it easy to balance your economy.\n\nI also like how you can upgrade units to have better weapons and defenses. Galactic Civilizations and some other 4X games allow this, but IMO upgrading your units can get way too complicated. Unit customization and upgrading in Pandora: First Contact isn't nearly as complicated. Though this may come as a con to some of the more hardcore 4X players.\n\nAnother difference is that the tech tree is randomized. I'm only on my first game, so I'm not sure how much this really effects things. If I hadn't known that the tech tree is randomized, I probably wouldn't have noticed.\n\nI'll update this review as I progress though my games.","June 14, 2015","true","6.3"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","20","32","0","0"

I wanted to land on a planet that felt alien, that had many and monstrous aliens.  I wanted to have hordes of infantry trying to hold back mountain-sized behemoths and leviathans swallowing my ships in one gulp.  This game has that feel.  The world is alien.  The gameplay is different enough that it will take a little bit of time to optimize your play compared to the more traditional Civ:BE.  If I had to choose between the two, right now I'd pick this one.  Immersion > polish...at least while aliens (and Aliens) have a significant presence.\n\nThere are some cons though; spies are cheap and can be pretty powerful (you can easilly scout an enemy's ENTIRE empire with one easy to do scout mission to one city anywhere in the world?).  There is no traditional manual:  yes, there's a book full of backstory, but there are no. rules. anywhere.  There isn't even a decent wiki and compared to other 4x games out there hard info is difficult to find, so optimizing your play will be difficult\n\nOverall, if you need the 4x on a distant planet game, I would tip my hat to this one.","January 6, 2015","true","17.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Quite a lot of the in game time steam recorded is actually just idling while the launcher was still open.\n\nPandora: First Contact is a turn based strategy game that tries to revive Sid Meier's Alpha Centaury, strapping it over a modern framework. At that it succeeds.. mostly. While the UI is certainly a lot more user-friendly than that Alpha Centaury had, you'd often like some more information about the progress of your empire.\n\nWhile the visuals are objectively a straight upgrade form it's spiritual predecessor it still doesn't look all that up to date with some blurry terrain meshes here and there or textures that could have used just a little more polishing. It runs perfectly fine though, at least for me, with a steady framerate even later in the game with much more stuff to process.\n\nIt features a quite expansive, randomized techtree that'll take quite a lot of time to get through to the end and while you can customize your units with different waepons, armor and devices the tiered, straight nature of the techtree leaves you with little suprises. New weapons are always just a better version of previous ones with just x more damage, nothing fancy.\n\nDiplomacy is rather bare bones as well with not all that much different options and not always your rivals react reasonable to your actions. You may nuke half of the planet and Mrs. Harmony-and-save-the-planet doesn't give a damn while Lady Religious-Fanatic even though you nuked the warmongering Imperium (which they were at war with as well). Said Imperium declared war on first contact on me by the way. I mean.. they are warmongers and don't like anyone but.. that's quite extreme. I played as the Solar Dynasty, sort of China in space - highly productive, fast growing but reckless which results in a lot more pollution. (save-the-planet liked me though...)\nIn general the different ideologies don't seem to matter all that much. You pick a faction with fixed strengths and weaknesses and stick with that; no policy system as Civ 5 had for example. Not even the social engineering Alpha Centaury had is present in any way.\n\nThey added espionage with their latest DLC along with water-tile improvements and some other interesting but ultimately not that relevant content. Espionage is... well, it works though it's not half as powerfull as you might think as agents are treated as regular units on the map. The way they work is best compared to the privateer unit in Civ 5. They show up as factionless units on the map and may attack empires you are not at war with without consequences though they lack the power to be effective at that. In fact they are easily killed even by the most basic infantry unit. IF they can get to a city though, they may be quite rewarding, based on the economical or scientific strength of your rivals. The only way to be able to get to a city for me so far had been to send a stack of 4 or more agents to a city and just hope they don't get stomped on on their way there - quite costly in production.\n\nAll that little flaws put aside that are inherent to games with a very limited budget it still is a solid game. Solid economy-system, solid combat, solid visuals, solid techtree, a good UI and enough things threatening your fledgeling empire to keep you constantly on edge at least up until late midgame.\nFor the low price you'll get 20-30 hours of fun and addictive "just one more turn" gameplay, if not more.\nIt may not have the depth of the original Alpha Centauri or the refined looks and gameplay of Civ 5 but, at least until Civilization: Beyond Earth is released, it serves as a rocksolid civ game with sci-fi based setting of which there aren't all that many around.\n\nFun, addictive, good looking if a little bare boned - Recommended.","October 9, 2014","true","84.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

This game has some beautiful terrain, and is very colourful compared to other games such as Sid Meier's Civilization series and etc., giving a nice vibrant alien look to the game.\nPros\nUnit Customization\nA more common version of Natural Wonders, such as Gardens of Eden & Natural Plantations\nGood AI. Unlike in other strategy games, the AI isn't easy to con, and knows exactly what it's doing & how it's going to do it.\nLarge Range of Tile Improvements & Ability to build upon special tiles to boost your gain.\nDifficult even if the AI has a disadvantage. Civilization players will easily be confused by the food, research, gpt, minerals & happiness systems.\nAllied victories.

A classic zerg from the Messari.\nGame Customization is weak.\nVery few leaders & some terrible abilities.\nDiplomacy could be better.\nAI is extremely rude (even though it says "Polite" or "Friendly") and usually found cities right on your border as a definitive "F**k You, sir."\nGame is fairly buggy, but not that bad.\n\nAll in all, the game is a fun experience on Multiplayer with friends, (on singleplayer not so much since the AI are absolute yobs), and the game has some interesting features, such as cities being named after famous people from all eras of this planet, such as Carl Sagan, Sun Tzu, Alexander von Humboldt, you get the jist, and imaginative techs, like Zortium Particles, Cloning Laboritories, Inter-Planetary Bombing Weapons, Blackhole Generators, etc.. Highly reccomended for those waiting for Beyond Earth & Civilization fanatics, or just strategy fanatics in general. The developers (Slitherine) have made some brilliant strategy games before, and this game may be a little under their usual standards, but it's still fun all the way.\n\n8/10 at a push.

Wesnoth is a quite fun turn-based strategy which is easy to learn but hard to master, just like Pandora. Though Wesnoth lacks economy, politics, resource management, terraforming, units customizing and research tree. If you like Wesnoth and want a more deep and complex game, Pandora is your best bet. I haven't played Alpha Centauri so I have nothing to compare Pandora with, and many people complain that Pandora is too simplistic compared to AC. I'm not a hardcore 4X player and I quickly lose interest if the game is too complex to learn. I need too much time to invest just to start getting fun.\n\nPandora has a great, thought-out UI, it's really one of its strongest points â you jump in and everything is just in place. You want information about your income and what you need to improve, and find it right there. You want an overview of your units or cities and there it is, allowing quick resource redistribution and task management. Every control is commented with a tooltip so you'll grasp it all in no time.\n\nVisuals are pretty, every unit is animated and looks great even in close range. Graphic is quite fast, I can play it even on Intel GMA (not HD), G620 on Linux. Not smooth, but playable indeed. Any GeForce of course would be much better.\n\nTech tree is randomized to prevent build orders, I don't know yet if it really makes any significant difference but it delivers some fresh experience and diversification among factions. It means you won't always have your favorite technology at the same turn and you'd have to deal with that. Unusual and interesting decision. You should also design units and can upgrade existing units to a more modern version (or downgrade and get money).\n\nAudio is good, voiceover is nice for a sci-fi game, some quotes are voiced, some not, but every technology has a detailed description and own quote (some real, some fictional). Always interesting to read, you don't just get +25% to weapon but also a bit of sci-fi story. OST could be larger, music is fine but there aren't many tracks.\n\nI haven't tried multiplayer yet, but it should be satisfactory as well. All game files (even models!) are in XML, so you can modify everything to your likes and even create new content like factions, units, terrain etc. I hope devs add the Steam Workshop support soon and if this game will take off, it may really become a big thing loved by many. We'll see.\n\nIf you're a fan of complex games like Civ5 or AC, have too much time to learn deep politics, many special events, cultures and controls, probably it's not your thing. Pandora is more oriented to fast combat and economics than diplomacy (which is like in RTS). I'm not a fan of diplomacy so it's perfectly fine for me. I also prefer sci-fi games over historical/medieval/fantasy and Pandora gives me everything I like.

Also, I've only just finished my first complete playthrough, so my exposure so far has been relatively limited.\n\nThat said, it's a VERY good clone.  The flow and strategic depth are definitely there, and the musical score is splendidly executed throughout.  I found myself thoroughly immersed in the old "one-more-turn" addiction that Sid perfected so long ago.\n\nTHAT said, it has a few glaring flaws, mainly in its backstory and the factions resulting from it.  The story is ham-fisted, rooted deeply in the politics of the ecological left, taking itself deadly serious without a hint of irony or humor.  The result is a series of events leading to colonization which make zero sense.  Despite lacking the resources to maintain a massive population, and despite warfare that should kill off millions if not billions (it goes full-WMD at one point), the narrative demands that human population levels actually increase so as to ensure an overcrowded planet.\n\nThe result is that every faction EXCEPT the ecologists are thoroughly stereotypical.  Playing as the militant, for example, I found that suggesting a trade pact involved selling "huggable doll-mines".  For children.  Parody?  Nope, it's played completely straight-faced.  And the game is LOADED with similar dialogue... except for the ecologists.  For example, when given a gift of credits due to our Generous diplomatic relationship, I was told "this is so you'll hopefully chop down fewer trees".  There are one or two mentions of ecoterrorism, but it's very much dialed back and representative of real-world incidents as opposed to something as over-the-top as "doll-mines".\n\nAside from this dissonant style of characterization, though, it's an excellent game, well-worth your shekels if you liked anything the Civilization series ever produced.  I just hope the Steam modding community develops custom factions soon.","July 15, 2014","true","25.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

So, I was very reluctant to buy another 4x game. But, my latest CIV kept running flakey when my forces got too large in the endgame, so I was jonesing for a 4x that I could play until the "bitter end".\n\nAfter reading some early reviews that stated the alien fauna would kill you before you could build a decent "civlization" (wink, wink), I put off buying Pandora. Well, I don't know if they patched those problems or the early reviewers just did not have the patience to deal carefully enough with the alien bogies. The current game is hours and hours and hours of playability!\n\nI never thought that I would find a 4x game that would outCiv CIV, but Pandora has stolen Sid's lunch.\n\nBesides being a wonderful multilayered strategy funfest, I LOVE the ARTWORK and game descriptor blurbs. The weapon forge/modify screen has some of the best/most novel art I have ever seen in any game. Great Art and very intelligent/funny story writing. Who knew a small independent developer could stand up to the long established companies? The next CIV release is going to have a mighty high bar to surpass in Pandora.

I am also reflecting on a couple of criticism I read about the game.\n\n- "This game is similar to Alpha Centauri (AC)". Partially true, but in the same time there are many new aspects as well. What I found painful and less than AC: lack of animations, movies and no spy games. I found more fun in the special operations.\n\n- "Upgrade is costly". Correct, if you upgrade a simple guy to the latest technical level. If you upgrade one within the same era, it is more reasonable. Similarly to the real world...if you change catapult to ballista you can make it...if you change catapult to cannon it is costly....catapult to ballistic missile? probably you cannot afford it.\n\n- Bugs. Yes, I found a couple. Drop Pod operation have dropped all of my active units (instead of the selected one) in one location. Upgrade unit is not always change the name of the unit, especially around the end of the game. I found a third problem but I cannot remember. However I cannot find any significant issue.\n\n- Gameplay. Combat system, upgrade options, storyboard, unit and city graphics are good. Diplomacy and trade including economy have to be improved. You have only two goods on the market....why we are not having more, including special things like drop pods and even more, research results or blueprints...?\n\n- City management. Similar to AC or any other Civs type of game. I found it easy-to-use, however a nice inside view of the city would be better.\n\n- Combat. Overall is not bad, but strange things can happen. How can you shot down a warplane with flamethrower...I would see :)\n\n- Aliens. Graphics and animation are OK, but they are simple. If you wait, develop yourself, you can rob the nests and wipe out all of them.\n\n- Great surprise about alien invasion. I can imagine more surprises like that in the later stage of the story.\n\nAll in all, I like this game. What to improve? Animation + movies and economy + trade.","July 11, 2014","true","40.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

By now you'd think that video game manufacturers (Specifically Electronic Arts) would know better.\n\nHere are the reasons why I say, no, this game should not be bought:\n\n1. There are too few nations in this game. Giving the game more nations would make it much better, since there is more competition for the world.\n\n2. Get rid of the damned growth! The game forces you to grow and colonize new areas, even there is nothing else to colonnize. When you colonize the world and have nothing elser to colonize, you still get kicked around by your own cities eventually. You lose minerals, food, science, and credits, losing your military and formers. Why must you lose formers when they are required for making your nation stand back up?\n\n3. Too few unit types. There are only 3 vehicles of each kind, walkers, tanks, boats, troops, and strike craft. This seems a little limited.\n\nHere are the reasons why I would recommend this game:\n\n1. The unit customization in the workshop offers a whole new way to play 4x games. You can customize your foot soldiers with missile launchers, machine guns, snipers, and more. This isn't limited to just foot soldiers though, strike craft, tanks, and boats all use this as well.\n\nBut that's probably it.\n\nDo NOT buy this game, it is a waste of time, space, and money.","November 26, 2015","false","13.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

I love the idea that i can design my own units. It's a 4x game that allows you to customize your stuff thats awesome. It's AI isn't horrible but doesn't stand out either.\n\nThe issues i have start with the development company itself. I mean they have a history of making lower quality game and then basically abandoning them. This game lacks so many common sense things, like your planes are normal units like your tanks but with a different animation. There is no ranged attacks no rebasing no recon or strike missions they're just normal units that can be attacked by anything. There is no ranged attacking grid that shows you what you can hit with any units. You can build an artillery unit but there isn't anything that shows an area of attack, you litrerally have to move the  unit to attack like you would any other unit.\n\nthe game just feels like one day somebody just woke up and said "screw it lets launch it", even thought it wasn't even done.\n\nNow before you think i'm all hate, i do like a few things about the game. I love the random tech tree, the design aspects of the units and the upgrading of the units.  but again the unit options just seem like they only spent half as much thought on it as they should have.\n\nBut even the replayability just wasn't there. I mean i played a game and went to play again and there was like no difference it was like i was playing the game i finished. Each "faction" is only different in the % differences they have nothing unique about them other then that. I mean one gets an increase in production while another in science. But when you play either of them it's still no real difference.\n\nSo many good ideas with very poor execution. this game should have been in development for another year and it would have done much better.","March 4, 2015","false","8.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

Much like when you are placed in a desert in the start, "playable but dont expect to win".\n\nYour oponent show up rather close to you or not at all, again making restarting the game quite high, and yes you have to go back to main menu, not like civ that gives the option to reload if begining conditions are not decent.\n\nIt is more a war game than anything else which is good except for the fact that the game boils down into 1. who has the better tech tree? who has the best starting area? and Who is not getting attacked? which ussually mean that the factions that have combat bonuses ussually dominate.\nyea the imperium has acheived a domination victory before any race reached tier 2 in the tech tree (mechanized era).\n\nUnlike civ where going on an early conquest gives you a bad rep with every other faction (warmonger) but it also causes a very unhappy populace. Not here, going nuts killing your neighboor is the most efective way to win.\n\n\nThis feels like a beta. too much randomness, too much warfare leaves all the other parts of the game irrelevant. if you are a hardcore civ/4x player, stay away.\n\n","June 4, 2014","false","9.8"," 29 of 56 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","29","56","0","0"

Combat is tricky (but you can stack units, unlike in Civ5) and rewarding. The tech tree is a bit more diverse than Civ5 offers.

Though that did not discourage me to not try to play. I contacted customer support and even made a very useless Steam (seperate) account (for the steam support program, of course). The support team is awesome, and answered me whitin minutes. Though they asked me for log files, I am a computer noob and didn't know how to find it. None a less, what I did to get it working was simply, just using the .exe file and creating a destop shortcut etc.\nJust like Civ V(which I've played for quite a while), it's one of those games where you always want to come back to. It's very additive in a good way, I spend at least 2-6 hours per session.\nI'll start of by saying the game is indeed pretty hard, even on Very Easy(AI suffers a slight advantage) I constantly get attacked by the Imperium(playable faction), or any other big war mongering faction, before the aliens attack me, at which the aliens are also on Very Easy(less tough, and travels less far). The farthest era I have made it to is the Transcdence era. At which I got destroyed by 2 factions attacking me at once, one with almost 4 groups of 30-50 power in total, other lesser groups with 10-20. I defintely toke a screenshot of this, at which you can see on my profile :P.\nI'll finish up by just talking about some other things I like as well as some suggestions. It's cool how each playthrough there are randomized tech trees, making it less repitive. I have encountered a bug where on the main menu, well there wasn't a menu...not a big thing, but only one I have noticed. The main things I would like to see is the Very Easy diffuctly, actually being very easy, not Medium(where the AI gets a slight advantage). Last thing I can think about wanting is more maps, there is only 2 or 3 I think currently, and no Workshop either to download maps as I am aware.

Yes conceptually it is similar to A.C. but is different enough to be worth it.  Took a bit to get the hang of game play as the automated picks for city growth and production played absolutely wrong for me.\n\nSo list of things to be improved in game play to make the game better:\n\n1. More control of how automated growth AI chooses for my cities.  I am constantly haveing to go through every city and reduce Food production in favor of minerals.  Very tedious eventually.  Similarly the AI picks grassland before forest, another bad choice.  I have huge food surplus but no production.  Either make it better or let me have other switches (mineral focus, food focus pollution reduction focus etc).\n\n2. Land improvements from Formers seem mostly waste of time.  I moved to playing (single player) with formers making forests almost everywhere (or fungus in late games) as they dont get destroyed, they give balanced food and minerals and reduce pollution.  Was the game designed to be eco friendly?  :)  Late in game when I have large numbers of troops (fast movers like planes) I can defend suburbs from destruction but early game I make no farms etc.  Sub note automated Formers are worthless.  So micro manage again to make them work right...\n\n3. Maybe a city production slot for upgrading/refitting troops instead of disbanding or cash instant upgrade.  So a city could take a number of turns doing no other production than refit of my tanks etc.\n\nEarly game largest map I found that 2 cities are best to hold against waves of alien drones.  Turtle tactics on the huge map to hold out until you can voyage out with enough troops to break the nearest hives.  Only been playing a week though and only on easier settings with huge maps.  Though if you hold onto your 2 cities until growth and tech are good the drones are very easy.  The Mesari coming back to the planet is interesting but again if you hold tight turtle wise to your 5 or 6 cities you can hunker down and hold out until you again have enough tech and troops.\n\nSo overall feelings:\n\n1. Too much micromanagement going on to optimize or play the game efficiently (as I like).  I can not let the city managed resources go the way they are programmed.  I am fighting against them and rebalancing them often.  Same with city land expansion picks.  As each city grows I have to go look immediatly to see if it picked pure food producing land yet again.\n\n2. The waves of "barbarians" are strong and reduce the chance of rush strategy attacks on huge maps which I love.  The drones and Mesari are the things rushing the humans instead of one human rushing to the win.  Makes play feel more frantic but not against the other humans which is cool.\n\n3. Not sure of real long term replay though.  Remember only a week playing so far though.\n\nAs a turn based strategy game I recommend.  Could it be better?  Yes but games today are improved after release which makes me hopeful for continued play.","June 22, 2014","true","151.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I must say the game is amazing, and I am very glad I did.\n\nAs of this post, Eclipse of Nashira has been released, before this expansion the game lacked a bit of depth. With the new expansion I think the game more then makes up for its short comings, and overall I am enjoying the game. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the civ series.

During my first hour of play I think I came across about a dozen "Wow, it's exactly like Alpha Centauri" moments. While it competently replicates most of SMAC's nuts and bolts, the game does fall short in terms of grabbing on to that classic's immersion factor. I found that whereas with SMAC, a lot of my enjoyment was connected to grand strategic role playing, Pandora was at its best when I played it more as a board game ignoring the cookie cutter nature of the AI opponents and just concentrating on the 4X dynamics. You can have lots of fun with it but I doubt it will stand the test of time ala SMAC. For 4X devotees especially of a SciFi persuasion, I'd say it's a good purchase at a $20 or less price point.","December 31, 2014","true","44.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Do it for yourself; do it for the children.\n\nWhy?  I've play Pandora quite a bit (150+ hours) and I think the game is fantastic.  Decent graphics, decent variety from game to game with a randomized, non-revealed tech tree that changes for each new game, and some interesting mechanics that make it differ from the 4x Gold Standard - Civ/Beyond Earth.  It's definitely 4x, but unlike what you're used to in Civ, there's basically one goal - kick everybody else's â¥â¥â¥.  The game does have concepts like  espionage, culture, diplomacy, research, and other misc. things that you'd expect to see in a 4x game, but unlike Civ, those features aren't geared towards using your wiley ways to strategize some sort of machiavellian victory - they're all geared towards boosting the size of your â¥â¥â¥-kicking boots.  This takes a bit to learn because the help files for the game are basically non-existent, and going into the game, you'll likely approach it with a "Civ" mentality - "Lemmee build some farms and macro up for a while, then maybe I can go scout and have a skirmish here or there, blah blah blah...".  If you try that in Pandora, you will promptly get your â¥â¥â¥ handed to you.\n\nThe game is a fighting-centric 4x game right out of the gate, and unlike Civ or BE, the aliens will give you a serious beat down for a good portion of the game - you can even take control of them and continue relying on them as attack units up through the late game...this is the result of having meaningful battle veterancy upgrades on your units that make each unit valuable and makes keeping your units alive for a long time a vital part of the gameplay.  This is noticeably different than Civ/BE where unit upgrades from battle veterancy don't really make or break the game - in Pandora, veteran units are the difference between winning and losing.  Things like city and resource maangement are somewhat more basic than what's found in Civ games, and the graphics don't match Beyond Earth, but tile upgrading is more or less similar to what you see in Beyond Earth (minus the orbital layer which doesn't exist in Pandora).\n\nI purchased the game with the DLC for $25 total on a Steam sale, and knowing what I do now, I'd be happy to buy it at full price.  It's decently replayable, it just had a major patch to address some balance changes that will make the AI better, and the developers seem to still be engaged in the game, so I'm crossing my fingers for a second major DLC similar to Nashira to be released sometime.","April 3, 2015","true","197.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

No, this is not Civ: Beyond Earth. To be honest; it doesn't really match up to anything Sid Meijer and his studio make. But this is a fun game!\n\nThe depth of play is kinda shallow. The Aliens too important (they are like the Civ barbarians on steroids; too overbearing). The map is kinda smallish. Even on the lowest difficulty setting every city is constantly struggling and in need of micromanagement. Especially that last part is a challenge.\n\nBut on the other side: The game is very moddable (documentation is lacking but the devs will answer your questions), the unit system is very very good (You can keep upgrading units whilst keeping their experience. You could end up with your first Infantry dude killing the last enemy at the end of the game). Development paths pretty straightforward.\n\nAll in all: It's kinda like a casual version of SMAC or CivInSpace. Where you take a week, maybe two, to play a civ game, you can do a Pandora in a night or two. I would definitely recommend this.","October 2, 2014","true","64.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

But it seems to me the AI is quite weak, for both the other Civs and the mobs.  Early on in the game you're extremely weak, and you'll probably be dead in the early stages in most games.  If you do make it past that point, you quickly become invincible.  The tedium for me began when I realized that as hard as the early game was, the later game often was as easy.  The AI civs are often dead well before the game gets very far.  Not all of them, but many.\n\nI got the game 50% off, and for that price I'd recommend it.  But for the full price?  No.  I'd wait for something more refined to come along.  Since I can't really recommend it based upon the assumption you'll always get it for half price like I did, I'm not going to recommend this game.\n\nWhat this really does for me is prove what a master Sid Meier is at what he does.","September 25, 2014","false","12.3"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

Yes I know, the studio want to make something different from Civ 5, but I don't think it is a good idea, I prefer to play a game which totally copied the setting of food resource setting from Civ 5, instead of having a nwe form or setting but useless.\nDid you ever see any game that have a random tehnology tree? Yes, this game have, I do not know whether it is a bug or just a setting, if it is a setting, I think the people who gave this idea to the studio should be arrested and charged by his guilty idea, this setting is stupid and makes people uncomfortable, a random technology tree? I think most people will never accept this idea.\nThe AI enemy is also make me crazy, even the easiest level AI, can easily have more population in its capital than the sum of all your cities' population. When you product a group of soldiers, you will find that AIhave already producted 3 more groups and their weapon are better than yours.\nSome details in this game are also very ragged, if you want to give your AI friend some money or ask them for some economical supply, you can not decide the number, there are only four choice: one forth of the money you have, half of it, three forths of it and total. Try to image that, when you want to make some economic agreements with other counties, and the AI country have this repeat:" Yes, I agree it, you just need to give me everything you have, and then I will agree this aggrement." Well, is there anyone will sign this agreement?\nI think I don't need to mention how bad the maps in this game are. different from Civlizations' studio which spread a scroll map in a rectangle map, this studio want to made a map of a real ball planet, which  you can go to any direction and finally you still have to back the original point, this studio spread a ball map in a damn square map! And no matter where is your birth place, it always in the center of the mape. Well, I think everyone have the experience in this game that you can see a complete continet or island divided into 4 parts and speard in four corners of the map, right?\nWhat this game bring to me that makes me feel angry is the stupid semifinished game system, I doubt  that is this game can comparing with Civ 1?\nBut finally, I still bought this game and gave it a positive. I don't think this game is worth to by, but it really have some good ideas, although most of the ideas I have already seen in other games.\nI think the best case is the militay and unit setting in this game. You can give your troops their own weapon, decide they are anti-armor or anti-infantry troops, also we can change their equipment in our cities. I have saw this self-decide system in "Fallen Enchantress", but this game seems have a better idea, and it really did it better.\nThe background setting is simple but interesting, it has 7 different countries, which have the same military unit but different advantages, one country have economical advantage, other one have military advantage, these seven countries are simple, and no doubt many people can easily find out how to play it. But it really interesting.\nUnlike Civ BE, this game have more interesting things in later time, I means in military and war, in other parts like economic or politics, no doubt that Civ BE is much better than this game.\nDifferent from civilization, which known as a well-developed game and have perfect game setting, this game looks like a semifinished product. I think I can put this game in a group with "Age of Wounder III" and "Fallen Enchantress", although other two games have totally different theme, these three games have  some similar things. They have many bugs and semifinished settings, they are not finished, they still have to make more improvement, but they have very good ideas that make them different from Civilization.\nFinally I gave this game a positive, and I bought this game. I wish to see its sequel, and I hope its sequel have more improvement and I then think I will buy it.","April 7, 2015","true","0.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I have played three games now, four if you count that the first game I restarted because it made me the wrong faction despite my settings, so for my review I will tell you about them. I started off how I always start, everything on the easiest setting.\n\nGame one: tiny world, 2 players. The game didn't last long, I didn't even get a second city before I won a economic victory. My economic value was in the 1400s his was in the 1200s. That small difference doesn't make sence to me, but oh well.\n\nGame two: tiny world, 2 players, all victories off. Started of okay then the AI player declared war, I was doing okay at first but for some reason they seemed to be able to build powerful units in like 1 turn, where it took me 2-3 turns to build one. So I died soon.\n\nGame three: small world, 3 players, me and an AI against an AI, all victories off. No wars, played all the way til no more techs to research. Spent most of the game struggling with lack of habitat and negative minerals. The plus growth buildings seem like suicide since a lack of habitat will cause rioting, and the fancy factories don't do anything without enough minerals. I never once saw an alien attack anyone.\n\nI guess if you like a short game that just involves fighting wars then this game is fine, if you are like me and want to feel like you are colonizing a new world, this is not the game for you.","June 12, 2015","false","7.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's now a very boring game. I just recently got this, was hoping it had improved, it hasn't. Actually I think it's gotten worse.\n\nAI diplomacy is too erratic to be useful. This is how it went for me: They offered Trade Agreement, then Research, then non-aggression, two turns later AI cancelled non-aggression, research, and trade, followed by denouncing me, another few turns I was praised, followed by non-aggression pact, etc, etc.\n\nThe game plays like this, you have global food and minerals, as long as those two are positive, your cities will grow and you can build units and buildings. If food goes into negatives, city population goes down. If minerals go into negatives, you can't build anything. Improving hexes around your cities only affects those two (global food & minerals). Individual cities don't gain any benefits by improved areas. The most beneficial improvement is forests. You can either build a farm (+1 food), mine (+1 mineral), or forest (+1 food, +1 mineral, -1 pollution). So why even build the other two?\n\nAlso there are aliens wandering about, attack them and they wipe you out. So you must wait until you're strong enough to take them on (which mean a lot of next turn clicking).\n\nThis game has too many bugs. for instance your sentried units will jsut wake up for no reason. The workshop where you customize your units is a mess. It too easy to alter your exiting unit to something else and not even realize it.\n\nYou can't even tell a former to build a road to somewhere, instead you have to move it there, then tell it to build the road, then move it agian to the next hex. Or you can just set it to auto and hope for the best, though to me it seems that it kept chaning the same improvements over and over. And the only thing roads do is allow faster movement, So instead of it costing one to move, it costs half. Also when buildinig improvements, they always take the same amount of time to build regardless on what type of terrain they are being built on.\n\nThere's really only one plus to this game, you can stack units.\n\nThis game is just an utter disappointment. By turn 300 I quit, being utterly bored to death, which was followed by an uninstall. I can't comment on the DLC, don't have it and never will. Nor will I ever purchase anything from this developer again.\n\nEven though I got it in a bundle for 8 bucks, it just isn't even worth that amount.","May 18","false","5.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I was disappointed by Civ: Beyond Earth and it's similarity to Civ 5 in almost every way. I was also getting bored by the Civ pattern and the gameplay template it sets out. Those two things, along with a recommednation from James Portnow, convinced me to buy this. How wrong I was.\n\nPandora has some severe issues. Expansion is constantly hounded by an unbalanced overpopulation mechanic, forcing you to curb growth until you unlock the techs to mitigate overpopulation. But without growth, you don't have enough people to reasrch or build anything in any reasonable amount of time. Deep stats are presented as simple figures that foten don't seemt o make sense against what's actually happening. I'm producing +34 food globally per turn but my people are starving? WHY?!\n\nAll the while my AI opponents (apparently set on the easiest setting) are expanding wildly with flourishing economies. They start wars for no reason, with no build up, and present advanced, powerful militaries while I'm struggling to feed my people. I felt like a leaf in a storm of â¥â¥â¥â¥. The worst part is the game was giving me no feedback as to why this was happening, no information for me to learn from.  While I'm still trying to unlock techs to boost my civilisation, I'm being hammered by rockets and lasers several stages ahead of me on the tech tree.\n\nI suppose the biggest issue is the AI. In Civ, you can predict and plan round what the AI is doing through experience and careful diplomacy. It means you're unlikely to be attacked without a good amount of time to prepare yourself for war. In Pandora, a recent friend will declatre total war for no reason, at random. If you focus on a strong economy, at any second you can be wiped out by a random act of aggression. Focus on a powerful miliatry and you could be sitting around for years, burning through credits, with no-one to fight. Oh, while your people starve and your civilisation fails to grow.\n\nI'd like to say Pandora is a tough game for those with the time but even on the easiest setting, it's a struggle. Constantly having to micromanage every tiny thing and work valiantly against a jumbled, unbalanced and often random set of systems is not my idea of fun. I don't think sitting here, after 150+ hours of tedious, depressing misery, will really feel like it was worth the effort.\n","February 26","false","5.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I have not spent enough time with the Return of the Messari version, but I don't really see much in the way of changes that would effect my opinion beyond the Messari faction itself (which invalidates my late-game-road-bump comment). I just wanted to post this here since I see some questions asked that maybe it will help address.\n\nThe game is ok. If they had differentiated the game from SMAC more, they probably would have been better off. I guess the comparisons would have happened no matter what, but going head-on against such a legendary game means that they set themselves up... maybe not for outright failure, but for leaving people thinking "why shouldn't I just play SMAC?"\n\nThe Good:\n- Population allocation to various jobs is innovative and well done.\n- Alien creatures are a real challenge at first.\n- Operations - global special abilities with a cooldown. Cool mechanic that brings global reach into play.\n- Semi-random and somewhat blind research tree keeps teching up somewhat fresh.\n- AI is competent and seems to be playing the same game.\n- Hexes are better than squares every day of the week.\n\nThe Bland:\n- Diplomacy is the usual pacts and such for a game like this. Additional trading (resource trading, etc.) is unlocked by techs. The economic and research pacts are pretty well thought out to give appropriate bonuses to each faction. Worst part of diplomacy is that the AI seems to spiral down one path or another (it keeps loving you or keeps hating you).\n- Late game aliens are just a speed bump. It would be better if the aliens ranked up as the game progressed to keep them challenging. [MESSARI should address this - tbd]\n- Unit customization is ok - but often comes down to "put the best available thing in each slot".\n\nThe Ugly:\n- World Generation options are simplistic to the point of being almost non-existant. Islands/Continents/Pangea plus choice of size. That's pretty much it. This drives replayability down immensely, and is my number one problem with the game.\n- Moddability is lacking. Sure you can do some basic stuff like add factions (though the game limits you to six in-game no matter what) or tweak some terrain modifiers, but again for a game like this to shine it needs good mods. And for good mods, you need more support for modding.\n- The factions are meh. Cut and paste SMAC factions lacking the personality of the original.\n- I felt like I stumbled into victory conditions. No clear way to see progress toward the different victory types.\n- The game still has no soul. It tries to pay homage to SMAC, and therefore puts itself in a position to be measured against SMAC, and comes up seriously lacking in that regard.\n\nUnfortunately, without more changes to increase replayability, I can't really recommend the game.","June 20, 2014","false","1.1"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","0"

There's a feature to design your own units, but in general there's really just a linear 'upgrade' path with most other options not working out well.\n\nAs a player of old time classics like Alpha Centauri, Master of Orion, and the original Civilization games, I was actually impressed to find a lot of neat features and customization capabilities that reminded me of the old days. The problem is that the way the game is designed, these features don't seem to mean much. There's pretty much only one way to go, and that's to be as warfare driven as possible.\n\nMaybe I just haven't quite -got- the hang of it otherwise, but diplomacy seems unrefined and war is utterly unavoidable no matter what kind of victory you're aiming for. I've not been able to survive a single game without investing heavily in warfare, often at the expense of everything else, due to the combat driven AI.\n\nThe one and only game I ever managed to create any sort of 'peace', it had pretty much become a Cold War of just building more and more combat units, just to prevent war. While there was literally no space left to expand otherwise. Maybe this is an artistic statement, in a sense. When all the land is taken, there's no other choice than to kill your brother for his land.\n\nAll in all, I would only recommend this game if you prefer your Civ-style games be more action-packed and are prone to combat oriented games. Otherwise, you might prefer to wait until Civilization: Beyond Earth for your Alpha Centauri spiritual successor.","June 27, 2014","false","12.5"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

"Ask on the forums" does NOT cut it. Experienced SMAC players will likely muddle through, but only with a lot of trial and error. Novices will be completely lost.\n\n2)The minimum requirements are not high enough. I exceed them and have all the graphic settings turned down (because, seriously, who needs fancy-pants animated graphics for a turn-based 4X game?) and the game can't even keep up with the mouse. The mosue focus keeps lagging behind the cursor, so the wrong things get clicked on. Annoying and tedious, which are not adjectives I like to apply to my leisure activities.\n\n3)The description does not mention that the game is more focused on the combat side of things than most entries in the genre. There is no culture, no religion, minimal diplomacy and between two types of aggressive aliens and the other factions, expect to be pounded constantly. This isn't a bad choice per se, as there are lots of people who like this play style, but it should be clearly stated in the marketing text.","June 29, 2014","false","25.9"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

Even on the easiest level if you are not prepared for the alien invasion then you are in trouble. The aliens become aggressive too early in my opinion even when playing with the threat level at its lowest.\n\nAfter about 3 restarts I tried a new tactic of early expansion. I rushed to get my second city as close as possible, after that everything started booming. I spammed out lots of troops and cleared my island of aliens just through sheer force. But this style of gameplay is not what I wanted. It seemed to me that the only way to thrive is to get a good starting location and rush straight towards your second city.\n\nThe game was not as good as I was hoping. It lacks balance, even with all the settings at their lowest if you do not prepare for the alien invasion you will be crushed. Pollution and overcrowding can quickly turn things sour. My biggest concern is that unless you play a specific way, you wont get far in the game. I can imagine it becoming very repetitive, very quickly.\n\nOverall: the game did not accomodate my playstyle and just lacked something for me.","June 22, 2014","false","7.3"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

The graphics and music are amazing, animations smooth, the UI is easy to use to the point of being intuitive. I'd describe some of its mechanics--economy, trade, resources, and diplomacy--as being "Civ V Light". Unit combat is somewhere between Civ IV and Endless Space: each unit has a default power level, but units also have types, and as in ES you can customize your units to be better vs. one type of unit than another. The research tree is somewhat randomized, but sufficiently complex that most games will be won somewhere in the 2nd of three "Eras", depending on your victory conditions.\n\nOf particular interest: the aliens of Pandora. Imagine you've turned the barbarians way up in Civ--in terms of their population, not necessarily their aggression, another setting that you can tweak when starting up the game. Additionally, though the game includes "a" sea unit--because they can be modded as mentioned above--one of the very early technologies allows all ground units to pack themselves up in a virtually unarmed naval transport. With the exception of the turn one needs to dis/embark one's transport, the archipelago set-up is not guaranteed to protect you from the other factions, but may expose your own ground units to the oceanic aliens.... Finally, there are a few pre-set events that will occur during the game at fairly predictable times (e.g. when nearly all factions have entered the 2nd Era of research) that, while thematically interesting the first time around, will continually serve to keep you on your toes.\n\nPandora was my first experience with Slitherine (the developer), and has been wildly successful. If you didn't like the lack of unit customization in Civ IV, or you wanted that sci-fi Civ V experience that we *finally* got in Civ Beyond Earth, or you'd like a very good, "easy-to-learn, difficult-to-master" 4X game, Pandora is for you.","November 30, 2014","true","142.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It resembles Civilization series in many ways. Although it lacks the Civ5s more advanced battle system, it compensates by not being as generic as the previous. Random starting placements are awesome as well as semi-randomised tech-tree. And the planet is nicely alive and feels like a place to explore - more than in any Civilization game.\n\nAll in all if you're looking for a "Civ game" Pandora is a game for you. It manages to keep the game very interesting until the end of alien assault and falls into the same dull end game that plagues Civ games.

Its certainly not a bad game, and I can't point to any specific part of the game that I don't like. It just didn't really excite me either. It could just be that this isn't really my kind of game. I've played a few 4X turn based strategy games, and I do tend to enjoy them, but its not my favourite genre and I'm also not a highly skilled player.\n\nIf you've played Alpha Centauri, then you can stop reading now, because PFC is pretty much exactly the same game, but with different faction names. If you've played any of the Civilization series, PFC is pretty much Civ on an alien planet with future tech. You can decide whether to buy PFC based off your experiences with those games.\n\nPFC has all the standard 4X mechanics. Choose between 6 playable factions, create cities and construct buildings to improve your empire's level of food, research, production, gold, happiness and pollution. Train and upgrade military units, and then either wipe everyone out for a military victory or stay defensive and go for a technology or economic victory.\n\nThe two biggest differences compared to other 4X's are firstly the tech tree has a randomised layout with each new game.

All while you're fighting the local fauna and fungus. And then the invaders. But don't worry, the locals and invaders don't scale at all so as soon as you get a few techs they're easily defeated. This all seems to be pointing to this being a bad game, but it's not terrible the indigienous life is a challenge at first, and the alien invasion can really help turn the tide if someone is way in the lead.

It resembles Civilization series in many ways. Although it lacks the Civ5s more advanced battle system, it compensates by not being as generic as the previous. Random starting placements are awesome as well as semi-randomised tech-tree. And the planet is nicely alive and feels like a place to explore - more than in any Civilization game.\n\nAll in all if you're looking for a "Civ game" Pandora is a game for you. It manages to keep the game very interesting until the end of alien assault and falls into the same dull end game that plagues Civ games. Except Pandora becomes way more dull and unmanageable than any 4X game. On scale to 0-100, as a fan of the genre I'd give it a solid 82.","July 19, 2014","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its certainly not a bad game, and I can't point to any specific part of the game that I don't like. It just didn't really excite me either. It could just be that this isn't really my kind of game. I've played a few 4X turn based strategy games, and I do tend to enjoy them, but its not my favourite genre and I'm also not a highly skilled player.\n\nIf you've played Alpha Centauri, then you can stop reading now, because PFC is pretty much exactly the same game, but with different faction names. If you've played any of the Civilization series, PFC is pretty much Civ on an alien planet with future tech. You can decide whether to buy PFC based off your experiences with those games.\n\nPFC has all the standard 4X mechanics. Choose between 6 playable factions, create cities and construct buildings to improve your empire's level of food, research, production, gold, happiness and pollution. Train and upgrade military units, and then either wipe everyone out for a military victory or stay defensive and go for a technology or economic victory.\n\nThe two biggest differences compared to other 4X's are firstly the tech tree has a randomised layout with each new game. This is either good because every campaign will be unique, or bad because you can't pre-plan your strategy, depending on your point of view. And secondly, food and production is stored at empire level, meaning you can have a city producing zero food, focused entirely on research/gold/production/whatever and your people won't starve because they get food from other cities.\n\nI played two full campaigns which took 9-10 hours each.

The graphics are nice and crisp, the gameplay does not lack much either. There are a few things however I think need to be added to make this game pop out and bring it forward.\n\nFirst, the adding of a Social Engineering ability. YES I am basing this off Alpha Centari because of how good that game was and how great this game can be. The Social Engineering screen allowed you to make the society you wanted through changing between things like (Politics: Democracy, Police State, Fundamentalism) and (Economics: Green, Planned, Free Market) among others. I think this add a sense of in game customization that all players enjoy.\n\nSecond, Option to turn off planet life...there is even on the lowest setting an abundance of planet life that will...destroy your cities, troops, and just overall make your game feel like a race to build units and exhaust resources just to stay alive.\n\nThird, Custom Faction Making...yes I said it, the ability to change the name of your faction, leader, and discription, and maybe even choose your own perks, change unit names and so on.\n\nThis game is still fun as is and I still enjoy playing it, I hope in time there will be more updates and more stuff added.","June 22, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
