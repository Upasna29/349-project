You start the game being chased by wolves in a rudimentary hands-on tutorial on how the basic controls work, introduced to your cubs, and then you start the game off. It is very simulationist and sand-boxy, really setting the mood with beautiful graphics and dynamic scenary/environments despite it's very cartoonish approach.\n\nThe thing is... You have to understand that this -is- a game where you -are- a Mother Lynx who is trying to protect her cubs and keep the family tree going. I'm not joking about that, there is a family tree in the main menu where you can keep track of your lineage and it's no solace that I almost lost a cub to starvation when I ventured the family off into an area that was completely bereft of food.\n\nYour cubs -will- die of starvation if you don't maintain them and they -will- die to predators. When they start to starve, they'll drop to the ground and not follow you anymore; you'll have to bring the food to them or bring them to the food by picking them up. Only deer will feed everyone at once, the rest of the wildlife will have to be split between one or two of the gang.\n\nVery quickly it becomes apparent that the adorable mewlings of your cubs as they roll around in the snow is the same hammer driven nail that aims right for the heart strings when one of them dies.\n\nThis is where the game became a bit too much for me. In the single hour that I spent with these four little guys I became emotionally invested in them and even though I managed to get food for the little guy - saving him from starvation - the genuine worry that I experienced for one of the cubs starving was crippling. The thought of losing him was what drove me to stop playing the game, so once everyone had a decent meal and squared away I exited out.\n\nDo I recommend the game? Absolutely - but you'd better have stronger heart strings than I do.\n\nEDIT: After being convinced by some commenters, I saw fit to see through to the end of this little journey and raised those four little tikes to adulthood and finished the game. It was absolutely astounding for what it was.","March 9, 2015","true","2.2"," 1,847 of 1,901 people (97%) found this review helpful 174 people found this review funny","97","847","1","174","43"

I started playing thinking it would be a fun game to play through once or twice. Playing as the mother of four cubs, this game has a very personal feel to it. Adding that you get to name your cubs at the start makes it even more personal.\n\nWhen I first started to play this game, it was simple enough. I grabbed some of the many rabbits running around the den, then brought them back to my younglings who have yet to gain the strength to walk. When they suddenly got up and started moving, I found it strange how proud I felt. We moved to a new area and started to explore, killed our first deer, fed everyone, was happy. We continued to travel, always using that Star I saw through my Sense as a guide. My cubs grew bigger, stronger. Eventually, they were almost old enough to go off on their own. Everything was well.\n\nThat is, until my perfect world shattered.\n\nOne after another, they grew hungry, and collapsed on the floor. I scambled, trying to get as much food as I could to feed them all. I would get a few back up on their feet, only to have one fall back down as I tried to get more for the last. As I desperately chased a rabbit to bring back to the final cub, I heard her pain filled cry. Nova... my little Nova was gone. I burst out in tears. I couldn't believe it. I REFUSED to believe it. How could this have happened? Everything was going so well... I nearly gave up, but just then I looked back at my three remaining younglings. They were still here, and they still needed me. I had to keep trying. I had to make sure they made it.\n\nAutumn came, and my three cubs have fully grown. As we followed the path we were on, I suddenly noticed they weren't next to me. I stop and look back to see them all staring at me with a sad look on their faces. I knew this day would come; dreaded it. We stand motionless for a few, precious moments, until one by one, they walk away. My heart aches as I watch them disappear behind the treelines. With tears in my eyes, I turn back to the path and keep moving. With nowhere else to go, I head to the only place I know; home. The den where it all started.\n\nAs snow first starts to drift down, I arrive. The tree, almost seeming to welcome me back, hasn't changed at all. Weary and old, I lie down in my den and slowly drift off to sleep for the final time.","March 10, 2015","true","4.5"," 369 of 390 people (95%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","95","369","390","16","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/275100/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","When Shelter first released in 2013 it took players by surprise with its melancholy tale of maternal struggle in the animal kingdom, told through incredibly vibrant picture-book styling and riddled with heart-wrenching moments. With the appearance of a long teased sequel, evolution has taken place and the series makes a daring leap from the confined and contained linear path of the first into much wider and open-ended horizons. Shelter 2 brings us back on a trip through the shifting of the seasons in a natural landscape that breathes with life, ditching the more narrative driven path for an open adventure that encourages free exploration of the many plains, rivers, and forests of this habitat.\n\nThe shift into an open-world style of gameplay feels as natural in Shelter 2 as the setting itself, and puts a higher emphasis on the previous hunting mechanics from before for our carnivorous Lynx family. Starting out on small prey such as rabbits and other critters then working your way up to large and powerful deer when your cubs are large enough which must be brought down with a well placed jump, the bounty of the forests reaches far and wide as you search through snowy woods, swamps thick with reeds, and rocky plains with little vegetation. The astounding hand-painted style that had fans in awe from the first game really shines now with an open approach to level design from the colorful stretches of leaves, grass, and winding blue rivers reaching out miles before you leading to mesmerizing patches of intricately colored trees and mountains.\n\nGiven the open-ended nature and longer progression Shelter 2 is a slow-burning gem compared to its predecessor which shined bright and fast like a shooting star. Instead of shorter scenes the player is now free to roam the wide and open land at their own accord with very little in the way of limits or stress on time. Aside from keeping your four lynx cubs alive and healthy by paying attention to their behavior and the vividness of their color, your goal is simply to exist and explore being a part of the ecosystem around you. The only threat you face in the game comes in the form of surprise attacks in the dead of night from packs of rabid wolves, which admittedly caught me by surprise and got my heart racing as I feared for the life of the cubs I had just spent so much of my time doting on. Only the swiftest of Lynx mothers will be able to avoid these attacks and carry their cubs to safety, mostly ending with the harrowing realization that one of your cubs has disappeared while trailing behind you in the chase.\n\nSwedish musicmakers Retro Family make their triumphant return with another effective soundtrack of fitting folk tunes. Just as before there's a wide variety of melodies here to accompany the different areas of the game and the range of emotions fitting each one, acting as a huge driving force to this wordless story. With uplifting acoustics in the brightness of the spring to the heavy and ominous percussion in the cold dead of winter where wolves loom in the dark, the music is what really crafts the atmosphere surrounding Shelter 2.\n\nMight and Delight come from humble beginnings, from smaller indie games that place a higher value on artistic design than anything else and work from a considerably lower budget than most.. and what they did with Shelter 2 should impress the pants off of anybody, effectively taking all of the fantasies and all of the "what-ifs" players presented while playing the first game and turning them into an open-world reality. While most smaller indie studios would scoff at the idea of turning their artistic pet project into an open-world experience with serviceable hunting mechanics, Might and Delight went for it and actually pulled out with very satisfactory results.\n\nIn the end the imagery and the message is much more positive than before, with a concluding scene that is much less about death and more about life, creation, and thriving as living beings. The openness of the world and lack of "game-y" objective might linger a bit longer than previous players anticipate, but with a real appreciation for the art, the music, and the positive message being portrayed Shelter 2 is rewarding in the end and the kind of experience you remember in the same way you do a childhood picture book.","March 9, 2015","true","11.4"," 253 of 287 people (88%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","88","253","287","11","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mpeterb/recommended/275100/","mpeterb","MrBrongher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mpeterb/","36 products in account","This game seems like a labor of love, and from the reviews  a lot of people have thoroughly enjoyed it, so I hate to slam it. However, I want to make the review I wish I'd read before spending $13.49 on it.\n\nFull disclosure, I played it all the way through once. I used a controller. I never played Shelter 1.\n\nSo, I thought that this would be some kind of immersive, animal simulator/survival game. I anticipated stalking various animals, pouncing on them, maybe carrying the food back to a den or caching it somewhere. I looked forward to being chased by wolves, maybe having a kill stolen by a bear, deciding if I should let a sickly kitten starve so that there would be more food for it's siblings, maybe having one of my kittens just straight up snatched by an eagle. I thought I might get to climb the odd tree, track or stalk prey, and getting alerts from awesome feline ears that something big was coming.\n\nHere's my experience: SPOILERS (such as they are) BELOW.\n\nThe intro is you, a pregnant mother lynx being chased by wolves. This teaches you how to move, run and jump. I never once had to jump in the actual game, and maybe I missed something. You get away and find a cave and make 4 babies. I think you can rename them (6 character max) but I just took the default names. I didn't remember any of them, and if there was a way to access them during the game I didn't find it. I didn't look because I didn't see a need.\n\nYou run around and catch animals by running into them. You don't swipe, or pounce, just ram em while they run and veer. I say animals, but all I ever saw besides those intro wolves were rabbits and something small. Voles? Mice? Whatever. There's the odd bird, but they don't land. Maybe you can jump and catch a low flying one, I didn't try. The rabbits were what fed my family. The intro didn't teach me that there is an energy circle you use while running. Standing or walking recharges it half way. If you eat, then you can completely fill it, but you don't need it, so my mommy lynx fasted for the last half of the game. You feed your kittens in the den a few times and then they're big enough to follow you. Which is a pain if the rabbit you're chasing does a 180 and suddenly you can't tell it apart from the 4 kittens who are also behind you.\n\nThere is a scent button, which opens up this game's version of eagle sight/ wraith vision/ scan mode. The smell screen paints nearby animals in red, and has some symbols which are in no way explained. The tree is your den, and the cat one is one of your kits. The others? I dunno.\n\nEarly on one of my kittens starved. The only way I could tell who was eating more was who was slightly bigger. Eventually the hungry ones stop moving and if you can catch food and bring it to them in time, all better. If not they're gone. The only way to try to direct the food is to pick up the ones you don't want to eat and move them away from the food.\n\nThis whole game made me feel like I was missing something, so I started heading in the direction of a symbol with 3 trees, thinking maybe I could find a deer, or get eaten by a bear. No such luck. It was a woodsier environment than the hill where the den was. I found no food, it was a long ways off, another kitten starved. From then on I stayed within sight of the den. Not that I or the kits ever had to sleep or take Shelter, there were just a lot of rabbits on that hill. You feed the kits, they get a bit bigger and begin occasionally catching their own voles to eat once in a while. Autumn, comes, you're told that seclusion calls to the cubs. They weren't interested in the last rabbit I caught them, then they ran away. Good riddance.\n\nThere are things that you can collect after you or you cubs have eaten, I don't know what they did. There are random collectibles - I do not care. It's bad enough when an assassin is collecting feathers, I am not going to play as a lynx looking for them, especially when that takes time away from feeding my kittens, which is the point here, I thought.\n\nThat's about it. You can play as one of the kits in a new game where they're the mother now, but I don't see why I should. Two hours of chasing rabbits. Thanks.\n\nI've seen a lot of reviews with people saying how invested they are in the game, but I honestly think that's what the player brought to the experience, not anything the game does. It's an atmospheric, idyllic game with no dialogue, so if you're seriously into role playing I can see why you'd love this. Like playing a Skyrim character and making him a vegan sworn never to use a blade. If you want to, it's there, but the game doesn't notice or care. If that's what you like then I do recommend this game. If not, pass.\n\nUpdate: Read many more reviews and watched some videos, and decided to play again to see what I'd missed.\n\n- As soon as the kittens were big enough we set out on a non-stop wander. Specifics will follow, but here's one of my main complaints. This game has two features that I see other reviewers raving about: Your attachment to the kittens, and the beautiful relaxing exploration. I find these two to be completely at odds with each other. If you're attached to the kits then why not just stay put near your den where there are many rabbits and no hazards and feed them non-stop. The main danger in the game is starvation for them, and that always seemed to happen when I was wandering through places with no food. The exploration wasn't remotely relaxing, it was stressful. The feeding mechanic is just a timer to death that can be postponed but never turned off until the cubs leave and the game ends. Again - how is that relaxing?\n\nSo what specifically did I miss on my 1st playthrough?\n\n-I did name the kittens this time. Bronx, Hudson, BK and Lex. I forgot which was which very quickly. My attachment to them did not differ.\n\n-You can make sure the smallest kitten eats first by dropping the food directly in front of it.\n\n- We found and ate frogs. We found a nest on the ground and shook another out of a tree. Ate the eggs. I startled some deer, a fawn ran into me, I caught it, the kittens feasted. Okay.\n\n- We drank at various water sources. Seriously? I completely missed this in my first playthrough. You don't have to drink at all? Plus, it constantly looks like you and the kittens are drowning yourselves. Your entire  head, or entire kitten is underwater. It's just poorly animated though, you'll be fine. Except for the time I slipped down a slope into water. Then the screen went black, I woke up on the bank. I assume time passed and my kittens got hungrier.\n\n- You walk towards the 3 tree symbol to get to the woods. You walk towards the snowflake symbol to reach Snow Land.\n\nI didn't see the wolves again, but then, I'm not really sorry about that. Am I supposed to lead my kittens to the wolves? Is that the relaxing exploration?\n\nI also didn't mention that the smell function lasts about 4 seconds. Smell mode might make hunting better, and would definitely help when chasing white rabbits on snow.\n\nI didn't explicitly point out that you at no time actually have to reach "Shelter" in this game, past the intro. Someone will chime in to say that you have to jump on top of a rock to get away from the wolves, but I wouldn't call that shelter, it's a hiding place.\n\nI also think that if I knew less about animals this might be more fun. As someone in the comments mentioned, this is not how lynx hunt. I might add that wolves are not actually bad jumpers themselves. Although it is true that many lynx kittens starve to death, there are other dangers to them besides one pack of wolves. Going in I certainly thought that at least at the beginning I'd be feeding myself and nursing the kittens. Because, you know, mammals?\n\nIf it wasn't clear, I still think this game was a big let down. If I seem venomous it's only because I feel deceived by all the positive reviews.","March 10, 2015","false","2.8"," 596 of 781 people (76%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","76","596","781","43","32"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/275100/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","The original Shelter was a poetic, intense journey through the life of a momma badger and her journey to find safety for her cubs. It’s one of the most powerful experiences I’ve ever had with a game, relentless and beautiful in its raw exploration of the brutality of nature, and one that I felt stood alone without need of a sequel. To its credit, Might & Delight’s Shelter 2 has arrived full of big ideas and drastic departures from the first; an artistic and emotional feast of burgeoning ambition and creativity. I only wish it had been aware enough to know when to stop the flood.\n\nShelter was a focused, clearly laid out story of one mother and her love for her cubs. It’s themes of protection and vulnerability were what drove the experience forward and fostered the relationship between you and your badger babies, making the potential death of them a terrifying prospect.\n\nShetler 2 in contrast is about nurturing and training your underlings to prepare them for life on their own. Playing now as a Lynx, you become the predator you previously ran from, hunting other animals and traversing a huge expanse of land so as to bring up your cubs ready to fend for themselves. It’s a change relevant not solely to how you play, but also to the relationship between you and those you need to take care of.\n\nWith the absence of any physical threats, the only danger to your cubs is your own negligence, as until they’re grown and able to hunt themselves they depend on you for food and guidance. From the beginning Shelter 2 seems intensely devoted to creating unique bonds between you and your cubs, each distinctly colored and named in contrast to the indistinguishable badger cubs of the first game, and sets you in a position of needing to care for each individually. There are always more mouths to feed than there is food, requiring you pay attention and be sure to feed everyone equally or else breed favoritism which often ends in a cubs death.\n\nDeath is something that’s far less likely to happen in Shelter 2 given the lack of predators or environmental hazards, but it’s no less heart wrenching when it does happen. And even for those that do survive, once they grew and became capable, I found myself abandoned and without a purpose. My lynx’s entire life to that point was to care for her cubs, so what was I to do now I was alone and approaching the end? The sense of pointlessness I took on at that point was overwhelming and taxing. I was free to go where I wanted, gorge myself on a kill, but there was no meaning in it. Whether through death or abandonment, losing that connection to another life in Shelter 2 meant something to me, in ways I couldn’t make sense of and hadn’t felt before.\n\nBut more than an examination on a mother’s loneliness and presumed loss of purpose without a child to care for, Shelter 2 feels like a celebration of life and the joy of sending someone into the world capable of caring for themselves. The ending scene had me in tears not over sadness as the first game did, but joy for the future of the animals I’d journeyed with. It’s a brief but immensely impactful few minutes that finally helped me make sense of my mixed feeling on everything that came before.\n\nHowever it feels disingenuous to forget those elements, as for how much the ending meant to me, and how incredible many of the moments leading up to it were, they were effectively bookends for the core of the game. It’s this core that I found so troubling, because it seems to so entirely pull away from what makes Shelter so affecting. As far as I can make sense of it, Shelter 2 feels a need to show how it’s more of a “game” than the first.\n\nHunting and surviving are now centered around very traditional mechanical sets: chase the highlighted prey, eat them and watch your hunger meter rise; fill out your map and collect shiny doodads for your journal. They’re elements the first game had, but the emphasis how now been put onto them in ways I found distracting and unneeded. I wanted to bond with my cubs and teach them how to hunt, but I was constantly being prompted and urged to partake in more binary, game-y tasks which frankly aren’t very good.\n\nThe world is huge but there’s nothing to do within it; a gorgeous set which you can see and run through but otherwise are unable to interact with. Hunting is tedious and repetitive, as rabbits and elk are your only prey and catching them only requires running fast enough to automatically chomp them in two. Beneath the parts that make Shelter 2 so wonderful I found these pieces easy to ignore, but pulled to the forefront as they are for most of the game I was bored and feeling as if there was something missing. What was the point of the world if there was nothing in it? Why is hunting such a prominent element of the game when it's so limited in scope?\n\nI don’t think I’ll ever forget the moments which really spoke to me in Shelter 2, like getting caught in a sandstorm and frantically looking for my cubs, or stumbling upon a giant herd of elk as my cubs were beginning to starve. But Might & Delight has greatly deluded them by placing them under the weight of mechanics which never grow past their primitive first impression, and too much time searching for something which doesn’t exist in its huge world. I appreciate the risks which were taken with Shelter 2 and how much it avoids attempting to repeat the experience of the first game. I only wish it had been confident enough in what Shelter has always been - bold and elegant and personal - instead of trying to crib from games it couldn’t hope to match.\n\nFull disclosure: Shelter 2 was reviewed using a copy provided by the developer.

As you watch them grow older and begin to be able to hunt things themselves you are filled with a sense of pride. Then suddenly they stop walking and when you call to them they don't respond, suddenly they begin to run off into the distance and you try to run after them, but you cant. You go back to your den alone and felt with sadness, until you are awaken in the night by the whispers of the stars again. You follow the path of light they lay until you reach a hill filled with flowers and firelies in the sky. Suddenly another lynx appears in a red glow and you two both look at each other and walk off into the night. Fin.\n\nThe game has a few glitches, but nothing game braking.

All my cubs survived, but in the family tree it only showed 3/4 of my cubs and one's line wasn't connected to the rest oddly as if there is a space of where my missing cub should be. Overall great game, very interesting concept, and I look foward to continuing my family tree and getting the expansion pack of the game.

The game follows the life cycle of the lynx family from birth and envelops the player in its gripping, emotional story. This story, however, is simply told in an understated manner; and develops organically during gameplay. Game dynamics are simple, yet new ones are slowly introduced seamlessly as the game unfolds. It is the explorative, meditative character of the experience which sets it apart. Explore, hunt, discover and provide for your cubs; as you successfully do this, you cannot help but realize that the universal struggle for survival is not singular to your family. The prosperity of your family comes at the expense of ravaging the lower rungs of the food chain. As a lynx, right in the middle of the food chain, its just a matter of time until the circle of life has its way. There are no higher stakes than the game of life.\n\nIf you are in the mood for a slow paced game with a beautiful, large, natural world to explore, including day/night cycles, seasons and a unique flat shaded polygon aesthetique, you will truly appreciate the effortless, graceful manner in which this game tells its story.\n\nFull Review, No spoilers:\n\nIntro, Story and Gameplay sections abridged to avoid spoilers.\n\nExperience the struggles of a mother lynx as she provides for her cubs and as the seasons of the year and stages of life progress. You start as a lone pregnant lynx; first sequence of the game is relatively linear, and reminiscent of the original Shelter. However, after this scene you are confronted with the wide-open expansive world that this iteration provides.\n\nDesign:\n\nMeticulously drawn landscapes with meandering rivers, tree ladden forests, populated lakes, central valleys and hilltops can all be explored at your leisure. The unique look of the game entices the player to continue exploring the habitat and get to know the different areas and terrain features.\n\nCharacters, including cubs and other animals, have all been designed with loving care. Each of your cubs has a different fur coat, which allows you to assure you feed them all. Other animals also have a charming aesthetique, which you can appreciate while stalking and hunting them as they trudge, borrow and graze along in an appealing, animated world.\n\nSound:\n\nThe real standout on this front is the music; which has impeccable, professional production value. It was once again created by Retro Family[retrofamilysounds.blogspot.com]. You can feel the vibration of each strum, the rumble of each drum, the crispness and immediacy of the sound. Music is the voiceless narrator which, along with the evocative art, sets the tone of this story. Game music is varied and fitting to the different stages, situations and environments.\n\nSound effects are serviceable and, even though fitting, can grow repetitive. Some of them are quite subtle and amazing; such as the sound of you/your cubs eating.\n\nReplayability:\n\nReplay value is provided by the availabilty of achievements and to follow/grow your family line. Even though each life cycle is generally similar to the last, the expansive open-world and the beautiful art does entice you to continue exploring. You might also want to re-play while mantaining all of your cubs alive. Generally speaking, 3-5 hours should be sufficient time to explore a good portion of the world and develop at least 3 generations. However, the game can be enjoyed for way longer than this; especially if you wish to be meticulous in the exploration of the different habitats and complete the achievements. The game has 5 steam trading cards, and provides 3 drops.\n\nConclusion:\n\nShelter 2 is a unique, contemplative experience. The incredible music and its particular hand-drawn style set the tone for the touching, emotional journey through the life of the lynx family. The goal and controls of the game are simple, this understated style lends itself to provide a poignant, memorable experience. If you enjoyed the original Shelter or are in the mood for a short simple game; one which tells a touching story of life in the animal kingdom through a synergy of music and art, I invite you to give Shelter 2 a try.","April 8, 2015","true","3.3"," 60 of 70 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","60","70","2","11"

It's a third person singleplayer survival adventure game, set in a beautiful semi-open world where you play as a mother Lynx that's trying to survive and protect her self along side her children.\n\nThe graphics, the art style is arguably beautiful, with a nice mix of different but distinctive textures, viewed in vast open areas, with all the small effects and wiled life going about, and the sound effects from birds chirping to winds flowing to grass and leaves moving, coupled with an amazing soundtrack, it brings the game to life for one to enjoy in.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhaJzNC4qwA\n\nThe semi-open world is fun to play around in, where you have to run in its open fields and find prey to hunt down, giving them to your cubs (baby Lynxes) to eat, and then adventuring to other areas for refreshments. Aside from hunting, eating, and exploring, you also have to occasionally survive the nights, escaping and surviving from the ones who hunt you, the wolves.\n\nThe story of the game, and its adventure to the end of it, is amazingly charming and heartwarming, surviving, giving birth, protect and helping your cubs to survive, experiencing loss, and then moving forward, possibly seeing this cycle again with the same amazing impact. It was a lovely story/adventure to see and play through, one that will have different impactful results because of your actions.\n\nThe bad things about the game is the mouse controls are weirdly made, where the vertical movement is heavily limited for some reason. The other issue is small but worth mentioning, is that the game doesn't give you a clear idea on what you have to do in its open fields, when you do something that will progress the game at some point, you're not really sure how and why it happened.\n\nOverall Shelter 2 was and is amazingly charming and adorable, I was sucked into its charm in the first 15 minutes, and then continued to be engulfed by it throughout my playthrough, throwing emotional bombs at me. From begging to end, the game was an emotional roller coaster, bringing me from true joy to extreme sadness, almost to tears. Although short, it was a quality experience with incentivised replay value, it's a game worthy of praise.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","March 9, 2015","true","2.9"," 75 of 94 people (80%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","80","75","94","10","12"

Though sometimes it would abruptly stop in a very weird way.\nFor those who like collectibles, there are plenty.Cons:\nCamera can be annoying.\nGets boring quickly as the only thing to do is feed your kits.\nTo hunt animals all you do is smash your face into them.\nCan't do anything to defend your family except run/hide.\nThe game gives you no reason to leave the starting area other than collectibles.  With plenty of rabbits there, and from what I've seen, no predators, it's the perfect spot.\nIn other reviews people say they're very attached to their kits, but I don't know how.  I'm a very devout cat lover, but the cats in game don't have any emotions or personality.  You can't interact with them in any way except feeding.

The art is gorgeous.\n2- Atmospheric music that perfectly conveys the mood and warns of danger. Music is AMAZING\n3- Collectibles and family tree adding a sense of progression\n4- Large world for plenty of exploration\n5- Kitties! Yes people love kitties. And you get to be their mum. The perfect concept to establish emotional bonds for the player.\n\nCons: (take a deep breath)\n1- Some of the most cryptic instructions I have ever seen in a video game. You have to guess from the medley of symbols and one word descriptions how to survive with 4 mouths to feed (5 including your own) and find shelter. You also need to discover everything through trial and error. Some people might like this, but if you prefer clear instructions and statistics like I do, you will absolutely hate this game. Period.\n\n2- The terrain is beautiful... but it is functionally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Seriously, if you thought you could jump and climb on rocks and cliffs like in other games, NO. You can only jump in "designated jumping areas". Some places are unreachable by jumping because the smooth sloping cliffs were not programmed for standing on them. It immediately breaks my immersion. I couldn't give 2 ♥♥♥♥♥ about "feeding kittens" if rough boulders are too slippery to climb on at the height of summer.\n\n3- Realism? Forget about it! The game is supposed to portray the life and struggle of a lynx family, but you can't climb up most slopes, and if you walk 2 steps too deep into water, you drown and you get revived in a different season. WTF. Seriously, what just happened?! In the real world, Lynxes are actually some of the best swimmers among felines!\nBut the game decides "Nope, water = instant death + time travel forward". How could I have guessed that? Is this a bug?\n\n4- Arbitrary disappearance: I understand "survival" and "random events". But if you turn around for 30 seconds, one of your kits will magically disappear! No predators. No hawks. No pitfalls. No hunter traps. No land mines. No alien abduction. One minute it was healthy and walking, suddenly your healthiest kitten is gone without a trace and without any warning sound cues.\nThe game arbitrarily decided that one of your kits MUST GO, with no explanation whatsoever. I seriously could not tell if this was a bug or if there are invisible enemies in the game. WHY DID THE KITTEN DISAPPEAR? No clear explanation. Next!\n\n5- When I kill a hawk (or eagle or whatever), is there any reason why I can't eat his body or feed him to my kittens? I killed the ♥♥♥♥er fair and square when he tried to steal my kits, so why can't I eat him like normal carnivores do when they are STARVING? Hell, when you use your "sense" thing his corpse is actually highlighted in red, but you can't  do anything with his body. Maybe I had to unlock a special skill to eat hawks? If so, WHY? He's fresh meat, and I'm a carnivore!\nOnce again, these arbitrary "game survival rules" immediately break my immersion.\n\n6- Survival stats ABSENT: In normal mode, I have no idea if I am supposed to feed myrself to survive, or just to maximize my "stamina". There are no health bars (or any indicators for that matter).\nYour kits need food constantly, like seriously these little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s eat more meat than a Primal Zerg on steroids. And yet there is no clear visual indicator of their health or status. The only thing they do when they're exhausted is lie down and start mewing at you. That's it. How am I supposed to prioritize which of them to feed? A mother lynx would be able to tell who is the weakest of her litter so she can feed that bugger before he collapses and becomes unable to move. But here, you can't tell jack!\n\n7- Your senses suck: Yes, when you click the right mouse button, you can see all relevant objects. But god forbid if you can see your kittens clearly. The symbols for "kitten" are so floaty and disappear quickly when you get 6 feet close to them, I actually struggled to find them after returning from a hunt because their colors blend in with the terrain. Is it too much to ask to add some contrast to their colors so I can CLEARLY SEE where they are? Or how about a blue outline around your kittens when using your sense?\n\n8- Left click to drop prey + right click to tell your kittens to go away + left click again to eat the food yourself.\nCan't you just "Press E to interact with object" instead of this nonsense? Did you have to be "special" instead of doing things like normal games do? Why did you make it so that the left mouse button is the button that does everything?\nHow about "Left click to pick up/drop object" "Press E to eat object" "Press Q to summon/dismiss your kittens"? Simple and straighforward!\n\n\nI could say more...\nLong story short, this game is the perfect college art project, and the perfect game for artsy hipster type players who prefer abstract conceptual demonstration over gameplay and content. I'm just telling it like it is.\nGreat concept and style. Mediocre gameplay execution. Even people who liked it played it for maximum 15 hours and got bored with it (check the positive reviews for reference)\n5/10","May 26","false","1.0"," 55 of 70 people (79%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","79","55","70","10","1"

Years and years I waited for a game that fit the bill that Shelter 2 fills and I couldn't be more thrilled with the game!\n\nShelter 2 is a survival game where you raise 4 Lynx cubs to adulthood. You face starvation and predators in your effort to maintain your family tree. Your cubs follow you around once they're strong enough and will be of little to no help to you or themselves until they're almost grown up meaning you have to hunt their food down and feed them else they'll starve. Luckily, most prey in the game (with the exception of mice) will feed at least 2 of your cubs and they spread out in a fan pattern when you hold prey, making it easy to choose who you feed. Once they're old enough, sometimes they'll catch prey of their own; some are more ambitious than others. :)\n\nThe one complaint I had for the first Shelter is that there was almost no way to 'fail' in terms of feeding your kiddies unless you stood there and purposely made little Timmy starve. This installment definitely raises the stakes and makes things much more difficult; I've observed less food in the winters compared to the other seasons (namely spring, when rabbits are overflowing) and it definitely keeps you on your toes. Better yet, in Shelter 2, mama lynx needs to eat, too! The circle in the lower-left part of the screen indicates her 'stamina'. Her stamina fills up when she stops running but it will hit a 'stop' after a bit; in order to fully fill the circle, she must eat. I really enjoyed this realistic addition, it certainly adds a bit more challenge to juggling feeding schedules!\n\nI'm on playthrough #5 on my family tree and I intend to keep it going! The biggest plus for me (because I have always liked this sort of thing!) is the fact that each of your cubs - like the badger cubs in Shelter - have different coat colors/patterns! The patterns differ from cub to cub (I have had one white cub who had 'crow feet' patterning all over her, whereas one had a simple yet delicate and endearing floral/petal pattern on her) and when you choose which of your cubs to play in the next generation at the end of playthrough, you keep that cub's looks! :) To me, this was a huge plus because I've always wanted a game that did this but most used a cookie-cutter animal/character that looked exactly like the original one even when the baby vastly differed. It gives each playthrough a touch of individuality and got me more connected to each set of cubs. (What? I didn't play favorites, nope. Totally not)\n\nThe graphics in Shelter 2 are very similar to Shelter's and they're absolutely gorgeous! The colors are a lot better this time in my opinion, actually! My laptop can't handle the higher settings but even while running 'Low' I find the scenery gorgeous and it did not disappoint! Night time has been greatly improved from the first Shelter and the controls overall are easier to use, at least for me.\n\nOverall, I would and will recommend this game to gamers I know, it is definitely worth the money - it is a wonderful, albeit emotionally impacting, gaming experience!\n\n*** Pros ***\n- No designated 'go from A to B' as was seen in Shelter, you may roam where you please\n- Game presents a decent amount of challenges to keep things interesting\n- A lot of re-play potential!\n- Collection system where you gather certain things in the world around you\n- Beautiful storybook-style graphics\n- There is a bit of a narrative to the game this time around, giving us a little more story!\n- Family Tree makes it more motivating to keep all your cubs alive and is fuel for another playthrough\n- Beautiful music! It is very atmospheric and it really immersed me in the game, adding to the mood!\n- ... You're a lynx and you get to run around and kill deer/rabbits and you have cute cubs. I think this is a 'pro' all on its own.\n\n*** Cons ***\n- Some computers might find it difficult to run Shelter 2 (I used a general laptop and experienced a lot of overheating/FPS inhibiting, but nothing a quick game restart didn't resolve)\n- There are some small glitches (at the time of posting this) with starving cubs; some of mine refused to take food when starving and thus died\n- This is not a game for the faint of heart; if you get very emotionally invested/death of children and/or similar material does bother you greatly, Shelter 2 may prove difficult to play/enjoy as it is a survival game!\n- I discovered in the game that the 2nd part of the map you access (with the lake) is pretty much the best place to stay; I love the addition of more map sections but I do think the game could have used something to force/urge players to explore the other map sections/use them (There are deer - perhaps migratory patterns for those would have been a good idea!).\n\nThat's pretty much all I can think of right now, but I've spent most of my day playing it and I've been eagerly anticipating it since I discovered it when I found Shelter! I am very happy with this game and I definitely don't regret buying it! I think everyone should give this game a go, it's worth it!","March 10, 2015","true","12.0"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","32","35","2","0"

However, I made the right decision to buy Shelter 2 when it was on discount because I got far less gameplay experience from it compared to Shelter. Seasons go by too quickly. I never made it to tundra before it was time to say goodbye to my cubs. In fact, I managed to do very little exploring at all due to how quickly seasons passed. I like the idea of more of an open world versus Shelter's levels, but it was still way too fast-pased for my taste.\n\nI also encountered few audio bugs when suddenly my audio completely disappeared. Controls are also a bit hard, camera doesn't follow as well as I'd like it to and sometimes turning is very painful.

A sweet basic animal survival simulator as a mother Lynx and definitely a improvement from the first game. If they ever make a third Shelter id buy it as well (online multiplayer would be a huge plus). Its a perfect game for animal and nature lovers with big open world to roam as much you like. I really like that it plays out like a story book. The gameplay is made pretty simple, not like dont starve advanced but still works perfectly.\nThe game allows you to go on also when not having cubs which is also neat as you can roam the place but it gets rather quickly boring as there is no new challenge or much to do than start a new family tree with another 4 cubs. Young gamers will definitely love this game to fool around and do small roleplaying.\n\nNow when i made my first two playtroughs i guess i was lucky to not meet the wolves. I wish there was more than a small hill as safe zone againts them.\n\nPerhaps more shelters than the one at the begining would be great as gamers may have other favorite spots to hang out and would love to have some cave/nest around those areas.\n\nAnimals like foxes,eagles and badgers didnt make it into shelter 2 from previous game which was a dissapointment.\nAlso sneaking trough taller grass doesnt has any camoflage effect like in first game allowing you to get even more near the prey. Perhaps it isnt necessary detail as you can still catch the prey but its always neat when the prey will never know what hit it.\n\nDeers are my favorite to hunt but i think the game could had easylie add at least a single buck in each herd, you just put antlers on that thing to give them some bigger variation.\n\nThe game could had also allowed sneaking up even closer to the prey when aproaching it from behind.

No.\n\nSo that's not why this is a great game.\n\nLet me tell you a story:\n\nMother Lynx ran for her life; wolves were on her scent. She escaped, barely. She was then led by the stars to her new home, where she gave birth to four adorable babies: Fur, Kit, Kudvu, and Flippy. She caught three bunnies for them and they started follow her. Inna could not be more proud of her babies. She killed bunnies and fed her babies. She kept close to the tree, ready for whatever was coming. Then night came. The darkness came. Inna froze for a split second as she saw a large brown blob flow from the mountains and towards her and her children. She didn't know what it was; but she knew it was not getting her babies. She grabbed one in her mouth, then turned and bolted, leaving the other three to run after her. She reached the tree quickly, and walked to the front of her den, dropping the baby in her mouth. The other three came over, yowling with annoyance. Inna remained quiet, watching the blob that was no longer moving. Sniffing, she realized no animals were nearby. She started telling the blob to go away. She then watched in satisfaction as it drained away. Seasons went past, and then that faetful day came. She killed two rabits and walked over to them with her children. They all stared at her. A sinking feeling rose in her chest as she read the exporessions of her babies. She sighed, but not in sorrow. She was ready for them to go. Nudging each of them with her nose, she said farewell and watched them run off. She walked back to her home, and fell asleep. She woke up and the stars guided her to a strange area. Something was there. Inna crouched, ready to fight. She crept closer, and then she saw who it was. Kudvu! Her sweet Kudvu! Inna walked over to her baby, overjoyed. The two walked off, Kudvu ready to protect his mother until she died.\n\n\nThat was my ffirst playthrough. After, I played as Flippy, who had Navi, Kiwi, Ezra, and someone else that I can't remember. Like before, they all lived. Then I played as Navi, who had Sparta, Vivani, Icicle, and Paw. They all lived.\n\nThe game is fun to play and in the end, some people are upset when their babies leave, others were ready for them to go after 20 minutes and were glad to no longer have to worry about them. You feel a sense of pride as you watch them walk away, calling out helpful and supportive things. And in the end, you smile. Killing rabits isn't mundane. And you can laugh as you say "You see that kids? Mommy just killed a rabit with her face!" And smile. I really want to have a fox shelter 3. Though if my babies died, I'd die. FOXES ARE AWESOME.\n\nThe shelter is the safest place. I'd go out a bit for bunnies, kill a bunch, then decide to head back to the tree for safety. When that glob of doom first came when I played, I was screaming "WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?! WHAT DA HECK IS THAT!? RUN! RUNN!! WHAT DA HECK!?" And running. It was a real sense of danger, as you didn't know what the threat really was, but you knew you couldn't let it get too close or bye-bye baby.\n\nThat was the only disacter i'VE encountered. People report wildfires, wolves, and eagle attacks. I've never seen them. Stacyplay's roleplay showed me the wolves, and that was why I stayed near the den. The den is like a barrier. The mudslides don't get near it, eagles never swoop down and take your kids, wolves don't come near, and fires don't come closer. I assume. I only am sure about the mudslide thing.\n\nPeople have complained about how this isn't true to life; that you fight every second. Would people still enjoy the game if it WAS like that? Would you enjoy fighting for 5 deefnseless cubs every second, all the while hunting and kill to feed them, and having to fight WHILE feeding them? I wouldn't buy this game if it was like that. I'd hate it.\n\nLuckily, this game doesn't have all tbat. The game's graphics don't make it too gory, and luckily your little kittens are so cute you don't care that you're slaughtering bunnies for about 2 hours. ^^\n\nThis was a good game, even though I don't play it often.","April 9","true","7.0"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","18","19","2","0"

The charming art style makes a return and this time, you get to play as a momma lynx. The music is relaxing, as it should be and the open world really draws you in. Your main goal is to protect your family, hunting down prey for them to fill their bellies until they get older and lead them away from the dangerous wolves. Survival is key and this game will really make you connect with the lynx. Also, the gamma is no longer as blinding.\n\nOverall, the game is a huge improvement from the first but that doesn't mean it has no flaws. The game is now a lynx simulator/ survival game with no end game in mind. With that, the game may get repetitive and boring after a while. Hunt, feed, run. Certainly not as engaging as the first game, where there was an actual mini story.\n\nThe camera controls are also quite strange, with the vertical movement being extremely limited. The game also offers little to no explanation of how you managed to progress. It's a little confusing at first but easy to figure out with patience.\n\nThat being said, this game is still a wonderful gem and I'd say it's totally worth it for the novel experience.","March 9, 2015","true","4.8"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","18","25","2","0"

Choosing the lynx, a large, swift hunter, Might and Delight had to step up from the rather streamlined, linear level design of Shelter 1 and had to offer a landscape that made the chase for prey believable.\n\nShelter 2 teaches the same base principles of nature it's predecessor already embraced. The difference is, that it gives the player more power to direct where his journey goes. Some people find that this makes the progression feel too open ended and undirected.\nFor me the design makes the story and world feel more realistic, putting less emphasis on the show and giving the message within more power.\n\nAs with Shelter 1, this game is a relaxing experience that engages mind and emotions.

I was really taken aback at how beautiful and yet simplistic this game was.\n\nYou start as a pregnant mother lynx running from wolves until you come across a den. Once you litter of four has been born it's time to begin hunting to provide for your young. Once you have fed them a couple of times the kittens join you on your adventuring around three biomes. You can find eggs, hunt rats rabbits and deer to feed your family. Over the course of the game the seasons pass and the kittens grow. By the third season they are young adults and beginning to hunt themselves. Once a full year has passed, the now adult lynxes wander off to form their own families and the circle of life continues. Over the year you face a few challenges, packs of wolves hunting your kittens. Scarcity of prey and becoming exhausted yourself. I was proud that my first attempt I managed to keep all four kittens alive to adulthood.\n\nThis game while it had little replay ability for me personally I found beautiful and quite profound. I had not come across a game like this before that really brought out my paternal instincts even though I played as the mother.

I did not play the first game, but the idea seems to be pretty much the same but with different animals. I love the graphics and the theme (mother trying to raise her cubs), and while I did well, the game did not explain anything other than the basic controls. I figured out quickly enough that the symbols in the distance were other areas, but it did not explain the significance (if any) to collecting the various items. A couple of times I picked something up and a window came up briefly with an animal icon and one letter (C for one and M for the other). I still have no idea what it means. Am I spelling something?? I enjoyed playing and I did feel a sense of attachment to my babies, but I feel like there could have been a lot more to this game.\n\nThe only other animals I encountered were mice, rabbits, deer, frogs, and wolves. The first 3 are prey. I don't think there's any way you can fight off or defend against wolves, so I just ran away. Eating a prey animal will restore your stamina (the circle on the bottom left), running will deplete it. You can stop and rest or just walk for a bit, but it will not restore the whole thing.\n\nIt's hard to say whether or not I would recommend it. I don't have a solid yes or no. I'd say watch some let's plays and then make your choice.","March 14, 2015","true","2.6"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","18","28","0","0"

(Video Review Below)\nI can't think of many games that can get me so emotionally involved without any narrative.\nFrom the moment the game starts your breath is taken away. Might and Delight took their unique art style and sent it to the next level. Giving such intricate detail but still maintaining that hand painted look. From the expression on your cubs faces to the waving of the trees in the wind.\nI could go on and on about how beautiful the soundtrack to Shelter 2 is. It matches the tone of the game and sends chill down your spine when there is silence.\nOne thing to note is how different this is from the first Shelter. This is now more of a open world experience. You are free to hunt and explore the surroundings. Feeding your cubs and making sure they survive is now a more relaxed experience. However this doesn't change the utter terror you feel when the hunters become the hunted. Wolves will come for you. I had to pause it several times during these moments how scared I was for my cubs.\nNature is represented here in its raw form. Elegant and deadly.

The style, music and atmosphere the game creates is up there with the best of them, Journey, etc. Hunting prey and roaming the wild was fun through out. Gameplay seemed solid. It felt like I was controling a wild cat. Family tree lets you continue to play with any remaining cubs that made it to adult hood. And lastly, did I mention this was an incredible work of art? Oh I did.. well on to the bad then.\n\nThe Bad: The game was just a tease. The devs here had tapped into my dream game. So the fact that the game only lasted 1 hour and 40 minutes was a let down. Someone get Chris Roberts to whip up a Kickstarter for Shelter 3 because I would gladly pay much more $ for a lengthy wildlife survival game. I mean we get a new zombie survival game every month. Can't I get one MMO wildlife survial game? Anyways that's my beef with the game. That and there were a lack of predators and what seemed to be an abundance of food even though 3 of my cubs still starved so I have not yet figured out how fast time is moving in the game.\n\nI got the game for $10.

You give birth to four cubs that you can name(Snowi, Berri, Cooki, and Russel) and you have to feed them and keep them safe. But if one of them dies it is absolutely heart-wrenching. I've found some strategies that help to prevent that\n\nStay close to the den. There's a dark mist that comes every once in a while and it limits your vision, which doesn't help at all when you're running from wolves.\n\nIf your cub lays down on the ground and starts meowing, it's starving. Get it food ASAP or it'll starve to death and make a wailing sound that will tear your heart out.\n\nTake turns feeding your cubs. They always circle around you in the same order, so dropping the food to your left will feed cubs 1 and 2, in front of you feeds 2 and 3, and to your right feeds 3 and 4. if you catch a mouse or vole or whatever the little brown creature is, it only feeds one cub, or yourself. If you eat a rabbit, there won't be any left for the cubs. Deer feed all 4 cubs, but I haven't caught one yet so I can't confirm that.\n\nYou don't need to drink water in this game, so don't worry if you can't find any.\n\nYou don't need to feed yourself often, if at all. I think I only ate once or twice throughout the game without a problem.\n\nI survived staying close to home, and I haven't quite explored the game to the full extent yet.

The art style, user interface, and music all blend together to make you feel like a piece of a majestic and unforgiving, yet fragile world.  The cubs you raise respond to your voice, get excited for food, play, and taking care of them feels very real and natural.\n\nAll of the little details that most games would gloss over, this game executes beautifully.\n\nThe problem is that everything else about the game is sloppy, poorly implemented, or lacking in substance.\nThe gameplay is extraordinarily simple: you move, hunt, and feed either your cubs or yourself.  This presents the opportunity for interesting risk-reward tradeoffs: do I eat this rabbit I have killed to try and get enough strength to hunt a deer or feed it to my cubs lest they become too weak to follow me?  Unfortunately, there is no reason to ever feed yourself as you never actually get weaker while your cubs do, or at least can.  I say "can" because prey is generally so abundant and easy to catch that it is actually quite difficult for a cub to starve (especially once you realize there is no reason to feed yourself).  Furthermore, for a game supposedly about the dangers of rearing cubs in the wilderness, there is very rarely any actual danger to yourself or your cubs.  In two playthroughs I have only seen wolves (the only danger I have yet seen) once in each playthrough, and always in the same area.  Weather and other natural events seem to pose no threat whatsoever or have any effect on gameplay;  for a game called "Shelter", shelter seems to matter very little.\nThe problem is that, once you learn how to efficiently hunt prey and navigate the world, the game becomes very easy and, as a result, dull.\n\nThe game is also quite short: in about an hour and a half I was able to raise a set of cubs and complete the game.  You can then choose to continue playing and raise another litter of cubs as one of your offspring from the previous litter, but the game plays exactly the same way every time (even down to the number and coloration of the cubs) so little replayability is gained.\n\nDespite all of this and annoying camera angles I found this game to be worth its meagre pricetag, but the enjoyment was mostly from the general atmosphere the game delivers, the little things that the game does so well, than from any particular gameplay experience.  Despite the repetitive nature of the hunt, I was excited to feed my kittens, and they were excited to be fed.  And it was genuinely poignant when Autumn came, they stopped following me, gave one last chirp and parted from their mother to make their own way in the desolate, beautiful taiga.  If only more of the stark, unforgiving nature of the environment had been added to the gameplay instead of being limited to the background, if the dangers augmented so that "shelter" was more an in-game necessity than just a name, this game could have truly been amazing.\n\n","March 9, 2015","true","6.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

The stamina mechanic makes travelling incredibly slow, and the only things to really do are to hunt for your cubs or search for the ridiculously large number of collectibles, all of which are fairly difficult to spot.\n\nOn top of that, it takes about an hour to complete normal mode, and things are so unintuitive that it wasn't until I started my fifth generation that I understood what the ending was supposed to be.

Its pretty hard to show in a trailer just how much of an impact a game like this can have on your heart.\n\nAt its core, Shelter 2 is a pretty simple game. Catch animals, let the cubs eat, they get bigger, keep them safe from predators. Rinse an repeat till done. However the way it kinda just drops you in an letting you figure out the mechanics on your own in my opinion helps reinforce the idea of motherhood. You trial an error with your first, learn from your mistakes an get better with time. But the way the game feels is hard to show off.\n\nIn my play through I wasn't sure what to do at first. Caught an animal an brought it to the cubs an they got up to follow me to my delight. So onward I went, figuring out if I ate my stamina would regenerate further. So I did, an one of the cubs soon fell to the ground as it was hungry. So I would make sure they all ate after that. Soon after exploring new areas, I heard a howl. Wolves. "No biggie" I thought an charged forward, "I can take them" said my gaming brain. I then saw the wolf, then two, four, eight, ten. An remembered, the cubs are following me. They cant fight. So I turned an ran, but wasn't sure where to go. Soon I heard the cry of one of the cubs being killed as the pack of wolves ran away. At first I  kinda chuckled, "oh they're kind of like extra lives." an pressed on. I learned how to keep safe from the wolves, an the longer I played, the more I felt bad about losing one of my cubs as the others slowly grew. A weight on my shoulders, I became more protective of the ones I had left. Constantly looking back to make sure they were behind me an hardly eating myself, letting them have it all. Seasons passed an they grew up, soon the same size as me. Then, there was a moment. It was that time, the cubs were grown up, it was time for them to go out into the world on their own lives. There was a long silence before they all parted ways. I was happy they made it, yet sad they were going. In my head I was saying "Dont go" with tears in my eyes. But I knew there wasn't much I could do to stop them. I was now alone, the credits had not rolled yet. free to explore on my own, reflecting on the long journey I had with my Lynx family. The times watching them play an roll around. The times wolves were barking an scraping at a cliff to try an get us on our safe ledge. And the one I had let get killed because of my actions.\nI realized something right then as I made my way back to the den where it all started. I had just gotten a taste of what most real mothers go through in their lives. Putting the child before your own well being. Becoming protective of your child when something traumatic had happened. As well as the conflicting emotions of letting your child go when they've grown up. They cant stay with you forever after all.\n\nFor me, it was quite an eye opener an soon after playing. I went to visit my parents an gave them a big hug for all they did for me.\n\nNow back to the question. How to you sell this in a trailer to someone glued to action packed games?\nIts hard for sure on a game like this where the fun is the journey.\n\nWould I recommend this game though? Very much so! It hit my heart more then any mainstream game I've played.\nGranted its not a very long game at all. But I got more out of it in those few hours then I did in a 40 hour game.\nJust go in with an open mind.

You would be forgiven for lamenting that this is just another one of those 'survival games' set to the backdrop of a bleak wilderness, in which death is your only obstacle. Indeed, this is something to concern you with but the focus here leans towards a more adult look into videogames as both an art form and the maternal strife of raising and protecting ones offspring that is so finely woven into our own primordial nature. If you allow; Shelter 2 can very quickly become a powerful facet that will engulf the heartstrings in many ways.\n\nThe player will assume control of a pregnant Lynx named Inna who must seek shelter in the dead of night from a harsh unspecified winter tundra. Immediately the player is pursued by a pack of ravenous wolves that will stop at nothing to tear Inna limb from limb. Once the cubs are born, they can be named to the player’s desire and it is up to them to provide food and water to nurture the cubs by hunting Rabbits, Mice and Deer as well as raiding trees for birds’ nest eggs to provide additional sustenance.\n\nThe narrative is broken up into chapters that pass the passage of time as the player watches their cubs come of age leading to their inevitable disbanding as they go their own way out into the wide open world. Something I imagine that pulls on the heartstrings of every parent or child who might play this. It is an evocative and moving experience that is supported with a wondrous ambient soundtrack that hits those emotional cues at just the right moments for the optimal effect.\n\nThis is all but a microcosm of the possibilities the player will have to endure as they make their way across a small sandbox world teeming with an ecosystem that is a spectacle and natural beauty to behold. The world itself is split up into three large areas to explore at your leisure and each with its own striking vistas to look upon as the seasons shift and change from spring through winter. Sad then to say that, this does not bring about any gameplay changes or mechanics so much as it is there to serve only the voyeur.\n\nThe choice of art direction/style in this game helps to serve its tranquil tempo as a soothing, emotional experience by connoting in it; the post-modern works of Vincent Van Gogh or the bold pastelline colours of Paul Gauguin. It serves an artifice tone in nature that can provide some blistering beauty that all players can appreciate.\n\nThe controls may come under some scrutiny from those who prefer controllers over the mouse and keyboard as the former is not an available play option. However for the most part the controls are responsive and well mapped allowing almost anyone to pick up and play with ease. It becomes unwieldy in tighter areas like canyons or ravines but thankfully the game plays to its strengths by keeping the player out in the vast open plains where movement is unhindered.\n\nShelter 2 will not appeal to the average gamer as it will provide only some small challenge to those who are well adept to furious gunplay and tactical simulation, which is a shame however as I would urge this demographic to at least try something out of their comfort zone; as it is but a small fleeting and momentary look into the lifecycle of a Lynx and the very nature that surrounds it. The game clocks in at no considerable length above one or two hours, but those who try it, may very well find a provocative experience they can take away with them.","March 9, 2015","true","4.7"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","18","30","4","0"

It's repeatitive, yes, but I think that's what makes it so fun. The fact that we have to hunt the same things over and over again for our cubs, I think that, added with the art style, is what makes this game so unique, and why some people want to play it so badly.\nShelter 2 is a open-world survival game, it's meant to show what wild lynxes do everyday, and what happens if they make a bad decision. If a lynx decides not to look for food constantly, she runs the risk of starving to death. If a lynx decides not to find shelter from a thunderstorm, he runs the risk of being struck by lightning. If an animal doesn't run frpm danger, they'll be attacked, possibly killed.\nI think that someone would like to know what lynx mothers do, like to look for collectables, care for children until they grow old enough to care for themselves, or just want to sit down and play a beautiful game for a while, would enjoy this game.","November 2, 2015","true","70.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Also this review is mostly spoiler free.  Some gameplay features are talked about and that's it.  Hopefully this guide will help you.\n\nShelter 2 puts you back into the wild!  Scavenging and hunting for yourself... and your four babies.  This time you play the role of a mother Lynx.  Because of this change it puts a new spin on the main game; you are no longer so helpless when out exploring the world.  This causes you to have more free time to explore and scavenge.  But don't get too cocky!  Because if you do you'll surely be taken by surprise.\n\nThe world of Shelter 2 is much more open!  Its split into 3 distinctly different zones  (that are all connected through simple loading zones).  There are collectibles everywhere!  Seasons are also a major part of the game now.  Seasons change smoothly and in 'real time' (meaning you can see the landscape change in front of your eyes).  With the different seasons comes different benefits and struggles.  Because of this you need to watch when and where you are at all times.\n\nMight and Delight have improved a lot on the basic, but fun, concept of the original Shelter.  So without further delay here is my Pro's and Con's list:\n\nPro's:\nBigger, better, more open world to explore,\nMore animal types to hunt and be hunted by,\nFun action gameplay that comes with being a mother Lynx,\nBetter looking than ever!  The graphics are crisp and beautiful,\nNo more forced stealth sections (go stealthy only if you want to)!  Play the way you want to,\nMore replayability.\nBut unfortunately Shelter 2 did take some steps backwards.  They tried to keep the game a mysterious learning experience and while a lot of aspects worked this way some areas of the game suffered because of it.  Because some mechanics such as (nothing too major here but just in case)  hibernation	,  natural disasters	,  the starving and stamina progression	, meaningless collectibles (looks like resources at first), and the few predators are not well explained it can lead to some frustration.  The menus take a bit too long to fade in and out for my taste too.  But all of this is obsolete in the later play playthroughs.\n\nAlso because of the fact you are a 'predator' now your biggest adversary is hunger.  So the survival aspects, of the first game, are mostly obsolete after a bit of practice hunting some prey.  Depending on what you enjoyed the most this could be a good or bad thing.  On one hand it now free's up time and worry to focus on exploring and collecting.  But on the other hand it cuts out a lot of the animal vs animal survival.\n\nCon's:\nSome aspects of the game are not well explained,\nPretty short (2-3 hours) game, (although some may say the collectibles and replayability make up for it)\nLackluster collectibles,\nSlow menus,\nFloaty camera,\nLess animal vs animal contact.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed my time with Shelter 2!  It improved a lot of things from the first game while still feeling fresh.  And even though I wish it had more animal higher up on the food chain it delivers a great experience.  If your looking for a relaxed, fresh, experience then Shelter 2 is the game for you!\n\nIf you're interested in a let's play you can check out mine:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUExeeGBYLLhpOlqMr-XjQWzbcZ2Cybjz\n\nI will update this review as I spend more time with the game.  I'll also cover any updates or changes.\n\nIf you have any suggestions or questions about this review please let me know.","March 10, 2015","true","4.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

This game is a slow pace game and some people might not like that about this game but, it is a great game and you should try. One thing always feed your cubs it will help them evolve and prevent them from dying. The plus is when they get bigger you don’t have to hunt as much because they will start getting their own food.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/recommended/275100/","daytondoes","Dayton Does ¯\_( ͡°Ꮂ ͡°)_/¯","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/","1247 products in account","There are plenty of video game heroes that have multiple installments, and still have yet to utter a single word. Shelter 2 is the spiritual successor to the wildy popular Shelter. Shelter 2 presents a mother lynx and her four kittens. Your job is to help the kittens grow up into independent killing machines. The game world is far more expansive, and with your long kitty legs and carnivorous tendencies, you can run down rabbits and deer in a way that mama badger could never dream of. To add to the immersion, a stamina bar has also been implemented. This means you must sometimes choose between feeding your pups, or consuming the catch for yourself in hopes that you might be able to run down more. Unfortunately I made the mistake of naming my kittens… I grew quite attached to each one of them. So much so that when one finally keeled over from starvation during an especially harsh winter, I didn’t have the heart to go on. I abandoned the remaining three kittens as I hurled myself into a lake. Why is Shelter 2 so good? I shall attempt to explain.\n\nIn addition to the harsh calls the stamina bar forces you to make whenever you catch prey, there is also a new smell system for hunting food, and keeping track of the kids that will run off in any direction at the first sign of nourishment. Right-clicking will turn any nearby prey animals a bright red, making it easy to mark your target from a great distance. Catching your target is another story. As you walk toward a prey animal, you will automatically assume a crouched pose that allows you to sneak up as close as possible. This is particularly necessary for deer, as they run only slightly slower than mama lynx. Rabbits will be the main sustenance, and are relatively easy to catch even without sneaking. They do make sharp turns however, similar to how an actual rabbit would run when trying to escape a predator. Sometimes they will escape, and while your stamina will partially recover, the true victims of your failure will be the children. It’s always the children. Overall, Shelter 2’s hunting/hunger systems create a fantastic game of cat and mouse.\n\nOn top of all the gameplay improvements from the original, Shelter 2 offers a more avant-garde aesthetic. Fur used to look like hair, but this time it looks more like strokes from an oil paintbrush. There are patterns in the trees and on the ground that don’t look natural, however they won’t break immersion either. They simply serve to give the game its own unique style, which was arguably something that Shelter lacked. There is now also a growth mechanic which I don’t believe I ever noticed in the original. After a set amount of time or meals, your kittens will grow into lanky adolescent cats. Enjoy this stage, as it will be the last time you’re able to spend with them before you abandon whoever was strong enough to survive this far. This game WILL rip your heart out, but to have a game be able to move me almost to tears speaks volumes. Eventually you might play through again as one of your offspring, only to be reminded that nature, while beautiful, does not give one damn about cries of mercy, as she breaks your heart once more.\n\nOverall Shelter 2 is an outright winner in my book, however I did find a couple blemishes. The controls feel a bit stiff and don’t really lend themselves to any sort of delicate work, such as picking up the right kitten from a pile of four. The difficulty is relatively low, and you will need to implement your own set of rules in order to really get that gripping survival feel. The music is acoustic guitar, which suits better than the electric guitar in Shelter, but it still tends to drop out seemingly at random. Finally the map takes a lot of getting used to, you will find yourself lost in this big wide world quite a bit, but at least you aren’t alone. The potential for this series is unmatched, and I can think of 100 animals I’d like to see a Shelter game for. Can you imagine raising baby flamingos? Teaching them to dip their head in the water and eat krill? Or to fly awkwardly with their legs dangling down like some sort of paraplegic? Then stopping by a river for a quick drink and an alligator snatching one away. I want to see it. Please take my money!! If I had to make a list of Greenlight games proving that it’s a working system, Shelter would be right at the top. Thanks so much to Might and Delight for sharing this game with the world.\n\nGameplay:\n\nControls- 6/10\nFun Factor- 8/10\nDifficulty- 5/10\nReplayability- 8/10\nInnovation- 10/10\n\nAesthetic:\n\nGraphics- 9/10\nMusic- 6/10\nSound FX- 7/10\nStory/Lore- 9/10\nLevel Design- 6/10\n\nFinal Score: 82/100 for innovation, gameplay, and graphics.\n\nSummary: Immersive and beautiful wildcat simulator.

The number of different preys is pretty low and hunting mostly consist of running and try to "hit" them before you lost sight of them because it's super hard to notice little prey with those graphics (yay, graphics are not helping). Sometimes you do the same and press "space" as well.

But, like any game, there are also pros/cons to it. I'll get onto those, after a brief intro to the game.\nYou spawn as a Lynx, running from wolves, you're pregnant and are soon expectant of giving birth, it's Winter. You run, eventually jumping onto a cliff, which somehow the wolves can't follow you, and you escape to a secluded tree on a slight hill. For some reason this tree also has a cave and you give birth to 4 cubs, congratulations! You also get to name them, from here on out, you will face trials and turmoils as you raise the children.\n\nPros ::\n+ Naming of cubs\n+ Disasters\n+ Seasonal change\n+ (Mostly) Open World\n+ Kits can die\n+ Many types of prey to hunt\n+ The game is beautifully made\n+ Lots of detail\n+ I feel like I'm actually a mother\n+ Survival mode\n+ You can get rid of the tutorial\n\n\nCons ::\n- No change to kits. (EX: Always 4 kits, always same coat pattern/color)\n- You can hunt. That's it.\n- Stamina bar is hard to see during Winter\n- Disasters always seem to strike at the same time\n- (Glitch?) Sometimes kits while in their larger stage of growth, after just feeding them, will immediately fall down\n- Never been attacked by wolves, super rare\n- More prey/predators should be added\n- No real change to your surrondings, you always stay in one aways-same-generated area\n- You aren't required to eat/drink, you basically fast the whole game\n- Snow rabbits/brown rabbits blending into the ground, making them unseeable, plus it hurts the eyes\n- No prey spawns during disasters so if your kit goes down, oh well\n- Not being able to skip the end scene\n\n\nMOUNTAINS ::\n\nMountains is the newest DLC for Shelter 2, it's very new actually, in fact it needs a lot of work, below will be a list of pros/cons of this dlc.\n\nPros ::\n- Graphics are still good\n- New environment\n- New predators\n- New prey\n- Owls??? What are they for nobody knows\n\nCons ::\n- Extremely glitchy\n- Even after pouncing on an eagle it stole my baby\n- Fox AI is bad\n- ALL prey has disappeared? Game mechanic?\n- Fire is scary\n\nI'll update this some more when I think of more pros/cons to this game, despite the bad, this is still a highly recommended game as it does have replayability despite the nonchanging stuff, if you like to feel immersed in a game I'd highly recommend it.","July 24, 2015","true","11.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The night grows darker and darker when a pack of wolves catch their sent and start chasing them, The mother starts running away from the wolves, desperate for an escape, when she comes upon a large hill. She leaps up, nearly jumping too low, reaching the top and escaping the hungry wolves. The lynx seems to be guided by the stars as she finds an abandoned den, allowing her to rest and kit. In the morning, the kits have opened their eyes and are ready to eat meat. The mother goes out and hunts two rabbits, bringing them back to the little ones. The lynx children are getting stronger, and are now ready to roam the wild with their mother. The mother hunts many hares, mice, and frogs. Every now and then they come across a fallen bird nest, allowing for them all to get their fill. After the mother started having trouble getting prey in the land near her den, she found a fallen tree and took her cubs across where they found a fair amount of prey. After the prey seemed to vanish, the family goes into a rocky tunnel, and without realising it, one of the kits start to starve, just as the wolves came. The wolves surrounded the mother and her remaining children on a hill until the night faded away, when the mother realised she had left one behind. She immediately kills a rabbit and charges towards the cave where the young lynx was slowly dying, but the mother had made it just in time and fed her child. They continued on until they went under an arch, on the other side they found deer. The mother hunted a deer and they all had a feast. After the feast, they found a surplus of food in the area. They hunted everything they found, but they took haste much too quick. Another child started to get extremely hungry after the prey had all either been hunted or ran away. The mother searched and searched until she found a small family of rabbits. She got one for her kit and came back as soon as possible. The kit finally got his food, but the others hadn't eaten, so another started to starve. The mother tried and tried, until finally she got 2 mice and fed it to the poor scrap. Time had begun to pass as the former kits were now half their mothers size and could hunt for themselves. They found enough food to keep everyone well until they became adults. When they were full grown children, their mother was old and weary. At fall, the mother had to leave. Mother lynx headed toward the den they hadn't visited since her now full grown kits were little specks. The mother went in the den as it had started raining, and had a final rest. She awoke to another realm, and headed in the direction we had started in. She went far, until she finally met her mate in the soul plane, reconnecting and watching over their kids."\n\nTL;DR - My babies nearly starved but I saved them then I died when they grew up. 10/10 game, would die from sadness again","December 16, 2015","true","2.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

But, like any game, there are also pros/cons to it. I'll get onto those, after a brief intro to the game.\nYou spawn as a Lynx, running from wolves, you're pregnant and are soon expectant of giving birth, it's Winter. You run, eventually jumping onto a cliff, which somehow the wolves can't follow you, and you escape to a secluded tree on a slight hill. For some reason this tree also has a cave and you give birth to 4 cubs, congratulations! You also get to name them, from here on out, you will face trials and turmoils as you raise the children.\n\nPros ::\n+ Naming of cubs\n+ Disasters\n+ Seasonal change\n+ (Mostly) Open World\n+ Kits can die\n+ Many types of prey to hunt\n+ The game is beautifully made\n+ Lots of detail\n+ I feel like I'm actually a mother\n+ Survival mode\n+ You can get rid of the tutorial\n\n\nCons ::\n- No change to kits. (EX: Always 4 kits, always same coat pattern/color)\n- You can hunt. That's it.\n- Stamina bar is hard to see during Winter\n- Disasters always seem to strike at the same time\n- (Glitch?) Sometimes kits while in their larger stage of growth, after just feeding them, will immediately fall down\n- Never been attacked by wolves, super rare\n- More prey/predators should be added\n- No real change to your surrondings, you always stay in one aways-same-generated area\n- You aren't required to eat/drink, you basically fast the whole game\n- Snow rabbits/brown rabbits blending into the ground, making them unseeable, plus it hurts the eyes\n- No prey spawns during disasters so if your kit goes down, oh well\n- Not being able to skip the end scene\n\n\nMOUNTAINS ::\n\nMountains is the newest DLC for Shelter 2, it's very new actually, in fact it needs a lot of work, below will be a list of pros/cons of this dlc.\n\nPros ::\n- Graphics are still good\n- New environment\n- New predators\n- New prey\n- Owls??? What are they for nobody knows\n\nCons ::\n- Extremely glitchy\n- Even after pouncing on an eagle it stole my baby\n- Fox AI is bad\n- ALL prey has disappeared? Game mechanic?\n- Fire is scary\n\nI'll update this some more when I think of more pros/cons to this game, despite the bad, this is still a highly recommended game as it does have replayability despite the nonchanging stuff, if you like to feel immersed in a game I'd highly recommend it.","July 24, 2015","true","11.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However in other regards, the games are quite different. Whilst Shelter in a fairly linear experience, Shelter 2 is an open world one, with more freedom to explore, and yet, I believe, less to discover.\n\nDuring my playthrough, the game felt arbitrary, and the objectives were poorly defined. Whereas the loss of a single cub in the original game felt like a real gut punch, in Shelter 2, I lost 2 cubs and I honestly have no idea how, leaving me more confused than anything else. Further, by going for an open world, Shelter 2 seems to have lost the variety of the first game, which includes many set pieces with different objectives and gameplay. Whilst I suspect the open world offers slightly more re-playability and a slightly longer play time, I don't think the time I spent in the game was of the quality of the first game.\n\nTherefore for most players, I would say that if the Shelter games appeal to you, I would recommend starting with the original rather than Shelter 2. That said, if you are looking for more of a simulation game than an experience, and you're willing to work through the obtuse instructions, you could give Shelter 2 a go.","May 28","false","2.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

I especially adore the graphics, really liking the style!\nThe game-mechanics are not that overwhelming, interaction with the environment (seems?) to be a bit limited, though - for me - that doesn't count too much.\n\nGameplayMaybe I'm yet a bit "thrown into the world with no clue what's goin' on" because I never played Shelter 1. I actually have no clue why 2 of the kittens died. They just seemed to be more weak than the other 2 and strolled more behind. But they not seemed to be underfed as they had plenty to eat (I spent *much* time hunting). Did the other 3 (2) bullied them and didn't let them eat? Did they eat something wrong? How can I stop them from dieing just like that?\nI definitely will try to figure out more after my exams, but I would appreciate it if somebody would just point me into the right direction.\nAh, yeah, don't expect too interesting dialogues ;-). Cats/Lynxes are high nobles, actually standing high over us primitive "humans" :D\n\nConcerning the Linux port:I know I have some "special" hardware (nVidia "Optimus" => integrated + dedicated GPU), which is not well supported by the manufacturers (neither on Windows nor on Linux...). With this setup I sometimes get some freezes and hangs but going into the menu and back solves it.\nI also faced a *strange* bug where I only could slide but not steer.

It is developed and published by (possibly) the greatest company in the world, Might and Delight (Shelter 1, Pid, and The Blue Flamingo). The engine is upgraded, the gameplay is more engaging, and the narrative is more coherent and emotional. Instead of playing as a Badger mother, you play as a Lynx mother in a different environment and scenario.  It's less linear than Shelter and boasts a fun and exciting open world. I love this game and I think you will too! (I'm extremely busy at the present moment so my analysis/ review is superficial, I apologize for that)\n\nPros-\n+Gorgeous art style (one of the greatest looking games I have ever played)\n+Weather effects and particle effects are AMAZING\n+Gorgeous world design\n+Amazing gameplay\n+Incredible soundtrack\n+So many collectibles\n+You can name your children which creates an emotional bond with them\n+The seasons play a huge role in progression and art style\n+A family tree that branches off with many offspring\n+Phenomenal ending that's not about death but about life, creation, joy, and freedom\nPons-\n+/- Gameplay is fun and addicting but is overall basic and in some areas, superficial\n+/- Short, but doesn't outstay it's welcome\nCons-\n-Camera controls are wierd and the camera is hard to control\n\nFinal Thoughts/ Verdict:\nShelter 2 is an amazing game! It's art style and basic premise make for a highly enjoyable audiovisual masterpiece! It's breathtaking visuals, beautiful soundtrack, and the incredible design of the way the game works and the weather/ seasons are beautifully crafted thanks to the brilliance and ingenuity of Might and Delight! I completely recommend it to anyone really, just don't expect the longest of games or really deep gameplay! 100% recommend!!!\n\n**Shelter 2 was provided for review by Might and Delight!

In the first game we played as a mother badger who tried to protect her cubs while trying to feed them and make sure they weren't eaten. In Shelter 2 the roles are reversed and this time we play as the predator. We play as mother lynx who tries to teach and prepare her own cubs for the wild. The sequel is a bigger game then the first one. In the first one we had a path and we followed it to the end but this time the world is open and you explore it how you want but there are dangers around and you need to be careful that you're cubs don't get eaten. The art style is amazing and it looks even better in 2 than it looked in the first one and it really shows that a lot of work went into this game. This game is also depressing because you feel attached to the cubs and when you lose them it hits you right in the feels. But of course there is some problems with the game that i hope the developers will fix. There are a few bugs like rabbits running through rocks and sometimes disappear into the ground. Some texture pop ins but nothing too major. The sequel is one amazing experience that everyone should play through at least once. Tons of replay value, art work that will leave you breathless, amazing survival mechanics. I give Shelter 2 a 9/10","March 30, 2015","true","1.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

So, when I read Shelter 2 description, I bought it immediately. Personally, I do not regret, the Shelter series have a huge potencial and I really want to support this project.\n\nBut, the game can offer nothing to a regular player. You face total lack of content, repetitive gameplay and poor difficulty. The game has very specific auditory: people who love felines, who love nature and wildlife, and would like to try to live their life.\n\nComparing to other Survival games, Shelter 2 is not a survival game in the matter of gameplay. it is more like a "hunting-hares-and-running-simulator-ish". There are only few dangers that you can easily avoid during gameplay. Not hard at all. Just kill a hare, feed cubs and you are safe. There is absolutely no need to hunt deer or something else big. The Devs failed to bring us the feeling of THE REAL WILDLIFE, hard, cruel and bloody. Where you fight for you life every second and can not even sleep peacefully. Where you fight for food because there are always lack of food and other predators, who want to take your prey. The game just does not has enough depth.\n\nThe lack of difficulty, lack of content and simple, repetitive gameplay made me to not recommend this game.","March 13, 2015","false","4.3"," 40 of 77 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","40","77","0","0"

I think the camera angle was quite bad and the ability to adjust it wasn't much of an ability. I would like to be able to see out of the Lynx's eyes for example.

Probably 1 of my favorite games.

I made sure all my kittens were fed. I was very careful.\n\nAfter 4 long seasons, the kittens had grown up! Hunting and eating on their own, I was happy and proud. Little did I know the sadness that came in only 2-3 seasons.\n\nIt started with the 'message'. I knew what would happen, but this started to worry me. What if my kittens didn't make it? I had to make sure none died.\n\nAs fall broke out, I was walking across the hills, after spotting a rabbit herd. Then I realized.. there were no kittens near me. I looked behind myself to see my kittens- but they were frozen. I was thinking that this couldn't be it. But it sure was, and they all ran off in seperate directions, leaving me in the cold Autumn rain.\n\nI sulked to the den and woke up in pitch dark to find a trail of stars. I followed it to my mate(I assume). And the game ended.\n\nThat was truly a beautiful experience. Now, Shelter 2 IS repeatitive. It's just hunting food and keeping your kittens away from danger.

I'll buy its DLC.\nOthers said about the positive parts of the game so I don't want to repeat them.\nI recommend it if you like survival, atmospheric, artistic and relaxing game :)","February 10","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't. So randomly by chance I found this one while looking for survival sandbox games. I didn't look at anything apart from a couple of pictures and decided what do i have to lose other than the odd 10$ on sale.\n\nStory : You an endangered Lynx, repopulate the world or die trying. Make sure to eat an eagle along the way.\n\nGraphics are amazing. Everything looks like it was taken right out of a childrens book with Next gen draw distance and effects, The gameplay is just as good if not better. Being a lynx in this is like the real deal. Truly Fun 10/10\n\nCons : Fire, flooding, eagles stealing your babies, wolves stealing your babies, getting lost, starving (has not happened on my watch yet but im dreading the day it happens)\n\nBottom line is that I would pay full price for Shelter 2 and DLC again if I had to. Stalking deer and eating the very eagle that tried to steal my cubs got a 10/10 and i have yet to finish or even get close to making my Lynx family tree larger.","January 2","true","102.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am still very much new to the game but the open-world design is a great experience so when things happen (like a mudslide) it feels very organic. I can imagine the audience for this game is small, but for those who like it they'll love it. My main gripes is the lack of direction as to what to do exactly (But, to its credit, that is point and things are rather intuitive) and the slightly-wonky camera controls (there's no real excuse for this)","March 11, 2015","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I read the words "Bears and Birds of Prey" and it sold it to me.\n\nI am now 5hrs into the game and I can say it has 200% improved the feel of the game. There is a sense of danger at every turn... I now patrol around my kittens when they feed after having them swooped away by Eagles or stolen by Foxes. I have yet to encounter the bears properly as when I see them I run to the hills screaming.

I'm critical because I care.\n\nTL;DR: Leaves a fair amount to be desired, but is still quite satisfying if you enjoy nature, art, and getting attatched to virtual lynxes.\n\nI appreciate the open environment (as opposed to the linear setting of Shelter 1) but I think it could have been executed better.  There's no explanation for the symbols representing the different places, no incentive to go there, and the worst part (for me) is that if I've put in the effort to explore far away, then I've got to walk all the way back to see the end of the game, putting me off from wanting to explore in a future playthrough.  It didn't feel like there was really all that much to DO, either, and the collectables feel especially pointless.  The game still has its fair share of bugs too.  It's frustrating when my cubs start refusing food for no reason, and I once had trouble crossing the lake because every cub but one was stuck in the ground.  Shelter 1 just felt more satsifying somehow, even though there weren't as many options.  I liked being able to pick the cubs up, but didn't really find a use apart from moving dying ones to a slightly better location, which was hardly ever needed.  Now this last complaint isn't really so much of a flaw in the game as much as a pet peeve.  I thought maybe Shelter, of all games, would get this right, and I was a bit disappointed when I found that it didn't.  Listen.  As far as I can remember, wolves do not bark and howl while trying to kill something (neither do bears, tigers, etc!).  All of these animals make noise for a lot of reasons, but it doesn't really make sense to do so then, eh?  But maybe I'm wrong.  It's been a while.\n\nAnyway.  The pros: Killing deer was quite fun, and every time I entered a new environment I had to pause to take in its beauty.  I enjoyed seeing the animals move so realistically, just like I've seen so many real cats move.  I loved the changing of the seasons.  The in-pain and dying sounds the cubs make are appropriately heart-wrenching, and I was legitimately sad whenever I lost one (RIP Carver, David, SP, and Skye).  The soundtrack was quite nice as well, and I do want to say that I'm (SPOILERS) very happy to have a happy ending this time.  I want to reiterate: This game is beautiful.\n\n6/10","March 11, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

An okay-ish game.\nVery little replayability.\n\nWhile every part of the game side feels great, both gameplay wise and emotionally, the transitions between each stage are quite jagged and the overall arch is ....meh.... When your cubs age they simply become easier to feed. Thats unfortunately how many are seeing it.\n\nDen to tag along, you dont need to carry the food back.\nTag alongs to teens, you dont need to actually hunt. Just sprint, they grab anything they cross, which is a hell of a lot.\nTeens to adult, they leave and you dont need to feed them.\n\nThen you do it again with one of your cubs. EXACTLY THE SAME WAY! They even name themselves the same thing.\nThe same "Cut scenes" play and it is just as unthreatening. Never lost a cub because I never got attacked.\n\nIt has 5 levels\n1. Learn the controls and run in a line. Map change then run in a line.\n2. hunt and carry it back to den.\n3. hunt twice and drop it.\n4. hunt (if you want) or just run around they feed themselves.\n5. go home then run in a line and play in a field.\n\nThe three hunting parts actually blend into one. Thats both good and bad. It just means its 3 levels.....\n\nThen once thats done and you want to continue a family then you need to watch all the damn tutorials again. Meh to that.\n\nI think this really could have gone somewhere if they treated it a bit more like a game than a bedtime story. It really should have been about 3 times longer. More shielding the cubs in the den then more of protecting the cubs while you hunt for them.\nThen some form of teaching mechanic. They sit to watch but they already killed several things before they could have learned....\nA dangerous environment would also help. The worst I found was fog. . . Thats it. It didnt even do anything.\n\nHaving a pack hunt would have been cool too. I managed to get 2 deer from one herd, they could have gotten at least another one together. Make me feel like I actually taught them something rather than them picking up lucky kills as we run through grass trying to transition maps.\n\nI understand that a lot of things are hidden at first glance but they really need to show them.\n\nApparently the cubs have slight infighting if they get too alpha and beta. I never saw of that.\nApparently there are wolves that hunt the cubs. I never saw that.\nApparently it is hard to survive in the wild. I never saw that.\nApparently there are eggs in trees, I never saw that.\nApparently there are frogs. I never saw that. I even visited a swamp.\nApparently there is danger for the cubs. I never saw that. But I did see jesus kitties walking on swamp water.\n\nThey made a good, hard, narrow, game with Shelter 1. They made a good, open, story with shelter 2 . They hopefully will make a good open game and a good story with Shelter 3. (They really should make shelter 3.)\n\n\nTL:DR\nIts short, sweet, fun and gory with zero replayability unless you like searching for needles in stacks of needles that are all painted the same camoflage. Also jesus kittens.\nBuy it for half price when they make Shelter 3.\n","March 10, 2015","true","1.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

Considering you get to name them, different coat patterns would be wonderful!\n\nNote: This game takes the same storytelling style and artistic bend as Shelter, but it's not a chapter by chapter sort of story, more than it is an open world 'explore and appreciate' kind of game.\n\nFor me, though, it's one of my favorite games.

I think for $15 it's a bit pricey, (maybe worth $10?) The reason I think so is because it's just a repeat of the first game, (survival of babies goes first) but has no story. It's a free roam game where you wonder a few world areas for food types.\n\nIt's cuter than the original, the graphics are better, and the music.\nThe seasons change, and it does actually tell you what to DO in the game, and how to feed babies.\nThe only issue I had was toward the end while waiting for seasons to change I was literally just catching rabbit after rabbit and nothing else was going on, I was bored, craaving the end.\n\nThe ending music was pretty, it was nice in mood, and I will be starting on my second generation soon.\nThe coats of the babies are randomly generated I believe so they can look like the mom, or vary greatly.","March 28","true","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The art is amazing, and the music gives is what gives you the emotional feels. I have to say it's a short game and I could play through one family in one sitting in about one/half an hour, but it never gets old. I haven't played the original Shelter game or Paws, but I'm keeping my eye on them for when they go on sale. And again, the art is very unique which makes gameplay even more majestic. I had to get the mountain pack to see more of the art in the game. I'm sure I'll be playing it alot more.\n\nThough, I'm not sure what the story line is besides keeping your cubs alive. If there was more of a story line it would be even better. I'm excited to play Paws and the original Shelter game, I heard they're a bit harder than Shelter 2.\n\nSince it's different experiences almost every time you raise your cubs, it never loses the fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mishigosa/recommended/275100/","mishigosa","goat mom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mishigosa/","166 products in account","This is currently more of a 'first impression' review, but I will say from my small amount of time playing that this game isn't for everyone.\n\nIf you enjoyed the original Shelter because you liked the pressure of trying to keep your cubs alive despite the threat of predators, environmental dangers, and the ever looming threat of starvation, you will possibly not enjoy Shelter 2. Because Shelter 2 is not that sort of game, it is very much an open world sandbox.\n\nThere aren't any levels that you are guided along through; the 'zones' are open, and really the only things to motivate you to roam around are to look for collectibles and for a change of scenery. The areas do change depending on the season, but the seasons seem to flit by so quickly that it can be a bit disorientating; one minute the ground is covered in deep snow, the next everything is green again. Some zones also seem to be more difficult than others to survive in; some have less game to hunt and can result in starvation of your cubs. But these areas are also entirely optional to go to unless you are really into getting all of the collectibles.\n\nHaving to protect your young is still a thing-- sort of. They can die from predators, though it doesn't seem like wolves are especially common; some people have reported not running into them in a playthrough at all outside of the initial tutorial level, and at most, twice. They can also of course die of starvation, which is a different ordeal than it was in the original Shelter. Hunting is what will get you enough food to feed your cubs, though there do seem to be some ground items you can eat (I think one I came across was bird eggs? frog spawn? something?), you will mostly be chasing rabbits, frogs, and deer.\n\nHowever, one thing to keep in mind is that in this game you do not feel nearly as 'helpless' as you may have in Shelter 1, which I feel detracts from the feeling of being connected with the cubs you are taking care of. Sure this game does add the cute feature of being able to name your precious fuzzy kittens, but these babies have fangs and claws that they will eventually start to use on their own, as after they have grown a bit they will even start hunting small game on their own. And because you spend the whole game essentially killing everything in sight except for the big bad wolves. you don't feel nearly as helpless as a parent. There is no looming threat of a swooping eagle in the sky, and wolves can be run away from without too much difficulty, if they even bother to show up in your playthrough.\n\nThere are also just some technical problems that can be annoying. When you get close to prey your lynx crouches down, and there will be a little jarring 'alarm' sound along with a marker over the prey's head if it starts to suspect you are there. However this crouch isn't at all controllable and just feels really pointless and awkward, the sound and notification is unreliable and hard to hear/see, and you will just end up accidentally startling your prey into running off anyway. So you just spend most of your time just sprinting at your prey and hoping you will get a kill off on it. Most prey of course moves faster than you do in a straight line, so you have to try to maneuver around to get them. This can be incredibly annoying, as the controls are not really especially receptive, and you will often end up making turns that are too wide and either running circles around your prey and never getting close enough to kill it until it eventually just despawns, or getting disoriented and confused and just giving up on the chase.\n\nThe game's art style, while incredibly beautiful, can also be a pain in the butt. Small prey and even your cubs can be incredibly hard to see as they just blend in with the texture of the ground. And while the game does offer a special 'lynx vision' that shows prey in red that you can activate by right clicking, this special vision can only be activated while you are standing still, and is useless when you are actually trying to track and chase something.\n\nSo would I recommend this game? It's hard to say really, and I wish their was a 'Maybe' button to click instead of just a Yes or a No. I personally think I will play it again in the future and give it some more time, but I am the sort of person that finds 'walking simulator' games like Eidolon to be soothing, and tends to like casual artsy games.\n\nSo I suppose will say that if you want to get this because you enjoyed how the levels in Shelter 1 presented some bit of challenge and tension, you will not find that in this game, and you will not enjoy it. If you just want to settle in, name some kittens, and wander around some pretty scenery looking for things while killing rabbits for a while, you might enjoy this quite a bit. If you're on the fence about it, I would wait until it inevitably goes on sale at some point in the future, even if it is a year or so down the line. You aren't really missing out much by not getting it while it is brand new.","March 10, 2015","false","0.5"," 38 of 76 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","38","76","2","3"

It is rather incomplete, glitchy and short game where they make you pay for the rest of the content via the mountain DLC. If main game gets more content it should become worth full price.\nLong version pasted below and pros below that.\n\nThe maps are not large and "expansive", there's only 3.\nThere's not many natural disasters and they're not very dangerous (I let the mudslide go over me, nothing happened no kittens lost. At minimum it should knock you out and take a kitten)\nNight time is NOT dangerous, not hiding at night seems to have no problems - I've not once had to take shelter nadda zilch there is no mandatory reason to take shelter unless you're talking about jumping onto a rock for the single wolf attack\nThere's no fires like shelter 1 even though there are fire textures in the game files\nThe wolves are only in one map and they're not very dangerous - you jump on a rock and they go away...or they steal your deer kill and go away and that's the only time you'll see them.\nThere's not really any other dangers in game\nThe much talked about jumping is non-existent. There's very little jumping opportunities outside of tundra croppings to get away from wolves ("new jump features" sounded like I'd be able to jump things but all you can really jump on is the preset rock outcroppings. Nothing else, you'll just glitch off any other rock)\nThere's no climbing\nThere's not much variety in prey - rabbit, deer, bird, frog, ratthing\nYour mum is invincible - she doesn't need feeding or watering\nThe cubs don't actually need watering either\nThe biggest risk to their survival is me forgetting to feed them because I'm trying to take a picture of the tree textures,\nThere's no "raising or strengthening" of the cubs going on AT ALL - they just follow you around and you feed them, but how much or little you feed them doesn't change anything beyond dead or not,\n\nFor a game out of early access I keep getting the weirdest glitches like falling through the ground, or doing a headstand in spot or one amusing time I recorded with the video - on my back flipping back and forth back and forth back and forth.\n\nThe family bloodlines I've not really noticed any change in patternwise but they're slightly darker than the mum. That's it. The fancy family tree bloodlines and the only change is the saturation of the colour. If that's the only change, I don't see the point.\nSomething was mentioned about preferred patterns showing up more often but I've not seen anything\n\nOverall each generation is quite short and quickly grown up and gone before I really get attached to them. It's a promising beginning but overall the whole feel of the game is "unfinished" and "small".\n\ntl;dr If I had known all of this beforehand I wouldn't have paid full price for the game. There's not enough content to warrant it, the shortness of each generation prevents any emotional connection and the achievements cannot be completed due to the items spawning outside of the allowed locations.\n\nMaybe if the DLC was a free content pack, but as it is not - it's a pricey $7AU to add on to an even pricer $20AU game - not worth the money, get it on sale for $5-10 but not full price.\n\nI regret buying it and I wish I had known all of this so I could spend my money on something more satisfying. Heavily disappointed as it is a cute game with lovely textures, but it's not the survival-raising-cubs-family-tree-game that was advertised.\n\n:(\n\nPROS:\n\nThe design is great, it's artsy and has cute music. I love the textures and pattern designs, I wish there was an ingame zoom to properly admire the textures. The cubs and rabbits are cute, as are the deer.\nCollectables are VERY WELL HIDDEN dear lord. Also very cute caves here and there, I wish there were more caves and tunnels in the game. The weather system is very promising although I do wish you actually came to harm when a MUDSLIDE goes over you.\nThe mods are very responsive to your questions and bug reports.\nI really like the sun going down and experiencing night time, but this is only in the tundra and not the other maps which is weird.\nThe deer migrate and alert each other.\nThe credit scene is gorgeous.\nCould use more skins though, only got 4 variations of each colour.\n\nWould love recommendation for more animal raising survival games that have content and replayability. As it is, this game is still lacking in quite a bit of content.\n\nMost of my hours is collectable hunting because I was determined to become the first, or one of the first, to get all achievements.

Shelter 2's story is just your cubs are born, feed them, grow up, leave. There was a point where a pack of wolves attacked and ate one of my babies, and I could do nothing about it. There are some areas with unique aspects, but overall a dull feeding frenzy for two hours. One thing that bugged me was that when you birth the kittens, you have a chance to name them. This isn't a concept that a Lynx mother understands. In Shelter, the babies are distinguished with stripes. If you happen to like how Shelter 2 is played, with a dynamic "story" and an open world, by all means.

However, it could have been much more. As it is you're tasked with raising 4 lynx kittens as super mommy lynx who has the ability to go ~9 months without any food at all, no need for drink, and resides in the land of endlessly respawning rabbits.\n\nI played survival mode out of the gate, I was worried a few times as my kittens fell over a few times starving...then another batch of rabbits spawn and back to easy mode. I expected the game to be much longer, having to catch a dozen rabbits a day for a couple days and eventually move onto bigger game as my little ones grew in both size and appetite. Maybe be set on by other predators maybe a bear trying to steal my kills, or wolves trying to steal my kittens. Perhaps dealing with other dangers such as harsh weather, humans who want my pelt, a wild fire....anything really to make the game more entertaining than chasing rabbits around in circles. Sadly I am disappointed.\n\nRoughly 2 hours and about 100 rabbits later the game ends and I have the option of charging off to the ending cutscene or gathering collectables(ugh).\n\nNow that I'm done with my sad thoughts...\n- The game has great music\n- The art style fits, its not the priettest or the most breathtaking I've seen. but its good\n- After my kittens grew up I did go exploring and took down a deer, that was fun....and tasty\n\nNow I bought this game expecting either a great story like To the Moon and worth as much as a AAA title. Or excellent gameplay that would last 15-20 hours. (usually I rate gameplay based games as being worth ~$1 per hour)\n\nThe story of the game, while touching, doesn't make it worth what I payed for it in my opinion.\n\nI bought it at $7.49.

In the beginning when you're living through your first life the game is fun and exciting, but that quickly begins to wear off even with the progression of your initial storyline.\nMy reasons are as follows.\nThe game quickly looses my interest once the challenge of raising my cubs is gone, really all you're doing is hunting All the time and the only "story" progression is a little blip of text on the screen.\nWhile the startup of the game with the scripted wolf chase is occurring it's rather thrilling, it's telling a story, but that ambiance of excitement and the mystery of the guiding starlight really isn't present in the rest of the game. Not only that but if you run into wolves later on they don;t kill you, you get knocked out and then wake up as the wolves are leaving allowing you to just continue from where you were. There is no penalty of death, why don't the wolves kill me when I was passed out on the ground? It takes the wolf threat and throws it out the window.\nOverall there really isn't much to do, once your feline dies of age. You have the chance to play as one of your surviving cubs (all of which are female every time forever and are always the same four shades with each litter) then you do the same thing over again, the only difference being your colour.\nThat's it, that's the game.\nRaise cubs, cubs leave, and during the whole thing you're collecting animal parts and plants for some reason.\nWhile the game is very beatifully stylized and the first few moments are fun it's not a game I can recommend as it's really not much fun after the first playthrough and even then it only lasts through the first part.","March 16, 2015","false","2.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's the kind of game that makes me love indie developers. I haven't played Shelter, but I've always loved big cats (and the not so big!) so I thought I'd try it out.\n\nGraphicly it's nothing to shout about, low poly models and basic texturing. However, the games artistic approach is what sets it apart. Yeah it may not be Cry Engine 3 stuff, but that doesn't matter because it's patchwork style textures are really charming and I love them. Gameplay wise, it's a little repetitive and I feel that this is a real "marmite" game. Either you'll love it and have multiple playthroughs or you'll spend half an hour in it and then never play it again.\n\nThe core of the game is raising your cubs from newborns to adulthood. You need to hunt, provide food to avert starvation and protect them from predators (wolves in this case) and any environmental hazards however I've yet to really meet any. This is where the game seems to fall short sometimes. On my first play through, I lost one cub to wolves which appeared out of nowhere. Second playthrough I didn't see any wolves at all, but lost two cubs to starvation. I don't know what the triggers are but it seems like wolves don't appear enough. In Shelter although it was more liner there were instances where you had to protect your family from forest fires but there doesn't seem to be anything like that here. I can't help but feel there are missed opportunities to introduce some more depth to the game than simply catching prey and avoiding wolf packs. Perhaps a menu to view your cubs progress in detail, it's easy to forget their names since you can't seem to view them after the initial "birth scene" in the den.\n\nHowever, in the grand scheme of things these are relatively minor details. The core game is solid, and while there are some performance issues here and there I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs. It's a great game for the price (under a tenner!) and it actually works on release, unlike some of the multi million dollar releases *cough* AC: Unity *cough*.\n\nScores on my personal experience:\n\nGraphics: 4/5 - Lovely artistic style. Could do with slightly higher poly count and particle effects need optimising.\nMusic: 5/5 - Lovely music, really it's a perfect match for this gameplay style.\nGameplay 3.5/5 - Love it or hate it, solid core but could do with some added depth.\nValue 5/5 - Have spent far more for far inferior quality, excellent value for money!\n\nOverall, 4/5.\n\nFor the money you're spending, you owe it to yourself to at least try this game if for no other reason that to support a great indie developer who I'm sure we'll see even higher quality games from in the future!","March 10, 2015","true","14.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

As in what they really hunt, a range of cubs you can have, choosing a mate, picking out prey, and you didn't even have to feed yourself, which was really disappointing.\n-Predators of lynx and the cubs. The only 'predator' I saw was darkness (getting lost) and starvation.\n-The collectibles seemed really meaningless to me, i wanted to know what they were there for or if they did anything for my lynx, but I had no clue.\n-Throughout the game I was still learning new controls. No idea why they weren't shown to me in the first place... such as scratching a tree? I don't know what that was about but the game didn't show me until I was running around for 30-45 min looking for my den.\n-I had a cub die for no reason, it changed into a cut scene right after I hunted a deer, and when it came back and they were older one wasn't there.\n-I was wishing there was a way to see your cubs health throughout the game, it sucked not knowing who all were fed and who all needed to eat more.\n-I got extremely lost during the gameplay. I managed to travel and care for my cubs with only one death, but I ended up continuing to go in circles trying to find my way around, (the map didn't tell me which direction I was facing, nor did it tell me clearly where my den was).\n-I was excited to continue the game, as the same lynx, but found out it ended with her finding another mate? I was hoping you could have more cubs again, or maybe run into your previous cubs in their own territories, but suddenly the game was over.\n-I tried using the family tree, and I tried playing my black or really dark colored cub, I guess they all end up female? That was strange I was hoping you could play as a male too, but I wasn't too worried about that. Anyways I played as my dark color cub and it was brown when i entered... and the same thing that happened with the mother, happened to the cub. This was really disappointing as it's just the same thing over and over again, that's when i realized I probably wont bother playing again. The only real change is you may survive with more or less cubs, and you can change the cubs names.\n\nOverall I mean it was a great one time type of game. Play it through once and enjoy it. But to be perfectly honest, I feel like many who play this game will be wanting a lot more, and feeling that there was so much missing that could have made this a 10/10 game. Instead it's more of a 6/10 game, only because of the music and the amazing artwork. I enjoyed it, but feel it could have been so much better...\n\nMy score may be a NO... but to be perfectly honest it's more of a yes and no. If you're looking for a quick and simple game that you will enjoy this is fine. If you're hoping for something more in depth, you can learn from, and have somewhat of a challenge and story, continually fun and not repetitive..... this isn't it.","March 13, 2015","false","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You very briefly encounter predators, but the element of survival that sees you scraping teeth with life itself is the lack of (or the inability to catch) food.\n\nI was hoping for the game to be peaceful and calming, something to fit with the enviroment in all its glory, but was deeply disappointed with clunky controls, frustrating surivial tactics and of course the lack of direction. Just like the first one you're practically thrown into the game with only a few pictures to help guide you around, but this was so much harder to navigate around as it was very open world-based and there was no real objective.\n\nI would recommend this game if they manage to eventually fix bugs, etc. but as these problems outweigh the positive things, it's standing as it is.","March 17, 2015","false","2.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I guess thats the point, but I didn't find it very fun for very long. Plus, the audio often cut out for me randomly and I would have to reload the game to get it to play again.\nSpeaking of loading, I got stuck between a log and a rock and re-loaded my game to get out of it.

I have yet to play the first oneI was really looking forward to this game. I'm all about emotional storylines and unusual games. I read some good reviews and then a TON of negative reviews online and I went against my better judgment and gave the game a chance anyway.\n\nYes, the game is really cute. The art is nice, nothing out of this world. The storyline is endearing. But literally all I did for an hour and a half was run around and eat rabbits. The gameplay is clunky at best, I had several issues with the point of view camera controls. Besides walking, running, and jumping, none of the controls are ever explained in the game. I never understood the use of the "shelter" in the tree. I took myself and my cubs there when it rained and when it snowed and thought I may have to get some sleep then I realized I didn't know how. Then I realized I never had to sleep, apparently? The art is confusing, your cubs and the your prey blend in a little too well with the ground and the backdrops. The 6th sense function that highlights prey, your cubs, and general location is useful but confusing as well. The symbols featured in the function are never defined. My first round of the game had me wondering what the hell the big tree symbol was. I lost two cubs within the first 15 minutes randomly. There is an energy meter for you, the main character, but not for your cubs so I found myself paranoid constantly feeding them without ever knowing whether it would be enough. I constantly wished for a lynx call control or some sort of unique meow that would bring the pack together. Honestly 99% of the time I was pretty much just frustrated.\n\nI understand the premise of the game and what it was trying to achieve but this game just feels plainly undone and is flat out confusing. Definitely not worth $15...Maybe $5, and honestly at this point not even that. I appreciate the uniqueness of the game but I just feel ripped off at this point, I hope the gameplay is updated with some sort of goals or I don't know something. Don't get this, at least not at this point.","March 22, 2015","false","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is a touching game in a beautiful, open world full of content.\n\nYes, some are calling it repetitive. I don't think that, but if you want to that's fine! ^^\n\nShelter 2 is a wonderful game that puts you in the paws of a Lynx mother who births 4 cubs. You must hunt prey and avoid dangers in a breath-taking world with 3 places to visit (4 with mountains DLC.). You will see seasons change and hunt rabbit, deer, quail, frogs, and a little more. You can also find eggs. Predators like foxes, bears, hawks, and wolves pose a constant danger to your cubs.\n\nThis is such a fun game. Wonderful music, baby Lynx (I'm a feline lover. X3), a story of a courageous mother, and beautiful landscapes. The whole experience is such a beautiful thing and I honestly think this is one of the best games on Steam, probably the second best.\n\nI recommend this game so, so much and simply could not adore it more. I don't honestly mind if no Shelter 3 is released. This is great enough.\n\nPlay this game.

While it is clearly designed to be played repeatedly (create a family tree, tons of collectables) this doesn't change the fact that the actual story is exceedingly limited. 7/10\n\nDesign/Artistic:\nI adore the game's creative and somewhat abstract visual design. It makes both the animals as well as their surroundings look great while at the same time leaving something to the imagination. Very artistic and nice to look at. The soundtrack is beautiful too. It strongly conveys emotions (which often is a helpful or even the only clue to what is going on in the game) and at least for me never got boring to listen to. The creators clearly put a lot of effort into the artistic aspects of the game.\n\nGameplay:\nNavigation and controls are fine however the game lacks an introduction. Since I had already read about that before playing it I took a quick look at the menu to find out about the default controls. Obviously many of them could not be used before the game bothered to introduce them - it is somewhat questionable though that the keys for pausing or leaving the game also don't work in the beginning. After the "intro" they suddenly do work, without being introduced. This really only affects a couple minutes so it's hardly a major issue, I merely found it puzzling.\nA much more notable downside in the gameplay is the camera. In some of the more stressful situations (fleeing predators) I got stuck in trees and the like a few time with the camera angle preventing me from seeing how to get out. That was slightly annoying.\nThe other thing I'm not entirely happy with is the (lack of) introduction/explanation. Menus and explanation are very minimal, which in a way makes a lot of sense given that you're a lynx - but then again you are not, you just play one, for crying out loud! If I hadn't read a few reviews before playing I'm not sure I would have realized that you hunt just by tackling your prey face forward or that cubs are about to starve as soon as they lie down (= break down because they are so weak but that's just not apparent visually). On the upside: As soon as you've read this comment you know these things so they won't cause you any trouble.\n\nStory:\nThe idea behind the game is just as simple as it is sweet. You start as a pregnant lynx trying to survive (flee predators, find shelter) and spend the remainder of the game as a mother lynx trying to keep her cubs alive. You go through the seasons until the cubs grow up and leave to live their own lifes. You can then start the game all over with either of the surviving cubs and expand the family tree.\n\nTranslation:\nIf the German translation is any indication stick to English if possible. A few times it was bad to the point of me not understanding what it was supposed to say. I switched to English asap and was happy with that.\n\n\nOverall I do like the game but I'm glad I didn't buy it full price since that feels a little steep to me considering how short the game is.","May 26","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Just felt unfinished. There's so much more they could do with it, and I don't know why they haven't and just released it as a sort of 'bare-bones' even though this is a sequel.\n\nI didn't really get much satisfaction from it. By the time my cubs had either died or left, i had only encountered 2 herds of non-rabbit animals, so hunting was a bit of a non-event for me. One cub died without me even knowing - so my Lynx can sense a rabbit from 100 yards but not the illness and death of its own cub? This also limited the emotional impact of the 'death'. Also the map is impossible to understand so you have no idea where you are. The camera angle is shallow so you can't really look around very well, and there are loads of bugs - my game crashed loads of times and animals would jump all over the place.\n\nI'd love to see them really expand on the content of this game. How about training, learning new skills, increasing in strength, speed etc.\n\nI'm going to mark this as 'not recommended' as I don't think the quality or content is up to scratch. It feels like an early access game but is not marked as such. However, it is a novel concept and I'll probably play through again just in case I have better luck, and I'm sure plenty will enjoy it.","March 15, 2015","false","3.5"," 20 of 42 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","20","42","0","0"

I am controlling an agile Lynx, but the controls make it feel like Im driving a 30 ton, 10-axis truck. I died countless times trying to drink water, or trying to exit the lake border after drinking water (if you step into the water you die, for some bizarre reason)\n- The screen transitions are painfully slow\n- The interface tries to be minimalist, but it gives no clue on what to press on some occasions (for example when it shows you a new key combination)\n- The graphics are... weird. Some people may like them, I dont. Felt like I was playing 4D Boxing.\n- The map has some artificial blocked parts which are annoying. Like a very small rock that obviously you could jump above it, but it won't allow me to pass because it's marked internally as "impassable" or something.\n- There are no visual clues to know how hungry I am, or my cubs\n- I have no clue why I have won the game, I honestly tought I was almost losing it (all my cubs had died a while ago), then I changed to another part of the map, another lynx appeared (a male, I'd guess), then the credits started appearing (and the game crashed)\n\nTo sum it up, it feels like an incomplete game. Hopefully after some updates it will become good.\n\nAnd to be honest it was somewhat my bad also because after seeing some screenshots I thought it was a "Lion" (by Sanctuary Woods, 1995) remake so I had high hopes, but it's far from that.","March 14, 2015","false","1.5"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Let me first say that I DO like this game, but the things I dislike far outweigh the good. You start off running away from a pack of wolves to find shelter for a pregnant momma lynx. After that you name your cubs and are thrown into the world to hunt with mom and find them food. You start in a very open plains area with lots of rabbits, and there are 2 more areas on the map, a snowfield, and a forest. After I had caught enough rabbits in the area to feed my cubs, they left the den and then followed me around for the rest of the game. Here's where the game started to get less fun. Every time I would travel anywhere besides the area immediately around the den, the food got scarce, and very confusing encounters with wolves happen. After to travelling to both areas and losing 2 cubs because my lynx ran out of energy and couldnt run away fast enough, I decided that staying near the den was clearly the safer option, which was where I pretty much remained for the rest of the game.\n\nThere are a lot of things they could change about this game to make it more enjoyable, firstly make it easier to keep track of your pups without using the scent feature. I didnt care for the scent feature much at all as it only lasted 5 seconds. There was also a new feature if you press "c" in game that brings up some sort of graph with symbols of, plants and animals? I was told this keeps track of what you eat. What purpose it serves or why it is there I dont know, it's never explained in the game. Neither is anything else. In the first Shelter, the game is very linear, and I enjoyed that. You had a set path, and certain things to do to progress the storyline, and it was all very clear. In Shelter 2, they try to go for a more sandbox, open world exploration type feel, but it just doesnt work. I do not enjoy wandering around and exploring the pretty world when I'm constantly worrying where my pups are and are they gonna starve? A noble attempt at changing the formula of the game, but I hate to say it just didnt work.\n\nThis game might provide some enjoyment for some hardcore animal lovers, but I feel fans of the first Shelter will be let down.","March 17, 2015","false","1.1"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

It features amazing aethetics and a great sound track. The concept is interesting and the visuals are great, but is that enough for a fun game?\n\nThe visual design is something close to what you'll see in paper mache art. It's stylized and well conceptualized. It's a gorgeous game with a look that can inspire. The sound design is equally impressive. The SFX help immerse the player into the woodland environment and the music is very pleasant on the ears with it taking highs and lows as the situation requires it. From a purely aesthetic perspective, I have little to no complaints.\n\nWhen you jump into Shelter 2, you'll quickly discover it's not like most other survival games you've played, infact I wouldn't even call it a survival game. You don't have to feed yourself, theres no crafting, the only thing you have to be concerned about are your cubs. Chase rabbits and deer to keep them well fed and explore the landscape. It's pretty simple, maybe a little too simple. There's not really a huge amount of variety in the gameplay. You just run around catching prey and avoiding predators and other environmental dangers. You'll be doing this over and over again with out much else. It is fairly repetitive.\n\nThere's also no real mechanical punishment for losing a cub either. The game wants the player to feel emotionally connected to your family and tries it's best to have the impact of losing a baby as the punishment itself, but I feel like it fails in this. Let's take the games Brothers a tale of 2 sons, or This War of Mine as examples of games that successfully instilled emotional responses from the player. In both of those games, when you lose some one both those games will communicate sorrow through visual cues, the characters will cry, show signs or remorse, etc. You'll get a tiny bit of that in shelter 2 as well, but because none of the cubs show any personality traits that separate them, it diminishes any potential emotions from the player. Also the 2 games I named as examples amplifies the intended emotional response from the player through mechanics as well. In Brothers, you literally lose half of your controls, in This War of Mine characters become unresponsive to your commands. In Shelter 2 it does nothing. In fact, if you lose a cub, the game actually (intentionally or not) rewards the player from a mechanics perspective. You still have your full abilities and control, and the game gets easier as there's less mouths to feed. Games aren't movies or books. You can't drive home emotional responses from the player simply through narrative or visual cues. It needs to be reflected in the mechanics as well, and Shelter 2 falls flat on this.\n\nOverall Shelter 2 is a gorgeous looking and sounding game with an interesting concept. Unfortunately it seems to forget that it's still a game and it needs to be fun. With repetitive and uninspired gameplay, mechanics that fail to instill the intended emotions. At best, Shelter 2 is an interactive experimental art piece, at worst, it's a boring game with mechanics that are simpler than games you'll find on web browsers or mobile.\n\nPros:\n- Great looking aesthetics and sound design\n- Easy to pick up\n\nCons:\n- Fails as instilling the intended emotions\n- Extremely simple and repetitive gameplay\n- A far shot from being a "survival" game\n- limited content","March 23, 2015","false","5.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","1"

BEWARE FROM THIS POINT, THERE MAY BE SPOILERS...(not that there's much to spoil).\n\nFirst of all, the art is beautiful. Just like the first one, there's that sense of graphic repetition that takes you into another world. If only the gameplay was as beautiful.\n\nThere's a slight story here, sure. There's something about the end that I found satisfying. But to get to that point...It was, to put it blutnly, BORING. And it sucks to say this, because I ALWAYS want games like this to succeed. But it was boring, and there's really no excuse for it. What do you do? Hunt voles, rabbits, and deer. You can find the occasional eggs in an owl's tree. That's ALL YOU DO FOR THE WHOLE GAME. There's nothing complex to this at all.\n\n"But that's the beauty of it!" Some might argue. Well, not me. If you're going to add a feature like hunting, then at least make it interesting.\n\nWould I recommend this game, ACTUALLY? I don't know. It depends on what you want to see. Do you want to look at something pretty and enjoy about 20 minutes worth of gameplay? Because that's about all I enjoyed. The rest of it was tedious and all I playing for was to see the end and the art.\n\nAnyway, sorry I had to be so harsh...hopefully this kind of feedback helps them to make a better game. I was expecting more of a survival aspect, but really, surviving isn't that hard, and it kind of just confused me when my cub lay down and I didn't even know it was gone. So I lost one of them. And unlike the first game, where I OBSESSIVELY played the levels over and over again to make SURE all my babies survived (because I was connected to them)...in this game, I just didn't care.\n\nHope this helps in some way, and this is my two cents. Good luck on the next one :)","March 25, 2015","false","1.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

No predators attacking me or my cubs, never any real risk of starvation for them, and after you've killed a vole, a rabbit, and a deer... that's it. You're done. Repeat for two hours and you've seen all the game has to offer. I couldn't even manage more than a "meh" when my cubs finally grew up and ran off to do their own thing.\n\nThere are oodles of random collectibles, but who plays a nature simulator to collect flowers and sticks? There's a strange murky darkness you encounter on certain points of the map, and ominous music accompanying it, but nothing ever happened when I tried to explore that dark area. Other than raising your cubs through infancy and ending the game, there isn't even a need for "shelter", as those are the only two times you'll see your den. Then you breed again? No. Thank you, but no. I'm bored, and I'm done. Finish developing the game, and I might try it again.\n\nThis is very disappointing. The studio fumbled their way through development, tanked the brand they established with the first Shelter, and then charged CND $15.29 for what is essentially a tech demo.\n\nAside from the graphics, for all the bars that Shelter set, Shelter 2 failed to meet any of them, much less surpass them.

I had a tough time here, things seemed choppy when I was moving too fast, and the camera control feels loose.  Not promising.\nI hate long tutorials.  This one was only twenty seconds long.  It should have been longer.  There is not nearly enough information displayed in the game, and considering it has a little bit of narration at the start, there's no excuse for not including more english to explain the game mechanics early on.  Why did I stop running?  My character isn't acting any differently.  Oh I guess that must be a stamina gauge or something tucked into the corner.  Why did the game suddenly go into a loading screen and then I heard my kittens making noise from a mile away?  Who the hell knows, I don't and the game isn't telling me.  Also I don't see a manual.\nThe graphics are a distinctive artistic decision.  I like retro-ish graphics, I can get behind this modeling, the way trees move in the wind is interesting, I HATE the textures.  They are insanely distracting.  They look very specifically like when textures failed to load in games in the late 90s-early 00s and got garbage instead.  No thanks.  I'd prefer flat colors to this.\n\nI'm going to try getting into this later because the concept is 100% exactly what I want in a game right now, but it seems very frustrating.  I'm going to have to look up a gameplay guide online to have any fun here, and that's normally something I don't do.","March 15, 2015","false","1.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I don't see how I could have done better, and the game didn't give me much guidance, feedback, or warning that it was about to happen.  I quit out of the game.  I won't be coming back.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/275100/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","436 products in account","Shelter launched back in 2013 as something of an oddity, and an enjoyable one at that. Its left-field gameplay was equal parts art and heart-wrenching adventure, putting the player in the paws of a mother badger as she tried to keep her cubs safe. Inevitably, as the game progressed you were liable to lose some of your offspring to other hungry wildlife. Each loss struck like a deep wound to be carried through to the game’s dramatic conclusion, but while Shelter 2 is just as gorgeous as its predecessor, it fails to deliver the same meaningful impact.\n\n\nPlayers get a bump up from badgers, this time taking on the role of a slightly more fearsome Lynx mother with 4 cubs in tow. For all intents and purposes the gameplay is much the same as the first game, but there is one important, potentially fatal change this time around.\n\nMight and Delight have adopted an open world approach in lieu of the first game’s linear “A to B” levels, and while that system did feel a little constrictive at times, it becomes abundantly clear in Shelter 2 that it provided vital framing for the events throughout the game. Many titles can successfully pull off a lack of structure, but with very little to do other than feeding your cubs Shelter 2 is not one of them.\n\nThe emotions that the first game could evoke are dulled by comparison in the sequel. There’s no real feeling of helplessness, or that you are being hunted by powerful creatures. Might and Delight hand you the keys to the kingdom, and put you in control of a powerful animal to boot.\n\nIt’s difficult to feel a sense of urgency either. In the first game you played as an animal hardly known for its strength, even if badgers can be vicious little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Hunting enough prey to feed your young, as well as yourself, was a real challenge that could lead to beads of sweat forming on a furrowed brow when there was none to be found. You’ll rarely face such a challenge in Shelter 2. An abundance of wildlife litters each area, from skittish deer to randy rabbits, meaning you’ll always be able to provide for you and yours.\n\n\nA lack of the unexpected is Shelter 2‘s other main problem. It’s almost completely sedate and twee, right through to the conclusion. The first game threw hungry eagles, wildfires and starvation at you and your badger cubs, and an ending that could bring tear drops to a glass eyeball. I wouldn’t say that the developers have intentionally gone out of their way to make the game a sterile experience, but they have stripped away the aspects that made the first game so memorable.\n\nWriting about Shelter 2 is frustrating because it is technically superior its predecessor in almost every single way. The gorgeous patchwork art style from Shelter has been vastly improved, with new areas to feast your eyes on, controlling mother lynx feels weighty and satisfying, and retro Family’s soundtrack is absolutely stunning. But there’s something missing. A certain “je ne sais quoi” hasn’t made the transition over from the first game, which I suspect can be directly attributed to the shift from a linear gameplay approach to an open world setting.\n\nThe emotional power that Might and Delight held over players is no longer present in Shelter 2, making it a fun but ultimately forgettable sequel. It’s not a bad game, but it’s not Shelter either.","March 19, 2015","false","3.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Good games will at least tell you how to play them, while great games show you through natural examples. For the most part, this game has done neither.  While I've figured out that I can "catch" a rabbit by running into it, the game doesn't do anything to explain the finer points of hunting, and things like "sneaking" don't provide enough feedback to feel replicable. Did I sneak too close? Did the rabbit see me? (Do the rabbits have a "look" direction at all?)  Even though hunting seems to be a huge part of this game, I don't feel like the game is doing enough to show me how to improve.\n\nThe game also does a poor job of letting me know that a rabbit doesn't provide food for all four cubs. Especially because the rabbit carcass seems to leave behind some sort of "collectable" stone, which makes it look like there's still some rabbit left to eat.  Why does a lynx need "collectables" anyway? They were important enough for the developer to include them in the game, and looking at the keyboard settings helpfully informs me that I can press "C" to view them, but offers no sort of explaination about what they do, if anything.  Similarly, I learned that I can press "M" for "Memories," but the game gives no insight into what this means, if anything.\n\nI understand the allure of mysterious game mechanics that you figure out through trial and error, but that's only a viable method of teaching when the "errors" give the player feedback that helps them learn. What was I supposed to learn from the screen going into letterbox mode? It happened to me twice and I'm none the wiser for it, even though it was an extremely dramatic effect that seemed to be trying to communicate something.  Was I supposed to hunker down and hide when the light suddenly got dim? No idea! There's no visible feedback on the health of my cubs, so I'm still not sure if my actions kept them safe or just wasted time while they grew hungrier.  What about when the rain started? Should I have found shelter? Kept hunting? Do my cubs get cold and wet, or is this just an aesthetic effect?\n\nAll of this is made worse by the fact that eventually, your cubs get hungry and collapse. If I'm meant to learn through trial and error, having such a limited margin of error seems unfairly cruel.  It happened to me in the middle of the rainstorm, leaving me confused as to whether it was hunger or weather-related.  I tried to run down a few rabbits, but eventually quit out of the game in frustration, unsure of whether or not I was making the situation better by trying to bring them food, or worse by making my healthy cubs chase me around in the storm.  When I did finally catch something, I still couldn't tell whether or not the cub was actually eating it.\n\nI still really want to enjoy this game - it was an impulse purchase because the concept was so appealing to me - but without a way to understand the effects of my in-game actions, this is just an exercise in frustration.","March 10, 2015","false","0.8"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","1"

The game is astonishing with it's lush rabbits to feed and a few elk or deer to chase then it lacks the prolong story of it's cub and mother. You can finish this game in 2 hours which can be understandable seeing that will be repetitive if continued although Shelter 2 could have taken it to the next level and follow one of the cubs but once you have finish the story you are only given the option to replay what your first mother Lynx has done with the same wolfs scene chasing you which then as mentioned before is repetitive. Don't get me wrong even though I have thumbs down does not mean i don't recommend it it just means I saw a lot of potential in the Dev to make Shelter 2 a promising game with tremendous work into their 2nd project. This game is definitely for everyone and anyone who is curious to what happens in Shelter 2. There could be more possibilities in this with different approaches but it seems to be like a Dynasty Warrior series, this is my opinion on the game and with that i'll leave it to everyone on their own free choice.","March 9, 2015","false","2.6"," 30 of 88 people (34%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","34","30","88","6","7"

I am personally on my third generation, and I love seeing the combinations of patterns and colors I get with each new litter. Also, again on the visals, the art style is just tremendous.

Great game even if you haven't played the first one too.\n\nThis game has pawed its way into my recent top-ten faves list! It keeps all of the charms of the previous game, while improving on a lot of things that the first Shelter lacked.\n\nOne of the issues the first game suffered from was linear gameplay that did not offer much replayability. This is not the case with Shelter 2; It's a HUGE world, no set place to go. Even after multiple playthroughs there's still plenty of things I haven't discovered.\n\nYour goals are still simple and clear, and achieving those goals can always be a different experience (Some of my rabbit hunts end in bushes...). You're never quite sure where prey will spawn or how they'll evade you/detect you, and the hunt is always fun.\n\nAnother thing they really improved on with this game is indicating where (and who) your predators are, and how to escape them (mad respect for how they did their tutorial in this one). For the first Shelter, I get the whole "bottom of the food chain = less control" deal for the badgers, but losing babies to predators felt kind of punishing.\n\nAll in all, the Lynx was an excellent choice of animal to feature in this game. Playing at the middle of the food chain provides thematic support for a good amount of player agency while leaving enough danger in to keep players from getting bored.","April 6, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike games such as WolfQuest, where you had a built in compass so you could at least tell which way you were facing and where you were likely to end up, this one is just a few crosshatchings and weird symbols and only shows an extreme close up. Your little lynx character doesn't even match your direction, so the only way to know which way you're traveling is to check the map, go straight for a little while, and then check it again and compare the two. This isn't actually much of an issue when you're roaming around, but at the end of the game you're supposed to return to your den. Unfortunately, there's no way of finding it or even knowing which direction to travel in. Frustrating.\nThere's no variety in the cubs; you're stuck giving birth to a litter of one white, one black, one brown and one tawny. I can understand that playing as a male lynx would involve an entirely separate game, but the number of cubs and their colors could have been randomized.\n\nAND THE JUST PLAIN MISC\nIt would have been nice to have a popup saying, "Your cub Kir has just starved to death" or something along those lines. It's not hard to figure out when that happens but it would save me a trip back. The cubs do let out a yowl when they die, but if you're hunting, you tend to go quite far afield to find prey and you don't always hear them.\nAs your cubs grow older, they begin catching food for themselves.\nThe chase sequences are quite difficult on a touchpad, although certainly not impossible.\nThere are wolves in the beginning. However, I've never seen them anywhere else ingame.  The biggest threat to your cubs seems to be starvation.\nUnlike your cubs, you don't need to eat. On the one hand it makes the game much easier - it's hard enough feeding your cubs without having to stuff yourself as well - but it's also rather strange.\n\nI would recommend this game to those who like realistic, non-linear animal simulations.","March 15, 2015","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really do. It's a nice break from all of the other more serious games I play. My only real complaint is that it's very short and that there really isn't much to do. I also wish that your cubs names were a little more significant in some way so you COULD actually get attached to them. I forget the names every time until you get to the family tree section. I feel like this game could learn from wolfquest. The odd wolf attack, starvation, and a random black cloud that is never explained are not the only threats to a lynx. I never feel particularly threatened by anything by the second or third play though.\n\nI still like this game and play it when I need some down time. But for what I paid I don't feel like I'm getting my money's worth out of it. 16.99 or whatever isn't worth this. But I'm hoping that more updates will continue and bring more to this neat little world. The environments are awesome and fun to explore, the concept is there, and the music is beautiful.

I've played two runs so far, my first going surprisingly much better than my second.  It's a lot of fun to explore the open world, and I really feel the pressure in the winter to find food.  I lost a kitten on my second go when they were almost grown a poorly timed wolf escapade that starved him out.\n\nThe game isn't really complicated at all, and I hope future titles continue to advance whats here.  I know it isn't a super high up there game, and a lot of people knock it for that, but it's a beautiful, playable art piece that is fun in a way that you have to appreciate to enjoy.  It's more about exploration and balance than anything, and I get excited every time I find something new.\n\nIt won't be a title for everybody, especially the strictly "hardcore" gamers, but if you loved WolfQuest back in the day, exploring and survival, this will be a treat!\n\nAll in all, the style is great, the controls are very simple and easy to understand, and I think I need to buy the soundtrack now, too! :)\n\n\nQuick cons: I seem to have a glitch after the credits (which may be solved by redownloading it, I haven't seen anyone else with the same problem) that causes the main menu to spaz out and I have to force close the game with the manager.  Again, I have not seen anyone else with this issue.\n\nThe other thing is really just a nitpick, because I'm used to hitting 'esc' and going back to the game from any menu - maybe when in the map or collectables menu, make it so 'esc' returns you to the game rather than opens the pause menu?  I make this mistake all the time, and it's just a minor thing, but it would save from getting jarred from the game.","March 20, 2015","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No two playthroughs are ever the same, and i would strongly encourage exploration because there are hidden pathways between zones, waterfalls, secret passageways, collectables, and acheivements to unlock. If you stay in the starter zone out of fear of losing cubs, your going to have a boring time. Any surviving offspring can be played on your next playthrough which is a mini game in itself, allowing you to select various coat patterns and colors.\n\nPositives:\n-Charming Graphics.\n-Music perfectly sets the mood.\n-Kittens <3\n-Map style unique and charming.\n-Detailed enviornments\n-Randomly generated threats.\n-Collectables are well hidden.\n-All four seasons.\n-Biomes (Which can be exploited for easy food depending on the season.)\n-Weather (although it doesn't seem to affect anything besides frame rate)\n-Good replay value as long as you like collecting things.\n\n\nNegatives\n-Not enough randomly generated threats.\n-Not enough types of threats.\n-No risk of injury from hunting. (ect)\n-No increased difficulty mode for hardcore gamers\n-No day and night cycle.  (Night is a randomly generated threat)\n-Food / water / energy is all one simplified resource\n-Its possible to never feed your mother Lynx. Breaks emersion.\n\nWhile the game is small, the three main zones are incredibly detailed and it does provide an excellent proof of concept for the studio. An open world animal survival simulator is viable, however this IS their first attempt. Go into this game knowing the difficulty level will be set to LOW.... Probably to appeal to a wider audience. As of right now there is no way to increase the challenge. The developers have listened to feedback and now enable us to skip intro / ending scenes when we continue with the family tree.\n\nIts interesting to see how the first shelter had absolutly no player freedom, and now things have swung to the opposite side, where players have too much freedom and some do not do well without being told where they "need" to go.\n\nPick this up if you like to explore with kittens and make your own way through a world without anyone telling you what you should do.\n\nMy Personal Wishlist:\n\n-Hardcore Mode Added: Food / Water / Energy Bars\n-Healthy and Injured player status:\n-Risk of being kicked and injured by deer.\n-Enemy encounters / ability to Hiss / fight them off.\n-Injured state reduces overall available energy for 24 hours.\n-Day and night cycle added.\n-At "minimum" 3 days and 3 nights per "season" to extend the games time span.\n-Food sources only respawns at the start of each season (forcing players move between zones)\n\nMore threats:\nSPRING:  Fog Clouds reduce visibility when hunting.\nSPRING: Rivers move rapidly, creating intermitent waves. Drink from safer sources.\nSPRING: Bridges near rivers may become more dangerious to pass due to the waves.\nSUMMER:  Lightning strikes (producing fires, and mostly just scaring nearby cubs)\nSUMMER:  Forest Fires & and the blobby smoke clouds near them to reduce visbility / choke cubs.\nSUMMER:  Increased overall drain on thirst meter.\nFALL: Rabbit population disapears after dusk. Repears at dawn.\nFALL: Voles, and deer remain active through the night as a food source.\nFALL: Black Bears appear near wooded areas and streams.\nWINTER: Some water sources freeze over.\nWINTER: Longer Night Cycle. Only deer, at night and preditors.\nWINTER: Blizzards ruin visbility, reduce energy levels in order to keep warm.","March 22, 2015","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That is, I have reared one litter of linx cubs into adulthood and they have left to start their own lives, leaving me to the solitude of my own den. But at the same time that is only the beginning of the game, as you can choose to start anew playing as one of the cubs that have made it into adulthood.\n\nA few things:\n\nThe game is pretty intuitive. Left shift lets you run, and right click allows you to sense for nearby prey. Left click can either call your cubs to you, drop a prey item from your mouth, or carry your cubs. Lastly, the spacebar allows you to jump onto nearby ledges, or onto deer you're hunting.\n\nCubs can become starved over time. When you first call your cubs to your side, they sound like happy, playful kittens. As they become hungry they will cry in pain and eventually stop moving. When this happens you will need to either move your cubs to the food or bring the food to them. I lost a cub somewhat early on because I didn't realize one had gone to the point of starvation and I had lost sight of it. That's right, while you can track prey you cannot track where you cubs may have fallen. Sure, there are icons that appear over their heads when you're "sensing" and they're near, but as soon as you've moved too far away... In hindsight, I should have realized. The cubs grow and shrink slightly in size dependant on how full they are, be sure to keep that in mind.\n\nThe prey you will be tracking will consist of marmots (gophers), rabbits, and deer. Rabbits are the most abundant in the game, and usually occur in groups of 2-3. They can only feed two of your brood, yourself included. Marmots dash around occasionally, but tend to hide into little holes that they dig. They can only feed one of your group. Deer are more rare, but when successfully taken down will feed your entire family.\n\nThere are two main phases of the game; when your cubs are young, and when they are adolescents. When your cubs are young they are 100% dependant on you to hunt for food. In the second phase, they will catch items of opprotunity. Meaning, if a gopher is nearby they will snag and eat it, the same goes for passing rabbits. It's rare, but it can happen.","March 16, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Any surviving offspring can be played on your next playthrough which is a mini game in itself, allowing you to select various coat patterns and colors.\n\nPositives:\n-Charming Graphics.\n-Music perfectly sets the mood.\n-Kittens <3\n-Map style unique and charming.\n-Detailed enviornments\n-Randomly generated threats.\n-Collectables are well hidden.\n-All four seasons.\n-Biomes (Which can be exploited for easy food depending on the season.)\n-Weather (although it doesn't seem to affect anything besides frame rate)\n-Good replay value as long as you like collecting things.\n\n\nNegatives\n-Not enough randomly generated threats.\n-Not enough types of threats.\n-No risk of injury from hunting. (ect)\n-No increased difficulty mode for hardcore gamers\n-No day and night cycle.  (Night is a randomly generated threat)\n-Food / water / energy is all one simplified resource\n-Its possible to never feed your mother Lynx. Breaks emersion.\n\nWhile the game is small, the three main zones are incredibly detailed and it does provide an excellent proof of concept for the studio. An open world animal survival simulator is viable, however this IS their first attempt. Go into this game knowing the difficulty level will be set to LOW.... Probably to appeal to a wider audience. As of right now there is no way to increase the challenge. The developers have listened to feedback and now enable us to skip intro / ending scenes when we continue with the family tree.\n\nIts interesting to see how the first shelter had absolutly no player freedom, and now things have swung to the opposite side, where players have too much freedom and some do not do well without being told where they "need" to go.\n\nPick this up if you like to explore with kittens and make your own way through a world without anyone telling you what you should do.\n\nMy Personal Wishlist:\n\n-Hardcore Mode Added: Food / Water / Energy Bars\n-Healthy and Injured player status:\n-Risk of being kicked and injured by deer.\n-Enemy encounters / ability to Hiss / fight them off.\n-Injured state reduces overall available energy for 24 hours.\n-Day and night cycle added.\n-At "minimum" 3 days and 3 nights per "season" to extend the games time span.\n-Food sources only respawns at the start of each season (forcing players move between zones)\n\nMore threats:\nSPRING:  Fog Clouds reduce visibility when hunting.\nSPRING: Rivers move rapidly, creating intermitent waves. Drink from safer sources.\nSPRING: Bridges near rivers may become more dangerious to pass due to the waves.\nSUMMER:  Lightning strikes (producing fires, and mostly just scaring nearby cubs)\nSUMMER:  Forest Fires & and the blobby smoke clouds near them to reduce visbility / choke cubs.\nSUMMER:  Increased overall drain on thirst meter.\nFALL: Rabbit population disapears after dusk. Repears at dawn.\nFALL: Voles, and deer remain active through the night as a food source.\nFALL: Black Bears appear near wooded areas and streams.\nWINTER: Some water sources freeze over.\nWINTER: Longer Night Cycle. Only deer, at night and preditors.\nWINTER: Blizzards ruin visbility, reduce energy levels in order to keep warm.","March 22, 2015","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You start out running from dangerous predators and then find yourself giving birth to 4 beautiful Lynx cubs. Then, you travel the large world hunting for you and your cubs, and trying to protect them at all costs. A very beautiful game.\nI give it a 9/10\n\nThe only things I have to complain about is that the icons (the 3 trees and the snowflake) weren't explained, and I had no idea what the icons were when you pressed C. I got that the first one are # of bunnies caught, and the second one is deer, but the rest I'm not sure. Also, I would have more fun exploring the world if I didn't have to constantly catch bunnies (which by the way, were the things that kept my family alive besides the 2 deer I was able to hunt down), which usually led me backwards, since they can do a 180 in less than a second. Let's see, the only places I got to were the hills where your den is, the meadow behind it (until I got chased away with my cubs by some weird black wall), the snowy area and then the prairie place.\n\nThen, after I passed one of the levels, two of my cubs layed down on the ground, and one of them died. I had food, but I couldn't find my dying cub, since you can't use your Scent while you have food in your mouth. Then, when I heard the heart-piercing cry of my cub, I knew it was dead.\n\nAnd, the only food I could really find were the bunnies that skittered around in the plains, and occasionly one of my cubs would catch something that looks like a mouse. In my time, I couldn't catch a bird. Killing a deer was exhilirating, when you finally outsmart one and leap onto its back to sink your teeth into its neck. While it does feed your four cubs at once, they are extremely hard to catch since they run much faster than your Lynx Mama. In order for me to catch one, I had to be lucky, or I had to corner it somehow, like getting it to turn so I could leap onto it.\n\nI only had one nightfall, and I ended up on some small hill, and the wolves never found me, which is good, but having more night would have made it more challenging. Instead of being able to sit on a ledge and wait for them to pass, you might have to hide your babies somewhere and then run. It would also have been more enticing if you were able to kill the wolves, and while I understand that the wolves are in packs, it would have been pretty neat.\n\nOther than that, this game is really fun, even though you spend most of it hunting. Personally, I found it very exciting to chase the small animals like bunnies and frogs. When your babies grow up and become adults, they begin hunting on their own, and then you get the gray screen where it says that your now full-grown babies are going to start their life of solitude. I was so sad, I would wander away and use my command that calls my cubs to me, but they wouldn't come. I turned away, and when I turned back around, they were gone, leaving just me to wander aimlessly around the world. I give this game a 9/10, because I loved it, it could have had more, and I grew so attached to my baby Lynxes.","March 14, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay seems to consist of nothing but constant hunting and dangers are easily avoided by not venturing into the other areas. That really defeats the purpose.\n\nAlso the controls could really use some better joystick support.

By and large, I was pretty impressed (got two cubs to adulthood; the other two starved to death or something)\n\nTHE GOOD\nThe concept\nFree roaming. However, if you want a game that tells you what to do and what the next move should be, you probably won't like this one\nThe sensing for prey is a nice feature, but it doesn't always work; I've gone through parts thinking there's no prey only to have rabbits suddenly racing away from me\nDifferent prey, and different tactics.  It's not enough to bump into a deer; you need to actually jump on its back\nDifferent seasons and day and night\nThe ability to play a fresh game with one of your offspring\n\nTHE BAD\nThe map is very bad. Unlike games such as WolfQuest, where you had a built in compass so you could at least tell which way you were facing and where you were likely to end up, this one is just a few crosshatchings and weird symbols and only shows an extreme close up. Your little lynx character doesn't even match your direction, so the only way to know which way you're traveling is to check the map, go straight for a little while, and then check it again and compare the two. This isn't actually much of an issue when you're roaming around, but at the end of the game you're supposed to return to your den. Unfortunately, there's no way of finding it or even knowing which direction to travel in. Frustrating.\nThere's no variety in the cubs; you're stuck giving birth to a litter of one white, one black, one brown and one tawny. I can understand that playing as a male lynx would involve an entirely separate game, but the number of cubs and their colors could have been randomized.\n\nAND THE JUST PLAIN MISC\nIt would have been nice to have a popup saying, "Your cub Kir has just starved to death" or something along those lines. It's not hard to figure out when that happens but it would save me a trip back. The cubs do let out a yowl when they die, but if you're hunting, you tend to go quite far afield to find prey and you don't always hear them.\nAs your cubs grow older, they begin catching food for themselves.\nThe chase sequences are quite difficult on a touchpad, although certainly not impossible.\nThere are wolves in the beginning. However, I've never seen them anywhere else ingame.  The biggest threat to your cubs seems to be starvation.\nUnlike your cubs, you don't need to eat. On the one hand it makes the game much easier - it's hard enough feeding your cubs without having to stuff yourself as well - but it's also rather strange.\n\nI would recommend this game to those who like realistic, non-linear animal simulations.","March 15, 2015","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That is, I have reared one litter of linx cubs into adulthood and they have left to start their own lives, leaving me to the solitude of my own den. But at the same time that is only the beginning of the game, as you can choose to start anew playing as one of the cubs that have made it into adulthood.\n\nA few things:\n\nThe game is pretty intuitive. Left shift lets you run, and right click allows you to sense for nearby prey. Left click can either call your cubs to you, drop a prey item from your mouth, or carry your cubs. Lastly, the spacebar allows you to jump onto nearby ledges, or onto deer you're hunting.\n\nCubs can become starved over time. When you first call your cubs to your side, they sound like happy, playful kittens. As they become hungry they will cry in pain and eventually stop moving. When this happens you will need to either move your cubs to the food or bring the food to them. I lost a cub somewhat early on because I didn't realize one had gone to the point of starvation and I had lost sight of it. That's right, while you can track prey you cannot track where you cubs may have fallen. Sure, there are icons that appear over their heads when you're "sensing" and they're near, but as soon as you've moved too far away... In hindsight, I should have realized. The cubs grow and shrink slightly in size dependant on how full they are, be sure to keep that in mind.\n\nThe prey you will be tracking will consist of marmots (gophers), rabbits, and deer. Rabbits are the most abundant in the game, and usually occur in groups of 2-3. They can only feed two of your brood, yourself included. Marmots dash around occasionally, but tend to hide into little holes that they dig. They can only feed one of your group. Deer are more rare, but when successfully taken down will feed your entire family.\n\nThere are two main phases of the game; when your cubs are young, and when they are adolescents. When your cubs are young they are 100% dependant on you to hunt for food. In the second phase, they will catch items of opprotunity. Meaning, if a gopher is nearby they will snag and eat it, the same goes for passing rabbits. It's rare, but it can happen.","March 16, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Was hoping it was a more expanded and detailed verison of it but ended up falling a little bit short in the actual need for survival. Really wish there was a maybe button since I would recommed it to someone I know would enjoy what the game does offer.\n\nFor those  who simply want a game that they could play to wind down on, want an out of the box experince, and have a good time then this is it. If you're expecting a realistic reprisnation of how lynx's have to make it out in the wild and a sense of preditor vs prey, you're going to have a bad time. There's not many preditors and the only time I ran into wolves was when all my cubs left the nest and I was wondering the snow area.\n\nOverall, I like the game but it's got its kinkys that could have been worked on before release. Would give it a 6.5/10, it interesting but lacks the intensity that would keep me playing.","March 13, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The real problem is that when you use your night vision(I guess that's what it's called) it's pretty hard to spot out your prey.\n\nBut that's basicly the problems I noticed.

No two playthroughs are ever the same, and i would strongly encourage exploration because there are hidden pathways between zones, waterfalls, secret passageways, collectables, and acheivements to unlock. If you stay in the starter zone out of fear of losing cubs, your going to have a boring time. Any surviving offspring can be played on your next playthrough which is a mini game in itself, allowing you to select various coat patterns and colors.\n\nPositives:\n-Charming Graphics.\n-Music perfectly sets the mood.\n-Kittens <3\n-Map style unique and charming.\n-Detailed enviornments\n-Randomly generated threats.\n-Collectables are well hidden.\n-All four seasons.\n-Biomes (Which can be exploited for easy food depending on the season.)\n-Weather (although it doesn't seem to affect anything besides frame rate)\n-Good replay value as long as you like collecting things.\n\n\nNegatives\n-Not enough randomly generated threats.\n-Not enough types of threats.\n-No risk of injury from hunting. (ect)\n-No increased difficulty mode for hardcore gamers\n-No day and night cycle.  (Night is a randomly generated threat)\n-Food / water / energy is all one simplified resource\n-Its possible to never feed your mother Lynx. Breaks emersion.\n\nWhile the game is small, the three main zones are incredibly detailed and it does provide an excellent proof of concept for the studio. An open world animal survival simulator is viable, however this IS their first attempt. Go into this game knowing the difficulty level will be set to LOW.... Probably to appeal to a wider audience. As of right now there is no way to increase the challenge. The developers have listened to feedback and now enable us to skip intro / ending scenes when we continue with the family tree.\n\nIts interesting to see how the first shelter had absolutly no player freedom, and now things have swung to the opposite side, where players have too much freedom and some do not do well without being told where they "need" to go.\n\nPick this up if you like to explore with kittens and make your own way through a world without anyone telling you what you should do.\n\nMy Personal Wishlist:\n\n-Hardcore Mode Added: Food / Water / Energy Bars\n-Healthy and Injured player status:\n-Risk of being kicked and injured by deer.\n-Enemy encounters / ability to Hiss / fight them off.\n-Injured state reduces overall available energy for 24 hours.\n-Day and night cycle added.\n-At "minimum" 3 days and 3 nights per "season" to extend the games time span.\n-Food sources only respawns at the start of each season (forcing players move between zones)\n\nMore threats:\nSPRING:  Fog Clouds reduce visibility when hunting.\nSPRING: Rivers move rapidly, creating intermitent waves. Drink from safer sources.\nSPRING: Bridges near rivers may become more dangerious to pass due to the waves.\nSUMMER:  Lightning strikes (producing fires, and mostly just scaring nearby cubs)\nSUMMER:  Forest Fires & and the blobby smoke clouds near them to reduce visbility / choke cubs.\nSUMMER:  Increased overall drain on thirst meter.\nFALL: Rabbit population disapears after dusk. Repears at dawn.\nFALL: Voles, and deer remain active through the night as a food source.\nFALL: Black Bears appear near wooded areas and streams.\nWINTER: Some water sources freeze over.\nWINTER: Longer Night Cycle. Only deer, at night and preditors.\nWINTER: Blizzards ruin visbility, reduce energy levels in order to keep warm.","March 22, 2015","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The unique graphics (check screenshots, that is how it looks) is well combined with beautiful music and animation. The world looks good, and subject to seasonal changes that seem perfectly natural if you're do not watch them on purpose.\n\nSUMMARY: the game leaves a deep psychological imprint and is extremely immersive.

Great game even if you haven't played the first one too.\n\nThis game has pawed its way into my recent top-ten faves list! It keeps all of the charms of the previous game, while improving on a lot of things that the first Shelter lacked.\n\nOne of the issues the first game suffered from was linear gameplay that did not offer much replayability. This is not the case with Shelter 2; It's a HUGE world, no set place to go. Even after multiple playthroughs there's still plenty of things I haven't discovered.\n\nYour goals are still simple and clear, and achieving those goals can always be a different experience (Some of my rabbit hunts end in bushes...). You're never quite sure where prey will spawn or how they'll evade you/detect you, and the hunt is always fun.\n\nAnother thing they really improved on with this game is indicating where (and who) your predators are, and how to escape them (mad respect for how they did their tutorial in this one). For the first Shelter, I get the whole "bottom of the food chain = less control" deal for the badgers, but losing babies to predators felt kind of punishing.\n\nAll in all, the Lynx was an excellent choice of animal to feature in this game.

Shelter 2 is deeper than that, however.  It's a story about motherhood that, in an instant, can let loose a good punch to the feels that will leave you feeling like an emotional train wreck.  On the reverse side of the coin, however, you could find a story about a momma lynx that lets you find a deeper level of happiness than you've ever felt before as you watch you kittens turn into full grown adults.  It all depends on YOUR actions as a Mom.\n\nKeeping with the original Shelter, the developers have used the same stunning art style, with beautiful music that fits the theme of the game, and a loose storyline that helps to tie it all together.  The tactics you use to survive are similar to that of the original, as would be expected.\n\nThe first big difference from Shelter 1 -aside from the obvious species change- is that the gameplay has shifted from a linear progression through the levels, to a more open world, with many unique locations to explore and hunt.  Additionaly, weather and seasons are far more pronounced and aid the sense of time progression in this new world.\n\nThe other major difference is the way in which you must feed your babies.  In Shelter 1 you were an omnivorous badger, feeding largely on turnips and carrots, with the occasional frog, rodent, or even fox.  Essentially, alot of stationary sources of calories, with the occasional mobile meal.  In Shelter 2, however, you are a carnivorous lynx.  Gone are the days of walking up to a field of carrots and being set for life; now, you have to work for your food.\n\nWould I recommed this game?\n\n...\n\nIf you are the kind of person who enjoys games that poke at your soft, squishy emotions and, at times, take you from an enormous high, to a gut wrenching low, back to that euphoric high,  then yes, I would recommend it.","March 11, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm sure there is loads more to explore in the various landmasses that I haven't seen yet - I'm curious about the northernmost area but haven't seen much of it as it's hard to get there, and when I was there I was chased away by wolves! The soundtrack is gentle and appealing, and it gives great atmosphere as in Shelter 1. The graphics are more complicated than in 1, but retain the spirit of it. I haven't quite worked out whether there are distinct hunting techniques as in 1, but I have discovered a variety of food sources to feed myself and cubs with. I like being able to play the game with different lynx, but it would be nice to be able to return to previous individuals for repeat playthroughs or play with different littermates. It seems so far that you choose one cub per litter to continue the game with.\nIn brief, the pros are:\nGood graphics, music, sound effects, lots of areas to explore, fun gameplay.\nCons:\nThe 'story' itself could be longer (i.e. it would be good if it took a bit longer for the cubs to grow up), and I imagine it could get a bit repetitive the more times you play through.\nOverall, I would definitely recommend Shelter 2. It retains the spirit and emotional impact of Shelter 1 while expanding on gameplay. I look forward to seeing what else Might&Delight do with the concept and what they might add to Shelter 2 in the future! I will be returning to my lynx family as soon as my laptop cools down...\n\nEDIT 12.3.15\nI have now played for over 12 hours and I love this game even more. I have explored much more of the map but there is still more to see! I see different things wherever I go, and the environments change significantly from season to season. I thought I'd seen it all in one area, but then I went there in spring and was just in the right place to see ducks and swans with cygnets. I tried to catch them but fell in the stream instead! My lynx was not impressed. I've seen several different types of deer, loads of rabbits, wolves, birds, mice and frogs, and I'm pretty sure I stole some eggs from an owl in a tree. I have discovered that you don't have to go back to the den when you are prompted after your cubs leave home. I explored with my lynx Kirrim for over 5 game years and enjoyed every minute, even when Kirrim almost got eaten by wolves! I did experience some stuttering after 4 years or so, mainly in winter or near water and almost exclusively in the 'snowflake' area. Other than those brief occasions the game has performed perfectly at full graphics on my 2 year old laptop.\nAs I have played more I have noticed some similarities with WolfQuest, a wolf sim set in Yellowstone Park. The fatigue system and the 'sense' system are similar but not identical, and I think Shelter 2 implements them better. The AI problems and bugs that WolfQuest was plagued by are also absent in Shelter 2. If you enjoyed WolfQuest and wish it had been developed further, buy Shelter 2!","March 9, 2015","true","130.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The concept is great and the gameplay is good. The art is unique and beautiful in it's own way.\n\nThat said, it is a bit lacking. The gameplay seems to consist of nothing but constant hunting and dangers are easily avoided by not venturing into the other areas. That really defeats the purpose.\n\nAlso the controls could really use some better joystick support. The movement is just a toggle between walking or sprinting, and it would have been much more immersive if it took full advantage of analog for the movement.\n\nIt does not seem that it would take much effort to make the game absolutely amazing.

By and large, I was pretty impressed (got two cubs to adulthood; the other two starved to death or something)\n\nTHE GOOD\nThe concept\nFree roaming. However, if you want a game that tells you what to do and what the next move should be, you probably won't like this one\nThe sensing for prey is a nice feature, but it doesn't always work; I've gone through parts thinking there's no prey only to have rabbits suddenly racing away from me\nDifferent prey, and different tactics.  It's not enough to bump into a deer; you need to actually jump on its back\nDifferent seasons and day and night\nThe ability to play a fresh game with one of your offspring\n\nTHE BAD\nThe map is very bad. Unlike games such as WolfQuest, where you had a built in compass so you could at least tell which way you were facing and where you were likely to end up, this one is just a few crosshatchings and weird symbols and only shows an extreme close up. Your little lynx character doesn't even match your direction, so the only way to know which way you're traveling is to check the map, go straight for a little while, and then check it again and compare the two. This isn't actually much of an issue when you're roaming around, but at the end of the game you're supposed to return to your den. Unfortunately, there's no way of finding it or even knowing which direction to travel in. Frustrating.\nThere's no variety in the cubs; you're stuck giving birth to a litter of one white, one black, one brown and one tawny. I can understand that playing as a male lynx would involve an entirely separate game, but the number of cubs and their colors could have been randomized.\n\nAND THE JUST PLAIN MISC\nIt would have been nice to have a popup saying, "Your cub Kir has just starved to death" or something along those lines. It's not hard to figure out when that happens but it would save me a trip back. The cubs do let out a yowl when they die, but if you're hunting, you tend to go quite far afield to find prey and you don't always hear them.\nAs your cubs grow older, they begin catching food for themselves.\nThe chase sequences are quite difficult on a touchpad, although certainly not impossible.\nThere are wolves in the beginning. However, I've never seen them anywhere else ingame.  The biggest threat to your cubs seems to be starvation.\nUnlike your cubs, you don't need to eat. On the one hand it makes the game much easier - it's hard enough feeding your cubs without having to stuff yourself as well - but it's also rather strange.\n\nI would recommend this game to those who like realistic, non-linear animal simulations.","March 15, 2015","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That is, I have reared one litter of linx cubs into adulthood and they have left to start their own lives, leaving me to the solitude of my own den. But at the same time that is only the beginning of the game, as you can choose to start anew playing as one of the cubs that have made it into adulthood.\n\nA few things:\n\nThe game is pretty intuitive. Left shift lets you run, and right click allows you to sense for nearby prey. Left click can either call your cubs to you, drop a prey item from your mouth, or carry your cubs. Lastly, the spacebar allows you to jump onto nearby ledges, or onto deer you're hunting.\n\nCubs can become starved over time. When you first call your cubs to your side, they sound like happy, playful kittens. As they become hungry they will cry in pain and eventually stop moving. When this happens you will need to either move your cubs to the food or bring the food to them. I lost a cub somewhat early on because I didn't realize one had gone to the point of starvation and I had lost sight of it. That's right, while you can track prey you cannot track where you cubs may have fallen. Sure, there are icons that appear over their heads when you're "sensing" and they're near, but as soon as you've moved too far away... In hindsight, I should have realized. The cubs grow and shrink slightly in size dependant on how full they are, be sure to keep that in mind.\n\nThe prey you will be tracking will consist of marmots (gophers), rabbits, and deer. Rabbits are the most abundant in the game, and usually occur in groups of 2-3. They can only feed two of your brood, yourself included. Marmots dash around occasionally, but tend to hide into little holes that they dig. They can only feed one of your group. Deer are more rare, but when successfully taken down will feed your entire family.\n\nThere are two main phases of the game; when your cubs are young, and when they are adolescents. When your cubs are young they are 100% dependant on you to hunt for food. In the second phase, they will catch items of opprotunity. Meaning, if a gopher is nearby they will snag and eat it, the same goes for passing rabbits. It's rare, but it can happen.","March 16, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shelter 2 is deeper than that, however.  It's a story about motherhood that, in an instant, can let loose a good punch to the feels that will leave you feeling like an emotional train wreck.  On the reverse side of the coin, however, you could find a story about a momma lynx that lets you find a deeper level of happiness than you've ever felt before as you watch you kittens turn into full grown adults.  It all depends on YOUR actions as a Mom.\n\nKeeping with the original Shelter, the developers have used the same stunning art style, with beautiful music that fits the theme of the game, and a loose storyline that helps to tie it all together.  The tactics you use to survive are similar to that of the original, as would be expected.\n\nThe first big difference from Shelter 1 -aside from the obvious species change- is that the gameplay has shifted from a linear progression through the levels, to a more open world, with many unique locations to explore and hunt.  Additionaly, weather and seasons are far more pronounced and aid the sense of time progression in this new world.\n\nThe other major difference is the way in which you must feed your babies.  In Shelter 1 you were an omnivorous badger, feeding largely on turnips and carrots, with the occasional frog, rodent, or even fox.  Essentially, alot of stationary sources of calories, with the occasional mobile meal.  In Shelter 2, however, you are a carnivorous lynx.  Gone are the days of walking up to a field of carrots and being set for life; now, you have to work for your food.\n\nWould I recommed this game?\n\n...\n\nIf you are the kind of person who enjoys games that poke at your soft, squishy emotions and, at times, take you from an enormous high, to a gut wrenching low, back to that euphoric high,  then yes, I would recommend it.","March 11, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm sure there is loads more to explore in the various landmasses that I haven't seen yet - I'm curious about the northernmost area but haven't seen much of it as it's hard to get there, and when I was there I was chased away by wolves! The soundtrack is gentle and appealing, and it gives great atmosphere as in Shelter 1. The graphics are more complicated than in 1, but retain the spirit of it. I haven't quite worked out whether there are distinct hunting techniques as in 1, but I have discovered a variety of food sources to feed myself and cubs with. I like being able to play the game with different lynx, but it would be nice to be able to return to previous individuals for repeat playthroughs or play with different littermates. It seems so far that you choose one cub per litter to continue the game with.\nIn brief, the pros are:\nGood graphics, music, sound effects, lots of areas to explore, fun gameplay.\nCons:\nThe 'story' itself could be longer (i.e. it would be good if it took a bit longer for the cubs to grow up), and I imagine it could get a bit repetitive the more times you play through.\nOverall, I would definitely recommend Shelter 2. It retains the spirit and emotional impact of Shelter 1 while expanding on gameplay. I look forward to seeing what else Might&Delight do with the concept and what they might add to Shelter 2 in the future!

I have explored much more of the map but there is still more to see! I see different things wherever I go, and the environments change significantly from season to season.

My lynx was not impressed. I've seen several different types of deer, loads of rabbits, wolves, birds, mice and frogs, and I'm pretty sure I stole some eggs from an owl in a tree. I have discovered that you don't have to go back to the den when you are prompted after your cubs leave home. I explored with my lynx Kirrim for over 5 game years and enjoyed every minute, even when Kirrim almost got eaten by wolves! I did experience some stuttering after 4 years or so, mainly in winter or near water and almost exclusively in the 'snowflake' area. Other than those brief occasions the game has performed perfectly at full graphics on my 2 year old laptop.\nAs I have played more I have noticed some similarities with WolfQuest, a wolf sim set in Yellowstone Park. The fatigue system and the 'sense' system are similar but not identical, and I think Shelter 2 implements them better. The AI problems and bugs that WolfQuest was plagued by are also absent in Shelter 2. If you enjoyed WolfQuest and wish it had been developed further, buy Shelter 2!","March 9, 2015","true","130.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are some dangers that I have found in the game such as wolves and some moose as well as this darkness that kills you if you touch it, but it only comes out during the nighttime in the three tree area of the game.\n\nYou are basically raising kittens and then maybe later starting a story with one of your kitten it's your choice .\n\nIt is a little pricy for a game that doesn't give you much to work with, but I've put in some time and I've yet to explore everywhere in the world so I can't say how big it is.\n\nBeware the darkness it's super freaky and I didn't notice it my first playthrough (it just rises out of the large lake in the three trees area). It killed one of my cubs and when I got close too close for a minute I couldn't see.\n\nFor the wolves there are little platforms that the wolves don't jump up on (doesn't make much sense) but they can't follow up there so that is a way to avoid them.\n\nThis game is fun and relaxing for me.","March 13, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is not a game that u can find hours and hours of endless action in. It is more of a short story of being a mother in the wild.\n\nThe emotions the music brings to the everchanging seasons, weather and darkness is just amazing. The fact that there is nothing more than listening and watching your cubs to tell u if they are tired/hungry is great, brings out a natural survival mindset.. carry the slow and tired ones for a while.. listen to their cries, feed individual cubs as u need to.  Amazing game.\n\nWhen the music flows with the seasons and u are walking miles in search of bigger game and you realise a cub is missing.. You turn around in a frantic search for signs of life.. You can hear yelps from your cub but you are having a hard time locating it..the yelps stop..simply a sad moment and makes u bond to the ones you have still with you.\n\nThe group grows to a size to take down deer for a bigger feast..Eventually learning to hunt for their own meat, which leads them to go their own ways in the world.  Then, all alone you find yourself walking in the warm spring sun again.. in search of a mate to start all over and continue the family tree.\n\n!!!Play this as a short but emotional movie and you will very much enjoy this, be careful playing this as strictly a cat sim!!!\n\nEven though it is a great cat sim, most sims are boring for most people, so dont miss out on the story the devs put in place!","March 14, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did not expect anything because I already read it's very short but I have to say you really come to care about your offspring after a while. I finished it after 2 hours and then I saw that shelter 2 is out and it's about LYNXES. I'm a fan of big cats, and in general lynxes so I HAD to buy it. It's more about "teaching" your kittens how to hunt and don't let them starve.\n\nAltough there is not really much to "do" but hunting and collecting feathers, skulls ect (do you get anything by doing so?) you somehow build your own little story in your head, every playthrough is a bit different and I almost!! cried reading the credits at the end with that beautiful, beautiful music. I'm already in love with the soundtrack and the art, the colours are also very stunning. As an artist myself I have to say this game is very satisfying to play; the scenery, the movements, everything is placed so well in this little world.\n\nAfter my grown up lynxes left me I could barely stand the emptiness, I catched a few rabbits and got sad again after I realized there is no one here anymore who waits for me, meowing and complaining at me to feed them.

Simple premise, and it doesn't get much more complex besides a few random events that I think require more than one playthrough. This game is for people who enjoy ambience and reflection. Different areas of the map are designated by symbols. I don't believe it is necessary to visit each one, but they have their own feel and you can discover other environments and animals that aren't found in the starting area (deer, frogs, and bird nests.) There isn't much to hunting besides anticipating an animals movement and then getting close enough for the Lynx to grab them. The adventure element isn't a requirement, but if you aren't a curious person who enjoys exploring, then you probably shouldn't buy this game. In my humble opinion, additional objectives besides feeding your kittens only exist if you make them, and I think this game is meant to be instinctual, rather than cerebral. I would have preferred a longer game with more to do, but still thoroughly enjoyed my time with it. Also, great soundtrack.","March 10, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I JUST finished it, and I have to say it left me feeling and thinking about a few things.\n\nFirst off, it's a very quiet game. There's not a whole lot that goes on or a cohesive storyline. The game is about taking care of your cubs, watching them grow up, and that's it. There's a beautiful ending and little narration, but it gets the point across completely. I won't spoil it for you, but the ending is very open to interpatation. Which is something I like.\n\nQuite frankly, the game is very easy. What I enjoyed most about the game was the artwork. It reminded me a bit of paper mache and origami thrown together. The artwork is simply GORGEOUS and the map is huge. Really huge! I've only explored about half of it at this point. There is of course a hardmode, and once you finish the game you can actually continue playing as one of the cubs you've raised. You can even name them at the beginning of the game.\n\nAs I said before, if you're not a fan of quiet, artistic games. This may not be the game for you. It's very quiet. It's just the focus of a mother lynx trying to raise her babies. The soundtrack is relaxing, and quite frankly I could listen to it all day. It's that beautiful.\n\nIf I had to nitpick I would have to say I feel the game is way to expensive. While it is beautiful, I feel for the time you play it is not worth the price tag. I feel the game is more worth $5 rather than $15 like the price asks for. Still, overall a good game. If you want a nice experience and a quiet hour or two. This is a good game to try out.","December 12, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From start to finish, it is rather difficult to not get attached to your babies. The story of a mother lynx is seriously a tragic but really amazing one that makes you feel like you're actually there. The unusual appearance of the game adds a real special touch as well. The controls are simple and easy to use, yet there still is a challenge when hunting.\n\nOver all, there was nothing really bad, but i found a few glitches as i played. First, I discovered this one: I had played another full game, it was my 3rd gen to a new tree. Upon completing this game with 2 of my cubs I had found out when seeing my family tree that it seemed that none of my cubs survived, as i could not select any of them to start a new generation. It was disappointing mostly because i had to start a whole new family, but not the end of the world. Another problem i had found had to do with the mountain expansion. When you enter an area that is near the waterfall there are three ledges that you must jump up. For whatever reason, when my cubs became medium sized they could no longer get past the last ledge. They would just kinda run in place at the edge and wouldn't be able to follow me anywhere. (( Its kinda funny to look at, but it got a bit annoying. ))\n\nOverall, this game can be a tad bit buggy, but Shelter 2 is most certainly worth the money.","November 21, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, I wasn't completely let down, but it didn't come close to blowing me out of the water either. I honestly can't decide whether to give it a thumbs up or not because it has good aspects, but a lot of it is very stale and lacking in potential.\n\nThe art style is great and incredibly unique, I've never seen anything quite like it before. It manages to look very hand-painted despite being 3d rendered, and isn't so bizarre that its disorienting. The main selling point for this game is probably the art style.\n\nOn to less appreciable things: gameplay, potential, and overall opinion.\n\nI've got a beast of a computer, but I think this game is just coded in such a way that it begins to shoot itself in the foot after 15 minutes of playtime. Framerate goes right in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ regardless of graphics settings, and I had to close and reopen the game every so often just to be able to even play it. (Maybe something to do with the data endlessley compiling and not wiping itself when you leave an area and it becomes no longer relevant? Who knows.)\n\nIn between dealing with the game running like molasses for no discernible reason, I found myself struggling to rationalize a reason to play it beyond getting a few easy achievements. The point is simple: sniff, find a rabbit or whatever, run at it and hope the game doesn't lag so badly you can't catch it before your kittens starve. There's no direction- you just wander around and kill stuff over and over until your kittens grow up and start killing their own stuff, by which point you are mostly superfluous- and then they leave, and you go home. That's it.\n\nA few freak events make it kind of interesting, but its mostly just annoying because the fires and lightning strikes and floods are almost guaranteed to kill at least one kitten if you don't run like hell, and they look choppy as if they were thrown in last minute. I spent a good two minutes in a "flood" before I realized what it was supposed to be, I just thought the game was glitching at first.\n\nBasically, get this game only if it goes on a reeealllyy good sale and you don't have high expectations.","December 8, 2015","false","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't want to give it a "no" but I can't honestly give it a "yes" either. If there was ever a neutral option, this game would definitely be it.\n\nI've played the original Shelter and loved it. It was difficult, it was varied. The babies were hard to raise and I got ridiculously attached to them. The art style was gorgeous! Therefore, when Shelter 2 was announced, I got quite excited about it.\n\nUnfortunately, it feels like everything that made the original Shelter good is missing from Shelter 2. This time the game lets you free roam, and while this does give the game a much more expansive feeling, it also causes some of the situational charm of the original to be lost.\n\nI remember a section in the original where I was walking through a pitch-black forest with eerie predator noises echoing all around me, only able to see a few feet ahead. I was worried sick that something was going to leap out of the darkness and steal one of my babies if I took my eyes off them for just one second.\n\nThere is none of that tension in Shelter 2. I never felt under pressure to find food, as rabbits were consistently plentiful and a bit too easy to catch. There were also not as many predators. I got followed by a fox a few times, but each time I cornered and killed him within about 30 seconds.\n\nThe most tense moment I had was when some wolves appeared from nowhere. One chased me and knocked me down. The screen faded to black and when I woke up, one of my kittens was gone. It all happened too fast to be a tense moment, and I must admit, I didn't feel any sadness about the missing kit.\n\nOverall, I still think this series has potential. If you have not played either Shelter or Shelter 2, I would really suggest that you go and play the first one before deciding whether to purchase Shelter 2.\n\nPros:\n- The art style is absolutely gorgeous, as always.\n- Lovely, atmospheric soundtrack.\n- Controls feel very smooth.\n- Much more expansive world.\n\nCons:\n- Repetitive. Most of your time will be spent chasing rabbits.\n- The tutorial tips are a bit too minimal. They lack explanation and function in favour of looking stylish.\n- Too easy. Food is plentiful and I honestly didn't feel like my kits were at risk at any time.\n- No replay value. You can raise more cubs, but you'll still spend most of your time chasing rabbits.\n","December 29, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And in the end it is really sad\nHowever it's short and figuring out the mechanics is frustrating. When a cub was starting to die I felt less sadness and more frustration because if you don't play it correctly the cubs most certainly will be pining for your attention often.\n\nIf you can help it you should opt to play this game in a focused environment where you can 100% immerse and devote yourself to creating the world to suite you. If the game was longer, with more content, and better controls the replay value would up tremendously.\n\nAll in all, it's a roleplay game. If you can get it discount you should grab it.

Fun! Concept is simple enough, execution is quality. All of the models move and feel like an actual lynx, and the animals that populate the world all seem realistic and lively. The environment itself is sizeable as well, full of collectables for those of you with a touch of OCD, and the art direction, though not realistic, is a beautiful shade of stylization I thoroughly enjoyed. Frame-rate is smooth, and the game isn't particularly buggy.\n\nThe story here is a story of survival. It's a heartwarming story of parental pride and affection if you let it be, really. The game lets you name each of the four kittens at the start, which helps to bond you to them, and the adorable mews and mannerisms of the little lynx kittens bring them to life. Of course, it can also be an unforgiving tale of the circle of life and the inevitable death of all things cute and loveable. Like that one time when me and the kids were scavenging for food and some wolves came upon us. I tried fighting off this one wolf, only to get my ♥♥♥ kicked and watch as the pack stole away with one of my babies. Honestly, that was one of the worst feelings I have had in a long time from a game. Seriously. If your kittens survive though, you are able to continue the lineage of lynx-dom through one of them, and you can track your family tree, which is a neat little touch.\n\nThe main objective of the game is simple: keep everyone fed. Most kills will feed one or two kittens at a time; only nests of eggs or deer will be able to feed the whole family. You often have to chose between eating your kills yourself, which will boost your stamina for a time and allow you to hunt more effectively, or to give your kills to your children, who desperately need it. Later in their juvenille stage, the kittens will actually assist in hunting. It's a simple goal.\n\nALL THAT POSITIVE STUFF BEING SAID, there are some issues with the game. The most pressing would probably be the lack of actual threat in the game. Quite simply put, Mother Lynx cannot die. At all. The kittens can, of course, from starvation, abandonment, environmental hazards or predators, but once you learn where the predators actually spawn (and in normal mode it's only in one area), you'll probably never lose a kitten again. And there's only wolves, too, which is kind of boring after a while. Lynx kittens have to worry about swooping birds, crashing trees, cougars, coyotes or even other scary adult lynx...there's so much more that could be included in this game that I would love to see--a tracking mechanic for predators, weather impacts, more environmental hazards. I would've liked to have seen multiple species you could play as--sort of like Tokyo Jungle--the more you play the more capable creatures you can unlock. There is replayability value there, but it's just not enough.\n\nI should mention there is a Survival Mode, which is sort of like a step up from your normal difficulty. Stamina doesn't regen as fast or through all the same methods; food is more scarce and migratory, and predators are a bit more difficult to deal with as well. I really enjoyed what little taste I had of Survival Mode, but again, it fell very flat after a while.\n\nInevitably, the game feels very bare-bones as it is, which is unfortunate because what is there is really good. As they say, variety is the spice of life, and Shelter 2 could stand to see a bit more diversity in its core product. I would recommend buying it on sale and only if a quality game with a more artistic direction appeals to you. In the same way games like Shadow of the Colossus, Monster Hunter or the beloved Hatoful Boyfriend simply aren't for everyone (and that's okay), Shelter 2 isn't meant to appeal to a wide audience. What is there, though, is very touching and presented with quality and pride. If you have the money and are interested, pick it up. I hope you aren't disappointed.","June 21, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fun! Concept is simple enough, execution is quality. All of the models move and feel like an actual lynx, and the animals that populate the world all seem realistic and lively. The environment itself is sizeable as well, full of collectables for those of you with a touch of OCD, and the art direction, though not realistic, is a beautiful shade of stylization I thoroughly enjoyed. Frame-rate is smooth, and the game isn't particularly buggy.\n\nThe story here is a story of survival. It's a heartwarming story of parental pride and affection if you let it be, really. The game lets you name each of the four kittens at the start, which helps to bond you to them, and the adorable mews and mannerisms of the little lynx kittens bring them to life. Of course, it can also be an unforgiving tale of the circle of life and the inevitable death of all things cute and loveable. Like that one time when me and the kids were scavenging for food and some wolves came upon us. I tried fighting off this one wolf, only to get my ♥♥♥ kicked and watch as the pack stole away with one of my babies. Honestly, that was one of the worst feelings I have had in a long time from a game. Seriously. If your kittens survive though, you are able to continue the lineage of lynx-dom through one of them, and you can track your family tree, which is a neat little touch.\n\nThe main objective of the game is simple: keep everyone fed. Most kills will feed one or two kittens at a time; only nests of eggs or deer will be able to feed the whole family. You often have to chose between eating your kills yourself, which will boost your stamina for a time and allow you to hunt more effectively, or to give your kills to your children, who desperately need it. Later in their juvenille stage, the kittens will actually assist in hunting. It's a simple goal.\n\nALL THAT POSITIVE STUFF BEING SAID, there are some issues with the game. The most pressing would probably be the lack of actual threat in the game. Quite simply put, Mother Lynx cannot die. At all. The kittens can, of course, from starvation, abandonment, environmental hazards or predators, but once you learn where the predators actually spawn (and in normal mode it's only in one area), you'll probably never lose a kitten again. And there's only wolves, too, which is kind of boring after a while. Lynx kittens have to worry about swooping birds, crashing trees, cougars, coyotes or even other scary adult lynx...there's so much more that could be included in this game that I would love to see--a tracking mechanic for predators, weather impacts, more environmental hazards. I would've liked to have seen multiple species you could play as--sort of like Tokyo Jungle--the more you play the more capable creatures you can unlock. There is replayability value there, but it's just not enough.\n\nI should mention there is a Survival Mode, which is sort of like a step up from your normal difficulty. Stamina doesn't regen as fast or through all the same methods; food is more scarce and migratory, and predators are a bit more difficult to deal with as well. I really enjoyed what little taste I had of Survival Mode, but again, it fell very flat after a while.\n\nInevitably, the game feels very bare-bones as it is, which is unfortunate because what is there is really good. As they say, variety is the spice of life, and Shelter 2 could stand to see a bit more diversity in its core product. I would recommend buying it on sale and only if a quality game with a more artistic direction appeals to you. In the same way games like Shadow of the Colossus, Monster Hunter or the beloved Hatoful Boyfriend simply aren't for everyone (and that's okay), Shelter 2 isn't meant to appeal to a wide audience. What is there, though, is very touching and presented with quality and pride. If you have the money and are interested, pick it up. I hope you aren't disappointed.","June 21, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are simple and the game is to protect and care for your cubs. The instint as a parent kicks in right away as you have to feed your cubs which trumps your human reluctance to harm animals you need to hunt. The game looks allot better then the trailer when you put the graphics on high. My only gripe so far is that the game advertises full crontroller support but the controller only works on the menu not in game. On a side note I feel as if the game may be a bit too open ended in the sense that it is not always clear what you should be doing. A way to fix thius might be to add more dangers or include some kind of built-in intiution to let the player know they are on track. As much as I love the game and the concept which feels good I'd like there to be more urgency in the gameplay. I suppose that might ruin the explorative nature of the game tho but a good mix of the two would be ideal.","July 1, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I JUST finished it, and I have to say it left me feeling and thinking about a few things.\n\nFirst off, it's a very quiet game. There's not a whole lot that goes on or a cohesive storyline. The game is about taking care of your cubs, watching them grow up, and that's it. There's a beautiful ending and little narration, but it gets the point across completely. I won't spoil it for you, but the ending is very open to interpatation. Which is something I like.\n\nQuite frankly, the game is very easy. What I enjoyed most about the game was the artwork. It reminded me a bit of paper mache and origami thrown together. The artwork is simply GORGEOUS and the map is huge. Really huge! I've only explored about half of it at this point. There is of course a hardmode, and once you finish the game you can actually continue playing as one of the cubs you've raised. You can even name them at the beginning of the game.\n\nAs I said before, if you're not a fan of quiet, artistic games. This may not be the game for you. It's very quiet. It's just the focus of a mother lynx trying to raise her babies. The soundtrack is relaxing, and quite frankly I could listen to it all day. It's that beautiful.\n\nIf I had to nitpick I would have to say I feel the game is way to expensive. While it is beautiful, I feel for the time you play it is not worth the price tag. I feel the game is more worth $5 rather than $15 like the price asks for. Still, overall a good game. If you want a nice experience and a quiet hour or two. This is a good game to try out.","December 12, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this game, you play as a mother lynx.  You give birth to cubs, and you must feed them.  Throughout the game, you may face struggles with gathering food and keeping your cubs alive.  There are many new dangers your cubs can face in the new Mountains DLC, such as bears, foxes, hawks/eagles, and starvation.  Before the expansion, your only dangers were wolves and starvation.  There is also a survival mode, which makes prey scarce.\nTo play this game, you must have patience.  It takes an hour to two hours to fully grow your cubs up.  There is also no end to this game as you can have one of your offspring have cubs as well.  There is a family tree in the main menu that indicates this.\nOverall, the graphics of this game are gorgeous and it is a very beautiful game in it's self; the circle of life.

It is such a great game! Unlike Shelter its an open world game whereas with Shelter it was set in levels and you could not return to the previous area once it was completed. But the only problem is that it needs to be more dangerous cuz so far the only danger is: 1, Wolves (Which you can easily avoid) 2, Starvation. Both are easy to overcome.\nSo Might & Delight plz add more danger plus adventure in this game. Cuz then it'll be perfect.  Other than that its AWESOME! AND LYNXY! :3\n\nHope this helped!\n\nPS.

The controls are simple and the game is to protect and care for your cubs. The instint as a parent kicks in right away as you have to feed your cubs which trumps your human reluctance to harm animals you need to hunt. The game looks allot better then the trailer when you put the graphics on high. My only gripe so far is that the game advertises full crontroller support but the controller only works on the menu not in game. On a side note I feel as if the game may be a bit too open ended in the sense that it is not always clear what you should be doing. A way to fix thius might be to add more dangers or include some kind of built-in intiution to let the player know they are on track. As much as I love the game and the concept which feels good I'd like there to be more urgency in the gameplay. I suppose that might ruin the explorative nature of the game tho but a good mix of the two would be ideal.","July 1, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Machati/recommended/275100/","Machati","machatihasgame","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Machati/","7 products in account","A good game.\nWhile indeed repetitive and at other times feeling unrewarded for your exploration, the game is fun, immersive, emotional, unique, and beautiful. I got pleasure however just from seeing my new cubs and their pretty colors (although my last three litters have been clones of the past litters, so now I wonder if I imagined it x_x )\n\nThe game is difficult at first but I'd actually suggest never using normal mode if you really want the threat of cub-loss hanging over your shoulder.\n\nBy "Unrewarded for exploration" I mean that the beginning area is ultimately the best, biggest area for rabbits, mice, and minimal dangers (even with the expansion). Traveling across ice to places I hadn't touched or even going to the Mountains raised the chances of starvation up significantly. Maybe it was just my luck, but I've decided to only explore for the eye candy, not to look for the promised lands. You start in the promised lands.\n\n\nOne playthrough I think is worth your money, especially if you get it on a discount. However if you're like me and like to play games for hours and hours, you're either going to have to really like immersing yourself into the role of a lynx or make your own goals (or enjoy collecting things). Personally enforcing rules on yourself (like no mice), or aiming to catch as many rabbits as possible have been fine enough goals to keep me going. I love animals, so I'm happy to continue playing.","December 27, 2015","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Comboing/recommended/275100/","Comboing","Sgt. Bash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Comboing/","78 products in account","Before I start, let me be clear that it was very hard to give this game a "no" recommendation. I don't want to give it a "no" but I can't honestly give it a "yes" either. If there was ever a neutral option, this game would definitely be it.\n\nI've played the original Shelter and loved it. It was difficult, it was varied. The babies were hard to raise and I got ridiculously attached to them. The art style was gorgeous! Therefore, when Shelter 2 was announced, I got quite excited about it.\n\nUnfortunately, it feels like everything that made the original Shelter good is missing from Shelter 2. This time the game lets you free roam, and while this does give the game a much more expansive feeling, it also causes some of the situational charm of the original to be lost.\n\nI remember a section in the original where I was walking through a pitch-black forest with eerie predator noises echoing all around me, only able to see a few feet ahead. I was worried sick that something was going to leap out of the darkness and steal one of my babies if I took my eyes off them for just one second.\n\nThere is none of that tension in Shelter 2. I never felt under pressure to find food, as rabbits were consistently plentiful and a bit too easy to catch. There were also not as many predators. I got followed by a fox a few times, but each time I cornered and killed him within about 30 seconds.\n\nThe most tense moment I had was when some wolves appeared from nowhere. One chased me and knocked me down. The screen faded to black and when I woke up, one of my kittens was gone. It all happened too fast to be a tense moment, and I must admit, I didn't feel any sadness about the missing kit.\n\nOverall, I still think this series has potential. If you have not played either Shelter or Shelter 2, I would really suggest that you go and play the first one before deciding whether to purchase Shelter 2.\n\nPros:\n- The art style is absolutely gorgeous, as always.\n- Lovely, atmospheric soundtrack.\n- Controls feel very smooth.\n- Much more expansive world.\n\nCons:\n- Repetitive. Most of your time will be spent chasing rabbits.\n- The tutorial tips are a bit too minimal. They lack explanation and function in favour of looking stylish.\n- Too easy. Food is plentiful and I honestly didn't feel like my kits were at risk at any time.\n- No replay value. You can raise more cubs, but you'll still spend most of your time chasing rabbits.\n","December 29, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a game that succsessfully pulled some of my emotions, especially stress, as it is almost always in the back of your mind. It's meant to be explored this game, all the while having something to do, although it doesn't change. I'd say once you've succsessfully raised your cubs pleanty of times, it becomes less of the game it was, HOWEVER, playing after a long break from the game is almost like getting the game the first time, just with the extra knowledge and skill.\n\nBasically,\nPros:\n- Art Style\n- Animation / Models\n- Music and sound effects\n- Your cubs\n- Return to the game as one of them, in adulthood\n- Optional Collecables\n- Survival Mode\n- You can continue playing around after the cubs leave (Can get a little boring, but its fun to toy around with the wolves)\nCons:\n- It's repeating the same Feed and Protect\n\n... Darn, can't think of any other cons. Personally.\nI would recconmend some things, but probably a bit out of reach.\n- Possible animal selection. Example would be to play as a bear or wolf.\n- Predators such as foxes walk around instead of spawn\n- More pelts for other animals, like white foxes\n- Possibly able to see other predators walk around and hunt, like a lone wolf.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed this game.

The good is that it's perfect for any avid treasure hunter, even having secret skins which can be unlocked by finding everything, but it falls short with the lack of steam cloud support. It was quite disappointing when I switched to a new computer and saw that my progress had been lost. The family tree disappears as well.\nKind of kills the replayability for me.\n\nEither way, its a fun game. You play as a mother Lynx as you explore the open world terrain to find food and 'shelter' your cubs from danger. These dangers can be unexpected and unpredictable, and unless you act quickly, a life may be lost.\n\nSome things are shrouded in mystery and gives you a feeling of errieness to the world of Shelter. Though most of which causes the creepy atmosphere is the wonderful veriety of music. The music is great and really does set the tone for the game.","March 6","true","44.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The atmosphere is beautiful and the artwork is magnificent. The controls are a little tricky, but you get used to it after a while.\nThe game itself can be heartbreaking. Since you must provide for your cubs, you become attached to them, so once one goes missing you actually start to worry. That plus the fact that the cubs cry at you when they are in the midst of dying is a great ploy to tear out tears from the players.\nHunting and exploration in the game is great. With the ability to sense/smell your prey before you even see them is nice. Plus the fact that you can kill eagles is pretty awesome.\nI'd go on and on about this game but it's getting late. Basically, if you like casual games and like to feel like your heart is being pulled out, then get Shelter 2.\n8/10.

I'd say once you've succsessfully raised your cubs pleanty of times, it becomes less of the game it was, HOWEVER, playing after a long break from the game is almost like getting the game the first time, just with the extra knowledge and skill.\n\nBasically,\nPros:\n- Art Style\n- Animation / Models\n- Music and sound effects\n- Your cubs\n- Return to the game as one of them, in adulthood\n- Optional Collecables\n- Survival Mode\n- You can continue playing around after the cubs leave (Can get a little boring, but its fun to toy around with the wolves)\nCons:\n- It's repeating the same Feed and Protect\n\n... Darn, can't think of any other cons. Personally.\nI would recconmend some things, but probably a bit out of reach.\n- Possible animal selection. Example would be to play as a bear or wolf.\n- Predators such as foxes walk around instead of spawn\n- More pelts for other animals, like white foxes\n- Possibly able to see other predators walk around and hunt, like a lone wolf.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed this game.

I was never a big fan of playing through indie-games or any game relative to this manor.\n\nIt is a short game I completed my first play through within 1-2hours.\n\nYou start as a Lynx being chased by wolves, as you run with haste to find a den to give birth to your four cubs. ( All four cubs can be named to your like.)\nAfter birth you hunt for food to feed your cubs and your self.\nIn my play through all four of my cubs survived, through the end of Winter to the next I watched my four cubs grow and at the start of autumn, when the hills shimmer red you must see them off into the wilderness.\nYou then join your life long compainion.\n\nOver all I give this game an 8/10\nPros -\n-Heart Touching\n-Cute graphical art style\n-Easy to learn controls\n-Multiple Play throughs\n-Vast open world to roam through\n-Amazing music\n\nCons -\n-No use of shelter/den after the first night.\n-Not a wide variety of animals to hunt,\n-No use of real suvival elements i.e Weather change effects, a need to consume water, shelter etc.\n-Limited controls, even though the game has an easy to  learn control set it is very limited in what you can do. I would suggest in the future adding in a more indepth control scheme such as buttons to allow your cubs to follow or stay, and to hunt with you as they get older.\n\n\nIf you enjoy indie survival games, this would be a great pick overall. Its very heart warming expierence, I even had a tear in my eye as I saw my cubs off.\nIts a sweet and short game that is able to be enjoyed by anyone who picks it up.

I got pleasure however just from seeing my new cubs and their pretty colors (although my last three litters have been clones of the past litters, so now I wonder if I imagined it x_x )\n\nThe game is difficult at first but I'd actually suggest never using normal mode if you really want the threat of cub-loss hanging over your shoulder.\n\nBy "Unrewarded for exploration" I mean that the beginning area is ultimately the best, biggest area for rabbits, mice, and minimal dangers (even with the expansion). Traveling across ice to places I hadn't touched or even going to the Mountains raised the chances of starvation up significantly. Maybe it was just my luck, but I've decided to only explore for the eye candy, not to look for the promised lands. You start in the promised lands.\n\n\nOne playthrough I think is worth your money, especially if you get it on a discount. However if you're like me and like to play games for hours and hours, you're either going to have to really like immersing yourself into the role of a lynx or make your own goals (or enjoy collecting things). Personally enforcing rules on yourself (like no mice), or aiming to catch as many rabbits as possible have been fine enough goals to keep me going.

That said, I wasn't completely let down, but it didn't come close to blowing me out of the water either. I honestly can't decide whether to give it a thumbs up or not because it has good aspects, but a lot of it is very stale and lacking in potential.\n\nThe art style is great and incredibly unique, I've never seen anything quite like it before. It manages to look very hand-painted despite being 3d rendered, and isn't so bizarre that its disorienting. The main selling point for this game is probably the art style.\n\nOn to less appreciable things: gameplay, potential, and overall opinion.\n\nI've got a beast of a computer, but I think this game is just coded in such a way that it begins to shoot itself in the foot after 15 minutes of playtime. Framerate goes right in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ regardless of graphics settings, and I had to close and reopen the game every so often just to be able to even play it. (Maybe something to do with the data endlessley compiling and not wiping itself when you leave an area and it becomes no longer relevant? Who knows.)\n\nIn between dealing with the game running like molasses for no discernible reason, I found myself struggling to rationalize a reason to play it beyond getting a few easy achievements. The point is simple: sniff, find a rabbit or whatever, run at it and hope the game doesn't lag so badly you can't catch it before your kittens starve. There's no direction- you just wander around and kill stuff over and over until your kittens grow up and start killing their own stuff, by which point you are mostly superfluous- and then they leave, and you go home. That's it.\n\nA few freak events make it kind of interesting, but its mostly just annoying because the fires and lightning strikes and floods are almost guaranteed to kill at least one kitten if you don't run like hell, and they look choppy as if they were thrown in last minute. I spent a good two minutes in a "flood" before I realized what it was supposed to be, I just thought the game was glitching at first.\n\nBasically, get this game only if it goes on a reeealllyy good sale and you don't have high expectations.","December 8, 2015","false","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style, the development, and the storyline all feel like it's been improved immensely. The world is vast and open, making you feel like you really have the map to breath in around you. Even the cubs are downright adorable, making you feel attached as soon as you begin to care for them. You can even name them.\n\nHowever this game could use a tiny bit more explanation of how to play in the beginning. It comes off as a little confusing, and hunting techniques take a really long time to understand and develop. To be honest though, this makes it feel more realistic in the facts that real life doesn't come with a manual on how to play.\n\nThe first time I actually lost a cub was very heart wrenching for me, and each time I lost another, I lost more motivation to keep playing. The attachment you grow with them (if you're not completely heartless, or if you're just a big softy like me) is huge and you'll probably  get annoyed every time you get close to loosing one in a storm, to a predator, or even starvation.\n\n","January 26","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And in the end it is really sad\nHowever it's short and figuring out the mechanics is frustrating. When a cub was starting to die I felt less sadness and more frustration because if you don't play it correctly the cubs most certainly will be pining for your attention often.\n\nIf you can help it you should opt to play this game in a focused environment where you can 100% immerse and devote yourself to creating the world to suite you. If the game was longer, with more content, and better controls the replay value would up tremendously.\n\nAll in all, it's a roleplay game. If you can get it discount you should grab it.

It lets you experience loss yourself so you can understand the fact that life is hard, no matter how hard you try.  The small amount of  instruction i thought was really nice; you get a chance to figure things out and explore yourself, which I haven't seen in many games, and it isn't too compilcated that you don't know what to. Even if you aren't into the exploration and finding all the collectibles, I still think it's worth at least one play through.

I'm sure this is the best game I've played, and I highly recommend it to those who love animals and amazing games. It has a creative, beautiful, and amazing design, and the music is calm and reassuring.\nBefore playing--every day, actually--I get very stressed and frightened and nervous. The first thought that reaches me when I think "Let's play Shelter 2" is "My cubs will die, I will cry, and the flood will kill them or they'll starve". But when I start playing, I get very attached to the cubs and do everything to make possible they live. I always stay close to the den, and I actually love and am very good at hunting moles. Within days of playing, you realize how easy it is to avoid danger and learn to be an excellent hunter. In my third generation, I was Mouse, mother of Raven (black/gay) Sunset (orange/markings) Cliff (light brown/mottled) and Rabbit (white/markings)\n|I headed out of the den to hunt, and for the first time, I saw there were no rabbits. So I went to the left and found, like, two of them. I didn't wait to stalk them, just darted after them. I managed to catch one, and quickly gave it to my waiting cubs. After that, I found around four rabbits in a group. I killed one and hurried back to the den. When the cubs walked out, Raven and Sunset were the plumpest. Rabbit was very thin and small, while Cliff was lithe and long. We set off through open ground, and in the summer land, I was unlucky to unexpectedly find few prey. When I gave my cubs rabbits, I couldn't get the two cubs in need of food together, and Raven always stole her littermates' piece. She became lean and big, while the others remained tiny. Seconds later, the flood came. As soon as the music stopped and the sky became gray, I grabbed Rabbit in my jaws and raced back to the den. But I had to grab Sunset afterwards, for she was too scared to follow. After it was gone, I brought them to the forest to seek out for prey. It was autumn, and I was surprised at how much moles I caught in the meantime. But I almost cried when Rabbit starved. She was the smallest. We continued to eat, Raven still the fattest. I was proud when she started to give her sisters the food, and soon Sunset and Cliff became the strong cubs they were. They grew up into half-grown lynxes. I almost jumped out of my body in fright as Sunset collapsed on her side and started mewling for food. Raven, Cliff, and I raced into a grassy forest. I caught a pheasant--enough for the three--but Raven and Cliff ate it. There was a pool. I heard Sunset cry. My hopes fading, I started to drink from the pool. I was like O_O when Sunset crawled awkwardly and so fast to the pool, drank, and rose to her paws. Then we started hunting in the forest. Sunset hunted moles like me, while the others prefered rabbits. Then they became full-grown. I called for them to say good-bye, but they just raced away and rejected the mole I gave them. I ate it and went back to the den, where I died, and then met Mouse, my mother.|\nIt was a very good experience. Now I'm on my fifth generation. The game is perfect, and I'm looking forward to buying the Mountains DLC. Enjoy it, it is a full enjoyable game <3\n","January 5","true","24.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It's a game that succsessfully pulled some of my emotions, especially stress, as it is almost always in the back of your mind. It's meant to be explored this game, all the while having something to do, although it doesn't change. I'd say once you've succsessfully raised your cubs pleanty of times, it becomes less of the game it was, HOWEVER, playing after a long break from the game is almost like getting the game the first time, just with the extra knowledge and skill.\n\nBasically,\nPros:\n- Art Style\n- Animation / Models\n- Music and sound effects\n- Your cubs\n- Return to the game as one of them, in adulthood\n- Optional Collecables\n- Survival Mode\n- You can continue playing around after the cubs leave (Can get a little boring, but its fun to toy around with the wolves)\nCons:\n- It's repeating the same Feed and Protect\n\n... Darn, can't think of any other cons. Personally.\nI would recconmend some things, but probably a bit out of reach.\n- Possible animal selection. Example would be to play as a bear or wolf.\n- Predators such as foxes walk around instead of spawn\n- More pelts for other animals, like white foxes\n- Possibly able to see other predators walk around and hunt, like a lone wolf.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed this game. It's honestly stunning.\n","January 5","true","83.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Avoid wolves and catch rabbits, lemmings, frogs, pheasants and deer to keep your family alive as the seasons change. Overall the game is pretty easy-going. There's not as much of a story like there was in Shelter 1.\nThe SETTING is particularly interesting. The deer in Shelter 2 have long fangs, and I'm told fanged deer have long since been extinct. There is also a dead wooly mammoth in the glacier area of the map as well, which leads me to think Shelter 2 takes place in some sort of late ice age. VERY COOL!!!

T_T\n\nThis game is just amazing, I got it on sale but I'm most definitely willing to support this company by buying the DLC they currently have and any more they may release for this great game. I hope everyone is willing to give this game a shot, it has something that most survival games are missing, some sort of fear or worry for the defenseless and the struggle to keep a family alive from the harsh environment.","May 28","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Better tutorial, better gameplay, better story, generally an improvement over all. Even the graphics, though the same blocky shaping as the first, is better resolution-wise. I've been able to get all four cubs to survive into adulthood and watching them leave actually did sting a bit, you spend a lot of time making sure they get their next meal and don't get eaten by an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ eagle. You're invested by the time it happens and hoping you can keep the family together. I'm looking forward to expanding the family tree and seeing just how big I can get it, as well as how many collectables I can grab on the way.","June 5","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved the first one, and I love this one too. The art, soundtrack\music, and story of both games if astounding on so many levels. I do have a couple of questions though; (I have not bought the Mountains add-on yet, all though I plan too)\n-In one of the videos it shows Mother Lynx, or Inna, hunting deer like creatures. I did not incounter these, although I did look the second play through, and was not succesful. Do these show up on the Mountain add-on only? Or was i just looking in the wrong places?\n-Just a heads up for new player, if you care at all, you might not see those deer in the regular Shelter 2 game without the add-on, Mountains.\n-I also recommend you get the Mountains add-on, I haven't yet (but I plan too), I think it will improve the gameplay tremendously.\n-Also note that if you can't get the Mountains add-on, there is a setting to make gameplay harder without the add-on. Also not that it still doesn't add mountains, dont want any confusion here.\n-If you read this far, then you are a very determined person with a good sense of mind, and I admire your curiosity that keeps you going.

From then you raise cubs, with different growth stages, and you must kill a wide variety of prey to feed yourself and your offspring. I also wanted  realistic weather systems and the need to keep cubs warm in the winter. I wanted a day/night cycle with different prey and predators that come out during certain time periods. And to complete the game I wanted lasting injuries, a hunger, thirst, temperature, and maybe even a sleep bar, and when you die you continue as one of your surviving cubs.\n\nWhat I got:\n\nVery pretty graphics, repetitive cut scenes, and reletively boring and repititive gameplay. I would say that the most immersive part of the game is the prey/predator system. The prey options are bunnies, deer, voles, pheasants, owl eggs, and frogs, also if you have the mountains DLC then it adds foxes and I think thats it. The predators are wolves, this extremely creepy black blob thing, and  starvation if you call that one. The mountains DLC adds eagles, foxes, bears, and forest fires.\nThe tutorials are very vague and confusing, and its impossible to really tell when your cubs are  hungry so you just have to feed them constantly.\n\nOver all this is the perfect game for you if you really enjoy looking at the beautiful graphics, and like running around as a cute four-legged animal with a bunch of mini cute four-legged animals following you, catching bunnies and occasionally running away from wolves and stuff. But for the peeps who want a realistic animal life sim, this isn't the game for you.","June 28, 2015","false","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
