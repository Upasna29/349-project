It's a game that I'm finding is fun both if you only have a few minutes to kill or if you have time to really try to go through to the end.  I like the visual style of the game, it's very colorful with nicely animated characters.  The controls for character movement are really precise.\n\nI think that if you like older arcade games like the original Gauntlet then you'll have fun with this game.  As far as the price goes, for me I think it's worth the price.  It has the feel of an old school arcade game that I would have dropped more than six dollars in quarters in.\n\nThe only con for me is that I wish the controls could be remapped.  When using an xbox controller, I wish the attacks could be mapped to the second stick instead of the buttons.  Also I have an arcade controller that I think would be great for this game if I could set the controls to use it.  Keyboard/mouse are fine as is if that's what you want to use.","April 1, 2015","true","1.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The gameplay is so simple, yet so addictive. This is a hard as nails arcade action dungeon crawling game. I'd also say it has a hint of rogue-like too.\n\nThere are plenty of classes to choose from as with most fantasy type games, my favorite here has to be the mage, his spells get so overpowered once you rank them up. I did also spend some time playing as an archer but I struggled to find my stride there.\n\nAs you roam around the dungeon killing the endless supply of enemies, you collect their coin and can upgrade your spells and weapons, along with buying additional lives and hearts. You have hearts per life, run out of lives and you have to start all over again. Thankfully there is some sort of gated progression here, each portal has three levels to it. As long as you beat the end boss in each portal, you'll only have to repeat one level, and not the whole game again.\n\nI cannot wait to try out the local co-op here and can support up to four players! The controls are so responsive to your movements, it is almost perfect.  This is an absolute gem of a bargain at its current price as there is tons of gameplay and replay ability here.\n","April 10, 2015","true","1.7"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","17","29","0","0"

The character and attack animation all looks nice too. Wide variety of enemies sprites as well.\n_Plays well: Controls exactly as you'd expect it. Feels precise.\n_Co-op: The game has co-op, and co-op play should make almost any game better.\n\nCons:\n_Bare-boned: This whole game feels like one level. The enemies, while varied in looks, mostly behave the same way. The levels are all the same too, with no set-pieces or events or anything interesting. The 4 chracters are basically only 2 characters: The melee type, and the ranged type. Chracters upgrade in a linear fashion twice, but there's no variety in term of how they're upgraded. There's no items that change the way you play. Shops only sell the same thing over and over. The list goes on.\n_Short, really really short: I mean, it's really short. Might be a blessing, I suppose, if you're not having a good time. But it's hard to excuse a game that is THIS short, even on a $6 price tag.\n_Co-op is only local: Minor point, really, but worth mentioning.\n_WAY too easy, too.\n\nIs it worth $6? I'm afraid not, and that's coming from the guy that gives every game the benefit of the doubt. It's simply too short, too shallow, too dumb, too easy, too simple. There's nothing here for you, the gamer. Game dev, if you're reading this, this is not a game, it's a level. It's a good start, but not enough is here.","March 30, 2015","false","1.0"," 33 of 60 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","33","60","3","3"

You can easily get 3-4hrs of fun out of it, plus another 3 if you go for the secret and 100% achievement completion. There is also 2-4 player local co-op for some quick arcade style fun.\n\nConsider this a casual arcade game that gets you into the action quickly but doesn't require a lot of investment. The sounds are enjoyable but I found myself disabling the music within the first hour of play, it loops fairly quickly but that is common and expected in indie games.\n\nThere are two ranged and two melee characters, each with different speed/attack/defense stats based on your style of play. You can upgrade each character twice with an upgrade powerup purchased from a shop or found during gameplay.\n\nThe maps are randomized each playthrough and there is a map stone on each level that can help you find the exit. I like the random maps because they are drawn like a classic maze, or a cornmaze, lots of winding corners and a dead end. If I pay attention it's not too hard but if I space out I find myself going in circles.\n\nI didn't experience any bugs or stability issues and was glad to find that all features of the game and achievements worked fine.","August 31, 2015","true","2.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The visuals are basic, the mechanics are basic and the content is basic. It seems fun at first but by the end of the first couple of short levels you will have seen pretty much everything the game has to offer. It's really just a mindless grind through endlessly respawning enemies.\n\nThe are many dungeon crawlers on Steam and almost all of them are better than this one. My advice would be to buy Hammerwatch instead; it's a far superior game in every way.","December 21, 2015","false","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sadly, it doesn't offer much depth, but it isn't an expensive title. This is first impressions of the game.\n\nA peaceful kingdom is treathen by dark presence. A labyrinth of pure evil, with an army unlike any seen before. So, now it's up to four Champions to save the kingdom. Simple story.\n\nThis is 2D game, so the lacking of video options is understandable. So is the rebindable keys to ceratin degree. It would be nice to change them. The graphics are retro pixel art with a lot of colours\n\nThere is four classes to choose from. Those are the Champions. I only play with the Wizard. With him the gameplay is a twin-stick shooter. You have only one attack â€“ a projectile and that's it. Well, there is more, but not much. In the levels you can find or buy upgrades. They change your projectile and your appearance. The wizard can be upgraded two times, I don't know about the others. The only other thing that can help you are scrolls. They are one time use magic spell. Health, Mace, Summon, Shield and Radiant. The last is extremely powerful clearing spell. You can carry one at a time. There is nothing more to the gameplay.\n\nWith the gold you collect from dead enemies, chests and everything that explodes, you can buy from a shop inside the level lives (yes, there are lives here), scrolls, health and upgrades and nothing more.\n\nDungeons or labyrinths are pretty diverce as layout. I saw ice cave, mines with tracks, grass, dirt or gold and so on. All levels are randomly generated, which add to the replayability. When you enter a labyrinth you have to find a key, then the exit. Also there is place with a map, that shows where those things are and the shop. There is no mini map and sometimes it's a little bit confusing. Before every boss you have to make it through series of levels. The first is small, but they get progressively larger. The labyrinth with the boss encounter are pretty big and without a mini map it can take you a while to find the key and the exit.\n\nEnemies are okay. Different types of spiders, ghosts, archers, knights and so on. When they surround they are dangerous. The game is pretty intense and I like that. The bosses are creative and fun to fight.\n\nEffects resemble 8-bit games from the past and they are nice. Music is okay, but not very memorable. I can't think of a single track.\n\nThe games is okay. It's very colorful with responsive controls and it's fun for a while. There is local co-op, but didn't try it. Probably it will be more fun with a friend, but I think it's a mistake not to have online multiplayer. Sadly, my biggest disappointment is the lack of gameplay depth. One projectile and scrolls. I played almost two hours and i'm already getting bored. It's just functional, fun little game. But when you consider the prise, I think the game is alright. Get the game on sale and find a friend to play with you.","December 17, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You run around randomly generated levels to first find a key and then exit the current floor with it in another location. You get a few classes to play, I took the knight. COmbat was very simple, just hold the left mouse button to spam a wild swing. It all boils down to rush levels and crush everything to keep your health up with pickups.

Graphics and sound are decent, music is a little weak. I would rather have used twin-stick control.\n\nI wish games had a little intro screen that explained a little, like during the attract mode of classic arcade games like PacMan, Galaxian..\n\nBecause I didn't realize what kind of game it was. The point of this game is not to continue getting more powerful and enjoying the rewards, but simply to complete the game.\n\nThe challenge keeps ramping up, but the rewards do not. There are 3 levels up upgrades you can find pretty quickly and then you just play the game like that. You can't save your progress and continue later....\n\nThere are 3 parts of the game, and once you finish a part, you permently unlock the next part, it seems. So you can start a new game and start at part 2.\n\nBut I found that if you want to try to get anywhere in the game, it will be significantly easier to play it from begining to end, starting at part 1.\n\nBut the first section is where you become powerful and build up like 10 lives. The second part is where you get bored. :p But theoretically, if you keep the momentum going, you have enough lives to bully your way through the game. If you try to pick up and play from part 2 or part 3 another time, you will be at a severe disadvantage starting those challenging areas without the 3 upgrades and lots of lives.","October 31, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So that's a positive point :D\n\nGameplay is ok too, but quickly boring as you keep shooting and shooting against endless waves of foes.\nOnly problem that i have is the fact that there is almost no replay value, unless you're curious about the story. Every time you die, you're good to start over from scratch, and i really don't like that in a rogue like game.\n\nSo all in all, this game is cool, and will be probably even cooler with friends to play with. Even if it's not the game of the year, it is totally worth its very low price, and might and the studio making new games ;) So if you have a couple dollars to donate, that might be a good idea to put them here.","February 16","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't exactly remember when/how I got it, but I wanted to play a dungeon crawler, popped this one in, and was surprised by it.\n\nFrom what I've collected, this game seems to have had a rocky history/start, but I can't really find anything major to gripe about it. I'd imagine major issues have since been patched by the time I played this game.\n\nAttack of the Labyrinth is pretty basic and it can be beaten in about 80 minutes if you're experienced with the genre, slightly longer if not. It's hard to get a game over in this game because if you're decent at it and like to explore you'll either find a ton of 1UP's or be able to buy lots of them from the store. There are two endings that I'm aware of and the requirements to get the "good" ending aren't that hard.\n\nMy only real gripe is that there's something weird going on with the achievements, namely that some people think one of them is outright broken, and that there are a couple whose unlock requirements are unclear. As I write this review there's no guide and no insight on the forum as to what's what. If you're looking for completion, I'd stay away from this one.\n\nThe game is a "solid 5" on a 1-10 scale, to me at least.","April 13","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
