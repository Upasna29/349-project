He and I had a nice conversation about this game and some ideas for it.\n\nOtherwise, Tacopocalypse is a very fun and fast-paced car game, I cannot wait for the game to leave Early access!","January 24","true","3.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This gave me more fun than Tom Clancy the Division and COD BOP 3 combined. The developer influence from Rocket League, Tony Hawk and Jet Star Radio has allowed the game to become a combination of the three and flourish as it own game. So far all review so far have been extremely good and this is no difference. This game is true fun which is all you want from one, you can play with friend, high replayablilty, great soundtrack and more. Nothing to prove. Game of the Year Award. Viva Del Tacopocalyse.","March 10","true","15.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Maybe future releases could feature objectives like the old THPS? Maybe we could see an online mode? I could go on with how giddy this throwback is getting me.","February 8","true","0.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Need I say more? Okay, I'll say a bit more. ;)\n\nPROS:\nCrazy Taxi meets Tony Hawk Pro Skater in this beautifully colored cartoony playground of skateboard-cars. Not to mention the word's ending so everything's exploding! This game features awesome graphics, fun gameplay, local multiplayer, multiple game modes, fluid controls, and innovative mechanics.

I've got Steam on Mac (which it works for Mac). The game will start up, but every time I choose practice mode or customization, the game crashes and sends me to the desktop.
