Also great documentation, although the game/toy itself is fairly straight forward to figure out. It would be nice if you could scroll and zoom around a little faster, but this doesn't affect the enjoyment of playing with the software. Would recommend to anyone with a musical streak.","May 4","true","0.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","2"
