Let me explain. I had a prison going, a real human rights violation if ever there was one. 300 high-violence inmates crammed into a single holding cell like animals. They had 10 beds to share among them. Two (working) toilets. Three showerheads. Constant shakedown searches, armed and k9 guards every twenty feet. A 25 square foot exercise yard where they were forced to spend most of their days crammed together like sardines. At lunch time, most of them didn't even get to eat. They were hungry, smelly, and angry. But they never rioted. They kept to themselves and just walked around all day complaining.\n\nSo I sold the prison. And I built another one. This was a utopia. Most of the offenders were normal risk. I had adequate housing, food, staff, showers. It was clean. Every cell had a TV. Most of their day was spent in free time. I had GED classes for them, substance abuse programs. And THAT wasn't good enough for them. It all started with one inmate. "Fish" was his nickname. He goes to his alcoholics class and within a matter of minutes, he beats the therapist to death right in front of the other inmates! What a jerk. The other inmates must have become stricken with terror because as I'm locking the guy in the hole, another inmate stabs a new arrival to death right in front of a guard. The new arrival hadn't even been booked into processing yet and there he is bleeding out on the shower room floor! As the guards are dealing with stabby mcstabberson, two more inmates start tearing the beds out of the walls in their cells so they catch beatdowns from the guards too.\n\nAt that point, the other prisoners decide they want no part of any of that and go off to their cells. The murderers / violent offenders spend 48 hours in solitary.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that this game is awesome, especially considering it's Early Access.","June 13, 2014","true","47.8"," 966 of 1,036 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","966","1","3","27"

Prison Architect is pretty much exactly what it sounds like it is going to be. It's a prison simulation game where you manage a prison. But it does that very well!\n\nThere are different ways to play but in one way you get a certain number of minimum, normal, and maximum security prisoners dropped off every day. You need to make room in your prison for these guys, you need to keep them happy, and you need to make sure they don't run away or kill each other.\n\nTo start off you can either build a large holding cell or smaller individualized cells (the individual cells are much more expensive but it keeps the prisoners happier). Each prisoner has needs like the need to shower, to eat, to sleep, to go out to the yard, to talk to their family, etc. You can see these stats on a per prisoner basis or as an overall stat at the top of your screen. The more unhappy your prisoners are the more likely they are to try to escape, to cause a riot, to kill people, etc.\n\nThe other thing you need to keep in mind is money. You are running a for-profit prison after all. You can get money from grants at the start of the game (they are kind of like mini quests where you get half the money up-front and the other half once you complete the objective) and you also get money depending on the number of prisoners you have. You spend money every day on things like food, guards, other staff members, etc. You can hire less staff members or reduce the quality of the food but there are risks to doing those things.\n\nSo what's the endgame? Once (and only once) you decide your prison is profitable enough, you can sell it. The game gives you a monetary score depending on how well you did. You can use this money to start your next prison and make it even better.","November 15, 2013","true","17.2"," 755 of 805 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","755","805","0","6"

It has workshop integration with an active modding community. Earlier tonight I changed the theme to star wars with a press of the button. This is a very addictive game where real time begins to speed by in a blur. 5 minutes becomes 5 hours and you only noticed because you need to use the restroom. There is a wonderful charm about it and the fat little characters. There is a lot of micromanagement so if you're the kind of person that hates to think, can't oil your brain because it hurts, well then you should pass. It's not overly complicated but the game doesn't hold your hand starting out. It's like bam build a prison. The only downside is struggling to figure out why things aren't being built, or populated. This may further confuse someone since it is alpha which makes it difficult to distinguish between a bug and something you aren't doing correctly. Other than that you should enjoy this game.","November 2, 2014","true","179.8"," 665 of 715 people (93%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","93","665","715","33","5"

The game was buggy, limited and filled with core problems but the base idea was still really interesting and I saw a lot of potential. Over the years the game has been polished little by little and I'd say, at this point, the game feels incredibly solid. It's refreshing to see indie developers who legitimately care about making a good game and aren't just focused on appealing to a huge audience and making money.\n\nYou play as a warden, build a prison from the ground up, and get regular paychecks to keep inmates locked away. You need to make sure the prisoners have basic needs met like food and entertainment, otherwise they'll get rowdy and start trouble (like murdering each other, or breaking things). The concept is very straight-forward. As someone who enjoys games like Sim City and Dwarf Fortress (as well as prison movies) this was very up my alley.\n\nYou can min-max the perfect prison, or you can just have fun with it and design a chaotic madhouse that's destined to fail. My favorite prison design, my own invention of course, is to have every single part of the prison connect to one center room. That center room is the "warden's office + shower" combo. Watch as the warden lives a constant life of fear while the 50+ maximum security prisoners cram their way into the showers meant for no more than 10 people at a time. The warden is sitting there with lamenated paperwork, crying, trying to get something done while all these ruthless thugs wash up. The previous warden is floating, face down in the shower water, right next to the new warden's desk. Yep. Good times.\n\nRating: A","October 4, 2015","true","35.8"," 347 of 361 people (96%) found this review helpful 226 people found this review funny","96","347","361","226","7"

Well for starters this game was made by an indie company, no big publisher backing Introversion, they have done an amazing job getting this game to where it is at this time. In short, buy this game it is an amazing experience.\n\nFor those who wish to read, I will now go over the pros and cons of this game in detail.\n\nPros:\n\nBuild just the way you want:\n\nThere are very few contraints when building. I'd liken it to Sims 3 from a top down perspective in terms of building. It's great fun.\n\nCartoony but realistic at the same time:\nThe game has a very distinctive art style that is unique to the game, but it deals with serious topics such as if you will execute a death row prisoner or not, or if you will keep a prisoner locked up for virtually all of his day. This game makes you think.\n\nIt's tough, but only if you want it to be/You can go at your own pace:\nThe aim of the game is not to amass one billion dollars, but to have the lowest reoffending rate for released prisoners, and every in game day can be marginally relaxing if you want it to. For instance you can run a low-security, generally free environment where the aim is to rehabilitate your prisoners through the use of classes you can run, or you can run a max-sec environment punishing the most hardcore of criminals. It's all up to you.\n\nA dedicated team:\nI have watched nearly every alpha video that has been published, and I can clearly see that Introversion software is very passionate about the project. There were (As of writing this it's about a day off offical release) new features each month, and it was a pleasure to watch each and every video.\n\nIf you enjoyed Sim City you'll love this. There are features very soon to be released I haven't gone over yet,  as well as features I missed,but you'll see for yourself.\n\nCons:\n\nSomewhat gruelling at the start:\n\nAfter putting a good 200 hours into the game as a whole, this is probably my most major complaint with the game, is that in the beginning you start with 30K and the only way you can make money is via grants, but selling your first prison is practically the only way to make cash when you're still learning the ropes.\n\nOverall a solid 8.5/9 out of 10, certainly one of the best sim and strategy/managment games I have ever played. For $30 you will get a lot of fun out of this.

At the time of review I have 210 hrs of game time in.  Far behind in my library at #2 is Kerbal Space Program with 105.  This game is perfectly paced, completely open to infinite designs and has so much depth I can easily see hitting 500hrs.  After the latest update (alpha 31) this game is packed with content and the workshop offers massive expansion and awesome mods (Imperial architect being my current fav.  Star wars prison!).\n\nPros:\nAs big as you wanna be!  Want to make a small 25 person prison  that runs efficiently and makes money with minimum security bluecollar criminals?  Go ahead!  Want to make a 500 person Max security only iron curtain that can hold and control intensely volatile and psychotic madmen?  Sure can!\n\nWell designed!  The UI and indicators for things like prison heat, tech tree, controlling and managing intake and regime of the inmates and hiring and firing staff, as well as prison programs is easy to understand and impliment.  I've played plenty of games that after opening them up and fiddling with for 20 minutes I can hardly make heads or tails of the UI or it has infinitely frusturating menus to navigate or item info to memorize.  Not so with PA.\n\nEntertaining!  Set up phone taps and learn a prisoner has set up a time for someone to throw booze over the wall into the garbage area?  Watch them toddle over into the area and as they head back inside stop them and counter their contraband!  Initiate shakedowns to find inmates who have dummys in their beds and are digging tunnels!  The excitement of unearthing a tunnel they have been digging for days that NEARLY reached the outside but was thwarted is always satisfying.  Recruit confidential informants to reveal persons who have knives, needles, poison SHOTGUNS in their cells.  Use sniffer dogs to inspect incoming food and items to ensure they are poison and piano wire free.  The combinations and implications are endless.\n\nNo two prisons are ever the same!  One prison may be full of raging alcoholics, another may be a mix of volatile angry inmates and ex law enforcment or snitches that must be contained and seperated or death ensues!  My last prison had 3 legendary prisoners, each capable of disarming and killing guards in a single punch.  Not only must you constantly learn to streamline your prison and improve every aspect of the design you also have to adapt and keep tabs on your current and incoming prisoners, keeping the troublemakers at bay and keeping your staff running smoothly.\n\nCons:\n\nStill early access.  This isnt necessarily a con but something to be take into consideration.  This game has all the content and playability and optimization of a full release but as new features ar implimented new bugs invariably creep up.  In the most recent patch my cooks tend to randomly pile dirty trays in the cells of my supermax and solitary prisoners.  Later in the day they pick them up and wash them.  On occasion I will assign a block to eat in a specific canteen, and then assign a specific kitchen to feed them.  Later on suddenly I will check my prisoners needs and some are starving.  I will check my food distribution screen and randomly the kitchen and canteen to cellblock link is totally gone.  Its not perfect, but none of these bugs or issues are anywhere near game breaking and are fairly smalltime.\n\nIn conclusion get this game.  The developers are awesome, the game is amazing, and its not even complete yet!  I look forward to future updates and features and the workshop community is actively making new mods regularily that add even more to the experience.  98/100","April 5, 2015","true","362.1"," 164 of 171 people (96%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","96","164","171","17","1"

And you are told by your boss, the CEO of the "For Profit" Prison, that you have been given the task of executing a murderer. And this order comes from the state itself.\n\nThe game then turns towards teaching you how to work the basic construction tools, explaining power, water, foundations, interior walls, and room basics in a straightforward and clean manner.\n\nThen the game shows you exactly why your prisoner is guilty.\n\nIt is not a pleasant experience to watch as a tiny cartoon man walk into his home, find his tiny cartoon wife ♥♥♥♥ing a tiny cartoon stranger in his bed, and then tearfully shoot them both in the head.\n\nThis gives us the biggest lesson of all: Prison Architect is not a happy game.\n\nPrison Architect is a top down management game where you run your prison company exactly how you want it. As far as the state is concerned, it doesn't matter how high your rehabilitation rate is, all that matters is that you have no escapes, keep the deaths to an acceptable low, and you keep the prisoners in line by any means you deem fit.\n\nOnce you finish your campaign, which takes you through the systems of the game, explaining core concepts quite happily while also telling you tales of loss, pain, murder, ambition, hope, and sheer murderous rage. Of course, the problem is that the game ONLY explains the core mechanics and leaves more complicated ones for you to figure out yourself. That said, while there is a Wiki and many a guide for you, the point of the core game in sandbox mode is mostly to see what works best. To adapt to problems and overcome even of it must be done through trail, error and blood.\n\nThe game provides security measures such as cameras, remote doors opened by a button or a timer, stab vests and tazers for your guards, and even heavily armed maximum force response teams kept on site with shotguns, full body armor, and the will and means to paint your prison red with blood at your command. Along with this the game will provide schedules, assignments, patrols, and even resticted acess zoning, all of which is designed to keep your prisoners under control so they do not kill each other.\n\nAlong with this is provided many means to turn your prisoners into peaceful members of society if you so choose. You may provide basic education, as many prisoners lack even a child's reading and writing skills. And some of them cannot even read at all, let alone write. Give your prisoners trade skills as carpenters or metal workers. Teach them how to be cleaners or work a laundry. And then set up security systems to prevent prisoners stealing hammers or making crude knives.\n\nPrisoners may come with medical issues such as addiction, alchoholism or violent pshycological instability. Build a common room for AA meetings, an office for one on one meetings for professional mental help, an infirmary for chemical treatmeants to help with addiction and minor surgery when the prisoners try to kill, and a mourge when they do kill.\n\nYour prisoners are humans, with desires and needs, thoughts and feelings, and intelligence. Prisoners need to be fed, and you may give them things to do. Build a common room with tables, television sets, and phones. Provide meals at preset times, as many times as you want, in large quantaties and variety if you want, or a simple bowl of vegetable soup once a day if you don't. Prisoners with many things to do are less likey to cause trouble, and giving them these things may make them very happy indeed.\n\nThis does not mean you may treat them like sane members of society. You are running a prison. They are prisoners. And Prisoners are not in the habit of obeying the rules. Prisoners steal, fight, and even kill in your walls. Make no mistake, you and your officers are the only order inside the prison. Without your constant watchful gaze and omnipresent guards the prisoners will fall upon each other like wild animals; killing, fighting, and breaking.\n\nIf your prisoners are exceptionally angry, and if your prison is weak enough, the prisoners may decide that they can do whatever thy want and there is nothing you can do about it. They may decide to riot. Or you may subdue them, show them that any antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated, and make them docile through fear.\n\nProblems may arise in your prison, and of course these are optional. Make it so that he game throws problems your way at random. Maybe a highly contagious disease is rampaging through your prison and killing your prisoners. Perhaps a water main has burst. Maybe a generator has overloaded, causing a fire and a blackout. Or maybe the mayor has bowed to political pressure and decided to implement reform without consulting you.\n\nIf you feel particularly brave, allow the game to generate gangs, and watch as your prison becomes split by three gangs into territories, and attempt to usurp your authority. And then spiral into gang wars, burn your prison down, kill your guards, and extort prisoners.\n\nPrison Architect, ultimately, is exactly what it says it is, with a remarkable and well made game that most will like.  BUt do not expect to laugh because of the cutesy graphics.\n\nThey mitigate the horror, but only make it bearable.","October 25, 2015","true","202.6"," 172 of 182 people (95%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","95","172","182","31","0"

Northern nevada Correction Center and Warm Springs Correctional Center located in Carson City Nevada. That being said, a few games have come out over the years trying to emulate running a prison. Prison Tycoon 1 & 2 were the first that I tried. Both failed miserably. This game has a long way to go, but it is trying... improving... and actually comes close. Riots, gang wars, contraband, escapes and even a death row. Real rehabilitation, if there is such a thing. Not all inmates go back to prison whatever the reason.\n\nThis game is evolving, getting better and feels real on some levels.\n\nA critical review should be just that, critical. So while I give this game a thumbs up, it is not perfect. It has bugs, Some new, some old, but many are recognized and others have been fixed. The developers are working to improve it both in game play and fixing that which is broken. I have not seen a game breaking bug.\n\nAn active community of posted prisons and mods, the spread of ideas and again active developers have made this game more real than it's predicessors and a bit fun.\n\nMy 1 suggestion is to add race tension. Race wars are alive and well in the US prisons. Segregation could be implemented as it is in many prisons. However, Gangs do add an interesting aspect that mimic this, but recruitment is rampant in prisons and should be added as well. Gun towers, a better way to implement sally ports (1 door can not open until the other closes, linking doors together in some way of added user defined rules) and so forth. How about a bit of staff corruption? All of this would make the game more real, challenging and fun.","November 16, 2015","true","135.7"," 157 of 165 people (95%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","95","157","165","10","1"

You can build Holding Cell or Personal Cell even Solitery Cell, depoly guards, dogs and army, build a infarmy facility, construct the CCTV monitor network with remote control doors, teach your prisoners in classroom with reform program and give them works to do, and much more fun in Prison Architect!\nThe most imoportant thing is that Prison Architect provide features to buy adjacency lands to expand your jail.  And you can even sell you jail for some funds to build the next jail with better start facilities!  Last but not least, Prison Architect support Steam Workshop, give this game infinte possibility!\nIf you like Strategy, Building, Managing game, you must try Prison Architect!\n\nPros:\n+ Addictive gameplay.\n+ Simple but nice looking graphic design.\n+ "Grants" gives you short term goals and challenges and rewards.\n+ Various facilities to build and management.\n+ Logic Circuits!\n+ Detail reports to view and manage the whole jail and all prisoners.\n+ Lots of events and works in all time.\n+ Mods and Steam Workshop support!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mechanicallions/recommended/233450/","mechanicallions","Mechanical Lions","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mechanicallions/","552 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI absolutely love sandbox building games that aren't a cosmetic tea party.  This game has done nothing but amuse me as I've tried and failed to manage a prison properly probably a half dozen times now, but that's really the beauty of it. I could probably read a guide and get a lot of "I win" information, but games like these are just big ant farms slash chemisty sets where I like to be forced to evaluate my choices and try to balance a ton of factors into the plan. The best thing about this game is that everything is staged and nothing is instant. Your plan has to work from A to B and it's up to decide what you build or research next, but once you do you've sacrificed something and opened a hole somewhere. Eventually you have moments of stability where things seem to be going ok, but another wrench is thrown and the whole thing can spiral into chaos quickly.\n\nIf you glanced at this and thought it would be a cheap imitation of something that should be labeled "Tycoon" and thrown in a bargin bin, then you are sorely mistaken. This is an OCD stress test of micromanagement, choice making and logistics. It feels like everything matters and sometimes it feels like  everything you do is 5 steps behind the thing you should have already been doing 10 steps ago. Of course you can pace the game at your choices and even play in full "free" mode where you have lots of money, but even still...you aren't inviting kittens into your Barbie Dream House that you are filling up full of cheap furniture. You are inviting murderers and thieves into a house full of other murderers and thieves and it's up to get a TON of variables to play nice with each other.  They are not stupid. They will revolt. They will try to escape. They will steal from the kitchen and try to stab people, etc etc.\n\nThe scope to which this game has expanded is more than impressive and for a game that started off mentioning Dwarf Fortress as it's inspiration, it's created something even more unique that casts it's own shadow. Of course there have been other prison games, but this one has nailed so many concepts perfectly and given the track record for upgrades and patches, there will be more. I have found some bugs and the foundation system took me a while to really get my head around. I have to say the "Planning Mode" is something that every single builder type game needs to embrace right the eff now as well.\n\nThis is a solid recommendation from me even in Early Access state. If you don't like to support that kind of thing, completely understandable. The devs are active and the game has had over 20 patches full of content and fixes just since I've bought it. I actually turned it on just to see how it was progressing and I'm sucked into it and hopeless trying to figure out how last more than 30 minutes without someone dying.

There aren’t many games under 150Mb these days that can give you as much entertainment as the likes of Prison Architect, and it really stands out amongst the ever growing crowd of top down, Theme Park types. Prison Architect flourishes with character and challenges the user with real choices in designing, running and planning a real prison environment. You truly do feel like god in this game and the real challenge comes from managing the character of the prisoners. Social anarchy amongst the prisoner is your biggest threat, but also the most amusing part of the game. You will forever be teetering on toppling your social structure and punishing prisoners for disobedience. It’s a fine line to walk and keeps you engaged & thrilled continually during your campaign.\n\nOnly con’s so far is the steep learning curve and the price.

See Conclusion\nNOTE: As an Early Access Review, this will be subjected to change and editing as newer updates are released.\n\nINTRODUCTION:Prison Architect is a 2D top down prison building and management simulation game made by Introversion Software being financed by crowd-funding, pre-orders and Steam Early Access. Since it's initial release on 2012, the game has undergone several major updates (an average of 4 weeks per update) and has raised nearly $10 Million in revenue.\n\nPLOT (No Spoiler):The player takes on the role of a Prison owner, architect and governor who's objective is to create a prison from an expandable open world map. The player may choose the purpose of their prison either focused on reforming criminals, severe draconian punishment, or a mix of the two. Build the prison from scratch, hire guards and officers, staff and maintenance crew to keep it functioning, dog patrols to keep watch and many more. There is no end to the game, the player just needs to keep building and keep expanding until they decide to sell their prison and build a new one, or, have it burned to the ground because of a riot and find yourself in prison (seriously, your character can go to jail if you're grossly negligent in its management, ironically, in the same prison you built).\n\nPROS:+ Great 2D Art Style\n+ Good Tutorial: Comprehensive and easy to understand\n+ Vast variety of Characters (Staff, Officers, Prisoners, Guards etc)\n+ Expanding World Map: (Buy the adjacent lot to expand)\n+ Detailed Micromanagement System (Prisoner Regime, Guard/Dog Patrols, lock downs etc.)\n+ Detailed Construction System (Buildings, water systems, electrical wiring, computer controls etc.)\n+ Easy to install and uninstall MODS (Steam Workshop)\n+ Monthly Updates from the devs\n+ Old Computer friendly\n+ High Replayability\n\nCONS:- Severe Performance Drop when the prison becomes very large (in size, prisoner and staff)\n- Lacking in Soundtracks\n- Occasional path-finding problems\n- No main menu (minor annoyance and not a deal breaker)\n- No Steam Cloud Support\n- Prisoners are released Naked sometimes\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT EARLY ACCESS GAME. Prison Architect is what all Early Access games should try to be; it has constant updates, great art style, solid core gameplay, stable & playable and most importantly, easy on the pocket even at full price.\n\nWORTH IT?:MUST TRY, whether the game is at full price or sale, it's worth every penny and I fully RECOMMEND it specially if your a City Building / Simulation fan. To be honest, the game is technically finished in my opinion (just need a bit more bug fixing and performance improvements) and has more features than some of the other fully released games I've seen.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

It’s a not finished gaol-management sim that, despite still being under development, is currently available to purchase and play on Steam...and you should.Here’s how Prison Architect plays: you’re given a plot of land and a metric wodge of cash with which to build a prison. About a dozen men found guilty by a jury of their peers turn up once a day expecting the bare minimum of care afforded to them by the state. You can click on them to see their criminal records, but you have no direct control over their movements. Instead you plot out the foundations of buildings, which a team of workmen then construct, before designating functions to the rooms you’ve made. Hastily cobbled together holding cells will accommodate a few prisoners while you construct dozens of smaller individual cells. Showers must be hooked up to plumbing, cooks must be hired to work in kitchens, cafeterias must feed prisoners, guards must open and close locked doors in order to escort inmates, staff and visiting families to and from their destinations.A 24 hour clock ticks along, turning the day to night, with your prisoners adhering to a configurable schedule of sleeping, eating, yard time, work time and free time. The idea is to construct things in such as a way as to keep the largest number of inmates moving efficiently between their cells, showers, laundry rooms, workshops, yards and back to bed, all while keeping the system secure enough to detect smuggled contraband and deter escapees.Accountants and psychologists and security chiefs can all be hired and supplied with furnished offices to unlock new menu screens and information about your prison population. You can take on government grants, which offer you a cash advance in exchange for meeting certain criteria.Besides these grants, Prison Architect is a sandbox balancing act in which happy prisoners require costly amenities and unhappy prisoners will eventually riot, using contraband weapons such as screwdrivers stolen from workshops to stab up their fellow incarcerated. It’s a virtual delinquency ant farm in which you tread the line between your prisoners’ happiness and the prison’s efficiency and safety.et up metal detectors and order extensive searches of every cell and tensions will rise, but neglect to de-shiv your inmates in favour of a feel-good prison atmosphere and those happy prisoners will end up all stabbed to bits in a bodybag.Introversion are not shy about advertising Prison Architect’s in-progress state and their promise to you is that you are directly funding the ongoing development of the game with your purchase, in exchange for monthly updates and, eventually, a copy of the finished game.Prison Architect is a good game in its current state and pretty much the only early access game that hasn't disappointed so far.","December 19, 2014","true","36.0"," 119 of 138 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","119","138","6","3"

Now is your chance! Prison Architect is a simple, fun, top down, real time strategy, management, building game with a lot of depth yet it is so easy to pick up and play. While it is still 'Early access,' it feels complete and polished.\n\nPrison Architect is not like the Sims. You are just building a prison. Everything is not instantly done when you place it. You have workers that take time to go through your prison to carry out what you want. Not just that, but the trucks with the items need to arrive. It is a really nice system and the workers are fast and efficient enough to quickly carry out things. Your workers can die and if things aren't getting done quick enough, hire more workers. Every staff costs X amount to hire them, and Y amount to keep them employed every day. You have funds and a daily budget. Your daily budget cannot be in the red, that becomes the limitation and challenge of the game.\n\nSince this is a prison, every 24 hours new inmates arrive. You need to get ready for them. So you build walls, a holding cell, dozens of private cells, a shower, a yard, a kitchen and a canteen. Then you hire staff and place objects into each room to make them functional. Objects such as beds, benches, tables, kitchen cookers, freezers, a wide sofa for your staff room, desks for your offices and of course a variety of doors. Jail doors, large jail doors, staff doors, solitary confinement doors. These are all objects. Only guards can open jail doors so if one of your worker / laborers needs to get through they need to wait for a guard to let them through.\n\nWhen you start a game, you can select different things to make your game different, such as having randomly generated empty rooms and landscape. You can select whether or not to have 8 normal prisoners per day or a random number of maximum, minimum or normal security prisoners. This adds a lot of variety to each time you start a new game.\n\nThe game lets you do whatever you want, but as a guide, it gives you optional objectives. You can only do 2 objectives at once. That's the beauty of this game, you pick the objectives whenever you want at any time. You're not pigeon holed into a scenario. When you select an objective you will receive a money grant to carry out the objective. There is no time limit. There is just a money limit. Run out of money doing a project and you'll be stuck waiting until your funds build back up. For the most part you are given more than enough money and once you're done with the objective you get the other half of the money. The objectives have a list of mini objectives that benefit and grow your prison. Everything to build a cell block that can hold 15 prisoners to all the steps needed to have a functional medical ward, which involve offices, doctors, an intermarry and a psychiatrist that need to be unlocked in bureaucracy.\n\nOnce you hire a warden, he will open up bureaucracy, which is the game's version of unlocks. You can unlock a slew of new personnel such as a security chief that can unlock cameras, an armory and other things. You can even unlock an accountant that leads to land purchases for when you outgrow your plot of land. These are all nice touches that really let the game feel like your own.\n\nSince you are an architect, you need to lay out pipes and wires. Not just that, but you need to place water pumps, generators and conduits. Every room needs to have wires to it, big items such as freezers and monitors need wires directly to them. If you use too much power for your generator and conduits, it'll result in a power outage and then chaos happens. When it comes to toilets and showers, you have small pipes and large pipes, small pipes lose pressure the further they go, so you need to have large pipes, but the catch is inmates can use large pipes to crawl in and escape. So never have large pipes near inmates. There are other ways inmates can escape, such as tunneling, walking out if they break a door lock and go over an unattended wall.\n\nThe game has emergency services so if you get uncontrollable riots, you can send in an emergency swat team and tell them where to go. If you have a fire, then call for the fire department and you'll see their hoses strung through your prison. EMTs can also be called in, but for the most part your medical ward / infirmary should handle things.\n\nYou have a lot of control over the prisoners including their schedule, how much free time they have, when the have it, when they eat and when they shower. It is helpful for big prisons that have small facilities, you can have the minimum security prisoners eat when the maximums are showering and when the normal prisoners are in the yard. You can unlock restricting certain levels of prisoners to certain areas. On top of that you can even sell and buy stock from your prison.\n\nThere is also a lot of unintentional comedy such as a K9 patrol using a broken toilet, workers getting cemented into walls, inmates killing guards with spoons, and of course the names of inmates and why they're in prison. On top of that there are mods and prison downloads, the game is really about having your fun the way you want to have it.\n\nIn all the game is probably worth $30 and I rarely say that, but its been on sale plenty of times. You can sink a lot of time into the game and enjoy every second of it.","September 12, 2014","true","157.7"," 84 of 89 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","84","89","5","0"

I was pre-disposed with the graphics making the prisoners look less realistic than LEGO toys, but once you start to play, it becomes a non-issue. Designing a prison which almost runs itself is very satisfying, especially when trouble happens but your design means even minor issues are handled automatically. Sometimes big troubles may come and the most interesting part of this game is trying to find a solution to these troubles. You may finally have to re-design the whole area to find a reasonable solution. The weakness of this game is also very obvious. Some small bugs may be annoying but the biggest problem is the game becomes repeptitive after you'd setup a prison with all the features after a few days, which is also a common problem in most simulation games. A lucky thing is this game is still in the Alpha test. So users will get free updates including new features automatically, which could have become a paid DLC separated from the original game after the complete version is released just like what most fcvking EA games do.","February 6, 2015","true","52.6"," 70 of 76 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","70","76","9","0"

One of very few examples of such a phenomenon. From the communications the devs had with the community through both written and video updates, to the constant patching of the game which added significant changes and additions at an incredibly effective pace.\n\nTruly, this game deserves your attention even if you're not interested in its gameplay mechanics or ideas. Simply because we ought to support this kind of transparent, respectful and talented videogame development. We need to show the rest of the industry that hard work and good communication is in the end rewarded.\n\nOh yeah, and the game itself is of course really good. It's like a more complex and more free-form version of Theme Hospital, chock full of intentional and unintentional humor. It's virtually replayable ad infinitum due to the smart integration of really complex systems and mechanics that are still simple enough to get a basic grasp on quickly.\n\nAnd then you add the solid Steam Workshop integration that's already been out for months and months, molding into a vast web of minor tweaks and major total convention mods to further extend your playtime. Like the mod that lets you take control of a prisoner, and use the game's own mechanics to try and break out of your own (or someone else's) prison! How genius is that?!\n\nYou could pay all the salary you're ever going to earn in your entire life, and you'd STILL be able to get a whole lot of bang for your buck with Prison Architect.

You build a prison that hopefully reforms the inmates while trying to fulfill their needs and keep the peace.  Gangs and events really help keep the architect on their toes.  In a blink of an eye chaos can and most likely will ensue.  Keep your eye out for legendary prisoners, they really make things interesting.  If having gangs and events are not your thing you don't have to use them.  You can just not select those things when you are setting up your new save.

There are consistent updates that actually add major features and improve the game, and this has been going on for a long time already. As it is an alpha, there are some bugs, which are actually being fixed. But aside from that, on to the game itself.\n\nPlayers in Prison Architect are set to manage a prison, which as the name implies they get to design themselves. Once the facility is constructed, in part or completely - Your choice, the player can allow in prisoners and manage day to day operation. Arrange for the prisoner's schedules for when they work, eat, sleep and so on. But keep in mind, the prisoners don't want to stay in prison. Some may not try it unless you just plain allow them to walk out the front gate, but others are more active about their attempts to escape or make life suck less. They arrange for tools and drugs to be thrown in over your outer walls, they take knives from the kitchen if they can get to them, and they'll try to dig tunnels to get out.\nSpecial attention is to be paid to the possibility of a riot. Prisoners can decide to start taking over, they can raid the armoury, knock down guards to take their stuff, or kill eachother. They aren't friendly people, most of the time.\n\nAnd you need to make sure they don't fall right back into their criminal habits after they're released.\nTeach them carpentry, send them to a basic education, treat their addictions...And make sure they don't think of your prison as a comfy hotel, it's not a vacation for them, it's a punishment.\nTime for the sentences appears to pass at a rate of one year per ingame day, and while this may not sound like it will have prisoners last long enough to do anything, many of them are in for 20 or more years, and some may show up with part of their sentence already done.\n\nYour income, as money does not grow on trees, comes from a few sources. A basic daily income, plus an income per prisoner, and income from the workshop. When you're teaching these prisoners a skill, you may as well profit from it, but of course, not all of them are bright enough to be able to learn workshop safety classes.\nI have mentioned money does not grow on trees, but that was only partially correct. The trees are money, as the wood is cut into boards and sold, or taken to the advanced carpentry stations for prisoners to create furniture out of. While probably not intentional, you can play Logging Station Architect instead. You just never take any prisoners and just plant trees to sell the logs. It's a slow way of earning money, and it is not anywhere near as fast or satisfying as running a prison, but the option is there. You can also sell off a prison you already made and use the money to start a new one, which allows you to continue playing the sold prison as well, though you can only sell it once.\n\nThe graphics may take some getting used to, but they fit the game and make things easy enough to see what is going on and where things are. The graphics aren't bad, but they aren't shiny 3d models as most games use these days.\n\nIn the end, Prison Architect is a great management/prison simulation game with great support by a great developper, and I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in management or simulation style games","December 16, 2014","true","176.8"," 50 of 54 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","50","54","0","0"

If you are familiar with any tycoon games, the formula is very similar. Build a prison and it's facilities, get prisoners, micro manage everything, rinse, wash and repeat. That being said though Prison Architect, like many games of it's genre, never gets old. It is always fun to experiment with new designs and features (which are constantly being implimented) and to see how your prisoners react to them. Not to mention, the game is incredibly polished for an alpha. I would reccomend this even if the current build was the full game.

Sometimes they will just start riots and kill all your dogs. Sometimes they will kill all your cooks and then riot because they are hungry. Sometimes they will dig an escape tunnel from Solitary all the way back to their cells, because you gave them a bookshelf. Other times they will just set fire to things.\n\nWhen they are not doing such, you can build them classrooms and hire teachers for them to murder. You can setup yards, give them jobs around the prison, learn new tech and issue your guards with tasers and such devices that keep them alive slightly longer, when the prisoners break down all the carefully placed locked doors you spent time planning out thinking it was foolproof. Enjoy the hilarity of having every guard in your prison delivered to the morgue you built, and having to call in emergency services in riot gear to retake the prison.\n\nYou can also cut down trees for cash, make prisoners into slaves that build furniture, and generally rip off the taxpayer with 'grants' that give you thousands for nothing, just like real life prisons.\n\nThis game is excellent.","June 22, 2015","true","107.1"," 42 of 43 people (98%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","98","42","43","30","0"

What can really be said about this game that hasn't already been said? It's an amazing tycoon game and I, daresay, the best Prison game I've ever played. The core concepts are simple, you build a prison with the intent on making money. You make money by accepting grants, getting more prisoners and having a bigger prison. With more inmates, comes more issues, thus requiring more money. Excess money is spent on research, salaries, expansion and general upkeep. You can build your prison however you want within the map size and I've seen some crazy prison layouts from other players (the Enterprise prison and automated prisons come to mind). They have even added in a campaign mode and you can take control of the inmates and bust out of the prison. This is a damn good game and I highly recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in Tycoon-esque games.\n\nWord of advice, don't leave any doors open and get metal detectors as soon as possible.\n\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNZOgsjK6vU","October 7, 2015","true","19.4"," 39 of 39 people (100%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","100","39","39","10","0"

In fact in some ways it's better.\n\nPA offers you the fun of building something, i.e. a prison, but with the details of running it as well, which you don't get with every game. You get to decide a lot more then some broad overviews of the world. You can deicde how everything works, when it works, cut cost, spend more, care for the prisoners — or don't it's up to you.\n\nThe game does have some issues, such as on MAC I don't see any of the proper icons/graphics when I play the game outside of SAFE mode. It loads into your save fast and then fromt here your fine. Occasionally something breaks in the game and the devs are fast to respond and deploy a fix or include it in the next update.\n\nPersonally this game could be released now, however I understand and don't want people to buy the game and it have some bugs and think that it was hald-♥♥♥♥♥ because of a a few minor problems.\n\nEDIT (3/13/2015): As the game has develoepd the features of the game have only gotten better, and more detailed. The Devs. tend to be pretty good about helping players fix any problems, even if it's a "Yes we know about it, and are working on it." kind of response, and I've found that means it's either coming in the next patch or major update.\n\nThere is also the constant addition and tweaking of the minor details one might want. Liek the ability to tell prisoners they can use this Yard area only, and not this one. To deploy gaurds, or to now add a library/chapel to your prison.","October 13, 2014","true","75.4"," 50 of 58 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","50","58","2","0"

Taking care of locking the scum of society away and setting them on the electric chair? *\n\nWell then Prison Architect is the game for you.\n\nBut the first few hours you play Prison Architect, you will be overwhelmed by it’s options and features. It has a very steep learning curve and currently no real tutorial that explains how every mechanic works. You are playing an Alpha.\n\nPrison Architect is exactly what you want it to be.\n\nDo you want to build a prison, where no one will ever break out of? Fine.\nDo you want to make your prisoners so angry that they will start a riot and flee once they get a chance? You can do that, too.\n\nYour prison is divided into different rooms. Each serves a special purpose. A cell to lock a prisoner away, a kitchen to cook food, and many more. It is your job to plan a layout and build those rooms, while managing your money and the needs of your prisoners. Those needs range from very easy to satisfy ones, like hygiene to ones that require special rooms to satisfy like clothing. Keeping up with the needs of your prisoners is the most important thing in a good prison, if you fail to do so you prisoners will eventually start a riot and injure or kill your staff.\n\n\nOnce you have run out of land to build on, you can either expand the land you own and your prison, or you can sell your current prison and start a new one with the value of your last prison added as bonus cash.\n\nSteam Workshop integration.\n\nIt is very easy to share your prison with the rest of Steam. Two clicks and you have either shared your prison or already downloaded others from the workshop.\n\nSo, where’s the catch?\n\nAs mentioned before Prison Architect is still in Alpha. And there are still bugs and performance problems with prisons that have 150+ prisoners, but almost every month a new  patch comes with fixes and new game mechanics.\n\n*It is currently not possible to execute prisoners.","December 20, 2013","true","58.0"," 54 of 65 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","54","65","0","2"

The game is as feature-rich as a complete product (moreso, if anything) and there are no game-breaking bugs.\n\nSo, what is it?Prison Architect is a nod back to the micro-management games of old (I'm avoiding the word 'tycoon' because that has become a hackneyed term to mean simplified 'make lots of money' cartoon game).  It's pure sandbox so don't let the first 'mission' put you off.  It did me (I didn't find it interesting) and didn't then play the game for a year or more, but that first mission is pure tutorial just to show you how the very simple tools work.  You are then left on your own with a blank canvas and all the tools you'll need for designing your own prison.\n\nHow complicated is it?It's not at all - but it can be if you want it to be.  It's genius in design for that.  You can be in the game and designing your own prison very quickly indeed without needing to be bogged down in all the minutiae of prisoner and roster management, but the beauty of the game is that, if you WANT that level of micro-management, you can.  You can set individual punishments and such for prisoners, but you don't have to.  You can schedule different daily timetables for each level of security prisoner so there are no clashes and inevitable riots, but you don't have to.  You can individually manage reform program scheduling, but you don't have to.  You get the idea.  The game automates all these things by default, but allows you to override them if/when you want to.\n\nOf course, getting a prison off the ground AND making money is that usual tycoon balancing act.  You have to start building foundations, but you can't go too large too soon otherwise you will be bankrupt overnight (and game over).  You can't expand one area too quickly (e.g. cells) unless you have the infrastructure in place to support them (bigger canteens, showers, and more utilities).  And not everything is available to you right away: you unlock  specialist staff and services as you go, providing a feeling of achievement on top of the creative aspect of the game.  The fun is in finding that balance and making your very own Alcatraz (or Reform Centre if you feel like being a benevolent architect).  The game scores you on the overall effectiveness of your prison (determined by how many riots and escapes you've had versus reformed and released prisoners unlikely to reoffend).\n\nIt's a PRISON game - how is that even fun?!Oh, but it is!  If you like designing and tweaking 'something', then this is your game.  Maybe you played Rollercoaster Tycoon, or Transport Tycoon, or even Simcity or Theme Hospital.  Bear in mind that it's pure sandbox (right now at least; I vaguely recall reading that missions might be added later but don't take my word for it).  You have a planning tool that will allow you to freeform-design your layout without committing any money, then build on top of your design after.  The fun is in creating a layout you want, and balancing it to make it work well (no good sticking a dining hall at the other end of the map if prisoners cannot reach it in their allotted mealtime slot).\n\nAbout that 'alpha' thing...Yeah, it's not even beta, but don't be fooled.  This is in a better state than any other beta game I've tried.  There are elements still to be finished (the execution chamber does nothing I believe, despite its appearance in the tutorial mission, and some things don't seem to have much effect on environment yet), but Introversion have been updating the game very regularly over two years.  I joined the alpha at its earliest stage and still the updates come.  Even if they didn't, this is a complete and playable game exactly as it is right now, and I have close to 160 hours recorded in the Steam version alone.\n\nMod supportThe game has an incredibly open mod support scheme and there are plenty of popular mods in the Steam Workshop right now.  I've tried the Women's Prison mod and it is easy to activate or deactivate each mod in the game.  An excellent design.  Of course, with the game changing periodically there is no guarantee that mods will continue to work for each iteration, but their easy removal means no worries.\n\nIn summaryPrison Architect is a game that most certainly doesn't feel like an alpha (or even beta).  Get past the somewhat awkward-feeling introductory mission and you have all the tools needed to design your own prison.  It's a micro-management sandbox simulator that's easy to get into, fun, and will inevitably sink far too many hours of your time!  Highly recommended, and a great example of crowd-funding at its absolute best.","December 13, 2014","true","469.2"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","40","44","0","2"

Although once you finished building your prison, that's pretty much it other than trolling your prisoners or play Escape Mode.\n\nAh yes, the Escape Mode is also my favourite aspect of the game (probably better than The Escapists) you get to play as an inmate and you can start ♥♥♥♥ing thing up in the prison including starting fights, set objects on fire, kill everyone (including visitors....even those who are under 13!

He's running along a path between two cell blocks, with a baton wielding guard in pursuit. As I pan the camera to follow the prisoner, I notice some activity at the front gate. A couple of workmen are carrying building materials for my latest construction project. The guard closest to the gate opens it to allow the workmen to enter, and I watch with a mixture of horror and embarrassment as the prisoner times his run perfectly to pass through the open gate, and out to freedom.\n\nThis anecdote perfectly illustrates everything you need to know about Prison Architect, the simulation game where the player has to build a prison and manage its day to day operations. The main sandbox game mode doesn't have a scripted story (there is a basic story in the tutorial mode), but there's lots of potential for each player to talk about unique events that happened to them. You'll spend alot of time discovering problems and figuring out how to fix them (I solved the above hole in my security by extending the outer fence and adding a second "inner" gate so that anyone coming in or out has to go through both gates). And unlike other management games, there's a constant feeling that your "customers" are actively trying to ruin all your hard work, and at any moment it could all burn down around you - literally.\n\nEach prisoner has a list of needs, such as sleep, food, hygiene, exercise, family and recreation. If you don't fulfil these needs, the prisoners will get angry and eventually start a riot. So you have to make sure you've got a big enough kitchen to keep everyone fed, build showers, hire janitors, give prisoners some yard time, let them meet family in a visitation room, and relax by playing pool or watching TV.\n\nAs you would expect, inmates will sometimes attack and kill each other, smuggle contraband and try to dig tunnels to escape. To combat this you can hire normal guards (equipped with batons, upgradeable to tazers) and armed guards (guns) and select which areas of the prison to deploy them. Guard dogs are good at sniffing out contraband and detecting tunnels. You can place CCTV cameras and metal detectors. In the event of a riot you can call in special riot police and firemen. Prisoners caught breaking the rules can be punished with solitary confinement.\n\nIf you choose to try to improve the lives of your prisoners, you can give them training so they can work in the kitchen, workshop, library or laundry. You can give them treatment for drugs and alcohol addiction in the infirmary, let them seek religion in a chapel or give them an education in a classroom. This all contributes to "reform" which influences the chance that they commit another crime after being released from prison. This "reoffend rate" is the closest thing the game has to an overall goal. The lower the rate, the better your prison is performing. Or you could just ignore the prisoners' well being and try to make as much profit as possible. The player has complete freedom to design their prison how they want.\n\nI do have some complaints. The tutorial campaign is quite basic, and there's alot of stuff that isn't explained. Once I started building my own prison from scratch in the sandbox I had to find answers to lots of questions on the forums. And the framerate starts to die when your prison gets quite large. My framerate was a constant 60 fps until I reached around 300 inmates, but now I've got 500 its just barely staying above 30 fps. Its still playable (framerate isn't as important for this kind of game as it is for a fast paced action game) but I'm not sure I want to go for the 1000 inmates achievement because I expect it would get even worse.\n\nOverall Prison Architect is a really fun, extremely deep game. There's a ton of more complex systems I've not even mentioned here, but at the same time its not overwhelmingly difficult to learn how to play. I definitely give a strong recommendation to Prison Architect. I've played almost 30 hours just doing the tutorial and building one prison, so there's easily enough playing time to justify a full price purchase.","October 20, 2015","true","41.9"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","37","40","5","0"

I think the Warden is trying to save a few bucks and cutting our food... which doesn't suprise me. Cell Block D has rioted 6 times in 4 days, and multiple guards and inmates die every day. The Chief placed more patrolls there than anywhere in the entire prison and it still does not work. There have been rumors today that the jail Lawyer is fighting off the feds, who are trying to close the prison down.    But today was different, we didn't hear any screams or gunshots. Everyone in my block looked to see if all of the inmates had died, but they all walked to the showers like normal. But then, everything wen't downhill FAST. We all stood up at the first gun shot. Everyone looked out of the doors but couldn't see anything. Then someone down the hall from me started breaking the door, along with everyone else in the block. I joined for this might be my chance to escape. After most of us broke the doors, we ran straight for the showers. I noticed that the other prisoners in different blocks had joined us. Everyone ran straight for the guards.   I looked around before running in, and could not belive my eyes. There were bodies everywhere, dead guards against the walls, prisoners beaten to death, and a few construction workers were lieing on the floor, bleeding everywhere. Then a gunshot made me jump. I looked up and saw a prisoner from my block with a shotgun from a guard he just killed with a drill... maybe from one of the workers. Then from one of the radios I heard the Police Chief give an order-  SHOOT TO KILL . Then the shots were fired. I looked up to see both Prisoners and Guards shooting each other, everyone dropping like rocks.    But wave 2 came. Prisoners from behind me came running with nothing to loose. Some were bleeding and some had stayed behind like I did. I rand with them right into the enemy.   After a few minutes I had gained a few scratches but was otherwise fine. Everyone came to a hault to realise that we had ended all of the guards lifes. The onslaugh did not wait though, people rushed, prisoners came running into the kitchen, and all you could hear was screaming. Then people ran into the office building. More gun shots were fired and more screaming was heard. I was sure that everyone had died. We heard sirens. Backup had arrived.   More armored guards and guards covered head to toe in kevlar came rushing in. I ran, I was not a killer but I did not wan't to get captured (Or killed). I turned into a hallway I had never been in before and looked around again. Dead cooks, janitors, construction workers, gardeners, medics, and of course- Guards. I rushed around another corner and there he was... the armed guard that ended my life.\n\nALL EVENTS CAN HAPPEN INGAME!

There are lot of bugs in the game which can be ignored since they don't affect the gameplay a lot.  You can buy the plot lands around you in case you want to expand your prison to be bigger (I prefer mine to be small, its easier to control).  I got the game on sale for like $10 which was a good price considering how expensive it is.  It's definitely worth your time playing, you'll be addicted watching your prisoners move around  or watch them get in a riot because you've been treating them badly (never had gotten a riot in my prison before.  I'm proud of myself).   I give the game a 9/10 since it still has bugs in it.  Buy it to support the developers they made a great game and its still being worked too!  Buy the game.

An early access game that not ONLY has relesed new versions on schedule for a long time, and now actually has reached version 1.0, is, sadly, something to celebrate on Steam.\n\nAside from the fact that the devs have used the Early Access platform the way it was meant to be used and that should be commended, it's also a pretty damned good managment game. Prison managment has been done before, but not for a long time, and never well, and it's a change of pace from the usual town managment sims. Now your "population" is the enemy, as well as your source of income.\n\nThe number of systems that works togheter to form the complete simulation is very impressive, and even a small change can shatter a very stable system. For example. I had a prison with 750 prisoners, running very smoothly. Then a gang leader arrived on the bus one morning and started organizing the red gang, one of the three gangs in my prison. I had never had a gang leader before so I let him work for a bit before sending him to my supermax facility, so I could experience how running a prison with an organized gang was like. In supermax he lost his temper, and ended up in solitary. This angered his gang enough that they started a riot. A couple of hours later when the dust settled and the riot police left there were 54 dead, over 60 injured, and 200 prisoners who were up for solitary for their actions during the riot. The rioting prisoners broke into protective custody, where snitches and former policemen who ended up in prison are kept, and killed half of the protected prisoners. I was put on notice, and risked ending up as a prisoner in my own prison. Luckily my lawyer got me out of that... A prison is a delicate system, and care needs to be taken when introducing anything new.\n\nThere is now added a story mode, to work as a guide for new players, and an escape mode, where you get to play as a prisoner, as well, but I still feel that the sandbox mode is the meat of the game. You learn some new tricks each time you build a new prison, and as you can sell your old prison for an extra cashboost in the startup phase of your next one, you will get more and more funds for each prison you build.\n\nMy only problem with the game is that it starts to lag when your prison grows too big, depending on how good your computer is. I first start to notice it at 750 prisoners and roughly 350 staff, so at just over 1000 individual characters present in the same prison, but my computer is pretty damned good. I know that a lot of people can't even get 500 prisoners to work well.\n\ntl:dr\nDamned good simulator/managment game. Buy it, play it, profit. A bit unforgiving if you make a mistake though, but that's the way in a prison.\nHighly recomended.","October 6, 2015","true","215.2"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","29","32","5","0"

Every Early Access update was a nice step forward, and the 1.0 release definitely feels like a complete game.\n\nBest thing about it, in my opinion, is that this game is incredibly balanced. You can be as harsh as you want, or build luxury suites for your drug dealers and murderers. You can build your favorite prisoner his own home and have staff bring his meals to him while he watches TV all day. All of these are valid playstyles, and will perform well on different metrics.\n\nThere are so many different game mechanics going on, but they're all intuitive, and the game's timescale control gives you all the time you need to figure out what to do. The campaign mode also breaks down a lot of the features one-by-one, which makes a great introduction to the game.","October 8, 2015","true","119.2"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","27","29","0","0"

But it does have it problems.\nI'll talk about what I love about it and then I'll talk about what I hate.\n\n1, Gangs.\n\nThe fact you can get gangs in your prison is great. They'll work together to escape and to kill/fight during a riot or skirmish.\nI find it perfect that I can section off gang members between cell blocks, And one day open up the doors and watch the murder spree insue, Before sending my armed guards set to free-fire in to crap on the resistance.\n\n2, Mods.\n\nWith this game you can see almost anything anytime with mods, I once had a mod that is sadly out of date now, Which set the base agression of the prisoners to near-riot at all times. Me moving one prisoner to another cell set off the entire prison into a rampage. Total death toll was over 400 prisoners, 300 guards and the 5 admins, Whom, Got rushed by gun-weilding gangs.\n\n3, Armed Guards.\n\nThe fact I can turn my prison into a DPRK Political Prison is just great. Putting guards in the canteena with free-fire on is possibly the best way to maintain order in my prisons while keeping the quality as low as it can possibly go. No janitors, No health care, NOTHING.\n\nThose were the things I like about this game, Time to get into the stuff I hate.\n\n1, Workers.\n\nThe workers get stuck far to often for their own good, It seriously calls into question what the level of education required for their field of work is. I once had about 50 workers stuck behind a wall, and 20 more in another. The sad thing is, When i tried to free them, The oposite set would be assigned to free the other. This lasted 20 mins before i hired 100 more.\n\nThey also have a tendency to shove their faces into the edge of the map once you buy a gate, Its annoying.\n\n2, Easy to trigger prisoners.\n\nNow, I did say before that I had a mod that triggered them, But it seems the mod is useless now, The prisoners in this game seem to be like their personality was taken straight from forums dedicated to complaints and petty ♥♥♥♥♥. The prisoners can be set off for litterally walking to far. Its rediculas when you have to kill half your prison beacuse they hate WALKING.\n\n3, Cell Quality.\n\nThis is a prison, Not a luxury hotel.

After spending some 10 hours or so on this Early Access title, I can't help feeling a bit divided about it.\n\nRight off the bat, the longing for a game like the good games of old, such as Theme Hospital, makes you feel right at home. The genre hasn't seen much since then, and that makes Prison Architect a very welcome sight. In my first sitting, I played 5 hours straight. Not a lot of games these days seem to be able to pull that off. Part of the reason behind this, I think, in addition to the mentioned longing, is the discovery of how things work. In fact, you are given very few hints about how to get started properly. There's a tutorial kind of thing, but it touches just a small part of the game (some which I read, are not even part of the game at this point).\n\nBut, as I keep playing the game and learning more about the workings, I can't help but feel that the game is a bit "fake". The speed of the game is rather slow, stretching play time more than necessary (even though there are speed controls available). Then there's the graphics, which are unimpressive, but you would be able to forgive if the gameplay is very good. It's just that the gameplay is very basic. There's very little complexity in it, and nothing very new. In addition, many things don't seem to work very well. The visuals are sub-par. There's no soundtrack. There's no cinematics or voice recordings. There's no campaign mode.\n\nEven considering these things, I could be very forgiving. However, for a game that has raised considerable funding of some $10.000.000 and been in alpha for over a year, I would expect more. I'm quite amazed they haven't gotten further. Even so, I do feel I got my 7€ worth.\n\nWould I recommend the game? It's a very tough question. I feel I can't quite discredit the game, but on the other hand, it's not very impressive. Another factor is the rather stiff regular price to consider. In sum, I would have to give it a thumbs down. However, you might find it very enjoyable, and eventually it might turn out to be something great. For most people, I would therefore suggest waiting and see how things turn out.\n\n2014.05.06: It would seem my review is a bit controversal. I just want to stress the fact that I like the game. I keep playing it. I just wish it was so much more, and I think it could have been. I'd like to commend the developers for Workshop support by the way. Usually that's an afterthought.\n\n2015.02.03: I'd just like to point out I haven't played the game for a while now. There has been some additions meanwhile. I don't have a good enough basis to say much about them. I suggest you look at the release announcements if you want more up-to-date information. I'd like to say, however, that my opinion of the game hasn't changed much.","May 1, 2014","false","30.5"," 1,032 of 1,771 people (58%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","58","032","1","20","88"

You start with an empty plot with workers and some money that you use to build mandatory buildings like offices for Warden and prison cells. Game itself is not really hard, so even if you make a lot of mistakes on your first run you will be fine. Art style and prisoner varieties are endless, prisoners can have special good and bad attributes that can make them faster, deadlier or even more likely to be killed by other prisoners or guards, to fight these you can employ guards that can either be armed with a more powerful gun or a K-9 until by their side or make the prison swarmed by CCTV cameras. Another interesting mechanic is that you can employ prisoners to do stuff janitor or chief does or you can use them as a manpower in workshop so you would earn additional money. In short, the bigger your prison is you will face more problems.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/233450/\n═══════════════════════════════════PROS & CONS\nPros:Lovely art style\nPrison sound effects\nPrisoner variety and attributes that will make your life harder\nIncludes everything you can think about when you say "prison"\nPrisoners may form gangs that fight together\nMany community-made prisons\nYou can play as a prisoner and:Make your own gang\nGain reputation\nSteal things\nBecome stronger and add attributes to yourself\nTry to escape your own prisonmuch more!Cons:If your prison become too big you will face lags\nThere are some bugs around building foundations\nRarely prisoners may stuck themselves\nConnecting stuff by wires is unexplained and new players may face difficulties with it═══════════════════════════════════SUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nThis game is for everyone that loves management games like SimCity and wants everything to be perfect in their "masterpiece".

You will experience the same urge that something like the Civ series will give you, except "just one more turn" becomes "just one more room/building". Once I had begun the third iteration of my prison with $500k in funds, the fun was really getting started as I had the ability to build what I wanted instead of what I had to do to get by.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nOnce my budding prison complex reached ~175 prisoners, I noticed something; the frame rate had begun to drop.. Surely this game with its 2D sprites wasn't slowing my gaming rig down...or was it? By 250 prisoners I was down below 30 FPS.\n\nUpon further inspection, it wasn't just the FPS that had dropped; the actual pace of the game seemed to be tied to the frame rate. What was 3x game speed had now slowed to a stuttering 1x game speed. A quick search of the internet revealed the root cause of the issue (and that I was far from alone).\n\nPrison Architect is a processor-heavy game. This is expected and normally not a problem; there are a lot of things happening at once when you reach the point where 500 entities are "thinking" and moving simultaneously in your game world. However, what IS a problem is the fact that Prison Architect only runs on one of your processor's cores, with no hyperthreading. The 3.0 GHz eight core beast sitting in the case next to me might is about as useful as the Celeron in grandma's laptop. This means that EVERYONE who plays this game, regardless of their rig's power, is going to experience the same slowdown once they get to ~200 prisoners - which is RIGHT when the game has sucked you in and you are ready for the long haul.\n\nPrison Architect is insanely fun. I spent roughly 16 of the last 48 hours playing it. Unfortunately, it's so poorly optimized that it will eventually become virtually unplayable if I continue to feed my new addiction.\n\nI cannot recommend Prison Architect to anyone in its current state. The developers should be ashamed of themselves for letting this issue exist for so long. If things change in the future, I will edit my review.\n\nEdit: After 4 months and 4 more updates to the game, this is still unfixed.","January 2","false","43.6"," 101 of 166 people (61%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","61","101","166","11","4"

Unfortunately, it isn't multi-core capable and will only use two threads. This results in significant FPS and simulation speed decreases as the number of agents increases.\n\nMy current prison - which I'm stubbornly completing despite it having become a major chore - holds 300 prisoners, employs around 350 staff, has slowed down to around 12-15 FPS and a proportional simulation speed decrease while idle, and a nigh unplayable 5-6 FPS while building my next cell block of 100 cells. System: i7 5930k, @2800MHz RAM.\n\nTo put things into perspective: There are achievements for holding 500 and 1'000 prisoners respectively. The achievement here being patience and a tolerance for slideshows, of course.\n\nWhich brings me to my next, and final point. As other games have proven, it's perfectly possible to have an agent based simulation maintain a smooth, stable simulation speed for most of the game's situations even without multi-core capabilities. The trick is to have a difficulty-induced softcap on the total number of agents the system has to handle. In PA, it's ridiculously easy to keep hundreds (or thousands) of prisoners' needs fulfilled. Once you have the money to build all the necessary facilities, you would need to purposely mismanage your prison for anything "interesting" like riots to have a chance of happening. If it weren't for the need to occasionally and manually check for and remove tunnels, or watch out for tagged snitches among new arrivals, you could run the game on full autopilot for days and the only thing that would have changed once you return would be your account balance.\n\nPrison Architect has (had) a lot of potential, but sadly, I cannot recommend it in its current state (A sentiment that should be reserved for Early Access reviews). Stay away from this (for now) unless you plan on only building tiny prisons, have a lot of patience, don't mind slideshows and screen tears, or have hypothreaded your CPU down to two virtual cores.","January 15","false","141.1"," 41 of 62 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","41","62","4","0"

Seriously, can anyone explain to me why this game is so bloody addicting? Why I keep finding myself migrating back and starting over on a whole new map? I can't put my finger on what it is about Prison Architect that engrosses me so much.\n\nYou're building a prison. You can design it however you like. Make the new Alcatraz; or create a low-security retreat for minor offenders, or a prison from hell for murderes and thieves. Will you build a labyrinth of terror from which they'll never escape (unless it's to the execution chamber) or will you develop a cutting-edge rehabilition center full of cats, books, and life-skills classes? It's up to you.\n\nTL;DR You build a prison. Wall, rooms, utilities. Then you fill it with prisoners, and try to keep things running smoothly, with the amount of money you have. Pretty standard.You can turn on/off rules (endless money, oh yeah!) and pause prison intake if things are getting a little too difficult.

It only took me an week to escape/destroy my prison. My weapon of destruction was a lighter!\n- I wondered the prison during it's hour-long freetime session and I sneaked an office with the help of am ingnorant guard who willingly let me into it and I founded an lighter.\n-The next day I was trying to dig myself tunnel to escape through when an guard noticed what I was doing, so I ran out of my cell and was chased by a group of them with one of the armed guards. I used the lighter to attack one of the guards and the armed guard started shooting. Quickly, I started hitting him with it and he dropped his shotgun.\n-I didn't know whether not I could use the shotgun, but I took the risk and actually picked it up. I started firing and moments later other prisoners were fighting the guards as well until a riot rosed up. I killed the guards with only two shots of the gun and then riot police came in.\n-With the help of other prisoners who helped me take out two more armed guards and they took their shotguns, holding the riot police at bay long enough to where the floor was covered in the bodies of the police. I wondered off to see if the lighter worked while they were fighting and I set an huge fire that engulfed most of the prison (by lighting a lot of things on fire).\n- I along with some other guys fled to southern staff hall of my prison, breaking through the staff doors to escape through the southern prison gate. The two armed prisoners managed to shoot down a lot of riot guards, I even took an screenshot if anyone wants to see.\n- I managed to escape from my prison with luck, though I don't know what was the fate of those armed prisoners.\n\nHope you guys like my story, escape mode is rather hard depending on the prison. I only got lucky that I started an riot when I got that shotgun. I recommend this game because of that mode.","October 6, 2015","true","166.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","12","12","5","0"

Yey. Build buildings and rooms that are used for various purposes all to make your prison... however you want, actually. After moving beyond the premise that you are building this unpleasant place, the game gives you significant amounts of freedom to choose what sort of unpleasant place it is. Will you make a rehabilitation center with classrooms, gardens, and plentiful opportunities to help your inmates? Or will you make an abyssal hellhole of concrete, armed guards, and abusive authority? You can make both in this game, and everything in between. As far as simulations go, the sort of creative freedom this game offers the player is exactly what all games of this genre ought to have. You can adjust everything from deciding what your prisoners do each hour of the day, the types of inmates you have in your prison, to what sort of punishments you deal out when those convicts decide to do something naughty like punching the cooks or trying to dig an excape tunnel through their toilet (eww!). There are nearly an endless amount of possibilities! :o\n\nIt's still in Early Access, but the game is very playable right now. I'm looking forward to seeing what else they will add, because what the game already has is excellent. Even if this game is apparently unfinished, you can still have lots of fun with it as you create the jail of your... choosing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kelesis666/recommended/233450/","Kelesis666","Paikia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kelesis666/","605 products in account",""Prison Architect" is a business simulation game, except in this case, the business is a prison, which brings a few more factors into the equation, in addition to the base principle of income-outcome ratio. The name "Prison Architect" might be a little misleading, though, as the game is not just about building and planning the prison, but also about running it, managing it, and keeping everything in balance. You're not just the architect, you're also the warden.\n\nWhile there's nothing really fancy about the graphics or the music of the game, the gameplay mechanics are where it shines. As architect/warden, you have to find the optimal balance between the financial limitations and the needs of the prisoners. The fact that we're dealing with prisoners makes everything even more interesting, as unlike the standard business manager or city builder, your "customers" are criminals and your job is to make sure they serve their punishment, as decided by the court. Should a convicted murderer have access to a TV? Should a convicted child molester be able to play pool? Those are just some of the moral dilemmas the game brings to your door.\n\nAfter clocking over 200 hours, I can say with confidence that at least according to my taste, the gameplay mechanics are very well balanced, and make this game one of my all time favorites.\n\nHaving that said, I must also mention what I consider to be the game's one major flaw, which is the lack of optimization. I have decent hardware (Quad-core i7, 16GB RAM and a Geforce GTX465), which handles much heavier and at least as complex games very well. I see no good reason for a game like Prison Architect to lag on such hardware (on prisons with 500 prisoners or more), while games like Civilization: Beyond Earth and Cities: Skylines run smoothly, aside from lack of optimization by the developers.\n\nAll in all, I consider Prison Architect to be a great game, a must for any fan of the genre.","February 11","true","287.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I bet they didn"t know what they where in for by messing with me. They disrespected MY prison, I kindly shut down the power and water and locked it down until half of them had died, and the remaining decided to riot. The riot ended quickly though, especially when the government stepped in and took my prison away from me, and killed the prisoners that were involved in the riot. Would I reccomend this game? YES!

There are so many things you can build, change, add, etc... even during the end parts of the game where you have built a massive prison with every aspect of the game included in your prison, there are always problems that need fixed and things need changed.\n\nThe Negatives\n*I don't want to be a fanboy here, but I can't think out of the top of my head any negatives to this game.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n*Prison Architect is a great game with amazing developers.

I just wanted to point out that after a year of playing they have added tons of new features. Cool. However they have not been able to make proper guard AI.\nWhy skip something so essential to do things that you don't really need?\nTypical big-studio way of working, and that's exactly why I bought an Indie game. Because I want it to work properly. The other 95% of the game is still amazing, but working guards are extremely essential. This is also the reason I haven't been playing anymore. No real use if the entire game comes down to luck.\n\nI'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they will fix it, but if this is not fixed by time of release this gets a negative recommendation.\n\n--\n\nIt's all been said before, it's the best tycoon-ish game ever made and the prisoner behavior is very realistic. You can build a 300 people prison or you can build a small cosy hippie prison with reform programs and make sure everybody is in a healthy state of mind. Going big and right-wing will be rewarded with money and going small and hippie will be rewarded with very subtle visual clues that tells you about an inmates substance abuse problem and a low re-offending-percentage.\n\nOh yeah one thing to keep in mind. At this point in the development it's quite easy to build a 150 man peaceful LowSec prison. But building MaxSec prisons is still quite hard for me after 180 hours. I've made some that work and I've made some that were hellholes and I'm not a 100% sure yet what the big difference was. It's not as easy as the Tycoon games of the 90's.\n\nOh yeah one more thing... Big prisons are very demanding on your computer and you'll need 80 guards if you want 40 patrols. Not because they need so much rest, but because you have to put extra guards everywhere because they do not wait untill they are relieved of their duty by a colleague before they split. So sometimes you think you have 5 men patrolling in a yard but suddenly 3 walk away and you got a Fight on your hands. And of course every extra moving entity in your prison is more CPU usage. So for the majority of us a huge prison is nearly impossible because of the chaos and the CPU usage. Guard, Dog and Workman AI has some other big problems too like sometimes they refuse to lay pipes for absolutely no reason and Guard Dog's keep biting unconscious inmates untill their dead, lowering the value of your prison (temporarily but still). But building a 100 person prison is a lot of fun too and I'm guessing within half a year it should be possible for everybody to build a big functional stable MaxSec prison. The state of the game is much better then most Early Access games I´ve played.","November 28, 2014","true","248.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

What? Need a tutorial? Sure, here's how you build a house, build utilities, hire people, designate rooms, execute people etc.. What? Oh, the rest of the stuff? Don't worry about that, you'll learn the meaning and the use of it just seconds after you fu*k something up!"\n\nSo... It's a prison builder. You would think that there would be nothing really to do, other than boss around the inmates, but you are wrong. IVSoftware has made it really, REALLY detailed. And they make you care about your prisoners, especially if you have less ~50 prisoners. This game allows you to manage prisons in the way YOU want, with YOUR political or ethical standarts. And that is what a sandbox should be: the ability to express your creations the way you want and not be forced to do otherwise.\nHas great mod support and a growing community to make sure, that, even if you somehow get bored, you will be able to find something new to try out. But that is also a negative. After 8-12 hours I have done everything: completed the campaign, built a functioning prison with 300+ prisoners, played the "Escape" mode (which is a LOT of fun at first, but after like your third or fourth prison, each new prison becomes a speedrun on "How fast can I break the shower heads and toilets, stirl up a riot, grab a shotgun and run out". But, as it's only found in the "Extras" section, I believe, that this bare-bone mode is not finished yet, despite the game being released). All that's left is to find those meaningless photos and notes, in which I can't figure out the handwriting.\nAll and all, this is a great sandbox and the price is fairly cheap for a game, that gives content for atleast a day, plus mods, plus replayability with different playing styles. I rate the game with an 8/10- a MUST try-out, with a potential of stealing tens or even hundreads of hours, depending on your taste.","October 12, 2015","true","36.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","10","11","3","0"

I'd probably give this about a 7.8/10, to be honest, which is solid for $29.99, but is a steal if you can get it cheaper.\n\nNow to the rationale for my decision:\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nGOOD :\n\nYou can play it on a simple level, or on a complex one, and it remains just as fun. If you enjoy sitting and connecting up elaborate electronic doors, CCTV cameras, and making the most efficient-yet-safe use of space as possible while trying to never have an escape or death, you can do so and find it a genuine challenge. Or, alternatively, you can turn failure conditions and events off, use old-school patrol-planning and little else, and even give  yourself unlimited funds.\n\nAnd the prisoners behave in ways where you can act simply, or really think things through. At first blush, it seems so simple as to why a prisoner kills someone. But if you get informants and look at info, you'll notice that murders occur more often for pretty logical reasons: victim is an ex-cop or snitch... murderer has a violent reputation... murderer was dissatisfied with several of their needs (hygiene, nutrition, etc.). You can ignore all this and just beef up security in general and take 30 seconds just to re-route a patrol and add a guard, or you can form a protective-custody cell block that is more isolated and start putting snitches and other prime-targets in there away from the Max-security cons.\n\nAnd you have the logistical tools to actually do all this... you can set individual schedules for each security-level, lay down specific patrol routes, assign certain blocks to be used only by certain groups of prisoners, and hire staff that conduct reform programs.\n\nIt's a lot of fun, and you can pick how you want to play. And in the mean time, you can go around clicking on prisoners to see what ridiculous things they did to end up in prison. Great fun.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nBAD :\n\nThere *are* issues, however.\n\nMy main gripe is that too many toys are locked behind tech unlocks. Which at first sounds like SimCity, another game where the neat special buildings have to be unlocked and even then you have to wait a painful amount of time to build them (here, too, money comes in pretty slowly). But here the issue is worse, because I feel like really, *really* basic things are too expensive simply to unlock:\n\nWhy do I need to unlock being able to assign patrol routes?\nWhy do I need to unlock being able to take out a loan? (though grants do exist for building specific things)\nWhy do I need to unlock janitors and gardeners?\n\nAnd as far as I know, even if I play with unlimited funds, I *still* have to manually unlock these things, which don't just unlock with the push of a button but take time. And, similarly, there's no option for insta-build... if I play with no failure conditions and unlimited funds, why not also allow me to build things instantly rather than having to hire 50 workers and wait for my mega-prison to be built over the course of real-life hours, hours that are added on to whatever time it took to actually lay out everything for them to build?\n\nThese are fairly minor issues in my opinion, and the Steam Workshop is a great place to go for some pre-built prisons, but doing that takes some of the fun out of building it yourself. Yet when building huge prisons, building it yourself takes you a while to give all the build orders, and then even longer to actually see the place be built. Which is fine when going for realism, but when I want a sandbox mode experience, it slows things up.\n\nReally, this game needs a full-out sandbox mode where I can build instantly, rather than just a couple of options that sort of approximate a sand-box mode.\n\nAgain, not nearly a big enough issue to really hamper the fun for long, but does make it hard to experiment with designs numerous times unless you stay a bit smaller in scale.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nAND THE UGLY:\n\nTooltips and info are really, really sparse for this game. The info is all there, really, but sometimes it's in a place where you might not think to look, or is so briefly covered that a bit of clarification would have been helpful.\n\nRight away, you assign reform programs, but it says no time is scheduled for them. But it doesn't say *why*. So you have to go to the scheduler (under Regieme) and hover over 'Work' to find out that reform programs don't have their own slot but occur during 'Work' time for anyone who isn't working. Which is already obscure, but what's worse is that you don't have an intuitive need for 'Work' time until you unlock 'Prison Labor'... so you might have already removed the default 'Work' time slot prior to deciding your unruly cons need some reform programs. It's a mess, and one that could easily be avoided if it said on the 'Programs' screen that your reform programs aren't scheduled because there is no 'Work' time slot (rather than just saying there's no time scheduled for them).\n\nAnd similar issues, though not always to this scale, exist elsewhere. When a room needs furniture to function, the game tells you exactly what you need... but when the room fails to function because an escape tunnel entrance is in it (mostly in cells), it doesn't tell you this. Which is an issue because the tunnels can sometimes be partially underneath some other sprite in the game, usually a bit of debris a work left in the cell after not throwing out the dummy left in the bed,\n\nIt's an issue that goes away once you play a bit and learn the ropes, but it's an unnecessary learning curve that could be removed by including just a little more info here and there.\n\nThe other 'ugly' issue is that a few sprites are unclear as to what is forward and what is backward. TVs, Radios, and garbage bins look surprisingly the same whether looking at back or front. This isn't a graphics issue so much as it is a design issue... the TV screen looks like the TV's back CRT area. Just make the screen blue and white and keep the back part black. It's not an issue for too many objects,  but there are a few where just a slight change of color would distinguish the back from the front.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nOVERALL:\n\nIt's part SimCity, part 'Tycoon', and part 'The Sims Go To Prison'. If you want your convict-sims to be able to kill each other daily, you can make it happen, and if you want a genuine challenge to keep them healthy and alive, you can make that happen, too.\n\nIf you're into any of the three games mentioned above, I'd recommend this.\n","October 13, 2015","true","31.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The only thing protecting you is a small green door that could easily be broken down in a matter of seconds?\n\nThis is the case of Officer BlackLady (BL for short).\n\nThe prison was running smoothly on a fine sunday afternoon, all was calm. The prisoners had just gotten off of their three hour work period and were going on a break for lunch. BL and the other staff members chit chat in the cafeteria, but BL steps out to use the ladies room. In the cafeteria, all the prisoners line up to get their daily slop. The newest inmate (lets call him Brick), sits down to eat his meal. He goes to reach for the salt, but as he goes to pour, the lid pops off and all the salt pours onto his meal, ruining it.\n\n"Who the ♥♥♥♥ did this..."\n\nBrick's salt levels reached an all time high, never before had anyone seem this form of salt. He leaned over to a snickering inmate, and ripped him in half. His blood spilled onto the ground as the other inmates look on in terror. One of the guards attempts to subdue him, only to be pummeled to the ground.\n\nThis display started the unforgettable riot.\n\nThe entire cafeteria exploded into a hellish war zone of flying fists and meat chunks. The guards were all blitzed and had all their weapons taken. Some were brutally beaten into an unconcious state, while others had their heads dipped into the boiling pots of water. They prisoners exploded out of the cafeteria in a hellish manner, inciting others to join the riot. Within minutes the entire prison was being overrun by prisoners with tons of illegal contraband either stolen in the raid or hidden from earlier points.\n\nOn her way back to the cafeteria, BL saw the riot, and quickly took shelter in the infirmary. There, she saw all the patients assaulting the doctors who were working, some being stabbed in the neck with syringes and others being gutted by scalpals and knives. One young doctor (lets call her Cherry), was being cornered by one especially unruly inmate. BL jostled him down, grabbing Cherry and rushing her into the morgue for safety. They locked the doors behind them, turned off the lights, and hid in a corner, hoping nobody would see them.\n\nThe riot went on for what seemed like hours, hundereds of guards were murdered, multiple prisoners escaped, even the cooks and janitors were gutted and hung out to dry in the yard. BL and Cherry were the only two survivors in the onslaught. After the noise calmed down, BL looked out of the window to see the horrid landscape. Bodies laid in the yard. Prisoners and Guards alike. Other prisoners simply walked over their bodies, carrying weapons and looking for any survivors.\n\nBL knew that some of the more insane prisoners would stay behind, waiting for backup to arrive, just to claim more lives and shed more blood. These were the sick and the deranged, the ones locked up in the basement always forgotten about.\nShe gave Cherry her gun, told her to use the emergency phone to call for help if she didn't return, grabbed her baton and stun gun, and exited the morgue, locking the door behind her. She carefully snuck around the prison looking for anyway for her to safely get Cherry out of the prison. As she turned the corner to the cafeteria, she was ambushed from behind. As she fell to the floor, she whipped out her tazer and electrocuted the man on top of her. Pushing him off she made a dash for the exit, hoping to find someway to save Cherry afterwards. As she turned each corner, she could hear the roars increasing behind her of prisoners out for blood. She bolted out the front doors and headed for the hole in the fence to freedom. With each step she heard them closing in. 20 meters. 10. 5. "Almost there" - she said to herself. Only three yards from the hole, she was tackled to the ground. She tried to fight off the inmate, but was quickly surronded. It was no use, she was dead. The prisoners began their assault, kicking and punching her. The life was about to leave her body when she heard the gun fire. A prioner dropped dead at her side. The back up SWAT team finally arrived, and swiftly shot down all the prisoners. They grabbed BL and brought her into the back of their van. She told them about Cherry, before finally falling unconcious.\n\nWhen she awoke, she was in the hospital, Cherry sitting at her side. On the TV she saw that the prison had finally been secured once more, but the body count was in the thousands. BL looked over to Cherry and smiled. That was when the knife had entered her gut. She looked down to see the blood, and looked back up at Cherry. That was when she remembred, the hospital had a psych ward attatched to the infirmary. Cherry was no doctor, she was an insane inmate looking for a way out. And now that BL was dead, there would be no loose ends.\n\nCherry walked out of the hospital, bloody knife in hand, and walked off into the sunset.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrison Architect 10/10\nWould ruin my own prison again.","November 5, 2015","true","64.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","85","11","13","10","0"

Whilst I’m sure that would be incredibly popular with the criminal types, even I can see that it’s an insane idea.\nThen there are crimes of passion, insanity and cruelty to be taken into account, but what is the cost effective solution?\nThere’s always the option of the death penalty, that would help keep the costs down but it is a little on the permanent side, although with regards to re-offenders, the record excellent!\n\n\nDesigner Pen... itentiary\n\nWhether the prisoner is going to be walking “The Green Mile” or not, they’re still going to need somewhere to stay whilst they’re in custody, not to mention facilities, food etc. Then there’s the man power required to keep the infrastructure ticking over.\n\nSomeone’s got to cook the food, keep the facilities running and most importantly, make sure that the prisoners behave themselves and don’t do anything inconvenient like escape.\n\nWhen you think about it, there’s a lot of resource management involved.\nBefore you even open the doors to the wrong do'ers, you need to worry about the design and construction of the prison itself with its own costs and complications.\n\n\nPlay Pen...  itentiary\n\nWith the design aspects, people management and juggling of resources, it’s a concept that would make a pretty interesting game and that’s where Prison Architect an early access title in development by Introversion Software comes in.\n\n\nClean Slate\n\nIt seems that the adage “Build it and they will come” doesn’t just apply to baseball fields but prisons too.\nYou’ll start the game with a patch of land and a bus load of prisoners already on their way to check in.\nIt’s time to get building.\n\n\nFixtures and Fittings\n\nThe first thing you’ll need to do is recruit a prison governor, who’s going to need an office, so you’re going to need to design and build that. He’ll probably want some luxuries like a desk and chair in his office too, maybe even a window and a filing cabinet, but all these things cost money.\n\nYou should probably have a few prison guards to keep the convicts in line when they arrive.\n\nThe guards are going to expect a staff room to relax in; somewhere they can sit and eat their sandwiches whilst watching re-runs of prison break, so you can add some chairs and a TV to the shopping list too.\n\nThe TV isn’t going to work without electricity so a generator is a must, then you’ll need to lay down power cables and maybe running water isn’t just a luxury either, time to call the plumbers.\n\n\nOversite\n\nSo your plot of land has now turned into a construction site, the prison bus is nearly here and we’re missing something vitally important. A place to put the prisoners!\n\n\nAll in it Together\n\nYou almost certainly don’t have the time or the resources left to build a wing of prison cells; hopefully a large holding cell will do for now, all the prisoners will just have to be squashed into the one communal room when they get here.\nPerhaps we’ll spoil them and throw in a bench or two for them to sit on and a toilet for them to...  err... sit on too.\n\n\nAnother Brick in the Wall\n\nYou might want to place some prison walls whilst you’re at it, just in case one of your guests decides to make a break for it.\nIt seems the honour system doesn’t work that well with regards to prisoners trying to escape.\n\n\nFresh Meat\n\nSo the prison bus has pulled up outside and your newly employed prison guard is leading the “fresh meat” to the holding cell, but there’s no rest for the wicked.\nYou’re going to need showers, a kitchen, an exercise area, a cook for the kitchen, etc. and some corridors and security doors to join it all up.\n\n\nFamily & Friends\n\nThere will be another bus load of prisoners along soon enough and now you’ve got your first batch of orange jump suited guests, you’re going to get family members wanting to visit them.\n\nIt’s best they don’t see their loved ones all crowded around the one communal toilet in the holding cell, so it’s time to think about getting the contractors back on site to construct a visitors building too.\n\n\nI Predict a Riot\n\nThere is always something to think about in Prison Architect, something new will always need building, improving or changing.\n\nYou’ll need to employ and manage staff, from physiatrists through to janitors.\nYou’ll need to build a host of different room types, along with connecting hallways, you’ll also need to think about where you want security doors and cell doors positioned, because sooner or later there will be an escape attempt.\n\nIf conditions in your prison deteriorate too much your inmates will riot, if they capture or kill one of your prison guards, they could well steal his keys, giving them access to unexpected places and likely lead to the death of more staff, still there’s always the national guard to help restore order.\n\n\nThe View from the Top\n\nThe top down graphics are crisp and the tubby little characters that waddle around the prison in orange jump suits are cute, the simple art style on show here is surprisingly endearing and certainly helps alleviate what could be quite an oppressive atmosphere, I guess orange really is the new black.\n\n\nBusy Hands\n\nI stated earlier that there’s always something to think about whilst playing the game and this is true, but after you’ve been playing for long enough, things will start to feel repetitive. Build more cells, hire more guards etc.\n\nIt can all start to feel a little samey in the late game when you’re prison is fully built and the only challenge left is to trying to squash a relentless influx of convicts into your increasingly overcrowded prison.\n\nIt’s also important to keep in mind that at the time of writing Prison Architect is an early access game.\n\nHaving said that, it’s been in early access for a while now and most of the bugs have already been ironed out. It feels like a pretty complete title and one which I’ve enjoyed serving time with.\n\n\nVoyeuristic Micromanager Wanted!\n\nDespite still being in early access, Prison Architect is a perfectly playable, absorbing and rewarding simulation, whether you’re the creative type looking to design your own penitentiary perfection, a voyeur looking to watch little fat inmates waddle around prison or just want to wrap yourself up in a blanket of micromanagement, you’re going to find something to enjoy in Prison Architect.\n\nA crime is committed every 5 seconds in England, another prison bus is on its way...\n\n\nFor the full review and others please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com","April 11, 2015","true","16.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","8","9","4","0"

Don't know how it got in there but whatever, later I put him in Supermax and executed him because no man should ever be murdered in the comfort of a warm and bubbly shower. (and because I was testing the feature)\n\nOn a more serious note, I think I entered the alpha in Alpha 2 or 3 and from here, its progressed on a lot. Prison Architect is a fun cartoonish style management sim but with a twist. Every riot, murder, assualt, escape attempt, and execution brings you a step closer to building a more perfect prison. Yes, it's just only been released but its background has come a long way and the developers are very engaging with the community which really can't be found in the Gaming design industry. I applaud Introversion for their hardwork and dedication to bring about such a great prison sim.\n\nGod it sounds terrible talking about a Prison simulator, but deep down, we all want to lock someone up lol.","October 6, 2015","true","110.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","8","9","6","0"

Reviews were all delightfully outstanding. Figured 9,000 odd reviews can't be a company ploy to get you to purchase the game, so figured I would give it a shot.. Commenced downloading..\n\nDay one, download complete, 6.00pm - Started out on the game, completed the tutorial, found the interface, and abilities somewhat endless. Once I sussed out the way foundations worked (easy if you follow the tute) I was building en'mass in the creative mode where money is endless! Dealing with prisoners, throwing the lockdown alarm and searching cells, creating new buildings and solitary confinement, setting the meal plans and daily schedule, deploying response teams and patrols, what an amazing game! - Holy Crap, what's this in the extras, MODS!? Holy crap look at the fancy stuff I can have at the (free) click of a button via the mods page, how amazing! Let's build more!\n\nDay two, 11 hours later, 5.00am, meant to be at work in an hour, where the hell did all night go!? - Holy crap this game is sweet! I'm late for work!

I'm not sure how many times I've sold off my current prison to start another because the layout that I had build wasn't "quite right". The different objects, rooms and game difficulties mean there are a lot of different options and setups to keep gameplay interesting after your first prison.\n\nThere's a lot of experimentation to do in terms of how you deal with prisoners, how many staff to have, where to deploy them etc. The game's main sandbox mode allows you to turn off the failure conditions too, so you can even purposely run a terrible prison just to see what happens!\n\nI didn't personally get into the escape mode. Not because it's bad, it just didn't really have any appeal for me because it's completely different from the prison building aspect of the game - but it is definitely worth a go.\n\nOverall, the game has a lot of depth for what is essentially "prison tycoon", and will definitely be one of my "go-to" games in the future.","April 11","true","94.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I won't write a review like this game is perfect, especially when it's still in development, but it was pretty fun.\n\nThis seems like a cartoonish game but it's actually pretty graphic. Just in the tutorial alone there's already sex and murder in some pretty good artwork (so props to the artist for shocking everyone). I did think this would just be a fun cartoonish game at first until I started playing it, I saw that it was more expanded than that.\n\nEach prisoner has their own name, age and story on how they got there. You'll actually feel sorry for some of them and sometimes you just have to put them up for death row.\n\nThe game is pretty glitchy every now and again. I tried to open the in game browser and came back to everything flashing white. All my objects and staff were deleted and replaced with white blocks. I'm sure it's just a small glitch I can fix but it's still something to be taken into consideration--the game will malfunction every so often. It'll just be part of the risk of buying it early.\n\nI should also mention that I got this on sale at Humble Bundle. I've been waiting for it to go on sale before I got it because I don't think it's worth the original price. It's a fun game and all but 30 dollars for this is way too much. I'd say 10 or 20 at the most.

It is still in Alpha and the game is playable since a long time. First of all, to see a dev team that dedicated to their game is a plus, they regularly release updates, bringing new elements to the game, correcting some bugs but of course creating news bugs ! But it's an alpha ;)\n\nIn Prison Architect, you start with your piece of land, some workers and a low budget. You'll have to turn this no man's land into a working penitentiary. Working penitentiary ? No, in fact you need to turn it into an industry that makes profit.\n\nLittle by little, you and your workers will build your prison. At first it is going to be small and empty but over time and with income, your prison will look better. Your choice, an Alcatraz or a luxuary hostel ? As long as there is a way to make money, all choices are good.\n\nOnce the basic dentention building is made ( kitchen, canteen, cells, showers and staff room,..Etc ) you are now able to welcome your first inmates. What will you choose ? Calm and nice persons who only made a mistake ? Or the evil men making your guards' lives a misery but who bring a nice federal grant ? Your choice and your responsability ! Then it's up to you to improve your prison, making it safe for everyone, impossible to escape and profitable!\n\n\nPrison Architect is already a big game, with its learning curve but once you get the hand of it ( should not take long ) it lets your with your creativity. You can build the prison th way you want it. You can make it looking like a smiling face or like fortress. But they don't always work and may lead to bankruptcy or to a massive riot that your special teams will not be able to stop,ending with all your inmates to escape. More than that, the game still has plenty of room for improvement and new features. Some are lacking but may be implemented one day ( gangs, ...Etc ). There is already enough to do and hours have plenty of great games.\n\nAbout graphics, well not everyone can like this 2D style but I like it. The graphics are simple but well adapted to the genre. It runs quite well if you meet the required specs. Bugs ? Yes there are bugs! It is still in alpha, but the devs need to fix some of them, those that ruin a prison like delivery trucks never stopping to your prison! The pathfinding for your workers also seriously needs to be fixed and/or improved, it is a pain in the neck to see them stuck in the corners of your walls.\nOther than that, nothing too serious. If you buy it, keep in mind it is an Alpha, everything is subject to changes and tweaks and so far, the game only improved.\n\nBuilding and managing your prison! For the better or ( and ) the worse, it's Prison Architect.","January 9, 2014","true","89.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

And I lucked out, this is actually a really enjoyable game (kinda feels dirty saying that about a prison sim but it's true), with a lot of depth to it. I played for four hours and I barely scratched the surface so far.\n\nThe one "con" if it can be looked at as that: certain aspects of gameplay aren't exactly intuitive or obvious. You might fumble around in the attempt to do certain things, until you finally get it "right". There are wikis and such online however, so nothing is impossible to accomplish between trial and error and outside sources. But the tutorial in my opinion is far too short and I'm hoping it will be expanded to explain certain things better (in my case, I was stumped by how to plan out the power lines/plumbing pipleines).\n\nStill though, even at this point in the game's development, I wouldn't call it a frustrating game. Instead I'd classify it as challenging at times, but a lot of fun regardless. Overall, I'd highly recommend it. It's one of the most unique sims I've ever played, and definitely more than worth the $10 I spent on it already.","June 21, 2014","true","107.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I've been with prison architect for a while now and let me say. They haven't let me down. The game used to be really bugyy, filled with little loopholes, AI problems, or simply backed up supply coming in. The core game was always there. For that I stuck with the game. I'll give you a little bit of a summary (?) on the game in general.\n\nGameplay: As you can clearly see, I've played this game a LOT. Built tons of prisons, messed around with prisoners, built a sandbox prison. I did almost everything. Thing is, I'm still into it. This game is BIG on replayabilty. Honestly I think I've built near identical prisons and they never end the same. The game has been lately centered on randomness of the AI. You used to be able to run the game overnight and nothing would happen. The game has now made it that you will have to pay attention to everything that happens in the game. Riots, drug overdoses, escaping prisoners, angry prisoners, tired guards, you name it.\n\nMechanics: The game has quite a few interesting mechanics on it. One being that prisoners actually work togethor on trying to escape, or they will constantly try to get contraband. You can choose to let the prisoners sit in thier cells and have the guards deliver food to them or you can let them run around in the yard and potentially get their "goods" from the fences. Good food, high costs? Small cells or big cells? Armed guards or normal guards? Lockdown or solitary? The game has a lot of choices for you to make for the prison, and a lot of them have a long lasting effect on your game.\n\nAsthetics: The game is very pleasing to the eye to view, eveyrthing is smooth, and they have worked on getting the graphics to work with each other. The prisoners and guards are different from each other; making them not a stereotypical guard or prisoner. Overall I would say that if you are for some reason worried about the graphics/asthetics or whatever you want to call them; you shouldn't have a problem wiht it.\n\nHumor?: Yes, I won't say too much, but once you see some of the prisoner's stories you will get a good number of laughs.\n\nRealism?: I would say this is a pretty accurate simulation of a prison. Prisoners have basic needs, as well as some extra ones like religion or drugs. Metal detectors detect metal tools and not medicine (duh) while dogs will help you with the actual drugs.\n\nCommunity: The community is a very funny one, and is overall accepting. No infamous sour community calling you a newb or anything. Most people offer their ideas of a "perfect" prison, and are usually open to give help or get tips.\n\nSounds: Well, I would say that the sound effects of the game are pretty accurate when you get near a partifcular room. (Eg. Near a cafeteria you hear eating or silverware when near a prisoner working out you hear him working out) I would say they payed attention to detail but I wouldn't honestly expect stunningly amazing music.\n\nTrue Sandbox: Definetly is a true sandbox, variety of starting options as well as giving you unlimited funds.\n\nToo Easy? Too Hard?: This one game honestly lets you modify your difficulty. If you want difficult you tell yourself only max prisoners and conditions of losing. New to the game? Take in small amounts of prisoners that are maybe minimum and turn of conditions. It is really up to you how hard you want to make it. If lets say you do "medium" difficulty then you might find that its more difficult if you messed things up early on or are new to it. It may be easy if you are a pro at sandbox games. I would say if its too easy or too hard its probably you and not the game.\n\nLast comments: Thank you all for reading this review I know it was a lot to take in. I would strongly suggest that you buy this game. The devolpers have worked so hard on this game, they've created hundreds of hours of joy for people and have realeased updates pretty regularily.\n\nRating: 10/10 I will definetly suggest this to someone else and look into their other games.","October 6, 2015","true","183.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Even if it's in Early Access, I would say it's better than some games which have been full released, though this of course, is very subjective. Still though, the concept is incredibly fun and amusing, even though... you're constructing a prison for some hardened prisoners? Particularly in Early Access, you can also come across some bugs, but that's fine, Introversion is doing a great job working on the game, and ironing out these bugs while also adding more new features.\n\nThe game has a bit of a learning curve, with only a very brief introduction before throwing you into the deep end. Why doesn't this or that work? But that's fine, you can only learn from your mistakes after all. Your prisoners have escaped because you locked your doors open? You forgot to build a perimeter wall? Your kitchen is too small to feed your prisoners? Well, you've learnt from your first mistake, your next prison will be much better! It's incredible just how quickly time slips by when you're building your own prison.\n\nThe sandbox nature of the game is incredible. Even at this early stage, you are given many options with which to construct and expand your prison. Do you allow or deny your prisoners comfort? Don't worry though, their cells must be indoors and have a bed and a toilet... But the possibilities are virtually endless. You can give cells bookshelves, or windows. You can make paths between different rooms and buildings of your prison. There are a huge number of different rooms and objects you can place to improve your prison, which only makes the game much more fun and interesting.\n\nBut that's not all! You manage your prison as you construct it, hiring staff (most importantly, builders to you know, build your prison), keeping your prisoners contained and reasonably happy, and completing your To-Do List. It can take a bit of work to figure out what you're doing wrong and what is going right, but the path is always an enjoyable one. Something that is only made better by the Steam Workshop support, offering incredible replayability with mods if you so choose - not that you really need to in order to sink many, many hours into this beauty.","January 15, 2015","true","22.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

A new patch comes out at the end of each month which is accompanied by a humorous and informative YouTube video. The game feels rather polished at this point, though a few bugs persist and some systems could use expansion.\n\nThere is a moderate learning curve, but grants (PA’s quest system) point you in the right direction in the early- to mid-game. You can select the order to attempt them (somewhat) and they don’t ever expire, though you can only have 2 or 3 at a time so it’s wise to plan ahead. The menus are easy to navigate and there are several overlays for displaying different types of information. You can pause and accelerate time freely, allowing contemplative or frantic gameplay as the player wishes.\n\nPrison layouts are quite malleable due to clear visual cues which make it simple to understand where the bottlenecks in your system are and correct them. Entirely redesigning sections of your prison is easy and enjoyable to accomplish. I’m not saying it’s a simple game; on the contrary, setting up a successful & profitable prison which is able to reply to situations automatically is quite difficult and rewarding.\n\nThe logistics element is very robust. Many types of things arrive or leave via truck and need to be moved around your prison (e.g. prisoners, food, exports, garbage, laundry, etc.) and streamlining these processes is engaging and fun. However, there are some types of things that workers can pull out of their pockets, which is a minor quip that I hope will eventually change. Once you have several hundred prisoners distributed between the three security types (min, med and max), creating separate regimes so that they can utilize your facilities at different times is an interesting and fun challenge. Simply watching your prisoners and staff go about their daily business is engrossing and highly enjoyable.\n\nI started playing it in Alpha 01 (which was a mess compared to now) and have continued to play on and off since. At 200 hours of play time, it’s literally my favorite game. PA is fun at every phase of play; you are never short of projects to work on, even after the grants run out and you start making your own goals. Fans of city-builders & logistics management will enjoy the detailed interacting systems. Since there are no pre-set building / room structures, PA allows the player to be expressive in their layouts. Creative gamers will enjoy making interesting prisons and publishing them on the Workshop, and a recent patch improved Workshop mod support so it will likely blossom with complexity in the near future.\n\nSubscribe to “Fin Lake Correctional” (find it in the Workshop), to play my highly tuned 500 prisoner multi-security facility.","September 4, 2014","true","311.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Frame drops can be noticed on less if you build on large maps or buy a few land expansions. Playing on 15-30 fps can be slow and painful to expand further.

But it is indeed a good game. As of Alpha 25, maintaining a functioning prison where anything can go wrong is pretty fun. The chaos that could break out in a matter of seconds requires quick player response to the issue, and can lead to some amusing situations which the player can learn from to improve their facility. The want to expand is always present, and it is likely some players will create prisons that are too big for their own good. The attention to details (education programs, the needs system, contraband, etc) continues to surprise me. The fact you are able to tell where contraband comes from, how it got in, where it went, and where it was found is just one of many of the detailed features that can affect the build of your prison.

Back to those days i really wanted 2 types of those: a school management and a prison management game. Introversion Software realized some kind of childhood dream here, just thank you for daring to cover this harsh topic!\n\nPrison Architect is a 2D prisoner management game. You'll be asked to give each wave of prisoners a place to sleep, to eat, to wash and eventually to learn as well as ensuring the atmosphere is safe enough for them to go out of there in 1 piece. There is always something to do in Prison Architect due to the pressure of the constant wave of prisoners coming. This brings good dynamics to the game.\n\nEach prisoner has its own personnality, a good warden will quickly split those petty thieves and those murderers into different level of security within your prison. Treat any of them bad, and they'll soon riot. Give them a place to receive education and visits from their families, soon your prison will be famous for putting criminals back on the right track.\n\nMost of the time in Prison Architect, you're buidling. New rooms, electricity, water, fences, the content is big concerning the building part. The gameplay diversifies when it comes to drug enforcement, establish a security strategy, tunnel digging counter measures... I really like the way  it densifies the game. You also need to research to get new features and get extra cash from grants when you achieve certain goals.\n\nIt's deep and well done. Graphics are unique, check the video above and you'll immediately understand. No technical problems are restraining you from playing the game except for the biggest prisons, but it's no big deal..\n\nAt the moment of this review (10/2014) the game is still early access. The team is working hard and keeps communicating with the community. I didnt want to play the early access not to waste the experience but at the moment the content is so important that you can really have fun with the game.\n\nI strongly recommend you to play Prison Architect!\n","October 30, 2014","true","28.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

In fact, if when you look at the videos of the game you think to yourself 'I think i'll enjoy that' then there's a 99% chance that you will.\n\nWith Prison Architect what you see is what you get.\nDespite the game being in Alpha it is still full of features and is completely playable if you don't mind facing some rather amusing bugs.\n\nThe first time I played Prison Architect I was a little apprehensive because despite many games claiming they are Theme-Hospital-Inspired very few manage to capture that level of addicted I felt when I used to play it. However with Prison Architect I was pleasantly surprised.\nI must have put 6 hours into my first play, building, destroying, restarting, but mostly learning.\nThe tutorial gives you the basic knowledge you'll need to play the game but like most games from this genre, how you play is completely down to you.\nYou'll probably spend your first play learning why metal detectors are important and why you don't need to buy 30 guards the seconds you play.\n\nThe gameplay itself is solid and enjoyable with enough content to make it worth the purchase and keep you entertained despite it's Alpha tag.\nThe menus are all very basic, and can be a little temperamental (the developers focus on content rather than polish at this point) and the graphics of the game are easy on the eye.\nThe updates come monthly, and usually bring one or two major new features (at least) and a ton of bug fixes so you're never left waiting too long to know what is going on which I think is an important part of Early Access games.\n\nOverall, I think the game is 100% worth buying if you're a fan of MicroManagement style builder games or you have a love as strong as mine for games like Theme Hospital and Dungeon Keeper.","August 3, 2013","true","84.9"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","18","29","0","2"

The first chapter, that tells a typical history of a man that kills his wife and her lover when he catches them making love at his home, it's a great beginning of an addictive game that make the players spend hours and hours playing.\nThe basic concept of the game is a prison (as is obvious from the title). You have to create a prison starting from nothing! You just have the help of the grants provided by the game that are four and help you with cash to build the basics of a detention center. With the time you are able to do many more things including put the prisoners working for you, earning and saving you money!\nAnd if you are not happy because you don't understand english or because you think that is very difficult to build the prison without the money provided by the grants or even if you want new textures to make the game look better you just have to go to the workshop and download(subscribing) some mods!\n\nOverall, the game is exciting and addictive.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/233450/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPrison Architect is a game that allows for a bit of insight into how a prison functions.\n\nThe game is a bit buggy but none the less playable if you follow some strict rules to meet grants. One bug that is annoying is a loan grant that restarts every time you re-load a saved game. Grants essentially are goals that you have to attain in order to receive a lump sum of funding.\n\nGame play includes ability to make kitchens, laundry rooms, prison cells, solitary confinement, guard outposts, offices for accountants/warden, close circuit television (if fog of war is on), woodshop (for prisoners to work in), classrooms, yard and a lot of other specific room types. Planning your prison is actually easy as the game let's you overlay a shadow zone for future rooms. When building certain zones such as prison cells, they need to be a certain size as well as need certain furniture to be considered of use. So, a jail cell would need a toilet, a bed, and at least a 2X3 (tiled) area. Variation in staff is also a consideration of the game as prisoners and guards alike can become hurt. Doctors need to be hired to ensure proper health of all pupils within the prison. Other staff is available such as chef's (to cook for the prisoners), accountants, and even K-9 guard units. The game can get pretty serious as shotgun guard units can be introduced. Guards can be given patrol routes or can be assigned to designated zones. This is actually a very nice feature in-game that helps you quickly cover zones that need an increase in supervision. Prisoners themselves need down time and rooms with pool tables, TV's, or telephones to entertain them. As the head of the prison, you are able to put it on lock-down and are able to call a strip search of each prisoner at anytime. They also need conference tables for when they have visitors!

If managing the incessant needs of digital prisoners sounds like your idea of a fun evening then Prison Architect may have you covered.\n\nPrison Architect, from developer Introversion Software, is in early access on Steam and is looking to bring a new edge to the management-sim genre. Now, before we start you are going to have to realise something pretty quickly: The first prison you build is going to be a horrible mess. A horrible, bloody, mess. While I thought I got the hang of the basic controls once I had played through the game’s introduction tutorial, I soon came to realise that actually I had only scratched the surface and my first prison mirrored something similar to the film Bronson – a violent, unmanageable mess – rather than the Shawshank Redemption vision I had in my head.\n\nBut what sort of Prison Architect will you be? The game leaves that decision entirely on your shoulders once you’re settled with the basics; Prison Architect allows you to feel good about yourself, you will be able to build reform programs through education and enable prisoners to learn vocational skills through a workshop system that improves their morale and ability to reintegrate with society upon release. And, of course, if they step out of line you can chuck them straight into solitary to separate them from the main body of your population and leave them to rot which, in turn, provides a deterrent to the other prisoners who may be thinking of stepping out of line. Each prisoner you take in to your prison provides a revenue stream for you to continue improvements and is, of course, offset by the amount of danger an extra man or overcrowding your prison may cause. This delicate balancing act is how you’ll spend a lot of your game, earning some extra cash to improve but not wanting to throw too many inmates in at once.\n\nThere is a simple tech tree which allows you to slowly introduce new ideas, staff members and rooms to your prison. You may desperately need an infirmary in your prison due to a riot that injured inmates and your staff or you have had a sudden intake of high-risk prisoners which means Patrol Dogs and Armed Guards are in order. Whatever type of prison you decide to build and how fast you need to expand is all down to how you set up the game to begin with. For a more challenging trial you can set it so you have a prisoner intake every single day at 8am and this means you’ll be focusing on some rapid expansion and introducing new cell blocks constantly while having the ability to switch off Prisoner Intake means you will be able to sit back and think about your prison design and put something together that makes sense and works far more efficiently and safely for your staff. You may have prisoners in with your main population that are awaiting execution – these are the most dangerous and likely to revolt because they have nothing to lose and need direct intervention by your guards on a regular basis. You can decide on the level of management you want on individuals and ensure they’re kept separate to the low risk, short stay offenders who may not need as much of your staff’s time.\n\nPrisoners will try and escape or smuggle contraband into your prison, they’ll walk around and take every opportunity to skip out on you by utilising any minor flaw in your prison’s design. But, once the day is over and their time is served, your prisoners will be released, reformed and hopefully willing to contribute to society once again. You can drill down and even micromanage every single need of your individual prisoners. You’ll see how long they have left to serve and and whether they’re likely to reoffend once they are released. You can hire a psychiatrist who will help you manage these needs and build the prison’s daily schedule to ensure everyone gets what they need from their day. It is usually the silly things that tend to foil me in Prison Architect – the prison had expanded so rapidly and I had not thoroughly expanded my kitchen to an appropriate level and, therefore, half my prisoners weren’t eating during the one hour of meal time I had allotted which caused the starving to push back against my guards who struggled to control such a large rabid mob.\n\nPrison Architect’s simple two-dimensional art style feels crisp and responsive and allows the game to run on just about every PC or laptop you may have opening up the (Usual resource intensive) management-sim genre to a whole new crowd. The game looks great and brings a slight comedic twist to the violence and dark nature of running a prison full of incarcerated inmates. The interface is simple and so goes a long way into allowing creativity. With a new room or angle in your prison two clicks away creativity is easily embraced.\n\nThere is so much promise in Prison Architect, everything it already offers and the constant, major updates that are consistently pushed to Steam it’s hard to imagine how far the final game will go in polishing the base mechanics and adding new systems for the player to develop and maintain a large scale, working prison. With Prison Architect already tied into the Steam Workshop system you can download different mods and spend a lot of time looking at other people’s work to inspire the direction of your prison. The ability to share your ideas and designs means inspiration is only a click away when you get stuck or how to get yourself out of the corner you have built yourself in too.","June 13, 2015","true","5.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Game is awesome but I had some issues in my last playthrough, so I'll wait the end of this year for full release before starting a new prison (and I already miss it).\n\nSuggestions for developers:\n\n● The plan tool should be improved letting us mark utilities too, being those a critical planning's characteristic.\n● Some events, like Bureaucracy unlocks, should be notified via text message, just like cash flow.\n● Side scrolling speed is way too slow when the visual is zoomed-in.\n● The clone tool should be able to select a wider area, because copying and pasting piece by piece is not comfortable at all; also I do not understand why RMB copies and LMB pastes, but there will probably be a good reason..\n\nBought this game on Summer Sale 2015; it comes with Trading Cards, a nice Badge and Emoticons but it doesn't have Achievements (not that I do care much about them).

However, I can't recommend this game due to performance issues.  The game does not hyper thread and will only run on one core of your processor.  As your prison grows larger your game performance noticeably decreases until it is simply unplayable.  In my current game I have 570 prisoners, 140 staff and a prison worth $1.7 million and get about 2 fps.  I am able to run much more graphics intense games at far higher fps with my rig.

You can either just go ahead and build a small prison you are comfortable with or expand and take on the challenges of high security prisoners and high security techs to help you overview you prison.\n\nDuring the game you can take on "grands" which are sort of like quests. You get a certain amount of money upfront and upon achieving the outlined tasks get a further monetary reward.\n\nYou make money every day from the difference between the money you make from housing prisoners and the money you spend on facilities and staff.\n\nYou also can do "research". Some staff when hired or some facilities when build unlock the ability to research new staff roles, facilities or techs which allow you to even further expand your prison and ability to control it.\n\nIf you get bored of your prison you can, after some time, have it evaluated and sell it for a nice sum of cash you can use when starting your next prison.\n\n--------------------\n- Early Access Note\n--------------------\n\nPersonally I have not yet come across a major bug in the earlier stages of the game and the stability of the game is very enjoyably.\n\nThe only minor bug I came across is when you build a door on a wall before you build the foundation, the foundation will build a wall over the door and you need to remove/re-add the door again but that's nothing to even worry about.\n\nI believe only at the higher end of facilities and staff are there bugs/missing features, such as when hiring lawyers and such, they apparently don't do anything yet for you. Though that is so far beyond the starting point of the game that you will have many hours of fun before you even get there.\n\nYou always can sell your prison before you expand to that level and start again with more cash on your next endeavor until the next game patch/update fixes those issues.","July 7, 2014","true","12.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Gameplay so far has been smooth, apart from occasional lag when the game has been running for a long time, and I have yet to experience any game-breaking bugs or crashes.\n\nWhat makes Prison Architect unique is the prison-building system. Walls, floors and furniture are not enough; one has to carefully plan out their layout to accommodate for electricity cables and water pipes, all of which have to be laid out by the player - perfect for anyone with OCD-like tendencies like myself. You also have full control of guard patrol routes, prisoner regimes, meals, contraband searches... to name just a few.\n\nIntegration with Steam Workshop also allows players to show off their prison set-ups, and anyone remotely interested in the game should definitely take a look at the layouts I have linked below, which were inspired by the Star Trek Enterprise and the Tower of London.\n\nUpdates and fixes are released frequently, and I found the developers to be very responsive. The best thing about Early Access is the opportunity to pitch suggestions and feedback directly to the team while the game is still in development. I've played released games with more bugs - please don't let the fact that it's still in Alpha put you off.\n\nIt's very exciting to be part of Introversion's new project, and I can't wait to see what will be added next!\n\nP.S. Make sure you add the character I submitted (Andre "Snake" Silva) to your prison!","September 4, 2013","true","69.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eminemboy/recommended/233450/","Eminemboy","YourHomicidalApe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eminemboy/","33 products in account","I bought this gamewhen it was in Early Access, and.... damn is it fun. The mechanics are perfect, and there are a suprisingly small amount of glitches (when it was in Early Access, there were tons of them). They consistently came out with new updates, and everytime they did, I came back to the game and started playing again.\nPros:\nFun but simple aesthetics\nInteresting story mode\nLots of materials/objects to try, which leads to a very diverse aesthetic in every prison you make.\nUnlike every other tycoon/management game ever, the game doesn't get easy after you get far into it. There are    random events and gangs that will screw you over no matter how far into the game you are.\nVERY balanced. I think this is my favorite part about this game - it's not ridiculously hard (like Dark Souls), but it's also not ridiculously easy.\nReplayable. No matter how many times I start a new prison, I always feel like it's new and different. I'm always excited to see where the game (and my brain) will take me.Cons:\nBuggy (it's not too bad, but you definetely still get them on occasion).\nPoor optimization. You would think this wouldn't be a big deal in a game with 32x32 graphics and small-scale prisons, but once you get up to a prison with ~500 prisoners, it starts to get very noticeable.\nIncredibly easy escape mode. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT, get this game because of the escape mode. You will be VERY dissapointed. The escape mode is a small, side-addition they added at the last-minute for a bit of fun. It's not something you will spend more than 10 minutes on at a time. You can escape any prison, very easily, by just following a simple recursive process:  Destroy > Surrender > Upgrade > Rinse & Repeat. Then you become a god because you have a 40% chance of insta-killing any guard. The only time I use escape mode is to see what my prisons look like from a prisoners POV. Sometimes I try to be as normal as possible when I do it - I just wanna see what it's like.\nNot much info on women's prisons. It's a relatively new release, but it seems rushed, and there are very few sources that actually explain how it works (wiki needs a LOT of updating).\nSmall (and shrinking) community. Most people bought this game, made one prison, enjoyed it, and then deleted the game. I've been noticing this more and more now, as every time I come back to the game, I see less and less news about it that's not directly from the developers.\n\n9/10, would recommend to every single person who has enjoyed a management game sometime in their life.","December 22, 2015","true","231.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

When it was officially launched today, I gave the new features a try, and have to admit I have very mixed feelings.\n\nFirst, the base sandbox game is TONS of fun! It's a prison management system, where you are free to treat prisoners with downright cruelty or as if they are on holiday. You can focus on strict profit, or on reformation. The basics are fairly simple, yet there is plenty to learn.The sandbox alone I'd recommend to anyone.\n\nWith the new release, there were two main additions: The campaign and the Escape mode. T\n\nThe campaign I DO NOT recommend. For me, it completely threw off the pixelated, cartoony vibe of the early access. It was dark, crude, and downright vulgar. Maybe that's reminescent of the darker side of certain prisons, but it completely threw off the overall feeling of the Prison Architect I knew and loved! It took the game from what I'd consider the upper end of "E: Everyone" to the upper end of "M: Mature". It is not for children. It's probably not for adults. It's definitely not for me.\n\n(Side note: I created a Mod called "Family Friendly Mod", which tuned down the adult content of the campaign. It's now at about a "T:Teen" level, or about what you find on "Prison Break".)\n\nHowever, the Escape Mode is AWESOME!!! You can play it on any saved prison, which allows you to customize your difficulty. It needs a little rebalancing, but playing an an OP legendary prisoner, racking up your murder trials, setting fire to a prison... It's like a whole new game within the game.

You manage an intricate prison, and despite the lack of endgame, this game has much to offer to any fan of Stategy/Simulation players.\n\nA game that gives you the tools and instructions to build any form of a wonderful prison establishment. Giving a top-down view of your prison, a player can see and control almost any of the aspects of your prison. You will start off with nothing more than some workers and starting materials, and must build on to develop a safe, and effective prison. I use the words safe and effective as this is where things can get up to your own description. As in, you feel like you don't care at all about your pixelated little prisoners? No problem! Beef up the amount of guards you have! Then, just divide all the prisoners all up, give them at least 8 hours of "funtime" in the workshop each day (since you get to control the schedule of the prison) so they make plenty of money for your needs, and keep them on lockdown to avoid all those violent riots that they will most certainly be planning.\n\nAlternatively, there is a "right" way to play, if you wish, where you properly attend to all the needs of your prisoners and staff, while also keeping the prison running in cost-effective manner. Thus, the prison will begin expanding at a rate which you the player would deem safe. This safety would be due to the prisoners NOT wanting to riot every chance they get. Have I mentioned that they can riot? Its quite the spectacle!\n\nAt any rate, this game can and most likely, will deliver in what you can expect out of it. You get to build and control a prison that is only functional if you build it, as such. Do I feel like a Prison Architect while playing this game? Absolutely! Do I feel the game is incomplete currently? Absolutely! Does that make me only more excited to see what the developer, Introversion Software, has in-store for us? ABSOLUTELY!\n\nEven at the current release (Alpha 15 at this time) the game feels well worth the expense of $30. The downsides at this point aren't much more than things that will most likely be arranged as the game goes into full release. This would mostly include a lack of endgame, and lack of certain features, such as the lawyer unit having absolutely no function at all, currently. Nevertheless, I look past these all, and feel that this game is quite a remarkable one.

I have not had any major crash issues, there are some little annoyances but I simply remind myself that this is an alpha so there should be so much more wrong with it.\n\nThe basic idea of the game is to create a functioning prison that makes money, sell that, make a larger prison that makes more money, rinse and repeat. I have spent hours trying to create the right environment for my prisoners and the staff to make them love being in prison. When I say hours I have played to date over 50 hours and I still make a slightly better prison each time I play.

You have to really pay attention in order to successfully manage your resources, keeping your prisoners imprisoned and expanding the prison so you can hold more prisoners. It's a tough balancing act, trying to expand your prison while maintaining discipline, health and hygiene. Yes, hygiene. The developers didn't forget anything, and you need to make sure you have enough showers to keep the prisoners clean and enough drains to get the water out without flooding the place. You also need to hire a chef to keep them fed, and a doctor to heal them up after those unfortunate but inevitable fights with guards or other prisoners. Every room needs to be a certain size in order to hold the required commodities, for example an office needs to have a desk, chair, and filing cabinet, while a prisoner's cell needs a bed and toilet.\n\nThe controls are pretty good, though I had a bit of trouble panning the screen because it moves too fast sometimes. This is definitely a mouse and keyboard game, and I don't think it would even be possible to play this game with a controller.\n\nThe graphics are nothing special, just some very generic elements that almost look like pixel art in their simplicity. That actually works in the game's favor though, because it adds to the dreary atmosphere of prison life, and it's hard to differentiate between different prisoners which really makes them feel like "just another prisoner #1234" and makes the game feel slightly more edgy.\n\nSound is also nothing spectacular, but again, I don't think that really detracts from the overall experience. In fact, you can play the game without sound and really not miss out on anything. I usually like to listen to music while I'm playing games anyway, so the sound isn't a big deal to me.\n\nSo if you enjoy real-time strategy games, Prison Architect is definitely worth a try. It's not an easy game, but it's rewarding to play and very enjoyable.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

That's with a capital "Y", and even it it was in the end of a sentence instead of the start I'd still say it's a Yes.\n\n\nTL;DR - Great management game.

It's a really enjoyable and surprisingly realistic simulation game that forces you to constantly make tough decisions on how to run your prison to maximize profit, security and comfort for the prisoners. I recommend this game if you're a die hard lover of simulation games as it's not really like any other one out there and it's a great, original genre to play through. Unfortunately, since the game is still only in Alpha, it has a LOT of bugs, but they don't really affect the gameplay that much and the game itself runs very well on low end computers aswell as high end gaming computers (take my laptop for example). Obviously these bugs will be fixed as soon as the game hits it's release and with constant updates adding new content and areas of the story, you really can't get bored of this game...

Now, this game is the opposite of "The Escapists", in the sense that, in this game you build a prison, but in that, you escape one (hence the name, escapists). Prison Architect is one of the more popular games by Introversion Software.\n\nIn Prison Architect you build and design a prison, but you don't have long (unless you turn off incoming prisoners - but that's besides the point) to build a basic prison. After the first 24 hours, which is about 10-20 minutes on normal game speed, 8-12 normal ranked prisoners will come in. They may bring contraband with them, or they may not. It's best to check everyone just in case. After a while, when you build up your prison a lot, you can start to make the prisoners do manual labour, for example, do the laundry and make numberplates. The laundry is the clothes (etc) of the actual prisoners. The numberplates, you can sell for $100 each (last time I checked).\n\nIf the prisoners don't like the prison, they can start a riot, try to escape and can make your prison get turned over to the FBI of sorts. If your riot goes on for long enough, you loose and the prison gets taken from you. When riots start, you can call in special forces, ambulances, fire engines and extra police. The fire engines don't really do anything at the moment, seeing as fires are so rare that (I would say) 60% of players don't know they exist, and the destruction they can cause.\n\nWhen you're building your prison, you have to keep in mind that you have a daily income, and if you spend more than said income, you will start loosing money instead of getting it. You can also loose your prison if you go bankrupt for too long, but there is a warning grant that gives you a reasonable amount of money to help you. If your income goes into the minuses, you can get it back up by getting new prisoners, selling items and giving the prisoners worse meals, but giving them worse meals can result in a riot or some very angry prisoners.\n\nThere are three classes of prisoners, low risk, normal risk and high risk. The low risk people hardly ever start fully fledged fights and never need execution. The normal risk, again, never need execution, but can start a reasonably dangerous riot or fight. The normal risk (to my experience) try and escape more often than the low risk. The high risk are the most dangerous, and may need executions, which you can get by making an execution room. These prisoners got into jail for things like Murder. If you're new to the game, I recommend you stay with low and normal. I don't like having high risk, they're too much of a pain.\n\nSo, even though this game is in alpha, it is worth a look at. Even at the full price of $25, it will give you hours of fun. During sales this game can go down to as low as $10-$15, which is an amazing deal.","April 20, 2014","true","38.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Prison Architect puts many current AAA development titles to shame by having lots of replayability. The campaign alone has a lot of meat on it, I've spent 9 or 10 hours on it before going into free mode to build my own prisons (you can do this at anytime and don't need to finish the campaign to do so).\n\nWhile Prison Architect is obviously a game where you can construct prisons, it is also a game where you can play as a prisoner and try to break out of prisons (either your own or one of the many available from the Steam Workshop), this was a welcome surprise to me after being disappointed by The Escapists. The architect mode is a delight as well, you have a whole slew of options when it comes to prison building and management. You want your prisoners locked up 24/7? Go for it. You want to have reform programs such as woodworking, laundry washing, and/or kitchen duty? You can. Want to build a death row and pull the switch on your prisoners? You can do that too, you sadist :P\n\nIf you like managing, building, or destroying things then this is likely the game for you. While Prison Architect isn't quite my game of the year so far, it comes close and the developers have more plans for the game on the way. Prison Architect is a solid 10/10 in my eyes and is well worth the price tag.","November 7, 2015","true","22.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

At the beginning taking out grants and building a basic detention centre can be very easy, but you have to make sure that you think of all the factors that could affect your prisoners. One wrong move and you may go in the red.\n\nYou have to gradually expand your prison, instead of allowing tons of prisoners at once. For example, if you have maximum security prisoners, you cannot accept them all at once in the beginning, because of how the prisoners will react to the little you have in the prison at the beginning, and you have to make sure that you accept prisoners at the right time, or they will just riot.\n\nThe variety of the rooms and programs the game has is just phenomenal in this alpha stage, all the extra activities and programs the prisoners can do and you can expand on really makes the game never get boring.\n\nI highly recommend this game, especially in this stage of development where you can see all the new rooms and interactions being added into the game, because I think that many more things are to be added into the game.\n\nScore\n76/100 (date 13. 4 2014 v.Alpha20)\n\nBuy it?\nIf you want.","August 16, 2013","true","218.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Prison Architect puts many current AAA development titles to shame by having lots of replayability. The campaign alone has a lot of meat on it, I've spent 9 or 10 hours on it before going into free mode to build my own prisons (you can do this at anytime and don't need to finish the campaign to do so).\n\nWhile Prison Architect is obviously a game where you can construct prisons, it is also a game where you can play as a prisoner and try to break out of prisons (either your own or one of the many available from the Steam Workshop), this was a welcome surprise to me after being disappointed by The Escapists. The architect mode is a delight as well, you have a whole slew of options when it comes to prison building and management. You want your prisoners locked up 24/7? Go for it. You want to have reform programs such as woodworking, laundry washing, and/or kitchen duty? You can. Want to build a death row and pull the switch on your prisoners? You can do that too, you sadist :P\n\nIf you like managing, building, or destroying things then this is likely the game for you. While Prison Architect isn't quite my game of the year so far, it comes close and the developers have more plans for the game on the way. Prison Architect is a solid 10/10 in my eyes and is well worth the price tag.","November 7, 2015","true","22.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"Prison Architect" is quite different.  Every prison cell you create results in a change in scenario.\n\nThere is a variety of prisoner characteristic's which in turn all produce another element to the game.\nThere are also multiple regimes you can create for the prisoners which define's the mood and behaviour of the prisoners.\n\nIts a great construction and simulation game with great amounts of action which requires some thought and strategy to keep your prison running.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who likes to play games that are intellectually challenging. OK, I like to play the odd racing game now-and-again aswell, but for something a bit more stimulating "Prison Architect" will be right up your street.","October 2, 2014","true","278.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'll just build a canteen and stop. My prisoners have got to eat somewhere!" But you don't stop at the canteen. To supply the canteen, you need a kitchen. But to power the kitchen you have to put down power lines. While waiting for it to build, you notice that the floors are dirty, so you hire some janitors. They're struggling to get through the cell doors, so you replace them with staff doors to save time. By now you've run out of money so you open up to your grants. "There's a grant to build a hospital and hire doctors," you see. You were going to do that anyway, so why not get paid for it? Now you're scouting out a good location for your hospital. How many hospital beds to you think you'll need? Two? Four? A hundred? You get your workers started on the foundation for your hospital.\nShoot. You need more guards to patrol the new hospital. Hire a few more guards. The staff is complaining that they're overworked and in dire need of a staff room. Got to keep the staff rested so that they work at top speed! You figure out where you're going to put the staff room and get the workers on the foundation. By then, you're able to go back to the hospital and route power to the new area, not to mention adding the beds and other requirements for a hospital room. You've overtaxed the power station with the new area, and get the workers to add some capacitors to increase the power.\n\nAll of a sudden, in the real world, your sister tells you that it's 1:00am and that you should probably go to bed.\nRinse and repeat for every session I've played of this game since I installed the new video card.\n\nThis game is very engaging and there is always something to do.

The fact that its just building prisons maybe? Want more depth? not sure... But I really think its the campaign or lack of challenges it has to offer.  I feel like they could've added more or done a lot more, with unique scenarios. Sort of like how roller coaster tycoon did.

Primarily this is achieved through Prison Architect’s single-player campaign which, when compared to other similar titles, is somewhat of anomaly least of all because it’s turns out to be an absolutely belting experience.\n\nOnce into the game proper and beginning with a ready-made prison, the campaign goes about tutoring players on everything that they need to know to construct their own grey bar hotel in addition to being able to maintain it once the groundwork has been lain. First off, the campaign impresses the need to create foundations for your various buildings, before attaching access to them such as doors and other optional things like windows and pathways to name a couple.\n\nOnce the foundations have been laid, a building can then be modified to function as a key part of the prison infrastructure ranging from such facilities as kitchens and canteens, through to the likes of showers and garbage disposal units. Naturally, it isn’t as easy as just designating a generic set of foundations to become a particular type of building either, as various infrastructure types have specific requisites that must be met before they can be constructed. A warden’s office for example, could require a chair, desk and filing cabinet in order to be built, whereas a canteen might need serving tables, eating tables and benches so that it might be brought into existence.\n\nIt’s not all just bricks, mortar and fancy furniture either; every building that requires power or water has to be hooked up to the appropriate utilities of both the latter and the former in order to function. Like everything else, this requires both time and money as you command your workforce to lay down cables, connect pipes and generally get everything sorted in time for when your prisoners start stomping about the place.\n\nSpeaking of which, there is the people factor to consider too. Staff need to be kept rested or else they become exhausted, while arguably the most important and difficult group of folks to keep happy are, somewhat expectedly, the inmates themselves. Clicking on each of your prisoners gives you a full breakdown of their personal demographics, neatly informing the player on everything from their name and crimes committed, to the length of their stay and the sort of security that they require.\n\nPrisoners that misbehave can be punished in a number of different ways too from being thrown into solitary, having their bunks searched at a moment’s notice or otherwise detained without privileges for as long as deem necessary. In most cases though, chaotic and disruptive behaviour stems from their needs not being met and a handy graph allows you to see where you need to tighten up in order to keep your prisoners in a good state of mind. In most cases, unruly prisoners are usually that way because they are lacking in either food or entertaining past-times, both of which can be tackled by providing the appropriate infrastructure; namely a decently stocked common room and a food-stuffed canteen, respectively.\n\nCertainly then, while it’s far better to address the problems at the root of your prisoners displeasure rather than just punishing them willy nilly – punishment itself can actually work in moderation and acts as an effective disciplinary tool to straighten out any potential troublemakers. It goes without saying though, that prevention is better than cure and in this case, assigning guard patrols to cover the busiest areas of your prison will go someway to preventing the inmates from running wild and smashing up the place. Of course, like everything else that’s worth having in the game, guards cost money and, well, there are two main ways to go about getting it.\n\nThe most easily attainable way to secure precious funds is through the admission of the prisoners themselves. You see, the prison receives between $300 and $2,500 for each inmate delivered, however, the amount is actually dictated solely by the security rating of each criminal and its here that a nifty risk/reward dynamic manifests itself. You see, the more dangerous prisoners unquestionably require more expensive infrastructure to keep them controlled, yet the monetary reward is significant if you’re able to accommodate them.\n\nAnother and much more interesting way that funds can be generated, is through the contracts and grants scheme that Prison Architect boasts. Here, increasingly large sums of money will be provided according to the completion of a number of pre-requisite conditions such as hiring a certain type of staff or succeeding in constructing a number of specific buildings. These work really well in engaging the player too, as they provide additional incentive to plumb the depths of Prison Architect’s substantial creative scope.\n\n+The scope to create your own prison is utterly staggering.\n\n+Main campaign is both great as a learning tool and as a separate experience.","February 25","true","223.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I really liked it overall. However, it didn't take long before it got a bit boring since you experience everything it has to offer by the end of your first prison. Its not a bad thing I guess since it didn't overstay it's welcome. You have to be careful building around prisoners too because if they see an opening, they will say, "Peace ♥♥♥♥♥es!" and book it like hell while your prison guards handle the situation. Prisoners will die and the prison nurses will have trouble sleeping at night but at least the situation was handled.\n\nThere isn't too much for the controls. It's mainly the mouse with the keyboard to either access the keyboard shortcuts or acts as a way to move around the screen. However, the UI works pretty well. Its easy to navigate, there's a search bar to search for certain assets you want to put into your prison, and you place it in as such. The assets include: Important human beings, not important human beings, chairs, vending machines, TVs, Cameras, automatic doors, non-automatic doors, and more for sure. This game has a surprising amount of depth to it in the building department since you have to build your own water pipe system and even wiring your electricty to certain parts of the prison so you can keep the lights on and get a good view of the prisoners getting brutally beatened or going mentally insane as you accidentally confine them to Solitary Confinement for 2 months when you meant 2 days. Yes, there's no way, that I know of, to revert that. Guess you're ♥♥♥♥ed, buddy.\n\nThis game also features a "Escape Mode" (or something like that) where you can choose a prison you either downloaded from the Steam Workshop or one you made yourself and you try to escape it as a prisoner. The controls are pretty standard but they work for that. Its kind of fun since you can form gangs to help you in it and can even get away with murder if you're good enough. Its also a good way to test how good your prison holds up. You can of course get loans or grants if you fulfill certain tasks given to you so you can keep these unlawful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in longer where they're heavily mistreated. The grants work against you since some of them require that you treat the prisoners good. Why do they need a TV?? ♥♥♥♥ them, they murder someone, here's a ball and some string, have fun, ♥♥♥♥♥♥. You can read up on what your prisoners did as well and they even have names. Some of the descriptions of the prisoners are pretty funny to say the least. There's so much to talk about, honestly, it'd take forever to cover it all. Just play the game if you're interested at this point but the review will continue.\n\nThe game looks pretty good. Its a top down 16 bit looking game that belongs on a Playstation 1 or SNES, if you're optimization is good enough. It's really nice on the eyes and it works quite well since you can tell the difference between everything and that's always a plus! The small character models look weird though, they are like all related to Rayman or something because they have no arms or legs. They are just a body, head, and round hands and that's it. It works so whatever.\n\nThe sound of the game works. This game is quite full of sound, actually. You can hear how angry the prisoners are when they are rioting against your prison guards and you can hear all the cooking and cleaning in the prison kitchen when they are serving the prisoners barely editable food. The prisoners, when they fight, have these cartoon-ish sound effects when they are punching each other God knows where. The sound in this game does make the prison much more alive and that is always much appreciated.\n\nAs for replayability, that depends on how you feel about the game after the first full fledged prison you make. Do you want to make more stuff, or do you want to put the keyboard and mouse down and move on? I think this game has the potential of having several playthroughs. Its definitely a good game to revisit after you haven't played it for awhile. Its a fun game but I don't know if replaying it directly after your first prison will be quite as satisfying as the first so you may want to take a break then come back to get another bite.\n\nOverall, even though people have died and the prison inmates sleep comfortably with their hidden shivs at night, its still quite an enjoyable experience and is quite fun. I got this for almost full price but I can say that this is worth the full price, overall. Get this game if you haven't already. Its worth a playthrough or two.","June 1","true","26.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I have this game in the same section of my library as Kerbal Space Program and Gnomoria. All three games are supported by their creators and their (sometimes dumb) communities, and every release adds something more that continues to bring the games closer to a 1.0 release.\n\nThis game (as I am writing this) has enough to keep you entertained, but there's no major "end game" goal. You can build a prison, sell it, and build a larger prison with money you earned from the last sale. That's it.\n\nIf you're okay with that, and the game is on sale, I'd easily suggest a buy.

Then it happened, the prisoners, enraged from food deprivation riot, almost immideatly seizing the canteen and killing any guards who dared attempt to enter. The riot expanded and guards went from hunters to hunted, their guns and tazers useless against pure rage. Then the prisoners siezed the armory and it was all over, every one now equipped with shotguns and pistols with fire in there eyes. The only 5 guards left held the exit.

You have to build and maintain your own prison. So you build cell blocks, kitchens, yards ect. Very simple, but extremly addictive - my first try took roughly around 8h - rare even for me.\nYou will have to deal with situations typical for prisons, like riots, prisoners attacing each other or your staff, escapes... But lets star from the beggining.\nTutorial isn't long, but it shows the basics just fine. After playing it, you should be able to build your own prison. You have 24 game hours before inmates arrival, abd by then you have to build basic facilities - like few cells, kitchen, offices, ect. Important thing is, that you need to think ahead. Careless expanding electrical lines may cause your generator to get overloaded, and that leads to energy shortage in whole prison. You also need to take care of risk, because the higher it is, the bigger chances are that your prisoners will do something stupid - what will affect your income. So you need to take care of their needs, don't infract their laws (lockdowns without reasons, or reasonless seraches are problem). They need to have good food, comfort, entertainment, and safety (so hiring too much ared guards will make them angrier), which is a bit too good for such scoundrels, isn't it? With game progress, you can unlock more features, like hiring K9 unit (guards with dogs), education, prison labour (making prisoners work for you), and so on.\nGame features much more things (like inteligence, allowing you to intercept contraband, and more), but writing about it would be pointless. This review would be too long, and that's not the point. So lets say about good and bad sides. Good thing is, that game is still in early access, and it's current form is great alredy. Playing it is (mostly) entertainging, but still there are some things that could be added, or improved. Theese are bad things: workers sometimes pass through the walls, you cant allow workers to open jail doors (so they need to wait for guard to come and open it, or for player to change door setting), or doctors  need to be sent to patients, not other way - which annoys me terribly, because if you wont notice that someone needs a doctor, he will die. And this doctor stays in his office. There should be a possibility to at least make him wander around the prison and heal everyone who needs it - and currently, you need to look for wounded prisoners/staff and send him to them. Apart of this, game is worth playing.","January 18, 2015","true","129.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Even in this early stage of development, Prison Architect offers a fleshed out experience that you'll keep coming back to. The idea of the game is simple: Build a prison that functions well, sell it for profit, and build another prison two times the size with the money earned from the previous prison. Seems simple, right?\n\nWrong. Managing your staff, prisoners, and layout all comes together in a formiddable micromanagement deal. You have the ability to pause time which heals a great deal with managing the nuances of your creation, so all-in-all it comes down to how -you- want to play the game.\n\nAt the current time of writing, there's a few frustrating bugs that might push some away. You're paying for early access at the time of writing, so frustrating issues are bound to come up. Know that the game's in -alpha-, and you can help the developer by posting these issues on their official forums.\n\nThe game is -very- playable at the moment, and highly recommended.

Prison Architect seemed silly, interesting and, at first glance, seemed to possess enough versatility over how much of a challenge you can create for yourself that I thought it was worth a try.\n\nI can't say I'm disappointed- but I was frustrated when I first started to play. This is because there are a bunch of small things that don't work quite right- for instance, sometimes you are unable to type in a name for the prison you're saving. Sometimes, your workers glitch and won't do a job, even though you have 20 and they aren't doing anything else. Sometimes, if someone dies, their body won't load onto the ambulance or hearse/ corpse wagon, whatever it is, so you literally have one guard who keeps trying constantly to get rid of the body, and does nothing else.\nReally. Nothing else.\n\nNow, having said what I've said, I'll add that yes, this game is in alpha, so it isn't done. Also, yes, bugs exist with any game- this, I fully understand, but there are a few other issues which make gameplay a bit clunky; first, a giant checklist taking over part of the left side of your screen, which can't be minimized. Also, this game seriously lacks guidance- you fly blind for the most part, and that's a bit offputting when you are trying to do something like, say, make a water pump system work, or figure out guard rotations. There's a shortage of tips, and since you hit the ground running when you first start to play, there isn't a great deal of time for learning curves.\n\nIn addition to that, there's no clear way to understand what goes on with specific aspects of your prison, such as programs and classes- why, I asked myself at least 10 times, am I setting up a class with 7 interested and qualified inmates and the class remains empty, even though they have the time in their schedule for work??\n\nI could go on, but this is supposed to be a review, not a rant, and to be honest, all frustrations aside, this game is at least a little addicting. Though the glitches and inconveniences can be offputting, the fact is that the game itself is fun, has great potential, and, as I said before, provides a challenge. It's worth a look, and, yea, sure- it's worth the money, as long as the developers keep moving forward and improving.","May 26, 2014","true","107.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It has elements of sandbox/construction with managed tiers for punishment, rehabilitation, kitchen menu etc... right down to micromanaging each hour of each prisoner's day.  You can decide to create the most horrific environment for your prisoners... or maybe you want to excel at rehabilitation & prisoner "recovery".  Either way the well stocked options provide freedoms to the user that all simulation games should have... most of the features seem to work already!  Game play is kind of "real" ... with comic book style scene transitions & backstories.  However if you can get past the prison thing and just "play the game" it is very enjoyable and addictive.  Though this is an early access game it is totally payable in it's current state.\n\nIf you like simulation/sandbox/management style games... or enjoyed any of the "Tycoon" series of games... this is one with a more serious story line/undertones (you can skip the scenes also).  Definitely worth checking out.\n\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/233450","January 10, 2015","true","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A top down Prison building/management simulation. You build a prison (duh) along with it's many amenities, then hire various staff, research upgrades, set routines for the inmates, thwart escape attempts, rehabilitate, treat and occasionally, fry these tiny misunderstood orange clad bodies with your custom built electric chair. You also have to keep the rest of the less troublesome inmates happy too, otherwise general dissent has a way of quickly escalating into a full blown riot. Leaving you with lots of blood (definitely hire cleaners) and lots of tiny orange guys with red holes in them, courtesy of your riot police. So build a morgue. Or keep them happy of course.\n\nThe thing is, the more dangerous prisoners tend to give approximately zero f*cks about your agenda, since they all have their own little backstory and plans for the future. Some of the scum, sorry, inmates, think they're starring in the lead role of Prison Break and others appear to believe they're in The Longest Yard. I have a large morgue.\n\nOverall a fun engaging title. The best prison building/management game I've played, which admittedly isn't saying much considering the competition in this area. Being an early access game, official content is still relatively light on the ground and the game has little depth if you're an old hand at building/management simulations, but it does have a solid little Steam Workshop community going on. This is one of the few early access games actually worth coming back to from time to time.","December 24, 2014","true","144.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Prison Architect is a creative sandbox game in which you build and manage a prison. The addictive concept, depth and easy to use interface makes this one of the most intriguing and enjoyable games I have played in a long time.\n\nThe top-down presentation is simple yet superb. The user-friendly interface makes navigation simple and easy to use. There is quite a lot of stuff to do in terms of construction and designing so having such a well-designed layout of functions is crucial to this games brilliance. The strategic depth here is also incredible and the way you design your prison and how you manage prisoners happiness can be huge factors to your overall success.\n\nThe bigger your prison becomes; the tougher it is to manage. Suddenly you have maximum security prisoners at your door and it's up to you to expand and enhance your prison to accommodate the influx whilst keeping people including staff and fellow inmates happy and safe. There is a considerable challenge here particularly when you grow your prison and the population. The level of depth in the design of your prison along with the management strategy aspect is simply staggering.\n\nOverall, Prison Architect is an amazing game even at alpha stage. It's polished and incredibly well designed in all areas. The developers have done an amazing job so far and this game will only grow further in months to come.","July 24, 2014","true","23.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Maybe not EVERYONE likes this game but, the amount of DETAIL put into this game is just, amazing.\n\nThe game is about running a prison, and it sticks by it, your prison is in your hands, BUT, my favorite part, is that it's not FULLY in your control.\n\nSure you can assign patrols and use non lethal, but VERY effective tools to placify an inmate. But even with that, you will always get TERRIFIED if one prisoner starts rioting, and they take out a weapon, the guards can fight them, but they attack OTHER inmates, then its the matter of getting a guard ASAP to the area, or risk a life or 2, and recently, when the ability to FAIL was added, suddenly you couldn't let the inmates escape or let a riot go on for too long, which made it MORE intense when a riot broke out.\n\nThe developers themselves are probably the most best ive ever seen, they never get off track with other ideas, as explained in one of their videos, but, they take ideas from all the players, and get the community and, are now working to wipe most of the bugs out of the game\n\nAs mentioned before, not every person may like this game, partly because of the amount of patience needed, but, i dont care, in my opinion, also, the freedom of the modding community is perfect\n\nThis game, takes the idea of running a prison, and strategy, and mashes it up into one game, would i reccomend it, OF COURSE, i have put hours, not only building my OWN prison, but downloading others, huge riots, fires, and a prison built for 16 must quickly be adjusted for 45!\n\nYou dont have to, but to sum all of this up in 3 words, they would be: BUY THIS GAME","July 1, 2014","true","171.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a special little game that always brings the best strategical ideas and gives the player a special kind of excitement.\n\nIn my experience there are three kind of gamers for this: The first are more obsessed by the security of their prison, and less interested in the comfort of the tenants. Since the conditions of the correctional facilities around the world are harsh, you can easly get interested in the same kind of treatment. The second are the ones that will make a recreational camp from their project. Making the prisoners happy will make your life much easier in the game, but can lead to some reliability issues and future solidness decline. And finally the third type of players that will combine the two above making an institution that is the best state of confinement for our delinquents. It is everyones choice how they play the game, but keep in mind that you need to have some ground future ideas for the longevity of your prison.\n\nThe game graphics is simple, since we are dealing with a tycoon-type. You don't need too much visuals to develop your design skills. Prison Architect has plenty of options, items and materials you can choose from. It's an experience that will last for hours. The failure will increase your will to start over and the success will give you many satisfactions.\n\nI would like to talk a little about an intriguing feeling that conducts the hole game. The faces of the prisoners are so weakly developed and it got to my mind that you don't really need to see them. They are nothing. Your only concern is that the hole institution will run clean and safe. The anonymity of their facial expressions brings us the real obscurity and relentlessness of this world.\n\nOverall, except some minor bugs, this is a great encounter with the problems you have to deal in running this kind of facility. It's a great game and I would recommend it to all the strategy-tycoon lovers.\n\nBeware of the riots!","August 25, 2015","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

A top down Prison building/management simulation. You build a prison (duh) along with it's many amenities, then hire various staff, research upgrades, set routines for the inmates, thwart escape attempts, rehabilitate, treat and occasionally, fry these tiny misunderstood orange clad bodies with your custom built electric chair. You also have to keep the rest of the less troublesome inmates happy too, otherwise general dissent has a way of quickly escalating into a full blown riot. Leaving you with lots of blood (definitely hire cleaners) and lots of tiny orange guys with red holes in them, courtesy of your riot police. So build a morgue. Or keep them happy of course.\n\nThe thing is, the more dangerous prisoners tend to give approximately zero f*cks about your agenda, since they all have their own little backstory and plans for the future. Some of the scum, sorry, inmates, think they're starring in the lead role of Prison Break and others appear to believe they're in The Longest Yard. I have a large morgue.\n\nOverall a fun engaging title. The best prison building/management game I've played, which admittedly isn't saying much considering the competition in this area. Being an early access game, official content is still relatively light on the ground and the game has little depth if you're an old hand at building/management simulations, but it does have a solid little Steam Workshop community going on. This is one of the few early access games actually worth coming back to from time to time.","December 24, 2014","true","144.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You will notice some bugs and weird behaviour after a few dozen hours played, but usually nothing mayor.\nThe only thing that really needs fixing is the performance in the end game. When constructing large buildings, the game slows down and only runs in slow motion. I had this even though my CPU was only occupied about 30%.\n\nI like how each monthly update brings interesting new things that make it worth to start the game again and sometimes even require complete new strategies.\nThe graphic style is also very suitable for a game like this. Anything less comic-like would probably be too realistic.

It's a special little game that always brings the best strategical ideas and gives the player a special kind of excitement.\n\nIn my experience there are three kind of gamers for this: The first are more obsessed by the security of their prison, and less interested in the comfort of the tenants. Since the conditions of the correctional facilities around the world are harsh, you can easly get interested in the same kind of treatment. The second are the ones that will make a recreational camp from their project. Making the prisoners happy will make your life much easier in the game, but can lead to some reliability issues and future solidness decline. And finally the third type of players that will combine the two above making an institution that is the best state of confinement for our delinquents. It is everyones choice how they play the game, but keep in mind that you need to have some ground future ideas for the longevity of your prison.\n\nThe game graphics is simple, since we are dealing with a tycoon-type. You don't need too much visuals to develop your design skills. Prison Architect has plenty of options, items and materials you can choose from. It's an experience that will last for hours. The failure will increase your will to start over and the success will give you many satisfactions.\n\nI would like to talk a little about an intriguing feeling that conducts the hole game. The faces of the prisoners are so weakly developed and it got to my mind that you don't really need to see them. They are nothing. Your only concern is that the hole institution will run clean and safe. The anonymity of their facial expressions brings us the real obscurity and relentlessness of this world.\n\nOverall, except some minor bugs, this is a great encounter with the problems you have to deal in running this kind of facility. It's a great game and I would recommend it to all the strategy-tycoon lovers.\n\nBeware of the riots!","August 25, 2015","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Introversion has taken time to listen to the people who play their game, make videos to show up the updates and highlights of their development process, and try to add as much detail as they can as they go. While it is a "game in progress," it has been an awesome ride this far and I can't wait to see what comes next.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's a fun simulation that's only gotten better with time. Your options are many, although your starting funds are few. Persistence pays off in the long run, so it helps to put a few hours aside a day to play the game and make one more goal (making room for more prisoners, implementing a better daily schedule, finally building the visitation room, etc). It will hook you if you are into detailed sims, and maybe even if you are not. Just be careful - this game can suck hours away from you without you noticing.","March 28, 2014","true","16.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is still an alpha (15/06/2014) however the game seems almost completed! The game has so much potential-some of which it has already forfillled. The glitches, such as prisoners remain seated and act as normal when a deadly fire is in the room, make the game hilarious and laughable. Even if it is an alpha it does what a game is ment to do; entertain you. It isnt severly incompleted. Eveything in the game works flawlessly-most of the time-and you forget it is an alpha. Also there are fun glitches/things, e.g. the prisons sit on the blade of a saw in the workshop as they are using it, the prison jail doors get overwhelmed with people trying to get through and the guards can't open it for them so for hours your prisons are waiting at a door!\n\nThe gamemakers (introversion softwere) also go very in-depth with detain in some parts of the game. An example of this is the attention to detail to the prisons. Each is given a name, picture, list of convictions e.g. how many years served (and what for) and how many years to serve(and what for), also family, security level, #ref number, recent status, activity, mood, condition, experiance, punishment/security grading, bio and more. You can also make your own character by purchasing the 'Name in Game' upgrade dcl which allows you to create your own character which could even be based on you with your name!\n\nThe only complaint I have is the price, especially of the 'Name in Game' upgrade dcl. I find that £15 for your name and bio in-game isnt worth £15. And that's just for name in the game, if you want the game as well it is just short of £35. The game (only) is £20. This game does not have good graphic qualitly however for a game like this you don't want nor need it as the graphics suit the game perfectly.\n\nOverall, it is a great game and introversion have done well-so far. I would reccormend you buy this games as if you like strategy, organisation and building this game is perfect. It is worth the £20 sale price. I would also highly recommend you upgrade the game with the 'Name in Game' dcl ONLY DURING A SALE(personally £15 is over-expensive). This is an exellant game with everything I would expect in it and more. I cannot wait to see what the game developers have instore in the next update!

There are still quite a few bugs but you are able to work around them. My only real complaint with the game is that it starts off with a toturial level which gets you to build an execution room, however thats the only toturial you get and you are left to figure it out on your own after that. I had to restart my prison over many times because it is quite hard at first to understand how to build your prison and get it running most efficiently. It would be really helpful if they could add more toturial levels to help new begginers.","December 29, 2014","true","80.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is still an alpha (15/06/2014) however the game seems almost completed! The game has so much potential-some of which it has already forfillled. The glitches, such as prisoners remain seated and act as normal when a deadly fire is in the room, make the game hilarious and laughable. Even if it is an alpha it does what a game is ment to do; entertain you. It isnt severly incompleted. Eveything in the game works flawlessly-most of the time-and you forget it is an alpha. Also there are fun glitches/things, e.g. the prisons sit on the blade of a saw in the workshop as they are using it, the prison jail doors get overwhelmed with people trying to get through and the guards can't open it for them so for hours your prisons are waiting at a door!\n\nThe gamemakers (introversion softwere) also go very in-depth with detain in some parts of the game. An example of this is the attention to detail to the prisons. Each is given a name, picture, list of convictions e.g. how many years served (and what for) and how many years to serve(and what for), also family, security level, #ref number, recent status, activity, mood, condition, experiance, punishment/security grading, bio and more. You can also make your own character by purchasing the 'Name in Game' upgrade dcl which allows you to create your own character which could even be based on you with your name!\n\nThe only complaint I have is the price, especially of the 'Name in Game' upgrade dcl. I find that £15 for your name and bio in-game isnt worth £15. And that's just for name in the game, if you want the game as well it is just short of £35. The game (only) is £20. This game does not have good graphic qualitly however for a game like this you don't want nor need it as the graphics suit the game perfectly.\n\nOverall, it is a great game and introversion have done well-so far. I would reccormend you buy this games as if you like strategy, organisation and building this game is perfect. It is worth the £20 sale price. I would also highly recommend you upgrade the game with the 'Name in Game' dcl ONLY DURING A SALE(personally £15 is over-expensive). This is an exellant game with everything I would expect in it and more. I cannot wait to see what the game developers have instore in the next update!

It's a special little game that always brings the best strategical ideas and gives the player a special kind of excitement.\n\nIn my experience there are three kind of gamers for this: The first are more obsessed by the security of their prison, and less interested in the comfort of the tenants. Since the conditions of the correctional facilities around the world are harsh, you can easly get interested in the same kind of treatment. The second are the ones that will make a recreational camp from their project. Making the prisoners happy will make your life much easier in the game, but can lead to some reliability issues and future solidness decline. And finally the third type of players that will combine the two above making an institution that is the best state of confinement for our delinquents. It is everyones choice how they play the game, but keep in mind that you need to have some ground future ideas for the longevity of your prison.\n\nThe game graphics is simple, since we are dealing with a tycoon-type. You don't need too much visuals to develop your design skills. Prison Architect has plenty of options, items and materials you can choose from. It's an experience that will last for hours. The failure will increase your will to start over and the success will give you many satisfactions.\n\nI would like to talk a little about an intriguing feeling that conducts the hole game. The faces of the prisoners are so weakly developed and it got to my mind that you don't really need to see them. They are nothing. Your only concern is that the hole institution will run clean and safe. The anonymity of their facial expressions brings us the real obscurity and relentlessness of this world.\n\nOverall, except some minor bugs, this is a great encounter with the problems you have to deal in running this kind of facility. It's a great game and I would recommend it to all the strategy-tycoon lovers.\n\nBeware of the riots!","August 25, 2015","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I have yet to play the completed version, however, considering how amazing the development process was, I can safely assume this game is nothing sort of amazing.\n\nOf all the games I've "pre-purchased", the makers of this game by far set the gold standard. The timing of the updates; you could set your watch to. The additional features and commentary provided explaining the changes were both humous, entertaining, honest, personal and progressive. I believe they were on update 5.0 when i bought in, and the game at that point was more polished and better developed than some "finished" games i've played.\n\nHonestly, I'm almost sad to see this game become a finished product. It's like I have empty nest now, no longer able to watch the game grow and unfold.\n\nThis game is currently at 33% off, and the cheapskate in me thinks that is a great deal. I'd even say the full price of the game is very fair.\n\nThis game is a complete sandbox that will let you grow at your own pace.\n\nGraphics - clean, crisp, runs well even on lesser machines (even an ipad can take it, those pieces of garbage)\nGameplay - fun, you are in complete control\nReplay Value - endless\nDifficulty - you can make it was easy or as hard as you want it.\n\nThe ONLY thing i can think of that would make this game better was if you could have 2 players build and manage a prison at the same time... maybe they added that in the last update... maybe they will add it in a future update.... time will tell.\n\nIf all pre-purchased games were like this, I would have a ♥♥♥♥ ton more games. Sadly this is the last 'pre-purchase' I will make (♥♥♥♥ you dirty greedy developers (not this game, other games)) and thus I can say it was the best 'pre-purchase' or 'alpha' I will ever make.","October 6, 2015","true","296.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What can I say about this game….\nThe Devs have gone above and beyond what I had expected from them and the game. I saw it as a fun building simulation, what it is, is much much more.\nI gave this game a positive review a few month back and if I could I would double that review now. Worth every penny they ask. The game is well polished and if there are issues those issues are taken care of rather quickly.\nOther game makers take note, this is how you treat your customer base, this is how you develop a game.\n\n\n****\n\nThis is onsale right now when I write this. less than 5.00 that is a steal! I spent 30 and trust me I think 30 was well worth it. It is very enjoyable. The game is not perfect but it does not need to be, what it does is perfect.

Some things I would like to see added to the game would be the ability to select certain personalities for your prisoners, the ability to turn off certain needs (e.g. Spirituality) and some form of iron man mode.

A longer version is that this game has brought me some really good times. It's a very pleasant and satisfying sim with many great features that create huge depth for this minimalistically stylized game.\n\nJust when you think that you have the perfect, most stable running prison in the world, the inmates take advantage of your arrogance and point out the flaws in your system and kill the mole that was supplying you with information about gangs and escape attempts. This hurts your prison's value, you walk on the razor's edge of being halled off to jail yourself for criminal negligence. For being a sim game it actually brings a huge element of a power struggle between you and the inmates. No other game has played on my ego as much as Prison Architect.\n\nThe devs have put in a lot of time and hard work in this game and it doesn't seem like they are about to stop. Even after the 1.0 release they keep updating with new features and balances that make the game more enjoyable, more intricate, and pushes the "end-game" portion slowly out of the equation.\n\nEach build of this game makes your prison more and more into a living, breathing world. You easily forget about the minimalistic (but beautifully designed) sprites and look at your population and staff as real people.\n\nThe AI's actions feel planned out and specifically designed for the prison that you built yourself. Back to the drawing board.\n\nA must-have for any fan of management games.","March 18","true","23.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its one of the few early access games that has been updating constantly and at a steady pace. Each version brings something new, better UI, deeper gameplay, extra features and bug fixes. They listen to suggestions and complaints and try to address them asap, they add features when requested and polish everything over and over again until its acceptable to players.\n\nAt the moment this has to be one of the most intricate simulators, with a lot of micro and macro managing features out there. Every little aspect of your prison population like meals, sleep time, work, study and contraband can be managed.\n\nI do wish they added female prisons and multi-cells though. Other than that - its almost finished.\nThis, kerbal space program and craft the world are the prime examples of how early access games should be done and how players should be treated.","December 20, 2014","true","43.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I knew I wanted a game but which game. I'm on a Mac you see so not many games are available. Prison Architect was there though. I was questioning my mate  (I later found out that he had no previous experience with the game) and he just said "If you want." I responded with, "Of course I want!" And thusly proceeded to acquire Prison Architect in the usual fashion.\n\nI ordered a pizza and let the game download, presuming it would take my 'terrible' internet a while to download. I was surprised to find that the game was simply 150 MB in size and my 'terrible' internet was able to download it in a matter of minutes. I went onto it. Tried to change around with the settings, being in a Skype call and having the game sounds blaring into your ears wasn't the greatest thing. With that tweak well and truly sorted I moved on to play the game.\n\nThe first thing the game asked me to do was to build an execution room and I was already excited. Have you always wanted to build a room to kill all those that wronged? Then this is the game for you! Having completed the introduction I thought I was ready to move onto larger and greater things... I've never been so wrong in my life before.\n\nI went onto load up a world in all it's default gloryness. Built the usual holding cell, office, canteen and kitchen. Proceeded to hire a warden, one million guards and two cooks. Then the normal risk prisoners arrived.\n\nI was there in all my naivety believing the guards would able to handle these prisoners... again, I've never been so wrong in my life before.\n\nTrying to pimp out the kitchen when a red sign pops up saying '1..2...3...4..5...6...7 prisoners escaped'. I immediately scanned the area, spotting out the escapees and bringing them back to justice. Turns out, the guards would rather fight a guy inside the holding cell as opposed to capturing those who flee. It was a dead end and I had to plow on.\n\nIn the end, I just turned out to be really bad at the game and as much as I found it difficult it truly is an enjoyable game.

In many brownie recipes, the proportion of flour to other ingredients is significantly less than in other baked goods. Reduce the amount of flour to make your brownies dense, fudgy, or rich. If you prefer brownies with a cakelike texture, look for brownie recipes with more flour. Some cakelike brownies contain milk or buttermilk, making their texture more like rich, fluffy chocolate cake.\n\nStep 2: Chop chocolate\n\nOf course, you can't make chocolate brownies without chocolate. Using a chef's knife, coarsely chop chocolate bars or squares on a cutting board. Chopped chocolate melts smoothly and evenly, and it won't scorch. Some recipes call for making brownies with cocoa powder. Both are delicious and easy ways to make chocolate brownies.\n\nStep 3: Melt chocolate and butter\n\nPlace the chopped chocolate in a saucepan.\nCut up the butter and add it to the saucepan with the chocolate.\nHeat and stir over low heat until all of the chocolate and butter is melted and the mixture is smooth.\nRemove the saucepan from the heat, and let the chocolate mixture cool. This mixture will serve as the chocolate base for your brownie recipe.\n\nStep 4: Stir in sugar\n\nAdd the sugar to the melted chocolate and butter. Stir with a wooden spoon until the sugar is completely mixed into the chocolate and butter.\n\nStep 5: Add eggs\n\nAdd the eggs one at a time. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon after each addition until the egg is completely incorporated into the chocolate mixture.\n\nBeat in the vanilla with the wooden spoon.\n\nStep 6: Add flour\n\nIn a separate bowl stir together the flour and baking soda.\n\nAdd the flour mixture all at once to the chocolate mixture.\n\nStep 7: Mix batter\n\nGently stir the brownie batter until the flour is moistened.\n\nUse a heavy-duty rubber spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the saucepan.\n\nIf desired, stir in chocolate pieces or chopped nuts.\n\nStep 8: Bake, cool, and frost brownies\n\nGrease your baking pan or, if desired, line it with foil for easy removal. Spread the brownie batter in the prepared pan.\nBake brownies as directed in the recipe. Most brownies bake at 350 degrees F for 25 to 35 minutes.\n\nLet the brownies cool completely in the pan on a wire rack.\n\nIf you want frosted brownies, wait at least an hour after baking to be sure the brownies have completely cooled.\n\nPrepare the frosting. Chocolate-lovers may enjoy brownies with chocolate frosting, but we also recommend a simple vanilla frosting, cream cheese frosting, or even rich peanut butter frosting. Use an offset metal spatula to frost the brownies while they are still in the pan. Cut the finished dessert into bars, serve, and enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(I got in prison for copy and pasting this)","January 23","true","50.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","2","2","3","0"

In many brownie recipes, the proportion of flour to other ingredients is significantly less than in other baked goods. Reduce the amount of flour to make your brownies dense, fudgy, or rich. If you prefer brownies with a cakelike texture, look for brownie recipes with more flour. Some cakelike brownies contain milk or buttermilk, making their texture more like rich, fluffy chocolate cake.\n\nStep 2: Chop chocolate\n\nOf course, you can't make chocolate brownies without chocolate. Using a chef's knife, coarsely chop chocolate bars or squares on a cutting board. Chopped chocolate melts smoothly and evenly, and it won't scorch. Some recipes call for making brownies with cocoa powder. Both are delicious and easy ways to make chocolate brownies.\n\nStep 3: Melt chocolate and butter\n\nPlace the chopped chocolate in a saucepan.\nCut up the butter and add it to the saucepan with the chocolate.\nHeat and stir over low heat until all of the chocolate and butter is melted and the mixture is smooth.\nRemove the saucepan from the heat, and let the chocolate mixture cool. This mixture will serve as the chocolate base for your brownie recipe.\n\nStep 4: Stir in sugar\n\nAdd the sugar to the melted chocolate and butter. Stir with a wooden spoon until the sugar is completely mixed into the chocolate and butter.\n\nStep 5: Add eggs\n\nAdd the eggs one at a time. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon after each addition until the egg is completely incorporated into the chocolate mixture.\n\nBeat in the vanilla with the wooden spoon.\n\nStep 6: Add flour\n\nIn a separate bowl stir together the flour and baking soda.\n\nAdd the flour mixture all at once to the chocolate mixture.\n\nStep 7: Mix batter\n\nGently stir the brownie batter until the flour is moistened.\n\nUse a heavy-duty rubber spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the saucepan.\n\nIf desired, stir in chocolate pieces or chopped nuts.\n\nStep 8: Bake, cool, and frost brownies\n\nGrease your baking pan or, if desired, line it with foil for easy removal. Spread the brownie batter in the prepared pan.\nBake brownies as directed in the recipe. Most brownies bake at 350 degrees F for 25 to 35 minutes.\n\nLet the brownies cool completely in the pan on a wire rack.\n\nIf you want frosted brownies, wait at least an hour after baking to be sure the brownies have completely cooled.\n\nPrepare the frosting. Chocolate-lovers may enjoy brownies with chocolate frosting, but we also recommend a simple vanilla frosting, cream cheese frosting, or even rich peanut butter frosting. Use an offset metal spatula to frost the brownies while they are still in the pan. Cut the finished dessert into bars, serve, and enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(I got in prison for copy and pasting this)","January 23","true","50.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","2","2","3","0"

This was one of my first Early Access games besides Don't Starve and it hasn't let me down. The developer has provided the community with regular updates and the community itself isn't getting tired of providing mods.\n\nI really enjoy starting new every once again, just to create a new layout for my prison. I feel like the UI is quite intuitive, creating a prison with the necessary rooms is easy. Tools like "Cloning" make it even easier to add already created rooms to your prison layout later on, if you need.\nThere are a lot of different rooms like cells, holding cell, family cells (only for female prisons) and dormitories to "store" your prisoners, showers to fullfill their hygiene need, kitchen and dining halls to feed them.\nYou can unlock more rooms later on by unlocking different perks by your staff members like Prison labour. This gives you the opportunity to let your prisoners work as janitors (cleaning the facility) or in a workshop or laundry to clean clothes and make licensing plates which can be sold. This way you can earn some extra money.\nOf course there are additional rooms just to make your prisoners happy and make sure they are not starting a riot quickly like a library, common rooms, visitor rooms or a shop.\nThis game has a lot to it and if I would have to compare it to another game, it would be Dungeon Keeper. Of course, you are not luring monsters with your rooms, and your are not preparing to fight some white knight. But still creating the rooms and keeping your inmates happy somehow reminds me of the good old dungeon keeper times.\n\nI would full-heartedly recommend this game, if you are into building/management stuff.","March 12","true","70.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apokaladle/recommended/233450/","Apokaladle","Apokaladle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apokaladle/","2138 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNOTE: This is a review of Alpha 20. I will update this review as new versions are released.\n\nPrison Architect is an amazing game. I've played 25 hours at the time I'm writing this, and I confidently expect to reach triple digits.\n\nGameplay is exactly what you see in the trailers. You build a prison, and you deide whether it's a hellhole with armed guards at every turn or a relaxing, communal environment where prisoners occupy themselves with education and playing pool. I found the process of building blueprints a little unintuitive, especially when they add on to an existing building, but you should be able to construct all manner if prisons in no time. If you just want to jump in a muck around, there are prisons and mods you can download from the Steam Workshop. You can also upload your own prison and share it with the masses.\n\nThe prison theme is also one worth discussing. While the devs have said that they don't wish the game to take a side, and that there should be functional ways to play all prison styles, you still notice little in-game events that can stay with you after you close the game. In a very early prison, I didn't build phones or visiting rooms fast enough, and the prisoners rioted because they missed their families. Unfortunately, at present the prisoners feel largely interchangeable, with most of them only being noticed if they manage to pass advanced workshop courses and make money for the prison. However, more interpersonal elements are going to be added in future builds, most notably gangs.\n\nThis does bring up that "early access" tag that you see on the store page. While the game is enjoyable as it stands, it is definitely not complete. Bugs range from amusing (inmates tearing off their clothes and gleefully streaking through the halls to the showers) to annoying (workers walking through walls and sometimes getting items they carry stuck there) to baffling (trees suddenly growing in the middle of my kitchen, only to be dumped in a garbage bag and thrown away). There is also a certain amount of optimization to be done. The devs have said that they plan to drop the price upon full release, so if that's a major consideration for you, then I'd suggest waiting for release or at least a sizeable sale. I bought it myself on the last sale for about $10, and it's easily worth the full, current price to me.\n\nIn summary, if you enjoy simulators at all, I urge you to check this game out. I highly doubt you'll be disappointed.\n\nUPDATES:\nAlpha 21: Drug addiction is a good addition to the game. It doesn't feel really fleshed out at the moment, though, and is more of an annoyance than anything else. My prisons generally don't get to the point of riots, but I'm glad that those mechanics are more subtle now.","May 27, 2014","true","52.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Once your prison gets to about 300+ people it's not just as smooth as when you first start playing. It's not jerky by any means but not 100% silky smooth all the time.

Prison Architect proves that there is not only interest in strategy/planning games but a talented team of designers who are willing meet that demand. Introversion Software has not only proven that they are a talented team but also that their game “Prison Architect” will be cared for and become the smash hit that it clearly is, anything less would be a crime.\n\nEDIT  -This was written before update 1.0","October 7, 2015","true","102.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

What can go wrong? Alot, as it turns out. the basis of the game is to make your prisoners happy while making money on your prison, ever expanding to contain more and more prisoners. As it's early-access, there are various bugs, minor details that need explaining, and, of course, more content. As it stands, though, it is solid and fun, and the modding community adds alot to it as well.","December 12, 2013","true","37.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

If you have ever been a fan of any Sim City style games where you build your city (in this case a prison!) then this is a game I highly reccomend you try to get your hands on. It offers hours of gameplay currently, and only has room to improve from here.\n\nBuilding a prison and managing it's day to day operations from having enough meals cooked to letting your prisons have family members visit. Chasing escapee's, calling in SWAT for riots, or watching your prison burn to the ground.... there are just so many possibilities. Since I have purchased the game I have seen the numerous updates from the developers pushing out new content, improving old content, and fixing bugs. As far as the team behind this game goes, they really seem to care about their game and the people who play it.\n\nPersonally, I feel the 29.99 price tag is a little steep if you ask me, so I would wait until it goes on sale to buy this. Thankfully the developer seems to be more concerned with having a good product that more fans get to enjoy than making money so this game ends up on sales pretty often.","October 20, 2013","true","100.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Once I get my prison so big (40+ prisoners) and my staff gets pretty big...... the AI just pukes and dies....\n\nThe maintenance workers and janitors cease to function.  They just pile up together and vibrate erratically.\n\nAnd thus with no maintenance or janitorial services, the prison falls into chaos.\n\nIt has done this with every attempt.\n\nI have gathered this game was programmed by a couple of dudes...  and given the installed game files consist of about 8 files total (a couple dll's, a few dat's and an exe), it is quite obvious.\n\nThis is a very amature piece of software.

Oh, and don't expect anything crazy when you intentionally destroy your prison by not feeding your prisoners.  You'll be left disappointed.\n\nAt the moment, I can't recommend this just based on the development speed.  I've been keeping my eye on it and watching each patch, but they're never anything substantial and only amount to:\n1. Bug fixes\n2. One new feature (e.g. Alpha 15 implemented guard dogs, and an entire forum post was dedicated to dogs.)\nThese sorts of patches are fine, but they come at a pace of one every 1-2 months** , so one has to wonder how much actual work gets done in the office.\n\nMods are advertised with the Steam Workshop, but unless you want to add more money (grants) or change how the game looks, you'll be disappointed.  I scanned through the prisoner files in hopes that I could change prisoner behavior (Random riots from unstable prisoners, anyone?), but I was left disappointed.\n\nI would wait a long time on this one.  At the current pace, the game won't be finished for several more years.\n\nSide note:  This is one problem with Early Access.  This game is potentially very good, and people see that: It has already sold well.  Now the devs are free to take their time, which is great.  But you can't count on everyone to have a strong work ethic when they have no deadlines to meet and they've already been paid.\n\n\n\n**Update:\nI had some misinformation in my original review.\n\nOne to two months was slightly incorrect, but the game has a monthly update cycle.\nhttp://www.introversion.co.uk/prisonarchitect/builds.html\n\nThere has been only one instance where updates took two months, so I apologize for my incorrect statement.\n\nHere's the list of new features over the past 6 months:\n\nAug13- Prisoners dig out, punishment settings\nOct13- Guard dogs\nNov13- Mods, staff fatigue\nDec13- Segregate prison, share mods.\n(It's worth noting that segregation of prisoners was completely useless at the time)\nJan 14 - Shotgun guards\nFeb 14 - Rehab programs for prisoners\n\n\nThat is the pace of this game, and it's a fact.  I find the updates to be incredibly slow from a feature standpoint.  Some may disagree, but I find the game to be barebones when taken as a whole.  I am NOT disputing the game's alpha status.  It is definitely that.  I firmly believe the game will be a solid title at some point.  It's just that, considering the rate of development of this title, I cannot recommend purchasing it at this time.","January 30, 2014","false","12.9"," 420 of 828 people (51%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","51","420","828","9","25"

Sick of all the chores they make you do? Don't you just feel like your house is a prison?\n\nNow you have a way to vent your frustrations and take them out on a bunch of 2D-sprites of randomly generated criminals! Prison Architect puts you in the role of... well, in that of a prison architect. You are charged with designing the layout of your penitentiary, including not only the cells, but also the canteen, kitchens, workshops, visitation centres, staff rooms and offices and much, much more. This is a game not only for creative people, but also for smart ones, as you are able to assign specific staff to areas you designate for them, set up patrol-routes and daily schedules. When do your prisoners get to eat? What do they get to eat? When do they work, when are they free to do whatever? All of this is decided by you.\n\nThe simplistic graphics of PA only contribute to the meticulous planning you will find yourself doing after two or three failed attempts. Where do I put the utilities? How should I lay down the big water pipes and connect all the toilets and showers to water supply? How will I prevent contraband from being smuggled in, or tunnels from being dug at night? The amount of things being simulated is simply astonishing. Plus, every month or so, the developers hammer out a big update, bringing fresh content and overhauls to the game's most severe issues. While still in early access, PA is very well playable and worth a look into for all of you who enjoy simulations with advanced supply chains and in-depth planning.","December 27, 2013","true","139.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

'Realistic' mode is cool, but it is taking a long time to build all stuff you want, if you are creative - so I found more enjoyable 'Sandbox' mode, in which you have unlimited funds, so you can build whatever you want, no matter how big or complex it is going to be.

You don't just build a prison, you also manage one. You can have multiple save profiles active at once and the fact that the game can last for a very long time due to no end to the game.

Don't let the simple, but cute character graphics, or the fact that it is early access fool you. This is a fully fleshed out game with hours and hours of playing enjoyment. I have had no issues with game stability or bugs of any kind.\n\n(I did have a prisoner who got shanked in the mess hall and the doctor could not get to his body as it was on a dining table covered by food trays from other prisoners eating their lunch off of his unconcious body. I just sentenced him to solitary cell punishment, and a guard came and dragged him off the table.)\n\nI am at just under 50 hours of play time, and I am on my third prison. You build your prison up, get it running smoothly, then sell it and take the funds to start your next prison. Your first couple of prisons will be just cutting your teeth and learning how everything works. It wasn't until my current prison build that I started utilizing automated doors controlled by a couple guards in a security room. without this, your guards have to tend to the gates and doors everytime someone needs to pass.\n\nThis game has a suprising amount of depth and intricacy, but is forgiving enough for even the casual gamer. You can invest as little or as much time and have just as much fun. Spending less time refining the systems of the prison simply leads to more fights and riots, and hey, that's a lot of fun too!\n\nFair warning! You will be compelled to spend much more time playing this game than you think. It's hard to stop when there is so many interesting things going on. If you like simulation games, you must play this game! I bought it during the Exploration Sale and I got so much more than my money's worth.

It's all about managing a company and making a profit, only this time you're not trying to make people laugh and scream in your rollercoaster or treating strange diseases. It's about making sure that your inmates are cared for and don't escape or riot.\n\nI love this game and I've put about 45 hours in it in only about a week, but I think there are much room for more features and improvements. We can't know what the game will be like in the final version but so far it looks really promising. The game is absolutely playable in its current state and if you like this building and managing a company kind of games I'll gladly recommend you to buy it.","January 6, 2015","true","95.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Endless fun can be found in this game for just a simple concept; build and maintain your prison and perhpas make a profit along the way.\n\nWith the availability of mods now the game can be expanded in ways to give you more options. Something I enjoy is that I installed a map that starts with max money cap. I use this prison to mess around with and test concepts to avoid destroying my actual prison.\n\nI would highly reccomend that gamers who enjoy strategy games should try this game out.

I was having a bit of an overcrowding issue so I started to build more cell blocks.  While I was busy with that a prisoner snuck a knife out of the canteen.

They broke into my armory and began attacking the gaurds and each other.  After a hard fought battle my gaurds managed to lock up the prisoners again.  We had only sustained seven casualties in the altercation.  However, the prisoners had been reduced down to only sixteen.

Sick of all the chores they make you do? Don't you just feel like your house is a prison?\n\nNow you have a way to vent your frustrations and take them out on a bunch of 2D-sprites of randomly generated criminals! Prison Architect puts you in the role of... well, in that of a prison architect. You are charged with designing the layout of your penitentiary, including not only the cells, but also the canteen, kitchens, workshops, visitation centres, staff rooms and offices and much, much more. This is a game not only for creative people, but also for smart ones, as you are able to assign specific staff to areas you designate for them, set up patrol-routes and daily schedules. When do your prisoners get to eat? What do they get to eat? When do they work, when are they free to do whatever? All of this is decided by you.\n\nThe simplistic graphics of PA only contribute to the meticulous planning you will find yourself doing after two or three failed attempts. Where do I put the utilities? How should I lay down the big water pipes and connect all the toilets and showers to water supply? How will I prevent contraband from being smuggled in, or tunnels from being dug at night? The amount of things being simulated is simply astonishing. Plus, every month or so, the developers hammer out a big update, bringing fresh content and overhauls to the game's most severe issues. While still in early access, PA is very well playable and worth a look into for all of you who enjoy simulations with advanced supply chains and in-depth planning.","December 27, 2013","true","139.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a real nice dificulty curve making it easy to step in and dificult to manage at scale (just as a game should be) overall it has become one of my favorites to play even with it being early access\n\nI do have a few things that I wanted to note these are by and large little items figured this would be an avenue for communication they are at WORST annoyances and probably already in the development packages\n\nThings they could fix:\n1) Some building bugs (Thing like builders getting stuck can make the game a bit frustrating)\n2) Dead body removal process overall annoying a bit more so one game (I had a firefighter die in a fire on the road blocking traffic with his body and truck never leaving so blocking further emergency vehicles)\n3) Power generator not being able to be tied into the same grid (this is a mechanic not a bug fix) this totally confused me for a while not knowing that plugging two into the same grid results on both shutting down\n\n\nOverall the game is highly recommended by me its a tone of fun and really looking forward to the next patch to see what more they bring!","November 28, 2013","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dungeon keeper, sims style, simcity style all in a pretty simple prison sim. Unlike prison tycoon one through five this prison sim keeps things simple and enjoyable despite being in alpha. It does come with bugs, lots of bugs but that's what you get for early access alpha games. As for it being buggy it plays and is still able to trap the player and take what little time you have.\n\nAs of right now its a solid 7/10 and once they iron out most the bugs and send it out as a final game package I can foresee a 9/10 being a must have for old time dungeon keeper sim builders out there.","December 1, 2013","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think this game is in good shape for and alpha and is very well coded and i can see the team worked really hard on it. There are a few things that would make the expreince much better. I think its quite annoying how fog of war is automatticly checked on when you create a new prison, and that you cant switch it off once youve created it, mostly becuase you dont notcie that its on up until youve already built youre prison. And i think that not having the ability to decide on how many prisoners you want to take in is also an issue, becuase they always come in batches of eight or more, and it makes it very annoying when you only have room for a few more, sometimes they even come in at 24 prisoners at once, even when you dont have that many cells in the first place. Other than those two big issues, i think the game is fun and enjoyable, and that anyone who enjoyes sandbox games should try it out.\n\nHere are some of my ideas for content in the game:\n-The ability to make multy floored buildings\n-Work camps for your prisoners\n-Therapy rooms\n-Pools\n-A theater for your prisoners to express theyre creative side\n-And an indoor workout facility","December 1, 2013","true","31.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, there is a lot of fun in planning out your prison, learning what is needed and where to put it, and managing all your prisoners. It can be overwhelming, but the more you play, the more you learn what you need to do to maintain control.","December 1, 2013","true","22.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's about it :D. It kept me busy for hours when I started, trying to figure out how to run the prison without everyone stabbing everything. Once I got that down, money was the next problem, but that gets sorted pretty quick with licence plates. Then from there on in, it becomes a bit of a waiting game for money. Not the worst wait as you can watch your handy work being stable, but does become a bit dull.\n\nAll in all though it's a decent game, and is worth the money. I think in future this game will become a favorite, but for now it still needs some time.

This IS IN NO WAY A FINISHED GAME.\nIt shows quite a bit of potential, and even in it's often comically broken state I've had hours of fun with it. Introversion has a great track record, and if progress keeps going like it has been it's going to be an awesome game at release time.\n\nDo: buy it if you fully understand it's alpha quality software and has a tiny team developing it.\nDon't: buy it if you're expending a full featured or even particularly stable experience.","December 5, 2013","true","215.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
