"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kevinknows/recommended/464760/","kevinknows","Maggie Greene","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kevinknows/","409 products in account","A very cute and simple game, but there are a lot of things that needs to be improved on.\n\nFor starters, it's practically a gamble to guess which blocks you could actually stand on - and that could REALLY risk you your game. Apparently you can step on flowers but not trees. Okay.\n\nSecondly, the controls are a bit odd, making the game unnecessarily tough. It's not uncommon for you to lose because you fail to jump on a cloud (because you REALLY have to aim for it's top) and end up landing on spikes. Also ended up getting stuck on flowers a few times.\n\nThird, lives are practically useless - you restart from the beginning if you die anyway. they serve no purpose whatsoever other than to save you time from going back to the menu and selecting the level again.\n\nFourth, There are very, very little help for new players in the beginning. Yes, the game shows you which key to press when you open the game - but that screen barely lasts for like a second. I had to restart the game like three times to read it to figure out which key I have to press to shoot (it's the down arrow key by the way, which is highly unusual). In fact, I didn't even know I could shoot until about ten minutes into the game, which was when I realized the monster placements are far too ridiculous for there not to be a way for players to kill them.\n\nFifth, the game lacks a 'tutorial' level for new players to get used to the game. The very first level, it ruthlessly throws you into a full-on game where you have to collect literally 70 lemon blocks or whatever it's called (barely read what the guy in the beginning said since it's one big, clumped wall of text with no punctuation whatsoever).\n\nOverall, the game is cute and it definitely has some potential, and I would recommend it to people if what I wrote above got fixed - but otherwise I wouldn't really bother with it. I really dig the music though. Super fun and bright.","April 29","true","8.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/-tsukiko/recommended/464760/","-tsukiko","Tsukiko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/-tsukiko/","1428 products in account","Simple pixel art and platformer. Controls needs some getting used to as it is fixed but it will be best if it can be customizable.\n\nYou press the arrow keys to move around and jump, and the down button to shoot. I would prefer the spacebar to shoot though. Press P to pause the game.\n\nIt is a pretty tough game despite the simplicity of the game as you have limited lives and the traps are pretty well thought out and placed. (You have to learn the map in order to achieve high scores)\n\nSome minor issues; platforms and obstacles need some improvement in the art to show the player which are the platforms you can actually stand on.\n\nFor the price, it is a good purchase for some retro good ol' fun.","April 29","true","3.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

Since i'm not a pixel gamer i liked and find this game very cute, enjoyable and laughable.  Have simple challeging, control, colours and moves. The sound is super perfect and addictive. This game maybe or might require use with a controller but I was satisfied using keyboard(I am used to it) without no problem. The price fits perfectly and i would recommend this game to anyone.","May 8","true","27.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"
