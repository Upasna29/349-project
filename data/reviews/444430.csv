"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/444430/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","Zeus Vs Monster is a game that could be used for schools, that's why I have it in my library. Besides, practicing maths skills and discovering the Greek mythology is a nice mix. I've also seen that a French version was available, which is a serious lacking feature for many educational products. Besides, the game exists also on Android, iOS and Mac, which covers many devices.\n\nYou're Zeus or Athena depending on your choice of Hero and your goal is to beat enemes coming to you by answering correctly to the proposed calculs. Every five levels, a mythological creature is also appearing, with some details about it and is the ending boss.\n\nWhat's good is that the French version is only necessary at these moments. However, the translation may be correct but isn't still perfect as many faults are present.\n\nYou can adjust the difficulty, not in the settings though. Indeed, for the developers, the difficulty equals the speed of the enemies. Besides, changing this parameter during a playthrough will launch a new save file, without erasing your progression in other difficulties.\n\nIf you want harder calculs, before each play, you can choose the operations you want to show, the range of numbers (0-10 for the addition for example, multiply/divide by 1,2,5,10, etc..). That's where the game is very interesting, as not a lot of them propose a precise configuration. Also, you can follow how many answers were right or wrong in each of these parameters.\n\nMy big negative point is probably the fact that the help isn't clear. I mean, I've seen that you can use ASD or the arrows or the mouse. But in my head, I didn't associate these (apart the mouse) for answering the questions, it was for me to move my character. In reality, A/left arrow is for choosing the left answer, S/down arrow is for the middle one and D/right arrow is for the right one. I would have preferred a title saying that it was the commands to answer so that my brain didn't switch automatically in my usual habits in gaming.\n\nGraphically, the game is correct. The soundtrack is also enjoyable.\n\nZeus Vs Monsters is a nice game about maths, thanks to the difficulty management that is precise and to the little entertainement to learn about mythological creatures, even if I can be a little disappointed in the translation. I can see the game to be used as a drill or as a reward.","February 29","true","1.0"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","15","30","0","0"
