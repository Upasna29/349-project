It's my favorite visual novel.\n\nThe interface is great and comfortable, there is a good selection of Extras, like CGI and even Windows soundpacks and even icons. On a technical standpoint, it's a great game.\n\nI may not have many hours on this (Unless a R-18 patch is released, or created by the users) - but I have played it.\n\nNow with the story, it has its fair share of funny moments, and its fair share of dramatic moments..as well as those moments that had me on the brink of tears, or just depressed for multiple days.\n\nAmane's route is outstanding. One issue in this version is that you're missing out on the adult content, which is coincidentally a large focus of her route. Though, there is also a lot of humor and fun in this version without any adult content. I will not spoil Amane's route at all because it's something that you truly have to experience for yourself. When I first played through her route, I only got 2 hours of sleep for 2 nights in a row, just because of how interested I was. It's amazing.\n\nSachi's route is very good, it's interesting finding out exactly what drives her to act as she does, just make sure that you are ready for the reason. Try not to get the bad ending for her, though..truly horrifying. I don't know fully how to put how I feel about her route into words, but I assure you that it's great. The R-18 content here does not matter as much, I believe- though in general I do believe that not having it is a general issue.\n\nYumiko's route is nice, she's sort of like a tsundere/kuudere mix in personality, and her route is generally good, but not exceptionally remarkable overall. I enjoyed her route a lot, especially in seeing how she slowly becomes close to you, or Yuuji. Nearing the end a lot of unexpected things happen, and it is all played out pretty well, but once again, when you compare it to something like Amane's route, it's hard to stand out. However, I still enjoyed it a lot.\n\nI have not yet completed Makina's route, though it is pretty good so far. Lots of humor, and a lot of dark stuff as well. Each route has two sides, and they are all generally played out well. R-18 content here as far as I have gone doesn't matter at all, but I can't say for sure since I have not yet completed it.\n\nI have not started Michiru's route, but some people argue that it is the best route in the entire game. Others argue that Amane's route is the best. They're generally the two most acclaimed in this game.\n\nOverall, there was not a single moment in which I wanted to just get through a certain part to get to the good stuff so to speak. The entire experience was perfect, from the comedy to the pure horror at some points in time, everything was great. I do not have a single complaint for this game, but it goes without saying that the R-18 version is the definitive version to get.\n\nIf you're looking for an outstanding visual novel that will last you over 50 hours of gameplay-\n\n(Yes, even with quick reading)\n\nlook no further than Grisaia no Kajitsu, or "The Fruit of Grisaia"","May 30, 2015","true","1.3"," 266 of 298 people (89%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","89","266","298","18","14"

I got it because it was recommended by some folks who supported its creation, and I've read through the "good" and "bad" endings of four of the characters.\n\nI think the best way to put it is that this game is emotionally wrecking.  I'd go so far to say life-changing if I didn't think people would scoff and pass it off as a joke or something.  If you read this visual novel, you're going to see five really well written characters who all have something to hide.  The male protagonist isn't any better himself, but each time you select a path in this novel, his history comes more and more to light.\n\nEach character suffers.  They suffer a lot.  From ♥♥♥♥♥♥ parents, desperate situations and impossible expectations, each character has their own personal hell waiting to be explored.  I think if you can relate to any of the characters, you'll find yourself hysterical with grief in their story.  If you want a sappy love story straight out of bland Slice of Life manga, this is not for you.  If you want a love story full of personal dysfunction, innuendo, snipers, bombers, politicans, child hood friends, psuedo-tsunderes, and a lot of karate chopping between friends, this visual novel is the best there is at the time of this review's writing.\n\nAs sick as it may sound, this game has been an emotionally therapeutic experience.  If you've ever had a problem with family, guilt or grief, it's worth picking up the game for the writer's perspectives on the matters.","June 7, 2015","true","72.4"," 136 of 143 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","136","143","2","0"

The story is a long and rambling account of a strange guy going to an obscure school of only five weird female students. Yes the setup is absurd, but Fruit of Grisaia knows it and goes with it.\n\nAs a novel I have to say how good the writing is since it is often thought provoking and emotionally touching. The problem is that those good moments are amongst a sea of silly-stupid encounters with those girls. That sillyness is fine if you like over-the-top Japanese cutesy schtick, but it's incredibly annoying if you don't. All the girls are to some degree frustrating-annoying with the Micharu girl being way off the scale. Michiru is so bad she is obnoxious. Makina is annoying but you later learn about her inner demons and why she is who she is. In fact, all of the main characters have their backstories developed wonderfully. Every character has their own genuine motives, wow. Micharu is still a pain in the ♥♥♥.\n\nOther than the story: the art is lovely and each of the characters can be individually muted. Use the scroll wheel down to advance the story.\n\nOverall I admit I like Fruit of Grisaia. I give it a 7 out of I-Don't-Do-Scores.","July 18, 2015","true","3.0"," 122 of 138 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","122","138","8","1"

I was expecting writing up with the likes of Clannad and Little Busters.\n\nThat being said, it's still very good. I would say the character routes are, in fact, more intriguing and in-depth than the character routes from aforementioned visual novels by far.\n\nFirst off, this visual novel does not have a true ending. The story leads somewhere entirely different based on which girl's route you choose. This is a very character-oriented visual novel.\n\nSecond, this visual novel does not have a lot of choice-making. The choices you have to make are pretty much limited to route branches and good/bad endings. While this is not a negative thing during the characters' routes, it could possibly have some impact on the very long common route if you are a person who would like to branch off into a character's route as soon as possible, or like to re-read parts of the common route and see what would happen if you made a different choice.\n\nThird, the soundtrack is very good. Some visual novels tend to have a pretty forgettable soundtrack with the exception of a few major tracks (I'm looking at you, Sharin no Kuni, Himawari no Shoujo), but that is not the case with this one. It's one of those soundtracks where it's easy to hear that it belongs to The Fruit of Grisaia.\n\nFourth and last, the artwork is very pretty. The backgrounds and the CG are top quality. Couldn't ask for any improvements on those. After you complete a girls route you even unlock system voices, icons, and desktop wallpapers related to that character.\n\nMakina is best character na no yo sa","June 14, 2015","true","481.4"," 66 of 73 people (90%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","90","66","73","13","19"

Definitely a great mix of comedy, drama and romance!"\n\nThe Fruit of Grisaia is the first of the Grisaia Trilogy. The Fruit of Grisaia is a visual novel where you take the role of transfer student, Kazami Yuuji as he enters Mihama Academy and hopes for an "ordinary" school life. As the story progresses, you will come upon the 5 heroines of the novel namely: Sakaki Yumiko, Suou Amane, Komine Sachi, Matsushima Michiru and Irisu Makina. Each heroine has their own unique story and personality.\n\nAs said by most players, this is a very long visual novel with a lineup of up to 32 scenes/chapters on the common route alone excluding the around 17+ scenes/chapters for the heroine's actual arc. The price of the game is well worth it because aside from its very long content, it also features the whole CG Gallery, Scene Replay and Music Collection unlike other Visual Novels in Steam where the CG Gallery and other features are removed from the actual VN. I finished this Visual Novel by around 50+ hours. After finishing one of the 5 arcs, you'll also unlock a Secret feature but I'll let you see it for yourself once you get your own copy of The Fruit of Grisaia.\n\nI recommend this game to big fans of visual novels. This ain't for you if you can't stand to read a lot of content because this is really a very long novel. The content of the novel is very well written and packs quite a lot of humor. Each chapter/scene, whether its a common route or a heroine's arc, is very much worth every minute of your time. From the cuteness of Yumiko to Michiru's clumsiness, the novel will give you quite a feel of watching an actual anime episode. If you're looking for some humor with a mix of drama and feels, this is one of Steam's best Visual Novel available! If you don't believe me, then see and feel it for yourself!\n\nMy Personal Rating:Story/Plot: 10/10\nMusic: 10/10\nGraphics: 9/10\nCharacters: 9/10\n\nOverall: 9.5/10","July 30, 2015","true","62.8"," 55 of 62 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","55","62","4","0"

Keep this in mind as you read my review. This is going to be as spoiler free as I can make it.\n\nThe Fruit of Grisaia (Grisaia no Kajitsu) is more or less a picture book about a battle-hardened child soldier attempting to return to a normal life. I'm sure most people are thinking the same thing I was, "If I wanted to spend $30 on a book, I'd want a physical copy and it better be good." Well, while the former isn't possible, the latter is completely true. VN games always turned me off, before; lack of action, lack of many choices, pure focus on story, lots of reasons that I'm sure many people share. Despite all the reasons for not wanting this game, I found myself returning to the store page every now and then. I finally managed to grab it for around $12, and I feel like I ripped off the developer. This game is well worth the full price, and probably over. Just about every character, no matter how minor a part they play, has a personality. You either hate a character, like a character, or love a character - and not always for good reasons. The 5 classmates - Yumiko, Makina, Amane, Sachi, and Michiru - are all perfectly unique. There's almost no "copy/paste" idea present. The interactions between characters seem extremely natural, as well. I refrained from writing a review until I had finished every route the game had(other than the bad routes), and I found it harder and harder to do that as I progressed. Despite the circumstances of each of the characters, you can relate to every single one of them. I often found myself caught off guard when a character said "Yuuji", because I was so engrossed in the story that I had actually assumed the role of the main character. The replay value is pretty decent, as well. I'd love to travel through this story once more. The scenes often invoke emotions you can't imagine; I laughed at the most ridiculous things, I cried when things happened, I even felt myself worrying about the characters. By playing through the dating routes, I realized a common theme is that none of the bad stuff would've happened if Yuuji(you) hadn't showed up or made the choice to interfere. That caused a feeling of hopelessness and self-doubt in me, as well. That being said, I highly recommend playing through every girl's route. You learn more about not only the girls, but Yuuji as well. As you learn more about the circumstances for each girl being there, you learn about Yuuji's own past; a past he keeps hidden away. If you don't find the emotional aspect convincing enough, this game teaches practical knowledge, as well. I learned self-defense techniques, how to deal with women, and survival and cooking skills, to name a few. I can't remember the last time I learned something I could use in everyday life from a video game, aside from a profound lesson on human nature or a phylisophical idea. I'm currently letting my little brother play through himself, and he is the typical "COD AKSHUN POW POW GUN FIRE GIT GUD SKRUB" gamer. He loves it so much I had to threaten to take the computer away in order to write this review. I also plan on buying a couple copies for my close friends, and sharing this experience with them. I have fallen in love with this game, and it has sparked an interest within me for other VN's. If you see a Visual Novel in my library, it's because of Fruit of Grisaia.\n\nTL;DR: 10/10 Would buy full price. Get this game. Even if you hate VN's.","September 26, 2015","true","99.2"," 51 of 61 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","51","61","4","0"

In Kajitsu the story begins with the protagonist Kazumi Yuuji transferring into a certain school and meeting 5 other girls who attends it. There are only 6 students the school.\nIt gives off a very unique feel, unlike all other school-related VNs. The heroines are, unique, eccentric and weird in some way or another. To be precise, the entire school is full of weirdos, even Yuuji himself.\n\nThe common route is entertaining and really intresting, because the characters are all weirdos like with Michiru's stupidity, Sachi's lack of common sense, Makina's downright rude personality, Amane's horny big sister role player,Yumiko's "classic kuudere."  and Yuuji's tsundere personality.\n\nIt has good voice acting and all of the heroines and have nice soundtracks.\nThe art style is very pleasing to the eye and with vivid colours being used it makes a nice ambience around the visual novel itself.\nThe interface is very detailed and nicely designed.\n\nTo sum up i would definitely recommend this great title from Frontwing, The Fruit of Grisaia isn’t a game to be missed, and whether you’re a fan of visual novels, anime, or even just well-written stories, this is something that’ll be a deep, engaging experience.\n\nFull review click here[azusantiara.com]","May 30, 2015","true","273.0"," 54 of 73 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","54","73","7","4"

I got interested in this VN because of the anime. I  loved the humor that contrasted some pretty dark moments. That's not to say the VN here lacks that humor. It's just that the VN spends a lot more time with those dark elements. Overall its heavier than the anime. What does that have to do with the steam version? Some claim that in addition to the removal of the adult scenes that some of the more lewd humor was edited from the script. It's quite possible this happened even before it was translated. So I'm not pointing fingers. Just makes me wish I had bought the denpa version (which I will probably still buy since I do like this series).\n\nI honestly thought I wouldn't mind the cut adult scenes since the denpa version is censored anyways. But in hindsight I've come to realize that, lewd or not, cut content is lame. Seriously. The fade to blacks are jarring and you inevitably end up wondering what happened when the characters make subtle references after the fact. So, yeah, mosaics suck but cuts are worse, imo.\n\nThat all said its still a solid game with a lengthy story. I'd give this version a 6/10 (8/10 if it was the full version)\n\n+Good Art\n+Great story\n+Great humor at times\n+-There's one character just can't bring myself to like. On the other hand they have considerable depth despite some cliche trappings.\n+-Be ready for the onions\n+-Be prepared for some extended backstory flashbacks that get a little heavy handed when setting the mood. Like the writer wanted to be extra sure you got the intended tone.\n+-In general all the characters are well developed but I sometimes had to roll my eyes at the suspension of disbelief breaking extremes\n-Cut content (Cut in Japan)\n-Wish there was a little more variety to the soundtrack (the tracks aren't bad just got fatigued)\n-Wish MC was voiced. I know that's not common for VN's but in this case he's such a boss and I did see the anime first\n-Sadly there seems to still be some minor bugs/translation issues. I ran across a couple. The worst of which rendered a conversation's text and audio out of sync for quite a while. I understand this game has a pretty large script but they've had a lot of time to fix stuff like this.\n\n*edit* Couple more pro/con.

Originally released in 2011 in Nipland and developed by Frontwing, now one of the great Visual Novel is available in Steam! Thx based Sekai Project. It is one of the visual novel that requires your attention and interest in the medium because it's at least gonna waste around 50 hours of your time.\n\nIs this VN worth your 50 hours tho? The answer is yes. Having already read the whole Grisaia trilogy and still buying Kajitsu on Steam after I finished reading it 3 years ago means I support the developer for their great work that is gone into making this game.\n\nGrisaia no Kajitsu has a total of 5 routes for each heroine with their own bad ends and good ends. The five heroines are Suou Amane, Sakaki Yumiko, Komine Sachi, Matsushima Michiru & Irisu Makina. Each one of this heroine has their own distinctive persona and are interesting on their own. Of course each one of them has a problem, which is why the 5 of them goes to Mihama Academy in the first place. As for the MC, Kazami  Juicy  Yuuji is a bad-♥♥♥ based protagonist that has his own secret for coming to Mihama Academy. What's his problem for coming to Mihama Academy though is the biggest secret and it's pretty much driving power for the wild ride in the later Grisaia series (Meikyuu and Rakuen).\n\nThe story starts out slow and quite long. Actually tbh I enjoyed the common route more than the heroines route, whether that's a bad thing or a good thing I don't know. The jokes are funny and the heroine interaction with the MC and each other friend is quite lively. There aren't that many choices in the common route, because once a choice starts appearing, that means you're about to enter the heroine route and it's a long, long reading before you start seeing the choice. Each heroines has their own problem and they're interesting to read but the only route I'm having problem is Makina's route, their chemistry is sooo good as a father and daughter, but the developer had to f*ck it up by  having the two of them f*ck , I don't know how they're gonna solve it in this release (Steam version) since this is the All-Age version of Kajitsu, other than that the other heroine's problem is fleshed out properly and have their own nice ending to it. Yumiko is the best grill for me :^) but Amane's story is my favorite.\n\nAs for the arts and soundtrack for this Visual Novel, I actually interested in Grisaia because Fumio is one of the two main character designer, and the other one is Akio Watanabe which is known for Monogaytari series. Fumio is the main artist for my favorite visual novel called Tomoyo After ~It's a Wonderful Life~ (pls Sekai Project bring this VN to Steam), To top it off, the seiyuu for Yumiko is the same seiyuu for Sakagami Tomoyo in Tomoyo After. Coincidence? I think there's something much more powerful behind this :^) The soundtrack gives a nice support to make the scene very lively especially in the common route where the BGM is pretty upbeat and fun.\n\nA must read Visual Novel if you're looking for a good story, it's worth all your 50 hours and with its current price ($40) it should worth more than your typical AAA releases that only last for 6-12 hours long campaign but  ONLY  if you know the medium and interested in Action and SoL drama story. I didn't back this project on Kickstater because I spent the money for Rewrite and high electricity bill because based Winter is too cold, otherwise I would've backed it and get the Trilogy for $90.\n\nHere, a spoiler for you if you want to know what is the meaning of Grisaia,  it's an island bought under the name of  Kusakabe Asako  as a special gift for Juicy. Who is  Asako?  Read Meikyuu naow or w8 translation later lel . Also you should try a VN titled Time Leap by Frontwing, it's pretty good and the graphic on that game is... should I say,  interesting.\n\n>tfw I read Grisaia no Kajitsu 3 years ago\nI feel old naow ;-;\nReminder not to watch the Anime, just read this Visual Novel, it's way, wayy more better than the Anime.","May 30, 2015","true","52.2"," 49 of 70 people (70%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","70","49","70","9","0"

It's literally a million words long. For comparison, the typical (written, book-style) novel is at least 40,000 words long.\n\nWith that in mind, The Fruit of Grisaia is a tremendously well-written work, and is absolutely worth your time. The characters are living, breathing human beings, and they've all got hugely interesting backstories. One small criticism I have of the game is that it's sometimes a little tonally inconsistent - in a few of the routes, the tone swings from "yay! upbeat and happy!" to "holy ♥♥♥♥, I want to go lie in bed and cry for a while" without any warning. But I suppose that's a huge part of the story's design: that it lures the player in with a cliched premise (first male student in a female-only high school) and keeps the player interested by telling one hell of a complex and interesting story.\n\nI rate this visual novel a 9 out of 10, and as a visual novel producer, I've gotta say, it's a huge inspiration to me.

There will also be minor spoilers ahead, you’ve been warned!\nThis VN is a story about a person who has had a very deep past about himself and his family. He gets enrolled to a “special” school where he meets 5 girls (I know, typical VN right?) and gets to know them better as the story progress further. You also get to know the story behind the girls, why they are in this school, their past etc. This is quite a unique style as most VNs have a style of “get the guy, forget everything else” thing, this VN actually puts you in a realistic environment as the Main Character (MC). All the girls have a different personality (Again, very typical here), but they are all very loveable and picking a route to complete can require some thought as it feel like you need to do all of them.\n\nOkay for the actual features now\nGraphics: 10/10\nOverall artwork, design and CGI elements are all on point. The visuals themselves are very appealing to the eye, as you would see in the anime (If you’ve seen the anime). There is nothing else much to say…the art is just too good.\n\nStoryline: 8/10\nAs I mentioned above, this will heavily focus more on Makina’s Route. As for the common route, this is just the stepping stone for getting to know the characters, the setting and the general story. It is very long and some chapters take a long time (Sometimes an hour) to be completed. Some of the chapters focus on each of the characters which is nice for getting to know them.\nNow, as for Makina’s Route. It starts off as “This might actually go well for us” feeling until you get around chapter 8 of the route and realise that the situation is harder to handle than usual. This route is filled with a lot of in depth character perception and by this point a lot of character development as arisen, nice touch. JB, Makina’s Mother and The Irisu Clan are also heavily involved with this route as well as the MC A.K.A “9029” by the company he works for. The story does get a little complicated between the relation of Makina and the Irisu Clan, which made the entire route seem a little off. It also splits in a few parts in which it shouldn’t have, making it harder to understand than it already is. There is also a reason why Makina needs to be alive, but the clan wants her dead, but this reason wasn’t mentioned right until the end which was frustrating as it was such as important note.\nThere is a good and bad ending to this route (As well as in the other routes). Your choice at the end of the route will affect the ending, so save before choosing. I did manage to do both the good and the bad ending. The good ending, well as from the name, is “good” in a way. The bad ending however didn’t feel like a “bad” ending per se, it felt more like a “neutral” ending to be honest. But overall, this route was really solid and well made.\n\nSound: 9/10\nSoundtracks including the OP theme, the menu soundtrack and the in-game scene soundtrack were very nice sounding, most were almost on point in the scene. It is not quite perfect as in some scenes (Tiny amount maybe only 4-5), they could’ve made better soundtracks in the situation. In this case it gets a solid score, very well done.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nIt is a solidly built with all the features a VN would ever need, some are even beyond the boundaries of the VN like a feature to optimise up to 3 monitors, which is completely unnecessary, but great otherwise. There is the usual speed text slider which works absolutely fine, I did find the faster speeds still a little too slow, but they’re good enough as they are. You also have full voiced support (Except for the MC), you can turn them off if you wanted to, change the volume and turn off some and keep the others on (Great if you want to role-play) as one or more of the characters.\nUnfortunately, the SHIFT + TAB feature doesn’t work as great, sometimes it opens, sometimes it doesn’t and sometimes it would slow down the game as if it was going to lag or about to crash, not a pleasant experience. I would suggest just using ALT +TAB is you want to switch between the game itself and something like a group chat, this way the game doesn’t get affect at all. This is VN, but for some reason idle FPS is usually around 25-30 FPS, I don’t know why, but this value should be at 60 FPS, not 25-30 FPS. Not saying it doesn’t reach 60 FPS, it does, but only when you are constantly reading, but even if you leave it idling for 5 seconds, it would dip down to 25 FPS at the lowest.\n\nPrice: 10/10\nJust look at my hours on this VN…It costs £30 and you can probably get it on sale for around £20 or less if you’re lucky. This is totally worth it, no doubts about that one. Took me 61 hours to finish ONE ROUTE, yes ONE ROUTE!! That should tell you a lot. So, if you are planning to finish all the routes, you’ll definitely get your money’s worth here. This is a must buy for the person out there willing to spend the time on reading all the chapters and finishing all the routes.\n\nEnd of Review","January 29","true","61.2"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","24","32","0","0"

Already having completed this game pre-Steam release, this is probably the visual novel I'd recommend to anyone looking for a (long) ride to enjoy. Oh, and yes, everything except for the main character is voiced. And done beautifully, at that.\n\nIn the story you take the role as the main character, Kazami Yuuji. He's a cool guy, always knows what to do and seems to be experienced in most things in life already. Currently attending this school while having a chain tied to his neck from the government. So what's up with this guy? After a bit of trouble in the start you make your way to the academy where you will be staying with 5 other girls, each with their unique traits: A maid, a ♥♥♥♥, a loli, a tsundere and an anti-social crazy boxcutter girl. All of these girls are in this academy because of the same reason as you - there's something in their past that makes them ♥♥♥♥ed up. After an entertaining common route, you get to delve deep into one of the girls backstory. They are drama-filled, funny and contain action as well. And some romance. And porn (well, not here unfortunately). Even if you are not a very emotional person, I can almost assure you it will bring a tear to your eye or at least make your heart sink. Unfortunately I believe Sekai took out the H-scenes from this release, which were amazingly well done. Anyway little by little you'll see Yuuji's backstory unfold, and by the end you'll want more. That's where the sequel game swoops in and serves you the full story, before the third game takes you back to the present with some mindblowing action and excitement.\n\nThe OST of this visual novel is absolutely fantastic. The songs playing throughout the game helps set a good mood, and the ending songs can be very heartbreaking. One thing to notice that might be different from many other visual novels is the lack of choices here. You don't get awfully many. You will play many hours without seeing a choice. There are some, though. However this is not necessarily a bad thing. This visual novel wants to tell you a great story, however your ability to influence it is limited. You will influence it, and the outcome of it, but not as much as many people would probably wish for. Furthermore due to the different personality of the girls, you're guaranteed to find one you like. Whether it's one of the academy girls, JB, Asako, Kazuki or even the principal.\n\nPros\n- Engaging and rich story\n- Funny -  I tried to capture images of many of the funny scenes but there were too many and it was pointless cause at that point I'd just reveal the entire game to whoever I showed it so they might as well just play it themselves. Yes, it's that much.\n- The humor is amazingly well tied together\n- Sachi\n- 5 routes in addition to the common route, where each route is 100% unique (no events going twice)\n- MC is NOT a dense ♥♥♥♥\n- Beautiful OST\n- Good art\n- Lots of on-screen effects (both visual and sounds) to enhance reading experience\n- hot grils\n\n\nCons\n-\n\nThings to keep in mind\n- The game is ♥♥♥♥ING long. Whether this is a good or a bad thing is up to you. Considering how much I enjoyed the game, this is definitely good for me. I have, however, recommended this game to a lot of people that don't want to give it a go because it packs probably 80+ hours of gameplay (all routes) if you do not try to speed-read through it. Most of these people say they'd rather watch the 13-episode anime. Yeah, 13 episodes, it's pretty much bound to be a failure trying to fit all this gameplay into 13 episodes.\n\nNow as I haven't played through this translation of the game yet, I can't comment on the translation. I will eventually though, I guess. Hopefully they kept the translation notes up top that explained "Japanese in-side jokes" and some events that we should know about to have things make sense (there was something about WW2 for example). That ♥♥♥♥  was dope.\n\nSince the sequel novels aren't fan translated I have no choice but to wait for Sekai to translate them as well, so I'll be eagerly waiting for that. Meanwhile I'll probably replay this game just because I've forgotten a lot of the details due to it being massive. The game has a lot of common sense tips "and tricks" etc that they drop throughout which are worth picking up in life.\n\nAll in all I really recommend this visual novel and it's my #1, not having heard anyone have a single negative experience with it yet. The only issue for some people is the length, however if you can overcome it at first, you'll be glad that there's so much content when you're halfway. Also bear in mind that this length is all the routes. You can probably do the common route + 1 girl in 40~ hours.","May 30, 2015","true","235.6"," 32 of 48 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","32","48","4","0"

Memorable soundtrack that fits the atmosphere. The steam version lacks the H-scenes but they were few and far between and the VN never relied on them to be awesome which makes the steam version alright.\nContent-wise, you can easilly get around 40-50 hours of gameplay by going through each of the 5 routes. The story is divided into the common route which will then either split into one girl's route or continue, then repeat until you are forced into the last girl's route. You get around 20 hours of common route to learn about the characters. As mentioned earlier, the most important part in games like these are making the reader care about the characters and they Frontwing totally nailed it.

Over 40hours without repeating any content.  Each storyline is unique and some of them will likely mess with your emotions.  Some are laughable and absurd, others are almost painful.  Each storyline felt worth my time.  I think the main thing to take away like the many short and cheap visual novels available this is a very long one.  You can get to each ending only making 3-5 choices, so it is pretty much just reading.  But the story is quite worthy.\n\nThis is not a visual novel to get just to try to rush to “money shots” (which steam doesn’t include).  “Claiming” a girl probably happens the earliest about 15 hours into the game and isn’t something the story focuses around.   All the characters are “almost normal,” which means relationship development occurs mostly naturally within each storyline.  The male main character isn’t a virgin or sex crazed manic, so the game doesn’t let you treat the girls as if you were.\n","April 25","true","56.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

This is an update after having finished the entire game. All five paths, all ten endings.\nHaving done that, I've gotta say. Holy ♥♥♥♥, that was an incredible experience. Maybe, my expectations (tempered by the likes of Sakura Swim Club...ugh) had an effect on this, but... I literally ended up dropping everything else I was playing on PC at the time just to consume more of these narratives. I know that the localization of The Labyrinth of Grisaia is in progress and I'm very much excited for when it will come out.\n\nPros:\n-Since this is a VN, let's get the most important bit out of the way first. The writing in this game, while it takes it a bit to get started, is absolutely PHENOMENAL. Each of the character arcs is handled incredibly well. Each of the five characters are thought through and are very interesting character studies. Not to mention, the way the character personalities clash is often hilarious. It's to the extent that I've found myself contemplating some plot points or speculating about possible upcoming events while at work or on my commute.\n-On the note of writing, I've gotta give major props to the writers that handled the translation. The amount of vocabulary that I've learned from this game exceeds most natively english titles. There were even times when I saw a word, thought it was a typo, looked it up, and learned that it was an actual word. Well done.\n-This game doesn't fall into the pit trap of having copy/pasted narratives. Yes, there's some similar themes that happen on occasion, but I was pleased to see that each of the paths is basically unique and even each of the endings is distinctly different.\n-The voice actors have done an excellent job. While I, no longer, speak Japanese, but the emotion, intonation, and delivery have left me often just letting the VA finish the particular line before advancing to the next bit....and, that doesn't happen often, as I'm usually speeding through dialogue, not bothering to wait on the VA.\n-The music, while I feel that some of the loops could have been handled a bit better, otherwise, I have no complaints. Each individual track is fantastic, been pleasant enough to listen to, and I don't recall any of them having become grating, even after a multitude of repetitions.\n-The art in the game is superb. I won't even deny that a handful of scenes have made their way into my wallpapers collection.\n-Unexpectedly enough, there's also quite the collection of bonus material. I know that VNs commonly include their art and a few other things with them, but this is even more generous.\n\nA couple of other comments, though they are not exactly cons:\n-The way each of the routes is set up, once you branch off, what happened in the other route no longer exists. As a result of that, there were points where I couldn't help but feel a bit guilty choosing one option, knowing that I've avandoned the fate of a character in favor of another. That being said, I believe that this VN's character progressions would have suffered quite a bit if it was a "help everyone" type of story, so I'm not really complaining. Hell, it's not often that a narrative has left me to care this much for a character.\n-I've gotta mention the censorship. I've gotta give credit to Frontwing to having included additional content in the M-rated version to make up for the cut scenes, but... It does (apparently) have an effect on one of the character arcs and it's the matter of personal principle to note this. I suppose, at least, that's easily enough remedied if you desire to do so.\n\nTL;DR: All in all, though, it's been a marvelous and enjoyable experience (to the point of considering this to be the best VN I've consumed to date). I know that the $40 pricetag may seen intimidating, but if it'll help, I'll say this much. The first story arc I complete was Sachi's. In my opinion, even if the game had ended with just that, I'd still consider this to have been money well spent. I'm very much excited for the sequel to be released.","January 10","true","96.3"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

But I really enjoyed getting to know the quirky characters and the humor in this part of the story was a joy to read through, it also helped that many of the illustrations in this part of the game were in the adorable and amusing "chibi style" which helped a lot with letting the reader actually see what the insane jokes and misunderstandings actually looked like and how each individual character reacted to them.\n\nThe music is also great. It's dramatic where it needs to be, sad where it needs to be and funny where it needs to be. It's not on the level of say, Jun Maeda's music in the Key VNs but it is still a wonderful soundtrack.\n\nLastly, the choices are pretty clear and to the point. In some VNs it can be difficult to see where your choices will lead the story, but in Fruit of Grisaia it's very obvious and seeing that was a pleasant surprise for me.\n\nAll in all I fullheartedly think this is worth the price tag, it's a great visual novel and I'd recommend it both to lovers of the genre and those who are simply curious about VNs.\nI absolutely loved Fruit, and honestly hope Labyrinth and Eden will continue the trend set by this game.","May 24","true","83.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There is NO NUDITY unless you get some fan patch which adds the scenes, that being said its fine without it, "that" topic is suggested and you will know when its happened. the language isnt censored so its quite realistic in that sense.\n\nThis game is different to your standard VNs because firstly its extremely long, 29hours in and ive not finished even one of the five routes. Afterthat its got massive amounts of character building and best of all the protagonist has a personality and his own motivations, hes the kind of character that you would remember because he is on par with the other people in the game.\n\nOnce you get into the seperate routes you will notice that this isnt you standard "everything is happy" scenario, these six people have gone through extremely hard upbringing hence them being alone in this education facility. Those paths will slowly unveil themselves as you choose your various routes, it is possible to fail, it is possible to stay neutral or die or get someone killed.

Fruit of Grisaia has sparked an obsession within me for its sequels in particular and other Visual Novels in general.\n\nEven if you are not familar with the concept of visual novel and only watch anime or reading manga before, I'm sure you still going to love this game, since this is also the first visual novel I've ever play as well. The immersion level that you get when playing a visual novel game has no equal, it let your imagination go as far as you want, and you can decide the final conlusion by making the right choices through out the game. That is to say, the game has multiply routes for you to choose. Each and everytime I finished an ending, I was mind blowed by the godlike character cast, excellent production value, great comedy and extreme lewdness (only with the Unrated Patch, Steam edition was censored). There is an abnormal amount of psychological depth and serious storylines, which is amazing for such a game often overlooked as "purely harem and fanservice". I was even more surpirsed that they can manage to do all those things repeatedly 5 times in a row, through out 5 endings for each girls in the school.\n\n10/10 Would buy full price. Can't wait for the sequels.\n\nP/S: Fruit of Grisaia already got an anime adaptation, with 2 TV series and one special episode, but I would dare say don't even bother watching it.

I would find it very hard to justify when for example I got it on a 50% sale.\n\nMy Thoughts:I personally loved this game from every point. This game will drive you down every road for each character which I felt was very effective at truly making you decide who you love and want to go for. This game has five main characters excluding the player, however there are ten endings. Each character has one good ending and one bad ending which really gives the game some replay value. Each character has a very interesting unique personality from each other.\nOne of the key things I found very interesting about this game was the developer’s decision to make scenes focus on all the girls just talking about a random topic. For example, which room they should have dinner in or what they should call each other even though the player isn’t talking in those scenes but rather sitting aside. I felt this gave very true character development.\nWhat could have been better:The story is very long. In fact, probably the longest visual novel I’ve ever read. However, it contains the same amount of player choices as for example a six-hour visual novel would have. Because of this, I felt there was huge gaps in between the player choices which lead to me feeling as if it was linear. Personally, I like the ability to decide my own future within the story to a relatively advance degree saying that the retail price is exceptionally high compared to other visual novels.\nWould I recommend:YES! By far this is my favorite visual novel. However, if you intend to get this game please don’t pay full retail. It’s not even remotely justifiable. But with that said everything is amazing from the unique characters to the way they’re represented within the visual novel.\n","June 2","true","276.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The characterization is incredibly deep... Just... wow.\n\nA lot of people complain about the lack of H scenes compared to the unrated version, but I think it stands just fine on its own.

Yes, steam sells all-age version, which cuts few adult scenes out of it, but considering sheer amount of reading material, its just tiny part. Anyway if that bothers you there is comunity guide describing how to "restore" it to full version. So there is no point complaining about that.\n\nStorywise game starts in light tone describing "adventures" of Kazami Yuuji in his new school. There is lot of laughs to be had and its quite enjoyable read. But as soon as you chose which "route" you want go (which girl you want to romance), story gets mutch more serious, because each girl have tragical past and serious problems to overcome. That said, game can be pretty sad and some of the endings might considered good endings but definitely not "happy" endings.\n\nOnce you chose route rest of story is totaly different from other routes No filler is being shared betwen story lines. That means aproximetly 15 hours of reading material for each girl (and i dont consider myself slow reader :) ).\n\nI am not expert on VNs, but i consider writing in this to be pretty good. Each girl's story is pretty strong and left lasting impresion on me (that kind where you fail to fall asleep, because you keep replaying over some of the dramatic scenes in your mind). But its not all tragic, this game have lots of humor as well, some scenes are so funny, they left me laughing for minutes, before i was able to resume reading ... specialy Sachi's lines in Makina route are just totaly awesome!\n\nBoth character and background art is well done, but i would appreciate more animation to the sprites. Blinking and mouth sync would be nice.\n\nVoice acting is in japonese so i dont understand a ♥♥♥♥, but i think it conveys emotions quite well. Just listening to Amane talking puts me at ease and paints smile on my face :)\n\n\nOverall, i like this "game" a lot. I never expected myself to spend over 100 hours on visual novel so this one took me by suprise and i would like to recomend it to anyone who is looking for good story.","January 31","true","133.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Period.\n\n- Beginning of the visual novel was a bit slow, I'd say filler combined with character development. Takes until a few hours until you actually start one of the girl's routes\n- Lack of choices, either way you're gonna end up in a bad or good route\n- Amount of save files you have\n- Despite great voice acting, some voices can be a tad bit annoying to listen to Ex) Michiru's/Makina's yelling\n- Has no true ending as you have to choose one girl to stick with\n- Auto button doesn't properly function\n- Screenshotting was a bit clunky\n\nOverall, this visual novel lives up to its name as one of the most highly rated visual novels out there, only containing minor negatives. However, I would buy this game off from Denpasoft's website if you want the best experience of playing this game as the steam version of this game leaves out many things. A definite must buy if you are a fan of long intriguing visual novels.","November 28, 2015","true","412.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

This novel had me laughing, tense, and crying all through, this is in my opinion one of the greatest purchases i have ever made, ive only done the Amane ending and to be honest that was the ending i was eyeing for when i started reading and heard that there were multiple endings for each girl. My heart is rarely ever touched and shedding tears does not come easy for me but this novel really grabbed me. After reading i felt like it had changed me in the end, i felt the need to re-invent myself and find my own way and never give up, during reading i noticed that me and yuuji were the same though our circumstances were different, i sat here with a life with a unclear purpose and desired something to protect as well as yuuji, and after reading this novel it awoken something inside me and ill never forget this experience. im writing all this deep thoughts more for me than really for a review, and i know that i cant give up and ill find my prupose somewhere as yuuji did.\n\nPROS:\nthe novel presents several choices (not much at all), took me 15 hours of reading to find the first one, these choices, though may seem unnessecary at first actually lead you down the ending for 1 of the 5 girls, going on my instincts my choices led me to the amane ending and i dont regret my choices in the slightest, in fact im damn proud of it.\n\nCONS:\ni dont have much in terms of cons that arent biased, for example when i was doing the amane route and i had to read the long diary that took me a good 8 hours to get through and the ending of the diary was already know before you even started so i was generally uninterested in the whole thing and got pretty tired of reading it.\n\nSUMMARY:\nthis novel is absolutly beautiful and i encourage others who are fans of anime related novels, romance novels, and gut twister novels, to give this one a look, espically if youre someone like me who have a strong sense to protect people you care about or purpose seekers, you will NOT regret reading this, i promise you, and if you thought otherwise you have the freedom to message me on here and slap this review back in my face, but i absolutly stand by on what i just typed down.","July 19, 2015","true","48.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I love the series.\n2. To support the people that made it.\n3. To write a review telling you that you should buy it too.\n\nI've read this VN once before with the unofficial translation, and absolutely fell in love with it to the point where I wanted to do whatever I could to support it when available. I ended up purchasing a Japanese psp version of the game, and now this one, and I plan to buy it again when DenpaSoft releases the unrated version(oh boy, h scenes!!). This VN stands as one of my favorite VNs and stories overall, only beaten out by Muv Luv Alternative.\n\nThe characters in this story are all really well done. They are extremely enjoyable, and if you don't like one of the characters, you're bound to like another.\nYuuji is a fantastic protagonist, who manages to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and a sweetheart all at the same time, in some manner.\nAmane is the onee-san type role, and absolutely fantastic. Her route has a bit of a boring spot but quickly picks up and is one of my favorites in the game.\nMichiru wants to be your run of the mill tsundere but manages to be a very interesting character.\nSachi is a maid who does what everyone says.\nMakina's the loli/imouto type, and I'm not too interested in her but her route is fantastic, probably the best in the game.\nAnd Yumiko is your violent kuudere, similar to Senjougahara from the monogatari series.\nThere is a lot more to each character, and a reason they act the way they do, but if I were to say more I'd spoil all the fun.\n\nThe story is absolutely fantastic, but if I were to go on about it, I'd probably end up spoiling it for you so I don't want to say anything, but there's plenty of good twists and events within the VN to really keep you interested.\n\nThere isn't a whole lot of choices to make in this vn. A few filler choices in shared route, and then 2 choices per route(One to get on each route, and one to decide the ending).\n\nThe one thing to keep in mind when reading this vn, is that it is extremely long(VNDB states about 50+ hours). The shared route goes on for quite some time.\n\nThis VN is definitely worth the cost, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys VNs, or anime.\nIf you watched the Grisaia anime, the VN is a must, as the anime doesn't nearly compare to how good the VN is.\n\nAs I said earlier, if you'd rather wait for an uncensored version with more anime boob, DenpaSoft is also going to be releasing one at a later currently unannounced date.","June 1, 2015","true","0.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/legend_jony/recommended/345610/","legend_jony","Zero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/legend_jony/","648 products in account","The Fruit Of Grisaia is a really long visual novel with 5 different routes with 1 common route\nwith 10 different ending ( 5 good ending and 5 bad ending ).\n\nThe Story : as always visual novels tends to have a great storyline ( unless its a fanservice game... ).\nThe fruit of grisaia is one of those visual novels with a great amout of detail to the story, the story follows one protagonist  his name is Kazami Yuuji, in which you pick a route ( in other words a girl from the 5 optional ) to follow her story and tragic past that might sometimes have connection to the player ( it can be related to the past of the protagonist or being related to his "job" ). In the end you must together with main heroine ( of your choosing ) overcome the hardships of traumatic pasts and find a solution.\nAll I can say that every route has a very detailed story and can be very emotional ( depends on which type of peson you are ). All of the characters are well developed and you will come to care for all of them ( of course there will be one special character which will be your favorite in which I would suggest to do her route last ).\n\nGameplay : Mostly you are gonna read... alot, no joke here I spent 100+ hours on reading every route and every ending ( of course I did a mistake with the common route so the time to actually be needed to read will be for 70+ ).\nThere will be only 5 choices in every route ( actually 3 of them are common route the other 2 are in which you chose a girl and which ending you will get ). So in other words only those who love visual novels will enjoy this.\n\nSound : Amazing simply amazing. from the voice acting to the soundtracks and even to the sound effects everything was simply perfect, indeed added the right atmosphere from funny,happy,amusing,sad,anger,horror everything was simply perfect in that retrospect.\n\nBugs : none to be had... seriously its hard to do those in those kind of games\n\nGraphics : Those who like anime style will like the graphics here even though its just a couple of pictures and maybe a few animations.\n\nSummary : This game is simply like a book, amazing characters, great atmosphere, brilliant storytelling, and of course a great deal of time will be spent so its well worth the money.\nI can't spoil to much if you want to enjoy so I can't add to much detail to the plot ( and since the game is all about the plot I can't add anymore information ). But I will suggest to all of you do to the following routes in this order :\nMichiru > Yumiko > Sachi > Makina > Amane ( this is how I did the routes ) of course as I wrote before I would suggest to do your favorite girl as the last route ( and since Amane was mine favorite I did her route last )\nOverall I'll give this game a 9\10 ( Only because I didn't cried from every route )","September 28, 2015","true","115.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IcyDyman/recommended/345610/","IcyDyman","Icy Prinny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IcyDyman/","159 products in account","Just got done with the VN, and honestly? Very much worth it at full price, although I'd still say try and snag it when it's on sale - as I think the 18+ version denpasoft might be better, as it keeps the full story intact from what I'm told. (( Even if they mostly just took out the sex scenes; still never a fan of a good read being messed with. ))\n\n\n+ Pros +\n\n- Very long read ( Clocked in nearly sixty hours total. Fifty or slightly less if you're a very fast reader or skim some of the basic parts of the VN. )\n- Each girl has a great story to tell.\n- Main Character is great as well, with a story you'll want to know more of as time goes on.\n- Great soundtrack\n- A GREAT deal of voice acting. (( Granted it's in Japanese ))\n- You'll come to care for each girl over time, along with caring for the MC, Yuuji. (( Holy ♥♥♥♥, his way of thinking cracks me up at times. ))\n- Each route has two different endings, offering around ten endings or so.\n- A emotional roller coaster, that will make you laugh, smile, sad, and even at times feel tense.\n- Many of the cliches you'd come to expect in 'anime like' settings are not present. Such as how the MC reacts to the girls and how they at times react to him.\n- After reading each route, get nifty stuff to download; voice clips, wallpaper, icons, and some nice pictures!\n\n\n-- Cons --\n\n-  Very little in terms of choice picking; you have about two or less per route. About a dozen or less choices if I recall correctly.\n- One of the endings feels. . ."ill-fitting" compared to the rest, but still good. Take it with an open mind.\n- Opening Video somewhat spoils key points, if you pay close attention or keep rewatching it.\n- No english voice acting, it's only in Japanese. (( May not be a con for some, but do wish there was more, as I feel the voice acting would connect with me more, if it was in english. ))\n- Due to this being the All-Age version, several scenes were taken out. Mostly the sex scenes, along with some parts of the game being 'toned down' just a bit, due to being consider 'too mature'. Shouldn't effect the reading, but I still greatly dislike something being messed with. (( Sometimes you might even miss the fact they had sex, which for one or two scenes can change your view on what's going on. ))\n\n\n+- Other Notes -+\n\n- The steam version, while not 18+, does offer a number of artwork not in the first version of the VN.\n- Being in fullscreen and trying to Shift + Tab on steam wasn't a wise idea, as it seems the VN struggles to work with steam on that aspect. Nothing too bad, but somewhat buggy to deal with. May just be me.\n- I'd highly suggest reading the story in a certain manner, via playing through the list below, as it feels the best reading wise, along with not effecting your view points of the others if read in another manner;\n\n* Michiru > Yumiko > Sachi > Amane > Makina\n\nNOTE: You can still do the routes in any order you wish, and it may not effect you much if you decide to choose. . .Amane first, or Michiru last. This is just my view and how I read through it, when suggested by another. The pacing felt right, and by doing this you also slowly learn more about a certain character; in a way that feels well paced and enjoyable.\n\n\nIn the end? Yes, I'd say get this VN ASAP if you're looking for a damn good read. Although I'd say get the steam version only if it's on sale, while getting the full version on denpasoft's website. Although the steam version keeps the story well intact, again mostly messes with the Sex scenes.","September 7, 2015","true","58.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Each one of the routes had its own individual qualities that made me really enjoy it. When I first considered buying this game, I was hesitant, because of the $40 price, so I waited until it was on sale to buy it. However, the game took 90 hours for me to complete, so I would definitely recommend buying games that are as long as The Fruit of Grisaia both at a sale discount and at full price.\n\nThe Steam version of the game is the more tame, non-sexual version of the game, so I wouldn't recommend the Steam version of this game if you are looking for boobs. The introduction part of this game, before the player starts making choices in the game, seemed to last a bit longer than it should've, and was a bit boring.

But as the player, you are given the choice to involve yourself with any one of the other students--at which points their secrets unfold in front of Yuuji's eyes, some of Yuuji's own past is revealed, and the game steadily takes a turn for the dramatic (and at times, tragic).  By playing through all of the endings, the player reveals a good portion of Yuuji's own tragic past as well.\n\nIt's a clever story, with fascinating characters, a wicked sense of humor... and ultimately, a satisfying conclusion (if the player makes the appropriate choices, that is).  I highly recommend this to anyone who likes visual novels.","May 31, 2015","true","14.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Just like another typical e̶r̶o̶g̶e̶ visual novel which we go over a heroine route and another.\nFor you who have already watched the anime, you'll know that every heroine have a tragic background and later will be "saved" by the main protagonist, Yuuji. But please note, watched the anime is the same with playing the VN in skip mode. which is you'll be missed the emotion of the story.\n\nCommon route have a very refreshing "unusual" school-life-themed story. A bit long but truly enjoyable. The character development is really good eventhough some part is really boring.\n\nHeroine route will tell you the tragic background of girl's route you take which is totally different with most VN i've played. (Eventho it's still not better than G-senjou no maou imho)\nYou can really feel the emotion which is delivered perfectly. And it's totally reccomended to play all route in order to fully enjoyed the rest of the series.\n\nDespite there's cut for the H scene, for me the H scene in kajitsu is nothing but fanservice. Except for Amane's part which  is have a deep emotional talk during it.\n\nLast, kindly reminder from me that Ama-nee is the best gurl.","May 31, 2015","true","7.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xGaudion/recommended/345610/","xGaudion","Gaudion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xGaudion/","508 products in account","As much as I'd love to gush on this; I would like to simply keep this review short.\n\nThis review is being conducted under the fact that I played the Visual Novel first and then watched the relevant anime short after.\n\nThe first thing I'd like to state first is that this visual novel is very well done, so don't fret on that fact.\nThe story simply begins with you as Yuuji Kazumi, a student who transfers to a school with a past shrouded in mystery, in where you meet five students; Amane Suou, Yumiko Sakaki, Makina Irisu, Michuru Matsushima and Sachi Komine.\n\nThe general setting is somewhat to a Harem-esque formula, but it's portrayed in a fantasy, loosely convincing manner with each of the girls considering him as an interest for reasons that revolve around the reasons of why they're even at Mihama Academy in the first place- wait, did I forget to mention that they're all in a specially private school? Well yeah, they are.\n\nI'm not going to give away any details according to the game itself; but believe me with the hours that I poured into this game- no, this interactive book, that it is indeed worth a read through for something compelling, dark and genuinely intriguing in the setting its constructed upon.\n\nIf you're an honest to god cynic who has seen all there's to be seen with this sort of setting; then I'd suggest going towards this story if you want to experience a story with a decent psychological grab and possibly nothing more.\n\nBecause of the circumstances towards this kind of game and review; I'm also going to give a comparison review of the anime itself.\n\nThe anime in a short and concise summary; is that between the two, it is indeed a great deal the same as the Visual Novel in question, but I will say for the first time in my life that "the book is indeed better than the movie", despite the relevancy of chronological order. It follows the same events as the visual novel except for the fact that everyone's path minus Amane's is more or less condensed from what was for me a fair amount of hours of a decent read is turned into maybe 10-15 minutes of animation and by itself, it's really nothing too interesting by itself.\n\nNevertheless, I'll say that Fruit of Grisaia as a Visual Novel blew me out of the water with expectations; It was an engaging story and I actually was able to connect towards each and every character involved in different ways.\n\nNow I'd like to give a more personal, yet introspective paragraph or so on the characters themselves and how I felt going through their story with some humor inserted at the end.\n\nMy order of play went with the following: Amane, Sachi, Michuru, Makina and then Yumiko; with that I will say that I am extremely pleased I went with the order given.\n\nAmane:\nHer story is evidently the main plot in question as it is given the most content as well as the most atmosphere; as the character she was before and after, I would say that she is a fair bit of a case of "Perfect Girl for Audience" as she's well characterized sexually and I suppose in personality for the type of person who just wants a "No Trouble" kind of girl; but it is thankfully redeemed with the essence of her story in relation to the character. She ends on a note that I obviously cannot spoil for those reading this review, but be assured that it is definitely not what you would expect.\n\nAmane: 3/5, Amane's ♥♥♥♥: 7.5/10\n\nConclusion: Amane is an adorable character within her own rights with a bit of a flirty side that can at times get a little cringeworthy depending on how self-aware you are as an individual; her cameos within the other stories ring this to be especially true. I would easily place Amane in my Top 3 of the story.\n\nSachi:\nSachi, Sachi; where do we begin with this girl? She's a porcelian doll with a personality that only a retail manager could have a wet dream of, she's extremely obedient and reliable in more extreme ways that anyone would humanely conceive. Her past as the rest of the girls has a fair bit of a dark, yet sad nature to it and reflects completely throughout the story itself. I honestly pitied this girl with a lot of relatable reasons in comparison to previously mentioned Amane.\n\nSachi: 4/5, Sachi without Maid Outfit: Nose Bleed/5\n\nConclusion: Sachi perhaps could be an allegory for the truest of working class people; which made it really easy to relate to her as a good hearted individual and her past is even more capable of hitting to home for plenty of people and as you are to progress her story, you'll learn why.\n\nMichuru:\nAt this point; I'd ask anyone reading to give themselves a pat on the back for reading through this all thus far and maybe go to the bathroom with a drink at the ready for when they return, however I digress; let's begin with Michuru...\n\nThis "bottle-blonde" is a live wire who truly does live to the stereotype of a "typical blonde". Michuru in one phrase is a loveable idiot. Her hobbies within the story include: Ordering everyone, especially Sachi around to do things for her, acting like a "tsundere" (my research seems to conclude that it is indeed not an extreme form of tsunami, but for a lack of better phrasing a "Batshit insane woman".) and eating ramune candy. She comes off rather childish but seems to have a rare capacity for the occasional piece of advice, insight or even helping someone in a nice way without realizing it; that however doesn't mean she's incapable of being kind, she's simply not a considerate person entirely by nature. Perhaps with progress and time, you'll find out there's more than meets the eye?\n\nMichuru: 2/5, Michuru After Story: 3/5\n\nConclusion: Simple fact is that she does have a fairly good story for herself and it perfectly suits her for the archetype of character she is; however she really didn't appeal to me other than the fact I could feel pity for her while she was in her lowest of spirits, my personal opinion is that don't disregard her, but also don't be Too surprised.\n\nMakina:\nOh my god, how could you not love this character? She simply has everything that appeals to your sympathy.\nMakina is basically the Curly of this batch of "stooges" in this game's cast of characters; extremely impressionable and leaving of impressions, she has no true rival in her caliber and simply has everyone around her with her adorable sense of idiocy in the palm of her hands, with the "drawback"(?) of lacking any common relating sexual appeal (Unless you're into girls who look like they're about ten to eleven years old, in which case; I won't judge directly or even comment further). I truly want to say more about her, but I can't without divulging too heavily; just don't cry when the story progresses on if you can avoid it.\n\nMakina: 4/5, Makina /w Double Melon Bun: 55/5, would let sit on my lap and cuddle like a puppy.\n\nConclusion:\nShe's simply a fun and interesting character; full of spirit and easily a creative type. It truly is hard to talk in depth about this character with the goal in mind of not giving massive story spoilers, so just take my word for it; she's a goof and easily one of my favorites. Easily a contender for first place as "Character who I would be Best Friends with" and pretty close for number one overall, but that's up for debate on another day.\n\n\nFinally, we meet the last of the girls who I had played within the last final hours of my intense playthrough: Yumiko...\n\nWhich I'll continue the review on a comment within the review; apologies as I've got quite the case of writing diarrhea.\n(The general idea is Yes, buy this game if you want a visual novel worth your time as a reader)","December 10, 2015","true","99.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

After hearing that is was given the "Green Light" on steam i decided to buy and give it a go and also support the  Sekai project in their efforts to making the other sequals as well. What surprises me is that there is a slight difference in the games so far, nothing to claim it a horrible remake but enough for me to realize the difference. It could be that the english patch was just a fan made version (totally plausible) or they decided to spruce it up in this remake but i digress.\n\nI completed the non steam version 100% and i have to say that this is one of the best visual novels out there. The story at first seems nice and the charecters are cool but it the further you delve into the game the more story you get. Each of the girl charecters is unique with a brilliant back story that turns into a magnificent work of art and each story you complete the more is revealed on the protaganists story. While this game is beautiful it also is able to realy pull on your heart strings if you give into the game. If you have watched the anime and then play this game you will realize how much has been stripped from the anime so that they could air it in just one season. Also, if you try and base the routes off of what was on the anime you will probably have a rough time. Im not 100% sure if the earlier on choices have much of an impact to the game in the long run but deffinently give it an intresting change for the moment. While the steam page claims it takes 50-80 hours to complete it actually is a lot longer because those 50-80 hours are for one route and there are a total of five routes. Speaking of which, if you happen to get the good ending the first time dont be affraid to go back and choose the bad ending. They generally have quite the spin of events on the story. Overall, this game is amazing and if you have 40 bucks (or less, you know the sales steam have) this is anything but a waste of time.

This Steam version is edited so as many of sexual scenes have been redone as romance scenes. Nudity has also been edited, unlike the original so it's safer for more sensitive audiences.\nAs one who played the original, I was somewhat disappointed with these changes as every scene flowed so smoothly and added to the brighter side of the stories for each character. That said, if you are unsure if visual novels are your flavor; this paticular one would prove the better of choices as it can be quite the immersive and entertaining experience.","June 15, 2015","true","115.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yet I was pleasantly surprised by how much more there was to the story than what I had known. The big build up at the start of getting used to being in an academy felt happily real, and each of the endings afterwards was rewarding enough to make all that reading more than worth it! As I write this, I have just finished Amane's route, and it was such a thoroughly fulfilling ending that I sat around for a good while afterwards wondering what there was to do with my life any more. I read through some reviews and was advised to play through this route last, and I completely agree and reemphasise the necessity of saving this one til the end. After finishing it, it probably wouldn't feel quite right to then jump back in and take on someone else's story.\nDespite all the psychological trauma this game will likely inflict on you, I thoroughly and wholeheartedly recommend it.

Onto actually reviewing the game. Grisaia on a whole is a very good VN. The writing for the characters is really good and makes you feel for the characters, the 50 hour common route only helps that. The art is top-notch and beatiful to look at. I really liked the comedy and it made me laugh multiple times, though people's sense of humor aren't the same so keep that in mind. The soundtrack is also really good, and pretty much each of the tracks set the atmosphere properly and are easy to remember.","June 18, 2015","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Grisaia no Kajitsu is painfully average in many regards. Let the fanboys pour their hate upon me, yet I shall still hold my position. The game suffers from some of the worst pacing I have ever experienced, only being topped by that of Hoshizora no Memoria. Ive tried to like this, as can be shown by my playtime. I was almost never idle when I was playing. Yet, I feel disappointed. About 70% of the entire game is filler. It is full of bland and boring dialogue,  with uninventive slice of life scenes. So far, i've only completed 2 routes, and i'm on my 3rd. Yet I have continuously found it difficult to keep forcing myself through the dull happenings that constantly plague the story just to get to the meat of the game.\n\nIve heard many people praise the game for exploring the backgrounds and psyches of the characters, and it does live up to that expectation. However, you have to get through 40 hours of sleep-inducing dialogue and repetitive events. Its simply not worth it unless you have a ♥♥♥♥ ton of patience. Granted, even that probably wont be enough. Ive played around 20 visual novels, 7 of which take around 20-50 hours to complete. However, those visual novels contained something this one does not. An interesting plot. The plot is entirely non-existent, only focusing on character exploration of each heroine. The common route is merely 30 hours of filler. Its absolutely mind numbingly boring.\n\nAll in all, this game was a disappointment to me. I picked it up on its release date when it was being hyped up by a ♥♥♥♥ ton of people. If theres anything I can thank this visual novel for, its getting me into the meat of the genre. However, I can not recommend this. Buy this if you are looking for a game ENTIRELY character-driven, as that is all you will get. If you are trying to find a thought-provoking or engaging story, I would recommend G Senjou no Maou.\n\nEdit 1: The heroine routes are pretty good, I will admit. The flashback scenes hold quite a bit of tension during them, and keeps you hooked the entire time (unlike the rest of the game). Even so, I don't think it's worth it to have to go through the utterly mediocre and bland common route. Many people say that the reason that Grisaia is so great is because of its comedy and its characters. While its characters are where it shines, and they are quite complex, that is simply no excuse for the lack of plot focus in the game. It feels like the writer should have spent more time focusing on creating a compelling story rather than dragging the game out with filler.\n\nSome of the scenes tugged at my heartstrings, but they left no lasting impression. In regards to the comedy, it might just not be for me. I honestly tried to enjoy the slice of life elements, but they just aren't that great. The comedy falls flat, and just doesn't compare to legitimately funny and gripping VNs like Majikoi Oh Samurai Girls. I will admit that I am judging this game harshly, but I truly did enjoy many parts of it. I do think this is one of the best VNs on steam, but I can't wholeheartedly recommend it with its flaws. Hence why I made a negative review instead of a positive review.\n\nEdit 2: Alright, so I have currently finished Sakaki's route, and am now on Makina's. While I felt that Amane and Michiru's routes were quite dull, I found Sakaki's route to be much better. It started out very dull and boring, but ended up being quite good in the end. I don't wish to spoil it, but I honestly preferred it much more over Amane and Michiru's routes. Makina's route so far is quite cute in all honesty, and I think that she might be my favorite out of all of them. Also, it seems like the majority of Yuuji's (Protagonist) backstory is revealed in this route, making it much more interesting. I'm still not going to give this game a positive review as I feel that more people would see this if it was in the negative reviews rather than positive, and I have not seen any other reviews shed light on the game's issues.\n\nI would recommend this game hesitantly ONLY to someone looking for slice of life with a bit of tragedy mixed in (definitely don't look for a compelling overall story, as that is not what you will get).","February 13","false","93.1"," 16 of 34 people (47%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","47","16","34","5","0"

Kazami quickly learns that he is the sixth student to have started to attend a school and that his other classmates are all of the opposite gender.\n\nYuuji's classmates consist of a cute little ball of energy named Makina Irisu, who has a noticable lisp in her voice when she speaks do to having a very small tongue. Makina is usually intimidated by people she just meant and usually hids behind her bestfriend/older sister figure Amane Suou.\n\nUpon opening up to someone, Makina shows her more troublemaking side and loves to use the fact that she is small and adorable to get her way with just about anyone who she is comfortable with.\n\nMakina's tramatic past has to deal with her rich family background that is just as amazingly well-written as it is sad. A mother who has abandoned her and screws around with other men.\n\nYuuji's next classmate is a fake-tsundere by the name of Michiru Matsushima. Michiru has conciously decided to act as the token tsundere archtype, although it is pretty easily to tell that it is forced. Michiru tries to empress others with her tsundere act, although most of the time she fails horribly due to the fact that she is a massive klutz, but at the same time she is very sweat and cares about her friends dearly.\n\nMichiru trama is rooted in an accident that she was a victim of and she suffers from an identity crisis that has nothing to do with her fake-tsundere persona, but is so bad that she is almost suicidal.\n\nThe best girl is Sachi Komine, a girl with a passion for the maid lifestyle and an unhealthy obsession with helping others. Sachi is the first girl you will speak to upon entering the school as she is very suspicious of you being an intruder.\n\nSachi takes on the role from a class rep, who will take on any request no matter how ridiculous it may be. Sachi also has shown many times throughout your run to be someone who takes every way too seriously and has a serious weird catchphrase when someone has to explain something to her when she either has the wrong idea or just being weird.\n\nSachi loves being praised by others, mostly the main character and adores it when you pet her on the head. She also has a weird obsession with expecting you to do perverted things to her or the other girls and has a slight masochistic nature to her personality.\n\nSachi's trama deals with the fact that she is convinced that she was the cast for the people in her life disappearing and so she will do anything anyone tells her to in the hopes that she has to never again experience the pain that she went through as a child.\n\nThe next girl is Sakaki Yumiko, the daughter of the person who is currently funding the school that they all attend. Yumiko is at first very hostile towards the main male character and likes to keep her distance from other, preferring to spend most of the day in her room when not attending class.\n\nYumiko is a menace, always caring around a box cutter blade to threaten anyone who approaches her, due to her paranoia.\n\nMuch like Makina, Yumiko's issues have to deal with her family, being the daughter of a Wealthy businessman, who treats her like a pawn for him to use when he feels the need to and how her fathers cold personality affected her and her now dead mother.\n\nLast but not least, we have Amane Suou, the big sister character who absolutely adores the main character, play the role of the horny big sister character with large breasts.\n\nAmane is almost a enigma as she is quite shocked when Yuuji introduces himself as if she knows something about him, but never says anything.\n\nShe quickly latches on to the main male lead, using her feminine charms and large assets to gain Yuuji's affection. she is very aggressive in the aspect of romance and is not afraid to fault her body to the point where even being naked in front of Yuuji does not embarrass her all that much.\n\nAt the same time she is very shy with simple affectionate actions shared between loves. (like kissing)\n\nAmane always has an upbate expression on her face and loves to make dirty jokes when around Yuuji, that may in fact not be jokes depending on her mood. She also sometimes has a sultry grin on her face when she is trying to seduce Yuuji who usually brushes her off due to being a big tsundere himself.\n\nAmane is charged with taking care of Makina playing the motherly role for the girl, which is best better than some people twice her age.\n\nshe is an exceptional cook having been raised in the kitchen at her families restaurant and has a passion for driving since she got her license.\n\nThat being said Amane also has her tragic past to deal with that she can't seem to escape from. Amane trauma deal with Societies need for a scapegoat to focus all their hatred and sorrow upon, and her own self imposed atonement for something that she had no power over and the trauma of being the lone survivor of an tragic event that took the lives of many.\n\nIt is up to Yuuji  to help each of these five girls overcome the tragic past and find a place where they belong and find a place where a broken weapon like him can belong and find love.\n\nThis is a truly great story that I recommend you buy and experience as soon as possible.\n\nTruly 9/10 work.","May 31, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

However Grisaia blows all of them out of the water due to the your character. Kazami Yuuji is an excellent main character with obvious flaws but also great good points. Seeing him grow through the VN alongside one of the 5 heroines is great also.\n\nAs for the route, so far I have done Yumiko's and Michiru's whilst working on Makina's and Amane's. The 2 I have finished were really well done.\n\nI highly recommend doing Michiru's route, it might be slow to get into but seeing the character beneath the character is totally worth it. Though Yumiko's is such a feel good story. Any of the 5 routes are superb!

It's a pure VN with little choice and hours upon hours of the character's daily lives and the sometimes hilarity that ensues.  The game has a distinct Japanese, comedy-anime style setting and takes place at a secluded school for societal rejects, essentially.  The thing that made me stop was, honestly, the main character, who is just cliche' and unlikable.  He's an ex-military prodigy with zero social skills, constant PTSD, and he loves to lecture everyone like he's their mom.  He is surrounded by five hot anime chicks who have varying levels of interest in him, but rather than set out to have sex with them (which is what I would do if I was the protagonist of a hentai game!), he constantly teases and berates them.  The girls' personalities, similarly, are unidimensional, and it's clear why they can't function in regular society, but ultimately this is where the humor comes from.  I'm sure some people will love the game, but for me, I have to draw the line and admit that I just didn't like it.","June 5","false","11.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

So let's get this review going. This game is a "Visual Novel," meaning that there's really nothing in the gameplay department apart from making a few choices at certain plot-relevant crossroads, but gameplay isn't what we're here for, this genre is all about the story, so what sets this apart from others in the genre? (list of differences to the non-steam version at the end)\n\nThe first thing that catches my eye is that instead of a bland, everyman, blank-slate protagonist like a large portion of visual novels, we get Kazami Yuuji, an unsociable, military-raised teenager not so different from Sagara Sousuke (for anyone who has watched Full Metal Panic). Yuuji is blunt and a bit bad with handling personal relationships, but I honestly have to say that he's a great guy; he is incredibly capable and very rarely does anything negative without a good reason. Our supporting characters are also very unique and each play off of Yuuji and each other in very entertaining ways (though I will freely admit that Makina can get on my nerves). Here's a quick overview of the other students while keeping spoilers to a minimum (skip a paragraph if you don't want to see):\nMakina: Girl with stunted growth and childish tendancies. Ends up picking up a lot of bad habits and harsh language from Amane and Yuuji.\nAmane: Well-developed body and lots of erotic teasing made towards Yuuji. Very maternal and watches over Makina carefully. Also seems to want to take care of the socially-hopeless Yuuji.\nMichiru: Girl who is outright stated to be purposefully attempting to fall into the "Tsundere" archetype, but more often than not ends up looking like nothing more than a contrarian idiot who's the butt of most of the jokes around the dorm.\nSachi: Highly devoted girl who will listen to any order given to her. Often goes around wearing a maid uniform do to an offhand comment about it suiting her getting mistaken as an order (not an uncommon occurence). Has some obvious issues with common sense and flexible thinking.\nYumiko: Aloof and introverted, but has some violent tendancies when annoyed or threatened. Despite this, she is probably the most reliable of the group for tough conversations (if you exclude Yuuji since we're kind of playing as him)\n\nThe aforementioned choices in the game will lead you down the character arcs of different heroines depending on what you choose, though this game makes it pretty easy to get to your favorite heroine since there are very few choices in the game and the ones that actually matter are essentially "Go down this girl's route right now or continue the main route until we give you another choice." Ostensibly, each girl has one more choice leading you to the bad end or the good end, though I'll be honest and say that I can't agree that every girl's endings split into those two categories more specifically, one girl's endings would be better described as bad/worse while another has good/better. Every heroine (Yuuji as well) has some sort of emotional baggage holding them down which got them put into this school to begin with; needless to say, if you go into a route and get details about these incidents, you can get drawn into some seriously heart-wrenching moments of fear, depression, desparation, and rejection as you relive the most painful moments of someone's past.\n\nHaving just replayed the Matsushima Michiru route in celebration of getting my hands on the steam release, I will freely admit I was brought to tears multiple times despite knowing everything that was going to be said, and this girl's route probably wouldn't be considered heaviest of the tragedies presented here (though, paraphrasing some words from the game, "You can't really compare two tragedies to each other," so I feel a bit bad trying to order the routes by tragic-ness). I look forward to replaying my favorite two routes next. As a side note, knowing the characters issues in advance actually explains a few strange moments that I hadn't noticed the first time around, so the replay was quite worth it.\n\nAs promised, I will list out the differences I've noticed between this and the non-steam release. First off, this is absolutely the exact same translation that was provided in the original version (not that this will surprise anyone who knows what a pain translating a game can be). Though I noticed that there don't seem to be translation notes popping up in the corners anymore, so either those got removed or I missed the option to toggle them. Also, on the steam page, you might notice some CG that weren't in the original game; there's a fair number of those scattered throughout the game. Anyway, next up, Steam doesn't like erotic content, so the intercourse scenes have been removed. Judging by the routes I've replayed so far, usually this is just taking a hacksaw to the scene, cuting out the part of the game with erotic CG/descriptions, and skipping to the conversation afterward (leaving a very awkward transition), but sometimes they change the scene slightly and toss in a new CG to make the transition slightly less abrupt, turning it into a chaste, heartwarming moment as opposed to a lustful one. There are also some other changes to the non-heroine moments, like a certain flashback scene involving the captain of Amane's old club in middle school being changed to be less suggestive. Some of the other changes: There was some nudity in the original version besides the erotic scenes, such as when some "girl-talk" was happening in the bath, so the character sprites were changed slightly to cover the naughty bits with soap. Also, some scenes got cut in places, but were removed so subtly that I didn't even notice until I went back and looked at a CG set for the original game (Michiru and Sachi building sand...stuff on the beach got drastically shortened, but I didn't even notice until I realized I never saw the CG of Michiru being burid in the sand (This review has ended up mentioning her quite a lot, hasn't it)). This all being said, they kept a very large amount of content in the game. For example, stuff like Amane standing around in Yuuji's room in her underwear ended up making it passed the censor stick, and if that made it by unscathed, I highly doubt they made many big cuts besides the one beach scene that I happened to remember.\n\nConclusion: Hilarious characters, engaging story, and fun to replay despite (and/or because of) knowing the plot. Easily a massive thumbs up from me. I really want to play the two sequel games, but the complicated language used in this game is making my doubt my Japanese is fluent enough for the task, so I might have to wait until the others get translated...that or watch the anime versions for the condensed story.","September 6, 2015","true","61.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The vn is the first of three popular visual novels in Japan that are planned to be brought to the west. My playthrough including every ending took me 60 hours with me reading at a fairly leisurely pace, so there is a fair amount of content to keep you satisfied. Unfortunately, as you can expect, sex scenes were cut for the steam release but there is an uncensored version and I'm sure you can figure out how to read the vn uncensored if you care about it enough to, I personally found it great even without them.\n\nThe main cast of girls have a good spread of personalities, each with a bit more depth than it might first appear.\nIn the most basic terms, there is a fun loving imouto type character, a caring if lecherous onee-san type, a maid who obeys any request, a borderline shut in who might be a bit on the paranoid side and a genius comperable to Cirno who tries her best to be a tsundere. The mc and side characters are also good, and help keep every hour you are reading enjoyable even during early segments that build atmosphere and character relationships through slice of life.\n\nWhile Grisaia is mostly slice of life every main girl has a hefty load of problems that they will have to deal with in their route and some of it can get fairly dicey. The vn has a great balance of serious tone and enjoyable every day life to it that can make you very attached to the characters and involved in what happens to them later on in the vn.\nTLDR: If you are looking for a vn on steam, you can be sure that Grisaia is probably some of the best steam has to offer. It is a little pricy for some, but if you can catch it on sale I would definately reccomend buying it if you are interested.\n\n\n","September 18, 2015","true","60.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I cried alot, especially during Yumiko's route. The story is basically about a guy who has been a soldier for much of his life and gets to go to an all-girls school. In the process he learns about their past. Through the different routes you get to see each girl grow as a person. The characters are likeable and although you may hate some of them at first, you will grow to like them. However the common route is very long and it will take a while before you can make your first choice, which may put some people off. Especially for a visual novel, this game has great art.

While it certainly has it's own fair share of silly and ridiculous moments, it also hits you with a surprising level of emotional character depth, development, and progression. Like other reviewers have noted: it can be kinda heavy if you're able to get into the story and characters in it.\nMy only regret after having finished one character path is I don't know if I can handle doing it again to try another character - I kind of feel attached to the one path I did follow and I don't know if I can really see it playing out any other way. That said, it's more like reading a book than playing any conventional game - as is typical of this genre. While the visuals it gives you are decidedly nice and well-made, don't go into this expecting to have fun perverted adventure unless you're still a teenager and... easily... roused. But if you enjoy reading a story that's equal parts comical, ridiculous, highly suggestive, and emotionally potent... I can't think of a better conduit to get your fix.

If not my favorite for now.\nI related a lot to the main character: being somewhat without any purpose in life, cynical, detached from everything. Even if he somewhat lack of social skills, and how to deal with these girls.\nAbout the girls: they seemed to have a rich background and interesting personalities.\n\nThis visual novel is very humor oriented, and it's true that's sometimes it becomes annoying. But besides that, the story is very well written, with a touch of poesy and vivid descriptions of sensory experiences.\n\nThe art style is awesome, there's a lot of different interactions and illustrations for a visual novel. Some music are awesome, and some are somewhat mediocre. So I'm a bit reserved about it.\n\nBut the quality of the dialogues, and interactions between characters are absolutely awesome. I think that I will rarely found such quality elsewhere.\n\n(I've only finished one path, but there wasn't any explicit erotic scene, and I must admit that it is better that way. I prefer when this type of content is implicit. I've not done all paths though.)\n\nWhat can I add? The beginning can look long, but in the end it's worth it. The story is growing like a flower, slowly but it is beautiful. Full of intelligence and humor. The author have a lot of imagination, and shows us that even happiness can be reached with such anodyne things in life. And that we can understand each point of view, because if someone behave a certain way, there is a reason to such a behavior.\n\nThe price is certainly what makes me buy it, because I was really surprised that a VN could be so expensive. But know I understand this fact. And it is somewhat justified.

I don't play Visual Novels, and I actively dislike most of Japanese entertainment offerings from games to anime and manga.  So this review is from someone who is not in to this whole scene. I have also read the fan translated version, so my hours in this one don't actually reflect the true hours I've spent on this story.\n\nOne note, this is the "no p0rn" version of the VN, and personally I think it only improves the story. The sex in the fan translated was mostly gratuitous and didn't really add anything useful to the story. I haven't played the story enough to say whether the censorship affected some of the jokes, however. Which would be a shame, because the adult jokes were often quite funny. But the sex scenes were useless. I'll have to get back to you about that.\n\nFor some reason, I just love this "book". It starts as a pure fluff comedy slice of life kind of thing, with slightly mysterious subtext. It helps to be aware of the Japanese stereotypes of "kuudere" and "tsundere", etc. for certain jokes. And make no mistake, there are a lot of jokes in this story.\n\nYou'll be laughing with tears in your eyes.\n\nThe game starts with a "common route" where you make some fairly insignificant choices, and then finally you choose the girl you will be pursuing. Yes, the whole game is basically a romance, with the twist of all characters (including protagonist) being emotionally unstable and having usually huge psychological problems.\n\nThe game also makes a huge genre shift about 6 hours in, once you're done with the common route. The common route is absolutely hilarious comedy, the story then starts to slowly turn more serious and with less humor. Until you will be crying, and this time not because of laughter.\n\nHowever, if you make right choices, you will be graced with a good ending, so there is always light at the end of the tunnel. Just warning you that there will be a lot of drama and it all will look very bleak.\n\nThere's only two dark spots on the VN and the main one is the presence of a loli. That is to say, the Makina route, which (should) give the creeps for anyone who isn't in to little girls. Yes, technically she's not much younger than Yuuji (the protagonist) but the route even plays up her youthful appearance. So, yes, it's disturbing. My advice for those who find  lolis as disturbing phenomenon as I do, is to buy and play the VN but just... well, when Makina gives you money, refuse.\n\nThe second, but more of a minor problem, is the Michiru route. Because that sorely tests your suspension of disbelief. The premise of the whole route. The core of the issue... It's just pure and unadultered fantasy magic. But if you can swallow that, it's fine and often quite funny.\n\nAmong the best parts of the whole story is the protagonist Yuuji who is both a sarcastic badass, and hilariously unable to understand normal life.","June 6, 2015","true","12.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I enjoyed what I saw, but I felt like too much was missing from the original novel. I wanted more.\n\nI came to this visual novel expecting a funny, lighthearted at times experience complemented with jokes that could make anyone laugh, but also deathly serious in some situations. I expected each character to just come across as another archetype in different circumstances.\n\nTwo endings in (Michiru and Yumiko), and I have realized how gravely I had underscored this novel.\n\nFrom tackling powerful topics, such as depression and suicide, and giving each character a truly memorable personality, Grisaia no Kajitsu is without a doubt an experience unlike any other. The ways that each character embrace their "unusual" circumstances are worthy of earnest praise and commendation, and every victory and defeat that affects them affects the player just as much.\n\nSome people will equate this game as simply another eroge in the market and will lament that this is "the censored shell of the original", but perhaps it is because of the removal of the h-scenes that allows one to appreciate the story behind those acts of affection. To simply read through this game to alleviate one's desires would be a massive disrespect to the true nature of this novel, in my opinion.\n\nThe Fruit of Grisaia is an experience like no other. Time and again, I have been truly awed by the thoughtfulness of the plot behind each route, and the execution of the plot to make almost every action feel unquestionably real (even though sometimes the "actions" done are beyond reality. Michiru for example comes to mind.)\n\nIf you want a game that has been claimed by many who have experienced it as "life-changing", then this is pretty much as good as it gets.\n\nMay Tuna-Man guide your decision","July 11, 2015","true","114.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

And by that I mean VNs that take longer than 10+ hours per route. I'm tired of all of these VNs making me shell out $20 for a four hour experience. I'm 10 hours in this VN so far, and still not finished, so kudos to whatever company made this. The main reason I'm tired is because I've been playing VNs most of my life, and they used to be a fantastic experience every time, because they were always long enough that I didn't need to worry what I was paying for. NOW, I can't rest easy until I know for sure the VN is at the very least 10 hours a route. So to all of these companies releasing two hour long VNs, please stop. I want to get immersed in the characters, not watch a feature film. It's hard for me to care when it just stops abruptly and I somehow get an ending with the 2 total choices that I made.","December 2, 2015","true","10.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Thought it was really good. I found out that it was based on a VN, but I didn't want to download a virus-filled, buggy version. Thankfully, less than a week after I finished the anime, Steam announced the English version of the game would be coming to it's store. The game is wonderful, no technical problems to report so far. The girls are interesting, and a few have backgrounds that are darker than a civil rights parade. The art is top notch and the voice acting is well done and hilarious at times. The choices for the girls are few, so to get set on a certain lady's path doesn't take much, but considering it's a 20 hour game per route, you will probably not complain much about the choices. I enjoy this game and would recommend it to anyone seeking a quality VN or for fans of the anime.","May 31, 2015","true","21.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

If you somehow think that this game is over priced, think about the play time compared to other games. It's going to take you about 20 hours to finish the common route and add another 10 or so for 10 of the main routes  if you want to finish the game through and through. I'm at 60 hours and only finished 4 of the routes and I will finish the others. A lot of AAA games you might play will only give you 8-20 hours at most for $60. The Fruit of Grisaia is going to give me 80+ hours for $40. The only thing you might have a problem with is the long common route, which is filled with comedy skits, so if you don't like it, you don't have a soul.\n\nTLDR: "Wallet Crusher Nep-Nep here.
