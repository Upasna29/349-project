Booted it up, started a character on Master difficulty. Died so many times that I... insert Dark Souls meme joke here.\n\nYMMV, but Master difficulty t'aint fer thee faint o' haart, laddy!\n\nI've only played ~10 hours, but I feel like that's enough time to get a good impression of the game and leave a review for those of you who are still on the fence. If you like CRPGs...\n\nBUY IT NOW!!! It's more than worth the price. It's a bit like Eschalon, for those of you who've played that game, but Balrum is expanded and improved in just about every way. It's a touch o' the old Ultima Online about it, too. Just a touch. And it's a good touch. Not a bad touch.\n\nI'm rather eager to get back to playing, so LET'S DO THIS THING:\n\nBrutal, rewarding difficulty? Check. See inserted Dark Souls meme above. (My last death was to a giant praying mantis that prayed away my mana, poisoned me with its horrifying pincers, and healed itself when I finally had it down to a sliver of health. I died to poison as I ran for shelter, sobbing.)\n\nVaried, multidimensional crafting? Check. I can't even. The crafting is strong with this one.\n\nFree-form base building? Check. Build a house, build a fortress, build an orchard, build a farm, build a pigpen, build a spiderpen. DON'T LEAVE THE GATE OPEN ON THE SPIDERPEN FOR THE LOVE OF web web web venom venom death\n\nCustomizable pet? Check. I'm currently running with a giant shadow-magic-wielding rat named Boggles. And that praying mantis monstrosity I was telling you about? Also tameable. The world shall fear my giant green bug... as soon as my skill-level is high enough to tame giant green bugs.\n\nStats? Check. I almost came to tears over stat distribution. The game is neither kind nor generous, but I must have Stockholm syndrome, because I don't even car.\nCare.\n\nSkills? Check. More in-depth than the stats, I felt. Most skills have at least two significant effects, and sometimes three or four. And again, the game does not hand out "learning points" often, so they really matter. Ranks in the Survival skill don't just let you heal more HP at the tents you build, they also let you cure ailments like broken bones, increase the light radius of your torch, slow Fatigue/Hunger/Thirst growth rates, and give you a double digit % chance to avoid death whenever you hit 0 hp.\nTHAT'S A SKILL, BETHESDA.\n\nVaried spells, combat and utility? I think so! (I just came across a teleportation spell that I hope to use mischievously. Combat spells are most certainly varied. I've been using one that creates crystalline walls to great effect.)\n\nFactions? Check, the system is there and the character sheet has a faction affiliation section, but I'm not far enough to have actually... affiliated.\nGiggity.\n\nM-to-the-ASSIVE world to explore? Check. You have no idea. I've barely mapped out Â¼ of the first map, and that's not including dungeons, chests I couldn't open, beasts and the locations they guarded that I couldn't tackle yet, etc.\n\nSecrets and treasures and quests in every nook and cranny as far as the eye can see?\nCheck-checkity-check-check-check.\n\nBrutal, immersive survival elements? Balrum is to Minecraft as Saw is to Teletubbies.\nOr maybe I should reverse that?\nTeletubbies are pretty scary.\nBalrum is to Minecraft as Teletubbies are to Danny Devito.\n\n...\n\n...\n\nI mean Check.\n\nDying of dehydration? Find a well, eat a watermelon, collect falling rainwater (if it's raining, newb) and fill your cantine, or heck, collect swampy puddle water in a bucket if you're desperate. (Pray it doesn't have maggots in it.)\n\nDying of starvation? Hunt deer, chop down a tree, build a campfire with the wood, cook the meat on the spot, eat the meat. Or shoot a newborn fawn with a fireball, skip the campfire stage, and eat fire-ball-grilled baby-meat with half the effort. Then find an outhouse. (Outhouse for roleplaying purposes only. Assembly required, pooping optional.)\n\nOh, and one time I found a bug in my character's backpack eating all the apples I'd just picked. I squashed the little bugger (lol) with my bare hands. Don't touch my apples. ACTUAL THING THAT HAPPENED IN THE GAME SERIOUSLY.\n\nI've not run into any major bugs so far. (Except the one in my backpack.) The game has a classy, retro look that I absolutely dig.\n\nIt's a really good CRPG. There's less choices in dialogue than there should be, (at least in the first main area, which I'm still in,) the writing can be a bit too info-dumpy, and I have yet to find any Necromantic skeleton-army-animating spells, but apart from that, it's a real gem.\n\nTL;DR: For the current price of thirteen-ish USD, Balrum is a criminal steal.\n\nOh, robbing people blind and getting away with it? Check.","March 1","true","58.8"," 145 of 172 people (84%) found this review helpful 64 people found this review funny","84","145","172","64","6"

Make sure you are cool with that before considering purchasing this game even for another moment...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9H3OUDzqN8s\n\nGood?  Now imagine you starting off in an all too familiar RPG back story... we've heard this same sort of story many times before and as you start the game and read the dialogue, you'll swear it's deja vu again.  ..You were a kid and your parents died to some horrible death, something so bad that even dear old grandfather can't bear to tell you anything about it.  Something awful happened is all that you know and your grandfather raised you well as other nearby people of the NPC type taught you some basic skills such as basic carpentry, a little bit of alchemy, etc.  Twenty years later, you now wake up with dear old granfather just a little older, but still much superior to you with ten times your starting HP and MP etc and theres rumors of someone with a torch trying to burn your granddfather and your wooden house down and they burned down the house completely of a nearby family.\n\nAnd that is where you start.  You'll get to wander around exploring the town and visiting all the NPC people, choosing what to say and what tasks you'd like to complete.  The great thing here is that every quest feels like it has a real purpose, none of the "go kill 10 wolves" or "go collect 10 butterfly sacs" garbage that drive so many of us RPG fans bonkers.  It's refreshing to have quests that actually feel like they serve a purpose.. things like chopping down trees in a forest and buying nails from another NPC to repair a burnt down wall of a house or fixing another npcs crop field fence.\n\nBe careful as well in this game.. Don't think you can just walk in people's house and start snooping through their chests and taking whatever you like because doing so in their line of sight will pi.ss them off and have them attacking you until either you or them dies.  I love that.\n\nSo let's talk about the UI...  it's a little awkward to get used to for sure and will take time.  For example sending in your pet (yes you can have pets you command and who serve you) ... but sending your pet to attack an enemy require you left clicking the target foe.  But for you to attack, you need to choose your attack and then right click on the same foe.  ..That's just one example of how the UI can be almost overwhelmingly confusing when you begin.  But soon, you'll get the hang of it and feel much more comfy with the game that definitely doesn't hold your hand.\n\nMy biggest gripe early on is the hunger and thirst survival mechanics of the game.  I chose the normal difficulty and haven't tried the easy mode yet but...  at this early point into the game (4 hours), the thirst and hunger is almost annoying because it feels like every 30 seconds, you have to drink or eat.  Fail to notice these chat messages or icons in the upper right of your screen, you in no time flat you'll be near death from damage taken from "invisible pain" due to hunger or thirst.  The solution?  Easy once you figure out to stock plenty of food on you and hydrate and eat to 150% of both thirst & hunger each morning when you wake up.\n\nThe hybrid turn based mechanic is one I really like.  It means that every NPC (including enemies) move and do their thing and time moves if you stand still or if you are working to complete tasks.. it's a real time game, except once you engage or once an enemy engages you into the games combat.  Once you are in combat, whether your choice or not, it's all a slower, much more strategic life-or-death turn based battle where any wrong move could be the difference between you surviving ot dying and re-loading the game from your last save point.\n\nThere's also a rune your grandfather gives you early in the game that you'll want to put in your hot bar immediately.  I didn't even notice it until 4 hours in, and it allows you to click it anytime to be whisked away to a safe facet of your existence where the map looks the same, but no other npcs including enemies exist.  It's your safe haven, and when you first go there, there is a huge empty prarie the size of the small town all your own.. a place you can build your dream home and escape to any time you wish.  There, you are given a nice starting supply of resources to help get you started building whatever home you want, and pressing the B key (for Build) opens up a generous build menu where you can build your dream home, place furniture, trees, shrubs, chests, etc.  This safe zone is an awesome feature that I absolutely love and to me is something that takes this game over-the-top.\n\nWhile this game has it's steep learning curve and interesting UI to get used to, it offers a depth rarely seen in even the most hyped triple-A RPG games.  This is certainly not a review where I've played the full game and can tell you exactly how much depth it has, but at four hours in, I feel like someone here on earth looking up into the sky at all the stars thinking OMG WOW.  It feels like I haven't even scratched 1% of this games offerings at 4 hours in.  There are tons of ingredients everywhere for crafting and alchemy, more then you can shake a stick at.  There are dozens of dungeons I haven't even begun to explore.  There is a safe zone area I've only started to build my house on.  And there are so many strange creatures I've stayed away from seen peering at me from the thick woods beyond the town.  When I get killed by two spiders near the town or a bear on the edge of town, I can't even begin to think of battling whatever evils exist in the depths of the woods or all of those dungeons yet.  And THAT is a feeling that leaves you in awe as you are learning the ropes and UI of this game and completing all the many tasks and quests available at the start.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that this game will be up for "RPG of the year" on many peoples lists to choose the best-of-the-best from once 2016 is over.  It's refreshing to see, especially at this games surprisingly lose price point.  Many people will compare this game to Diablo or Diablo 2 looking at the graphics, but I have played both of those games long ago, and from my early game time in Balrum, this game may not be an action RPG like Diablo or throw quite so much crazy loot out, but it looks to have a depth that far surpasses both Diablo and Diablo 2.  It does have a steep learning curve, and a strange UI that takes getting used to, but I think this game is one that any true RPG fan shouldn't miss!\n\nOnce I complete this game, I'll come back and give it a proper review, and share how many hours I spent beating it.  Until then, here is my scoring just based on what I've experienced so far...\n\nValue (Worth 40 points max) :  40, no doubt about it, this game delivers crazy over-the-top value and likely hundreds of hours of gameplay for it's small asking price.\n\nFun (Worth 30 points max):  27, very high fun value in my opinion and I expect the fun to increase as I get even deeping into this games lore and gameplay.  This score will be very subjective depending on what style of game you prefer, but I can't see any true RPG fan not having a hell of a time with Balrum.\n\nControls & Bugs (Worth 20 points max):  A few weird control mechanisms lower this score, and the steep learning curve also plays in because it certainly could leave many players feeling over-whelmed... but I'm giving this game a solid 15 out of 20.\n\nGraphics & Sound (Worth 10 points max):  The least important aspect of any game when it comes to value and overall fun that can be had in my opinion, but this game delivers an old school style of graphics that is both dark and classic awesomeness and I love it!  8 out of 10 here from me!\n\nMy initial score that I'd be shocked to see it change much:  90%  Very Solid A-minus grade from me and a MUST BUY for RPG fans at this price.","February 29","true","10.8"," 106 of 151 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","106","151","4","15"

Balrum feels more like a sandbox with a RPG badly tacked on than a true RPG.\n\nI must say that the game is very beautiful for an indie RPG. It reminds me (and a lot of other people) of Eschalon, and that's a high praise! Weather effects, day/night cycle, weapon and armour sprites - everything is done very well.\n\nAnother plus is an extensive crafting system. You can craft a lot of things, from food to potions, from shovels to weapon and armour, and you can also construct buildings (albeit only in special Safe Place, where there are no enemies, and indeed no other NPCs at all).\n\nSo far, so good. But now, the negative.\n\nFirst, combat is very boring. With only one character (and his pet) and lack of tactical options, it usually just means spamming melee attacks or spells until enemy is dead, with occasional healing in between.\n\nMages, surprisingly, have it even worse than warriors here. Magic is not very powerful, and does not GROW powerful even at high levels. In a direct confrontation with a common wolf, a mage has a good chance to be killed. So he often relies on casting Damage Over Time spells, and then running in circles, while enemy slowly dies. This is so wrong and bad, that I just don't know what to say. Even bosses are defeated in the same manner.\n\nCharacter development is boring. The only thing you chose when gaining a level is a one-point improvement for one of primary attributes. But levelling is quite slow, so you'll never build up big attribute values from it. Most of strength or intellect will come from items, so finding a new, better item is often more thrilling than a level up (and happens more often!).\n\nSlow levelling also means you have to be VERY frugal with skills you learn. I think the constraints here are a bit too tight. To be able to wear the best items in the end game, you have to put a lot of points into attribute training, and so have little left to learn less-useful crafting skills.\n\nCrafting is not very useful, at least for a mage. Although alchemy saved me in the final battle, so there is that. But for the most of the game, I haven't used it much.\n\nEconomy is not quite broken, but after a while there is too much loot and not enough things to spend money on.\n\nLastly, the plot... It's not explained very well. Where did the Rebels came from in such force, for example? Quest texts are nothing special, and the whole thing is nearly linear, meaning you won't be able to make any choices that affect the story, like supporting a faction etc. Quests are mostly of "go-there-kill-that-bring-this" variety, but there are a few simply puzzles here and there (mostly, they contain good items, and not plot-critical points).\n\nIn the end, I think that this game took too much from Eschalon. Eschalon itself wasn't such a good RPG in the first place, and this game copies nearly all bad thing from it (boring combat, linearity etc.). It's only saving grace is complex crafting system, but even it can't save this game from mediocrity.\n\nI could not recommend it to everybody, but maybe if you like crafting very much, you should take a look at it. Though it's not Minecraft :)\n\nAh, yes. Also, be prepared for a LOT of walking. Slow walking. Game world is big, and fast-travel points are few and far between. Be sure to grab a special brick from desert ruins, which, when used, speeds you up considerably for a dozen turns (or brew a lot of Speed potions!).","March 18","false","44.3"," 63 of 85 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","63","85","0","0"

Great production value for a small team and small file size.  Nice rpg elements and survival aspects.  RPG elements allow for initial character creation of Fighter, Mage, or Archer.  The game starts you off with a pet wolf that is of some help in the begining.  The controls for the game are intuitive.  It's realtime/turn based.  Move around the world in real time, when you are not moving time is standing still.  The system is similar to the Echelon RPG games, but the animations and graphics are a step up compared to that series. Survival aspects consist of hunger, health, and thirst.  The game has a variety of crafting and cooking options for the survival aspect, also hunting, gathering, and alchemy.  There are a variety of tools you have to have to perform various jobs, and these are auto selected when you go about performing a job, such as mining or chopping wood.   Artwork and music are top notch and you are able to zoom in and out in the game's isometric perspective.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/424250/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2000 products in account","Old school RPG goodness!\nBalrum, which was developed by a two-man team, is an old school RPG with survival elements. What interested me was how it took the basic formula of old school RPGs with turn-based combat and added more fun ingredients to it. It is a pretty simple RPG but it is challenging enough to keep players on their toes.\n\nBalrum is not just an RPG, but a survival game as well. It has a hunger/thirst system, so you have to hunt for resources to keep yourself fed and hydrated. One other characteristic, which I think makes it even more hardcore, is that the map barely gives any information. You have to explore by yourself and add markers to the map, or memorize the locations. Both are a far cry from having a full map handed to you on a silver platter.\n\nRight before youâre thrown into the world of Balrum youâll get to choose from a wide variety of starting skills such as farming, alchemy and archery. You also have full control over distributing your stats. Intelligence and wisdom are good for mage-like characters, while strength and vitality help if you're going for a more aggressive approach.\n\nStory wise, I admit that I haven't gotten far with the main quests, but I've gotten a taste of what is at stake. Many years ago, armies of the undead invaded the world of Balrum. The king's armies were defeated, and a group of people took shelter in the forest of Darkwood. You are part of this group. The story starts off when you realize something is amiss in Darkwood. You embark on a journey to figure out what it is. The game has a lot of dialogue. Be prepared for a good amount of reading, as the game is not voice acted. The writing is fantastic, so I enjoyed reading all of the dialogue.\n\nA short while into the game, you're given an item that allows you to teleport to a safe haven. It's there that you have resources to build and decorate to your liking. You can build a house with different tiles, walls, furniture, doors, decorations, along with crafting equipment such as an anvil and a whetstone. Youâre also able to decorate the outside of your home with different fences, foliage and trees. If you enjoy building, Balrum has you covered!\n\nThere are other optional activites that help to increase your character's combat effectiveness. These include farming, cooking, mining, smelting, hunting, taming, woodcutting, and building. While you can ignore these, I recommend pursuing such activities. They add to your experience, make your life easier, and add variety to the game itself.\n\nThe game involves a lot of looting and searching. That said, your inventory doesnât have a limit of weight like in some RPGs. Instead, it is divided into food, alchemy, weapons/tools, armours/trinkets, scrolls/recipes, materials and quest items. Each one of these sections has its own limit so you can make sure to carry with you only what is necessary. You can also find letters that contain recipes or hints about certain quests.\n\nYour journal is where youâll check your active quests and quests that youâve already completed. Some quests are given to you by other people, while others appear after your character has a memory triggered. I've been going through every side quest I can find before going on the main quest, and I'm surprised by the development put into the dialogue of these. They donât feel like fetch quests, and they easily captivated my interest.\n\nPros:Huge explorable world\nLovely soundtrack\nWell written and interesting dialogue\nSide activities such as farming, building and crafting\nRuns on pretty much anything\nTons of side quests that feel like actual quests rather than fetch quests\nCons:I had to use a third party software called âWindowed Borderless Gamingâ to get the game running at 144hz.\nNo warning when looting something that is considered stealing. I personally find this very annoying.\nBlurry textures when you zoom in\nWalking everywhere can get boring\nOverall experience:\n\nBalrum has been a pleasant experience. I've barely scratched its surface in terms of story content. However, all of the side activities I have been doing, such as farming and crafting, has brought back a lot of memories for me. I highly recommend picking this one up if youâre looking for a hardcore RPG.\n\nRating\n\nEven though Iâm only at the beginning of this adventure, I think Balrum is certainly worth a solid 8/10.\n\nWant more recommendations?

There's Elder Scrolls Online, there's my Witcher 3 expansions, Balrum... and I instantly go back to Balrum. There is something so compelling about the opportunities for exploration, crafting advancement, and building opportunities. Of course, at the heart of any RPG is the quests, and the quests in Balrum have a great feel to them. There is a really interesting story arc building from the quests and I really want to see where it leads.\n\nWhat really makes a great RPG is the feeling of investing in a character that seems real, where the player can truly take on a role that offers an escape into a separate life. It has been many years since I have felt suach an instant attachement to a character, and it does remind me of the way I used to lose myself into RPG's back in the 80's and 90's.\n\nRPG fans owe it to themselves to buy this game.","March 6","true","46.6"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","34","42","0","0"

There is around about an hour of playing before the game mechanics are understood.  I dont really like farming stuff, but it was kind cool in this game.  I didnt do it much though.  I more liked the exploration, and just gathered and hunted for food.\n\n*** Edit: They seemed to have added a new option to make the hunger/thirst practically non-existent* Personally I dont need it, and like being a hunter gatherer ***\n\nActually, I've notice people are complaining about hunger and thirst - this seems like an issue at first too, as the bars goes down fairly fast especially if you are doing activities.  However its just a temporary thing, you very quickly work out that there is an huge supply of apples and food growing all over the place and lots of dear around that you kill and cook the meat from.  On top of that you have an (almost) unlimited inventory so you can collect a ton of stuff then not worry about it.  Plenty of things to steal too :)\n\nLots of secret stuff, dialog and some really good game systems (day/night cycle has a few in-game effects - hint: why are these rocks that look normal in the day, glowing at night?)\n\nLooks MASSIVE.  I mean, really massive - you really feel like your out in the wilderness and there is just tons of stuff to discover.\n\nPlease above all else, make sure you use the AUTOSAVE! Set it to every 5 mins or somthing.  Sometimes the game can be tough if you get stuck into a 2v1 fight early in the game.\n\nLove the old school graphics, reminds me of a zoomed out ultima.\n\n*** Edit: I made a short video about how to play with hunger and thirst on ***\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnCwJD276RQ","March 3","true","20.5"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","32","39","0","0"

I read some positive reviews and some bad ones, here's what I think from my first hour into the game:\n\nI don't die as quick as the bad reviewers said. On normal setting, thirst and hunger aren't a problem since I did open my eyes and notices there's like a 100 times more food than I need lying around in the village. There are wells to replenish my waterskin ...\n\nI do like the depth, in fact at times it can get overwhelming. But that is part of what we like with games with deep/complicated rules systems. You just have to expect that is what you are getting into.\n\nI did get into a couple encounters. My first one were very careful attempts to use the best of my options (playing a spell slinging guy at first) to slaughter my chosen ennemy: a bear. I kill it, it was a close fight. Luckily I have a wolf to help me.\n\nThen I notice another bear, after eating up and sleeping a bit ... but it has a friend I hadn't noticed before shooting my first fire blast at it ... I retreat and get help from some NPCs, we prevail. After that I got cocky with another fight, died ... and restarted.\n\nI expect to be spending a lot of time into a character at some point, but don't mind dying while learning the game. So to me, this game is perfect. I will do a more detailed review if I play more than 40 hours !\n\n","March 3","true","2.3"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","0"

Understanding game mechanics can take a bit of time too.\n\nSo, you play a little retared boy who couldn't find his way around a bush if his life depended on it, and your grandpa asked you to investigate the disapearence of your neighbors, whose house burned down for an unknown reason, but it was definitely not aliens. Probably Satan or something. A woman abused by his drunk husband found a strange tablet in the burned house, and you try to figure out what's written on it while running errands for everybody like a true hero ( feeding pigs, collecting bees, picking up mushrooms, etc. ) Even the village idiot thinks you're his b*tch.\n\nAnyway, you'll quickly discover that the people of this peaceful village all seem to have their little secret, which makes things interesting. And I'm pretty sure I'm gonna save the world or something.\n\nThere are secrets to discover, dungeons to explore, loot to loot and mobs to fight. Sometimes the danger comes from your own backpack, as a worm can spawn in it and eat all your food.\n\nThe game has some minor design flaws, annoyances or elements that could easily be patched, but that could be a no-go for some people :\n\n- you can't run\n- you have to drink/eat/rest quite often ( but not quite that often if you over-eat and over-drink until you're full, it lasts much longer )\n- you have to pay for every skill, and it's expensive\n- the game is kinda slow ( slow movement, slow progression )\n- you have to figure out almost everything by yourself\n- you can't walk through grass and bushes, or crops, collisions everywhere\n- giant spiders\n- giant INVISIBLE spiders\n- giant TELEPORTING spiders\n- no comparison window between items\n- the south is to the left ( what ? )\n- you can't auto-reorder your inventory","March 2","true","24.6"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","28","37","3","3"

I enjoy the elements of real life like eat, drink and sleep with camping in it as well. The dialog is kinda cheesy but also enjoyable to read. It's great to still see these types of classic rpg's still being produced.\nI am really impressed by the quility of this game so far coming from a very small team. You can tell that this game was produced with passion and great care.\n\nI hope to see more from the team, diffenetly a fan. 10/10\n\n\nUpdate:\nI've been seeing some negative reviews regarding the eat and drink element of the game and my response to that is; that it's not annoying or difficult. You have a eat, drink and rest bar that may have to be checked in the option menu to be displayed, but it is there so that you can keep an eye on the status. And it takes a while for your eat, drink to decrease unlike some have said in the reviews, unless your mining then it will decrease a little faster which makes sense. However it is simple to keep water and food in your inventory to fill your hunger and thirst.\nI have been playing for good while now and my inventory is full of food and water skins to last me a long journy, plus my home has a farm and a ranch to replenish my supplies.\nThe game is very fun and addictting, I love the eat and drink part as well cause it sets the game a part from the rest of rpg's that just makes you hack and slash with out any realism to it.","February 29","true","30.1"," 36 of 53 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","36","53","0","0"

Yes, you need to eat, drink and sleep but it adds to the reality of the game. The developers added an option to slow the need for drink/eat even further so it'll be 'playable' for everyone. You can play the game the way you like. Go for the dungeons or like me... spend 16 hours into learning the basics and restarting a few times. Make a steady food supply, train your skills, buy the best armor from the money I made from mining and next I am going to make my own house and farm.\n\nThe map(s) are HUGE if you like exploring. There are herbs to gather, stones to mine, trees to cut, apples to pick and so much more. I only explored about 10% of the first map now and I heard there are 4 or 5 of these huge maps through the story.\n\nThe game looks awesome in detail within the 2D isometric perspective and offers hours upon hours of gameplay.\n\nGAME OF THE YEAR!","March 3","true","56.5"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

It reminds me a lot of 'Divine Divinity' graphically, but with old-school 'Runescape' type questing and gameplay, without the MMORPG element.\n\nIt is an absorbing and rewarding game to play, if you take your time and know your limits. After playing it for three days,  I feel like I have only scratched the surface, and really look forward to playing again, and geting into those more dangerous dungeons. You won't get the gorgeous graphics /effects of 'POE' - but the gameplay is way superior, and much more interesting.

And i love the hunger and thirst option. Because in most rpgs there always the cooking options. But since almost very food gives not much hp, its better to just drink potions. But now there actually a reason for the cooking option.\nThe combat have also some combos where you can mix up som different types off combats warrior/mage -> warrior/tame tank monster -> Archer/mage -> Archer/tame monster to take damage for you. -> Warrior/mage and so on. There also alot off different kind og skills that you can use with Archer/warrior/mage types.   Break armor, Cause Bleed, Blind opponent, Steal hp when enemy heals and so on. You can combo many different types of tactics.\n\nAlchemist: There very many types of potions you can make. -> Heal you're self and allies -> Mana&hp -> Posion and heal. Its all up to you'reself what you want to do because you can make you're own recipies. The same with cooking you can make you're own recipies.\n\nHunter/Taming: I have not tryed every monster, but i think you can tame everything as long its a animal.\n\nMining/smelting gives you the option to make you're own armor/weapons(As long you you also learn to make it)/Tools and materials for you're house/ and its a great way to make money.\n\nFarming is the option for getting Â¨freeÂ¨ food and materials for cooking and Alchemist.\n\n\nThe only things that should be fixed is either to make the monsters to respawn after some time/days or to make them give more xp. Since on master its very hard to deal with monsters, and the storyline sometimes have you to deal with more than 1-2 monsters and quests are the only thing that gives alot xp and you have to have alot of xp to level up. So sometimes you actually gets stuck without being able to moving on because you can't level up, because monsters gives very little xp.","March 3","true","66.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

I like walking  a  vast world, gives a sense of exploration with alot  of things to stumble upon. Does not hold your hand and developers keep starvation and thirst, you can eat plants raw, kill deer or buy food. There is the option to cook plants, roast deer, find wells, fill water bag and eventually you can grow crops , raise animals and again  cook at your Safe Area where you can sleep and even make a water well. Thus hunger and thirst is part of the game, realistic and readily handled if not lazy. Also if you cannot walk around trees and plants then too bad. I like the idea of a companion animal. A well made wonderous game with an excellent price and foresee many quality hours of exploring and learning the lore. It does take alot of experience to level up, but go carefully and earn it. You don't want a too easy game. Enjoy the story, exploration, the journey, and there is enough action. Some players want all action, constant conflict. this diminishes the journey, If not go  to Diablo or some other mindless slugfest. A much improved Eschalon type game, with much improved graphics. I whole heartily recommend this game.

I don't wish to be too decisive at this stage, so I'll keep it general:\n\nWho will LOVE this?\n\n+ Anyone who remembers the gameplay of the old Ultima series fondly.\n+ Gamers that enjoy the stiff challenge of calssic RPGs (the ability to be killed by aggressive mosquitos early on).\n+ Patient people that enjoy an intelligent, methodical approach -- needing to figure out what they're "ready for" on their own.\n\nWho will HATE this?\n\n- Gamers that prefer X = Attack, Y = Power attack.\n- People that want the quick grind/reward system of Diablo, Path of Exile, Torchlight, etc.\n- Anyone that needs constant action and graphical fidelity to stay engaged.\n\n\nAll said, I am really enjoying the game!  I'm definitely of the LOVE category.  Throwback games like Eschalon, Serpent in the Staglands, Xenonauts...(slower pacing; deliberate mechanics; real danger if you overreach)...are some of my favorites.  The story is interesting, though not enthralling.  The mechanics are smooth enough, though not refined.  The crafting is very functional, though not absorbing.\n\nThe above sort of sums up the salient features of the game.  It's an enjoyable romp, and everything works!  But nothing wows or amazes.  I'm not far enough along yet to see how all of the pieces come together, but I'm having all sorts of fun with each individual piece -- quests, combat, and crafting.\n\nIf there's one thing that needs work, it's the game's method of introducing players to the specifics of its mechanics, especially the crafting/cooking/smithing/alchemy systems.  The necessity to explore and learn from mistakes is great and all.  However, sometimes the game is so obscure with its presentation of new things, that you won't even realize THAT something has happened, let alone WHY it worked out that way.\n\nI'm still enjoying myself immensely!

As a result, you can lure any enemy near say, a fireball trap, and this trap will keep spamming on it until he is dead, and since it will be your turn the enemy will just stand still until he is dead. This is a major combat mechanics flaw.\n\n- Certain specializations are not worth being learned because the overall loot one can find greatly overcomes the one that can be crafted with said specializations.\n\n\nThat is all. I rate this title 8 out of 10, it is a good cRPG which is well worth its price, and if some flaws are fixed and some mechanics improved it could become a great hidden gem of the genre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","April 5","true","62.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

There you can build a house, fill it with furniture and crafting tables, build farming plots and livestock stables, and as much storage that an OCD pack rat needs. And you can port there at any time you wish.\n\nSo far the game seems to have a massive world to explore, full of quests, harvestables, secrets, NPC's, villages, dungeons and lairs. A cornocopia of RPG adventure giddyness.\n\nMobs are varied, from roaming hostiles to resource meat and leather animals. They can even pop out at you from digging things up, chopping down tree's or other little gotcha moments.\n\nMany NPC's have back stories, some freely given, most wishing to hide some secret, be it personal or main story-wise. The world itself is fleshed out with its own history and lore, intrigue and mystery enough for lore junkies.\n\nIt's definitely a worthy game for RPG fans who like big open worlds, crafting, exploration, open-ended character development, a home to call their own in, and an epic mystery to solve.\n\nFor the price and the content within it, this game is definitely worthy of any adventure gamer.","March 2","true","16.0"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","10"

Personally I never liked Baldurs Gate. This one however, has so much more to offer. It might not be the game that wins awards for a great story, but the sheer amount  of things you can do in this title is impressive. And the best part about it, everything you do somewhat feels meaningfull. Gathering life plants, harvesting your crops, building a house, planting trees, crafting your custom made recipe armor, robbing a guy homeless, only to have him forgive you (I robbed a idiot, he deserved it, dont judge).\n\nYou have a decent amount of skills to chose from, but you will not be able to get a lot of them, you have to make choices all the way. Some might be better then others, but none makes you feel like it was wasted. There is no one holding your hand here, there is are no checkpoints, no questmarker leading you to the location of the objective, you read, and you figure it out. This is probably not everyones cup of tee, but if you enjoy a RPG with tons of options, and even more consequences from the action or path you choose, this might just be a game you can sink some time in.\n\nI have no idea how far I am into the game, and I honestly do not want to know. It might not have the replay value of many games, but I have a feeling I might play through this more then once, just to try and go another way with my character.\n\nDont let the graphics fool you, this game has more gameplay and options then most AA Titles.

You have to be smart if you want to get all the good things!\n\nFor it's price, it is TOTALLY worth it.\n\nEDIT : Ok, now that I have almost 30 hours of game time on my first and only character, I'm able to evaluate this game better.\n\nFirst, this game is huge. After 30 hours of playtime on "normal" difficulty mode, I feel like I barely did 50% of the game. The first map is divided in 4 zones (N/west, N/east, S/west, S/east) but there is ANOTHER map wich is exactly the same size as the first one. I have fully explored like 60% of the first map atm and just discovered the second one.\n\nSecond, don't expect to be a pure serial killer. The game is designed that you can't lvl your skills too high to overpower a zone and your skill points are limited. You have to wisely chose if you want to be pure melee, hybrid melee/archer, mage, ventriloque or whatever. OR, even a basic skiller who can make better potions/food to compensate your lack of combat effectiveness. Since the monsters don't respawn and killing monsters give very low xp anyway, you only kill when you have to (monsters on your way/boss/for ressources you need) or else it is pretty much a waste of ressources. The best way to level up is to do quests, that is for sure. You can have a pet depending on your hunting lvl who can help you during battles too. Some of them are "dps" and move faster like the wolf, others are more tanky like the bear so you can chose which is the best for your play style.\n\nAnd lastely, the lore is good. like, really good. As you progress through the main quest, you find out more about you, the woods and what happened to this strange land they call Balrum. There's also messages you can find everywhere who act as side quests or just some stories who make the lore even better and certain situations even more stressful.\n\n\nThere is still some things that could be fixed or ehanced but the game is patched really often based on player's feedback. Aside of that, this game is really fun and challenging.\n\nAs I said earlier, this game is totally worth it!! It's hard to believe that this game was made by a small indie group. Very nice work you did there :O","March 4","true","63.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

The graphics are better and there is more of a sandbox style to it not to mention more things to do such as farming and base building. You can also mine and collect resourses for crafting which is also well done.\n\nIt has a story as well but you will spend most your time just tinkering around, with a little more polishing with the story and UI I would rate this game up there with the classics. Anyone who is a fan of the old-school cRPG's will fall in love with this game!\n\nThe Developer is still actively working on it and you can tell he is genuinely dedicated to making it even better...\n\nThe visuals, music and sounds are all well done but the best part of this game, and the most important is the gameplay and I give it a major plus for that.

Unfortunately the game falls short in just about all of the bulletins it promotes.  Allow me to quote their steam page:\n\n"A huge open world with dozens of Dungeons to explore" - While it is true that there is a huge world with loads of dungeons in it, there is no minimap to help guide you when you walk.  It's very disorienting when you move right and you are actually moving down on the map.  Also in quests, they say you have to go to the tower... it was sheer dumb luck that I figured out the place I explored in was the tower they were talking about.\n\n"Spend your learning points to create a pure class or a hybrid class"  -  You will quickly find that there are certain things you NEED in this game... such as lockpicking.  There simply isn't enough learning points to go around to learn all of the necessary skills... especially if you decide you do wish to farm or a cook.  It seems like an arbitrary constraint that doesn't allow you to move up in skill level unless you are high enough level.\n\n"Building" -  you get to build in your *safe* area.  Why build anything at all if it isn't on the world map?  I don't understand what the appeal about it is.  This makes becoming a carpenter foolhardy ESPECIALLY at the lower levels.  This skill isn't practical until very late in the game.\n\n"Farming" - How many of us wants to plant seeds and watch them grow into something you can eat?  That's what I thought.   The nice thing is that there are special seeds you can plant out there, but again, this skill doesn't sound very appealing or fun.  There are loads of players who aren't especially keen on the whole hunger/thirst constraints.\n\n"Tame various animals to be your loyal companion" - but then they become useless when fighting certain monsters.  golems are now immune to physical attack and now only you can hurt it with a certain sword.  WTF?!?  Also on the same note.. why is a level 2 golem whooping my level 5 character??\n\nWhich leads me to my next point.  The creatures in this game can and will beat your little character up.  After just one fight you will be battered and bruised with little options other than running away.  Things do get easier if you get better weapons and armor and skills but not until you're much higher level than the area you want to explore in.\n\nTLDR:  This is for hardcore RPG players that really wants to earn their way through a game. This game truly opens up once you get up higher in levels but at the lower levels this game is quite punishing.  You will be lost and unsure of where to go next a lot of times.  Even after 1 fight you could be down and out or dead. There's just so many things that constrains you that the game doesn't seem fun after a while (such as having a limit to how many potions you can drink in one fight)\n\nHere's a video detailing the above:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/tx3e0haSX_s","March 12","false","21.9"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","19","36","4","1"

Unfortunately, the melee build is VERY weak.\n\nI prioritized strength, vitality, and dex equally, to get a (theoretical) boost to HP, damage, and chance to hit. Unfortunately, strength only boosts your damage by 1/point. I put 3 of the 8 starting points into strength, which gave me 3 bonus damage. For reference, your starter sword does 110-150 damage, and enemies have 950+ HP. So, you can imagine how relevant that bonus is. Vitality increased HP from 1100 to 1200, which seems good, but HP drains out like water once you're in melee. The dex bonus didn't seem to help a great deal, as the character seemed to miss about 1/3 of the time.\n\nMelee characters also make no use of mana for skills, and just need to wait out timers on their skills before they can be used again. Again, this makes the stab-and-run school of combat the most effective one. (For a guy in iron plate mail with a claymore.)\n\nMost enemies also have a variety of abilities that they use on you in melee: poisons, paralysis, fear effects, proximity damage, multi-attack, etc. Damage from these generally does not seem to be mitigated by armor, so you're reduced to either pounding health potions (to a max of 5, IIRC, before you get "potion sickness",) or hitting then with your bleeding attack and running away while they slowly bleed out, 25 HP at a time. Not really fun or rewarding combat.\n\nTo make things more frustrating, the XP reward for one of these life-or-death (usually death) combats is about 25XP. You need 2500 to get to level 2.\n\nFiguring that I just didn't have good enough gear to be fighting...anything, I ground my way to level 2, and then used the resulting "Learning Points" and cash to buy up my armor crafting skill. Made the best armor that I could, but would still get randomly killed by seemingly inconsequential enemies. (For instance, I found a level 1 grub thing. Should be easy, right? First hit it summons 3 friends, poisons me, and then when I finally kill one, it explodes for 300 damage. I had 1250 HP when full at level 2. Needless to say, I died.)\n\nAnd on the subject of learning points, they are used for increasing skills, stats, and abilities, and you get a finite amount per level, which limits the types of crafting you're able to do. Sure, you can get by without knowing all the crafting types, but the theoretical depth and variety of the crafting system was one of the reasons I bought the game, and it was very disappointing to find out that it was limited in this way.\n\nTo sum up, this game shows tons of promise, but I feel that the developers need to re-examine some of the balance and gameplay decisions that they have made before I could recommend this game to anyone.","March 10","false","10.2"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","15","30","2","4"

Remembering old AD&D game titels (like Pool of Radiance) or the famous Baldur's Gate.\nSadly the game is not matching the expectations. The RPG element is a vague story with no player choices and skip-through text windows, the deep tactical combat is mostly staying out of range and wearing down enemies with almost zero tactical possibilites and the exploration is mostly running through woods while avoiding lowlevel monsters that will eat your face and getting stuck in obstacles. And all this happens - or doesn't happen - as you try to figure out what your characters purpose is, why villagers want to murder you after you piked up a random pumpkin and above all, why your dog companion despawns and the all powerfull magic does no damage leaving you in hand-to-hand combat with undead.\n\nThe retro look is really nice and the story might be wonderfull, but because of how gameplay, controlls, story telling, gathering & crafting, fight and the whole RPG element works, I cannot recommand BALRUM.\n","April 24","false","5.9"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","2"

So for people that want that retro feel, stop reading now, and go buy it.   Gone? Ok, now I'll explain why this game is not so good. The UI is straight out of an isometric RPG from the mid-90s. It is very crude for a game where you need to use it over and over again. Example: farming is a complicated mess of right clicks, left clicks, contextual menus, character positioning, and inventory selecting. Really? You have multiple quick skill bars, just like WOW, but no way to bind crafting and harvesting skills to it. A major part of the game is crafting and harvesting you can't just ignore that..... Ok, so why care about the UI? Because a bad UI zaps the fun out a game. It makes doing simple tasks boring and labor intensive. Want to improve it Mr. Developer? Figure out what the character can do and simplify the commands to get to that end result. It's that or implement macros. Other than that. well the sound could use normalizing. Some sounds are deafing and others are a whisper. I like the retro graphics and the story is interesting.","March 12","true","4.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

Then, the develpers, "listening" to the crowd changed some weird â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Before, each piece of wheat took a few seconds to mill, the more wheat you had, the longer it took.  Now, milling 1 wheat or 50 wheat takes 3 seconds.  It's like I'm playing a cheap nintendo game.  Tactical combat is poor; it's basically a form of attrition.  Whoever has more HP and damage output will win.  There is no situation I have found where I can win against the odds.  It's like each battle is determined before it begins; if you start the wrong battle it's game over.  You either just swing swing swing your weapon as it hits hits hits you or you cast DOT spells and keep running away (the ultimate â¥â¥â¥â¥ form of combat).\n\nI don't want to sound too negative because I LOVED this game for a few days when it first came out.  I thought the devs were building a realism sim with combat.  They seemed to drift away from realism to placate some whiny people that didn't want to wait for the wheat to mill.  Also, if you plant crops, they grow to full maturation in 1 day which is totally â¥â¥â¥ because you end up with 50x the amount of food you need and you can just keep selling it.  It's ok, I've been here/done that with games like this.  When I play, it just feels like I'm going through the motions.\n\nI get that the devs want to listen to the crowd, but ADD to what you have, don't change stuff that some people loved.  A big mistake devs of any kind can make is to release a product and then remove/change features, rather than add a secondary choice.\n\nMaybe if it goes on sale to $8 or $9, check it out.  But seriously, check out Underrail.","April 1","false","15.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

With the new option to slow the rate of hunger/thirst and logic that pauses them during NPC dialogs, I've enjoyed a couple hours of playing. Changing the hunger mechanic was not a patch in my opinion â it's behavior was not a bug â but an improvement (based on player critique) to a game that had been officially released, and I have great respect for the developers for doing that (and doing it very fast).\n\nI still have concerns about the hunger/thirst mechanic (shouldn't hunger also pause when I'm reading descriptions in my inventory? I just donât think itâs fun to have hunger constantly increasing when Iâm not actively controlling my character), and other real-time mechanics still continue during dialogs (finite-period status effects still count down and disappear while NPC dialog windows are open), but I've enjoyed playing the game a bit now and intend to keep playing. When I feel I've gotten farther into the game I'll try to write a well-considered review of the larger experience.\n\n\n//==========Original Review===========//\n\nDied of hunger/thirst while reading the dialog with Grandpa that kicks off the game (yes, I read slowly).\n\nThe writing is also poor weak.\n\nI'm saddened because I find the story intriguing, the graphics great, and most of the game systems fine (from what I saw of them). This game was the first time I've bought something on release day in ages, and I won't be doing it again.\n\n\n-----------------\nDevs: I like the looks of this game - you've clearly put a lot of hard work and heart into it, but forcing users to read-as-quickly-as-possible to avoid death (in a game that makes heavy use of the written word), effectively removes my ability to enjoy the game or feel any significant sense of immersion. Pause the hunger/thirst while dialogs are open and I will revise my review. Less critically, I personally recommend that you find an experienced editor to take a pass through the game's text: the constant use of over-short sentences and lack of adequate punctuation make the reading a slog (e.g., there are many missing commas, and you should use quotation marks to differentiate characters' spoken dialog from other text). The writing issues are mostly stylistic, but the end result is that I feel like I'm reading a paper written by a college freshman.","March 2","true","10.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tyronetasty/recommended/424250/","tyronetasty","Ignatius Reilly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tyronetasty/","111 products in account","Wanted to love it, on paper there's a lot to like here, but after giving it an earnest try, it's a pretty underwhelming experience. Robust survival and crafting systems paired with open world RPG, which together don't add up to as much as you'd suspect, because neither of them work very well. You're better off getting a very good open world RPG (of which there are many) or a good survival sim.\n\nMy biggest issue is that the game does a bad job of integrating the two. Currently in Chapter 2 I have 23k gold and want for nothing. Piles of loot (most of it dull, all basically straight stat increases) thrown at you that ends up as nothing more than vendor fodder to further pad your pockets. The only way food plays into the game is maintaining the well-fed buff so I can recover quickly between fights. Farming is merely busy work. With your piles of gold, you could just as easily buy enough food to last you the entire game. So you don't really need to bother with these various farming systems, just get a big sword and kill things.\n\nQuests are fairly generic, and poorly written, with tasks like get me ten of these, go kill this thing, talk to this guy. They make an attempt to give you choices in how to complete them, but rarely are they compelling.\n\nA lot of dungeons are either a one room gimmick or a few corridors, and never anything more than that. And after a point, all of these dungeons are filled with items far weaker than what you have. Open world design is always liable to suffer from this issue, but it certainly doesn't help. I would recommend the designers more carefully consider where they place items, or at least not place them so liberally. I was excited when I found a well-made Scimitar, then I found three more, and then only became irritated because I had run out of bag space due to all the other "fat loot" I had amassed.\n\nDoesn't help that the writing is bad enough to pull you out of the experience, and I usually don't give much thought to a game's story. But here you could skip all of the dialogue and probably improve your experience with the game, that's how poor it is.\n\nI was into the crafting, but even that is pretty limited, and with all the gold you'll amass it quickly becomes non-essential or nothing more than a distraction. You can make your own weapons/armor, but at best it'll be marginally better than what you could find, so the satisfaction is limited.\n\nI will say that the combat is satisfying. I like that enemies pose a significant challenge and require you use your skills wisely. Others might disagree. At times it does become a bit of a chore when you just want to get from point A to point B. Chain chugging Speed Potions to avoid fights is not uncommon.\n\nIf you love the idea of it and still are curious, I'd definitely wait for a sale.","March 19","false","53.4"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

I keep finding myself wanting to break out DOSBox and playing Savage Empire whenever I turn this game on, but the interesting twist to this one that keeps me coming back is the survival aspect. Hunger and thirst are something that you actually have to keep your attention on while you're out exploring, or even collecting materials to craft supplies or even your own house.\n\nQuests have been interesting and the only real downside I've found to the game is trying to find where to go right away in the beginning - sure, it's mostly explained to you, but because the map is lacking details and you have to add your own markers, that first play-time is a bit of a monster to take hold of.  I haven't really experienced anything that would make me not want to recommend this game to anyone that remembers the old days of RPG games.\n\nThe real-time/turn based combat makes for interesting times when it comes to exploration.  You get used to right-clicking to auto-move and then find yourself having to switch to either the keyboard or left-click holding to get around because there's  a damned deer somewhere nearby that initiates combat and then takes off on you.  I suppose that is the only thing I've found myself disliking about anything I've encountered so far - but because of the way the game plays, I couldn't really see a better option when it comes to combat, because real-time would become overwhelming really early in the game.\n\nI will probably complete the game with my first character and then reroll to try something different (mostly because of all the mistakes I've made creating this one), which leads me to the last part...the replayability is there, but I could see how it would become boring once you have an idea of where you're going.  After I started moving around the map a lot more, I started noticing how there wasn't any interest once you'd discovered something and maybe that's just me (I have game ADD quite often and switch around from console to PC and through a plethora of games on both), but in the end, this is a very solid game.","April 11","true","26.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

It's everything I want from a cRPG rolled into one.\nIt's difficult, yet not so difficult as to warrant constant Google searches for solutions.\nIt's expansive and full of secrets to find. The story is gripping and the gameplay only slightly linear, but imperceptibly so.\nIt's varied, with crafting, potion making, trapping, farming. This on top of equiping your character and controlling his/her abilities etc.\n\nMost of all though I enjoy the graphics. The game doesn't rely on fancy graphics to sell, yet I find the graphics to be beautiful and reminicent of older cRPG's which came to make me love this genre of games.\n\nI recommend this highly, an easy 10/10.","April 21","true","33.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

These traits, will determine what kind of class shall we say that you will specialize in. Whether you prefer to be a archer, wizard or a knight you will be able to choose. The traits that you pick for your chracter will also determine what kind of skills you will aquire through your gameplay of the game.\n\nThere is a nice touch that there are almost always choices that you will have to make throughout the course of the game. This might buff your character in a good, neutral or bad way to help you out with fighting. Some of the choices might be better and more obvious than others to some people, but none of the choices make you feel like you have wasted your time on that conversation.\n\nActing like a true and honorable old school RPG there is hardly, if at, no help throughout this game. But that I mean there are no checkpoints, no questmarkers or anything. You mainly have to read and figure it out from that point on whare you go to gather the materials that you need. This could possibly annoy and anger some plays that don't really know what to do, but for some players it's really nice to have a challenge like this.\n\nAlthough the game really does seem to be decent, the combat system is rather being and can sometimes be a bit tedious. Taking it in turns to move to chase some animals can take a rather long time and therefor you sometimes can't get to them. When you are attacking enemies it's boring just standing there just clicking the attack button until the enemies falls and dies.\n\nThe graphics in this game represent the old school graphics that really do look like a old school RPG game. Although the graphics don't look polished, and neatly represented throughout the game these are what the graphics were like at that time of creating games.\n\nPros+ Old school classic RPG game\n+ Has a lot of survival elements to it as well as RPG elements\n+ Intriguing and interesting story\n+ Sticks to the old school graphics\n\nCons- No help throughout the game may anger and annoy some players\n- The combat system is boring and tedious at times\n- No trading carrds or achievements\n\nResult / Final thoughtsIf you are a true old school RPG fan then I would defiantly recommened picking up this game. For what it's worth you are definatly getting a lot of content out of this game, with the old school graphics and a large world to explore it is definatly work picking up.\n\nRating: 6.7/10\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Sometimes You Playing curator group here.","April 12","true","0.9"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

It seemed to have a really extensive world of options and items filled with NPCs and story. After a few minutes though I started to become concerned. The dialogue was pitifully shallow and poorly written worse it was boring. I then realized that my options in the game were severely handicapped by the limitation of what I could do because the skills required to do them are filtered through a learning system that limits you to only a few points per level (5) and you only have 8 levels in the game. Each skill has 4 levels and each level has multiple areas of focus to learn. You might be thinking "oh so you just have to be smart about where you spend your points." Nope you'd be wrong. Now believe me when I say I enjoy dark souls as much as anyone else but I'd also say Dark Souls on some level was fair and made sense. More importantly dark souls was enjoyable because you continued to learn and get better at what you did through failure. Balrum seems to be a game for people who enjoy failing because... well because they just seem to enjoy failing. There really isn't anything to be gained from your failure because you can't become better. The primary source of leveling is through quest completion as combat gives you almost zilch in the way of experience (like 48 xp is the most you will get and the levels cost thousands of points) You could literally kill every single creature on the map and have maybe a thousand experience or so but find a ring for a guard and you'll get 500 experience. Doesn't matter anyway because you are arbitrarily level capped. Because everything and I do mean everything in this game is painfully hard to the point of being enjoyable. If you could actually utilize the skill without being stuck with the learning point system the game would probably be much more enjoyable. I think the reason they choice this was to cover for the lack of content in the game and extend the game life. This becomes pretty obvious from the start when you can't run outside of combat and are forced to move about with the shuffle of a dead zombie. Doesn't really matter though because despite being provided with a map no one in the game seems to know who or where anyone else in the game is located even though according to the story they've all been stuck in this forest together for generations. Like I said it doesn't really make a lot of sense and trying to get anything out of them about what is going on is like something akin to fortune telling by a blind and mute palm reader. So in essence you have a game with pretty poor and unrewarding combat which wants to focus on the story which is pretty nonexistent. If this looks good to you go buy Avernum escape from the pit its an older game that does pretty much everything better.","March 5","false","91.5"," 19 of 45 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","19","45","0","6"
