You don't have workers gather resourses, no buildings to be made, straight to the point; war. And, thankfully, its fun.\nThere are 3 armies to choose from, Germany, US, and Russia, but aside from one or two unique unites, they all play the same.\nI've only started the main story, but have put some time into deathmatches. You can play with or against bots (yay!) and the AI is pretty good..\nWhile I can't give this RTS a 5/5 (no resourses, or building anything), it's worth a try, for sure.","September 30, 2014","true","1.9"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","31","36","2","0"

Does it hold up to my memories? Hell yes. Even now, when I'm spoiled by games like CoH2, This games is still a good RTS. Graphics are good, (Except for the cutscenes...but those are so hilariously animated that it's hard to hate them.) Controls aren't awkward, and there isn't a butt ton to memorize. There are pop culture refences all over the game (Like, one time as the soviets, I captured the enemy base, and a soldier said: "Run Nazis! All your base are belong to us!). There are cheats for the game that give your units invincibilty, insta-kill, infinite resources, and so on. (I use invincibility, I know it's cheap, but it's so much fun to send my Ranger officer headlong at a bunch of tanks, and capture one with no problem). The only problem I have is that there's no "Select All Units" button, or a UI element that shows all your troops. Which, when dealing with larger armies, can be a bit of a problem. I highly reccommend this game. Especially considering it's price. Definitely more casual than CoH2, but just as difficult.\nI will say, the multiplayer maps I have tried with a friend and bots, the ai can problematic as most of the time, they take all their troops and tanks right at the start and just bum rush you while and your friend are taking time to build up your army. But I haven't played it much after that, so...meh.","July 30, 2014","true","63.9"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","18","20","2","0"
