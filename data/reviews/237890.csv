Character customization is fairy extensive, allowing you not just select characters’ weapons and armor and allocate their level-up points, but also select exact skills the characters will have available, and choosing skills that will allow your characters to form powerful combination attacks is important for winning.\n\nThere is also extensive item and skill-crafting system, and every next-tier item and skill you want to use has to be crafted rather than bought in the next town’s shop. Though once the initial crafting is performed, all skills and some items can be bought from the stores if you want more copies of them.\n\nStory and character-wise, Agarest is definitely among the best games I’ve played. Each character in a very large cast has very distinct personality, and most of them defy standard RPG tropes. And with the story spanning multiple generations, it is interesting to see how long-living characters interact with the descendants of the person they once knew.\n\nThe story also leaves the player plenty of choice: there are multiple story branches in each generation, as well as more numerous event where your choice affect your relationship with three potential love interests, determining which of them you can marry in the end of generation (the story is about protagonist’s goals being carried on by his descendants, after all ~.^ ).\n\nIn short, I fully recommend Agarest to all RPG fans, particularly the fans of strategy RPGs!","February 27, 2015","true","457.5"," 209 of 221 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","209","221","0","2"

Luckily, I am one.\n\nGenerations of War, even though the concept of dating sim/turn based RPG sounds horrible, it is actually pretty good. The game offers so much choice to the player. Who you can marry, how you want a particular battle to go, and which lovely lady you can choose to woo over. You can easily get well over 100 hours in this game, and barely scratch the surfce.\n\nHowever, this game has it's drawbacks. Most of the time, events and "quests" are spilt up by numerous and tedious battle stages, that work out like a board game. There are far to many of these, even just in the short part of the first generation. However, this is good for leveling up your characters, and if you complete these battles quick enough, you get a nice little bonus at the end. Sadly, for me this just makes it an experience I force myself to enjoy.\n\nAll in all, Generations of War tries to be different from all the other JRPG's on the market, and it is. It just tries to make it's self too different, when all it needed was some generic JRPG nonsense.\n\n+ Interesting combination of dating sim/RPG. It's not horrible, honest.\n+ You get your money's worth. Hunderds of hours of content.\n+ Awesome anime gallery.\n\n- Story is very generic\n- Alot of repetiton\n- Player interation is very linear. We can mould the story, not the world.\n\n\n7/10","November 25, 2013","true","11.3"," 414 of 483 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","414","483","0","14"

Very long campaign (at least 100 hours of gameplay) with good replay value (if you have the willpower to do it again in new game+). The story is interesting and should keep you entertained. The hard difficulty setting is challenging and requires a good amount of strategy (and exp grinding at some points). Good amount of customization and options for all your characters. Cool skill animations with a good mix of 2d/3d art. The romance in the game is pretty tame and doesnt detract from the story all that much. The only downsides I can think of is that it is a little rough around the edges and may be too repetitive for some people, but, overall, I think it's a solid game for a solid price.","November 25, 2013","true","403.6"," 218 of 261 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","218","261","0","0"

Deep tactical chess board type battles\n2. Party movement based on a world map\n3. Story told in visual novel form\n4. Wooing of girls occurs in choices and cutscenes\n\nThings that I liked about this game:\n\n1. Battles require strategy and planning\n2. The art is attractive\n3. Ability to customize party member's gear and stats\n4. Character personalities are interesting\n5. Solid storyline spanning lots of hours\n6. Multiple endings\n7. Dating sim is a nice distraction\n8. DLC makes things alot easier if you are playing just for the storyline\n9. Polished with very few bugs\n10. Total Japanese voice acting\n\nThings that I thought could be better:\n\n1. Learning curve is steep. Instruction manual is good to read but not included in the game\n2. High possibility for grinding on first play through. This can be avoided after learning how to play the game, but more guidance on this would have been helpful.\n3. Dating aspect more a distraction in this game, could have been more fleshed out\n4. Unexpected spike in end game difficulty\n5. As an older game, the resolution isnt as crisp\n6. Music slightly repetitive only because of the countless hours spent in game\n\nOverall, if you are a fan of anime art, visual novel story-telling and tactical role-playing battles with a bit of dating sim, I recommend this game to you","October 31, 2014","true","188.8"," 127 of 142 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","127","142","4","0"

I sort of enjoy the combat.  I like alot about this game. I intend to complete it but after 40+ hours I am still only half way through Generation 2 (out of 5) and I am finding the repetative nature of the combat quite tiresome. Initially I had soem seriously overpowered weapons in my inventory (some dlc or preorder bonus) which I disabled so it wouldn't spoilt he game by making it too easy. More have appeared in my inventory and eventually I have decided using them just to stroll through the combat and get on with the story.\n\nI really want to see how this progresses  and it is a damn shame the combat is so repetative, there is so much more they could have done with it. There are so many character and monsters to use but you end up just using the same 6 all the time (others fall behind). It would be far more enjoyable if the party had to split at points to spice things up and force you into using different characters.\n\nThe inventoy/crafting/enhancing is quite complicated (complicated rather than complex), it is difficult to make stuff. You need to enhance this item to make this item part then you need this book to be able to craft this item to make that item and so on, none of this is shown before you actually buy/enhance things so you have to constantly save/load to figure it all out; quite tiresome.\n\nThis game is looking like it will be 100+ hours to complete, I really hope it's less as that's alot of time to get out of it the things I am enjoying.\n\nThe question isn't "Is this a good game?" as it is and it has alot of things I enjoy, the question is "Is this worht the time?" and I'm not sure I can say a 100% yes to the last question. I don't fully not reccomend this game but nor can I reccomend it toally either.","December 24, 2013","false","72.8"," 323 of 425 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","323","425","0","19"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bitinn/recommended/237890/","bitinn","BitInn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bitinn/","265 products in account","Agarest is a shining example of JTRPG - Japanese Torture RPG\n\n----\n\n(TL;DR? Now that I have done my playthrough, you can skip to the end of this review and find my summary, updates are left here to show how I got to those bullet points)\n\n----\n\nTotal playtime (so far): 50 hours.\n\n- Time spent researching how to craft a skill/weapon on wikia: 15 hours.\n\n- Time spent dealing with endless and often pointless battles: 15 hours.\n\n- Time spent trying to keep characters on roughly the same level: 5 hours.\n\n- Time spent navigating between shop/blacksmith/adventurer guild just to build an item: 5 hours.\n\n- Time spent loading old save because blacksmith can randomly fail alchemy (this is a feature): 2 hours.\n\nThis left me with less than 10 hours of actual enjoyable gameplay, even less was spent on character development and plotline. Given the complexity of Agarest's various gameplay system, it's a real shame to find none of them produce the joy they intended.\n\nSo in the end, this is more like a piece of torture porn than anything else: Do it only if you are into this kind of stuff.\n\n(unfortunately for me, 10+ years of JRPG experience has taught me the patience required to enjoy such sadistic gameplay, so expect update when I actually finish this damn game...)\n\nUpdate on 75 hours mark.\n\nFinally done with 2nd generation (3 more to go), let me add some more comments:\n\n1. Auto-battle is crucial yet miserable: there are many instances where you wish AI can take over the manual labor. But leaving it to its own devices, will consistently turn cakewalk battles into deadly struggles (no XP rewards for casualties).\n\n2. Seriously, you need a true end guide: as with most role-playing, it might be tempting to play this game "your way". But Agarest couldn't care less about your preference, you will, because of the tight requirement for CG/event trigger, miss out on 50~80% of actual content.\n\n3. Less than 10% players ever manage to get the achievement for completing 2nd generation (just completing it will grant you that achievement). I think this goes to show many reviewers have not given this game a long hard look before recommending...\n\n4. Story-wise, Agarest is an ok game, there are moments that will redeem your manual labor (once again, use guide, or it may just be manual labor). Though I personally prefer more character development instead of "more new characters"...\n\nMy verdict still holds though: this is a game for the persistent fools, such as myself.\n\nUpdate on 110 hours mark.\n\nWith Gen 3 over, time for some personal thought:\n\n1. Auto-battle is useless at this point. AI controlled team will pile on the same monster, over-overkilling it for no good reason, leaving the rest of enemies free to attack.\n\n2. Avoid battles as much as possible, there is no fun in setting up the same combo routine every time.\n\n3. Stop grinding for levels, under normal difficulty just a minimal walkthrough will give you enough experience, given you stick with the same 4/5 non-heroine members.\n\n4. On the other hand, spend some quality time on crafting and researching, they bring in far more stats than leveling up. And save before handing your hard-earned materials to blacksmith's random algorithm.\n\n5. Number of players managed to finish Gen 3? 3.5% of total players.\n\n6. Oh yes, there are unlockable CGs to fill my sored & empty heart, but the requirements are often strict and weird: this heroine has too high an affection for you, so you DON'T get to see her CG, what?\n\nUnless you have 1000+ free hours at hand to experiment with its magical dialog tree and light/dark meter, your best bet is the True end guide: even though the guide will force you into picking choices you don't like (so that True end and CGs are unlockable...)\n\nAlright, onwards to Gen 4.\n\n-----\n\nReview summary (on 158 hours mark).\n\nI have finally got to the true ending (on normal mode), it's time to reflect on my journey with Agarest.\n\nWhat I Like:\n\n- The subtitle "Generations of War" is aptly named, this game does deliver a sense of longevity as player battles through continents.\n\n- Vast number of well-designed characters.\n\nUnfortunately, these seemingly strong points result in larger flaws, both in terms of core mechanics and plot narrative:\n\n- It should have been 30 hours, by spanning battles throughout 5 generations, only 1.7% of all players manage to got to an ending, less than half of them got to the true ending.\n\n- Battles quickly became the main source of frustration, and in my opinion, not the good sort. Agarest follows the transitional "just one more boss" JPRG motto and by end of it, I was completely burnt out from grinding.\n\n- When you have 5 Lead Actors and 15 Lead Actresses, lost of focus is unavoidable. Just as I got attached to a hero, another came along to replace him, in the end none of them really sticked with me.\n\n- Agarest doesn't like players finding out their totally-awesome super-secret heroine events, unless you follow the perfect path to true ending, be prepared to miss out on a lot of them (I got only 49% after true end). Sadly number of unlockables != replay value.\n\n- There are also minor issues preventing me from enjoying this game, such as combo system dependency on team formation, deep hierarchies on crafting system, subpar translation and that damn Blacksmith.\n\nIn the end, these drawbacks are bad enough to stop me from playing the next game in Agarest series (even though I have already bought it), at least not for now...\n\nIt's sad to see Agarest failed to deliver what it aimed to, and sadder for me still, to admit that metacritic scores (45/100) are probably well-deserved.\n\nAll I can say at this point is: there are many games you can play for 150 hours instead of Agarest: Generations of War, and in hindsight, many of them might have been a better choice.","July 10, 2014","false","158.5"," 315 of 418 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","315","418","3","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/recommended/237890/","maderschramm","Shotime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/","1157 products in account","I'm enjoying my playthrough of Agarest: Generations of War.\n\nNow, you might wonder why I'm not recommending it but enjoying it at the same time.  I think the short answer is simply that I don't think many other people would enjoy it.  It's a fine line to walk, Agarest has its highs, but it also has a *very* deep low.\n\nLet's get that negative out of the way first:\n\nCombat.\n\nThe combat is visceral and flashy.  The "Combo" system is well designed and extremely satisfying.  It's *really* close to being an absolutely awesome combat-oriented game...but it's not, and this is due to one critical flaw:\n\nEvery map is the same.\n\nYes, every battle map is exactly the same.  It's a flat 20x40 (or whatever) area.  There's no elevation, there's no obstacles, and besides backdrop changes (used sparingly, I might add) every battle is exactly the same.  I've got some experience in tactical tile based games coming into this and I was expecting something along the lines of Final Fantasy Tactics, Disgaea, Vandal Hearts, or even Vanguard Bandits.  The first battle started and I saw how the combat played out and I was extremely impressed!  Excellent animations and attacks that felt *extremely* powerful and were visually satisfying.  I was pumped to see a "real" map to try out after what I assumed was the training map of a flat grid.  But the next battle was the same, and the one after that, ad infinitum.\n\nAnd this makes combat very boring.\n\nLuckily, there's an "auto-battle" system in place.  You simply let the game fight for you!  So I don't even need to grind out the terribly repetitive combat.\n\nAnd that's where I've found enjoyment in this title.  I spend time setting up my team, leveling them, equipping them, setting up everything and then when I enter combat I pick up my book and read while the game fights for me.  I glance up every once in awhile and watch the pretty explosions go off.\n\nThe storyline is decent, and it has a real "epic" feel with the different generations you play in.  Reminded me of something like Saga Frontier 2.  The character interactions in between battles I also found to be enjoyable.  Also, controller support is perfect.\n\nIt's just that the combat is so awefully repetitive.  If you're like me and can enjoy a game even if the combat is really grindy and repetitive then Agarest might be for you to "play" while you vacuum your living room floor.  Otherwise look for a different tile-based combat title, it's definitely not like what you were hoping for in that department.","October 15, 2014","false","11.9"," 278 of 408 people (68%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","68","278","408","9","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SinicalGeek/recommended/237890/","SinicalGeek","SinicalGeek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SinicalGeek/","801 products in account","I figure that I should pipe in as I see many who have this game on their wishlist.  I have put about 30 hours into the game so I qualify  for at  least a first impression.  First and foremost, if you are looking into buying Agarest you have to realize that you are buying a dating sim (although simplistic) wrapped up inside of an RPG.  The objective of the game is to defeat the boss of each generation and then to pick one of your companions to mate with so that you can continue towards your ultimate quest which spans multiple generations.  Each generation will have you playing as the offspring of the last hero and companion that you picked.  This is the story all wrapped up short and sweet.\n\nThe appearance of the game is a mixed bag.  The CG (as they call it) are actually still shots with text that carries the story forward.  The art and quality of the images are amazing (subjectively speaking).  This remains true for the towns where you will spend your time crafting and upgrading weapons/armor.  The battle system where you will spend the majority of your time shows the age of the game.  The graphics are comparable to the Playstation 1 capabilities.  Your party of heroes are cut down to chibi size and some of us who may be spoiled by newer generations of games might be slightly let down here.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the battlefield is where you will find yourself 90% of the time.  This is both where the game shines as well as where the game begins to lose its glimmer.  To start off, the battle system uses a turn-based grid system with both a move phase and then an attack phase.  Each character uses Attack Points (AP) that they expend by both moving and attacking.  The shared expense of the AP for both phases adds a strategic element to the gameplay.  Obviously you would regret not moving your party member in a effort to conserve AP to find out that now your character is too far away to initiate any attacks against the enemy for example.  The most strategic element of the battle system is the inclusion of a linking system which in short allows you to string attacks together.\n\nThere are some negative things to say about Agarest.  You will find yourself fighting the same enemies over and over and over again.  The battleground where you take on enemies will change into new scenary but only when you enter new areas which can take hours to advance through.  This redundancy of core game mechanics dulls the experience and soon you will find yourself selecting the AutoBattle mode whenever you can putting your attention elsewhere.  This becomes increasingly frustrating if you sludge through eight or nine battles fighting the same enemies in the same battle area just to be awarded by a 10 second still picture of a character who you are not interested in.\n\nWith all this said do I recommend this game?  Well yes and no.  It depends on what you are after in this game.  If you are wanting the experience of a RPG similiar to other AAA titles that have branded themselves as must plays... then No.  This game falls short in too many areas.  Although the game opens up with its own crafting/upgrading system and many achievements to work towards, the gameplay is not diverse enough to keep the traditional RPGer happy.  However, if your main reason for buying this game is to see attractive Anime girls appear on your screen, collect trading cards/backgrounds, and/or enjoy casual dating SIMs this game could be for you.  The artwork is stunning.  The content shifts from mild to erotic which will please many fans.  If you are going to give Agarest Genertions of War a try just don't go in expecting more than what it promotes itself to be.","November 26, 2013","true","30.1"," 47 of 53 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","47","53","2","16"

Choice of mate influences future characters and different possible story outcomes with Dark/Light and turn meter. Can travel back to previous chapters once completed.\n- Art is very nice.\n- Crafting system allows for a lot of ways to change up gameplay.\n- Combat system is and engaging/interesting. Being able to string moves together to make combos (including ultimate moves)\n\nCons:\n- VERY VERY grindy. Party AI in auto-mode is very reckless and will not use skills/items in context (person with Rez skill would attack instead of ressurecting teammate). So you cannot trust automode.Some bossfights are just completely unfair at times due to what the game expects you to be for the boss fight vs what the monsters leading up the boss are actually at.\n- Steep learning curve. There's a lot of game mechanics that don't have a lot of good explanation, and some things that look optional are essential for progression.\n- DLC weapons are insanely overpowered at the start of the  game.\n\n\nOther:\n- Fully voiced japanese audio (with english subtitles)\n- DLC is very optional, but very OP when starting out.\n\n\nI haven't beaten the game yet, but I'm well over 100 hours total. I'd like to get back into it, but I think next time I'll start out with the DLC items to speed the start of the game up.

Each battle takes place on the same landscape with no different tiers and peaks to battle for or take advantage of. Every battle lasts about 5 Minutes or more. Top it off with grindy leveling, you have a time sink for sure. But is it a time sink worth throwing in? I don't think so.\n\nAnd that's just my major gripe.\n\nThe economy of the game is strange and unintuitive. Basically, all the shops in the game are the same from town to town and you have to amass materials from the battles and bring them to the blacksmith to craft new gear for your characters. But first you have to buy the recipes which cost an arm and a leg. You buy these (the game doesnt tell you any of this by the way) from the regular shop owner. Once you do that, you have to go to the Blacksmith and see what materials you need to make the item. Making the item also costs quite a bit, depending on what you need. So if you hit a wall because of gear (the reason I quit this game), you're gonna find yourself grinding for materials for your gear and then for money to buy the recipes for said gear.\n\nIt would also help if the game had an interesting story, but it's just your typical anime fantasy fare. Something that can be done right, but the characters are so stock and the story is so out of nowhere that it's not easy to invest in. I also didn't care for the Japanese voice cast and found myself muting the game due to a little elf girl early on in the game (she's the first character you meet...joy...). I'll give the game credit, the characters are designed farely well, but again, their looks don't make up for the fact that they are pretty boring all around. My favorite guy was the purple ogre dude, who also had the common courtesy to not speak very often.\n\nI can't think of any games I've played on Steam that are like this off the top of my head, but if you want some good tactics games, look for Final Fantasy Tactics Advance (GBA) or any Fire Emblem game. Those games are awesome!\n","March 20, 2015","false","8.6"," 48 of 61 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","48","61","4","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/katobytes/recommended/237890/","katobytes","KatoBytes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/katobytes/","87 products in account","JPRGs have been a core slice of the gaming culture for as long as any of us can remember. We have the gems, and the ostracized. Our present subject leans toward the latter. Why are these kind of games not considered highly, or even forgotten? Is it poor marketing, or weak content that deserves to stay hidden in shelves, accumulating dust? Agarest: Generations of War to an extent appears to be blessed with both. Due to downright reprehensible marketing and mediocre reception from critics, this niche selection has never seen it’s time in the spotlight in NA. Though sometimes, honest tactlessness can be a charm. Granted, “underrated” is not the best tag for this game as it’s covered in blemishes, but it would be most deceitful to say I didn’t have a blast. Agarest: GoW is a generic piece of JRPG history with merits that prove it doesn’t need to be embellished by praise or pinpoint expertise to be enjoyable.\n\nOur 200+ hour adventure starts with the Golden Leonhardt Raglan, and his aspiration of a world filled to the brim with peace and tranquility after having enough of fighting in the ongoing war. In his efforts to save a young High Elf named Ellis, he is reduced to a state of near death. In a more habitual situation, he would have passed, but a lady named Dyshana comes to his aid (No Leo, no story, right?) with a request: his life would be saved if she is granted his progeny to be the leaders of eradicating the forces of darkness. Leo agrees to partake in the compromise, and he, Ellis and some other people begin a strenuous, five-generation journey of blood, tears, agony, hope, and... other meaningful things! A rather stimulating foundation for an extensively long story, too bad almost all the events earlier in the game hold no consequence at all. However, it does get interesting once you subject yourself to a whole 50-70 hours of insignificance.\n\nIn all seriousness though, Agarest borrows many themes and elements from your typical war drama, contrary to popular belief since this game was marketed with a bad image akin to those of harem visual novels. The five main Heroes of Agarest have their own ideals, and question these and whether their sacrifice will bear fruit. The main cast of this game adds up to over 15 characters, with each having their own quirks. From the ill-minded Winfield to the more stoic Vashtor, I never felt bored with this very colorful cast. They all get their own time to demonstrate their qualities, and even though I didn’t feel too invested into them, it was pleasant to see them whenever they’d show up. However, many of them undergo their own internal strife as a result of stored up stress from the war. It doesn’t feel as shallow as I expected, and I eventually started to care for the story as a result of this depth. The story doesn’t raise the bar for storytelling in video games, but it's memorable enough to consider it above average.\n\nFor JRPGs like this one to be separated from the rest it is imperative that its battle system is fairly accessible (as in not frustratingly complicated), paced optimally, and most of all fun. This game more or less succeeds in meeting this criteria. Agarest’s combat comprises of a grid-based layout that plays in turns, similar that found in more popular titles such as Disgaea. Party members and enemies are distributed across the grid either in chosen/fixed formation or by random (Surprise Encounters). Battles will shift from a Move Phase, self-explanatory, to an Action Phase where allies can perform actions such as attacking, buffing, or healing. There is quite a variety of actions you can perform, and more often than not you can combine two or more to execute a more advanced attack, Arts to be exact. There are a lot of these Arts, but honestly players will find themselves selecting a handful of them to use in the long-term. You can also use Special Arts when able to, and even combine those to form Extra Arts, they’re real flashy, and feel very satisfying to pull off.\nNow, my grievances with the system. There are 3 main issues with it that prevent the game from being enjoyed to its fullest potential. Sluggish pacing, exploits, and completely unfair instances. In the few times were grinding is necessary, even minimal grinding makes for such an egregious experience, as the combat itself is generally slow even when skipping attack animations on top of raising the frame cap via the ini file. Also, Running around in copy-and-paste dungeons waiting for an encounter evidently becomes tedious. Post-battle rewards such as EXP wither if you lurk in dungeons or the world map for too long because “balance”. The reward drop is justified as it does prevent extensive grinding or boosting, but there are other exploits in this game that make the pain of the learning curve omitted entirely. Even then, exploits will sometimes not help you during the occasional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Bosses with the range of a sniper, multi-target burst attacks that nuke your team entirely, the whole nine yards, it’s a load of crap sometimes. It is around late game where Agarest starts to shine since these problems practically fade away since you are likely to have superior equipment and an improved understanding of the game. Also given the advent of a more interesting plot as the game progresses, Agarest’s core gameplay is one that is unrefined in its fundamentals but overall rewarding and thus entertaining.\n\nThere is another section of Agarest that should not go without mention as this is what established the product’s awkward reputation in the Americas, and that is the marriage aspect of the game. During your quest to defeat Summerill and the denizens of darkness, you are also in your efforts to earn the love of one of three heroines of the respective generation. Since this is a game chronicling the events across five generations, I would expect this, therefore I’m A-OK with it. How else would you acquire the protagonist for the next generation? It’s only fair. This is done for the first 4 generations of the game, and the stats and weapon the next Hero wields is determined by your choice and your bride’s affection. How will you get your waifu to love you, you may ask? There are certain events in which the MC interacts with the heroines and the player is often prompted to make a choice to advance. This choice will either increase or decrease said heroine’s affection. Some of the situations the MC can get dragged into are pretty funny too. Any more explanation about this is basically spoiler, so you better use your wits (or a guide, preferably) to charm your way into a heroine’s heart!\n\nIn-game events like these can also revolve around characters that aren’t love interests. These scenarios can vary from friendly mischief or more serious discussions having to do with their own personal matters or the war, and both of these can serve as a segue into learning more about a character’s personality. They’re somewhat tasteless to a fault, and some are absolutely superfluous fan service that break any remote sense of pacing, but it just has its own allure I find difficulty turning away from as it adds another dimension to the narrative, for better or worse.\n\nAgarest: Generations of War is an oddball for me. It’s flawed to a point where I can’t recommend it with sufficient confidence, yet I love this game. It’s a collection of many tropes seen before, there’s no good waifus, and the first hundred hours sucked (no hyperbole). I also doubt more than a few people find the investment of up to 250 hours just to finish the damn game agreeable. But SOMEwhere, it clicked, and that’s what it really boils down to. It’s just a solid game, if not just a measly mediocre one like critics suggest. Though, I am confident in the fact there are games that people feel connected to, with the quality or lack thereof notwithstanding.\n\nI gave this weeaboo trash a chance, will you?","August 23, 2015","true","216.1"," 40 of 50 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","40","50","3","0"

This wouldn't be an issue, but you have a fight almost every time you move, and each turn takes so long, that you can spend hours in the game and barely advance the plot. Also. once the characters are properly equiped, there is no reason for you to be there, as the auto-fight will win most fights for you, it will just take several times longer because the AI for both you and the enemies is terrible.\nThe generations mechanic works fine, but the game forces decisions that sometimes affect relationships is ways that don't make sense or are completly unpredictable, meaning that it is easy to ruin relationships with completly arbitary choices. All of the female characters are also straight up stereotypes and attracted to the main character to a disturbing degree, so some of the relationships feel completly out of nowhere and freqently creepy.\nThis game would be fantastic if only they created real variety in combat, which is currently basically spaming the same combo-attacks on each enemy in turn and wiping them out before they have the opportunity to threaten you, and made the relationship system something more like interacting with real people, instead of the eterally loyal baby machines that this game portays almost every female character.","December 29, 2013","false","20.7"," 76 of 114 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","76","114","0","0"

This game is bad. Definitely a candidate for the worst RPG of the gen (Can't decide between this and the first Neptunia game).\n\nFirst of all, the Story. It's awful, god awful.\nEvery character is a complete stereotype, and it's just impossible to care for anyone.\nAs for the story itself, it's so cliche you just know what's gonna happen afterwards. It's boring.\n\nAnd, cutscenes wise, they are presented in "Visual Novel" fashion, meaning, every character have their artworks that appear with a scenery image in the background, and the text in the bottom.\nThe problem is, every character has only a single artwork, with some occasional change in the image in their face... And they're not that common anyway (Not something like Ar tonelico II), so you even get contadictory faces with the dialogue. It really doesn't help.\n\nGameplay itself... Boring.\nThe maps never change at all (With exception of some booster panels, in which you need to be in them to get their bonuses.  But that hardly changes anything); every battle takes sooooo long to complete (5min+ minimum) and, since there's 2 battles (minimum) after each cutscene, it gets boring fast.\nAnd, even if you ignore those, the battle system itself is boring. There's no information at all on anything (Good luck figuring out how powerful attack x is), and there's absolutely no variety on them. Bosses are worse, because all they do is spam overpowered attacks anyway. The only thing that makes it worth it is the link system, in which puts some thinking into the battles, but that alone can't save this.\n\nSoundtrack... meh\nEven some of the worst games out there can manage to have cool soundtracks, so you can get some redeeming factor out of it (Sonic 2006?), but... Not on this one.\nI guess there's some interessing ones (Like the generation 1 theme), but it's just forgettable overall. Some of them I just found bad anyway (Like that boss theme).\n\nThe rest... Overworld is boring (You just move between dots), towns are just menus, and the fan-service (If anyone really want that) require very specific requirements to get, and they're easily missable, so, if anyone wants to buy for those, forget it.\nAnd the PC port is probably the best thing about this game, pretty solid and the controls work fine with the mouse.\n\nI only recommend buying this if you want to see more games of the genre ported to PC's (I personally would buy Agarest 2 if it came to Steam. Not the best game ever, but it's a far superior game).\nBut, even with that, you can just pick the Ys games instead.

There is some character development--perhaps akin to the older Final Fantasy games--but nothing like you'd find in many big-budget RPGs and certainly not what you'd expect in a Visual Novel (which this game sometimes gets tagged as).  The inter-generational idea is clever, but isn't pursued as fully as it ought to be.  I like the romantic choice aspects of the game, but wished that there were more references to choices made in previous generations (even if they were just throw-away lines), and the relationships felt a bit rushed.\n\nCombat: A lot of clever ideas.  Nothing you haven't seen before, but an interesting balance of in-fight positioning, party compsition and weapon choices, and pre-combat preparation, make for a reasonably deep combat system.  The biggest problem is fight length: interesting fights take a LONG time.\n\nCrafting system: Once again, lots of good ideas, not always great execution.  Crafting isn't overly tedious, but there are too many virtually identical items that only serve to take up menu space, and drop rates on certain crafting materials is much too low.\n\nTrue End:  To achieve the best ending, and unlock a series of end-game dungeons, requires a very particular path through the game; something more akin to a Visual Novel than a RPG.  Be warned.  Furthermore, completion of the True End unlocks a series of end-game dungeons (and a small story continuation) that requires a TON of farming to complete--easily more so than the rest of the game combined.\n\nWorth Playing?\nIf you like RPGs with highly tactical turn-based combat mechanics, then yes.\nIf you like story-driven RPGs, then yes, with some reservations.\nIf you like RPGs with fast-paced combat--go elsewhere.\nIf you like VNs with deep stories and meaningful choices--go elsewhere.","January 6, 2015","true","203.5"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","0"

(I would have loved to read through each characters' life, from a young age to adult-hood, just to see how they grow and react to their fate)\n\nOne thing I did like about the story - they did a good job of expressing the long-term feelings of main cast (Ellis, Winfield, etc) you could sense Ellis slowly despairing at the heros' destinies, etc.\n\nMEDIA:\nStandard anime faire - if you know anime, then its pretty much what you can expect from a fantasy setting - boobs and all. (which I think is great personally - I wish more people would learn to appreceitte sexuality - there's enough over-glorified violence in the world and gaming - balancing that dark side with an aspect of provocitive artstyles and sexual innuendo is a good offset - positive energy versus negative, etc)\n\nSetting aside the obvious aforementioned style - the actual drawing style is polished and you can tell care was taken with each character - and there is variety to each character, allowing for different emotions - some other games all you got was a single portrait, regardless if they were screaming or laughing.\n\nMusic is better then most jrpg music - nothing great and outstanding, like blockbuster titles - but also not nerve-grating and repetitive; there were a few tracks I would go "oh I like this one" (mainly certain battle musics). but alittle more variety wouldent have killed them, i'll admit.\n\nVoice acting is in Japanese - which is fine for me becuase I talk the talk - but I know not having english VO's rubs some people the wrong way; if you cant stand it, might as well move on.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nTypical FF tactics style - it's unforgiving to the unexperienced, and those that just want to strong-arm their way through - you need to think during every battle, and plan out your turns in advance if you can, etc.\n\nNot a game to be played with ezmode mindset - it can feel grueling at times - but was persona series ever quick and painless either?\n\nEDIT: an afterthought - I will give a failing grade on PC controls - the mouse and keybaord felt very "twitchy" and it would have bugged the hell out of me during combat - if you have a controller you can plug in, I strongly urge you to, its alot more intuitive for this game.\n\nOTHER STUFF:\nAlot of subtle details over-looked, such as the detail for teh various textures in battle - to the branching choices and (some) long-term consequences invoked ("do I attack the castle or go around the lake?") All which can change the outcome of the end game - yup, multiple endings, - no cookiecut "here ya go, 1 ending fits all!" approach - what you choose to do, will determine your ending.\n\nMany hidden conditions to what events occur, and what the end result will be. (not even touching the soul-breed system, needless to say they thought out every combo of mother/grandmother etc in the whole game, each making a different hero)\n\nworth the money, easily. was a good game for me.

Also it could do with explaining some things a little more such as chained attacks and smithing guides. I would recommend looking at the games wiki to answer those questions, though even that is not a great guide.\n\nI love the idea of the different generations though and I'm currently on the second generation. The story is ok but makes more sense after you read the characters individual bios. The characters are also likeable and I also love the auto feature during conversations so you can sit back and read without having to keep clicking away at the end of every speech bubble.\n\nI believe the game has gained a bad reputation that it does not deserve. Whilst it will not be one of my all time favourite games it is still enjoyable, a reasonable price considering the hours you can put into it and the details ie smithing weapons, creating monsters etc and very re-playable. Basically it's a good game, above average at any rate, but suffers from what I can only describe as a lack of care when it came to finishing the game and ironing out it's creases so to speak.","November 25, 2013","true","91.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

It's relatively unique and revolves around setting up and moving your characters on the board in order to set up "links" between them. These links allow you to chain attacks, trigger special attacks, and provide0other  bonuses to your characters. It's a fun system that you can play around with for a little while. However, every single map is exactly the same, so prepare for boredom to set in pretty quickly.\n\nThe real problem is that this game has some of the laziest writing I've ever encountered. There are so many characters in the game and yet not a single one really stands out in any fashion. Each can be boiled down to a basic stereotype ("silent, brooding guy" "ladies man" etc) and are forgotten as soon as they leave your party. Most of the interactions feel completely contrived and feel like they were written by someone who has never actually interacted with a human being before. What little story there is mostly uniteresting and bland. The plot spans five total generations, which is an interesting concept that makes me wish the execution had been better.\n","January 24, 2015","false","32.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

After that, you get OP weapons and you literally just blow through enemies; the same enemies, over and over again. It takes exactly 1 hit to kill every single enemy and it just gets annoying after a while.\n\nThe gameplay is decent; it seems like any turnbase type of game. Kind of like a checker board and you just move all of your pieces (characters) to attack. It's pretty basic and the menus are laid out and easy to access.\n\nThe scenery is repeatative. Even in FF7 they had different backgrounds when you go into battle; this game has about 3-4 backgrounds in total and it just gets dull after a while because you won't be unlocking anything new.\n\nThe only thing that is keeping me around and enduring all of these repeating processes is the story. It's nice and I like the idea of molding a relationship with one of the three girls you can choose from. I also enjoy the fact that you can decide what path you go down (from what I can see it looks like 3 paths; darkness, light and nutural.) Besides the good, it is pretty cliche with a side of "I wasn't expecting that" every blue moon.\n\nSo would I recommend this?

I think one of the main flaws of the Steam version is that you get a lot of really cool items to start out with that a lot of the characters can use. HOWEVER, if you are anything like myself you take these items for granted and only start to look at crafting new items at the point of the game where you realized you had to have been starting the grind from hour 1. The battles are spaced out with more battles and it seems like only a few characters are actually usable (however there are probably many that disagree with me). I found myself putting the game on auto mode and sitting down on my bed waiting for it to finish. Three generations in, Im having a hard time finding reason to continue. I want to continue with the story, I just have an insurmountable amount of tedious fights ahead of me. Its not that I dont like this game, its that I would caution against playing this game.

I sort of enjoy the combat. I like alot about this game. I intend to complete it but after 20+ hours I am still only half way through Generation 2 (out of 5) and I am finding the repetitive nature of the combat quite tiresome. Initially I had some seriously overpowered weapons in my inventory (some dlc or preorder bonus) which I disabled so it wouldn't spoil the game by making it too easy. More have appeared in my inventory and eventually I have decided using them just to stroll through the combat and get on with the story.\n\nI really want to see how this progresses and it is a damn shame the combat is so repetitive, there is so much more they could have done with it. There are so many character and monsters to use but you end up just using the same 6 all the time (others fall behind).\n\nThe inventoy/crafting/enhancing is unnecessarily complicated. Time spent loading old save because blacksmith can randomly fail alchemy is annoying. You need to enhance this item to make this item part then you need this book to be able to craft this item to make that item and so on, none of this is shown before you actually buy/enhance things so you have to constantly save/load to figure it all out, or google a guide.\n\nThis game is looking like it will be 100+ hours to complete, especially if you want to try to get something like the true ending. And speaking of true endings, if you really wanted it you need a guide. As with most role-playing games, it might be tempting to play this game "your way". I really hope it's less as that's alot of time to get out of it the things I am enjoying.\n\nUnless you have 1000+ free hours at hand to experiment with its magical dialog tree and light/dark meter, your best bet is the True end guide: even though the guide will force you into picking choices you don't like (so that True end and CGs are unlockable...)\n\nThe question isn't "Is this a good game?" as much as it is "Is it worth the time?"\n\n\nPros:\n*******\n+ Interesting story\n+ 2D Graphics and animation that never grows old (for me at least)\n+ Reminded me of old ps1/ps2 games such as Saga Frontier and Vandal Hearts 2\n+ Vast number of well-designed, cool characters\n+ Multiple paths to take for character developement, different stat/weapon builds and story developement\n+ Multiple Endings\n\nCons\n*******\n- Combat repitiveness is so dull that you want to just skip everything and wish there was a Animated Novel version of this game available on Steam\n- Battles quickly became the main source of frustration, and in my opinion, not the good sort. Agarest follows the transitional "just one more boss" JPRG motto and by end of it, I was completely burnt out from grinding\n- Unnecessarily complicated equipment mechanics\n- There are also minor issues preventing me from enjoying this game, such as combo system dependency on team formation, deep hierarchies on crafting system, subpar translation and that damn Blacksmith\n- LOOOOOOOOOOONG story\n- Replayability = Zero\n\n\n\n6/10\nI'm a huge fan of Tactics games as I grew up on them, so I might be a little partial. This game is great for those who like 2D tactics games like Disgaea and such. Be prepared for 100+ hours though of said tactics game.\nIt's sad to see Agarest failed to deliver what it aimed to, and sadder for me still, to admit that metacritic scores (45/100) are probably well-deserved.\nAll I can say at this point is: there are many games you can play for 150 hours instead of Agarest: Generations of War, and in hindsight, many of them might have been a better choice.","May 1","false","21.7"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

You constantly need to research and develop new skills and new items if you want to keep strong and alive in the game.\nI only found problems on the very poor tutorial system, which only explains the basics (and too much basic) from some details of the game, making you take some time to adapt with the game, and I think the game could have some kind of dating system to develop your relation with the girls (just like Thousand Arms for PS1).\nI assume that I have bought them all, but the DLCs can make the game a lot easier, so if you want, you can make like me and have 2 save games, one with all DLCs activated (only to enjoy the game and have for sure EVERYTHING in the game, and at start they help you to know better the game mechanics) and the other one with all of them disabled (this way you can have some challenge in the game).","April 12, 2014","true","42.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The battle is extremely fun and addicting, the combat system is using a unique combo system that i really like, so despite the flat terrain that many people complain, it got the same amount of strategic thinking as Final Fantasy tactics and Ogre tactics (I bet many people is comparing that to this game).\nSo if you like Tactics, JRPG, and a simple version of visual novel, I recommend this game !\n\nPS: You really didn't need the DLC, it just equipment to make you extremely powerful and it kinda ruined the beginning of the game because you basically just one-hit kill everyone, so i recommend to turn off all the dlc including the one that's included in the base game.","January 5, 2014","true","35.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

If you need to know anymore then what i'll be covering, you are free to read others. This will be a short review on my thoughts of the game. (Note at this moment i'm only a little more than halfway through the game at 63 hours)\n\nI've played many Jrpg's in my time from the well known final fantasy, dragon quest, kingdom hearts and soon Legend of Heroes:Trails in the Sky. Let me say this first if you are reading this never having played a jrpg, or any kind of rpg for that matter. Stop what you are doing and think if a game that most likely will be spent grinding experience, currency for weapons or armour, etc... is what you want.\n\nThat out of the way anyone with experience with Jrpg's should pick up this game especially when on sale for what $4.99? Jrpg fans should already know what they are getting into. The story is while not it's strongest suit, is somewhat linear, and anime trope heavy, but it is still very satisfying in my opinion. The story is  delivered in a visual novel presentaion with some choices(routes to take, people to marry).  The combat style is reminiscent of games like Disgaea, and Final Fantasy Tactics. The music, oh the music, this alone is what probably kept me going through this game. This Ost is one of my favorites in gaming. The fast beat tracks kept me on edge, the slower solemn tracks were able to create a great atmosphere.\n\nAll in all this is a great game that delivers in practically every place needed. If you are still undecided, then i believe you should wait until a sale for the game to arrive, but do not skip this game.","May 12","true","63.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

At this point, none of the DLC adds content, it just gives you uber gear to start with (which kind of defeats the point), so you don't have to worry about the cost and amount of DLC packs there are.\n\nNot my favorite game, but I do plan on beating it.... some day.","November 25, 2013","true","9.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

But the other reason was that the backgrounds you could get from this game on your profile were one of the most beautiful I had seen.\n\nSo this is a review basing on the First Generation...\n\nArt:\nOn the conversational parts, the art is really good and it gives a good VN vibe to it. Combat-wise the art isn't the best there is comparing to recent games but I like it due to reminding me of Ar Tonelico.\n\nSound:\nIt's good, I don't have anything bad to say about it but it doesn't make me say "Wow, this is awesome!".\n\nCharacters:\nSince I'm basing myself on the First Generation, the characters give me a mixed feeling. Some are lovable, some aren't but opinions may vary and I'm aiming for the True End on the first playthrough so some sides of them may not be seen. Overall they're enjoyable (especially Fyuria haha).\n\nEnjoyment:\nThe game as been thoroughly engaging so far so I can safely say it's enjoyable. It may not be a good buy if you're not into the genre in my opinion.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n-If you're one of those people that measure a game by its length then this game is for you.\n-If you're one of those people that love Anime, Visual Novels and the like then this game is for you.\n-If you're one of those people that love the Strategy genre and love Fire Emblem and the like then this game is for you.\n\nSo far this has been one of the best purchases I've made on Steam.

Neo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neostrikes/","140 products in account","Very good grid strategy game and a very long one too. Agarest is definetely a series that just won't please everyone since it requires a fair amount of planning, grinding, and at times, also requires understanding of game mechanics such as how the AI works during battles. Most people seem to be scared away from the game thanks to the big amount of DLC, truth is most of them are nothing more than shortcuts to better gear, unlocks for the gallery and such (stuff which can be acquired legit in the game itself with some effort and will likely need replacement later on) and they can always be turned off prior to starting a new game (buying DLC will add them to your existing files however, just ignore or sell or whatever if you want to). Only points such as PP and EP can really ruin the experience.\n\nThe relationship simulation part is somewhat interesting and can change how decisions are taken by the player either because you might end up liking a specific character better or really wants to create an optimal hero for the next generation. This allows the game mix stuff a little bit so it doesn't become too repetitive by changing a good fraction of the party members, the main character stats and even the kind of role it plays in battles.\n\nAnyways. A great game if you don't mind working for stuff, watching a lot of cutscenes and actually care for the story and character development along it's five generations. Going for all titles, true end and clearing the post-game areas can take a lot of work too.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/velikayarus/recommended/237890/","velikayarus","ВеликаяРусь","http://steamcommunity.com/id/velikayarus/","267 products in account","It's hard to start to review this game, especially because it takes forever and a half to finish the game, even on easy difficulty where combat is somewhat less stressful (though by no means actually "easy" if you don't utilize the DLC items, and I don't, though "easier" is a better word).\n\nLet's just make a list of pros and cons and we'll get going.\n\nPROS:\n-Really in-depth storyline\n\nWhile the world has things like elves and such and a lot of typical fantasty JRPG elements, the world itself is very interesting, especially in the way it's pulled together. You have deep lore that I wish could be more expanded upon. The fact that the continents are all somehow super isolated from each other and the idea of crossing over to the other ones is unheard of thanks to some magical barrier? It's really confusing but at the same time, you want to know why. The story spans like... five generations in this one guy's family line and the children change depending on who the mother you choose is. The romance aspect feels kind of shallow, but every character has an in-depth backstory. The world's story also addresses, if briefly and somewhat shallowly in some aspects, issues like racism, xenophobia, and nationalism.\n\n-Lots of possible endings and routes to get there\n\nEven the walkthroughs that I've found aren't entirely cohesive. While it often seems like there's just one path, it's partially because of choices making subtle changes further down the line and what number of "world turn" you're on. If you take too long to progress in the story, that can also affect things. Also, in most every generation, you can pursue three different girls so each generation has its own variable ending and the way you choose to put together each generation determines stats further down the line. There's also a "light" and "dark" morality system, but as I'm still fairly early in the game, I'm not sure really what that ultimately affects.\n\n-Familiar-esque JRPG combat system\n\nTactical map, techniques, and positioning not unlike Disgaea? Agarest has it. While getting used to specific controls and individual attacks may take a bit (though not long), the actual system isn't that unfamiliar to any veteran JRPG players.\n\n-Lots of play time for the dollar\n\nI bought this game when it was on sale for just $10, and I try at least equate each dollar to one hour minimum of gameplay for being worth the price. This game meets and exceeds that by far. Unless you absolutely hate the game, then you can get hundreds of hours of gameplay out of this (I have yet to reach that mostly because I play in spurts), even if some of it's repetition to try and get to new things or to find different ways. With the way events and saving are rigged up, it's difficult to do that efficiently. What really takes the longest though are the fight sequences. You can technically "autobattle" but it's not recommended and that'll still take forever. This could technically be a con or a pro, but I consider play-time opportunity a pro.\n\nCONS:\n-Excessive amounts of expensive, overpowered, and more or less unnecessary DLC items\n\nSeriously, you aren't going to need it unless you're looking to remove all combat challenge. The game when you buy it comes with some but they aren't as terribly overpowered. The game will be tricky but managable without it, at least on "easy." The "normal" difficulty is only somewhat harder either. I have yet to play the higher difficulties.\n\n-Replayability is very difficult\n\nDue to the length of the game, which will probably take at least 50 if not more hours on a single playthrough, you'll find replaying very difficult. It's not impossible and if you work in pieces with multiple save files, which is also time consuming, then sure why not. Or if you're a glutton for punishment, you can just do the classic idea of replaying through entire campaigns. It's impossible to see all of the content in one go around. The game was specifically designed to make saving before a choice to just go back and change your answer difficult. That was its intent.\n\n-Grinding for levels is a pain in the neck\n\nRunning around to find monsters is troublesome because you have to hang out in a dungeon area if you're not strong enough to progress in the story. That kind of goes without saying for most JRPGs of this sort (or of combat games where you gain levels by kicking stuff's ♥♥♥) so that's more of a genre specific problem then just this game. It's not even really a con, so much as just one of those aggravating necessities.\n\n-New party members are often, but not always, super under-leveled\n\nOn my first and current playthrough, in generation 1, when I get the gun-wielding character, he was nearly ten levels beneath everyone else. I never attempted to level him up because it was such a hassle and I'd have to backtrack to places I couldn't actually reach at that moment in the story when they wanted me to use him. And in the second generation when he's still around, he spent like... twenty years not gaining any levels, but neither did anyone else so-- Underleveling between generations is kind of a problem in general though. The main guy for generation 1, was level 23 at the end. His son didn't carry over the levels and started at 18. Quite frustrating while the rest of my party was hanging out in the mid-20s. Also the fact that it's almost a waste to put any points in your heroines because they don't transfer to the next generation either so I typically avoid using them in the party if I can.\n\n-Expensive to revive characters\n\nWhen your characters fall in battle, they will not only not receive experience but they will have to be revived for a fee at a town which is $100+ ($100xlevel). Spendy and inconvenient.\n\nI know there seem like more cons than pros, but these cons are really more annoyances than anything game-breakingly detrimental.\n\nThis game is really worth checking out if you love JRPGs and are willing to sit through a story that takes eons to get through.","May 19, 2014","true","43.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It has awesome soundtracks from the main menu to the fiercest moments of an epic battle against the boss of each generation. The overview is beautiful from to the main land, exploration and in battle. The hero creation system onward from 1st generation uses a "Soul Breed System" so to say, the main basis is to get one of the three heroines you have with you to fall in love towards your character. The more the girl likes you, the better stats for the next generations hero and that sure brings something great to this game.\n\nDLC's for the game are really cheap and useful, some say that the DLC's break the game and make it too easy, ofcourse for the first generation you might overkill all enemies you meet but near the end of the game those weapons do an average damage to enemies and bosses. You can also unlock character profiles, voice dialogues and CG's by buying DLC's which is good for those who don't want to play this game over 500 hours.\n\nBattle system is something everyone will probably like in this game, considering that it requires you to position your characters well and also know what sort of attacks and combos you will do on each turn to enemies, a slight mistake can cost you one of your party members and if you are on a exploration point then you're going to have fun time recovering your member.\n\nAs for last comments I know some people have mixed opinions about this game whenever if it's best off all JRPG's or not but in my humble opinion this game deserves a place in every RPG players shelf.","December 1, 2013","true","25.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Like really really long! So long it can start to feel repetitive. Oh wait, did you take that negatively? Haha, sorry, it's not a bad thing. It's just me nitpicking.\n\nAGoW is a really fun RPG with a cool storyline and lots of fun characters. This game even sneaks in (okay it's pretty in your face) dating sim elements.

It's a very interesting mechanic for this kind of game.\n\nSo,\n\nPros:\n\n-Overall Fun Game\n-Enjoyable Characters (although dialogue can feel a little cheesy or generic at times, it's forgivable)\n-Boss Battles, while like your typical battle, are still fun.\n\nCons:\n\n-Soundtrack can get repetitive\n-The game is pretty lengthy (just for me at least, ignore this if you don't think it'll be a problem)\n-The repetitive setup for each journey to the next plot-point (cutscene, dialogue, run through map killing enemies, repeat (with the occasional Quest Areas that can be a little tedious as they do NOT hold your hand...but that's a good thing in its own right.)\n\nOverall Rating For Agarest: Generations of War:\n\n8/10\n\nWould've given it a 7.5/10, but I'm biased since I am an RPG fan.\n\nHave fun!","June 22, 2014","true","32.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I feel Agarest is one of such games: I bought it expecting a strategy game with adorable anime characters and lots of storytelling, and I got just that.\nSure, Agarest has its problems, so be warned. 1. The combat doesn't evolve, for the most part. Once you've found a strategy that works, you can just stick with it on regular fights, which eventually becomes monotonous. It does compensate a bit with "Surprise Fight"s, in which the formations get randomly scrambled and you need a little creativity to push through.\n2. There is a lot of collectibles with very especific requirements. If you're a completionist, like me, it can be rather frustrating. However, it is said that you can get everything on one playthrough and there are "true path" guides available online to tell you how.\nThese points might not seem like a lot, but trust me, they have caused me no small bit of frustration.

The initial concept is brilliant, a very long tactical RPG with anime inspired characters you can build relationships with and marry and carry over through multiple generations? It may not be everyone's cup of tea but for me it was pure music to my ears.\n\nThe problem I ran into though wasn't the anime styte, the story, the characters, or any of that, it was the core... the gameplay, or more specifically the combat that leaves this funny taste in my mouth.\n\nComing from playing Tactical RPGs like Final FantasyTactics, and Tactics Ogre, my very first shock was that there is no height in any of the maps, you will always be playing on a very bland uninspired flat field which may work for a standard JRPG but for a tactical RPG where 80% of the game is played in combat... not a smart move. Then of course there's the gimmick, and oh what a gimmick it is. There's a very confusing and very artificial game-y mechanic where you perform powerful chain combos and attacks by placing your characters in specific formations on the field. It's not very fun, it makes positioning less tactical and more unrealistic in my opinion.\n\nSecondly this game once again forgets it's not Final Fantasy and absolutely bogs you down with combat, it has the feeling of the "take five steps, random encounter" battles from early JRPGs on the SNES and Playstation. This wouldn't be a problem but battles don't take 30 seconds to complete, they require a lot more precise execution.\n\nSo do I recommend it? Well strangely, yes I do, but only to those who really love the concept and can see themselves pushing through the lackluster combat to enjoy this game. There is plenty to enjoy but it lacks the elements that truly make a Tactical RPG good.\n\nFinally, don't be discouraged as I was initially by the number of DLCs, almost all of them are cheater-y items that make the game easier, and are in no way required or necessary to enjoy this game.","September 17, 2014","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yes... and no.\n\nLet us start off with one thing. If you expect anything like Final Fantasy, Tales series, Shin Megami Tensei or Fire Emblem then you're on the wrong track. Agarest is a SRPG, where the S stands for Strategic. Just as the name suggests, the game focus heavily on strategic combat more than blazing action and flashy animation (albeit Agarest do have it fair share of them). Also, it's not like Disgaea even though they're both SRPGn. This is way more hardcore. But then, is that a bad thing?\n\nAgarest stays true to the RPG franchise with a very generic storyline. Just like in many RPGs, we fight monsters, encounter new comrades (though in my opinion, you get too many of them), travel the world, fight more monsters, save the world and fight even more monsters. In the RPG department, it's very generic but still solid. We have armor-/weaponsmithing aswell as as herbal alchemy and accessories. Specific stats can be distributed on party members by leveling up furthering increasing their strenght in certain departments. One thing to note though is that abilities are not set by character, but instead crafted or obtained. This unlocks the possibility of having several multi-functional characters, such as a healing frontline warrior and a buffstation shooter. Experiment away!\n\nI did mention that this game is for the more hardcore players, but what did I mean? If you expect to get through this game and get an enjoyable experience out of it by blazing through it on easy then you are better off saving your money. This is a game which is meant to be a challenge and therefore played on harder difficulties which is also an requirement in order to unlock the true ending of this game. Also, equipments, character levels and such does not carry over to a New Game+ unless you play on harder difficulties. This game is not meant to be blazed through or a cakewalk. It's a slow-paced, tedious grindfest which ultimately becomes repetitive because of forced events and battle stages aswell as random encounters in certain areas. Even if you're prepared to spend at least a total of +80 hours on it, the game becomes repetitive and sloppy after awhile.\n\nIt is said that you're able to affect the character and the story by the "Generation" system, which basically lets you choose a wife out of three differenct candidates. This is a interesting and a good feature which I'd gladly see more of. However, the interaction is very stiff and linear. You're not changing the story by the different choices, you're just shaping it slightly. That said though, the choices you make affects the affection of the ladies you can choose as future wife, and this will affect the outcome of your child. The stats on your next generation will alter depending on the level of affection you have.\n\nI'll give a breif summary of the battle. It's good. But repetitive. Really repetitive. But that is what defines an SRPG. Don't be fooled though, battles can be very intense. I often found my supportive or less durable characters to get one-shot, or one-combo'd in even normal battles on harder difficulty. Bosses often have strong area-of-effect skills with a huge radius which makes positioning a key factor. You will often find yourself resurrecting your party members if you're not careful. Battle is an experience, and a harsh one.\n\nAs a conclusion, it's a basic RPG with a good "new" feature which makes it stand out somewhat aswell as a lot of skill customization. Repetitive and tedious pace, but somewhat enjoyable battle system. Can be hard as hell, or just plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at times. Very linear storytelling, we are not given a lot of exploring or "free will". Good gallery with both the Custom Graphics aswell as backstories to almost every character. Unless you're prepared to spend a good +80 hours on it, don't buy because to get the full experience from a SRPG one needs to play on a challenging level of difficulty. And this is a hardcore SRPG. If you want a GOOD SRPG though, I'd recommend Growlanser.\n\nOh yeah, don't buy DLC. They will help you in the early run, but unless you move forward by your own skill in combat you will never get anywhere past episode 4 on hard difficulty. It's a waste of money.\n\n5½/10","December 4, 2013","true","282.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Once you've found the best combination of team mates and formation, it's hard to lose, but moving characters around can become tedious. If you turn the auto-battle AI on, be sure to equip it with a helmet, and be prepared to run back to town before every major event to resurrect 9/10 of your party members. There's a lot of text, which mostly consists of people in power talking about where to send their soldiers next, but sometimes the females you can woo will ask you questions whilst traveling. Occasionally, if you think you've made the "right" (or "wrong") choice the gauge will go the other way, which is a tad annoying if you're an "all-or-nothing" type of person.\n\nBottom line -- play this game for two hours at a time at most. I initially played this game for two days straight, but now even thinking of opening it mirrors the feeling one gets after watching a porn video.\n\nBuy this if you enjoy: anime, strategy, and reloading a game until your choices make your favorite girl fall head over heels for you.","February 23, 2014","true","35.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's almost an exact implementation of all jRPG stereotypes ever, and I like it for that.\n\n- Drawn-out introductory sequence about some gods or something that has no bearing whatsoever on anything? Check.\n- Ridiculous attack animations? Check.\n- Confusing jumble of points, stats and skills? Check.\n- Impenetrable crafting system? Check.\n- Default jRPG character roles? Check.\n- Female "armor"? Check.\n\nIf that makes the game sound bad to you, then that's too bad. It's pretty damn awesome. It has more rough edges than a triple chainsaw made of shattered plexiglass, but I love it. I'm not far enough into it to say if the initial challenge keeps up (I assume it either doesn't, or spirals into a forest of difficulty spikes), but so far it was worth it.\n\nAnyways, more about the game itself. Basically, imagine a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of Disgaea, Fire Emblem and Chess. You move around on a world map composed of nodes, and sometimes you do battle. Those battles are fought on small, square arenas with no obstacles, divided into square fields. Turn-based combat. While the setup is simple, the linking system layered on top of it makes it so that it still remains fun and engaging. This is the meat of the game, and it is done rather well, I believe.\n\nCharacter customization seems rather well done, as well. Each character has four or so slots in which they can equip skills. Those skills are divided into categories (like fire, physical and so on), as are slots. So a mage-y character might have two light magic and two water magic slots, while a more fight-ey character might have a bunch of physical skill slots. When characters are linked (very important mechanic), they can use skills in sequence, and certain sequences of certain skills become super skills that are awesome because reasons. Thus, which skills to equip to whom and whom to use and where become very important considerations.\n\nAs for other aspects... The story so far is relatively mediocre, the characters vary from very bland to fairly bland, the voice acting (yes, it's there) is... well, it exists, and the soundtrack is pretty cool at times, unintrusive at others.\n\nI'd say something along the lines of 7/10, with 9 points for the core mechanic, 1 for the soundtrack and -3 for everything else.\n\nAlso, for what it's worth, I play on Hard with all the "dlc" (except the bonus dungeons, which always activate, apparently) turned off.","February 8, 2014","true","9.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's an IOS game, so unless you're okay with playing it ported to PC, then you may want to pick it up for  your tablet.  However, that being said, it's a great port, so if you've been purchasing IOS games already on your PC, no reason to stop on this title, if you've  never bought an IOS game for PC, then this would be a good title to test those waters out.\n\nNow that being said, it's got good voice acting, anime level quality, but it's not in English, the Subtitles are in English, so bear that in mind, if hearing a different language as your reading text bothers you, then you may want to turn the voice off.\n\nThis game is very Final Fantasy Tacticsish in spirit, but a little more complicated, not much more, just a tad more.  Anyone familiar with Final Fantasy Tactics will be able to sit and pick it up a lot easier than someone whose never played that, or any Tactic style game for that matter.\n\nLuckily, any action can be canceled w/ the RMB, unless you confirm the turn w/ Yes, then you got to live with your decision, also before you confirm, you can redo any action that you would like to try a different way.  So for a Tactics style game, it is fairly forgiving.\n\nThe art is done well, and again being a JRPG, it's in that Anime Eastern Style, so if you're not into that art style, then you may want to think long and hard before picking this title up.\n\nOverall, I think this game falls in a very niche category, but I think for what it is, it's a great game, and has great potential, if you pick it up on sale!\n\nIGNORE THE DLC!!!  All DLC can be found in game, or unlocked after beating the game, so don't be scared off by the DLC, and do not purchase the DLC, again, this title is an IOS game, so the DLC is the store purchases from the IOS platform, so just keep that in mind.  The DLC is not something you have to get, unless you would rather spend money out of your wallet to get an item then grind for it.\n\n3/5 Stars","February 5, 2014","true","2.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The decisions you make also affect the character's alignment (dark, neutral, light), and when choosing which of the three ladies you'll want as the mother of your successor (hero of the next generation), be sure to give her good stats, because depending on the stats of the current hero and his mate, the stats of the next hero will be a result of a combination of the two.\n\nThe combat system flows a bit slow, although I guess it's ok since it's turn based.

Even after getting past mundane and numerous battles, the story doesn't shine and player interaction even less. The dialogues are mostly "click-through" with occasional "choices" which don't seem to matter all that much.\n\nAdditionally, DLCs bring extremely good weapons at the beginning of the game which messes up the item progression but I suppose if you really wanted, you could opt out of using them.","August 12, 2014","false","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The storline is immersive and the gameplay is hard, and the dlc is fun! Sometimes I'm like I want to go do such and such, but the game sucks you right back in.\n\nIt's like Fire emblem with more RPG elements. A lot of people dislike it because they do not understand the game rate it low and come back. The first week the game had a 89 rating.\n\nFor example at first the gameplay is fun, but then it yes does have the grind effect. (They also have a auto button.) But the monsters progress like in Japanese games to impossible levels. So while it may seem simple, the gameplay actually in fight modes is a lot of things like how does the field affect the gameplay? (You can CHANGE YOUR OWN FIELD to fight on. Yes folks.) How does certain combos affect different monsters? How do you combine the endless amount of monsters? (Not all of them are charted I think I found the mathmatical formula.) How do you impress the ladies while staying (light, dark, neutral?) Who do you choose the most attractive or the one that has the best stats? People hate this because they just want a shooter, they think thinking isn't for games. This game rewards you for your quick thinking and actions. How quick can you beat a battle reguardless of how boss your heroes are?\n\nOh, and there's 5 generations! The next game includes only 2 but that's due to the fact they included more animations so reading the text is less banal. The game has (for english translations.) one of the best japanese to english scripts. It's funny and sometimes downright you'll cry from laughing.\nThey also include better animations and designed amore fluid game but it's less fun in some aspects where the game does not make you have so much to explore. There's hundreds of hours of replayable game here. So if you hate it I say it's your loss of a game that beats Mass effect in what it delivers in content.","March 19, 2014","true","225.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Played games like these during my childhood and frankly helped me rekindle old times. I originally played this on the Xbox 360 and Ps3 console versions before switching over here. I always loved how we get the choices in every dating sim and the heroines. The choices we have and the usual fun we have with the service in it. What I loved about this game was the endings and the choices for the kids. This game reminded me when I first picked it up a little bit on par to some of Star Ocean, Growlanser, Ar Tonelico, and many other RPGs I've played that included an ending and possible romance route. What I enjoyed quite greatly was the fact that we have in here the grid system in which has been used before like in disgaea. Obviously the link system was a nice mix when combining moves. I remember spending hours rushing through the other areas and taking one route to see all different approaches to it and multiple saves. What I truly enjoyed this game was as usual the new game+ mode where it transfers over. Having the ability to capture monsters with merciful strike also helped and fusing them. Ah I cannot wait to see more from this series. I love it when they make quite the grand appeal. I obviously love many things but wiith great enthusiasm and experience from both consoles LIMITED Edition as well as the ones after this one, that it is worth the buy. You gotta put some time into it but the fact you have auto battle helps it out but don't forget you still gotta click over it's not like a speed through for those who usually think I will just have them auto level. The weapons you make and accessories have extra moves and the fact that you can use some of those moves to help your character with it's abilities although it is tedious like using a fire element skill multiple times just to upgrade one state. However I must state that as usual for the fun and love of Winfield! HOT SPRINGS/Onsen! A must for any generation.Truly this game really etches in a great memory for me.","January 23, 2014","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first time I played the game, it was on hard mode, going for the true end right away via guide. I finished it without the need of grinding contrary to what others believe what this game's all about. In my opinion, you only need the basic +15 stats items to win.\n\nAs for the abilities and gears, most of them require grinding and such as it implies, but that's not a problem! Eventually, you will get new characters which has those combos. It may be a bit limiting, but it's good enough that it will give you access to great combos such as axel rave/execution and several other skills, so no problems there. There will also be dungeons which will simply provide you the gears that are so hassle to do via alchemy, so you just need to keep winning and manage your way through the game wisely. Sometimes the good early gears comes from monsters, so better capture them when you get the chance.\n\nNow when I mentioned that I didn't have to grind, there's a little bit of disappointment to that, because after figuring out the gist of winning in a surefire way, the game pretty much revolved around that mechanic. But I won't spoil it to you, I'm just saying that the AI basically doesn't improve that much especially at the end game, but they will get so powerful via stats and skillset in return. There will also come a point in time of the game where your defensive stats/abilities/gears will not matter much anymore (not totally bad, investing in defense is still good enough to survive "stray bullets"/remainder attacks from bosses) so this is a bit of warning to those who are currently on the early generations pumping vit or investing too much on defenses.\n\nThe only time I've "grinded" for items is when I was farming for 21 pieces of +999 atk, 21 pieces of +999 mags and 3 pieces of magic up+ at the post-game/after the ending since I was for preparing for new game+... God damn that was boring, but the effort was worth it, because it made it possible to finish the entire game in less than 6 hours (!) via stardust and rapid stream (rapid move+blast) and the auto battle feature (Q key) and skipping the dialog/animations. It was so imbalanced to the point even the hardest bosses died from the crappy AI auto battle...!\n\nNow when it comes to the controls and slowness of the gameplay, Ghostlight should /really/ make the default fps of the game at the agarest.ini file to 45 or 50 (50 smoothens the camera scroll on my end) and remap the keys to popularly used ones like - z(enter) x(select/jump) c (info/f key) and ctrl for skipping text rather than E key. I only figured all of this out after one playthrough. Oh, and I also didn't know that I could move across continents only until when I'm about to finish the game. I had to travel to the Frozen woods to get to Los Soleili or w/e that place's name is at gen 3. So it's better to name the "move area" as "world map" imo. These simple DOABLE changes can make the game experience a LOT better for players.\n\nAs for the story, it's really great, I like games whose stories breaks off the clicheness at some point (chapter 3 and above really shined for me). there's just SO MUCH battles in between at times that it burns your brain out from thinking of strategies to win. I highly suggest improving the FPS like I mentioned above and use the auto battle to position your characters automatically/link them then disable it in the action phase to save you lots of time.\n\nAll in all, the game is awesome, it just needs a bit of tweaking and learning, just keep on playing and it will really pay off.","April 14, 2014","true","93.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gameplay is extremely slow. It's a S-JRPG so plays a lot like Disgaea and/or Final Fantasy Tactics (or for the PC'er only crowd.... think Civilization combined with Xcom, but much slower thanks to all the steps you have to go thru to do stuff and with a Dialog Storyline engaging enough to force you to go thru all the tedium gameplay). Text is all voiced, but voiced in Japanese. All Battle Engine Voices are in Japanese with no subtitles. but you can guess what corny lines they are saying. between  grunts.\n\nI don't know which version of Agarest 1 the PC version is based from. Most likely it's from the Xbox360 version, which happens to be the version with the most content. Doesn't seem to have any rumble for your gamepad. Pretty sure the PS3 version had Rumble effects. Console versions of this game allowed end data save transfers from Agarest to Agarest: Zero, and Agarest: Zero to Agarest 2. Have no idea if they plan on porting Zero and 2 to Steam and if they do , if the games will have the same end save data transfers that the Console versions had.\n\nGame is typical of Compile Heart as far as girls in skimpy outfits and other such things. Barely started it myself, but if it's anything like Zero. Then the game is gonna be part Japanese Dating Sim, as well...\n\nOh... and the trading cards. They seem to average about .80cents to a $1.15. Pretty sure that makes them the most expensive cards on Steam, right now.

With multiple difficulties, paths to choose from and new game+ it has a decent replay value despite it's initial "time sink".\n\nPro & Con Points\nThe Combat System is AGoW's strong point with an array of skills and combos to perform. You can create powerful characters and do insane combos through the link system that can take down hardest encounters easily if executed right.\n\nThe mid point would be the Story, Crafting System and Adventure Guild Rewards. While the story is typical, choosing your mate and alignment makes for an ineresting twist to keep you interested. The Crafting System allows you create & upgrade powerful equipment that gives you a clear edge in battles. The Adventure Guild rewards you based on your acheivements in battle and Item/currency accumulation.\n\nThe Weak point of this game is the "Time" required to fully enjoy all the game has to offer. AGoW can take anywhere from 40 to 60 hours to complete on a generic play through. To delve deeper can run you in excess of 80 to 100 hours.

I reccomend it to those who are fans of anime, JRPG's, and strategic combat all at the same level, if not steer clear. It has the typical anime story of a guy who must save the world, but in this one he must give the souls of his children to a mysterious deity, which is kinda cool, so needless to say you must choose between a set of girls that you want to have a kid with, be forwarned that whichever girl you choose will also affect the kids starting skills and weapon, so choose wisely. I also want to point out that if you get this game on steam, do not add any of the extra pp to your characters at the beggining of the game, it will make you too OP and the game will be no fun. THIS GAME IS HARD FOR THE UNINTELLIGENT, if you play western RPG's where all you do is press X to win i.e. all new final fantasy games, then you will be frustrated at first. This game takes a lot of math skills and memorization of your characters movements, placements, magic and attack power, hit chance, skills and skill combinations between allies and themselves, but as soon as you figure out who needs to be where for each enemy you will feel like a peasant who became a king.","February 8, 2014","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But very alienating interface and a lack of manual pose problems.\n\nIt has a crafting system and a creature system, both of which give decent motivations for grinding. It has the usual JRPG style leveling system for heroes, meaning that they don't all share levels and you have to make up your mind about which 6 characters out of the 32 to use. It has an achievement system with some rewards, and these too will keep you busy. The morality system is unusual to western audience as it rewards neutrality, more so than being light/dark. There is also a secret ending that opens up a whole new act - somewhat resembling the "endgame" in certain MMOs.\n\nThere is an Agarest Wiki, as well as a dedicated page at GameFaq. Both pages are compulsory for a good experience. Starting the game on hard mode is recommended; doing so without a guide is not. This is due to the lack of manual more than anything else.\n\nThis game passes the Bechdel test, but all five protagonists are male. There is a "6th protagonist" who is female, but you'll have to unlock the secret ending.","December 6, 2013","true","465.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Lots of dialoge that you have to press a button to advance. Cut scenes would have been nice for the endless dialogue. Smithing decent weapons, armor, is a pain. Battle graphics are pretty meh as well.\n\nThe good: This is an RPG across generations. At  critical moments you woo female companions that ultimately you father the next generation of hero with. Your choices have consequences on the future. Combo hits, wrecking faces, chaining hits together.

It's fairly simple compared to its 360 Record of Agarest Wars, but I wasn't expecting the gap in quality to be this big, at least in characterization.\n\nThis really plays on all the stereotypes pretty hard. Though that is essentially the routine in these RRPGs and I LOVE Record of Agarest Wars dearly, but this game doesn't do much outside of the archtypes it picks for each character personality. For my it isn't a turn off so much, it sticks to the formula to a T. Well update as I unlock more characters.\n\nThis game if going to be a hit or miss for many, though I highly recommend you pick it up for the price alone, the ability BREAK of combining two or more moves to create a uniqie ART ability that deals insane damage is a lot of fun, very Phantasy Star 4 only you don't need to organized your whole party to do these.\n\nGame is actually fun and all the actual relevant game content is included in the base game, despite the company's silly labeling of 95 dollars would of DLC that is nothing but for those too impatient to play the actual game. The 'Bonus' Dungeons 1-5 and such are offered FREE of charge with rest being items that can be unlocked through gameplay itself for the most part.\n\nIf you like games like Makai Kingdom, Growlancer (god that game needs a steam release), and dating sims, this is a pretty good start. Maybe I should of said Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea for those less familiar with the first two I mentioned, but if you catch this game on a 50% of more sale, you might find it an interesting mix of genre of a game worth your time if you're willing.\n\nI paid full price for it and I have no regrets so far. It doesn't add to the archtypes, but it doesn't stray away from them either, characters are cute and generally likable. It's really hit or miss and I would only recommend this title to people who are into turned based JRPGs.\n\nJust please don't compare this one to Record of Agarest Wars, this title here is very generic but it is by no means a bad game because of it. I only hope Ghostlight will bring over Record of Agarest Wars to Steam as well, this series certainly is very underrated and even this title will grow on you as you play.\n\nI cannot stress this enough, do not expect grade A dialogue, the narratives are amazing, the story itself is good, but the characters are generic, if not for the very talented and pleasing to listen to VAs who took a bland script and added much life into these cookie cutter personalities.\n\n\nGameplay 6.5/10\nDifficulty Balance 10/10 Does not affect the story, so unless you're like me and go for challenge with your story, so choosing Normal or Easy will not punish you.\n\nIt's worth the price for me, and I hope you give it a try and help how support to Ghostlight to bring over more of their more recent titles!","December 30, 2013","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is a lot of depth to the combat, and pulling off multi-character combos can be satisfying. For combos character positioning is very important. Out of combat you'll find a lot to do including crafting/upgrading weapons and armor, changing out skills, learning new skills, and it goes on. However the game does get very repetitive, forcing you to complete the same exact battle multiple times before you can proceed to the next event/dungeon. The battle maps themselves are very bare, with no terrain to speak of, and they are rehashed way too often. The plot is nothing to write home about. Character interactions are forgettable at best, and cringeworthy at worst (Except maybe for Winfield, he has his moments.)\n\nA decent game that is definitely worth getting if on sale, and you can ignore the DLC (which is just a bunch of early game breaking set of items.)

For me, I felt like this game was on the gameplay style of Final Fantasy, yet it gives its own unique perspective on RPG's. The fact that there are multiple generation lines that are affected by your own choices (between your path of light and dark, and choice of affection with certain characters, something I was unsure of at first but grew very fond of in the end) makes this game versatile and worth playing over again (trying to see what the other options would hold to as their stories progress). This game gets my vote for a game that RPG enthusiasts should check out and play through at LEAST a couple of times to gain that diversity of character outcomes. I even went and picked up the Xbox 360 "prequel" to this game and once I finish the PC game will be looking at that one as well.

The battles are all usually the same except for occasional variety, the story line (Dialogue I meant) is pathetic, the relationship gauge is entirely stupid, but the combat itself (if you get used to repetition) is quite entertaining. It encourages strategic thinking and placement and if you make a mistake, its repricussions are usually dire. I have not played this game on easy or normal mode, just skipped those and went straight to hard mode because man mode. The DLC weapons and items are 100% a waste of money unless one wants to breeze through the whole game, and using only silver weapons for a good amout of Generation ONE is so frustratingly challenging(Silver Sword trick gives lots of them :|).

If you just want to see my score and pros / cons of this game, skip to the end.\n\nAgarest: Generations of War is a tactical JRPG (Japanese Role Playing Game). Being a JRPG, you should be prepared for severe grinding at times, especially if playing in highest difficulty level. The free DLC that come with the game can ease up the beginning, but the gear won't last through the whole game and there is little you can do about it but grind for levels and better gear. On the third generation, things start getting tougher. Having ignored some of the game mechanics during the first two generations, depending on my superior equipment and characters who continue with you between generations, I was stuttered when I was thrown in a game-over-hell nearing the end of third generation.\n\nThe story begins when a young man, Leonhardt, leads a small unit to conquer more land for his king. Leonhardt wonders if he is doing the right thing and betrays his king when he saves a young elf girl from his own men. A dark knight arrives, mortally wounding Leonhardt, but not finishing him off. Before he passes away, Leonhardt is visited by a mysterious woman who saves his life and grants him the power to fight against the darkness, but at a price: he must eventually sacrifice himself as a "Spirit Vessel" to seal the great pillar in the land, and his descendants are destined to the same fate.\n\nWhich brings me to the next point: generations. Each generation consists of a single continent with multiple dungeons and goals to accomplish. During your journeys, you will meet several women who are destined to end up as your soul mates. By initiating events on the world map, the affections of these women towards your hero will change. At the end of each generation, you will be able to marry one of the girls you meet, but only if she cares much about you.\n\nSince you are required to sacrifice yourself in order to seal the pillar at the end, your hero won't continue to the next generation. Each generation follows the same principle: You will have a boy, your hero and all wife candidates sacrifice themselves and the rest of the party travels to the next continent. The next generation starts as your child approaches adulthood. At first I was put off by the fact you lose your hero and his wives, but I found out that having a certain item you can resurrect these characters at their exact same state they were sacrificed.\n\nIf I had to nitpick, I'd say Agarest is a game where tutorials and documentation could have been done much better. The concept of linked attacks and extended areas is not properly explained, as are not many storywise elements. But the most annoying thing is that in order to lock certain events, or the post-game areas, you will need a guide. If you plan on tackling the post-game area, you must be neutral at certain points. You can also miss events if you take too many turns before reaching them. Although the post-game is primarily used to level up characters and obtaining the best equipments for New Game+, it also explains some of the most crucial story background elements.\n\n\nNow, for the TL;DR section, I'll list the pros and cons.\n\n+ One of the few (if not the only one) JRPG on Steam, so you don't have much choice here if you like the genre.\n+ Japanese voiceovers (most of us consider this a plus)\n+ A long story, even when taking out the tedious battling.\n+ A good soundtrack.\n+ Those titles in the Adventurer's Guild keep you occupied for quite some time.\n+ Multiple wives in each generation, customizing the hero of the next generation. The possibility to marry any (unmarried) girl in the final generation is a big plus.\n\n- Graphics are outdated and look like games on PS1 or PS2.\n- Controls are not really user-friendly if using keyboard / mouse.\n- A repetive soundtrack.\n- Repetive slow battles, unless you play in windowed mode and have edited the Agarest.ini file.\n- Excessive level grinding, especially post-game.\n- Need to use guide to reach mentioned post-game.\n\nMy score for the game is something between 85 / 100 and 90 / 100. It's not perfect, but it's not that bad either.","November 26, 2013","true","242.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You're going to get a ton of hours out of it, which means your time/money ratio is going to be pretty good. However, the combat becomes repetitive, and it can become tedious at times. Personally I had to drop it for a while, then come back and play some more a few months later. The crafting in this game is ridiculous, and not in a good way. It becomes very complicated to make basic items, and you’re often either stuck grinding for pieces, or getting creamed in battle later on, not to mention that the game doesn’t do a good job of explaining how exactly the crafting/upgrading works. Crafting is, by far, the worst part of this game, second place going to repetitive combat.\nNow that the bad is out of the way, there are definitely redeeming aspects to this game. The art is done anime-esque, but it’s done well, and all of the characters look very unique. The backstory itself is pretty basic, (hero, destiny, destroy evil) but the game really puts an interesting spin on it by making it multi-generational. The cast itself is also diverse, and much of the story is character driven over plot driven, and you see characters develop, especially each of the three women for each generation, the more you interact with them and progress. While on the subject of the women, yes, there are some ecchi moments, but it is nowhere near overwhelming or abundant, so don’t let that dissuade you in your choice to purchase it. The combat, while repetitive, can also be fun. The goal to break enemies, get higher combos to earn more TP, and do massive damage to gain titles, adds a fun side aspect to the fight. Also, combos are pretty cool, as you can combine moves together to make more powerful moves, and some of them just look awesome, though after you do it 50 times, the wonder starts to wear off. However, this does encourage you to use more than just your same five characters, so you can expound upon your combos.\nAll in all, while not perfect, I think this game is for sure worth the buy. As it stands, I’m really enjoying myself, even if I do need to take another break soon. The replay value is also high, as there are choices you can make story wise, and with the women (which transverses into the stats and weapons of your next generation hero, and not just how they look.)\nI would also recommend using the DLC that comes with it on your first play through, so you can really figure out what you’re doing, though that’s totally up to you.\nRank: 7.5/10","April 14, 2014","true","29.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's no real challenge, or thought out strategy for building up your character into a complete bad-♥♥♥. You start off a bad-♥♥♥, and I'm not sure that's really such a good thing. I like the slow buildup, being challenged along the way, and culminating into an epic battle to finish off the game.

The battles are all usually the same except for occasional variety, the story line (Dialogue I meant) is pathetic, the relationship gauge is entirely stupid, but the combat itself (if you get used to repetition) is quite entertaining. It encourages strategic thinking and placement and if you make a mistake, its repricussions are usually dire. I have not played this game on easy or normal mode, just skipped those and went straight to hard mode because man mode. The DLC weapons and items are 100% a waste of money unless one wants to breeze through the whole game, and using only silver weapons for a good amout of Generation ONE is so frustratingly challenging(Silver Sword trick gives lots of them :|). If you want a challenge and do not mind the same format of battle for over 1000 little skirmishes (by the way 1000 is probably not even close to how many of these there are. More I'd guess) while constantly having the enemy get stronger and stronger then this game is definitely for you.\n\nNOTE: THE DAMN EVENTS ARE A HUGE PAIN. SAVE OFTEN ON HARD.

If you just want to see my score and pros / cons of this game, skip to the end.\n\nAgarest: Generations of War is a tactical JRPG (Japanese Role Playing Game). Being a JRPG, you should be prepared for severe grinding at times, especially if playing in highest difficulty level. The free DLC that come with the game can ease up the beginning, but the gear won't last through the whole game and there is little you can do about it but grind for levels and better gear. On the third generation, things start getting tougher. Having ignored some of the game mechanics during the first two generations, depending on my superior equipment and characters who continue with you between generations, I was stuttered when I was thrown in a game-over-hell nearing the end of third generation.\n\nThe story begins when a young man, Leonhardt, leads a small unit to conquer more land for his king. Leonhardt wonders if he is doing the right thing and betrays his king when he saves a young elf girl from his own men. A dark knight arrives, mortally wounding Leonhardt, but not finishing him off. Before he passes away, Leonhardt is visited by a mysterious woman who saves his life and grants him the power to fight against the darkness, but at a price: he must eventually sacrifice himself as a "Spirit Vessel" to seal the great pillar in the land, and his descendants are destined to the same fate.\n\nWhich brings me to the next point: generations. Each generation consists of a single continent with multiple dungeons and goals to accomplish. During your journeys, you will meet several women who are destined to end up as your soul mates. By initiating events on the world map, the affections of these women towards your hero will change. At the end of each generation, you will be able to marry one of the girls you meet, but only if she cares much about you.\n\nSince you are required to sacrifice yourself in order to seal the pillar at the end, your hero won't continue to the next generation. Each generation follows the same principle: You will have a boy, your hero and all wife candidates sacrifice themselves and the rest of the party travels to the next continent. The next generation starts as your child approaches adulthood. At first I was put off by the fact you lose your hero and his wives, but I found out that having a certain item you can resurrect these characters at their exact same state they were sacrificed.\n\nIf I had to nitpick, I'd say Agarest is a game where tutorials and documentation could have been done much better. The concept of linked attacks and extended areas is not properly explained, as are not many storywise elements. But the most annoying thing is that in order to lock certain events, or the post-game areas, you will need a guide. If you plan on tackling the post-game area, you must be neutral at certain points. You can also miss events if you take too many turns before reaching them. Although the post-game is primarily used to level up characters and obtaining the best equipments for New Game+, it also explains some of the most crucial story background elements.\n\n\nNow, for the TL;DR section, I'll list the pros and cons.\n\n+ One of the few (if not the only one) JRPG on Steam, so you don't have much choice here if you like the genre.\n+ Japanese voiceovers (most of us consider this a plus)\n+ A long story, even when taking out the tedious battling.\n+ A good soundtrack.\n+ Those titles in the Adventurer's Guild keep you occupied for quite some time.\n+ Multiple wives in each generation, customizing the hero of the next generation. The possibility to marry any (unmarried) girl in the final generation is a big plus.\n\n- Graphics are outdated and look like games on PS1 or PS2.\n- Controls are not really user-friendly if using keyboard / mouse.\n- A repetive soundtrack.\n- Repetive slow battles, unless you play in windowed mode and have edited the Agarest.ini file.\n- Excessive level grinding, especially post-game.\n- Need to use guide to reach mentioned post-game.\n\nMy score for the game is something between 85 / 100 and 90 / 100. It's not perfect, but it's not that bad either.","November 26, 2013","true","242.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You're going to get a ton of hours out of it, which means your time/money ratio is going to be pretty good. However, the combat becomes repetitive, and it can become tedious at times. Personally I had to drop it for a while, then come back and play some more a few months later. The crafting in this game is ridiculous, and not in a good way. It becomes very complicated to make basic items, and you’re often either stuck grinding for pieces, or getting creamed in battle later on, not to mention that the game doesn’t do a good job of explaining how exactly the crafting/upgrading works. Crafting is, by far, the worst part of this game, second place going to repetitive combat.\nNow that the bad is out of the way, there are definitely redeeming aspects to this game. The art is done anime-esque, but it’s done well, and all of the characters look very unique.

The cast itself is also diverse, and much of the story is character driven over plot driven, and you see characters develop, especially each of the three women for each generation, the more you interact with them and progress.

While I was expecting an experience similar to Vandal Hearts, the battle system in this is actually quite different due to combos and lack of counter attacks. While I'm starting to catch on to the combo system, I've discovered you don't necessarily want to move your characters in direct confrontation with the enemies. Instead, you should link them (look for a glowing arc between their heads), overkill the first enemy, and all of your players will all move during this combo to a formation that better favors a follow up attack on subsequent enemies. Although the special effects are awesome, the battles get repetative and even in the premium edition, the battle field is the same grid with few variations in background (usually just the same forest). Also, the equipment included in the additional packs included with the base game make every battle (at least in the beginning of the game) pointlessly easy and unchalleging. The plot isn't entirely original but is well thought out enough to keep the game interesting. There's no actual animation of the characters, just a few different still stances with interchangable facial expressions similar to the animation style in Sakura Spirit. At least the images are crisp, well drawn, and hi-res. The sound fits well with the game. Overall, I would give it an 7.5/10 and only recommend it if you're a die-hard fan of these types of games and it's on sale.","March 27, 2015","true","35.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Played games like these during my childhood and frankly helped me rekindle old times. I originally played this on the Xbox 360 and Ps3 console versions before switching over here. I always loved how we get the choices in every dating sim and the heroines. The choices we have and the usual fun we have with the service in it. What I loved about this game was the endings and the choices for the kids. This game reminded me when I first picked it up a little bit on par to some of Star Ocean, Growlanser, Ar Tonelico, and many other RPGs I've played that included an ending and possible romance route. What I enjoyed quite greatly was the fact that we have in here the grid system in which has been used before like in disgaea. Obviously the link system was a nice mix when combining moves. I remember spending hours rushing through the other areas and taking one route to see all different approaches to it and multiple saves. What I truly enjoyed this game was as usual the new game+ mode where it transfers over. Having the ability to capture monsters with merciful strike also helped and fusing them. Ah I cannot wait to see more from this series. I love it when they make quite the grand appeal. I obviously love many things but wiith great enthusiasm and experience from both consoles LIMITED Edition as well as the ones after this one, that it is worth the buy. You gotta put some time into it but the fact you have auto battle helps it out but don't forget you still gotta click over it's not like a speed through for those who usually think I will just have them auto level. The weapons you make and accessories have extra moves and the fact that you can use some of those moves to help your character with it's abilities although it is tedious like using a fire element skill multiple times just to upgrade one state. However I must state that as usual for the fun and love of Winfield! HOT SPRINGS/Onsen!

I think there should be more explanation on how the game works.\n\nAside from that, some battles can be quite annoying because of the difficulty spikes, especially when you reach generation 3, where enemies suddenly start to evade all you attacks and deal more damage.\n\nThe story and characters are interesting and there's also many differents paths you can follow.\n\nI would recommend this game to the hardcore jrpg fans and people with lots of free time on their hands, since this one can be quite tricky at times, even on the easy difficulty level.\n\nAlthough this game is not my favorite, I'm happy they decided to bring the whole series to pc.

While I was expecting an experience similar to Vandal Hearts, the battle system in this is actually quite different due to combos and lack of counter attacks. While I'm starting to catch on to the combo system, I've discovered you don't necessarily want to move your characters in direct confrontation with the enemies. Instead, you should link them (look for a glowing arc between their heads), overkill the first enemy, and all of your players will all move during this combo to a formation that better favors a follow up attack on subsequent enemies. Although the special effects are awesome, the battles get repetative and even in the premium edition, the battle field is the same grid with few variations in background (usually just the same forest). Also, the equipment included in the additional packs included with the base game make every battle (at least in the beginning of the game) pointlessly easy and unchalleging. The plot isn't entirely original but is well thought out enough to keep the game interesting. There's no actual animation of the characters, just a few different still stances with interchangable facial expressions similar to the animation style in Sakura Spirit. At least the images are crisp, well drawn, and hi-res. The sound fits well with the game. Overall, I would give it an 7.5/10 and only recommend it if you're a die-hard fan of these types of games and it's on sale.","March 27, 2015","true","35.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The designers make up for this by giving you plenty to do from crafting to capturing monsters.\n\nIts a nice little title that will give you a lot of hours of replay value should you desire to see the other stories and outcomes.

It is easier than most strategy games once you figure out how to do combined attacks. I just do the same attack every battle and win easily. This is the only game I ever pre-ordered and I bought 1 copy for myself and one for my brother. I thought I was getting a deal since it was discounted and came with the DLC that was advertised to come free with the pre-order as if it wasn't something that every player would get free anyway. The DLC comes with the game anyway and you need to turn it off to have a decent experience with this game. It is way too powerful and I just turned it all off to start with, but they released more and auto-enabled it into my game... Also, don't buy any extra DLC. It is all stuff you get in the game anyway and will make everything too easy. I would definely buy this game for $12. It was still a good buy when i got it for $16 since I had been waiting forever for a tactics style game on the PC. This is similar to FFT, Disgaea, and Fire Emblem. It is just as easy as FFT and Disgeae but more repetitive than both with every battle being almost the same. Some great features that make this game much more playable than those other games are the option to skip animations and a setting in the ini file to speed the game up as fast as you want. I like how they keep changing your main character as you go through the chapters so you get to play lots of characters. There are some that you get to keep and you can bring the old ones back if you want, but it is nice not just having one main character that you play the whole game. I found the story to be pretty funny so far. ALL of the female images in the game are sugestive, but if you unlock the CG images, you will find that they are pretty hilarious although I'm sure they were intended to be sexy. Could just be my humor. Don't expect a serious story and you'll have a great time with this game.","November 25, 2013","true","793.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's not the best jrpg but there are few options on PC (at least legally), this game is one of those options.   The game has a surprising amount of content for the price you pay.  The combat is addicting as it is more cerberal than just simple button presses as you must try to find the right positions to link together attacks.   There is a dating sim element in choosing your partner but it is not too risque,  it shows  less than games such as Dragon Age or Mass Effect.   Yes there is a ton of expensive dlc, but they are only optional weapon or item upgrades, not content required to get the full experience of the game.\nIf you are comparing this game to classics like FFT, Front Mission, or other strategy-jrpgs, you may be disappointed as Agarest is not trying to be the greatest game ever.  And you know what, that is okay, it satisfies an itch of wanting to play jrpgs on PC, and because of that, it's a pretty decent game.  Nothing special but games don't have to be special to be great.

Go get this game, or you bring such SHAMEFUR DISPLAY to family.\n\nDLC? Not worth it. The base is good enough as it is. The game format is in the Strategy Turn-Based Tile JRPG game. Also, the DLC may NEVER be discounted. As of this review, this thing is on a holiday sale, but NONE of the DLC is discounted, and it's really just getting more points to shave off some grinding. No biggie, please ignore.\n\nVoice acting is alright, it won't win any oscars. But it's not downright horrible. If you're THAT interested in the voiceovers, you can buy the additional voice packs for $9.99. That's the only DLC I'd recommend. The appeal to the story is that you have multiple generations and you can date various people over time. Waifu simulator in a JRPG? Check.\n\nChaining character attacks, overlimits, and combos is crucial to the game's core mechanic. I only wish there would be an option to SPEED it up faster. Since this game is a port of a console, playing it with your 360 or PS3 controller works well here. Mouse and Keyboard is accessible, you can change the bindings as well, which is a positive.\n\nHow does it stand overall?  It's a different take from what you'd get with a game like Disgaea. It gets a bit grindy, but it takes quite some time to get into the bulk of the game, as well as the story. Of course, there's New Game+ and all that jazz, so time is NO issue.\n\nGlorious Nippons and JRPG Strategy Enthusiast, please check this out right away.\nAnyone else? If you're comfortable staring at anime pictures as your avatars and like a different taste of a turn-based strategy game, put it on your back burner.\n\nOtherwise? It's average at most, and it will not definitely catch people's short attention span. It's a niche for what it is. If you're more into the western market and want a thrilling experience within the same genre, go take a look at XCON: Enemy Unknown + Enemy WIthin DLC instead as that's more engaging than this game. But for the very few who want another Strategy JRPG in a buried gem, it's worth at least the 10$, or 11.99$ for a Holiday/Flash Sale.","December 22, 2013","true","1.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

That should tell you alot already. If you're not into that kind of thing, you'd better off strafe right away from this JRPG, as it's visual novel elements are it's strongest point (unlike many of you may think, the battle system is terrible, slow, and boring).\n\nThe gameplay is, I'll say, badly executed. It's a weird kind of strategy game, as your enemies don't move each per turn -- they all move during a single "move phase", denying you of the opportunity of creating strategical scenarios from enemy movements and yours and instead simply dumbing it down to a "rush forward towards the enemy" scenario. Of course, some may say that the partner system makes up for that, but...\n\nIn-battle, the "tag" system is done with a bad interface. You can not see your character's tag up squares -- if you were moving with another one, and forgot where they were, you are forced to re-select the character you want to tag up with and re-check the localization of their tag up square. It's a repetitive, boring and annoying process to do but nevertheless it's necessary until you get the hang of how the tag squares spread themselves on the ba ttlefield.\n\nEnemies feel ridiculously powerful in higher levels of difficulty. Even your strongest attacks using the tag-up system in battle barely seem to do anything to them, making for more slow battles that become a repetitive "attack until get enough sp, use super, heal if needed" fights.\n\nThat aside, the game is a marvelous story. While gameplay is it's weakpoint, plot is it's absolutely strong point: very well written, interesting characters, amazing generation system, marriage system, karma system, which all add to the replayability and branch the story into multiple routes. Lots of them.\n\nThe game's visuals are beautiful. The sprites are well done; the animations are nice to see; the CGs are high-quality and extremely attractive, being displayed in a high resolution. The soundtrack is entirely entrancing, especially during battles, which actually allows you to throw aside it's terrible gameplay simply because of those visual and sound elements: they're that good.\n\nAll in all, as I said, the game should, unfortunately, not be played as a game. It should be played as a Visual Novel with gamepaly elements, giving your focus into the story and character devolpment over the metagame.

Once you've gotten your head around the tile system, combat becomes pretty easy and more of a chore.\n\nThe combat animation is a nice sprite based one, but the character cutouts standing around in the scenes aren't great.\n\nAnd the talking scenes, drag on forever plus they're terribly translated. It's very obviously japanese. The story is a cliché but not a bad one, and I could live with it if the characters were more interesting. Which they aren't. You've seen these guys before and better.\n\nAll in all I just found it boring and unfulfilling and after reaching generation 2 of 5 after 20 hours of stale gameplay and tedious item micromanagement I just plain didn't want to play this game.\n\nI've seen other games do the same thing better, I've seen games turn around after a long time and become good, and I think I gave this the benefit of the doubt.","February 4, 2014","false","20.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

The story is great and the setting is original. The only other game that has a story  almost as unique as this one is Star Ocean.\n\nCharacters archtypes are the usual and typical kind, but it doesn't make the game any less fun.\n\nIts battle style is nothing that I have ever encountered before. Movement and character placement is almost like a game of chess, requiring strategy during movement and battles with your pieces having a preset placement, and knowing your pieces' abilities when attacking can be beneficial to taking out the enemy. If you enjoy chess you'll enjoy this game.\n\nI preordered the game and got all the DLC free. As the frist game that I have ever gotten DLC for (in the beginning of the game), and I find it to break the game. It makes it absolutely no fun. I had to turn it off to enjoy the adventure part. Running through a game completely invincible is next to pointless unless its after you completed the game.

It's not the best jrpg but there are few options on PC (at least legally), this game is one of those options.   The game has a surprising amount of content for the price you pay.  The combat is addicting as it is more cerberal than just simple button presses as you must try to find the right positions to link together attacks.   There is a dating sim element in choosing your partner but it is not too risque,  it shows  less than games such as Dragon Age or Mass Effect.   Yes there is a ton of expensive dlc, but they are only optional weapon or item upgrades, not content required to get the full experience of the game.\nIf you are comparing this game to classics like FFT, Front Mission, or other strategy-jrpgs, you may be disappointed as Agarest is not trying to be the greatest game ever.  And you know what, that is okay, it satisfies an itch of wanting to play jrpgs on PC, and because of that, it's a pretty decent game.  Nothing special but games don't have to be special to be great.

I for one enjoy games that give me at 10+ hours at the very least. So this game was a great pickup at the price.\n\nThe way I felt when playing through this went from "It's pretty fun" to "I can't wait to play this tomorrow", then to "I want to beat this" at the end. The middle section (mid gen 2 to mid gen 4) was the most fun for me because there were so many new combos that could actually be done. Whereas in the first generation, you were more or less limited to less than 15.\nAs you can see, the combat system is played on a board where you move and then prepare your attacks. The fights fluxuate between average difficulty that you can still lose if you're careless on most fights and boss fights that take several tries if you're underleveled. Unless you grind to be 10+ levels higher than the enemies, there will always be some sort of challenge in battles.\n\nWith hundreds of weapons, a giant pool of titles to achieve, some really cool looking combination attacks and several endings, replayability is written all over Agarest. The OST doesn't yell "I NEED THIS SOUNDTRACK!!!", but it's still nice to listen to. Even if you never finish this game, you're more than likely to get more out of Agarest than what you paid.","June 11, 2014","true","116.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have also only completed the second generation as of the time of review, I usually write reviews after i'm done with the game but I felt like I had to get this off my chest.\n\nStoryline The main storyline for this game isn't the most interesting one. Its about a person and his decendants becoming a medium to seal off the forces of darkness. The more interesting bit of the story comes from the individual stories told by the heroes in every generation, in another words there should be 5 stories to play through since i believe there are 5 generations of heroes to play. So far in the first and second generation, the beginning wasn't very interesting since nothing much happens, but when complications in the story arises, it becomes more enjoyable to read and play. My biggest complaint about the story is that it seems certain 'events' can only be triggered when you follow the 'true ending', which is difficult to achieve without a walkthrough. I hope that in Agarest: Generations of War 2, all of the 'events' will be readily available as the story progresses.\n\nGameplayAs a complete newbie in JRPGs, Agarest lacks of help features that can really make a person quit after an hour. The mechanics of the game is more complicated than MMOs whereby setting up combos is required to win the game. While the tutorial is helpful in explaining the mechanics and only teaches you what you need to know at that time, there is a lack of help or FAQ to refer to anytime in game in case of any doubts. Due to that, after taking a long break from the game, I struggled on the mechanics of the game for awhile before getting the hang of it.\n\nAnother personal issue that I had with this game is the fact that it is too long, there are cases where I had to fight through up to 4-5 stages of monsters before i can trigger another 'event'. This makes the game feel very tiring because alot of time needs to be spent before the story can progress. I really hope that future generations and Agarest: Generations of war 2 will have shorter stages in between 'events' to make the game less tiring to play.\n\nOn the plus side, because the game is abit hard, it really calls for proper strategic plays to win and minimise losses and that is something I enjoy. The skills in the game is also very flashy which I like as well although it would be nice to have a 'normal' attack so that I could save ap for future use and not waste it on a 50hp enemy.\n\nConclusion\nPeople who are new to this genre might want to stay away from this game and try something else first to get a good gist on how a JRPG feels like. Those who already played JRPGs before should definitely try this game out. In my opinion the price tag of $15 is already enough to keep you playing for at least a month or so.","April 16, 2015","true","178.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Combat with a new approach through the linking system allowing slower teammates to link up with faster teammates in order to perform their attacks or combination attacks quicker.\n\nDuring the adventure from each generation, your character will be able to build relationship with 3 different female characters through selections of responses. At the end of the generation, if they have positive affection towards you, you can choose one of the 3 to be your wife. Your son's stats will be different depending who you choose and he will continue the story in the next generation. Old teammates from previous generation will also return to aid you in the new adventure.\n\nSo far some of the flaws is the crafting system, which some of the materials requires you to overkill certain enemies in order to get and if you missed a key enemies that cannot be fought in the current generation then that is it. Combats can get repetitive after a while since you are basically tasked to fight until the next diaglog or an event.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeurnoire/recommended/237890/","Coeurnoire","Black Heart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeurnoire/","494 products in account","So, I've been trying to think of a way to review this that doesn't start with that I feel like an idiot.\n\nLook what happened there! :D\n\nBut seriously. The first time I saw this was on the PlayStation Store, and after some reading and seeing the 360's Really Naughty Limited Edition, I kind of laughed it off and went on my way. I missed out. Thankfully, it's come to the Steam store for PC! :D And I have had the opportunity to play it at significantly less than the asking price for the consoles.\n\nThe story isn't a shining example of originality, but it gets the job done and it has some laughs to keep you smiling given you subscribe to this game's type of humour. You are Leonhardt, a former general of the Gridamas army and you sell your soul and the soul of your son, grandson, great grandson and great great grandson in exchange for life and the power to defeat the evil sweeping the land! So the game has strategy gameplay AND a dating sim, as at the end of each generation you will need to choose a bride with which to produce the next generation's hero. The strengths of that future hero are dependent on which bride you chose and your affection level with her.\n\nThe gameplay itself, is pretty standard for a turn based strategy RPG, which is both good and bad. The good is that it isn't particularly esoteric as some strategy games tend to be. You needn't read the internet or page through a thick manual to be able to play this. You can pick it up and be on your way in about 15 minutes of tutorials if you read fast. It uses the standard five core stats, with resistances and so on. If you've played almost any RPG before this, there are no surprises here.\n\nThe BAD is that the combat has nothing that really makes it uniquely Agarest, and it almost never seems to deviate from the same formula. Most battles can be approached by making the same set of actions to get the exact same extension squares from one battle to the next, and I have done so quite successfully in the First Generation. So, the combat can get a bit repetative but for those that don't mind grinding, that isn't a big deal.\n\nThe art is kind of questionable. More effort was put into the environments and the drawings used for conversations than into game character sprites. I feel like so much more could have been done to enhance the characters' visual identity and they just... didn't. That being said, the environents are beautifully detailed on the PC and the manga style art for the conversations is beautiful and entertaining to watch. The dialogue can often be quite funny, too!\n\nOverall, I'd give this a 7/10. It is definitely worth the dollar amount in entertainment value.","April 18, 2014","true","82.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Auto battle is worthless unless you are uber leveled, The AI piles all of your characters' attacks on one enemy, and is super inefficient.

Just saying. HOWEVER, Agarest deserves my review, even if my critique skills are poor.\nIf you read this, please read it through. :3\n\nWhat even is this game?\nAgarest: Generations of War is a turn-based RPG, using a system of tiles as a playing field, where your characters can move and attack opposing enemies. Simple, right? Kind of. (we'll get into that later). But, for now, realize that this game is a turn-based RPG with a visual-novel story-telling method and a TON of stats to consider. (which I love).\n\nStory\nThe story in this game is interesting. I like it because of it's simplicity, yet there are mysteries to solve (if you pay attention) and lore to uncover. It takes place in a magical land where Humans and other various species (like Elves) are at war. There is a backstory about light and dark, and dark lords and such, but you read that in the beginning of the game, so you can do that.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad story. However, since I haven't finished the game, I cannot give a complete answer. Howver so far it takes my interest.\n\nCharacters\nEach character in this game is unique in their own ways (which is a must for RPG's, and any game for that matter). So far, I feel no "emotional" attatchment to any of them, and I honestly don't think I ever will. This isn't "bad", but to some it's undesirable. To me, all that matters is character interaction, personality, how they play in the story, their lore, and their designs. All of these are present in the game.\n\nBattle System\nI'll explain in short: you move your characters to the desired spaces (calle the Move Phase), and make them face directions.  Directions matter . Depending on their direction, certain characters can couple and attack WITH the character you move. Every character has move sets specific to them, their weapon, and their armor piece (forgot the name). Each move has an element, number of hits, range and AP cost (you regain after each cycle). So, switching weapons not only changes your stats, but it also changes your moveset with different elements. The Arts abilities are combonations of attacks, in which characters MUST be coupled. Special Arts are combos of Arts. (So you can see how much variety there can be).\nThis is personal, but I LOVE stat-heavy games such as this. Some people don't, but for me it adds a nice strategy element,\nYou would have to play the game to understand how AP and SP works, and how the battle system works. Because, in reality  this is the whole game . (With the exception of exploring areas and towns, which contain Blacksmiths, Item Shops, etc).\n\nPros\nGreat Art\nInteresting Battle System\nPar story\nHUGE amount of gameplay hours\nStory decisions\nInteresting Generation system *\nFun to play\nCons  Repetitive at times\nPremium upgrade makes beginning easy as HECK\nOther little nit-picks (like how towns are not free roaming)\n*Depending on who you marry (out of 3 girls), the next generation will have differing stats, a unique and cool feature.\n\nConclusion\nI bought all three games for $17.99 on the winter sale, and I am not dissapointed. I love the fan-base, and love the game. Cannot wait to get farther into it, and to start the other two games.\n\nHonestly, they are great and this game is the perfect starter to the series (even if Agarest Zero is the prequel). So,if you're wondering "Should I buy it? It looks kinda cool" then don't hesitate. Just get it. If your a fan of these kind of games, you won't be dissapointed.\n\nEND OF REVIEW :)","February 4","true","14.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Agarest you can say is kind of a strategy rpg but not as much as per say fire emblem but its combat sort of like a small srpg. the combat is very fun as there are massive link attacks and combinations you can do. your attacks are based on AP which you gain more of each turn the more AP a party member has the more attacks he/she can do. the point in the game im at right now the battles reqiure thinking if you want to keep all your party members alive but i do reccomend playing on normal first cause you dont want it too easy.  the story is on a alright pace right now but the characters are great the game has some pretty good writing and likable characters so the story will probably not be amazing at the jump but the good writing and cool characters are well edition in your journey. i love this game so far i think valve made a good choice going after this game. it may not be a final fantasy tales or shin megami tensei but hell this game is on or surpasses some of the games in those franchises. i deffinently reccomend this game to any rpg lover. lets support this and get the other agarest games on steam as well. awsome game pick it up","December 27, 2013","true","42.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The story is engaging, the voice acting (though in Japanese with English subs) is great, the gameplay is well-polished and interesting. And the whole "5 generations of parties spanning 100+ years" adds a very nice mechanical and story element.\n\nWhen you near the end of the current generation's gameplay, you go and marry one of your female party members (with 3 choices), and their affection towards you determines the stats of your child. And for battles, you don't have a normal "attack" option, you always use skills. And you can combine Skills (with party members too if they are standing in one of your link areas) into more powerful combos. You can even combine ultimates (and every character has 3). Wish you had your previous generation hero with all the stats and upgrades you put on him? You can bring him into your party as a "Marionette" (for a hefty price). You can also capture monsters (who have their own skill list) and use them in your party as well. Monsters drop items, but if you manage to Overkill them, you get another, rarer item. There is also an equipment upgrade system available.\n\nI would definitely recommend grabbing the game, and it comes free with the critical DLC (mainly the extra dungeons). However, I would suggest turning the DLC off for your first playthrough, since they give some fairly powerful weapons early on (as in I was one shotting pretty much everything up to level 10 or so) so you can get the full experience. I would stay away from buying the extra DLC, as it's just weapon and stat upgrades for the most part.\n\nTL,DR: Get this game! But don't get the DLC until at least one playthrough.","December 29, 2013","true","1.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It probably has nothing you haven't seen done before in the 6 years that it's been out. If you're really into JRPGs or on a quest to marry as many imaginary elves as possible in your lifetime, you'll probably want to check this game out.\n\nJRPG is a genre that generally relies heavily on clichés and Agarest: Generations of War is no exception; the game is set in a standard Japanese fantasy setting with obligatory elves and you are the chosen one, destined to save the world! If you can't stand cheesy fiction, then stay far away from this title; it is one of the 5 legendary cheese generals of the legendary cheese army of legend.\n\nThe gameplay consist mainly of 3 things:\n1. The overworld map where you walk from place to place and visit towns where you can upgrade equipment/trade/craft items/etc.\n2. The visual novel style story segments.\n3. The main meat of the game, the battle system. Battles are played out on a gridbased plane. The key part of the gameplay is linking together characters(if characters stand in certain spots relative to their teammates position, they become linked) thus enabling them to attack at the same time and do combo attacks. Part of the charm of JRPGs is to watch ridiculous super-attacks play out.\n\nNow, there are a few things I found unique about this game. (!!NOT REALLY SPOILERS, YOU GET TO KNOW THIS AFTER THE FIRST FIGHT!!) The way the story plays out is that you die, and have the option to be ressurected, but only in exchange for devoting your life, and the lives of your children, to defeating the great evil that's coming. "Generations of War". A threat too powerful for one single generation to beat? Cool.\n\nYou should know that the game is spoken entirely in Japanese. I love it, but there's a lot people who dislike it being in Japanese only, so I feel this is an important point to bring up.\n\nNow I don't care about this personally,  but I know that there's a lot of discussion going on about gender issues  right now and that there are a lot of people who do care about that(I do too, just not in this case). Chances are that you've looked at the community hub of this game and seen a bunch pictures of young girls(it's ok, because elves) in wedding dresses and naked under bed sheets.\n\nYes, this game takes some cues from dating sims. Every generation you choose one out of 3 women to be your spouse. Your child will then become the main character of the next generation. You pick different choices that makes different women favor you more/less and depending on those choices, one of them becomes your wife at the end of the generation and you get to see her in a wedding dress and under a bed sheet. It's all very tame, really.\n\nStory-wise, the relationships feel forced. At one point in the first generation, all the women gather around you to tell you how much they suddenly want you. There was not really any build up for that or at least not enough. As I said, this is a cheesy, clichéd story.\n\nThe game is slow. It takes a lot of time to get through fights, especially on hard. The game really is grindy. It's also long, though I like that. I'm at 70 hours in and I haven't finished the second generation yet. There's 5 generations to my knowledge. You CAN disable all animations and it will make battles finish much faster, but watching over-the-top attacks is part of the experience with JRPGs. I really wish there was an option to just speed the game up.\n\nThere's a lot of DLC for this game. All of it makes the game easier, except the DLC that unlocks voices and the gallery  instead of unlocking them through just playing. My problem with DLC is that it feels like I don't own the complete game, not that it makes me overpowered. Hopefully they'll release a bundle in the future(without the unlocks).","November 25, 2013","true","81.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

However it is the battle system that is used that largely hinders the game. Comboing is repetative and tedious and requires you to position your characters in ways that often compromises tactics, occasionally you'll have to turn your back to an enemy just to link with a character.\n\nAnother issue out of battle is the grind, everything in this game is crafted or gotten from drops. The shops are pretty much useless because until you craft something the shops won't stock it. This goes for skills, weapons, etc. There is a monster raising aspect to the game aswel but the battles are far too boring to want to catch monsters. I find myself only able to play this game in short bursts and after 10 hours started using the DLC gear just to speed up the agonizing process.\n\nThe story is relatively bland although I find it and the generations system the only real thing that kept me playing this game. The dialogue is often completely terrible and the background scenery is recycled countless times even when on different continents. Additionally there are next to cinematics in this game except the occasional "bedroom" scene which is little less than fanservice.\n\nIn sum I reccomend you NOT play this game even if you enjoy the genre this game is not a good port.","July 18, 2014","false","18.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The story is cliche and the the gameplay is entirely too repetitive. It's nothing more than the same battle after battle. And the story isn't interesting enough to feel like a reward. I've tried playing this on console and PC. I tried again on PC solely because it was on sale with booster packs, so I thought maybe I could get through the game without the grindfest. But now I remember why I dropped the game in the first place. It wasn't that it was a grindfest. It was because the story was not engaging, nor was the gameplay. No doubt, the battle mechanics are interesting with how duel attacks and special attacks are forged between various characters on the board. But at the end of the day, I really think the fact that ALL battle boards are FLAT with NO terrain variation kills the game. Final Fantasy Tactics in 1998 had terrain variation. This game from the 21st century does not. Perhaps if it was on NES I could excuse it.

I kept wanting to go back but couldn't stand more than one or two fights before giving up and moving on.\n\nIt uses a grid movement system on top of regular combat necessitating battle formations and allowing characters to move earlier if they're in certain position in relation to each other, which may not sound all that bad, but after a while it just turns into a dull slog of move-organise attacks-move. A classic battle set-up with each team staying on opposite sides of a field would have been bearable but splicing chess into it just kills the pacing.\n\nOh sure, it's fun to see my guys team up on some poor monster and execute an over-the-top attack combo dealing twice it's health in damage, but that would still be present if they'd gone for a traditional battlefield setup. And the paths you follow force you to go through so many battles between each story part, meaning you can't avoid it.\n\nI don't normally mind if a game has a rather slow pace. In the past I've spent 80+ hours on single play-throughs of Dragon Age, but unavoidable, brow-beatingly dull combat made it seem more like a job than a game. Hell, there's enough story here to just make it a visual novel and scrap the combat completely.\n\nWhile I would have liked to see it through to completion, I've sadly put it in my Ignored list simply because I couldn't find the enthusiasim to keep dragging on have since moved to more engaging titles.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reviilagoon/recommended/237890/","reviilagoon","Revii Lagoon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reviilagoon/","373 products in account","First and foremost, this is very much a niche game, it is not for everyone. What really drew me in to playing so much of the game, doing two playthroughs, was the combat system. At it's core, Agarest GoW is a tactical turn based strategy RPG, and it does that very well. Combat is interesting, complex, and full of depth. It isn't perfect though, each battle can last for several minutes due to a few factors. First being archaic pre-determined load times of battles, you can have GoW on a SSD, have it load in miliseconds, yet all the battles take 30 seconds to load the enemies and players. Combat animations can be skipped, which helps, but it still doesn't speed up the process of setting up your attacks, which is fun, but time consuming.\n\nStory wise, GoW has a great, and very long main story. With any of the DLC weapons to get through the early generations quickly, you are looking at a 125+ hour story, and without them, it could easly be 150+ hours, before you get to the final boss. The story is an epic tale of a world slowly being consumed by darkness, and you fight, literally for over 100 years, to save the world, which is slowly being taken over by demon armies. Most of the characters are very interesting, and have their own unique personalities and motivations. You really do get a feeling that you know who a character is, and why they are there, it just might take some time to flesh out a character. Oh, and there are a lot of playable characters, 30+ in fact, from all the generations, not including nearly every enemy in the game which can be turned into a party member if you choose to do so. You really do have a large variety of characters and skill sets to choose from, and each generation change always forces you to change up your party members and play style in some way.\n\nOne other issue I had was that in order to get the most out of seeing all the events and experiencing the game, you need to play through the perfect path. Pre-post game stuff, as well as the full post game doesn't even unlock unless you follow a very specific set path of choices throughout the game. If you want the most out of the game, you really do need to follow a perfect path guide.\n\nWhat made me kept playing was simply how much fun the combat was, up until post-game, the combat was very diverse and interesting. Post-game however really devolves into a cheese fest where you use the cheeziest stratigies in order to beat bosses. Who would think you can kill gods, dragons, demons, devils, and all sorts of mythical creatures using grass as your primary weapon.\n\nOne last note about the DLC, the weapons are powerful, some of which are nearly as powerful as the strongest weapons in the game. They really do save a lot of time though, because let's face it, there is a lot of grinding for things. Even with powerful weapons, in generation 3 and beyond you can easily die to bosses if you aren't careful.\n\nIf you are a fan of Strategy RPG's, love a good story, and don't mind putting 125+ hours into a game, Agarest Generations of War is for you.","March 7, 2015","true","198.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, as much of a final fantasy and turn based strat game lover I am, the FF Tactics like graphics/gameplay turned me away. The biggest mistake I believe I made honestly.\n\nSince purchasing this game, I have been immersed in the story, the dating sim, and combat of this game. The gameplay seems to be quite continuous, which I enjoy that the only slowness from the games comes from me stopping to go over status, items and the like. The music is really good, in my opinion as well. I'm thrilled with most of the music in this game.\n\nAside from the graphics being outdated, the gameplay itself rivals Fire emblem and aside from the lack of an in depth tutorial or information menu, the game seemingly welcomes new players. I've been playing on Normal with only a few roadblocks stopping me in the beginning with strategies and the like getting me killed.

It's got stratagy for those who love stratagy. It's got a dating sim for those who love to pillage the fertile land of women, and then it's got REPLAYABILITY like no other game I've ever seen.\n\nLet me stress the most important part of this game; it's replayability.\nIt has 99 save slots for a reason. USE THEM, or you will be restarting all over constantly.\n(Of course, the First generation isn't that bad as I can speed rush it in around 3 hours on hard, without any of those OP DLC)\nBecause of the dating simulation part of this game, it makes you, like PHYSICALLY MAKES YOU, retry over and over to get the woman you want. Of course, this isn't just preference. The woman you pick each generation has a lasting effect through the entire game, making it extremely crucial to save a lot. As some women will give you the weapons and stats you want, as others will not. It depends on how you play the game though, and want to.\nLuckily, the first generation is pretty set-in-stone in terms of who you marry and what your son will be like, but after that, your decisions and how you play the game affect their stats even more drastically. They could be a mage who likes to use daggers, or a pathetically low-health ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who can't do anything worth a damn.\nThis game also has a nice sneak-preview feature that allows you to see how the women your courting will affect your son, so you can manipulate it to an extent.\nAnd if you mess up, you have to start over. All. Over. Again.\n\nThat's just the DATING SIM part of it, which is actually a lot of this game, but meh.\n\nThe replayability comes as an offset of the Dating Sim, as you have to replay this game Quite a Bit to have all the sons and all of their possible stat outcomes, along with all the possible lineage. Around a lot of times, if I did my math right.\n\nAlso the story is pretty interesting, I mean, who wouldn't want to be part of a Four-some every generation? I mean, come on, insta "TAKE MY MONEY" game.\n\nThis game also comes with a lot of DLC, to either beef up your characters, fill your choffers with gold, or upgrade dem stats and weapons.\n\nAlso, as a pro-tip, I would suggest hitting the Right-mouse button, or backspace to jump. Just a pro-tip.\n\nAnother pro-tip is turn off Battle Effects and movement. (Unless of course you want to see that no "Issen" Ability, and then turn it on, watch the animation, then turn it off again.) Trust me, this will shave HOURS off of your play time, as it speeds the game up sooooooooo much. I can't stress how much it speeds up the game.\n\nFinal rating, 490/500. There are some minor things (like more panty shots, but that's just me) that could be added to the game to make it more interesting, but it's an amazing game, and if you like JRPGs, and SRPGS (stratagy RPGs), or if you like Fire Emblem; Awakening, GET THIS GAME\n\nLIKE RIGHT NOW.\n\nSTOP READING THIS.\n\nThat is all; have a nice day. Have fun pillaging those fertile plains ;)","February 4, 2014","true","70.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fknspz/recommended/237890/","fknspz","Hai Erm Herb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fknspz/","16 products in account","I cannot place this into a yes or no choice. As everyone is subjective in what they think is good or bad, great or terrible. Either way I can only share my thoughts and experiences with the game and nothing more.\n\nLength:\nThe game is long and not because of story reasons. The navigation between place to place is annoying and eventually becomes repeitive and feels almost grindy in the aspect of progressing the story. Sometimes you'll have an event placed on the map while you're progressing that is brief dialogue, sometimes a choice that causes an effect on someones affections. (I will touch up on this later.) So far I've placed almost 30 hours into the game I have yet to finish the second generation story because of the reasons above. I find it more tedious moving across the map fighting almost the same fights over and over.\n\nStory:\nSo far it does well to develop itself at the start but sometimes it feels like it becomes shallow and doesn't do much to progress itself effectively. Sometimes a new character can appear from left field without any warning with a vague explination for their part in the story. In terms of character development it doesn't feel right and some characters don't have any real defining points especially when they feel flat in terms of the heroines, specifically the first generation. The main hero also comes off just as flat and doesn't feel like he can leave a lasting impression. Except for Winfield... the guy just wins so hard that he is my favorite character so far. There is also a light, dark and neutral alignments, and given how far I am, I have yet to see any changes to story.\n\nWithout going into too much detail the game is in five parts, each with its own main hero and set of lovely ladies to marry and have a child with. It has a lot of potential of what you could do with the hero in each generation. The chocies are small at first but once you reach into the third and fourth generations the combinations are MASSIVE. Affection shows you how well your next hero will be as the more they love the hero, the stronger the stats the hero will have going into the next generation. Their weapon, stats, skills and appearence are determined by his mother, grandmother, great grandmother and great, great grandmother.\n\nFor what it is worth there are a lot of profiles and CG pictures you can unlock depending on your in game choices and fullfilling certain requirments. So if you're a completionist better buckle down, grab your cheetoes and Mtn Dew and get cracking.\n\nCombat:\nBroken down into two phases as 'movement phase' and 'combat phase'. At first it feels odd to get used to at first but later becomes easier as you progress. Every action and movement you do is dictated by AP. What AP does for you is provide you with actions in combat for various skills and combination attacks you can do. Moving a space costs one AP. Various magic, healing, and attack spells cost anywhere from 8-24 depending on what it is. During the movement phase who moves is determined by the agility stat. Which honestly isn't that great given its whoever has the most AP in the combat phase that can act first really goes against the stat in terms of affecting turn flow.\n\nEvery player has an extended zone which affects various tiles on the map. Anyone standing on those tiles is linked with that player allowing them to act sooner, join in on combo attacks, and get them out of harms way, or in it if you do some... questionable things like I have.\n\nAdvancement:\nThere are several things you have to do improve your armor, weapons, skills and items. It is dependant on gathering materials, creating the item which then unlocks in the shops for purchase later. Sometimes this can become tedious as you'll have problems getting a monster drop or the creater will goof up and give you something better, which is awesome, or worse, with is a setback depending on what you were making.\n\nThe game also invokes its inner Shin Megami Tensei by letting you capture monsters you encounter on the map and use them to fight, combine or trade them in for items, weapons and armor.\n\nAppearance and Sound:\nThe game for what its worth does look visually georgous to look at and reminds me of Disgaea. Depending on the specs of your computer you can have some slowdown besides the already sluggish feel of the game, which can be fixed by adjusting the FPS to about 40-45 in the folder's .ini.\n\nOverall:\nThe game isn't too bad. Its just steep in terms of what you have to do. While the game can be cleared with almost no equipment, items and stragegy it does test the patience of the player. If you don't mind the slow drudge it places on you from its inate FPS, repetiive combat, tedious map navigations and RNG based monster drop farming this game is for you. If it sounds like a turn off and you're unsure give the game a try.  I give Agarest: Generations of War a 7/10\n\nAt best I can't tell you not to buy this game or stay away and can only provide you what I've encountered with and the problems I've seen with it. If you pick this up use the DLC content that is provided to you from buying the game if yo uwant to experience the game the way it is meant to be. The weapons are really broken and cheese the game too hard.","February 12, 2014","true","31.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I went into this thinking it might be alright but the storyline, gameplay, and even the graphics were all brilliant. Keep in mind I have not completed the game yet but this storyline managed to keep my attention for hours on end with every twist or possible light/dark decision. Unlike most games where saying one thing or another adds a few points to a stat, or maybe makes your character look different. Any light/dark choice made in Agarest can result in major path changes, not to mention how characters will view you in the long run of things. Which means each playthrough can be a unique depending on the choices you make. Aside from the great RPG elements taking a look at the graphics alone makes me go from viewing great anime style portraits for discussions, to looking at well detailed character pieces during battles with full animation. Along with the costumization of which each weapon has it's own unqiue look when used in combat which means not only might you like the stats of a said weapon, it might look really cool in use as well. Even the minor aspects of the game such as adventure were well placed having certain areas which are close to the style of a dungeon crawler. The actual gameplay made sure I never got bored though. When it comes to battle each character is different, and the system is so in depth about how to chain together skills that I actually wanted to read the tutorials so I could pull off some insane combos. The strategy aspect of this game really shines in its combat.\n\nI don't know how this game got such a low metascore, I personally give it a 9/10. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RPGs and strategy, not to mention anyone who enjoys a good storyline.","February 17, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Everything it attempts to do has already been done in a more elegant and satisfying way by other games.\n\nI found the SRPG combat to be boring—boring, that is, unless you forget to turn off the DLC included in the game, which grants you a full set of end-game gear that is so overpowering as to make combat completely trivial. The Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, Disgaea or Super Robot Wars games all offer a much more satisfying experience.\n\nWhile the setup for the plot is good—it's the same that Code Geass had, and that turned out great—the writing is terrible. The main character is shown as a bleeding-heart sentimentalist who deserts from his very first battle and latches hard onto a random elf girl, not just saving her but putting a spur-of-the-moment promise to protect her above his life (hell, above his soul). Every time dialogue scenes came up I had the unpleasant, immersion-breaking feeling of "real people wouldn't say or do this." For a SRPG with good writing pick up the remake of Final Fantasy Tactics for iOS or Disgaea.\n\nYou like the ability to choose your own heroine? Der Langrisser (get it for a SNES emulator) did this back in the 90s along with branching plotlines, tons of different endings, great art and music, and an excellent (and challenging) combat system with class changes.\n\nYou like intergenerational dramas? Fire Emblem did this in the 90s with Genealogy of the Holy War. There's a fan translation patch out that you can enjoy on a SNES emulator. The most current title, Fire Emblem Awakening for the 3DS, absolutely nails this aspect too. If you own a 3DS, for the love of god get Fire Emblem Awakening. If you don't own a 3DS and you are a SRPG fan, you might want to purchase the system just for that game.\n\nThere is just nothing to recommend in Agarest: Generations of War save maybe the art and the music. Seriously, don't get this.","December 12, 2013","false","2.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

In it's native form there were some technical glitches.\n\nOk, so it;s a fairly simple premise:fight lots, kill stuff and save the world. However, the fact that you do this over 5 generations of the same bloodline makes it replayable even before you have finished it. And even when you get there, you may want to go back and do it again to see what you missed.\n\nThis is the beauty of the game-it reminded me of FF7 in that respect. I remember killing the last boss and realising I had a lot more to do. This game is full of little extras like that which keep you hooked. So, the admittedly linear timeline doesn''t detract from the final product. The inclusion of titles (gotta get them all), crafting to make better gear and even skills make for a varied and enjoyable experience.\n\nThis game IS kind of grindy, but only if you want to get everything. The combat is fluid and the combo system works really well. there's a real feeling of satisfaction when you wait for a while building up energy before that final apocalypse when you unleash the fury of the heavens.\n\nSo, the positives are: lots of character customisation, absolutely loads to do, and it certainly delivers on value for money. There are negatives, like the tutorial always playing when you start a new game, the inconvenience of having to fix the FPS lock, but these are minor issues.\n\nIf you want a fighting, crafting, collecting, exploring and story-driven RPG, Agarest could well be for you.","November 29, 2013","true","477.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I kept wanting to go back but couldn't stand more than one or two fights before giving up and moving on.\n\nIt uses a grid movement system on top of regular combat necessitating battle formations and allowing characters to move earlier if they're in certain position in relation to each other, which may not sound all that bad, but after a while it just turns into a dull slog of move-organise attacks-move. A classic battle set-up with each team staying on opposite sides of a field would have been bearable but splicing chess into it just kills the pacing.\n\nOh sure, it's fun to see my guys team up on some poor monster and execute an over-the-top attack combo dealing twice it's health in damage, but that would still be present if they'd gone for a traditional battlefield setup. And the paths you follow force you to go through so many battles between each story part, meaning you can't avoid it.\n\nI don't normally mind if a game has a rather slow pace. In the past I've spent 80+ hours on single play-throughs of Dragon Age, but unavoidable, brow-beatingly dull combat made it seem more like a job than a game. Hell, there's enough story here to just make it a visual novel and scrap the combat completely.\n\nWhile I would have liked to see it through to completion, I've sadly put it in my Ignored list simply because I couldn't find the enthusiasim to keep dragging on have since moved to more engaging titles.

(repetitive, even more so for this kind of game)\n\nAlright now lets get started.\n\nSo, what to say about this game? is it bad? no. Is it good? debatable.\n\nThe concept of agarest is basically dating sim + Srpg and it works pretty well.\nThe story is about a guy who one day goes white knight for this random elf chick, dies or something, gets revived by this other random chick and so on. To put it shortly it is a very generic story, but it is by all means not a bad story, just bland.\n\nOne thing that is very nice is the art. All the characters and backgrounds are drawn very nicely, with nice bright colors everything looks polished and clean. The sprites are very detailed and even some of the bosses are even in 3D, which i thought was a nice touch.\n\n\nThe "morality" system in the game, represented by light and dark, is changed by your decisions made in the game, and this decisions in turn also affect your love interests opinion of you. At the end of each generation you can choose who you get to marry, and get a nice CG of the girl of your choice. ;)\n\nThere is also alot of fan service in this game....god girls in this game don't know how to eat.\n\nThe gameplay, this is where i start to see some rough spots. When i first played this game i was a little dissapointed by the grid like map and how simplistic it felt. unlike similar games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre where the environment actually affects your strategy in a way, like placing your troops on a hill or on top of a building, or rivers and mountains blocking a path etc. Although there are certain grids that give your characters bonuses in Agarest they felt kind of tact on and doesn't really add much to the gameplay. All in all the grid system in agarest isn't a bad system, but compared to other games maps it just  doesn't really feel immersive.\n\nIn conclusion, its not a bad game, the dating sim concept was an intresting idea and the game has a nice presentation, but the meat and bones of the game felt a little bare compared to other games of this genre. Get it if its on sale and you are a fan of srpgs, if your not, i suggest you find better titles of the same genre like tactics ogre because i bet you will stop touching this game within a few hours.\n\n","April 10, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Graphically, the game is awful, the 'battlegrounds' are generic and poorly detailed, as are the characters. There are some nice animation effects in the battle sequences, but you can go as far back as La Pucelle: Tactics or the original Disgaea and find animations that are on or above the level that Agarest is.\n\nAs for the battles themselves, there is nothing 'tactical' nor challenging about them, on the contrary, you can easily stick it on AUTO and allow the AI to faceroll through the game for you, as long as you see to equipment and level-up advancement correctly. Battles are randomly placed through the map and don't appear to serve any purpose other than to fill space or as very poorly thought out story points. Remember Vandal Hearts on the Playstation, where every battle felt pivotal and had purpose? Rarely is the case in Agarest, 90% of the battles feel like a pointless procession and need little tactical thought should you muster the effort to take it off Auto.\n\nThe soundtrack is also lacklustre and repetitive, I've known platform games to have a wider variety of music and sound effects compared to Agarest, perhaps if the game had been developed in the late 90's the soundtrack would've been acceptable, even then it would've been outshone by the likes of the Breath of Fire series, or Grandia.\n\nI think an underlying problem, which has led to the overall shallowness of the game, is that there are so many systems, points, trees and god knows what else going on. The game has no time to focus on any of these features, leading to them being underdeveloped and under-utlised.\n\nI would advise that you avoid this game, the only reason you should consider a purchase is if you're a die hard anime fan needing a fix, or a strategic RPG fan with ABSOLUTELY NOTHING else to play. There are many better games out there that deserve your attention before Agarest does.","May 28, 2014","false","10.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I want to like it. I really, really want to like it. The idea's are nice, the art is nice enough (It's fairly good, if over-reused, sprite art), the music is meh, and the mechanics are fairly easy to grasp. The characters are unique, it's heavy on fan service, and the story tries to draw you in. This game definitely lends itself more to a keyboard and mouse than a controller, so the PC probably actually makes it better.\n\nThe problems with this game are many however. Mainly it lacks focus, there is too much going on, too much to balance, to many things to think about, too many choices with very non obvious results. Reading a wiki about this game made it both *much* easier, and *much more fun* which is a low mark for me. Great RPG's (FFVI, Dragon Age, Kotor, Breath of Fire) were extremely fun to play a few times without a guide, and then more fun to play again later with a guide. This game also has a habit of becoming tedious, repetitive battles with no point, and the grinding, oh the grinding.\n\nBut the worst part, the part that absolutely ruins the game for me is the translation. It is awful. It's terrible. It is so disjointed and unnatural and painful It stops me from playing. I cannot stress enough how much this hurts, especially in a visual novel style game.\n\nIf you buy a few of the OP weapon packs (which I got for pre-ordering) you can skip the endless grinding and put the game on auto, and if you ignore most of the dialogues, and if you read a good walkthrough this game isn't too bad. Still, I can't recommend it.","May 30, 2014","false","7.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's a game, wholly Japanese, through and through, and for that reason, this game is worth it!\nHowever, you do need to have that Anime gene in order to truly enjoy this game. The storyline is overly masculine based, and the combat looks like it should be on an old fashioned 1990s game boy. How this game is a PC game in the 2000s? I'll never comprehend.\n\nThe game itself sports a not very engaging story, which is very slow moving and full of pointless, classic Japanese 'smile and nod' stuff, which was honestly always just a filler tactic to me when the writers ran out of ideas, or didn't know how to get out an awkward dialogue...Smile and nod was a golden rule of thumb for this game, and it made me sad.\n\nThe combat is turn based, and is the only time graphics are added...And if your gaming is fueled by eye candy, then you will want to repeatedly ram this game with the biggest, hardest, most vicious ♥♥♥♥♥ you can possibly buy in Amsterdam...It is GROTESQUE 1990s Gameboy graphics. ~14 graphics are designated to each character, and the game takes place on a checker board style platform. The combat system is RIDICULOUSLY complicated, and takes AGES to learn even the simplest strategy in the game(Luckily the game as an "I'm here for the story, not the combat" option, as well as an 'in between' and "I'm here for the combat, not the story" option to boot, which atleast is a plus)\n\nIf only the story wasn't so disinteresting. The storyline is a cluster**** ♥♥♥♥ of 1 guy in a white trenchcoat protecting girls from danger. That's it, and it honestly gets irritating to watch(I'm a feminist, I LOVED Claymore and Sekirei and Heaven's Lost Property where the WOMEN got to be the powerful ones for a change!)\n\nNow some of you Anime fans are probably already unsheathing your replica katana swords, and loading your Soft gun Van Hellsing handguns with paint bullets etc., but let it be known that I have been a die-hard Anime fan all of my life(I watched Aika when I was 10!). I love Anime, and its a passion of mine, and that's why I got this game, but I had hoped it was less like the average run-of-the-mill Animes, and more of a standalone I-Am-My-Own-Game Anime. But life sometimes gives you lemons.\n\nIn this case though, the lemons gave you lemonade, even just a small glass with too little sugar in it, but still better than none at all: The Steam Background images.\n\nThese Steam background images(You can see one on my profile page), are some of the most expensive, and rare on Steam, some going for a mere $5.00, while the most expensive I've seen went for $60, multiple times the value of the game itself! The cards being expensive to buy, and the backgrounds yielding SO MUCH market value, has led this game's popularity on steam to SKYrocket not because of its quality, but because of the rewards you get for playing it(I blame the partially revealed anime b00bies)\n\nRegardless...I am not going to rate this game based on its Backgrounds on Steam. As a game, this game is not worth playing, so if you are not interested in the backgrounds, and want a good, fun Anime game? I'll not recommend this one.\n\nHowever, as goes with all games, a review is meant to give insight, not to decide for you. What is important to me, might not be important to you. A review should never take the place of personal experience.","April 4, 2014","false","0.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","1"

The whole thing is built on the concept of time padding to fill out a play through.  The battle system is constatnly used against you, though you can easily turn that around and be just as cheap, yet it doesn't help when bosses and even (more than likely) random monsters will have so much more AP than you do.  There's just something wrong with a game when bosses are easier than the random encounters that come before hand.\n\nThe characters in general are all bland and basically have no character developement between the start and near the end.  The heroines of each generation really require no reason to start liking you other than the game deems it so, so why honestly even have it in there at this point?  It's all just shoveled into your face to accept and move on.  Even if you can get a decent character you like, they end up either disappearing after a certain generation, or they have no lines.\n\nTo cut things short,  this game is bad.  I've already wasted more than enough money on it.  I hope you don't make the same mistake.

Agarest:GoW does great in story, but I feel the combat lacking. As I've played the game I am finding my self enjoying the story a lot, and I love the idea of different generations. However, it's the combat that "kills" the game for me. Don't get my wrong I love turn-based RPGs (Fire Emblem anyone?), though it seems that the combat here is way to repetitive.\n\nTo clarify, it feels as if the game is drawn out for longer than it should. I got the DLCs for free when I got the game, and I ended up just using them so I could continue on with the story. Even with that the game still felt like it was taking longer than it should. I do know JRPGs are generally long, but this game felt like it went overboard.\n\nOverall would I play this game? Yes, if I had the time to. Would I recommend the game? No, not unless I know someone will adore everything about the game.\n\nArt 10/10\nSoundtrack 7/10\nGameplay 6/10\nStory 9/10\n\n(Keep in mind this review is only coming from playing through the first generation only)","March 19, 2014","false","12.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have only currently played a few hours into it, it does have some interesting mechanics, in an almost board game style movement system.\n\nThe movement system allows a type of synergy style play which allows for some interesting strategy.\n\nThe art style is as expected wonderful, and the music is good fun with wonderful mix of Japanese pop metal.\n\nThere is a LOT to read in the tutorials at the start explain so much so quickly that it is a little daunting, but the more you stick with it the faster you start stringing together attacks and enjoying a more rewarding combat style.\n\nTwo things I would say is if you intend on taking on this game, then firstly I would expect the play to get better after a good few hours, this is not a game that you can see everything it has to offer up front, as with most games of this type they reward hard work, nothing is simply given to you. And secondly take the tutorials slowly, as it is easy to get overwhelmed and miss how certain things work propley. The tutorials does a good job of explaing a lot, but does seem to brush over some of the more basic elements which I had to have a think about in order to get the most out of it. I would tackle this when you have a few hours to sit down and learn how to play.\n\nFrom what I have played so far I can reccomend this to anyone who enjoy's J-RPG's and anyone who like a varied and synegristic turn based combat system.\n\nLook forward to trying some more","March 1, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reviilagoon/recommended/237890/","reviilagoon","Revii Lagoon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reviilagoon/","373 products in account","First and foremost, this is very much a niche game, it is not for everyone. What really drew me in to playing so much of the game, doing two playthroughs, was the combat system. At it's core, Agarest GoW is a tactical turn based strategy RPG, and it does that very well. Combat is interesting, complex, and full of depth. It isn't perfect though, each battle can last for several minutes due to a few factors. First being archaic pre-determined load times of battles, you can have GoW on a SSD, have it load in miliseconds, yet all the battles take 30 seconds to load the enemies and players. Combat animations can be skipped, which helps, but it still doesn't speed up the process of setting up your attacks, which is fun, but time consuming.\n\nStory wise, GoW has a great, and very long main story. With any of the DLC weapons to get through the early generations quickly, you are looking at a 125+ hour story, and without them, it could easly be 150+ hours, before you get to the final boss. The story is an epic tale of a world slowly being consumed by darkness, and you fight, literally for over 100 years, to save the world, which is slowly being taken over by demon armies. Most of the characters are very interesting, and have their own unique personalities and motivations. You really do get a feeling that you know who a character is, and why they are there, it just might take some time to flesh out a character. Oh, and there are a lot of playable characters, 30+ in fact, from all the generations, not including nearly every enemy in the game which can be turned into a party member if you choose to do so. You really do have a large variety of characters and skill sets to choose from, and each generation change always forces you to change up your party members and play style in some way.\n\nOne other issue I had was that in order to get the most out of seeing all the events and experiencing the game, you need to play through the perfect path. Pre-post game stuff, as well as the full post game doesn't even unlock unless you follow a very specific set path of choices throughout the game. If you want the most out of the game, you really do need to follow a perfect path guide.\n\nWhat made me kept playing was simply how much fun the combat was, up until post-game, the combat was very diverse and interesting. Post-game however really devolves into a cheese fest where you use the cheeziest stratigies in order to beat bosses. Who would think you can kill gods, dragons, demons, devils, and all sorts of mythical creatures using grass as your primary weapon.\n\nOne last note about the DLC, the weapons are powerful, some of which are nearly as powerful as the strongest weapons in the game. They really do save a lot of time though, because let's face it, there is a lot of grinding for things. Even with powerful weapons, in generation 3 and beyond you can easily die to bosses if you aren't careful.\n\nIf you are a fan of Strategy RPG's, love a good story, and don't mind putting 125+ hours into a game, Agarest Generations of War is for you.","March 7, 2015","true","198.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, as much of a final fantasy and turn based strat game lover I am, the FF Tactics like graphics/gameplay turned me away. The biggest mistake I believe I made honestly.\n\nSince purchasing this game, I have been immersed in the story, the dating sim, and combat of this game. The gameplay seems to be quite continuous, which I enjoy that the only slowness from the games comes from me stopping to go over status, items and the like. The music is really good, in my opinion as well. I'm thrilled with most of the music in this game.\n\nAside from the graphics being outdated, the gameplay itself rivals Fire emblem and aside from the lack of an in depth tutorial or information menu, the game seemingly welcomes new players. I've been playing on Normal with only a few roadblocks stopping me in the beginning with strategies and the like getting me killed.

The mechanics for combat and character development do actually work and are actually interesting, however there is far too much of everything. Too many fights, too many complicated recipes, too many item components, too many kills required to get a title, too many titles, even too many generations. You need a mindset that feels satisfied when grinding things out. I liked the art, storyline, and characters but some people will not like the 'fan service', in other words the images of scantily clad women to keep adolescent Japanese boys happy.\n\nThe voice acting is still in Japanese with subtitles but I almost preferred that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rererak/recommended/237890/","rererak","Vaellin The Bard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rererak/","57 products in account","For those that meet me in person, I often talk about this game. Agarest is, as I have defined it, a "dating sim tactics game." So far, it is not raunchy, which is something I appreciate, and the story is interesting and doesn't treat you like a complete idiot. This surprised me as at one point I had to make a couple of logic jumps, ones that would make sense in the real world but is often fit in awkwardly in RPGs.\n\nThe concept, by the way, is simple. You, the hero, are stuck in a war between good and evil. As a member of the "dark" forces, you question your role and break away. Immediately you recruit people and, in particular, a goddess (I think) and three girls who are said to be drawn to you. You, the hero, must make choices between light and dark, which girl you want to end up with, and several other things. THE GIRL YOU PICK MATTERS as whoever you choose changes your descendent, which you play as! There is, in essence, several stories in one (5 to be total). I will confess, I have not played enough of this game to know the quality of the rest of the story, but it is a good solid game. I've been playing for hours and have ventured very slowly across the board. Also, I find it fun that you can miss two of the girls you could end up with.\n\nCombat-wise, I'm impressed. I have played several tactics games and notice many will implement their own little feature. Disgaea had stacking, for example. This game has AP and linking fights. AP is used for everything. Use a skill? It costs AP. Use an item? AP please! Move? Well there's an AP. You get AP at intervals (usually when the character's turn comes up, but I'll get to the part where it doesn't). So long as you have the AP you can keep fighting. Some skills are no longer useable due to range or other reasons I have yet to determine, but most of the time you can use five skills if you absolutely wish. Sometimes it's worth waiting though, even if it means getting a hit, so that your partner can swoop in. This is "linking" (they use another word for it but I forget that). Each character has particular squares that link to each other which means that if it is their turn or someone else's turn who they are linked to, they can join the fight. It helps since my strongest mage as abyssmal move speed but my secondary mage has a decent travel time. I often have the second mage move up (or the hero) and use them to make combo moves (they have those too!) and defeat the enemies. It means you have to be constantly aware of your character's positioning because moves often move you and break the link, but it opens up so much more in the ways of strategy.\n\nCharacters are customizable too! Each level you get points to distribute and each weapon opens up slots to put skills in. There are some obvious limitations, though, but that adds a spice and makes a hell of a lot of sense. For example, my first mage can increase her int for very cheap, her luk and agi for a decent amount, but avoid Vit and Str at all cost!\n\nAnyway, this game is quickly becoming a favorite. I'm not as far as I wish to make a solid review but it easily gets an 8.5/10 from me","July 14, 2014","true","13.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

No obstacles either.\n-As is common with Jrpg fare, quite repetative.\n-What it took to upgrade most of the later items was borderline ludicrous,  you are almost forced to buy the DLC in some cases since their's just no way you'll fully upgrade your more unique weapons or armor otherwise... at least not without an absurd amount of grinding in an already heavy grind game.\n-The "dark & light" meter don't appear to mean much.\n\nFor myself, this is one of those games that I play for a bit, leave for X amount of time, then ultimately come back to & play for a couple of hours at a time.  I like some of the concepts, but the execution could really be polished.\n\n6/10","December 11, 2013","true","75.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a game, wholly Japanese, through and through, and for that reason, this game is worth it!\nHowever, you do need to have that Anime gene in order to truly enjoy this game. The storyline is overly masculine based, and the combat looks like it should be on an old fashioned 1990s game boy. How this game is a PC game in the 2000s? I'll never comprehend.\n\nThe game itself sports a not very engaging story, which is very slow moving and full of pointless, classic Japanese 'smile and nod' stuff, which was honestly always just a filler tactic to me when the writers ran out of ideas, or didn't know how to get out an awkward dialogue...Smile and nod was a golden rule of thumb for this game, and it made me sad.\n\nThe combat is turn based, and is the only time graphics are added...And if your gaming is fueled by eye candy, then you will want to repeatedly ram this game with the biggest, hardest, most vicious ♥♥♥♥♥ you can possibly buy in Amsterdam...It is GROTESQUE 1990s Gameboy graphics. ~14 graphics are designated to each character, and the game takes place on a checker board style platform. The combat system is RIDICULOUSLY complicated, and takes AGES to learn even the simplest strategy in the game(Luckily the game as an "I'm here for the story, not the combat" option, as well as an 'in between' and "I'm here for the combat, not the story" option to boot, which atleast is a plus)\n\nIf only the story wasn't so disinteresting. The storyline is a cluster**** ♥♥♥♥ of 1 guy in a white trenchcoat protecting girls from danger. That's it, and it honestly gets irritating to watch(I'm a feminist, I LOVED Claymore and Sekirei and Heaven's Lost Property where the WOMEN got to be the powerful ones for a change!)\n\nNow some of you Anime fans are probably already unsheathing your replica katana swords, and loading your Soft gun Van Hellsing handguns with paint bullets etc., but let it be known that I have been a die-hard Anime fan all of my life(I watched Aika when I was 10!). I love Anime, and its a passion of mine, and that's why I got this game, but I had hoped it was less like the average run-of-the-mill Animes, and more of a standalone I-Am-My-Own-Game Anime. But life sometimes gives you lemons.\n\nIn this case though, the lemons gave you lemonade, even just a small glass with too little sugar in it, but still better than none at all: The Steam Background images.\n\nThese Steam background images(You can see one on my profile page), are some of the most expensive, and rare on Steam, some going for a mere $5.00, while the most expensive I've seen went for $60, multiple times the value of the game itself! The cards being expensive to buy, and the backgrounds yielding SO MUCH market value, has led this game's popularity on steam to SKYrocket not because of its quality, but because of the rewards you get for playing it(I blame the partially revealed anime b00bies)\n\nRegardless...I am not going to rate this game based on its Backgrounds on Steam. As a game, this game is not worth playing, so if you are not interested in the backgrounds, and want a good, fun Anime game? I'll not recommend this one.\n\nHowever, as goes with all games, a review is meant to give insight, not to decide for you. What is important to me, might not be important to you. A review should never take the place of personal experience.","April 4, 2014","false","0.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","1"

Unless you are willing to stand up to the unnecessarily long repetitive battles, the 3-5 music themes this game seems to have playing over and over, and story/dialogues so cliché to anime-type stuff. If you really can't help yourself and for some reason you NEED to try this game out, wait for it to go on sale, I got it for just 2-3 dollars during one of the Steam summer sales and even then I felt like wanting to ask for a refund.

Unfortunately, I felt invested enough to keep coming back.\n\nAbout halfway through the second generation, every non-boss battle will become the same thing: If you aren't using powerful gear (from dlc or previous playthroughs) your team are all glass cannons (even if all you do is stack defense) and the entire enemy team are all damage sponges. The AI will mercifully dogpile one or two characters and let you whittle them away one by one. The average battle will take fifteen minutes. As there is an average of three-six battles between each event, that starts to add up.\n\nBosses themselves are all the same: Stupidly high damage (rendering defensive characters useless), accuracy (rendering dodge-based characters useless) and often have attacks that will wipe out whole teams in one blow if bunched together. Unless you're fighting a small force, this is EVERY boss-battle in the game.\n\nThis isn't helped by the crafting system: You need certain books to unlock new gear to craft, but there is no indication of where you will find "Basic Weapons III" or even what weapons it may unlock. Do you get it from a cutscene? Did you miss it in one of the exploration maps? You won't know until you find a "Basic Weapons IV" later on. Also, some books are only obtainable from special, missable, events. Oh, and you will most likely need weapons in "Basic Weapons III" as materials for "Basic Weapons IV", so ignoring the issue will bite in the back you later on.\n\nThe other glaring problem with crafting is how disproportionate some materials rarity are compared to their usefulness. As an example, one particular bracelet is useless on its own, but is a core material for at least four other items. However, one of the materials for the bracelet is only dropped from a single boss monster that only appears in one location in the entire game. Even if you can effortlessly overkill the monster to guarantee an item, you still need to backtrack through an entire dungeon just to get to it.\n\nIgnoring the crafting does you a major disservice in the battles to come, yet you'll need to make use of a guide just to figure out what you should be able to craft and where to get everything to make it.\n\nThe PC version is kind enough to provide various dlc along with the original game: turn them on regardless of difficulty you choose. The game is only enjoyable once you can bypass the incessant grind.","January 2, 2015","false","273.0"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","0"

When I first heard of this game, I was like "No way, two of my favourite things in one?! Too good to be true!".....oh how right I was....\n\nThe game promises an epic story mixed with RPG gameplay. The problem here is with the RPG part. You have a tipical Japanese visual novel story, which is good for what it is also loved the family generation system. (that was one of the reason why I bought the game), but they just had to F*** it up.\n\nThrough the story progression you constantly have to battle over and over and over and while it was midly entertaining at first, quickly becomse boring, which wouldn't be a problem if the whole combat system would have been done well. Unfortunatelly this is not the case here.... Combat is repetitive waaaaaaay too repetitive, it gets really boring to see the same enemies and use the same strategie for the 15th time. Also, the combat system itself is unpolished, I would dare to say, not finished. When you try to attack an enemy with a skill, the game automatically puts the character in on of the sides of the enemy to attack, but if you have an AOE skill and say you would like to attack from another side, you CAN'T do it. This becomes really annoying when you try to come up with your own strategies, instead of trying to addept to the game, and because of this other parts of the game suffers as well. One of the driving feature are the fame you can get from the taverns various challenges. The main problem here, is that ALL OF THEM requires grinding, and I mean MASSIVE GRINDING, which is already a pain to see through with an unfinished battle system.\n\nI completed the 1st story only, because I just couldnt bear with the constant battling any longer, they are just too boring and no fun at all. They dont even added the option of skipping all the battle parts and just at least see through the visual novel part, which I finded good, especially with the generation system.\n\nOverall, the reason why I dont recommend the game is because the bad covers up all the good in it. Boring and reptitive battles can make even the most hardened visual novel fans scare away.","October 29, 2014","false","29.6"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

Son of famed general rallies smaller forces together and then squares off against the darkening, blah blah blah".  Ever watch an fantasy Anime or play a Jrpg before?  Then you have.\n\nCharacters:  Does this sound familiar?

Smaphics!   Nintendo era pixies.   "Cutscene" is just still frames of your standard saucer eye anime characters that look like every other anime or jrpg you have ever seen.\n\nGameplay:  Ever play Disgea?

In fact alot of this basically is Disgea but without any Fun or Creativity or Imagination involved.\n\nPay to Win:  Buy the full game.  Want to get to the end?  Spend the next decade of your life grinding to level up.  OR pay another 20 dollars or so on "DLC" for over powered items and the 4 different types of in game money so you can skip all that and just breeze through every fight even on hard.  The choices are endless.\n\nOpenworld:  Hahah!  this is a JRPG.  Not only that but a Classic mode JRPG.  Doesn't even try to create the illusion of open world.    The world map looks like this >>>>>>>>>>>>  A straight line!  yay!\n\nMusic:  A song for World map.  A similar song for Battle.  And a 3rd similar but slower song for emotions.\n\nVoice Acting:  It's all in japanese, so who the hell knows!?  Yes, we are far too lazy to pay 5 voice actors 5K to read these lines.  Far too much!  Maybe we will release some more DLC that adds nothing to the game and charge you for it.\n\nWTF is this garbage highly rated?  Who knows!  And they made 3 of these!!!  4 if you count Crosspoop.","December 27, 2015","false","17.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

An SRPG with some romantic elements.  The problem is that the combat is pretty boring and takes a while.\n\nThat on its own wouldn't be too bad if you could mitigate the fights, but then you get to the part where the fights are a random battle system, each one taking so long to complete.  Just 3 random battles after entering that part, I put the game down and will probably never play it again.\n\nIt's too bad.  With some refining on the combat, it'd probably be a pretty good game.

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews.\n\nOne Hour Reviews - Game 1\nAgarest: Generations of War\nPurchase Date: 5/14/2015\n\nAgarest: Generations of War opens like a standard JRPG.  It doesn't waste any time getting you into the meat of the game which is it's tactical battles.  I was quickly reminded of Final Fantasy Tactics, which I'd played a little of on my PSP.\n\nThe tactical battles do add an extra layer of strategy by letting you move your party around on the battlefield in a square grid, and picking what direction you face, which will influence the way enemies can hit and damage you.   It also adds an additional element of stategy by enabling special chained attacks which happen by placing members of your team in a particular formation, although I had trouble actually executing the chained attacks themselves.\n\nThis movement sits on top of the usual turn based battle options you'd expect to see from a Final Fantasy game.  You can attack, use items or stand by to save up your 'action points', which allows you to use stronger powers.\n\nThe story also seemed pretty typical for a JRPG, but of course this is hard to judge from only the first hour of play.  I didn't see much of an open-world element to this game; rather it seems pretty linear and mostly just a way to take you from one fight to the next, with story beats in between.\n\nOne thing I found a but distracting is the voice acting is all Japanese.   I actually wasnt' expecting any voice acting at all, as I'm used to these games being pure text.  It's a little weird not having any option for English voiceovers, but not so much to be a distraction from the game.\n\nI do wish the game had a little more on video options.  I'm not one of these "PC Master Race" people who demand 3 pages of video options for every game I play.  But it bugs me when you can't even change resolution.\n\nAll in all though, I liked what I saw, and this is definitely a game I'd like to come back to and see where the story goes.  Anyone who likes tactical combat and JRPGs would feel at home with this game.\n\nOverall Recommendation:  Keep\n\n\n\n","June 14, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I also played the 360 version, which was also bad, and wondered if they made any improvements over it.  On both accounts I was disappointed.  This was the 360 version with no changes made, no polish, ported, and kicked out onto the PC.  I could not bother marathoning my way through this game, hell I couldn't even get past the first island before "Why the hell am I playing this crap?" blew through my head.  Without a sufficient answer I uninstalled the game.\n\nTo discuss its problems is like trying to pick apart a mountain.  The first and most obvious, as I understand Japanese, is its translation.  Since the text is in English and the voice acting is in Japanese, nothing hides this.  In fact I would encourage anyone who is bilingual to pick up this game so you can read the text as your listening to what the character says so you too can say "Who the hell translated that?"  At first the errors are small enough to only be nit-picks, a word here, they don't properly emphasize what the character is implying, only small errors.  The further you get, the more obvious the problems become, item text is word salad or bitcode since they didn't bother translating it after they changed the font, they stop using punctuation marks entirely, some things just come out as engrish jumbled together.  So, yeah the translation and localization job is terrible enough to define what poorly localized means.\n\nThis brings us to the grind, the massive grind to get skills, build up skills, make weapons, build up weapons, and on and on.  If you play through this, you will sink hundreds of hours easily into just grinding and building up your characters in order to not get crushed by the next set of fights.  Some of this grind becomes exponential where you have to grind for materials to make materials for an item you want or need.\n\nThe combat and battles are boring.  If you were expecting battles like Final Fantasy Tactics or any of your favorite squad based strategy games, prepare to be disappointed.  Much of the combat is set up to remove any depth strategy gives you and focus entirely on levels and gear, such that the story battles are a stat check.  If your stats are here or better, you can progress.  If not, grind some more.  While this would be fine for any sort of turn based JRPG, if you want to make this a strategy RPG, there needs to be some strategy involved.\n\nThe story is standard JRPG fare, an evil entity is going to destroy the world, something about the entity is relevant to the island you're on now so you get a bunch of followers to confront it.  You meet three waifus and choose one to be your true waifu to have a son who will go to a new island and be the protagonist of the next generation and repeat the process with harder enemies and better gear until you get to the generation who will confront the evil entity and bring peace to the world.  The story through each generation is rushed.  You meet several major players, kings, generals, civilizations, cities, and they are tossed out as quickly as they are introduced, leaving you with no impact or interest in the world at all.  Given how much time you spend grinding crap in this game, they could have invested a bit more into its depth so you can be interested in the time you spend in it.\n\nI rarely say this in a review since some games I don't recommend games I enjoy and some games I don't enjoy I'll recommend, but this is a bad game.  This game is bad, there is nothing redeeming to be found here.  You should not buy it even if you are a Data Entry Technician who enjoys his job.","January 23","false","6.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The gameplay, however, is uninspired; considering how much time is put into combat, this is unfortunate.\n\nThe game is worth trying for the first generation (which will start and end an entire story of its own).

I know plenty of people like the puritan JRPGs, but I don't. The main complaint is that a sizable portion of this game is just unituitive.\n\nFor example, while the port is perfectly functional, there wasn't one battle where I didn't have to right click to backtrack at least ten times because I clicked something I wasn't trying to. It becomes especially obnoxious when you're trying to navigate layers of menus, which I normally don't have a problem with, but I couldn't go into the party formation menu to add a character without accidentally rearranging my entire lineup. I'm sure some of you are thinking that I'm the one who's being counterintuitive, and also stupid, but there's just no way around the fact that it's too easy to accidentally do things you weren't trying to do.\n\nThere's also the battle system, which reminds me a little of Valkyria Chronicles (a game I did recommend) with its rating system being a measure of how fast you finished a battle. It's a nice little addition, but when the enemies dart around the board at random and my characters only have a max of 3-4 spaces to hit from (including people with guns, strangely enough), trying to reach that ranking can be more a matter of luck than skill. The game also has a nasty habit of throwing 'supposed to lose' battles at you without giving any indication of whether they are or not, a function that very important so I don't waste ten minutes and a truckload of healing items I didn't have to. Also, on top of that, the battles were slooooooooooow. I love me some grid-based combat, even loved it in Legen of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (I would recommend that game about a milliont times more than this) where it was a bit slow. This is even worse, where random encounters take fifteen minutes to beat, and after like....the seventh one, I already hated the combat. It's all the same arenas and enemies.\n\nThe characteres are...well,  nonsensical. If you're going to have a relationship system based on gaining points with the relationshipees to be, their personalities need to be easy enough to discern, and I had no idea what was going on with these ones. Also, half of them also look like they're 15, which is highly uncomfortable to say the least. It's like a Fire Emblem Awakening where half the party is Nowi. They're very scattershot and/or lack a distinuishable personality, which leads to one of my other big complaints: the relationship system. For those not aware, this game goes for a Fire Emblem: Awakening-type deal (on a smaller scale but with more generations) where you have children with the other characters through a relationship system. The problem is, it's impossible to tell whether your choices will favor one character, another, or both (or for that matter, what's considered light/dark).

Really, I did but... it's so BORING! The battles are just so boring and even though it has a unique battle system... it just has no strategy. The battle system works like a chess board where you move your characters accordingly to their movements capacity, but you also have to keep an eye to where they are facing so they don't get pounded and also where you land can trigger special multi attacks and while this may sound very complex...it's just this. You may take an hour to guess the best position for your characters because..well... they always start at the same positions and the battles all have the same sizes and no changes at all... so it's just boring.\nOh yeah, this is one of those games where you have to grind, but guess what? It is also a game that penalizes you for grinding either! And it will NEVER tell you about until very later in the game! And not just a little penalty, no, it ruins the story. Yup, that's right.

I know plenty of people like the puritan JRPGs, but I don't. The main complaint is that a sizable portion of this game is just unituitive.\n\nFor example, while the port is perfectly functional, there wasn't one battle where I didn't have to right click to backtrack at least ten times because I clicked something I wasn't trying to. It becomes especially obnoxious when you're trying to navigate layers of menus, which I normally don't have a problem with, but I couldn't go into the party formation menu to add a character without accidentally rearranging my entire lineup. I'm sure some of you are thinking that I'm the one who's being counterintuitive, and also stupid, but there's just no way around the fact that it's too easy to accidentally do things you weren't trying to do.\n\nThere's also the battle system, which reminds me a little of Valkyria Chronicles (a game I did recommend) with its rating system being a measure of how fast you finished a battle. It's a nice little addition, but when the enemies dart around the board at random and my characters only have a max of 3-4 spaces to hit from (including people with guns, strangely enough), trying to reach that ranking can be more a matter of luck than skill. The game also has a nasty habit of throwing 'supposed to lose' battles at you without giving any indication of whether they are or not, a function that very important so I don't waste ten minutes and a truckload of healing items I didn't have to. Also, on top of that, the battles were slooooooooooow. I love me some grid-based combat, even loved it in Legen of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (I would recommend that game about a milliont times more than this) where it was a bit slow. This is even worse, where random encounters take fifteen minutes to beat, and after like....the seventh one, I already hated the combat. It's all the same arenas and enemies.\n\nThe characteres are...well,  nonsensical. If you're going to have a relationship system based on gaining points with the relationshipees to be, their personalities need to be easy enough to discern, and I had no idea what was going on with these ones. Also, half of them also look like they're 15, which is highly uncomfortable to say the least. It's like a Fire Emblem Awakening where half the party is Nowi. They're very scattershot and/or lack a distinuishable personality, which leads to one of my other big complaints: the relationship system. For those not aware, this game goes for a Fire Emblem: Awakening-type deal (on a smaller scale but with more generations) where you have children with the other characters through a relationship system. The problem is, it's impossible to tell whether your choices will favor one character, another, or both (or for that matter, what's considered light/dark). A particularly memorable one was where I had to choose what path to get back to a capital with, and I had to reload three times and endure nearly seven minutes of talking just to remake the choice becsause apparently, which path I choose is a huge turn off to both women. There's no way to navigate that system without a guide nearby, unless you want to reload and sit through another 5-10 minutes of text boxes.\n\nSo on the whole, Agarest has a nice little idea in the Generations system, but it can be too counterintuitive and cumbersome to make the journey to that mechanic worth it.","November 25, 2014","false","7.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I also do enjoy a good SRPG playing Fire Emblem and Tactics Ogre so when I saw what Agarest GOW had to offer I was really interested at first, only to find that for anything that I found I like about this game there was an equal flaw that kinda ruined it for me. I will start with what the game offers along with what I liked about it and what ruined it for me.\nStory:\nThe game starts off with the main character (MC) questioning the actions of the kingdom he serves until finally he decided to deflect for the greater good only to have been killed shortly after. He was then revived and given power by a lady in exchange that he and his descendants have to give their lives to seal the darkness that is slowly but surely spreading across the world. The story spans over 5 generations and each one having interesting events, new characters and light humour to keep you engaged. Also since the MC needs his descendants to give up their lives as well he will have to choose a wife. Depending on which wife you choose the offspring will be able to equip different weapons, have different abilities as well as different stat growths. What also defines the offspring would be how much affection the lady had towards the MC, this can be raised or lowered depending on different choices you make the higher the affection, the stronger the offspring. I have yet to play an RPG that span over several generations but Agarest has it done right for the most part, with distinct characters and different ordeals each generation faces I found myself constantly wondering what will happen next while playing.\nGameplay:\nThe game progresses with you choosing which point on a map to move such as towns, certain landmarks and the occasional dungeons between each of these places there are battle points that you must battle and win to be able to advance. Most of the time you will be travelling from town to town to trigger events to progress through the story and sometimes you may have to complete a dungeon to progress.\nCombat is this game plays like an SRPG you move your party of up to 6 across a grind map and perform various skills to take down your foes. Here is where it gets interesting, each character has something called an extended grind whereby if another ally stands on this grind they are link and can chain their abilities together, this allows for huge combos, flashy and satisfying visuals as well as strategic and tactical movement to be able to link all your characters together. On top of that combining certain attacks together will result in a secret art that does high damage to take down your foe much faster. This combat system was very fun to play at first as I found myself trying to mix and match different attacks to uncover different secret arts as well as finding to most effective way to take down my opponent.\nApart from that you will be levelling up your party, trying to get new equipment, uncover new skills and resupply your consumable items for the next major fight.\nMusic:\nMusic is pretty much the only thing in this game that didn’t come with something to ruin for me. Most of the tracks are very suiting for the moment such as the fast paced boss themes to the soothing tunes when the characters are having a heart to heart talk. It was good to the point where sometimes I would just paused the game just to listen to it. Though it isn’t as good as music composed by Nobuo Uematsu or Michiru Yamane they certainly have a special place in my heart.\nWhat ruined it for me:\nAlright now for the where i will get slapped with comments on how I am a casual that can’t appreciate this game or me whining like a little kid and saying that I am too young for this game.\nAlthough I did enjoy the story for the game what ruined it for me was the ending and how ridiculously dumb it is to obtain the true end. Essentially the game has 3 ending bad, normal and true ending though it would be more precise to name them worst, bad and good ending as getting anything but the true ending will make you feel like you have wasted your time. (I got the normal ending FYI) So how do you obtain the true ending? It boils down to you having to follow a strict set of choices to make that is pretty much impossible to do unless you have a guide and by strict I mean very strict, one misclick for a decision or doing something in the wrong order and you can kiss your true end good bye. No game should make it this hard to get the true end and it kinda ruined it for me as I had to make decisions not based on my sound judgement but simply because if it is needed in the true end. Another thing that ruined it for me was how they transited to each event, there wasn’t like walk around then a cutscene occurs or do something then you progress through the story. It is literally just get from point A to point B see event then move to point C then watch event then move to point D watch event fight story battle watch event all while having to fight unnecessary battle points between each point. Basically the pace of the game was very formulaic and didn’t feel natural its always fight battle points watch event fight battle points watch event rise repeat with some dungeons on the side that do little to change things up.\nGameplay was also ruined for me simply because it is very slow and the game overstays its welcome. This game will take you about 60-80 hours to complete the main story yup just the main story! Now this wouldn’t be a problem if the combat wasn’t so slow, you will be fighting a lot of non-story related battle and since you can’t flee you have to fight and win but each fight is just so slow it will get repetitive very fast, seriously I got bored of the combat at the third generation. Now there is an auto function whereby an AI will take over and do the fight for you but the AI is dumb like really dumb, most of the time they will waste each turn killing one monster when there is a chance to kill them all also since they are dumb, expect your characters to die stupid deaths simply because the AI doesn’t know how to position your party. Honestly you will get bored of the gameplay very quickly and I found myself feeling like “let’s get this battle over and done with so I can progress with the story” at the later parts of the game.\nAnother thing that could be an issue is that getting equipment in the game which is a huge, unnecessary and tiresome process. The shop will never update its stock unless you do crafting however you cannot craft weapons unless you have the crafting books for it and most of these books are hidden in dungeons that are very hard to navigate through so unless you look up a map online you are unlikely to loot everything in the dungeon. What does this mean? Well you could possibly be screwed and not be able to craft the weapon you want as all the crafting books are interlink example you have crafting books 1, 2 and 4 but not 3 but in order to craft weapons from book 4 you need components that can only be crafted from book 3 so yeah say goodbye to that new sword you were so eager to get your hands on. There is simply just too much unnecessary grinding in this game and it does not feel rewarding sadly.\nOverall Agarest has a good foundation for a SRPG, JRPG hybrid but overdid the things that made it fun to the point where you will start to hate it, a perfect example of “too much of a good thing becomes bad” and many other outstanding game flaws that is compensated with some mild fan service, seriously just google that ♥♥♥♥ as googling won’t cost you money! Of course if you are a hardcore SRPG lover or a completionist this game is right up your alley with many minor things for you to uncover just for game completion sake and many achievements to unlock.\n\nTL;DR: Unless you are a hardcore SRPG fan or a completionist don’t get this game","April 7, 2015","false","79.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

The principle of several generations fighting the same menace lured me in. And I can definetely see how and why T-RPG fans might like. Prefering the likes of Fire Emblem, I, however, am not among those who appreciate the thought of spending tremendous amount of times (I mean, 50 hours is already quite good for me).\nBut enough about what I like and don't like, you don't care much about it and you're right. What about the game ?\n\nWell, if you wanted some originality, you're off the mark. It begins by the overused trope of Evil getting back to work and people trying to stop itn because Evil beings are not famed to be too people-friendly, ya know. You start off with Leo, a former general from Gridamas, who swore to protect a elf girl he never knew before and is put to death in the process. But never fear ! Random divine being walks by and offers him life, if only he accepts to be her servant, and all his offspring after him, to become "soul vessels".\nWell, that's it : you assemble a party and fight the different minions of Summerill (seriously, it's his name), the Lord of Darkness trying to get back to business, i.e. destroying the world, because Evil is Evil, I guess. Then you dot it four more times on four other continents, with a different generation each time.\n\nI won't lie : they are funny moments and the writing is not that bad. Alas, you can still see where it all leads and it remains too classic. And the whole gimmick about choosing a partner in order to produce the next poor dude whose soul will be used to seal one of the five towers of darkness (yeah, right) is not that a big thing. You make some choice for gaining affection with  the three ladies available, sometimes you don't understand why it sets you on the Dark and Light pattern, then at the end of the generation you pick one. The impact on gameplay it that your son will have a different weapon mastery and stats depending on your wife.\n\nIn theory, it calls for replay value, yes ? Well, no, it's not mandatory. See, it would have been wonderful if the gameplay was solid AND interesting. But honestly it is not that much, maps are tiny and so often the same it's painful, you have AP, skills to use, the possibility to link characters to produce devastating combos ; you can craft new weapons and enhance them, there's also titles to be had, monsters to capture...\nBut all in all, if you've played Final Fantasy Tactics, it is likely to appear limited. Repetitive battles don't help : on the world map, you will be forced to go through countless storyless and dull battles, sometimes four in a row. Even if you clear them in one turn (the game sure expects you to do so, if you want a S rank to boost a lot your gains in XP, money and such) it's still about five minutes that feel like a hack'n'slash on a grid.\nSure you will need the XP and other earnings, but the truth is those battles represent 80% of all fights. No kidding. And the "boss battles" are the cherry on top of two or more generic battles with some minions harder than usual, you have to do the whole thing in a row without healing between each session. OK, there's more challenge, still : not so really tactical.\n\nAs for the dungeons, they feel out of place. You jump around badly rendered 3-D environments for some more random battles and some items locked in chests. Huzzah ! Add to his too few environment artworks for dialogues purpose, and a great soundtrack but becoming hastily redundant.\nSo, yeah, maybe there's one-hundred hours worth of gameplay in this game if you want to do everything and grind like hell. I must admit I'm kinda tired of seeing excessive length as a praise. Because there, it's excessive with all the repetitive and obligatory battles.\n\nAgarest is not downright horrible but you would have to be patient and lenient to fully appreciate it. And even then, I would only recommend it at half the price.","December 5, 2013","false","9.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In a huge storydriven rpg/vn story is usually the main focus of players attention right?\nThe battles should be little spice inbetween to keep things interesting. Well the system is certainly interesting, it has loads of customization and tactics etc but the issue is that its strategy on a grid every time.\nIts VERY tedious to deal with moving all 6 characters into postion, then attacking with all of them (move and attack are seperate for some reason). Then moving them all back into position for the next turn (they have to be standing on specific tiles in relation to each other to perform combo attacks).\nNow you might think "well thats ok i can just rush my guys forward and kill the enemy in normal fights and save tedium of respositioning for the hard fights! ill save heaps of time!"\nNo you wont.\nThe game preempts this by making each and every enemy a huge damage sponge that will require the full turn of 3 characters to kill AT A MINIMUM (and thats just a normal kill you need to "overkill" monsters to get item drops to craft your gear so really you need to use basically every characters moves on 1 enemy), then the game doublesdown on the tedium by making you fight 6-8 monsters at a time.\nSo thats 8 move turns and 8 attack turns to clear a normal run of the mill group of monsters. This takes freaking forever! like 10-15min per fight, around 50 fights per section and 5 sections in the game.\n\nIts such a shame too singe the story/vn elements are well done and interesting for what they are.\nPity they are locked behind a massive wall of boring combat.\nI mean sure these kind of fights are fine for bosses and the like but just getting my xp from the local trolls should not be an epic struggle.","December 19, 2015","false","21.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's very simple to pick-up-and-play, if you do it on Easy mode. Normal is challanging but not impossible, I yet have to try hard.\nThe sotry spans more than a few generations, each generation tackles a different branch of the main plot while not straying away from the path to achive the main goal, whatever you choose it to be.\nIt delivers multitudes of possible paths, and they don;t all lead to the same ending. In fact, achiveing the "true end" is an achivement in the game.\n\nIf you are tired of games that try too hard and fail, or they don't bother trying at all. This is a game for you. The battle system is not complicated, find the books and read what the skill combos are (extended skills found in the Essoteric Book tab on the battle screen, the confusing part is that it seems the translations are done bu two teams and the Essoteric Book items are named Seret Arts, but that's writen in the game Guide, so NBD). However, depending on your party composition, the weapons and gear equiped and the combinations of skills available based on the composition you may find yourself up a creek more than once, Generation 1 or 2 not so much, but past Gen. 3 it gets to be an uphill battle.\n\nI can recommend the DLCs as some of them are pay-to-win, but others are purely cosmetic, they are all well thought out and there is no one DLC that will suit all needs/wants. The extra dungeons are a nice addition (they become available only after you complete that continent's generation main sotry).\n\nI have played trough 4 times, and I have only done half of what is made possible. I still have a lot to do, but it never felt like work, or grinding.","November 27, 2015","true","272.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

However I don't get to make a choice until after a few hours of playing.

It has great deal of potential and it's heartbreaking to see it wasted. This game has so many features - complex battle system, monster hunting and catching, crafting and enhancing, dating elements, generations of characters just to name few, yet many of them feels not needed or rushed. Game doesn't make you want to use them at all. I can't call Agarest the worst game I ever played, I can't call it a very bad game either, but it's certainly not a game I can recommend to anyone.\n\nStory is interesting, but characters are rather flat. Not bad, but they feel unfinished. You have huge team of people, yet can hardly say anything about the character or reasons others have to travel with you. In most cases it isn't hard to guess who's good and who's bad, good guys look innocent and noble, bad ones cunning and evil. Cute girls look cute, brave girls look brave. Everything is so obvious, you hardly ever feel surprised by the turn of events. Main antagonist and his heirs all seem to suffer from Mary Sue complex and many of their partners are flattened to the role of brainless, boobs showing dolls - most of them doesn't feel real at all. There are few interesting characters out there, but in the end the lack of deepness is a biggest flaw of the game, most of the characters is not memorable at all. I spent nearly 80h in this game and I can't remember even 30% of characters that are traveling with me.\n\nCombat system was interesting at first, but gets repeatable very fast. I hardly see it as a flaw, but this game is too long in general. I felt like doing same stuff over and over again. Each battle is the same like earlier one. Of course the game has something for people, who are a bit tired of killing and want to enjoy the story mode - the autobattle system, that is supposed to play combats for you, while you prepare your favourite tea. However, don't be fooled by it. Your AI controlled characters have an IQ of a potato and will keep dying all of the time. You have a healer in the party? Great. Just don't expect it to stay in the last line and support others. It will act like a first line tank and die first. You're fighting against fire elemental? Expect party members to throw fire spells in it like there is no tomorrow. Suddenly a fight you could easily finish yourself turns into a slaughter of your team. In fact it's best not to watch those battles at all, unless you enjoy face palming every few seconds.\n\nThe world and environment are another very disappointing element. Everything is empty and dull. Dungeons are big empty spaces you just run through, many of them are just slightly altered versions of earlier dungs. Even though you're visiting different continents and places in each generation, all maps and towns look the same. Same npc's, same spaces, there is no variety that would make the world feel truly alive. Music is just generic sounds that play in the background that hardly anyone will want to hear again after the game ends, in fact I got sick and tired of it after second generation.\n\nMany small things are annoying. Lack of possibility to resurrect outside of battle, characters that are not in the party will not gather exp which makes them useless in the long run, crafting is much more complicated than it should, even though game forces battle spots (battles are not random most of time) on you, you still have to grind exp in the end. Nothing in this game is memorable or makes you want to go back to playing it again.\n\nThing I liked the most? Battle customization of the characters. Even though each character has default class, you're the one deciding what skills they use and those can be changed almost anytime. You need one more healer? Conver your fire casting mage into one just for the boss battle. Or give a ressurect to your tank to support team in hardest moments. You decide. Of course this brings yet another flaw of the game - there is no preset system that would allow you to save different sets of skills and equipment. You need to change everything manually each time you need different skills or items for battle.\n\nPros:\n- The overall story.\n- Great customisation of your character's set of skills.\n- Has this old-school jrpg feeling to it.\n\nCons\n- Repetitiveness.\n- Even more repetitiveness.\n- Too long.\n- Empty, dead world.\n- Dull and boring maps.\n- Grind.\n- Too much boobs, too little attitude in the characters.\n- Story and characters just don't make up for all the cons.","May 28","false","78.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

There's nothing on hit rate, there's simply nothing!\n\nDuring combat, it's downright impossible to know what choices to make.  You end up dealing with a lot of trial and error, and using characters valued action points, all because you don't know anything.   It's infuriating to overkill an enemy well beyond what's necessary, only for you to have no points to deal with the other enemies on the map.\n\nIn short, you can't formulate effective strategies to quickly overcome the odds.  This makes combat slow and frustrating, to the point you feel like you're not really getting anywhere. It's a chore.\n\nThe only plus to Agarest is the nice artwork.

But all-in-all, perhaps it's because I'm very much used to simple battle mechanics of Vandal Hearts, Saiyuki, Dynasty Tactics and the lot, I can't get myself to like the battle mechanic presented by this game.\n\nAlthough I'm totally fine with grinding, the battle somewhat played out in (for me) a very bizzare combo and linking system. The concept of this is easy to grasp, but very hard to master, and it's not in a good way, frustrating at it's best. One of the things I'm not content with is that several people need to be positioned in a certain way to link for combos. It's really not a good design, in my point of view, it limits the character's positioning and it creates this weird vulnerability for certain characters that is positioned. Being a player who's familiar with the olden tactics mechanics, the attacks somewhat baffles me, I'm very much used to a person having a melee weapon attacking someone that is adjacent to the particular person and a ranged person with an area of attack, this isn't what is presented in this game. The battle system felt very alien to me and that's the main drawback that I experienced. So if you're looking for a battle system as compared to games such as Dynasty Tactics or Saiyuki, I'd suggest look somewhere else; this game does not provide that.","January 1, 2015","false","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheOnlyZII/recommended/237890/","TheOnlyZII","Ves","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheOnlyZII/","187 products in account","I Completely Enjoyed playing this game however i wouldn't Recommend it for anyone.\nas for why i woudn't Recommend it even though i really enjoyed it, LETS START :\n\nIf it was just an average RPG with the same story and gimmicks, I would have been happy to give this game an above-average rating. The problem is that the game falls flat on its face when it comes to the actual "game" part of the game.\n\nI have never seen so much need for an auto-battle feature before in my life. The auto-battle exists (barely), but is so mind-numbingly stupid that you generally have to go a third of the game backwards to find opponents you can auto-grind against, but it's still far superior to having to spend the hundreds of hours it takes to beat the game gaining XP the normal way.\n\nGrinding is excruciating and necessary. On Hard, bosses will kill your characters in one hit, no matter even if you spent every single character point on NOTHING but getting more hit points. (And I did, for every character, because there's little point in anything else.) When they use their super-moves, (which they can do at will,) they often get the "overkill" bonus for dealing triple the HP of my characters in damage. Survival is a matter of packing max recovery items and spreading out so that only one character dies at a time.\n\nBecause every combo you can do has to be not just pre-planned before battle, but pre-equipped and oftentimes grinded for, itself, the theoretically tactical grid-based combat basically always comes down to getting into the exact same formations, using the exact same combos you've metered out exactly to take advantage of the exact amount of AP you can spend. There is nothing in the game to make any one given battle any seriously different from another, besides maybe the bosses, but even every boss starts looking the same after a while. (In fact, at the end, they just outright keep reusing the same boss.) Hence, auto-battling just to keep from drooling boredom. (And because the auto-battle is awful, you have to grind more on auto-battle to survive auto-battling.)\n\nWhen "playing" the game usually entails just putting a weight on the button to walk upwards, and then leaving for a while so that auto-battle auto-levels your characters, just so I can do something else while "playing" the game, it's a problem.\n\nWorst of all, there's basically no way to get the good ending without using a guide, and if you screw up anything (and the game gives you basically no hints as to how you're screwing yourself over, or even where to look,) you have to start the WHOLE GAME OVER TO TRY AGAIN. That's right, 500 hours down the drain. When you DO finally beat the game, the game says, "Congrats, now onto the TRUE FINAL BOSS, which incidentally, is level 700. What, you're only level 100? Here's a new place to grind forever in, and all your old characters back, back at level 20. No, of course there's no experience sharing. Grind harder, sucker." I estimate "beating" this game will take roughly 1,000 hours, and I'm not even exaggerating.\n\nThat's roughly where I figured I was just completely not having fun anymore, and abandoned the game for good.\n\nOh, but as a bonus, they include "free DLC" that they originally charged people for, which basically includes just plain BUYING exp. Yeah, that's right, their business model was to make a game where you grind forever, and then sell people exp.\n\nIn summary, the story and style of the game may or may not be to your taste, but the actual mechanics of the game get downright masochistic. When a game is best played by having a book to read to get you through the boring parts, (read: 99.999% of the game,) then it's not exactly something I can in good conscious recommend to any but the most rabid of JRPG dating-sim fans.","March 23, 2015","false","135.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you have played Final Fantasy Tactics, or many of the other turn based, strategy oriented JRPGs on the market, keep in mind that the system in this game is very very watered down. Battlefields are flat, always, and there are only a slim few variations on what maps do, such as forcing party formations, party sizes, and adding a few buff and debuff squares on the grid. This simplistic map is aggrivated by the fact that the dlc that comes with purchase breaks the first quarter of the game. You can one hit pretty much aything, and if you build your stats in a smart way, you can continue to do so through to the second generation.\n\nThat said, I found the quality of the writing in the game to be engrossing, it borrows ideas from alot of other franchises, but it presents them well, in a storyline that makes sense. The crafting system, for some reason I cannot explain, is redonkulously addictive, it might just be that the blacksmith sometimes makes mistakes, and his goofy mug pops up on the screen when he does so. Most other games, I tend to ignore crafting, but with this game I am compelled to make EVERYTHING. Maybe it is because the game almost completely lacks open world exploration, with some of the few exploration maps being recycled in the "DLC".\n\nI just recently bought this game because it went on sale for a very nice discount, and honestly, the ecchi trailers for it kind of put me off, making me think it was just another gimmick game. The dating sim aspect is actually a fairly pleasant distraction from the grind, however, especially when there is in an incentive for doing well with the female of your choice. (And I dont't mean the ecchi cutscenes) The game is told by generations, and your next generation hero has stats partially dependant on how much love exists between the female the main character from the previous generation. Some people have compained that affection levels go up and down for reasons that make no sense. Such as, you choose to turn left, rather than go right, and one of the girls doesn't like you so much. Some people say this makes no sense, to me, it does, because I have been in the car, on a walk, or on a trip, and taken a right turn instead of left, and gotten the "I wouldn't have gone that way." from the person I was with. Real human emotions sometimes don't make sense.\n\nTHIS GAME IS FOR GRINDERS.\n\nThere is no getting around that fact, unlike other games where you can wonder freely, and encounters happen at random, every point on the world map is a battle point, so even if you are not directly trying to grind, the game forces you to anyway. One day, after a long day at work, I set out on the current stretch of the campaign, and fell asleep at the computer during the middle of a battle, because there were ten map spots to move through before getting to the next EVENT, because the battles, though well animated, are sloooow.\n\nMany other people have mentioned turning up the framerate in the game to 60fps to make it go by quicker, I cannot recommend doing this enough. It vastly speeds the game up, and instead of taking an hour to get to an event, you can quarter that time. I have noticed that some maps seem to force the framerate back to 30fps, especially on exploration maps.\n\nAll in all, I recommend it, but don't expect the battles to be like the ones from Tactics, it's like comparing apples and oranges.\n","January 25, 2015","true","20.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It’s possible that the next four generations in their advertised 5 generations of heroes will change my tune on the following points, but I feel like I’m at a point where I should point a few things out. It feels like there is a really fun game hidden in here somewhere; the characters have nice and varied designs, the dialogue is reasonably entertaining (if a bit cryptic and ambiguous), and I am a fan of turn-based strategy games, but this game has just a few too many problems. first off, the flow of the game is terrible. to get to every event you must first go through 4-7 battle zones and may be rewarded with a mere 10 lines or so of dialogue before they send you through the next zones to the next event. Not only that, but there is never a quick solution to anything, no matter how trivial it seems (like when a rock blocks your path and you enter a full-on battle in order to remove it despite you being able to move your characters behind the rock in the fight itself). “Events” can refer to anything from strategy meetings about how to combat the enemy country, long chains of fights as you attempt to save a city under siege, or (more often than not) a talk with a guy in a city that gives a tiny glimpse of the world you are playing in and then moving on before anything interesting happens. It seems like most of the events could have been combined together so that we don’t run into situations like “Let’s ask the neighboring country for help” *battle your way to next town* “how do we plan on getting to the neighboring country? <player chooses ‘by sea’>” *battle your way to the harbor* “alright, let’s sail to the neighboring country so we can ask them for help” and so on and so forth. If they had combined the events together we probably wouldn’t be stuck in this ridiculous stop-and-go storyline.\n\nSo my main problem with the story is how many fights you have to go through to progress it, so logically if the fighting is fun, then it isn't too bad, right? sadly, it is the most tedious fighting system I have seen in a long time. Every character has an amount of AP to spend which gets added to every turn. these points handle both movement AND usable skills for some reason, so if you want to light off a bunch of attacks at once, then often your best move is to hold still and wait for enemies to be in range. also, if for some reason you need to move your characters (to have a low-hp assassin retreat or something) you need to make sure that the arbitrary formation mechanic isn't going to suddenly screw you over. every character has 5-7 slots relative to their position which, if an ally is standing within those slots, links that character and ally together. Linked characters can use skills on the same enemies at the same time (possibly creating combo moves) and both(/all) linked characters can fly instantaneously across the field if they are too far to use their short-range attacks, but if a character does move like this (or if they even turn around just to face the enemy) then you run the risk of all the rest of your attacks that turn not being linked, which means that any melee units linked to the guy you used to attack with could become pretty much useless unless an enemy stopped right next to them that turn. Sure, it adds a layer of strategy to the game, but it is so needlessly complicated and so punishing when failed that I often have to hold myself back when fighting instead of actually having fun blasting all my combos at the idiot mage who wandered too far ahead of his buddies. This probably would be more bearable if the link-squares were more flexible, like allowing anyone within a square of the highlighted space to become linked or something, but instead there are characters only a single link square that is any to them and the rest are at the very least 5 spaces away (in maybe a 15x15 arena), so to get your entire team linked together, you either need to memorize your units arbitrary link patterns or (more likely) spend lots of time in trial and error every turn moving your units back and forth to find a way to get every character into the link without wasting all their AP.\n\nI mentioned combo moves a few times in the last paragraph, and these could also have livened up the combat if they were done well. perhaps this will change as I get further in the game, but right now, it feels like the pool of skills is miniscule. I have three units with the Rush skill and just as many with Trick Hit (a pair of skills that combines to Vanish Trick), but the thing is, I only have six units and each unit is holding between four and six skills each. I have never even found a place to buy new skills! This all is telling me that there is almost no variety between my characters. It seems like every unit gets a skill or two that you haven’t seen before and the rest of the skills just give you another person to combo with in exactly the same way you have been fighting up until now. Every time I see someone with a new skill I do everything I can to put new skills next to each other in combat to see if I can make new combos show up, but there are so few combos that I pretty much never find anything cool, I just get a bunch of people taking turns to throw their individual attacks at someone, which can take a very long time depending on how many attacks you queued up (even if the opponent dies, the assault will keep going). So the combo system gets a poor grade from me as well.\n\nso despite the nice characters and potentially-interesting story, I haven’t been able to  bring myself to play this game for any extended stretch of time thanks to the overwhelming number of forced encounters in a terrible combat system.\n","February 6, 2014","false","25.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While it's defnitely a pretty game to look at, it can't get past the fact that it's boring as hell. The combat system is flawed beyond repair, and it can't seem to settle on if it wants to be a traditional JRPG (of which I'm a fan), a tactical turn-based RPG (of which I'm a fan), or a "heavy" war epic.\n\nIt can't make up it's mind, and it falls flat.\n\nThe dialogue is hackneyed and predictable, the story even more so. The graphics are the games saving grace, though some of the character designs are questionalbe at best. I can't recommend this game to anyone, unfortunately.

It’s possible that the next four generations in their advertised 5 generations of heroes will change my tune on the following points, but I feel like I’m at a point where I should point a few things out. It feels like there is a really fun game hidden in here somewhere; the characters have nice and varied designs, the dialogue is reasonably entertaining (if a bit cryptic and ambiguous), and I am a fan of turn-based strategy games, but this game has just a few too many problems. first off, the flow of the game is terrible. to get to every event you must first go through 4-7 battle zones and may be rewarded with a mere 10 lines or so of dialogue before they send you through the next zones to the next event. Not only that, but there is never a quick solution to anything, no matter how trivial it seems (like when a rock blocks your path and you enter a full-on battle in order to remove it despite you being able to move your characters behind the rock in the fight itself). “Events” can refer to anything from strategy meetings about how to combat the enemy country, long chains of fights as you attempt to save a city under siege, or (more often than not) a talk with a guy in a city that gives a tiny glimpse of the world you are playing in and then moving on before anything interesting happens. It seems like most of the events could have been combined together so that we don’t run into situations like “Let’s ask the neighboring country for help” *battle your way to next town* “how do we plan on getting to the neighboring country? <player chooses ‘by sea’>” *battle your way to the harbor* “alright, let’s sail to the neighboring country so we can ask them for help” and so on and so forth. If they had combined the events together we probably wouldn’t be stuck in this ridiculous stop-and-go storyline.\n\nSo my main problem with the story is how many fights you have to go through to progress it, so logically if the fighting is fun, then it isn't too bad, right? sadly, it is the most tedious fighting system I have seen in a long time. Every character has an amount of AP to spend which gets added to every turn. these points handle both movement AND usable skills for some reason, so if you want to light off a bunch of attacks at once, then often your best move is to hold still and wait for enemies to be in range. also, if for some reason you need to move your characters (to have a low-hp assassin retreat or something) you need to make sure that the arbitrary formation mechanic isn't going to suddenly screw you over. every character has 5-7 slots relative to their position which, if an ally is standing within those slots, links that character and ally together. Linked characters can use skills on the same enemies at the same time (possibly creating combo moves) and both(/all) linked characters can fly instantaneously across the field if they are too far to use their short-range attacks, but if a character does move like this (or if they even turn around just to face the enemy) then you run the risk of all the rest of your attacks that turn not being linked, which means that any melee units linked to the guy you used to attack with could become pretty much useless unless an enemy stopped right next to them that turn. Sure, it adds a layer of strategy to the game, but it is so needlessly complicated and so punishing when failed that I often have to hold myself back when fighting instead of actually having fun blasting all my combos at the idiot mage who wandered too far ahead of his buddies. This probably would be more bearable if the link-squares were more flexible, like allowing anyone within a square of the highlighted space to become linked or something, but instead there are characters only a single link square that is any to them and the rest are at the very least 5 spaces away (in maybe a 15x15 arena), so to get your entire team linked together, you either need to memorize your units arbitrary link patterns or (more likely) spend lots of time in trial and error every turn moving your units back and forth to find a way to get every character into the link without wasting all their AP.\n\nI mentioned combo moves a few times in the last paragraph, and these could also have livened up the combat if they were done well. perhaps this will change as I get further in the game, but right now, it feels like the pool of skills is miniscule. I have three units with the Rush skill and just as many with Trick Hit (a pair of skills that combines to Vanish Trick), but the thing is, I only have six units and each unit is holding between four and six skills each. I have never even found a place to buy new skills! This all is telling me that there is almost no variety between my characters. It seems like every unit gets a skill or two that you haven’t seen before and the rest of the skills just give you another person to combo with in exactly the same way you have been fighting up until now. Every time I see someone with a new skill I do everything I can to put new skills next to each other in combat to see if I can make new combos show up, but there are so few combos that I pretty much never find anything cool, I just get a bunch of people taking turns to throw their individual attacks at someone, which can take a very long time depending on how many attacks you queued up (even if the opponent dies, the assault will keep going). So the combo system gets a poor grade from me as well.\n\nso despite the nice characters and potentially-interesting story, I haven’t been able to  bring myself to play this game for any extended stretch of time thanks to the overwhelming number of forced encounters in a terrible combat system.\n","February 6, 2014","false","25.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's nothing on hit rate, there's simply nothing!\n\nDuring combat, it's downright impossible to know what choices to make.  You end up dealing with a lot of trial and error, and using characters valued action points, all because you don't know anything.   It's infuriating to overkill an enemy well beyond what's necessary, only for you to have no points to deal with the other enemies on the map.\n\nIn short, you can't formulate effective strategies to quickly overcome the odds.  This makes combat slow and frustrating, to the point you feel like you're not really getting anywhere. It's a chore.\n\nThe only plus to Agarest is the nice artwork. You surely won't find any joy in being a tactician like you'd get in better games.","December 30, 2014","false","8.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But all-in-all, perhaps it's because I'm very much used to simple battle mechanics of Vandal Hearts, Saiyuki, Dynasty Tactics and the lot, I can't get myself to like the battle mechanic presented by this game.\n\nAlthough I'm totally fine with grinding, the battle somewhat played out in (for me) a very bizzare combo and linking system. The concept of this is easy to grasp, but very hard to master, and it's not in a good way, frustrating at it's best. One of the things I'm not content with is that several people need to be positioned in a certain way to link for combos. It's really not a good design, in my point of view, it limits the character's positioning and it creates this weird vulnerability for certain characters that is positioned. Being a player who's familiar with the olden tactics mechanics, the attacks somewhat baffles me, I'm very much used to a person having a melee weapon attacking someone that is adjacent to the particular person and a ranged person with an area of attack, this isn't what is presented in this game. The battle system felt very alien to me and that's the main drawback that I experienced. So if you're looking for a battle system as compared to games such as Dynasty Tactics or Saiyuki, I'd suggest look somewhere else; this game does not provide that.","January 1, 2015","false","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I tend to enjoy grid-based, turn-based strategy games, but this one is just boring. Every battle is fought on map with no terrain. No bushes to give your guys better defence, no walls for you to limit enemy movement with, just and open field. There is a bit of positioning strategy with link squares (if you put your guys in certain squares depending on wheere your other guys are, they can attack together) so there is is some amount of thinking, you don't just run at the bad guys and stab them. Every battle, in addition to having a boring map takes about 5 minutes or so and is pretty easy. The game very well might get harder as you progress but I quit after starting the second generation because it isn't really a strategy game. The standard version gives you a bunch of stuff as free dlc. These weapons are really good in both the first and second generations but every character you doesn't use one of these weapons deals very little damage, making several of the characters you use useless because they don't have the op weapons. Shops also seem pretty useless as every signle shop, as far as I've seen, is exactly the same, progressing through the story doesn't let you buy more powerful weapons.\n\nAll in all, this game is a dating sim disguised as a tactical rpg. You can pick your own waifu every generation and then pick one for the kid in the next generation. The gameplay is very boring and not really worth time investing into, especially for 17 bucks (current price).","August 2, 2015","false","19.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You have three elements of gameplay, which are battles, character interaction/dialouge parts, and city interfaces with creating and improving equipment and other, hardly worth mentioning, things.\n\nThe battles are based on a pretty stupid design decision you get a movement phase and an action phase, both running at the same time for your group and the enemy group leading to fun moments such as "Oh the enemy ran that way and I can't hit him, such fun and totally something I could have done something about!" or in simpler terms they are tedious as ♥♥♥♥.\nThat is if you do not have any of the dlc equipment, though that only makes them less tedious, but I still don't consider them fun or compelling, seeing how all I can do is hope my movement phase got me in the right spot in order to throw all of my AP into abilities in order to kill stuff. Let me elaborate on that, the battles work like this the two phase I mentioned beforehand both use AP in order for you to do stuff, e.g. each field you move during the movement phase costs 1AP, attacking during the Action Phase can only be done with Skills that use AP, with the cheapest one costing 8AP upto a grand 18AP, though that is a special move, in order to put that into relation, with DLC equipment you have 40AP without ~20AP, at least till the point to which I played...\nOverall it felt like a ♥♥♥♥ version of decent strategy rpg battle system, mainly Fire Emblem, it was a pain and little else.\n\nWhile that was all the gameplay for the battles there still is the gameplay for the dialouge, which was the main reason I got the game, hoping it would be fun, it isn't, and I was a fool to think otherwise.\nInstead of elaborating on this I will keep this short and simple, there usually is no way for you to know how any choice affects your alignment or the affection levels of the heroines, e.g. "Which way will we take?" with answers such as "Shortest way!", "Detour!" and "Charging straight through the enemy camp!" I figure you could only predict that the third option seems pretty dark which would be a correct guess but other than that it just felt like lucid guessing to me...\n\nBut even without those choices the dialouge and the characters are pretty annoying, I figure the easiest way would be to put down an example, avoiding spoilers of course. So let us say you and your group of 8 other people walk into a capital of a foreign nation just chilling and ♥♥♥♥, some guy approaches you and initiates a conversation by going "Excuse me?" a pretty normal way to do it, right? Nothing unusual here, right? You would jsut assume he wanted to ask something of you, right? Well not so our merry little group containing at least two almost extinct species (No one gives a ♥♥♥♥ about that either, they just went "Oh a member of an almost extinct race? I don't care!") Immideatly go on asking who the hell the guy is, because ♥♥♥♥ smalltalk...\nWhat I am trying to get at is, all the characters know that everything that happens can only be relevant to the plot, and so should the player if he/she has a no mental illnesess or handicaps, but they still act as if they just dropped some Inception "going deeper" ♥♥♥♥ on you...\n\nThis leads to alot, and I mean A REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING LOT of information that is completly useless, usually you could just skip through it, but not i nthis game, you can't, because while the game does have a skip mode for dialouge you sometimes can't stop in time to get important stuff out of it and there is no way of going back to that text...\nAnd I could put up with that if the skip mode was only another the equivalent of smashing "a" or "space" or whichever button you bound to that, sadly it isn't.\nOutside of the skip mode the game has a pretty annoying screen/character transition. Imagine a movie where every dialouge between characters was shot in a way were only the character currently talking can be seen on camera and the cameraman has to switch inbetween shots, now imagine that with awkward 2~3 second pauses for the transition...\nPer scene of character interaction you have at least 20 seconds of shot transitions... but wait there is more...\n\nEver played a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ RPGMaker game, or seen one? If not, lucky you!\nOne thing those usually use is a "wait order" meaning taking away control over the character for x seconds.\nSo does this game, everytime it wants to get you to realize characters are moving everything except the background, excluding character arts, fades out and you get a footstep sound file, sometimes they even throw in a squeaking door, leading to a record waiting order of 20 seconds, well the record I got prior to quitting and writing this, to a degree hate fuelled, piece of oppinion... by the way skip mode can't skip those either...\n\nTo sum that one up useless information + waiting for scripts is not a good way of conveying information to the player via dialouge, especially if you know the plot without reading the majority of text if you ever watched any anime or read any manga with a medieval fantasy setting, because it is pretty much just that.\n\nSeeing how I lost track of the points I was trying to talk about, I can still guarantee this is better writing than the games writing, if you are really desperate for some interactive games you could go for this one, but I think reading a textbook might be just as much fun with a higher degree of profitableness for your life overall...","January 12, 2015","false","12.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Gives you choices but doesn't change much except the game becomes judgmental of you when you pick one. The characters were not interesting enough as they are shallow minded and childish in nature. the main character choses to accompany a child into battle because she is determined to go with him.

And a growth system that is a great blend of feeling actual progress without giving the farm away after lvl 1.\n\nAssuming you play on "hard," the difficulty curve is a bit unusual, though.  The very beginning is hard because you have so few options.  Once you get to 2nd gen, though; the difficulty drops significantly until the end of the 4th generation.  After that, and through the end of the game, you can no longer power your way through with grinding.  It is mandatory that you develop effective tactics to deal with the punishment that the enemies will unleash.\n\nI strongly recommend you play the  game blind, and take your time.  You will get 100's of hours out of this game that way.  Once you've beat it once, it's good for a min/max playthrough to get the best ending.  After that, the combat is fun enough to come back to occasionally; but like most games, once you figure out the most powerful attacks, it can be hard to stop using them.\n\nThere's an in game rewards system for certain accomplishments (getting $1 mil, 500 hits in one turn, having every weapon, etc), which is actually pretty fun to go after (if you are not trying for the good ending).  The alchemy/weapon/armor/accessory building system is deep.  Not only can you build different (1000's) of weapons, armor, accessories, and items -- each with their own strengths and weakensses; but you can level those weapons up, and even break them down into ingredients necessary for the most powerful weapons and armors.  It's truly a system that requires a great amount of planning to get the most out of.\n\nAnd for those who like the capture aspects of games, this game has it.  Many of the advanced monsters you can get are actually worthwhile.  I can't say much about this, as I'm not a big fan of capturing monsters in general; but it is an excellently implemented system.\n\nAnd finally, there are tons of easter eggs.  Not only the sexy kind, but additional dungeons, and uber enemies to challenge once you feel like a master.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about this game is how to get the "right" ending.   I liken it to Chrono Cross.  You either had to get the knowledge from an external source, or go through the game a dozen times to figure out how to get the ending that actually ends the game.  And worse, you cannot procede with the relationships that are most obvious, or appeal to you the most if you want to see the ending.  And you have to rush the game in order to see the actual ending.  You have to finish each generation in less than so many turns.  Don't get me wrong, you can do all those things, you just won't get the ending that actually ends the game.\n\nHonestly, there's not a lot to not like about this game.  Add to it that you can tranfer your data directly to the two sequels and you have a whole lot of game for your buck.  I beat these games years and years ago on consol, so I know them much better than my 152 hours would suggest.\n\nThe port is fine.  I really have had 0 issues with it at all.  10/10 for the port, and 9/10 for the game.","April 30","true","151.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game takes place over several generations.  It would have been nice to see the world evolve as time passes.  Unfortunately, that never happens and the world is very much static despite the hundred year gap from start to end (give or take, the game never really mentions how much time passes).  The whole generations thing boils down to the ability to determine the stats/abilities of the main hero of each generation through which brides you pick.\n\nThe rest of the story isn't much to speak of.  It is all fairly generic stop the evil forces plot.  This isn't helped by the characters that are all one-note and there are no surprises along the way.  Most of the characters even completely lose their reason for joining in the first place once the generation they join in is over; most of them follow you to further generations because "reasons."  The brides of each generation aren't helped that you know the second they join that their purpose is to fall for the hero (the degree of which depends on mostly dialogue choices) to create the next hero.\n\nThe combat could make up for all of that but it has its own issues.  At the start of the game you begin with some end game items for whatever reason that trivialize the first couple generations.  If used, you won't get the chance to understand how to fully use the combat, but if not used battles can take forever to finish (I played on Hard).\n\nTo properly fight in this game, you need to constantly use your links.  Basically, every character has link spots in set patterns from where they are.  If another character is on that space, you can attack with them when either character's turn comes up plus you can combine their abilities for considerably more damage.  You can link your entire team like that and this becomes mandatory later on, especially for bosses.  It gives the game some strategy but enemies can counter the entire mechanic by killing characters (easily done in single attacks on Hard) or using abilities with knock back, both of which can ruin your links.\n\nThere was a lot of potential going into this game but every aspect of the story falls flat and the combat can take forever even discounting enemies ruining your big damage moves.  At least grinding isn't necessary (unless you want to level up a previously unused character which isn't too bad) and once things are properly set up in battles, you can take out bosses in one giant attack.","May 22","false","106.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The reason why I still bought it in the end were the positive reviews, where almost everyone with a (seemingly) sense for this kind of games said it is still worth it.\n\nAfter picking it up and playing some: I have to disagree! I am used to grinding a lot, I am used to face the same enemies in a row for some battles. But I am definitely not used to what this game wanted to do to me. The battles got repetitive after the second one! Yes, the second battle after the tutorial was already: "Oh, exactly the same enemies ... well, I guess I will do the same thing as last time then ..."\n\nThis is a really bad omen. But I continued, having glanced at the combination-system in battles, the item-upgrading and stuff and the character development.\n\nI also had some weapons from some DLC's or so (The game doesn't tell you anything...) which were 10x as powerful as your other stuff. Which means I kept onehitting everything (I play on hard) with the characters that can equip such a weapon and couldn't deal any damage with all the other characters. I now know those weapons can be disabled, but seriously? This is such bad design, it is stunning!\n\nThere are issues on so many levels with the game that I really can't recommend it to even the biggest JRPG-fan. The combat-system has some potential, but the way you should be slowly approaching this potential is done so horribly wrong, I am not even interested in encountering this part of the game anymore. And that doesn't happen a lot with me. The story itself seems okay to me, however the way you interact with it is strange. Sometimes your girls ask you which one you like more. No problems in determining how each one of them reacts. But there are other decisions where you (as you don't really know enough) just decide something and then ".... ah, she likes me more. No idea why, but it said affection up WOW".\n\nThe next thing is the weird look. I don't know who had the idea to have the characters in a 2d pixel-style and the surroundings in a 3D modern look. With very poor details, by the way. It would help (and probably be a lot easier to make even) to have this consequent. By the way, this grass / wood- type area you fought in in the tutorial in a forest (where it makes sense) will reappear anywhere. Unless you are in a cave, then the area is in a cave and rocky. However, the are always looks the same. Oh, you were on a road, let me make that a forest clearing for you so we can use this area again. Really, this played a huge part in the repetitive feeling I got after some fights.\n\nI am going to play some more tens of hours of Ogre battles now because that is how you do tactical and challenging combat with options! Or Fire Emblem, because I feel that even this brings me to care for the characters a lot more than agarest did. Which, in the end, is one of the worst things that can happen in such a game.\n\nOverall, I can't really explain why I feel this bad about Agarest. Maybe because I was doubting first, then decided to go for it and am pretty disappointed now. Maybe the points I listed are really all big flaws or the game just doesn't suit me. I just feel that there are better JRPGs concerning combat, better ones concerning the overall story and plot and especially better ones in making me care about my characters. Which, as I said before, is normally where the incentive in those games lies.","October 1, 2014","false","21.4"," 67 of 137 people (49%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","49","67","137","6","12"

Moreover I'm a fan of so many of the things this game does: lots of playable characters, decisions having consequences later on, rewarding well-fought battles with xp and gold bonuses, an expansive crafting system. I could go on.  I even enjoyed interacting with other characters to raise their bond with the PC.  The end goal being breeding was a little off-putting but the multigenerational nature of the game is an interesting hook.\n\nHowever, and it's a big fat hairy however, the two big main things happening in any game are the story and the core gameplay mechanics.\n\nI enjoy this type of combat, like, a lot.  So I found myself so surprised that I got so bored of it so quickly.  Every battle feels the same and there are so many battles.  Worst of all your characters equipment and skills change at a glacial pace.  It felt like hours between having that warm fuzzy feeling of getting something new and wanting to try it out in battle.  You can't even spend time grinding to craft better stuff because the game takes away the best ending if you take too long.  Oh, and when you do get new skills or equipment?  Your strategy doesn't even really change that much.\n\nAs for story there's not much I can say.  This is the kind of bad generic fantasy story that makes cooking oatmeal look like a spectator sport.  On top of that all the characters and their interactions with one another are a grab bag of the laziest anime stereotypes and tropes.  There is nothing to enjoy between battles except going to towns and staring sadly at all of the stuff you can't craft.\n\nTL;DR The story seems to actively encourage you to ignore it and if you do then the game becomes a single fight repeated ad nauseum.\n\n","October 3, 2014","false","78.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It commits two cardinal sins: the first is that its DLCs are almost entirely game-breaking power boosts, not additional content; the second is that the gameplay is largely dull and grinding. The game has some interesting mechanics: multiple characters being able to link attacks to form combos and special super attacks, a monster capturing mechanic that lets you combine monsters together to form new monsters, and an item crafting system.\n\nUnfortunately these are marred by the fact that through much of the game (and even more shockingly, through much of the first chapter) you are forced to slog through a series of uninteresting, and unthreatening, fights. These are there to grind your characters levels, and try out attack combinations in preparation for the much more interesting boss fights I assume, but they turn the game's interesting battle system into a laborious chore.\n\nThat being said, you might enjoy this game if you liked games like Disgaea for the grinding aspects of their gameplay, but for most people (and I assume even most fans of games like Disgaea) grind is not a selling point. If you think that Disgaea, with its humour stripped out and replaced with a choose-your-own-adventure style dating sim, sounds appealing to you then by all means give Agarest: Generations of War a purchase.

It is NOT intuitive, however, and I can see it being very confusing.\n-The Character Design is pleasant to me from a purely visual point of view.  Pretty guys and girls abound.  You will notice that women wear far less clothes than men.\n\nThe Cons:\n-DLC ruins the experience.  I ended up restarted the game when I found out I had a ton of overpowered equipment that makes everything a cakewalk.  I didn't even know I had DLC.\n-The game seems to suggest you have choice to shape the characters, but it's more or less a choice of adventure path.  After playing Bioware games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age or even Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, the amount of control you have over personality is negligible and seems only to decide what extra cutscenes and endings you are allowed to see.  Pick the wrong thing and you get nothing.\n-The battle system, though fun, was tedious when the battles do not matter.  The auto-battle AI is abysmal.\n\nThe Verdict: If you want a solid strategy RPG that has good character design, no real character choice, and fun mechanics, then find yourself a Disgaea(PS2/PS3).  Any will do.  They're all better games.  If you want a game with choice: look up Dragon Age, Mass Effect, Star Wars KOTOR, or Witcher 2. Those are better games.  If you want to watch characters grow up after a generation based on romantic decisions, go play Fire Emblem: Awakening(3DS). It is a better game.","January 5, 2015","false","7.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This game has a solid story and interesting mechanics as far as romance (cause let's face it, that's why you're here).  The characters are likeable (thank god, too many of these have 2D characters) and you actually get invested in the story.\n\nThe reason I have to qualify this, and the big reason this review is a no, is the combat.  The majority of the game is combat and the way it's done is unintuitive, clunky, and not very well thought out.  When you have to include cheat items in the game to make it more bearable, it's not good game design.  If combat was just a way to move the story along (ie: Loren), this wouldn't pose as much of an issue.  But the game is 99% grinding, which is extremely strange in anything other than an MMO.  This is not an overstatement or hypberbole, there is more grinding in this game than most MMOs you played when you were in middle school back when you didn't know better.\n\nIf you think you can sit through the awful combat and the repetitive frustrating battles go ahead.  The story is good enough that it can make it worth a shot, but to many it will be a wall that makes this game inaccessible.","November 26, 2015","false","3.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I don't play them often, but when I do, I tend to play them to the end. Which says a lot. I rarely play any game to the end no matter the genre. Agarest is testing my patience in this reguard and that makes me sad. So far I've only played about 2 1/2 hours, but I had to push myself to get this far. The story is arbitrary and dosen't make a ton of sense. Fights are repetative. They are played out over a checker board with a back drop that never changes. There seems to be no free roaming, you move from one orange point to the next clearing the same 3 monsters on each point. I prepurchased the game to get the DLC for free and found out the DLC is uber powerful weapons with no restrictions. I'm going to give this game a little more time to see if it matures into something motivative, but if you're the type who wouldn't want to invest at least 3 hours of dull and sometimes confusing gameplay to a game that may or may not pay off, then stay away.","October 7, 2013","false","2.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Too bad, this game really had potential.\n\nI was so enthusiastic about it that I purchased Generations of War *AND* Zero, but I didn't even bother playing the other one because the entire experience is ruined by the amazingly poor dating sim element.

However, the dating sim element completely ruined it for me. It's bad and mainly focused on getting, lets say, "naughty images" of girl X, Y or Z. Too bad, this game really had potential.\n\nI was so enthusiastic about it that I purchased Generations of War *AND* Zero, but I didn't even bother playing the other one because the entire experience is ruined by the amazingly poor dating sim element. I thought I could overlook it but it's disturbingly out there in every single story scenario. Games like the latest Fire Emblem for 3ds did that much better (regarding combining fantasy with romance/generations etc.)\n\nWould definitely not recommend *because* of the dating sim element.

Here's why!\n\n1) It's a very lazy port - there are no graphics options to tweak the game for performance on your computer (though the game does have very small overheads in that department anyway). There has also been no optimisation of the user interface for the keyboard/mouse interface paradigm. A gamepad would be the best choice if you MUST play this game.\n\n2) The process of storytelling moves very slowly! This is the result of the harebrained decision to have the screen pan in and out of the operative sprite on EVERY SINGLE LINE. That is, even if a character is speaking several lines in sequence, the game's frame will pan into the sprite at the start of the line and away from it at the end of the line. Rinse and repeat.\n\n3) The discontinuity between the plot sections and the battle sections can be very jarring. As an example, there's an early mission where you come across a boulder in the road, blocking your path ahead. Your characters decide to smash it up to get through and into battle mode you go. However, once you're in battle mode, the entire landscape has changed - and it is clear that you could simply have walked around the boulder (due to the very repetitive, if not entirely uniform battle terrain).\n\nIn short, it would probably work OK on consoles (though no amount of gamepad controllers could fix poor design choices like #3) - but it's just not right for PC.\n\nIf you're looking for a recent quality strategy role-playing game out of Japan that incorporates dating sim elements and quality voice acting, look no further than Fire Emblem: Awakening for the 3DS. That game does everything that Agarest tries to do - and does it far better.\n\nRating: 4/10.","October 4, 2013","false","4.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/237890/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","A tyrannical nation is invading a smaller, less militarized country in order to eliminate its citizens. You are a hero trying to save that country, by reaching out to potential allies and fighting the good fight on the frontline. By battling monsters and enemy soldiers, the hero grows stronger with each skirmish, gaining more and more confidence along the way. But the war is still ongoing and the longer it drags on, more innocents will be exposed to the pain and suffering that accompanies it.\n\nSo why am I currently sitting in a hot spring trying to woo over my female companions? Isn’t there a bloody war going on? Shouldn’t we be helping people? Geez, we must have a lot of spare time on our hands. No wonder the war has lasted this long.\n\nDeveloped by Compile Heart out of Japan, Agarest: Generations of War is a strategy-RPG that follows five generations of male protagonists as they seek to bring peace to the world. Each hero is confronted with a new quest that in some way causes chaos, and he goes on a journey to gather companions and solve the problem at hand. Very traditional fantasy tropes and clichés are present throughout the story, yet it is not so much of a detriment as it is an expectation. If you were looking for an innovative and original story, please continue your search for another game that will satisfy your definitions.\n\nYet what Agarest lacks in terms of story it makes up for in how it is structured. Put simply, as you play through the game you have to romance and win over the hearts of at least one of your female companions in each generation. Whomever you choose in each generation affects both how the next protagonist will look like and what kind of character archetype they operate under. Romance a rogue in the first generation and the protagonist in the second generation will wear a red suit of armor and wield daggers in battle. And since Agarest contains multiple fantasy races, including multiple kinds of elves, your children will inherit characteristics of those races should you choose one of them for marriage.\n\nIt is a great, albeit limited feature that helps Agarest stand out from other RPG’s currently on the market. But one of the main difficulties that I encountered when reviewing the game stems from the dating sim elements that are incorporated into the story. Agarest contains content, especially during the romance scenes, that could be classified as erotic. Now in practice, the most erotic content that can be found within the game is a shot of cleavage or female characters wearing skimpy outfits that have no practical use. It’s most definitely not a game that could be rated PG, yet it’s not even close to being called a porn game.\n\nSo what’s the problem with that? If the content is not pornographic, why do you need to worry? Because by not tilting to one extreme or the other, Agarest ends up feeling like it’s trying to have the best of both worlds. It wants to be edgy, but also wants to be tame in order to obtain a larger audience. This means that the more adult scenes ended up feeling extremely childish, and makes them laughable in their attempts to be mature.\n\nBeyond the romantic elements within the game, Agarest is from top to bottom your classic strategy RPG. You move around the world map via nodes that connect towns and fields together, and you enter battles either through random encounters in dungeons or entering battle nodes that are found on the map. Battles themselves are based around chaining together attacks between allies in order to create special combo attacks that deal more damage or to simply use as many attacks as possible to eliminate an enemy quickly. It’s functional combat that encourages experimentation and repetition in order to hone your skills. More often than not, however, I found myself rushing through battles in order to experience more of what the story has to offer.\n\nUnfortunately, the story happens to move at an extremely slow pace. Whenever I encountered a story node in the first act for example, I received anywhere from one to five minutes of talking before being forced to spend 15 minutes in battles in order to reach the next cut scene. If the story didn’t move like a sloth, I would be far more inclined to enjoy the battles which make up the core of the game.\n\nAnother detriment to the battle system is the incredibly lackluster terrain in which you fight on. Every map is on a flat grid with no height or terrain advantages to speak of, meaning everyone fights on the same flat plain no matter what. And while the background may change from say a forest to a mountain every so often, it doesn’t help the fact that it remains remarkably boring. The characters and their sprites themselves are far more detailed, and they remain a constant positive at every point in the game.\n\nAgarest: Generations of War has an interesting central concept that never manages to create anything special with the tools it has available. While the dating sim portions of the game do succeed, even if they are overly awkward, the slow pace of the storyline combined with a lack of clear innovation does more harm than good. But, if you want to play an RPG that will last you an extremely long time, and are unconcerned with its pace, then you could do far worse than this.\n\nSlightly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 24, 2014","true","38.6"," 27 of 61 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","27","61","0","0"

Gotta get some of that...!\nToday I tried to give a try again and I still get the same feeling that if I used the money to blow my nose would been more worth it.\n\nLet's start with the praises that can be counted on the fingers I have left from my angry chewing session. The voice acting was good, and so was the art. That was it.\n\nNow, keep in mind that for every thing I say, it comes with " But I really wanted to like this game", alright? Because I REALLY wanted to. This is the kind of game I would love to spend hours on, but it is unbearable how poorly optimized it is.\n\nThe games comes with tons of game breaking bonus packs with items. Apparently it was because the grinding was so dull on the consoles they\n\ninstead of balancing it just threw items on the easy route. I didn't get on\n\nthe first time and had to look up, so tell me, what is the point of fights anyway if you have to choose between boring grinding and don't mind the fights at all?\n\nSpeaking of fights, a lot of them are scripted, so it is really just to kill time, one of the first ones in the game stops and it turns out the monster is there to protect the girl you saved earlier. Geez, wouldn't you be a nice help when I was being ganged up!? What were you doing when she was about to die twice? Taking a ♥♥♥♥?\n\nThe game teaches you the basics on the first fight, except that there is no advice on how to distribute your attributes besides common rpg logic. But some things are not made clear, like what exactly defines the range you see that allows to make combos with other characters, so you pretty much have to click on every movement and figure out from there, but don't bother much since you'll barely notice any bonus and the first 3/4 battles are you alone and moving becomes pointless.\n\nThe interface is bad, they give items and spells that you have to click on each one of them, go to another window, and see how much damage they do and you can't skip cutscenes you already saw.\n\nUnlike say, the fist FFT, you have a 3d environment but you can't rotate or anything, and the game tries to show how effort they made with the 3d technology by making you walk on some maps with nothing much to do.\n\nI started a new game when trying to get this review, saying "I'll be open headed and try not remember how bad my experience with it was" and the game took my words too seriously and doesn't let me go to my first save file, showing me it is there but locking me in going straight to the second.\n\nI wish I could get to the next generation but after a certain time I figured that even if it had a hentai scene after a deep emotional resolution that could win an oscar, it still wouldn't be worth it.\n\nSo no, can't recommend, I deleted it from my computer, and pray that my monitor is out of my punch range every time I see it on my steam game list.\n\nNote: The second battle (after a lot of info dump) is a 1x3, So if you put on hard trusting the game saying combat is more enjoyable, and you didn't figure out some extra skills only appear if you have the required AP for it, good luck with that.","April 11, 2015","false","4.4"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

Overall graphic quality resambles the old Final Fantasy Tactics as it's not its strong point, it's definetly amazing and very beautiful, music is good and the characters are the best part, each character has it's own body display in battle and the field and also a very well made anime-like image each time they interact, making this a hard to miss for anime lovers.\n\nThe game itself worth the money to be honest, it's fun, adictive and has A LOT of dlc's that actually do nothing but they look cool.\n\nMetascore: 75/100 "Anime fans, this game it's for you"","January 13, 2014","true","107.8"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

Yes, I do love usually love this genre.\n\n**Edit**\nI wanted to make my review a little more useful.\nStory - low calibur graphic novel at best (just read a comic, you will feel better) Plot advancement is connect the dots super mario world style. Each dot is a boring battle and sometimes a dialgoue. Move from dot to dot = whole game.\nCombat - About moving in a or into a certain formation, has VERY LITTLE to do with real tactics. While you can say moving in a formation is a tactic, I think not. Tactics require "carefully planned" actions, and moving in a certain way *every* time isnt very thoughtful. The fact you can turn left and your well oiled killing machine group can no longer combo is stupid to me. "You have turned left versus facing forward, you no longer can combo with anyone due to the direction you are facing. And it is impossible for you to face forward and attack the enemy on your left hand side while doing this combo as well" . I love turned based games too.","December 6, 2013","false","5.9"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

When I say same, I mean the terrain you fight on is ALWAYS the same flat landscape with no terrain bonuses or higher ground or anything interesting like that.\nThese turn based battles are mind numbingly boring, where the idea is to place your 6 team members on various "strategic" locations on the squares in order to link attacks together with other team members to perfom combos that damage your opponents. It's the same everytime if you use the same field.\nThe big issue with this battle system is the lack of strategy and the repetitive and boring nature of looking through a text list at attack combos and trying to remember what attack goes well with what to perfom combos that do more damage than your weak one hit attacks. Eventually you write a text list which you have to change all the time because looking at the in-game combo book is a chore it itself... does this even sound fun? The crafting and item management process is a chore too.\nThe game story is presented with pictures and japanese language voices, I found no option for english voices. I found this disappointing and turned the voices off.\nI did find the game to have some very nice graphics in battle and many great sound effects, but the music was forgettable.\nI also found that trying to concentrate on this game to beat it will make you lose your mind.\nStay away, there are better games to waste your life on.","January 13, 2015","false","138.2"," 28 of 67 people (42%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","42","28","67","9","16"

I promise. Now let me explain why I'm SO ♥♥♥♥ING ANGRY AT IT.\n\nIt's probably the closest thing to Fire Emblem that you can get in terms of the art, gameplay and genre. Otherwise, go get XCOM. The characters are cute, and the dialogue is funny in that weirdly-translated sort of way... it's not a unique story, and the characters are nothing new, but the silliness of it kind of helps you engage with it. The DLC is probably really good for a second run through the game, because it makes the first portion of it unfairly easy, thus you can get to the more challenging and strategically demanding sections of the game in a smaller amount of time. But, eventually it does even out, and it's gradual, so it's not like you're unprepared for when the difficulty becomes reasonable again.\n\nThe battles can get kind of boring, and I just discovered (after nearly 100 hours playing) that you can skip the animation of the moves by pressing B on an X360 controller (I haven't been using mouse and keyboard at all) which keeps the battles to a more reasonable length.\n\nHOWEVER. Save constantly. It will not be necessary 99% of the time, but if you only save when you know you're about to have a tough fight, that one surprise encounter that kills you can set you back hours. Like the five hours I just wasted because I didn't save before a fight that I had NO IDEA WAS COMING.\n\nPros:\nCute\nApparently engaging enough to spend 100+ hours on\nEngages your sense of strategy decently well\nWomen (and dudes, if that's your thing) in revealing dress\n\nNot sure if pro or con:\nThe dialogue is incredibly silly, and not necessarily on purpose\nIt's really, really long...\nDLC is super OP for first section of the game\n\nCons:\nNo autosave\nNothing graphics-wise that couldn't have been done on the PS2\nNo ♥♥♥♥ING autosave\nGeneric story\nI'M NOT KIDDING ABOUT THAT AUTOSAVE, IF.\n\nFr srs, if you got this in a sale at some point, have at it.

There's "waypoints" you have to walk along~ no free exploration.\nFurther, in the instances where you can actually control the player as a character that moves accross terrain, you'll  find that the areas are shoddily done - and that exploration is very tedious because there's invisible blockades which make you walk back and forth while triggering many very annoying "surprise battles" which you can't skip.\n\nCombat can, unfortunately, not be sped up either~\nI figured that maybe there was an option to speed up animation speed or at least disable the text-overlay animations to speed it up ... but there is no such thing.\n\nFor me: It's too tedious to play.","August 10, 2014","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's nothing you couldn't get from the previews. And you have dialogue choices which affect some of your party members opinion of you as well. That's interesting and good in the sense that many JRPG's are quite linear.\n\nThe problem as I see it, is that this game is so repetitive. Every dot on the map is an encounter. So to go from point A to point B, you might have 5 encounters. Unfortunately, these encounters are largely simple and homogeneous and time consuming. I was itching for a autoresolve button.\n\nSo twenty minutes could go by, and all you've done is essentially the same fight, five times...","June 24, 2014","false","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is set accross 5 generations, and throughout each generation your character and his allies battle against the forces of darkness. Each generation also has 3 potential romantic interests for your character, and as you go along your interactions with them and the choices you make affect their levels of affection towards you.\n\nAt the end of each generation you pick a woman to marry and have a son. This is called the Soul Breed system, and it's an interesting and unique mechanic that I have never encountered in a game before. Basically each generation's character's looks, weapon, abilities and even stats will change depending on who you chose as your wife in the previous generation, their stats, and how much they liked you when you married them.\n\nWhile the turn based combat system can be a bit tedious at times, I found the storyline more than made up for it and was quite interesting. I understand that this game definitely isn't for everyone, but if you like JRPGs and you think that you'll enjoy this game, you probably will and should therefore buy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/recommended/237890/","zombkraken","THE KRAKEN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/","453 products in account","And we’re back with another thrilling review (I wish). Agarest: Generations of War is a turn-based, tactical JRPG from Idea Factory. With a bit of polishing, this game could have been very fun, but, such as it is, it was rather lackluster.\n\n\nThe Good\n\nWhen I first started playing A:GoW I was thinking “Hey, this might be a good one.” Sadly this was not the case. That being said, there was one particular aspect of the game that I enjoyed. In battle, once you had sufficiently weakened an attacking monster, you could use spells to capture it and win it over to your side. From that point forward, you could include it in your party and use it to do battle with your enemies. Now, this is probably just the Pokemon fan in me still (Cthulhu bless those wonderful Gameboy games), but I LOVE when games have a feature like this.\n\nAdditionally, once you had captured at least two monsters, you could take them to the “Monster Guild” and combine them. This had the possibility of giving you a new monster.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThis wasn’t my first experience with a JRPG, so I knew to not expect the best translated dialogue that the world had to offer. Some of it though, was just laughably bad. Multiple scenes sounded like a pretentious play written, directed, and starred in by a high school drama club. Honestly.\n\nWaiting for your party to appear on the battlefield also became incredibly tedious after your first few battles. Once you have six party members and you have to wait a good ten seconds for everyone to appear every battle (and there are many, many battles) you start to think of what else you could be playing right now. (For example, I found myself switching to Skyrim).\n\nApart from this, menus were clunky, somethings during combat would work sometimes, but then not work later, and the list goes on.\n\nThe Meh\n\nThis is another game where the art (specifically the character sprites) got me interested. Ogre Battle 64 is one of my all time favorite games and, if you’re familiar with the Ogre Battle series, the sprites are very much akin to the sprites in A:GoW. Sadly, that’s about where my interest stopped. Additional in game art was either dated 3D rendering or came straight from an anime dating sim.\n\nVerdict: Nay\n\nI believe I got this one of of Humble Bundle, so I can say that I didn’t waste a lot of money on it. For those of you who are considering it though, be wary. But, if you’re a fan of JRPGs, you’ll probably like this one. As always, thanks for reading.","August 7, 2015","false","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hikariws/recommended/237890/","hikariws","Hikari.ws","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hikariws/","56 products in account","If you don't know Agarest yet, it's a turn-based tatic JRPG merged with date simulation.\n\nBattles happen in turns in which each char has an amount of Action Points to use moving and attacking. Not used AP is saved for next turn, till a cap of 2x basic AP. Battles aren't repetitive at all, because in each one the enemies are in different positions. Each char has his own special tiles relative to his own, we position chars based on these special tiles so that they can attack in sequence.\n\nSkills can be combined for combos, for that skills can come from the same char or from different chars attacking together. Combos are much more powerful than normal skills, so positioning is very important. When attacking, a char may move, which can break positions and require repositioning, that makes planning even more important.\n\nScenarios are 3D and chars are 2D sprites. Sometimes we have sequence of battles that we must handle with no free healing or rezzing or possibility to leave. Sometimes we must walk in 3D areas where the same survivability restrictions are imposed.\n\nThe game has a good story worth watching. Story progresses between 2 or 3 battles, they alternate very well to avoid we getting bored. Story happens by showing HD sprites of chars in front of nice 2D scenarios. We have good jap voices subbed in english, BIG point for leaving original voices intact at the same time we can understand everything!!\n\nThere is a little date simulation. Instead of most novels that we just click a button and watch a linear story, here we have an actual game to play. The game has 5 generations (I'm on 2nd), on which the protagonist meets 3 girls who fell in love for him. During story we must make choices that get the girls more or less attracted to the protagonist. In the end of each generation, we must choose one of the girls we are enough attracted, the protagonist marries her and they have a son, that will be protagonist of next generation. The protagonist and the 3 girls leave the game, while other chars remain. We have good variety of girls, in body and personality, and we get attached to them during the story.\n\nIn general I really liked the game, it's a very good merge of interactive RPG with date simulation.\n\nThere are some cons:\n\n- Even with only 2 battles between events and battles being somehow different, I still get bored of them and don't find me playing more than 3 per day. That may be good though, so I don't spend too much time on the game.\n\n- Story is too slow paced. Some parts could be cut out without losing anything. Having battles between events, story gets even slower, they should really not have made the game so big.\n\n- There are too many chars, leading to not having space for all of them talk in every event. Sometimes they just show up with a unique speach of little relevance, just to remember they exist. Vashtor in example, appears on the begining of generation 2, we're never told his origins or why he's chosen to stay on the team, and the rare moments he says something it has no relevance. It seems he was added at a late development iteration to fill a battle hole and the story was already finished.\n\n- Plot is too innocent. It's not because it's a fantasy world that it must seem aimed to kids. Some USA cartoons have plot more complex than this one.\n\n- Some girls are very pretty and we're not allowed to choose them to marry. Ellis-chan is by far the best and I can't choose her. Choices are hardly related to seduce the girls and the protagonist does nothing at all to justify they falling in love for him, or even to get the team accepting him as their leader. Team is just loyal to him and girls are in love, just like that.\n\n- The game requires grinding. There are P2W DLÇs available, I got 1 when I bought the package of 3 games, and still I feel the need for grinding. There's not also the possibility of tanking, I frequently have my lovely Ellis-chan getting killed and nobody can protect her at all. Due to positioning and her moving when going to attack, I can't keep her far enough from enemies. There should have at least a taunt skill.\n\n- Instead of just getting to the next shop and buying better gear, we have some guys on town that can build stuff for us, and we must get books that teach them how to build. Seems a cool idea, but was badly implemented. Most books are just bought on the neightboor shop anyway, it'd be better if we'd find them somewhere or earn them somehow. Once I get my team equiped on the begining of the generation or when I get a new char, I hardly find a better gear for them. At first I thought it was due to the P2W DLÇ, but now my gear is getting weak and I can't find anything better, I can't find anything new at all!!\n\n- Some scenes deserved animation. Story events aren't animated, they are just the HD 2D sprite with different faces and arm positions. Sometimes the story requires movement, and the game simply have no feature to illustrate that. Generally they solve it by not having the action on screen and having a nice sound to make us imagine it happening.\n\nUpdate: with 46h of gameplay I reached generation 3. It seems to be gonna be fun, but battles are getting too hard even with 1 DLÇ I earned when bought the game. So I'm gonna restart it and play on easy mode and following a guide to unlock all content.","June 25, 2015","true","54.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One on the PS3, one on Steam. I had over a thousand hours on this game on the PS3 before I bought my Steam copy.\n\nThis is a great game, very much a strategy styled game and has a lot of story elements. Do be aware that the true ending can be quite difficult to get if you don't have some sort of guide telling you how. Without a guide, expect to spend a few hundred hours figuring out what you need to do to obtain it.  (Even if you don't read a guide, I recommend at least knowing what the turn requirements for true ending is).\n\nBut would I say that I didn't enjoy spending a lot of time grinding and figuring things out? Rather than not enjoying it, I'd say that I enjoyed it.

That's interesting and good in the sense that many JRPG's are quite linear.\n\nThe problem as I see it, is that this game is so repetitive. Every dot on the map is an encounter. So to go from point A to point B, you might have 5 encounters. Unfortunately, these encounters are largely simple and homogeneous and time consuming.

I can only manage about three or so battles per session, then I get worn out and have to go play something else. There's a lot of encounters between each plot event. As well, most of the mechanics only come into play after 10+ hours of playing (like a lot of the stuff at the Adventurer's Guild, Monster Hunting, and most of the crafting). So, if you're not willing to spend time on this one, DON'T BUY IT.\n\nWith that said, I find the actual battle system pretty entertaining, if repetitive at times. Organizing your characters and smacking down enemies is pretty satisfying, even if it sometimes takes a few turns to set up. I love the customizability of the characters' movesets and the ability to link combos together, as well as the Overkilling mechanic in the game. The art is pretty nice (although some of the female characters' outfits... really? I guess it is a JRPG but still...) and the story, while complex, isn't that bad. I'm looking forward to the whole generation mechanic, assuming I ever get there.\n\nOverall, if you're willing to sink like 100 hours into this game, you could do worse.

You have some clumsy flirtation with possible romance partners as you progress through the game.\n\nYour traits from BOTH parents matter in the long run and affect your future children. The soul breed system is what makes this game truly stand out.\n\nIf you are an anime fan or tactics game fan then it's certainly worth a try. Cool combos, somewhat interesting story if you can follow it (it can get slow) and quite a few likeable characters which shocked me.\n\nBe warned howver...This is traditional JRPG GRINDFEST at times.

Agarest: Generations of War is a turn-based, tactical JRPG from Idea Factory. With a bit of polishing, this game could have been very fun, but, such as it is, it was rather lackluster.\n\n\nThe Good\n\nWhen I first started playing A:GoW I was thinking “Hey, this might be a good one.” Sadly this was not the case. That being said, there was one particular aspect of the game that I enjoyed. In battle, once you had sufficiently weakened an attacking monster, you could use spells to capture it and win it over to your side. From that point forward, you could include it in your party and use it to do battle with your enemies. Now, this is probably just the Pokemon fan in me still (Cthulhu bless those wonderful Gameboy games), but I LOVE when games have a feature like this.\n\nAdditionally, once you had captured at least two monsters, you could take them to the “Monster Guild” and combine them. This had the possibility of giving you a new monster.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThis wasn’t my first experience with a JRPG, so I knew to not expect the best translated dialogue that the world had to offer. Some of it though, was just laughably bad. Multiple scenes sounded like a pretentious play written, directed, and starred in by a high school drama club. Honestly.\n\nWaiting for your party to appear on the battlefield also became incredibly tedious after your first few battles. Once you have six party members and you have to wait a good ten seconds for everyone to appear every battle (and there are many, many battles) you start to think of what else you could be playing right now. (For example, I found myself switching to Skyrim).\n\nApart from this, menus were clunky, somethings during combat would work sometimes, but then not work later, and the list goes on.\n\nThe Meh\n\nThis is another game where the art (specifically the character sprites) got me interested. Ogre Battle 64 is one of my all time favorite games and, if you’re familiar with the Ogre Battle series, the sprites are very much akin to the sprites in A:GoW. Sadly, that’s about where my interest stopped. Additional in game art was either dated 3D rendering or came straight from an anime dating sim.\n\nVerdict: Nay\n\nI believe I got this one of of Humble Bundle, so I can say that I didn’t waste a lot of money on it. For those of you who are considering it though, be wary. But, if you’re a fan of JRPGs, you’ll probably like this one. As always, thanks for reading.","August 7, 2015","false","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only problem I've got is that there are far too many glitches. One that I have observed that really pisses me off way more often than it should is that if I even play for 15 minutes at a time, every menu that I can scroll through will continue to move upwards until it has either reached the top or will continue to spin infinately. It forces me to have to quickly save the game (because the same glitch applies on the save menu) and restart the game. It is not too unreasonable for the amount of free content were given though so therefor I give this game 7/10. That glitch needs to be fixed.\n\n(part 2: after playing more of the game)\n\nAfter dealing with the previous glitch for an insurmountable amount of time, and attempting to stomach the garbage that the game attempted to spoon feed me after the first generation, I eventually quit. I will give this game that the first generation, playing as Leonhardt is fun, enjoyable, and gets you attached to the characters in the game, but at the point of which you have a child, especially one that has less emotion than a sheet of cardboard, (also, how can that happen, a general has a kid with some elf chick who wears less clothing than a stripper and somehow the son turns out to be some kind of emotionless, characterless, amorphous, blob of cardboard) it tends to get pretty old pretty quick. Not to mention that regardless of which class you selectively breed your child to become, their stats ALMOST ALWAYS are contradictory to the class, such as with scythe weilders having no mobility or strength, or swordsman having the same, etc. It gets to a point where its unbearable, and not only that but with a lack of a way to passively regain energy in battles efficiently, to the point of which its better to just use it all up in one sitting rather than bother even ATTEMPTING to use your attacks skillfully, considering that your positioning at the begining of the match will almost always be viable and easy to work with, and if not, oh well, looks like its time to form a vanguard of tanks around the OP AS ♥♥♥♥ main character and hope they last long enough to kill the boss.\n\nEither way this game has like a few hours of good gameplay i guess? not really recommended.

Since it was so repetitve I eventually found out about Auto-Battle and never went back. I left auto-battle on throughout most of my playthrough and while the AI might  kill themselves I found it more enjoyable to just let the game work itself out, turning a strategy game into a simulation.\n\nThe features such as capturing monsters/upgrading weapons/skills looks daunting but after a bit, it seems simple. Some of the choices that were presented during the story makes an impact on who you have a child with throughout the generations. I wouldn't recommend it, it's not for everyone. Don't look for combat to be very fulfilling. It would be difficult to recommend to anyone who wanted to take apart of the strategy aspect of the game.\n\nThe game can be fun for some players though, I'm sure the story is okay at best. I got bored of it past my second generation in the game. The choices in those scenes between battles, (events maybe?) there weren't that engaging for me. It was basically choose and see how the rest of your part reacts, I didn't really like any of them that much. I can see the appeal however, just that I felt  detatched from protaganist to protagainst.","March 21, 2015","false","25.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would not suggest it for beginners; as a mercurial gamer myself, even I had some trouble with it.\n\nMy main problem, however, was not with gameplay itself, but with the game in general; it's very detailed graphically, and you will likely have a certain amount of lag and clippyness unless you lower the graphics settings.\n\nMoving on: the .jp voices were kind of disorienting, as I understand very little Japanese. I found myself automatically trying to parse out what little I know from the voice acting, which distracted me from the actual dialogue. Of course, that's my problem.\nThe dialogue itself is kind of strange; perhaps it's just the translation, but the characters mostly seem to speak in a ridiculously eloquent manner. Probably the most absurd scene in the game involves the characters discussing a boulder in their path (I had a lot of fun commenting on this). Everyone seems to wax poetic every ten seconds, which is actually pretty annoying. Maybe if you're a philosophy major, you'll enjoy that.\n\nLong story short: Very strange and unfamiliar game. Would recommend playing while very, VERY high.","February 7, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While playing off of familiar fantasy tropes, it uses them well to create an interesting world that frames a wonderful generational system. Add in the tactically challenging combat system, relying on linking characters together and utilizing ability combos to defeat enemies, and this game is a real blast to play.\n\nWhile some people may be turned off by the anime visuals and fanservice elements, if they can look past those elements and at the expansive fantasy journey being presented this is definitely one of the more engaging releases on Steam. I recommend this game to any fans of fantasy RPGs, and those who like a well implemented generational system in their games.","September 13, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
