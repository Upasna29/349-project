By now you already know whether or not you are going to be getting this game, which makes this review rather pointless. What can I possibly say that you haven't already heard; what tidbit of exclusive information can I pass on that you already don't know. It's not like Activision has been keeping their games a secret. I guess all that's left for me to do is share my personal experience with the game, what the designers did right, what they did wrong, and let the chips falls where they may.\n\nThere are so many Call of Duty installments out there it's hard to keep them straight when it comes to the story. Modern Warfare 3 is the direct sequel to Modern Warfare 2, which was the direct sequel to the original Modern Warfare, so in essence, this is the third installment in the trilogy. We have our familiar cast of characters, Soap, Price, and Nickolai, and a new recruit, Yuri, the Russian member of your team who will be at the other end of your controls for most of the missions. Makarov is still up to his old tricks in his quest for global domination. After his failed attempt in Modern Warfare 2, Makarov has basically initiated WWIII with an assault on the USA as well as a massive simultaneous terrorist strike using bio-weapons.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 assaults you with its overpowering presentation, from the opening moment where your Humvee is taken out by an RPG in NYC and a building explodes and comes raining down on you until the bittersweet final boss encounter. Despite its aging graphics engine, the game maintains a fluid 60fps while pumping out graphics that are easily on par with Battlefield 3. Some scenes border on photorealistic, and when you set the entire thing in motion with sweeping cinematic camera moves things get real crazy real fast. The level of complexity in the level design and the amount of detail is staggering and surprisingly, especially in the multiplayer maps, and it only gets better on the PC.\n\nThe sound mix is completely immersive with a stirring soundtrack that will fuel your adrenalin, great voice acting and in-game chatter, and some fantastic sound effects for all the weapons and explosions. The sampling rate has been boosted so these guns have never sounded better or more realistic, and there are plenty of shellshock and disorientation effects that will leave you breathless. Sadly, the whole presentation falls a bit short of console greatness since I'm not playing on a home theater, but with a good set of speakers or surround headphones, Modern Warfare 3 will still blow you away - just not as much.\n\nThe game kicks off in New York City and thanks to pre-release coverage, you've probably already seen most of the first two chapters that has you destroying an enemy jamming tower then heading out into the harbor to cripple a Russian sub and launch its missiles on its own fleet. From there you'll need to rescue Soap from a safe house, then protect the Russian president and his daughter in one of my favorite levels that had me feeling like Harrison Ford in Air Force One. Then it's off to Sierra Leone, London, Somali, Paris, and Berlin as you try to foil Makarovs plans for world supremacy.\n\nWithout a doubt, this is the best story in the trilogy, with each mission feeding into the next or at least having some parallel story thread. There are no missions stuck in there just because they are "cool", but every mission is extremely cool, a Hollywood set piece worthy of a Michael Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer joint venture. The pacing is frantic, the energy and action nonstop, and yet they manage to work in moments of butt-clenching suspense when you are sneaking through enemy territory and one false move or loud noise can end your mission.\n\nThe 15-part story, divided into three acts, will take you about 8 hours to complete on Normal and about 10 on Hard. Most of the Steam achievements are divided up into the story, completing each chapter, completing the game on the various difficulty levels, and there are even a few skill challenges that are mission specific and quite fun to tackle. Of course, the hidden intel are back; 46 in all and some are quite diabolical. I have mixed emotions on these egg hunts, since it really takes you out of story to have your men yelling for you to advance and you're scouring every nook and cranny for a blue monitor.\n\nModern Warfare 3 brings back Spec Ops, a great co-op experience you can share online or local split-screen playing Survival mode or Mission mode. Survival mode basically puts you into levels and throws endless waves of enemies at you until you die, so your score and rank is based on how long you can stay alive. Things get downright evil when they start throwing combos like Juggernauts, Dogs, Choppers, and Bomb Squads at you.\n\nBut for most of the world, Modern Warfare 3 is all going to boil down to the competitive multiplayer and frankly, it doesn't get any better than this. There is a large selection of maps and modes including fan favorites like Team DM, Sabotage, Domination, HQ, CTF, and Search and Destroy, but the game gets exponentially better once you play the new modes like Team Defender and Kill Confirmed. Team Defenders is basically CTF but you have no place to return the flag. There is only one flag and you merely run around with the flag while your team tries to protect you. The team who can carry the flag to the target limit win.\n\nSledgehammer has taken the franchise back to its roots, or at least as far back as Call of Duty 4; the original Modern Warfare. Gone are all the unrealistic gameplay devices like Nukes and the Commando perk. Modern Warfare 3 is making the game more personal with a focus on close-quarters combat. Sniper rifles have been retuned, and air-support has been downsized. Modern Warfare 3 is all about teamwork and getting back to the good old days of Team DM; statistically, the most played multiplayer mode in Call of Duty.\n\nThe Perks system hasn't changed all that much. You still choose three then complete the various challenges to earn the Pro version. What has changed, for the better in my opinion, are the perks themselves. They just seem to make more sense now, and they all contribute to a more balanced and team-focused gameplay experience. Unrealistic perks like Commando, OMA, Last Stand, and the game-ending Tactical Nuke are now only a bad memory.\n\nModern Warfare 3 is going to offer all your favorite weapons and nothing much has changed when it comes to selection or balance. New for Modern Warfare 3 is the ability to rank up your weapons through continued use, so the more you use a gun, the better you get with it.\n\nModern Warfare 3 also improves upon the existing Prestige system. After you reach the end of the 80th level and hit the Prestige button you get taken to the new Prestige Shop where you can choose from eleven different rewards. With each prestige you get a Prestige Token to spend in the Prestige Shop on whatever you wish as well as your complimentary Prestige Icon.\n\nModern Warfare 3 is a shining example of refinement and improvement. It's familiar, sure, but here familiarity doesn't breed contempt, just respect and reward for those who've dedicated so much time to the series. And for new players, it's the perfect starting point, more accommodating and encompassing than ever. The series has always been renowned for elements like the excellent sound design, the gloss, polish and compulsion of its gameplay, but with Modern Warfare 3, Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer have created a game that not only lives up to the brand hype but exceeds it.","October 21, 2015","true","290.0"," 92 of 120 people (77%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","77","92","120","16","1"

Modern Warfare 3 was something I looked forward too but I had hear bad things about it. So I waited a few years and actually played in this order COD1,UO,WAW,4,BlackOps,MW2,Ghosts,BlackOps2,and finally MW3. I used to hate Call of Duty and it took me a while to distinguish the enjoyment of the singleplayer experiance from the twitch shooter that is the repetitive multiplayer that has really not changed since COD1, if anything it has lost amazing game modes (BehindEnemyLines,BaseAssault). When Bad Company 2 came out I basically said the hell with COD, BUT I came back to the franchise for what it does right, the enjoyable rollercoster that is the playable movie of the Campaign. I loved the story in ModernWarfare and the trilogy is pretty well wrapped up with MW3. A lot of questions about the story are answered if the ending itself is a little lackluster for all the work you have gone through in the previous games to get to the ultimate showdown of two dewds. Anyway no spoilers but the campaign was pretty well paced and enjoyable with some great set peices and the feel of WW3 was captured as well as this old engine can capture.\n\nI would not recommend this game to anyone to start with, nor if you are not invested into the ModernWarfare trilogy story etc. For fans of the series though its a must, to bring the story arc to a rather thrilling conclusion. I still think the Black Ops games have been the best COD games since COD united Offensive and the original MW.\n\nHope this helps you guys. It gets a cautious recommend from me for fans of the franchise and story.","December 28, 2014","true","7.2"," 58 of 68 people (85%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","85","58","68","7","0"

If it gets boring, pick a harder difficulty (and have fun dying if you picked one too hard). The fact that each mission isn't totally reset when you die is a lovely perk that (while I should have expected, I didn't) made the game much more enjoyable. The special ops missions are a lot of fun, but a few things should be pointed out:\n1). It can take a while to find people to play with, so if you don't have patience, bring friends.\n2). You can't play cross - server special ops with your friends, so if you have a Mac and your friends have Windows, you're out of luck.\n3). If you do have a Mac ( and Windows - loving friends), play multi - player\n\nMulti - Player: A ton of fun to play once you can participate in the games in any meaningful amount (meaning that you don't get killed every time you poke your head out of the hole you're hiding in). However, a few tips:\n1). There aren't any set noob maps, so if you're new, this can be frustrating. But, if I made it (and I sucked a TON at first), you can make it (unless you suck more than I did).\n2). There aren't any rooftop vantages or upper floor rooms that are protected to the point when sniping becomes a good option for new players. (Some maps don't have ANY  very elevated sniping spots) You have to be good (i would hesitantly say VERY good) in order to run and gun with a sniper, so avoid this unless you have a lot of practice in the single - player (harder difficulties) or in other games\n3). Many of the game modes don't have anyone playing them. The two that i've found to be most frequented by players are Team Deathmatch and Kill Confirmed. Others are played, of course, but it will be harder to find a full room.\n4). As always, playing with friends is a ton of fun, and if some of them are experienced, all the better. If you don't have friends, quit playing games and find some :). JK. I don't have friends either.\n\nA fun game in the FPS category, and I had a lot of fun playing. However, patience and time are necessary for the full experience. Despite the restrictions at first, the hackers (there weren't that many, actually, but they were annoying), and the limited gamemodes, I enjoyed my time, so I'll give this a (7/10).\n\nActually, on second thought, I've remembered how much fun I had playing hide and seek with a bunch of guys (armed with Five - Sevens), playing arrow - chicken with C4 and Frag Grenades, and amusing my friends by making ridiculously macho comments, then dying a second later by more attentive players. So, I'll give it an 8/10.\n\nAlways remember: If at first you don't succeed, you probably never will. Give up now and save yourself some trouble :).","April 14, 2015","true","10.5"," 60 of 75 people (80%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","80","60","75","21","0"

I don't buy call of duty games for the multiplayer because real people are too hard for me.  I play for the story because I actually want to know the plot of the game which is why I brought most of the series for the campaign.  The first game in the Modern Warfare series was great I liked how real the battles felt.  MW 3 takes place during the war with Russia and most of the missions are in the U.S.   I thought it was interesting to see the U.S. in this kind of state because of war.  Most of the characters that are from the other Modern Warfare games die in this final game of the triology.  I wasn't really expecting that but that's what I like about the Modern Warfare series.  You don't expect a lot to happen in the games but the MW series really surprises you.\n\n10/10 would recommend the game.  Got the game at $40 because I couldn't wait for a sale.","November 8, 2014","true","10.1"," 44 of 58 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","44","58","2","0"

As for PC performance, I have a fairly decent computer and was worried about it not being able to run, after turning all the graphics down, it ran fine, as for the multiplayer, it is lacking people, but is very challenging and a fun time, the community sucks, but that's expected for a Call of Duty Game. I have only seen one hacker in my time online, the servers will slightly lag every now and then, and I know it's not just me.\n\nIn retrospect, this game is great, despite it's flaws, it is still a game well worth the money you have to pay for to get it.","December 8, 2013","true","32.9"," 101 of 161 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","101","161","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Terminally-Chill/recommended/42680/","Terminally-Chill","SHARKE BYTE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Terminally-Chill/","810 products in account","Pros:The same great action of the previous games. Lots of multiplayer options.\n\nCons:Not much changed since Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Single-player campaign is confusing for people who haven't played the other Modern Warfare games.\n\nModern Warfare 3 picks up where Modern Warfare 2 left off. I mean, exactly where it left off. Russia is at war with America, Makarov is at large, Soap's injured, and everything is blowing up. If you didn't play Modern Warfare 2, which served as a decent starting point and didn't require the first game to understand it, you won't have any idea about what's going on, and the game doesn't do much to get you up to date. It feels very much like the third movie in a trilogy, and the second movie ended on a cliffhanger.\n\nThe gameplay, both in single player and multiplayer modes, is identical to that of Modern Warfare 2. You can carry two weapons and two types of grenades (one offensive, one special) at one time and you have to hide behind cover and employ tactical savvy in your approach firefights if you want to kill your enemies. It's an established and functional style that captures modern, "realistic" first-person shooter games. If you get hit a few times, you need to hide behind cover until you heal, or a few more stray bullets can kill you. It's unforgiving, but balanced.\n\nMultiplayer is the big draw of Modern Warfare 3, and it pays off just as much as it did in the other games in the series. There are the same seemingly endless customization options, with an experience system and the ability to build your own class with different weapons and abilities. The killstreak system from previous games has been refined into a points-based system that gives players more balance. Instead of getting points for each kill, players can choose Assault, Support, and Specialist modes that give them different rewards. Assault is the traditional killstreak system, where you get new abilities like missile strikes for more kills in a single life. Support counts your kills and other actions between lives, constantly moving up and giving you support-based abilities like UAVs. Specialist gives you more perks for your kills, instead of new weapons it effectively turns you into a super-soldier who's faster, stronger, or able to take more damage.\n\nThe multiplayer options offer a benefit over Battlefield 3, which only has six cooperative missions compared to over a dozen in Modern Warfare 3. Competitive play is pretty evenly matched, with leveling in Modern Warfare 3 universal and steadily unlocking weapons and skills and leveling in Battlefield 3 and rewarding your class as you play it. The big difference between the two games is that Battlefield 3 has vehicles, which can change the nature of a game dramatically. To go to extremes, Modern Warfare 3 is more suitable for Counter-Strike fans, while Battlefield 3 is more suitable for Halo fans, but the distinction between the two modern combat games are far smaller than the rift between the two classic shooters.\n\nModern Warfare 3 is a solid follow-up to Modern Warfare 2 and Black Ops, and if you loved those games you'll love this one. It doesn't change anything big, and the single-player campaign wraps up a story with most of the exposition lodged in previous games, but it offers a great multiplayer experience and a solid, if predictable and occasionally frustrating, single-player experience.","May 3, 2015","true","129.7"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","29","39","4","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kythrol/recommended/42680/","Kythrol","Kythrol","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kythrol/","601 products in account","The Modern Warfare series' finale.\n\nBack in November 2011, I told myself I wouldn't get this game. I was upset with Activision that Infinity Ward was no longer Infinity Ward, I thought the game is going to suck and I didn't want to play a Call of Duty game ever again. Or something along the lines of that. But in the end, I did give in to the hype and got it.\n\nIt might have been caused by my low expectations, but I enjoyed the campaign a lot. It didn't suck, it didn't feel like an utter waste of time, it didn't scream 'throw me into the trash bin.' It felt like a proper Call of Duty title, with all of your explosions, plot twists and emotions included. I don't think I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't played the two previous Modern Warfare games yet, because it jumps straight in where its predecessor ended which could obviously leave you not knowing what's really going on, but everyone else - yeah, the campaign is solid. And also a trip all around the world.\n\nThe multiplayer feels, well, revised. Much more balanced in terms of killstreak (or pointstreak, in Modern Warfare 3's case) rewards, overpowered explosives, perks and all that stuff, though not so much in the guns section as weapons like the MP7 or ACR are clearly better than the others. It's not a deal-breaker, though - the game is enjoyable, and there are some cool new things like the Kill Confirmed game mode or the already mentioned pointstreak rewards system which divides them into three categories, allowing you to even get some defensive & support ones without your points resetting on death. The maps are good as well as usual in Call of Duty.\n\nThe last thing I definitely have to mention (and recommend) is the new Survival mode, which allows you to - either alone or with a bunch of friends - try and survive against waves of enemies, similar to the Zombies mode in Treyarch's iterations of the series. It's fun to just jump in and mess around.\n\nAll in all, Modern Warfare 3 is a good game.","November 8, 2015","true","14.7"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","16","17","2","0"

If you want to know why, read on.\n\nI have over 600 hours played in the multiplayer, which you cannot see because Steam uses two different apps for this game, one for singleplayer and one for multiplayer. And I don't even know why, because much of it was more frustrating than fun. But I think I have experienced the best and the worst this game has to offer, and can tell other people with good conscience what they will get from this.\n\nCoD games have a history of receiving flak from dedicated FPS players for being bad games despite their popularity on consoles. Since this was my first time playing a game of the MW series, most of this, such as "60$ map pack", didn't apply to me. I went into it with an open mind free of prejudice, and here is what I got:\n\nAt first, the game is quite fun. It is polished, the controls are sharp and responsive, the sound and keybinds work as they should. None of the things that usually accompany console ports such as mouselag or unbindable keys, it would seem. However, the FoV is locket at 60, so any dedicated player is forced to rely upon a certain 3rd party tool to fix this issue.\n\n\nSingleplayer\n\nThe single-player campaign is passable. In typical CoD style, you usually enter an area and have enemies respawn indefinitely until you move to the next checkpoint. Ignoring that the most efficient way to play is to rush through instead of actually fighting, the FPS key elements such as gunplay and movement are solid. The game is, however, heavy on scripted sequences and quicktime events.\nDespite being more of an old-school FPS player, I wasn't too bothered with the modern stuff such as bloody screen, regenerating health and checkpoints.\n\n\nMultiplayer\n\nSince most people play CoD exclusively for the multiplayer, this will be the major part of my review. And boy, you are in for something.\nNow, as stated above, the game itself plays pretty good. Unfortunately, the multiplayer part is plagued by a number of massive issues which outnumber the good parts a thousandfold.\n\nFirst off, this game is designed all around the famous skinner box. It compels you to play, even in times you don't really want to or are not having a good time. What this translates to ingame are a number of psychological features that would be an absolute no-go for any good gamedesign, such as leveling up, unlocking guns and similar. I'm sure the developers could make a game that was actually good instead of forcing people to play through psychology... if they actually tried. But as it is, MW3 is designed to keep you addicted for a certain amount of time, after which it starts to get boring quickly. That timeframe, who could have guessed, is a few months, just enough until before the release date of the next title in the CoD series.\n\nThen, there is this weird feature that is called "lag compensation". Now, the feature in inself is nothing new and has been seen in games for years. But the way it is implemented here it actually gives players with bad connections an huge advantage over players with good connections. Dying the very instant you cross a corner before even seeing anyone, only to see your opponent had seconds of spraying your helpless body is a frequent occurrence. Since I had a fast connection, I would suffer massively from this feature, to the point where I had to actively limit my internet speed to be on an even playing field with everyone else.\n\nNow here is the main part: the multiplayer is infested with cheaters. Like you wouldn't believe. We UT and Quake players always used to make fun of CS for its amount of wallhackers, but MW3 is in an entirely different league. Cheaters are so prevalent in MW3 that finding a single game without a cheater is practically impossible, and I'm not exaggerating. Wish I was. More often than not, there would be 2-3 cheaters in any single game you come across.\nAnd I'm not talking about simple wallhackers. I'm talking about guys with godmode on, unlimited ammo, can kill you the very moment you spawn from the other end of the map through all walls and objects and even teleport all players on the map high in the air to fall to their death in 10 seconds intervals. Or outside the playable map, to have them stand around, being unable to do anything until the torture ends.\nThere is no working anti-cheat feature in MW3 whatsoever. What is worse is, MW3 is designed in such a way that not only it is impossible to punish cheaters, it even encourages them through the use of a lobby system. There are no servers where such players could be banned, or even a vote system to kick them. If you end up with one cheater in a 20 player match, the only solution would be for the other 19 players to abandon the game and leave, only to be replaced with new unsuspecting victims until the cheater is satisfied to his hearts content.\nOne of the players in the lobby would always end up as the host for a match. There used to be a 3rd party program which let you analyze the IP connections in the game and with the help of another filtering program, you could deny certain IP adresses to connect to your PC, essentially banning cheaters from your games if you were fortunate enough to be chosen as the host. The sad part is that MW3 is so infested with cheaters that using those tools is practically mandatory if you want at least a few of your games to be actually playable. What's worse is that there are a number of players who also abused this. They would ban anyone they felt like banning, for reasons such as killing them, saying something they didn't like, using a weapon they didn't like or choosing to play in a way they didn't like.\nThat, however, was before cheaters had hacks that could force them to become host of their games, every time. Now, cheaters were not only able to kill any players with the push of a button, but they had total control over their games, and giving everyone else a ridiculously high ping in the process.\n\nCheaters are everywhere and anywhere, and it is impossible to avoid them. Playing MW3 online without being a cheater yourself is like bringing a knife to a tank fight. They turn the multiplayer into a unplayable mess, and the developer/publisher refuse to adress this problem. It's like they don't give a damn, once you've paid your 60$ you've "done your duty" and are now expendable, thank you very much come again next year with your wallet. I know, fire-and-forget port of a console game, but still. While theoretically it's the players ruining the game, the fact that those companies even fail to do as much as acknowledge a problem of such a degree that it turns a game into a basically nonfunctional product is borderline fraudulent. I refuse to support companies that treat their customers in such a way, and will never, ever again buy something from Actvision. I gave them a chance to earn my trust (and money), and they blew it as hard as you possibly can. A shame, really, I liked the game in itself, and I wanted to play it, as you can no doubt tell from my 600 hours, but problems of such a scale completely ruin every aspect of it and turn it into nothing more than a ♥♥♥♥-fest.\n\nTL;DR: There are two kinds of people playing MW3 online: cheaters, and masochists. If you are neither, I suggest you stay as far away from this game as you possibly can, or you're in for a lot of frustration.","May 23","false","23.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

One thing that i really dislike about it's singleplayer is the plot. It really childish and doesn't make any sense. Not only that, but it also was a bad conclusion to the trilogy.\n\nMultiplayer\nInstead it went on pleasing the noobs, with\n1)small maps\n2)bad spawns(people would basically spawn right behind you)\n3)overpowered guns\nThe leveling up became so fast, it takes like 5 days to reach the highest level.\nAlso, they barely gave it any changes.\nThe guns feel disturbing, the graphics really outdated. And this is an AAA title game, that's just absurd.\n\nCoop\nConsists of Survival and Spec Ops. They also have a separate leveling system for you in the coop(level cap is 50). By leveling up you get new weapons/equipment in survival, and access to the next ranked missions in spec ops.\nSpec ops is a 2 player coop mode. Consists of 16 missions. It's set in a level, that was either used in the campaign or multiplayer, and has some objective for you to complete. This is really lazy, and you will be bored for the most part when playing those.\nThe only good thing was the Survival Mode aka Horde mode. A 2 player coop mode, where you have to fend off the waves of enemies. They use 16 multiplayer maps as the level you play on, with a few minor adjustions. Dispite being good, the concept of survival isn't new. Almost every shooter has one. And don't tell me "no big deal", for this game brought zero innovation to the table.\nIt's for sure is the worst COD ever made.\n\nPlus to that, the game is very graphically outdated. I don't usually pay attention to graphics, but those were just below average standards, and this is an AAA title we're talking about here, that's just unacceptable.\n\nConclusion: Avoid it. This is probably not only the worst COD ever made, but also the worst game ever made. Still don't get me?\nRemember the movie adaption of Avatar: the Last Airbender. Not only was it bad as a movie adaption, but also bad as a movie in general, it puts the whole movie industry to shame. Well, the same can be said about Modern Warfare 3.","April 30, 2013","false","64.9"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","25","39","0","1"

It runs on my comp on extra at 1920x1200 and it runs flawlessly, and I can't say this about BF3, so for me Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® 3 it's the best shooter of 2011, and I think no game can take this title fom him. 10/10.","November 21, 2011","true","9.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Warlordjb/recommended/42680/","Warlordjb","TGDPlays","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Warlordjb/","46 products in account","This was one of the last decent Call Of Duties before they took off (Literally) with the jump packs and Halo jumping nonsense. To me this is a real Call Of Duty and it plays exactly how an arcade shooter should in most ways. This is the last COD with pro perks, a feature that they removed for unknown reasons. Probably because players are too lazy to shoot down 40 killstreaks or destroy 50 enemy equipments (Lazy buggers).\n\nThe guns in the game aren't at all balanced, but that's what makes it fun, how you ask? Well I will tell you how. There's nothing more satisfying than dropping a M.O.A.B against a full party of MP7/ACR using tryhards with an underpowered weapon. Recoil isn't really a problem on this game, 1 or 2 guns present a mini challenge but anyone with a brain knows how to pull down slightly with the mouse.\n\nThe 3 killstreak options made this game very fresh and added numerous different playstyles to the game. The noobs get rewarded even if they die if they opt for the support package. Moab hunters get rewarded when using the specialist package. And the diehard MW2 fans get rewarded for using the Assault package. The killstreaks aren't that powerful in the assault package, nowhere near as good as MW2 but it can still be fun to use from time to time.\nMost of the maps on Modern Warfare 3 have decent design and stick to the same formula that was used on Modern Warfare 2. They promote rushing and movement most of the time and they try to stay small so you won't be caught looking for a gunfight for too long (Unlike Ghosts. Yuck). However, some players still insist on using Thermal LMGs in the most annoying ways. There are quite a few clans that scour TDM using this strategy. LMGs combined with a campy playstyle is almost impossible to beat considering they're deadly accurate with thermal. I would personally consider them to be overpowered. Almost everything has some sort of counter-play, minus the C4. If you have blast shield on and it's right next to you. You're dead, no questions asked, same thing with claymores and Bouncing betties. Your only saviour is a ballistic vest and this means you will have to play using the support package which is heavily looked down upon by most players.\n\nQuickscopers and proper snipers are a pain on this game yes, but you will find yourself surviving a shot from them quite often (If you really hate them, ballistic vests make sure you're always a 2 hit kill, even to the head!) however, a decent quickscoper can outclass any gun at any range and it makes things quite unfair. Quickscopers can easily outclass a shotgunner/SMG at close range which never makes any sense, but then again there are tonnes of things which don't make sense in COD, like another age old problem of shooting first, hitting them a tonne and somehow dying first? That's the problem with the extremely low tickrate that COD has. If we could have a tickrate above 100 then things would improve drastically. Or would they?\n\nThe online support for this game is where things begin to go sour very quickly. Hackers are allowed to roam free and there are some days where you begin to forget what a normal lobby even looks like. You can run into the same hacker for months on end and report him everytime and nothing will be done, the report button is like the pointless button from ASDF movie. If you leave say a TDM lobby and go back to search for a TDM lobby, you will often find yourself back in the exact same lobby, this is another frustrating feature. Also there's the age old problem of joining a game where your team is losing by 60 kills and there's no way you will win and it goes against your Win loss ratio. Many players take pride in their W/L but most of the time there's nothing you can do to save it.\n\nKicktool abusers are exactly what this game doesn't need and they're everywhere! This tool was released so the MW3 community could combat hackers by kicking them, but now it's used by good/bad players to kick decent players from the lobby so it's easy for them. Bad players end up thinking everyone who kills them has some sort of hack because of their God complex. Whilst the good players (With the hacktool) have no honour and kick the other good players as soon as they see their KD in danger.\nTo conclude my review, I must admit that this game has been a lot of fun over the years and was definitely worth the £30 I spent back in the day on it. But it's not worth that now at all. The DLC is dead, half the multiplayer modes are empty, and the player base is dwindling. You will be lucky to reach above 100 hours before growing to hate the game and quitting it, never looking back again. Rightly so, Activision and co never continue supporting their older games and that's their downfall, it's sad but unfortunately it's a way of life. Why generate a loss by appeasing the players that remain on the old CODs when you can 'appease' the players on the newer CODs and continue generating revenue? I digress, time for the ratings out of ten.\n\nMultiplayer: 6/10 - It's broken and there's no denying that.\n\nCampaign : 7/10 - It kept to the MW formula that made the other MW games fun.\n\nSpecial ops/survival etc : 5/10 - I found myself getting bored instantly with both Spec ops and survival. They effectively copied MW2s spec ops, just badly.\n\nOverall: 6.5/10 - This is a very fun game If you can look past all the hackers, kick tool abusers, campers, overpowered weapon abusers and headglitchers. It still isn't worth the price tag however. £20 sounds more reasonable.\nThanks for reading.","April 18","true","43.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

It has evolutionized the genre and changed the way we play and think of FPS games. Althought, the game adds nothing new to the already complex formula, it does adds smoothness to the game core mechanics and the fast paced arcade-style shooter, ranking & rewarding as well as unique kill streak system in which skillful players shall go on a rampage quite easily with the aid of air supports or ground fire powers.\n\nThe thrid entry to the series does not dissappoint because the single player campaign is filled with action as well as intense sequences. The story is well written and completed the story in a consistent and well told narrative. It also did a great job on connecting all the previous games together while maintaining twists that will keep the player guessing with unpredictably deep story. The story mode does not have a good replayability unless you are a collection fanatic that will be interested in perfecting the game with enemy intels, other wise I'd say it is not worth the hassle.\n\nThe music score is an honorable mention here as the composer Brian Tayler has really hit the score with the music on the battlefield as well as the impact of guns and bullets hitting different places. The sound track is overall excellent not only does it set a atmospherical environment but it also connects the emotional link between the players and the characters and maintaining this link is what gives us the reason to care about the characters.\n\nIn terms of multiplayer, the same formula applies. It is still addictive and still fun as new weapons and maps being added but the only down side to that is that additional DLCs will cost a fortune.\n\nOverall I will recommend this game to all FPS lovers and action gamers in general.","September 23, 2015","true","132.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","8","10","3","0"

I will admit that despite the blatant rehashing of MW2 assets (models, textures, even the bloody HUD), the campaign was entertaining enough to keep me going from start to finish. Soap and Price are both badasses. The scripted destruction events are admittedly well done and immersive. The weapons pack a lot of punch and feel satisfying to use. The plot, while predictable, is sufficiently intriguing and isn't riddled with cheesy dialogue. Still, it can't compare to the first Black Ops, which had quite a memorable campaign that I truly enjoyed.\n\nUnfortunately, the multiplayer, which was what kept me coming back to previous COD games, proved to be the same letdown that MW2 was.\n\nNo dedicated servers if you want a ranked game. On a PC platform where latency is very noticeable thanks to everyone using a hyper-responsive keyboard and mouse, this is unacceptable. If everyone's connection is decent, then the experience is tolerable but still inferior to that of a dedicated server. Especially when a game supports up to 18 players, who don't necessarily all live in the same geographic region. It's most annoying when host migration occurs due to someone ragequitting or just experiencing an Internet blackout. There's a reason why even some co-op games like Left 4 Dead use dedicated servers despite the considerably lower player count - the performance is just so much better that way!\n\nCOD also pretty much kickstarted the modern trend of charging $15 USD for a handful of maps as DLC, instead of letting the community make their own custom maps. Now, paid DLC isn't necessarily a bad thing. After all during the CD-ROM days we were happily buying expansion packs for games, which were smaller than sequels but added a great deal of extra content that made the price worth it. Starcraft Brood War, the original Half-Life expansions, Command and Conquer Generals, etc, all would qualify as "worthwhile DLC". However, COD's DLC is nothing but level geometry that any dedicated modder could slap together in his spare time. It's not an expansion pack and not worth it at all.\n\nAt least when Overkill Software (Payday 2) does DLC, they allow non-owners to access the DLC if the server host owns it ,which keeps the community together. Not exactly my cup of tea, but a lot fairer than the COD DLC model that has sadly infected Battlefield and other once-great series.\n\nGarbage games like MW3 don't even deserve to be pirated. Pirating the game would send a message to IW/Activision that the product is popular/desirable. Unfortunately, looking at current trends COD is going to be here for a very long time.","September 19, 2015","false","5.0"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","12","18","2","0"

Now, I want to expand it.\n\nModern Warfare 3 takes where the previous game left you. Soap, the hero of Modern Warfare and the captain of the former Team 141, is badly wounded. Price and him escape thanks to Nikolai but you're followed by the fanatics under Makarov's order. Makarov? He's a mad Russian terrorist, an ultra-nationalist that attacked his own people in an airport to trigger a war against USA - though Shepherd, the general commanding Soap's unit isn't really a stranger to that. Anyway, after Shepherd's betrayal and death, Price and Soap are considered as war criminals. But it doesn't mean that they're going to stay without searching to clear their name. They're helped by Yuri, a man that hates Makarov with a passion. And during that time, Frost, a US soldier, will also participate to the battles of his life in USA and Europe....\n\nTo understand the settings of Modern Warfare, it's strongly recommended to play Modern Warfare and Modern Warfare 2 as you'll find characters appearing in all these games. Or also just to understand the background.\n\nModern Warfare 3 will make you play Soap, though briefly, Yuri, the Russian that will follow Price and Soap into their missions, Frost, battling against Russians in USA and Europe and under Sandman's command - Sandman being an ancient member of Team 141, Harkov, a Russian bodyguard for the President, Burns, a SAS member pursuing terrorists in London and Price for the last mission of Modern Warfare.\n\nAs usual, the goal is to make sure your objectives are done, without being killed (you don't have an health meter, so the only way to survive is to retreat and let the screen coming back to normal), with  people to protect. You're not alone, you always have friends with you (Soap and Price when you're Yuri, Sandman and his squad when you're Frost, etc..).\n\nTrue, it's a Call of Duty, so don't expect anything making a full use of your brain (only when you need not to be spotted). And I still don't like a too nervous gameplay but you're getting used to it. Though good luck in Veteran...\n\nHowever, the places you're visiting are really great: from Paris to Berlin by New York or Siberia...\n\nA Call of Duty wouldn't be a Call of Duty if you don't loose some teammates or get your own character killed (will you be surprised that Makarov is also behind some kills?). The most shocking death will surprise you because you never thought that he would be killed off. Call of Duty, it's like the Walking Dead (the comic) or Games of Throne: you never know who will be killed or spared.\n\nThe graphics are marvelous. The music is badass.\n\nAnd you still have the mode where you can play alone or with a friend.\n\nModern Warfare 3 is really a good Call of Duty. Not really innovating, but the war seen by different points of view, knowing that each mission is tied to the previous one (ex: Price, Soap and Yuri got information, they've relayed it to the right people and Sandman and his squads are assigned on a mission based on that intel).\n\nOh yeah, the multiplayer? I don't play. No way. The CoD community is too... competitive to my tastes.\n\nGo ahead, you can buy it eyes closed.... if you own MW and MW2. Else you will never understand the universe unless you read all the facts on the wiki.","July 13, 2012","true","27.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

In the meantime I played all the rest of the series and when I got to MW3 and was playing through the chaos of this WW3 modern mayhem I was increasingly afraid that the campaign would end prematurely (like in the MW series) when you start getting infiltration missions in random bunkers outside of the main cities where the action takes place. And it did, the campaign seems shorter than the one in MW2, which I didn't think was physically possible. I runs only about 7h on 'hardened' and doesn't have much versatility. Sure SPEC OPS is now fully fleshed out with missions that run parallel to the storyline (saving Elena, playing bomb squad in Berlin like in 'The Hurt Locker', covering your team mate with air support while he advances on the ground) but most of the gameplay is straight point, shoot, cover with very little strategy. The original COD games were about securing zones so that your troops could advance and take over the cities from the Germans in WW2, you felt you were progressing through the geography and everything felt grounded and cohesive. Here you're just running like crazy from checkpoint to checkpoint and everything seems rushed. Ultimately the game feels like a missed opportunity because imagining a WW3 scenario with similar mechanics of the original would have been grand (you get glimpses of it while covering in between tanks in Berlin or advancing through Paris) but the game remains as superficial in gameplay as in storyline. I'm well aware that many just purchase the game for the multiplayer, and shooting each other in the those city maps sure is fun, but if only the game was as good as it's marketing it would be truly spectacular.\n\nPS: Also Spec ops is not Mac/PC compatible (MP is obviously), which means mac gamers will have an almost impossible time finding a partner. Aspyr ported Bordelands 2 and it's cross-platform, not getting this mode right for all COD series really sucks.","August 11, 2014","true","23.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is a sequel to the previous game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 continue the story from the previous game. The single player campaign only has new storyline, but the gameplay are mostly the same, go to objective A, then go to objective B to destroy objective C. The Special Ops game mode made a return in this game with new missions. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 also introduce the new survival game mode that you can play cooperatively with friends. The survival mode is quite interesting part of the single player game. The multiplayer of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 doesn't change much also.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 has quite improved graphics from the previous game, but doesn't have revolutionary upgrades, just small improvements. The water shaders are basically the same, I'm not even sure if those are shaders. Weapons models and characters has some improvements and changes in details. Performance are somewhat good, but not that good compared to the newer Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, which on the same system has far better performance. I sometimes got very heavy stutters which lead to crash to dekstop.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, while not being a great sequel, the survival single player game mode is interesting to play, especially on cooperative. I still recommend this.\n\nRating 6/10","December 17, 2013","true","16.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

You can not rely on simple tactics like securing an area. The entire game franchise went from epic battles with realism in mind to a constant intensive scene in an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. Distances and weapon damages makes it impossible to move around in groups, rather forcing everyone to be a lone wolf running around like a complete maniac. The game franchise went down the hill after the release of Modern Warfare 2, and it has continued to fall ever since.\n\nThere is much more to be said, how 95% of enemy contact is within a 5 meter range, or that they suck your wallet dry with unrealistic "gun skins" and rushed expansion packs. But the worst thing would be the maps. They are an everlasting Labyrinth of confusion. And why are the maps located at a mall, why would 18 special operation soldiers fight over a shopping mall?\n\nWe who remember the epic desert battles on the Toujane map in Call of Duty 2 can comprehend what todays kids are missing out on. And, of course, the majority of the players are 8-12 year old kids who screams in the microphones and does "trickshots".","August 12, 2015","false","122.1"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","15"

Because of that, I am going to make this redo a too long, didn't read version.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is what you expect from the Modern Warfare series but with a more Transformer approach to it. Anything and everything will be done over-the-top and there are explosions everywhere. The single player is very cheesy in the storyline and does not bring anything new other than an all out war. It's extremely bland and has repetitive levels. The opposite happens in the Special Ops, where there is indeed some improvements. There is more co-op missions and a survival wave mode added. Not a bad addition to the game at all, however, it does use a ranking system in order to unlock new weapons. Multiplayer is the same as usual but with new maps and the reintroduction of the game list first seen in MW1.\n\nGuns have more attachments. Attachments have gotten a redesign that has reduced the size of the reticle, allowing a player see more and thus kill more. However, they have also increased the "recoil/flinch" when getting hit by an enemy. Previously when hit, the reticle jumps a little bit; now it jumps, I estimate, 1/4 to 1/5th of the total screen size. This means that, when hit, you will not be able to kill your enemy because you will be aiming into the sky.\n\nOverall, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is an ok sequel and finish to the story of Price. It brings a some old, some new features back.\n\nObligatory Score: 7/10\n\n* * * Did a bit of searching and found my original review as it did not post correctly to Steam. Here it is, in all its glory. Originally posted on 24 October 2014 * * *\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is the first time I've played a Call of Duty game and though "wow, this is so stupid." I have played the first two games in the series and was finally able to get this a year after finishing Modern Warfare 2. In comparison, both games are highly similar in that the textures, storyline, voice, multiplayer, etc are all the same but with some tweaks.\n\nModern Warfare 3 brings a continued storyline, a different style of Spec Ops, more guns and attachments, and the return of matchmaking. The storyline is what I hated the most out of anything. It's so over the top and "Transformers"-like, where anything and everything will be cliche and filled with explosions. Every level is pretty much a repeat the of the last and it gets boring, fast. Spec Ops is revamped so that there's a bit of variety and not just the challenges from Modern Warfare 2. There are plenty of guns as in the last game and many have been improved to look better, however, recoil, when hit, has gone up by a lot. When playing on hardened or veteran, the huge jump in aim when hit pretty much means you are going to die.\n\nOverall, the game is just an updated Modern Warfare 2. That's really all it is. Modern Warfare 3 is still fun, but the storyline is too over-the-top.\n\nObligatory Score: 7/10","October 27, 2014","true","32.2"," 25 of 44 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","25","44","2","1"

The survival was pretty okay, it didn't wow me. The Spec ops missions were slightly good, kinda changed how it was played.\n\nI still don't get why Infinity Ward make you play as mute characters right until a cutscene (e.g. In Black Ops, Alex Mason talked in between points and not just the cutscenes and even say little bits like "Tango Down" or "FRAG OUT!!"). The scene after the friend dies [for reasons of spoilers, I'm not saying who], Yuri is grabbed by Captain Price and he demands to tell him about Makarov and Yuri does not talk until the cutscenes happen.

It...well a bit of interesting, but not so charming as in MW1, more global in a sense, but for me Modern Warfare is more of a hidden war than WW3 to be honest.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bizargh/recommended/42680/","bizargh","Bizargh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bizargh/","118 products in account","Before I provide my reasons for not recommending, let me provide you a solution to both Multiplayer & Singleplayer FOV:As Infinity Ward has ditched the ability to let us bind keys for commands such as FOV, Viewmodel positioning, No HUD, Noclip & such entirely from all modes of play (Unless you "inject" a custom program that enables Developer Console support, which I haven't managed to get working, so I'm not able to recommend it), there's now the MW3 FOV Changer, which gives you the ability to adjust FOV from 65° (Default) to 100° for both Singleplayer & Multiplayer equally. Instructions are simple: Just boot up the MW3 FOV Changer tool, launch the Main Game or Multiplayer from it, and whatever FOV you set it to in it's range, will always be played in the game. You can use the Numpad keys to adjust it in game manually if you desire, but simply typing your choice FOV (90.00 for example) will instantly apply in-game.\n\nThis should not get you VAC-Banned, as Infinity Ward officially condones it's use: https://community.callofduty.com/thread/200397140#205674719\n\nI'd like to once and for all give Infinity Ward's stance on this subject.\n\nWe do not mind if a PC user has the FOV changer mod.\n\nWe also do not ban anyone that is using the FOV mod.\n\nEDIT: Just had confirmation that Valve also does not issue bans for FOV changer.\nYou can download the tool from it's source here: http://www.mapmodnews.com/filemgmt/index.php?id=281\n\nAnd this video will demonstrate how to use it in seconds & spend about 2mins demonstrating it's effect: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTe3SF8V7bY\n\nRight, with that cleared up.\nMy Review\nOnce upon a time, a friend kindly lent me his Xbox 360 copy of this game for me to try. I played through the singleplayer, and finished it bored out of my mind minus a couple of laughs here & there. And unable to log into multiplayer due to needing a Call of Duty Elite account (If I recall that correctly), I never even got to try what I wouldn't play anyway with Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer mess very much in mind. I thought I'd never spent a penny on this game in my lifetime.\n\nBut it turns out, I did. I found other value for the game on PC, notably in the extractable audio files, so I bought it & did my thing. Then, many months later, I decided to see if there was any PC specific features to give it merit like the Developer Commands did for Call of Duty 4 & Modern Warfare 2. Turns out, there isn't (Without third-party tools I haven't figured how to get working), although the FOV Changer tool makes it very playable for me as someone who gets eye-strain & headaches within minutes due to the limited 65° default FOV.\n\nIt also runs well, it's visually satisfactory & I like the improvements in sound assets & design where it's been made.\n\n\nSingleplayer\nSo I played the singleplayer again. And I remembered why throughout the entire singleplayer, I was bored throughout. The sheer absence of novelty. Infinity Ward does essentially repeat Call of Duty 4's playbook a third-time, and forces in notes from Modern Warfare 2's playbook, which in itself followed Call of Duty 4's playbook while cranking it to 11. Although Call of Duty does often make for good dumb fun, this in particular was so dumb it was numbing.\n\n\n\nAnd such repeated "stunts" including watching a child dying, just to try to get that controversial factor "No Russian" got, falls completely flat on it's face. And on occasions where civilians enter gameplay to be a gameplay obstacle, they quite often are in enemy & ally's firing line and simply get mowed down by both anyway. I'd say how I found this rather distasteful (As well as pointless on numerous occasions), but I think it's better to state this as an example to the laziness in design behind this game, even when taking into account Infinity Ward was having staff troubles due to the Infinity Ward-Activision Lawsuit)\n\nI'm aware not many play Call of Duty for the Singleplayer, and have good reason to. But what has often made for good dumb fun, this time, it's just so utterly dumb it's unenjoyable. I personally consider it the franchise's worst single-player experience second to Call of Duty: Ghosts (Which I haven't played due to the fact I have zero intent on giving money to such an awfully running port).\n\n\nMultiplayer\nI can't offer much here. I never got access to it during my Xbox 360 play, and I'm not interested in trying now. I do hear it added some interesting game modes such as "Kill Confirmed", which did stick for future games and removed a number of trouble-causing perks such as Stopping Power. It takes very much after Modern Warfare 2, so if you did endup a fan of Black Ops' COD Points unlock system like myself, you'll probably be disappointed. I don't have anything further I can provide comment on.\n\n\nSpec Ops (Co-Op)\nI never gave this a try neither. I had my fun with Modern Warfare 2's Spec Ops mode, so I had no desire to jump into this again, even with the Horde-Mode like missions added into it.\n\n\nVerdict\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is a game very much starved of novelty in comparison to it's predecessors & Treyarch's entries made before it. It was a game that bored me throughout every minute I played it.\n\nIt may run well, be jam-packed with explosive visuals, crazy setpieces, grand audio assets, but there's just nothing here I haven't already seen before.\n\nPerhaps the Multiplayer & Spec Ops modes do infact hold more novelty & balance than I presume, but in the end, Call of Duty fans, there's plenty of far better entries in the franchise you could be playing instead, especially for the high-worth Activision maintains as long & relentlessly as it possibly can, until it does occasionly join a big Steam sale event or make it's own. So if you want this game, keep your eyes peeled for those sales.","December 12, 2014","false","7.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

By this game, the story doesn't even make sense.\n\nIt's as if someone thought up a bunch of neat things for a trailer, and then tried to weave them together with whatever half-baked excuse they could conjure.\n\nThe entire campaign plays "like a movie", meaning it's bearable on a solid run through. There is no replayability in any campaign mission. No mission stands out as the "I want to play that one again" type (Even MW2 had a few of those). There are lengthy on-rails sections in every mission where you don't have control of your character, and are forced to listen to other characters talk at you while enjoying the beautifully constructed scenery.\n\nUltimately, Modern Warfare 3 would make an average action movie, but as a game, it's forgotten that players should still actually play.","November 1, 2014","false","29.1"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

Allow creativity and as the saying goes, "do whatever you have to, to survive" voice over said it all, and the people in the Mission Incredible group took that phrase quite serious.

The onrail singleplayer, the fun-stripped multiplayer and the lack of major innovation all contribute to this feeling. However, there are some things done right, if not many.\nStarting with the singleplayer, it continues the trend of mindless action initiated with MW2. This would not be that much of a problem, as even some of the best titles in the series (CoD4, CoD2) don't have the most complex storylines, but in this  game it feels like the developpers first thought of what cool set piece they should introduce and built around that, when they should've made something more contextually appropriate (the example closest to mind is the mission where you use an armed ROV to effortlessly destroy the enemy). Most of the gimmicks that you see in singleplayer are put there because Sledgehammer Games wanted to justify various killstreaks that you can use in multiplayer. Despite all this, there is one small flash of brilliance in the campaign of MW3 and that is its ending mission. While it may not be amongst the most memorable in the series (Hill 400 in CoD2, Heat in CoD4, Vendetta and the final mission in CoD WaW), it certainly stands on its own as a fairly satisfying conclusion to the Modern Warfare series and it is quite a fun ride.\nMoving on, let's talk about the multiplayer which is mostly a mix of good and bad. One major complaint I have with the game is the levels on weapons and the need to earn XP for each weapon in order to unlock Proficiencies and attachments for it. This is a step in the complete wrong direction, even after Treyarch nailed it with the ability to buy which attachment or camo you want. Furthermore, the Proficiencies you can unlock for each weapon create massive disparities between newer and older players. This is most visible when using shotguns which have 2 Proficiencies that are vital: Range and Damage. Both of these are gained at  the last levels of the weapon, a decision I find most absurd. You will have to play most of your first 40 levels without them, which makes it really hard for you to perform with shotguns, especially the weaker AA-12. To make things worse, deathstreaks have returned, worse than ever, there even being a killstreak that shows you were your killer is. However, there were quite a few "innovations" introduced, such as the new killstreak system and the new gamemodes (Kill Confirmed, One in the Chamber, Gun Game etc.). The former is a pretty big improvement, making it possible to set custom killstreaks for each individual class. Also, they are now divided into 3 categories: Offensive (identical to the previous system), Support (similar to the Offensive, but the streak is not lost upon death) and Specialist (instead of killstreaks you gain perks and at 8 kills you unlock all the perks). There is also the MOAB, which is attained by getting 25 points in a row (kills from other killstreaks dont count, making Specialist the best option for people who aim for this). In addition, the newly added Kill Confirmed mode is one of the best ever made in the series (you win by obtaining a number of points for your team; points are gained by collecting tags dropped upon death by enemies; enemies can deny you tags by picking them from their fallen comrades). The multiplayer is pretty fun for a while, but it gets boring much faster than its predecessors, making the initial investment less worth it.\nHowever, the best component by far is Special Ops. It has missions that have no connection to the storyline of the game, but they are very enjoyable and can also be completed solo if one would want a more challenging experience. These are a blast and made me reminisce about the missions in CoDs past, surpassing their singleplayer counterparts. There is also a sort of horde mode, which pits against opponents that become tougher with each round that passes and you can buy weapons much like you could in the zombie modes in CoD WaW, BO and BO2.\nRegarding technical aspects, the game ran fairly well, rarely dropping frames, but it also doesn't have much graphical fidelity to show, sporting the same recycled game engine since CoD2. It somehow manages to look worse than its 2 closest predecessors, MW2 and BO.\nTo conclude, MW3 is a fairly mediocre game, even amongst its own series. Its campaign is shallow and painfully linear, the multiplayer is fun, but for a really short time and the game as a whole is hardly an improvement in any way over the games it succedes. If I were to rate it, I would give it a 6/10, a buy barely suited to the long time CoD fans, let alone the average gamer.","June 20, 2014","false","7.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The storyline was purely milked for grief with all the death in it. With soap dying and all these slo motion bulls*** death scenes, really created no badass moments for me personally in the game. I remember the campaign of MW2 front to back because of one small reason, it was actually good. Now you will see people crying over the death's of some in the game, but all the company will notice from me is 60 dollars less then their normal standard. The graphics are grainy and dissapointing to view. There was no uniqueness in any of the new guns and if there was any, it was a bad uniqueness.\n\n*MULTIPLAYER*\nNow the maps for mw3 to your surprise I actually didn't completely hate, as I watched how they urged a slightly 3-laned maps but slightly not was okay, but still ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. They maintained some of their secret ledges and spots that were on mw2 previously. But the influence of so many hackers shows that the company does not give two walking cat craps about their community base and they just wanted to push the game out for money. Also considering that its the PC copy doenst help much with the overall give-a-sh** level. The pc servers are mostly laggy and not satisfying to play on. The characters move too fast and it feels like your health level is lower than my expectations for black ops 3. The gun camos are all crappy and sandpapery. Along with the guns and the changes to them, they all seem the same like I said earlier and don't exemplify the right work being done when fired. They all ♥♥♥♥ me off when I shoot them and half the time lag and glitch and make me reload a few times before it works. Its all sandy and seems like they are just paper guns with some low quality texturing on it. For the DLC portion, they were so out of ideas for good maps that they had to bring back old maps to make people like their new game more. Why not make new maps that people will want to see more of instead of bring back the old ones like Terminal.\n\n*Spec ops*\nMW2 spec ops was alright but you can't expect people to like mediokre a second time. The missions were kind of boring and annoying to complete. I did enjoy the rank up system though that was a pretty cool feature that ties in with survival.\n\n*Survival*\nI didn't like it but at least it wasn't an early access open world survival gamemode.\n\nThis game is like dropping a cake on the ground and picking up all the pieces off the ground and putting it back on the plate and serving it. It seems like they just took the MW2 game files and erased the 2 and added a 3 but replaced the old maps with sh*t maps.\n\n4/10 Would rather play my Wii.","June 21, 2015","false","5.6"," 29 of 54 people (54%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","54","29","54","17","1"

Set in an authentic, believable environment, Modern Warfare 3 brings to bear open armed conflict in real life locales like never before. The streets, buildings, posters and magazines in the local vendors bring a new degree of realism to the monitor. The weapon effects are superb and the stealth is highly suspenseful.\n\nThe group dynamics are nigh on perfect. Each squad member coordinates expertely with the other and if you follow their lead and pick off enemies as they do, you can be a valuable member of the team. The enemy AI is challenging and will give you a hard time if you let them take cover and spread their numbers. Fortunately, your own and the advanced weapons at your disposal help even the odds nicely.\n\nModern Warfare polishes the game engine in all the right places and heightens the tension with expertly written sudden events that can lead to your death if you fail to act quickly enough. In story this installment helps to finally put an end to the Russian threat once and for all in a very satisfying manner. It can be tough, especially for those who are new to squad shooters, but to play the game and finish it is a very worthwhile and rewarding experience.","December 8, 2015","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can choose shield or weapon to wore at once.\n\nStory 9/10\nThe story continues from MW1 MW2 to MW3, the story is timeline, easy to understand, and reflects how the war should be. The story also filled with sad moments and plot twists\n\nMultiplayer 8/10\nI didn't try much the multiplayer, but so far so good\n\nCo-op gameplay 9/10\nI think the best feature of MW3 is it's 4 people co-op gameplay, not only you can play missions with 4 people, but also play survival, and unlike other survivals, this is not against zombies, but waves of attack, from soldier, dogs, juggernaut, helicopter, etc\n\nOverall: 8/10\nIf this is on a discount, and your pc is not so powerful, this game is worth it, but still good for powerful pc, tho.

The graphics are highly realistic, the maps are diversely different and well constructed and the many multiplayer gameplay modes can be altered to create even more custom gameplay modes! Weapon loadouts are very clearly organized and changing or creating your own custom loudouts is as easy as a few clicks. The choice of guns are great and the numerous gun modifications and upgrades make your weapons more personal and suited to your needs. Servers are created based on online players within a certain region who become automatically grouped together and a host is randomly chosen - which is a great idea because you never have to manually browse servers and you won't end up in a server by yourself! Achievements are as awesome as they can get and the slow-mo final killshot replay at the end of each round is epic - especially if it was you who made the kill!","June 24, 2014","true","12.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

As you'd expect with C.O.D. games this is a non-stop in yer face  killing fest, full of action and  amazing visuals.  The developer has added some interesting and varied missions that involve several  scenarios such as   scuba diving and manning a mini gun from a chopper while making your escape from  the first mission.  I've yet to explore the multiplayer aspect of the game (co-op for me), but then I tend to concentrate on the single player   parts of  a game first.  It's hard to  make a real comparison  between  MW3  and Battlefield 3, but  IMO  so far Battlefield 3  wins.  Although both single player campaigns are  rather scripted,  the battlefield  experience left me  feeling  lot more satisfied than the COD experience.  BF3 is a harder game with more of a feel of a real military sim than COD:MW3.  If you're into FPS games then both should be on your shopping list (if you don't already own them.  .

During deep diversion over group of fearless marines the submarine with evil Russians floats. The commander of office it is squeezed hisses in a handheld transceiver: "Not to move! " For harm (and with boredom) I nevertheless decide to swim for a while slightly... and right there I learn that it is impossible to move — for the period of a scene management is disconnected. Call of Duty left school old kind the zaskriptovannykh of the shooters which have promptly become fashionable after Half-Life. Certainly, authors the most noble motives — beautifully to make to players directed and to tell juicy, coherent story moreover and about war. In years this desire didn't weaken at all, but the methods, which set didn't change never in nine years, as a result finished series to the point of absurdity and idiotic scenes like that that is described slightly above. Our today's task — to try to understand as it turned out and what to do farther. That Modern Warfare 3 was on sale huge circulation — isn't surprising. First, Infinity Ward have strong standing on the feet multiplayer, and secondly, in the world still there are enough aged people from seven to seventy which didn't play enough in war. But in this review we would like to address not to them (they made the choice, you won't overpersuade), and to those who, as well as we, I saw during a century not one and not two Call of Duty, to those who testified all contemporary history of series and quite I acquired simple rules by which it works. For all of us Modern Warfare 3 — a heartrending experience. Actually matter isn't that at Infinity Ward bad game turned out. Modern Warfare 3 — it by and large at all game is simple. Games assume interactivity, any dialogue with the user and possibility of the last to influence the world created by developers. In Modern Warfare 3 you have four options: it is possible to run or not to run, and also to shoot or not to shoot. The rest game does all. Itself lets out in the field of new supernumeraries, itself arranges between them fights, itself blows up houses and breaks furniture... You need to run only in time in the right places, activating scripts. Once I made experiment: during hot firefight I sat down in a corner, it is simple not to stand absolutely in the firing line then rose because of the computer and I left the room of minutes on fifteen. Naturally, to my return me not that didn't kill — I as though didn't leave at all the room, firefight proceeded at the same speed and, it seems (precisely you won't tell, enemies as like as two peas), in the same structure. Heroes of Modern Warfare 3 even refuse to die if nearby there is no player. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).","March 2, 2014","true","2.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","2"

It is very dissapointing however. Many flaws of the previous titles still remain in the multiplayer, the community seems to be even worse and the campaign...is just dull.\nCoD: MW3 is not the worst in the franchise *coughGhostscough* but it's the last CoD game i had high expectations for...and it just failed to deliver them making it my most dissapointing Call of Duty so far. I pretty much gave up on Call of Duty after this title altho i still enjoyed Black Ops 2 alot and i'm still planning on buying Advanced Warfare.\nBut back to the review...\n\nThe Campaign\n\nSurprise! The campaign is 6-8h long even on the hardest difficulty! Who saw that coming, eh ? I'd usually whine about short singleplayer campaigns but in this case it's actually a good thing.\nMW3 campaign is soo boring and tedious that after the first couple of missions it just feels like a chore not something you would do for fun.\nThe storyline is trying to impress you too hard but it's actually just another shallow cliche story with one "oh my god! did they really just do that to HIM" moment.\nThe only characters in the game are Makarov, Soap and Price. Everyone else is just your typical soldiers with no backround.\n\nThe game also takes you all across Europe trying to mix up locations but every single country feels exactly the same. Modern Warfare 2 knew how to mix up levels: Stealthy snow section, hostage rescue on an oil rig, urban fighting in the U.S.A or guerilla fighting in shanty town. Sounds good ?\nWell, that's not what you'll get in this game. Just urban warfare in Europe and every city has the same looking buildings, same feel and...Well, the scenery won't change at all. The objectives are pretty much the same aswell.\nThe campaign is bland and dissapointing.\n5/10 at best.\n\nThe Co-op\nThis is where Modern Warfare 3 shines! It has different co-op missions with different objectives in it, just like in Modern Warfare 2.\nIt also adds a whole new Survival Mode and a leveling system. You can level up and unlock gear for the survival mode.\nEach survival map has it's each unique waves and "bosses".\n\nCo-op is what makes up for everything bad in the rest of the game. It's just that fun! ...If you have a friend to play it with. Otherwise forget about it.\n\n9/10 - Could be better.\n\nThe Multiplayer\nNot only is the singleplayer campaign worse than in MW1 and MW2. The multiplayer is quite similar to what MW2 had...Just a little bit worse.\nHowever, if you have to choose between playing multiplayer in here or in MW2 then choose MW3. Why ? It's easier to find matches in MW3, it has a (dead) server list and surprisingly less hacked lobbies.\n\nModern Warfare 3 used to have more hackers / hacked lobbies than MW2 but the tides have changed. Sure, this game has it's share of hackers. I've encountered at least 5 in my 79h of multiplayer gametime. But i've only seen 1 hacked lobby so far. You can at least double the numbers in MW2.\n\nThe map designs are pretty poor. The worst i've seen in a CoD game so far. There are like 2-3 good maps...Or should i say DECENT maps but the rest...They have nothing on the previous MW titles. Hell, even Blops and Blops2 have better maps in them.\nNoobtubes still remain as do last stand, riot shields, grenade spams and random knife "OH MY GAWD" kills.\nRussians and kids roam around screaming and yelling. If you do a bit better than everyone else in the lobby then you're a "confirmed hacker".\nIt's easier just to mute everyone as soon as you get into a lobby. Save yourself from the headache.\n\n7/10 - It's the worst multiplayer in the Modern Warfare series but it's still good, it's alive, has less hackers than in MW2 and Nukes can't finish matches.\n\nDo you want to play MW2 in multiplayer but hate hackers ? Get this game!\n\nOverall score: 7/10","July 14, 2015","true","16.4"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

The visuals are crisp enough and the atmosphere matches the tone and pace of the game perfectly. It feels like a world on the brink of annihilation. The audio adds to the feelings. From the guns firing to ambient effects all the way through the voice acting, it is superb and reflects well upon the art direction of the game.\n\nThe story, for me, was an incredible finish to a powerful story arc. From the battles in New York and Germany to the slog through Africa and the backalleys of Prague, the story is fast and powerful. The turn in Prague is especially gripping as two of my favorite characters, Soap and Kamarov, meet savage ends. It was at that moment I kept playing until I finished the campaign and killed Makarov. The decision to kill two key characters from MW and MW2 was powerful and gave me a sense of urgency to find the man responsible. Never have I felt such satisfaction from finishing a villain. The only other villian that gave me that much enjoyment from finally killing was Jack from Borderlands 2. Truly, the story board direction was top notch and I give them high praise for giving us a gripping, powerful and semi-cinematic experience to enjoy.\n\nHowever, I know everyone loves the multiplayer more than the story. Even in this department, there's no shortage of things to do. While nearly MW2 2.0, there's enough differences in perks, weapons and equipment to keep from being too stale. Thankfully, silliness like Danger Close and Stopping Power did not make a resurgence in this iteration. Overall, I've enjoyed the MW3 multiplayer more than MW2. There's more modes and arguably better balance.\n\nI fully recommend this title. If you play for the story, make sure you play Modern Warfare 1 and 2 so you're up to speed. For you multiplayer fans looking for a fast, furious game, this will not disappoint.","March 20, 2014","true","64.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As a Call of Duty fan since the original game, and avid supporter since the first PC release, I am deeply disappointed in this game. A game that was built on the, "nobody fights alone" motto, and featured rich and immersive single player games, has been utterly destroyed by this game. I beat this campaign in 4H 20M 59S and I am not "hardcore" gamer by any account. This game was rushed, of low quality, and hardly improved upon the last game, and was clearly made simply to make money, and not be an enjoyable game. And for that reason, and the lack of appreciation of what I as a fan would expect from a game of this caliber would like my money on this purchase refunded.","November 8, 2011","true","20.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

To be honest, from Infinity Ward it's still the same game. They made awesome titles like CoD 2, 4 or MW2. I liked it because the storyline was amazing. The engine upgrades and really cool multiplayer. It wasn't the same thing like now. But MW3 was just recycled CoD 4 with MW2 together. I liked it, enjoyed it and I also have +350 hours on multiplayer. It's really chatchy game.But I hate the community. Who wants to play with aimbotting kids, screaming in the voice chat and camping somewhere where you can't see them ? But that's multiplayer. Let's talk about campaign. It's the last Modern Warfare from thrilogy. What do you want to expect ? Awesome breath-taking missions ? Some kind of plot-twist in campaign ? Mindblowing actions ? No. They just killed the game. You will experience few "stealth" missions, shooting at some Africans, rescuing, and of course, grand finale. With few new characters, you will be basically for entire game, trying to save President and his daughter from Makarov's hands. There comes Chuck Norr..ehm..Captain Price with god-mode and kills everyone, without getting shot in the body. But what I enjoyed mostly is Spec Ops, which is also in MW2. Co-op missions are always fun with friend, but now there's brand new survival mode. But witout zombies. DLC 3 adds another game mode called Chaos, which is actually really big chaos and I like it. Kinda like survival, but faster. So I'm still recommending this game, but as I said, mostly for Spec Ops than campaign and MP.\n6/10","May 12, 2014","true","105.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Together with classic Call of Duty multi-character control, Modern Warfare 3 contains deep multiplayer support, including two-player Co-op Survival mode. The game also contains all-new Kill Streak categories and customizable strike packages that offer more options for player combat styles and strategies.\n\n'Modern Warfare 3 is pure perfection in gameplay and graphics, and it's only going to get better as more DLC arrives and the game is refined and balanced as the designers analyze real-time data from all the matches being played. There is no fan base more loyal than Call of Duty, and this game is guaranteed to delight all who play now and in the years to come.'\n\n'While the first two Modern Warfares proved to be the extraordinary work of a single, incredibly talented team, the third instalment in the series stands as a manifesto to what three great teams, working together as one passionate unit, can achieve. It's an improvement over its predecessor in pretty much every aspect and a return to former strength after the stagnation that was MW 2. Sledgehammer and Infinity Ward deliver a natural conclusion to an astounding trilogy - and the best Call of duty since the first Modern Warfare.'","July 6, 2014","true","45.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As a Call of Duty fan since the original game, and avid supporter since the first PC release, I am deeply disappointed in this game. A game that was built on the, "nobody fights alone" motto, and featured rich and immersive single player games, has been utterly destroyed by this game. I beat this campaign in 4H 20M 59S and I am not "hardcore" gamer by any account. This game was rushed, of low quality, and hardly improved upon the last game, and was clearly made simply to make money, and not be an enjoyable game. And for that reason, and the lack of appreciation of what I as a fan would expect from a game of this caliber would like my money on this purchase refunded.","November 8, 2011","true","20.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

To be honest, from Infinity Ward it's still the same game. They made awesome titles like CoD 2, 4 or MW2. I liked it because the storyline was amazing. The engine upgrades and really cool multiplayer. It wasn't the same thing like now. But MW3 was just recycled CoD 4 with MW2 together. I liked it, enjoyed it and I also have +350 hours on multiplayer. It's really chatchy game.But I hate the community. Who wants to play with aimbotting kids, screaming in the voice chat and camping somewhere where you can't see them ? But that's multiplayer. Let's talk about campaign. It's the last Modern Warfare from thrilogy. What do you want to expect ? Awesome breath-taking missions ? Some kind of plot-twist in campaign ? Mindblowing actions ? No. They just killed the game. You will experience few "stealth" missions, shooting at some Africans, rescuing, and of course, grand finale. With few new characters, you will be basically for entire game, trying to save President and his daughter from Makarov's hands. There comes Chuck Norr..ehm..Captain Price with god-mode and kills everyone, without getting shot in the body. But what I enjoyed mostly is Spec Ops, which is also in MW2. Co-op missions are always fun with friend, but now there's brand new survival mode. But witout zombies. DLC 3 adds another game mode called Chaos, which is actually really big chaos and I like it. Kinda like survival, but faster. So I'm still recommending this game, but as I said, mostly for Spec Ops than campaign and MP.\n6/10","May 12, 2014","true","105.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Secondly, I do not recommend purchasing a PC version of any Call of Duty after CoD 4 (lack of FoV sliders and foremost the hackers). If you do, however, make sure you buy a copy in a retail store, because the price tag of $60 on Steam is way overpriced.\nWith the bad stuff out of the way, I have to say, that MW3 is my favorite CoD, on par with 2 and 4, if we talk about CoDs until Ghosts. The campaign is short but intense with some memorable missions and good ol' Captain Price. It is linear, but it doesnt ruin the experience like Battlefield 3 or Homefront do.\nThe main fun of CoDs is in the multiplayer. Theres been some serious balance tweaking from MW2 and although some of the current balance issues will seemingly never get properly resolved (namely MP7, ACR and the FMG9 Akimbo weapons) its still a much more balanced experience than MW2 was. The maps are well designed for the most part and have some nice variation of settings. The killstreaks are fun and while there is no Ghosts doggy killstreak, the Reaper or Stealth Bomber are very cool to get. There is not a lot of change in the perks. Its only unfortunate that the hackers on the PC version are more than common.","December 5, 2011","true","29.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Quite possibly the last of the Modern Warfare series. MW3 is kind of on the borderline between the good CODs and the bad CODs. If you wish to finish the series, by all means give it a go. However, if you are buying this just for the heck of it, don't (wait a few years). Instead, try MW1. I will not refer to the campain; I could accidently spoil something. The multiplayer is well rounded, although i do think that maps should be larger and spawns more reasonable (trust me; they are terrible). Overall, I believe that this is a well rounded game, again, right on that borderline.","February 21, 2014","true","32.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Vooral het aspect van de multiplayer spreekt me erg aan. Veel professionele gamers die op de top van hun kunnen een potje team deathmatch spelen. Ook moet ik zeggen dat PEGI hun werk ook fantastisch heeft gedaan. Er zijn geen kinderen in dit spel te bekennen en dit is natuurlijk heel erg logisch, oorlog voeren is geen spelletje en al helemaal niet voor kinderen. Dit spel is uitermate geschikt als je even een relaxed op een zondagmiddag een leuke shooter wilt zonder dat je gestrest raakt. Ik hoop dat u mijn review informatief danwel nuttig heeft ondervonden, zo niet, dan hoor ik het graag van u.\n\nMet vriendelijke groet,\n\nKikkers.","February 18, 2014","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It has evolutionized the genre and changed the way we play and think of FPS games. Althought, the game adds nothing new to the already complex formula, it does adds smoothness to the game core mechanics and the fast paced arcade-style shooter, ranking & rewarding as well as unique kill streak system in which skillful players shall go on a rampage quite easily with the aid of air supports or ground fire powers.\n\nThe thrid entry to the series does not dissappoint because the single player campaign is filled with action as well as intense sequences. The story is well written and completed the story in a consistent and well told narrative. It also did a great job on connecting all the previous games together while maintaining twists that will keep the player guessing with unpredictably deep story. The story mode does not have a good replayability unless you are a collection fanatic that will be interested in perfecting the game with enemy intels, other wise I'd say it is not worth the hassle.\n\nThe music score is an honorable mention here as the composer Brian Tayler has really hit the score with the music on the battlefield as well as the impact of guns and bullets hitting different places. The sound track is overall excellent not only does it set a atmospherical environment but it also connects the emotional link between the players and the characters and maintaining this link is what gives us the reason to care about the characters.\n\nIn terms of multiplayer, the same formula applies. It is still addictive and still fun as new weapons and maps being added but the only down side to that is that additional DLCs will cost a fortune.\n\nOverall I will recommend this game to all FPS lovers and action gamers in general.","March 6, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's nothing cloneworthy about this entry in the Call of Duty franchise as you fight back the Russian invasion in the United States and slog through varied environments with Price and Soap while you hunt for Makarov across the globe. The visuals are crisp enough and the atmosphere matches the tone and pace of the game perfectly. It feels like a world on the brink of annihilation. The audio adds to the feelings. From the guns firing to ambient effects all the way through the voice acting, it is superb and reflects well upon the art direction of the game.\n\nThe story, for me, was an incredible finish to a powerful story arc. From the battles in New York and Germany to the slog through Africa and the backalleys of Prague, the story is fast and powerful. The turn in Prague is especially gripping as two of my favorite characters, Soap and Kamarov, meet savage ends. It was at that moment I kept playing until I finished the campaign and killed Makarov. The decision to kill two key characters from MW and MW2 was powerful and gave me a sense of urgency to find the man responsible. Never have I felt such satisfaction from finishing a villain. The only other villian that gave me that much enjoyment from finally killing was Jack from Borderlands 2. Truly, the story board direction was top notch and I give them high praise for giving us a gripping, powerful and semi-cinematic experience to enjoy.\n\nHowever, I know everyone loves the multiplayer more than the story. Even in this department, there's no shortage of things to do. While nearly MW2 2.0, there's enough differences in perks, weapons and equipment to keep from being too stale. Thankfully, silliness like Danger Close and Stopping Power did not make a resurgence in this iteration. Overall, I've enjoyed the MW3 multiplayer more than MW2. There's more modes and arguably better balance.\n\nI fully recommend this title. If you play for the story, make sure you play Modern Warfare 1 and 2 so you're up to speed. For you multiplayer fans looking for a fast, furious game, this will not disappoint.","March 20, 2014","true","64.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're a fellow Single Player like me, there's really only 2 things drawing you to this game- that's the campaign and the Spec Ops Missions, many of which are playable as Single Player, with a few co-op missions added in as well. The campaign can be completed in around 4 hours, little longer if you're hunting intel or other achievements. Spec Ops missions are where the fun is at though. They require more skill than the campaign.\n\n*Now I don't play mp- but from what I've heard, it's a camp-fest full of aimbotters, quick-scopers and the like. Kind of an 'enter at your own risk' mode. I have heard of many gamers that strictly bought it for the mp disgusted with it and regretting their purchase - so 'buyer be ware' applies more than usual here.\n\nThe ultimate question is, 'do you think you can have enough fun/time with this game to make it worthy of the price?'.

It contains alot of content with his in depth Multiplayer and Co-Op that can easily suck you in. If you played the previous titles in this series you might end up like I did - getting that feeling the you already had a familiar experience before, the multiplayer felt pretty dull after the 40 hours mark so I started orginazing matches with friends and even against other clans, which has a pleasure - the good old shooting mechanics feel as good as always and never get's old. Still, the game doesn't feels worth it's value.\n\nThe Singleplayer is a great additive, nice story that wind up the MW series with it's unforgetable ending, yet as expexted it's very short, but the Spec Ops missions and the survival mode got it covered, they a huge fun even on solo. A partner to the Spec Ops is a delight, but I felt the game lacked a 4-players Co-Op.\n\nI do reccommend the game, but if you are willing to buy it now, do yourself a favor and wait for a discount, and I seggust you to buy it with some friends.","November 19, 2011","true","95.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Quite possibly the last of the Modern Warfare series. MW3 is kind of on the borderline between the good CODs and the bad CODs. If you wish to finish the series, by all means give it a go. However, if you are buying this just for the heck of it, don't (wait a few years). Instead, try MW1. I will not refer to the campain; I could accidently spoil something. The multiplayer is well rounded, although i do think that maps should be larger and spawns more reasonable (trust me; they are terrible). Overall, I believe that this is a well rounded game, again, right on that borderline.","February 21, 2014","true","32.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GamesAmongOtherThings/recommended/42680/","GamesAmongOtherThings","SnowwAxius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GamesAmongOtherThings/","146 products in account","One of the best call of duties in the world. I'll even put a huge list going through whats good about the game mechanics and certain modes...\n\n\n----\nTo start this off, I want to begin by saying that if you are a complete noob to call of duty, you may either want to completely avoid or spend a lot of time in this game. The guns ARE noob friendly (heavily overpowered) but thats not always a good thing when your enemies have OP weapons. Anyway, the final decision for buying this IS up to you, so i'll leave that part to you.\n----\nCampaign\n\nCampaign has a decent story, i've never really enjoyed campaign personally.\n----\nMultiplayer\n\nMultiplayer is probabaly the best part of this game, 80 ranks to level up to, and just a lot of fun to be had.\n\n----\nSpecial Ops/Survival\n\nSpecial Ops Is OK, they have some decent missions on there that are quite fun to play.\n\nSurvival is probabally my second favorite function of MW3, it is real fun to see how long you can last against increasingly difficult odds.\n----\nMAPS/GAMEMODES\n\nSome maps are bad, (Carbon) some maps are good (Arkaden, Seatown, Dome)\nBut if your good at COD, most of the maps won't be a problem.\n\nGAMEMODES (that I feel should be covered in this review)\nDropzone\nInfected\nMercenary\nSearch And Destroy\nKill Confirmed\n\n\nDROPZONE\nn Drop Zone, two teams must fight over a moving location on the map (marked with Care Package Marker smoke) to gain points. It differentiates itself from an ordinary King of the Hill gametype, however, with the addition of Care Packages as a reward for successfully holding on to the point. Approximately every 15 seconds a team holds a zone, a Care Package, an Airdrop Trap (in MW3), an Emergency Airdrop (notably NOT normally available under other circumstances), or a Juggernaut/Juggernaut Recon delivered via C-130 will be called automatically on the drop zone. To win, either one team must reach the score limit, or else the victor is determined by who has the most points when time is up.\n\nINFECTED\nThe game starts with all players being survivors. In the upper left hand corner of the screen, there is a timer that starts with nine seconds counting down to the Infected. After the nine seconds, one player is randomly chosen to be first infected.  The survivors are the players who are not infected, hence the name "Survivors". The surviving players must hide from and kill the Infected to try and survive until time runs out; each game lasts five minutes. The Survivors spawn with an unknown weapon (depending on what the custom settings are) and must survive by killing the Infected or hiding. 50 points are given to Survivors every time a Survivor is Infected. The name given with the points is "Survivor". The round ends when either the last Survivor is killed/infected, or time runs out, and the new round will start pending on a new player to be infected.\n\nMercenary\n\nThe mercenary gamemode is completely and totally dead. Sorry, folks.\n\nSEARCH & DESTROY\nA one-sided game mode, the goal is for an attacking side to either eliminate the defending team or detonate either one of two bomb sites. Players only get one life per round, with most versions of the mode going to a best-of-seven rounds (first to four rounds wins). There is an intermission/half when two or three rounds are completed.\n\nKILL CONFIRMED\nPlayers drop their dogtags upon death, appearing bright yellow for the killer's team and as bright red for the victim's team. The player's team gets a score for confirming the kill by collecting the dogtags, which awards the killer 50 XP (alongside the XP rewarded from the kill) as well as the player who confirmed it. The player may also deny teammates' deaths in the same fashion for the same 50 XP (250 XP if the tags were the player's own), but denying a kill does not add to the team score. However, it prevents the enemy from confirming it. Collecting a dogtag does not contribute to the player's Pointstreak.\n\nALL IN ALL\n10/10\nOne of the best Call Of Duties.\n\n-SnowCriticz\n\n\nPsst. Buy it at gamestop. They have it for cheaper. Usually.","December 27, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're a fellow Single Player like me, there's really only 2 things drawing you to this game- that's the campaign and the Spec Ops Missions, many of which are playable as Single Player, with a few co-op missions added in as well. The campaign can be completed in around 4 hours, little longer if you're hunting intel or other achievements. Spec Ops missions are where the fun is at though. They require more skill than the campaign.\n\n*Now I don't play mp- but from what I've heard, it's a camp-fest full of aimbotters, quick-scopers and the like. Kind of an 'enter at your own risk' mode. I have heard of many gamers that strictly bought it for the mp disgusted with it and regretting their purchase - so 'buyer be ware' applies more than usual here.\n\nThe ultimate question is, 'do you think you can have enough fun/time with this game to make it worthy of the price?'. For me, it was easier. This game shows in my Steam games, but I bought the physical disc- with coupons/cheaper.","May 15, 2012","true","46.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evo_benjin_2/recommended/42680/","evo_benjin_2","Anonymous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evo_benjin_2/","11 products in account","Pros:\nThe same great action of the previous games. Lots of multiplayer options.\n\nCons:\nNot much changed since Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Single-player campaign is confusing for people who haven't played the other Modern Warfare games.\n\nModern Warfare 3 picks up where Modern Warfare 2 left off. I mean, exactly where it left off. Russia is at war with America, Makarov is at large, Soap's injured, and everything is blowing up. If you didn't play Modern Warfare 2, which served as a decent starting point and didn't require the first game to understand it, you won't have any idea about what's going on, and the game doesn't do much to get you up to date. It feels very much like the third movie in a trilogy, and the second movie ended on a cliffhanger.\n\nThe gameplay, both in single player and multiplayer modes, is identical to that of Modern Warfare 2. You can carry two weapons and two types of grenades (one offensive, one special) at one time and you have to hide behind cover and employ tactical savvy in your approach firefights if you want to kill your enemies. It's an established and functional style that captures modern, "realistic" first-person shooter games. If you get hit a few times, you need to hide behind cover until you heal, or a few more stray bullets can kill you. It's unforgiving, but balanced.\n\nMultiplayer is the big draw of Modern Warfare 3, and it pays off just as much as it did in the other games in the series. There are the same seemingly endless customization options, with an experience system and the ability to build your own class with different weapons and abilities. The killstreak system from previous games has been refined into a points-based system that gives players more balance. Instead of getting points for each kill, players can choose Assault, Support, and Specialist modes that give them different rewards. Assault is the traditional killstreak system, where you get new abilities like missile strikes for more kills in a single life. Support counts your kills and other actions between lives, constantly moving up and giving you support-based abilities like UAVs. Specialist gives you more perks for your kills, instead of new weapons it effectively turns you into a super-soldier who's faster, stronger, or able to take more damage.\n\nThe multiplayer options offer a benefit over Battlefield 3, which only has six cooperative missions compared to over a dozen in Modern Warfare 3. Competitive play is pretty evenly matched, with leveling in Modern Warfare 3 universal and steadily unlocking weapons and skills and leveling in Battlefield 3 and rewarding your class as you play it. The big difference between the two games is that Battlefield 3 has vehicles, which can change the nature of a game dramatically. To go to extremes, Modern Warfare 3 is more suitable for Counter-Strike fans, while Battlefield 3 is more suitable for Halo fans, but the distinction between the two modern combat games are far smaller than the rift between the two classic shooters.\n\nModern Warfare 3 is a solid follow-up to Modern Warfare 2 and Black Ops, and if you loved those games you'll love this one. It doesn't change anything big, and the single-player campaign wraps up a story with most of the exposition lodged in previous games, but it offers a great multiplayer experience and a solid, if predictable and occasionally frustrating, single-player experience.\n","October 21, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is it.\n\nTrademark blockbuster explosions and action? Check.\nTrademark graphics? Check.\nSymphonic score and full orchestra to accompany explosions? Check.\nNo silly spacesuits, jumpsuits or gravity guns? Check.\nMissions take place in a variety of locations, from Sierra Leone to the UK.\n\nNotable missions include:\n-  playing SAS at the warehouse. Love those hammy British accents and LIttle Bird Helicopters.\n-  Operating the Hind remote machine gun.\n-  fighting through Paris\n-  calling in artillery strikes with purple smoke\n-  operating the AC-130 Gunship in Paris\n\nThe Special Ops section is where things get stupid fast.\n\nThe Solo survival missions are beyond dumb. The AI are bullet sponges and you barely have enough time to buy new weapons and ammo. It gets boring fast.\n\nPlaying Advanced Warfare for me meant a big break from what COD meant. Not a fan of the newer releases which are too tech-oriented and futuristic.\n\nThe campaign is a bit short but given teh amount of explosions, battles, cinematic cut scenes is well worth it, but only if you manage to buy it elsewhere on sale.\n\nGot this for 9$ onsale on ♥♥♥. Not worth the 43$ on steamb but if you find it elsewhere definitely consider getting it.","March 28","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

MW2 had some rather annoying balancing quirks, and Ghosts was a dismal failure, as far as I'm concerned. But of course, one ought not to forget the modern classic in the form of the first MW, which was a true phenomenon.\n\nMW3 just like any MW had impressive map designs. Some may call it straightforward, but it's a proven philosophy as per the first MW. Contrast this with Treyarch's map design, which the word "maze" should properly sum it all up. Sledgehammer on the other hand seems to be taking the middle road but I reckon it's more identical to Treyarch's.\n\nThen let's talk about weapons and killstreaks. Recoil is pretty much non-existence so that makes it accessible to couch gamers on consoles. For the PC, do expect faster response time and reflexes as usual. The killstreak system is probably the best part of this game, allowing one to select how he/she would earn those killstreaks.\n\nOverall, MW3 is a commendable COD title. If you plan to pick this one up, well you're in luck to know that there are still players out there.","May 26, 2015","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game , has everything what MW2 had , but this has even more.\nThe Story starts after MW2 , and continoues the "adventure" of John Price and Soap.In this game , you play with tons of characters. Buut there are lot of problems! You only play Soap for like 3 minute or less :( , after that , he always gonna be an A.I. The Main playable character is Yuri and Frost ( hohohoho :D ). Yuri is an Ex-Spetnas soldier , who helps Soap and Price to hunt down Makarov. Frost is a Delta force soldier assigned to Team Metal. there are other characters like the british Marcus "Burns" , an another Russian operator wich i cant remember..the story is pretty good in the game! same as MW2 , there are lot of epic moments! In overall , story is awesome! now , theres the Spec Ops mode from MW2 , but its been modified a bit. now there's 2 kind of things you can do : "Missions" ( like in MW2 ) and "Survival"\nboth these can be done in coop , but Survival..man..that mode is a bless from the gods!\nAbout Multiplayer , i think this is the best CoD MW multi , i like to play it!\nLets see the results\n\nPositives :\n-Awesome Story and characters\n-Some characters from CoD4MW are in this game!!\n-Personal best MW\n-A nice end to the Modern Warfare series\n\nNegatives :\n-Graphics look outdated , even worse then MW2\n-Many questions unanswered\n-Only can play Soap for 3 minutes :(\n\nmy final score for MW3 is a 9/10 ! i find this game to be good! get it on a sale or CD version :D on Steam every CoD is high priced","January 2","true","42.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game , has everything what MW2 had , but this has even more.\nThe Story starts after MW2 , and continoues the "adventure" of John Price and Soap.In this game , you play with tons of characters. Buut there are lot of problems! You only play Soap for like 3 minute or less :( , after that , he always gonna be an A.I. The Main playable character is Yuri and Frost ( hohohoho :D ). Yuri is an Ex-Spetnas soldier , who helps Soap and Price to hunt down Makarov. Frost is a Delta force soldier assigned to Team Metal. there are other characters like the british Marcus "Burns" , an another Russian operator wich i cant remember..the story is pretty good in the game! same as MW2 , there are lot of epic moments! In overall , story is awesome! now , theres the Spec Ops mode from MW2 , but its been modified a bit. now there's 2 kind of things you can do : "Missions" ( like in MW2 ) and "Survival"\nboth these can be done in coop , but Survival..man..that mode is a bless from the gods!\nAbout Multiplayer , i think this is the best CoD MW multi , i like to play it!\nLets see the results\n\nPositives :\n-Awesome Story and characters\n-Some characters from CoD4MW are in this game!!\n-Personal best MW\n-A nice end to the Modern Warfare series\n\nNegatives :\n-Graphics look outdated , even worse then MW2\n-Many questions unanswered\n-Only can play Soap for 3 minutes :(\n\nmy final score for MW3 is a 9/10 ! i find this game to be good! get it on a sale or CD version :D on Steam every CoD is high priced","January 2","true","42.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GamesAmongOtherThings/recommended/42680/","GamesAmongOtherThings","SnowwAxius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GamesAmongOtherThings/","146 products in account","One of the best call of duties in the world. I'll even put a huge list going through whats good about the game mechanics and certain modes...\n\n\n----\nTo start this off, I want to begin by saying that if you are a complete noob to call of duty, you may either want to completely avoid or spend a lot of time in this game. The guns ARE noob friendly (heavily overpowered) but thats not always a good thing when your enemies have OP weapons. Anyway, the final decision for buying this IS up to you, so i'll leave that part to you.\n----\nCampaign\n\nCampaign has a decent story, i've never really enjoyed campaign personally.\n----\nMultiplayer\n\nMultiplayer is probabaly the best part of this game, 80 ranks to level up to, and just a lot of fun to be had.\n\n----\nSpecial Ops/Survival\n\nSpecial Ops Is OK, they have some decent missions on there that are quite fun to play.\n\nSurvival is probabally my second favorite function of MW3, it is real fun to see how long you can last against increasingly difficult odds.\n----\nMAPS/GAMEMODES\n\nSome maps are bad, (Carbon) some maps are good (Arkaden, Seatown, Dome)\nBut if your good at COD, most of the maps won't be a problem.\n\nGAMEMODES (that I feel should be covered in this review)\nDropzone\nInfected\nMercenary\nSearch And Destroy\nKill Confirmed\n\n\nDROPZONE\nn Drop Zone, two teams must fight over a moving location on the map (marked with Care Package Marker smoke) to gain points. It differentiates itself from an ordinary King of the Hill gametype, however, with the addition of Care Packages as a reward for successfully holding on to the point. Approximately every 15 seconds a team holds a zone, a Care Package, an Airdrop Trap (in MW3), an Emergency Airdrop (notably NOT normally available under other circumstances), or a Juggernaut/Juggernaut Recon delivered via C-130 will be called automatically on the drop zone. To win, either one team must reach the score limit, or else the victor is determined by who has the most points when time is up.\n\nINFECTED\nThe game starts with all players being survivors. In the upper left hand corner of the screen, there is a timer that starts with nine seconds counting down to the Infected. After the nine seconds, one player is randomly chosen to be first infected.  The survivors are the players who are not infected, hence the name "Survivors". The surviving players must hide from and kill the Infected to try and survive until time runs out; each game lasts five minutes. The Survivors spawn with an unknown weapon (depending on what the custom settings are) and must survive by killing the Infected or hiding. 50 points are given to Survivors every time a Survivor is Infected. The name given with the points is "Survivor". The round ends when either the last Survivor is killed/infected, or time runs out, and the new round will start pending on a new player to be infected.\n\nMercenary\n\nThe mercenary gamemode is completely and totally dead. Sorry, folks.\n\nSEARCH & DESTROY\nA one-sided game mode, the goal is for an attacking side to either eliminate the defending team or detonate either one of two bomb sites. Players only get one life per round, with most versions of the mode going to a best-of-seven rounds (first to four rounds wins). There is an intermission/half when two or three rounds are completed.\n\nKILL CONFIRMED\nPlayers drop their dogtags upon death, appearing bright yellow for the killer's team and as bright red for the victim's team. The player's team gets a score for confirming the kill by collecting the dogtags, which awards the killer 50 XP (alongside the XP rewarded from the kill) as well as the player who confirmed it. The player may also deny teammates' deaths in the same fashion for the same 50 XP (250 XP if the tags were the player's own), but denying a kill does not add to the team score. However, it prevents the enemy from confirming it. Collecting a dogtag does not contribute to the player's Pointstreak.\n\nALL IN ALL\n10/10\nOne of the best Call Of Duties.\n\n-SnowCriticz\n\n\nPsst. Buy it at gamestop. They have it for cheaper. Usually.","December 27, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GamesAmongOtherThings/recommended/42680/","GamesAmongOtherThings","SnowwAxius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GamesAmongOtherThings/","146 products in account","One of the best call of duties in the world. I'll even put a huge list going through whats good about the game mechanics and certain modes...\n\n\n----\nTo start this off, I want to begin by saying that if you are a complete noob to call of duty, you may either want to completely avoid or spend a lot of time in this game. The guns ARE noob friendly (heavily overpowered) but thats not always a good thing when your enemies have OP weapons. Anyway, the final decision for buying this IS up to you, so i'll leave that part to you.\n----\nCampaign\n\nCampaign has a decent story, i've never really enjoyed campaign personally.\n----\nMultiplayer\n\nMultiplayer is probabaly the best part of this game, 80 ranks to level up to, and just a lot of fun to be had.\n\n----\nSpecial Ops/Survival\n\nSpecial Ops Is OK, they have some decent missions on there that are quite fun to play.\n\nSurvival is probabally my second favorite function of MW3, it is real fun to see how long you can last against increasingly difficult odds.\n----\nMAPS/GAMEMODES\n\nSome maps are bad, (Carbon) some maps are good (Arkaden, Seatown, Dome)\nBut if your good at COD, most of the maps won't be a problem.\n\nGAMEMODES (that I feel should be covered in this review)\nDropzone\nInfected\nMercenary\nSearch And Destroy\nKill Confirmed\n\n\nDROPZONE\nn Drop Zone, two teams must fight over a moving location on the map (marked with Care Package Marker smoke) to gain points. It differentiates itself from an ordinary King of the Hill gametype, however, with the addition of Care Packages as a reward for successfully holding on to the point. Approximately every 15 seconds a team holds a zone, a Care Package, an Airdrop Trap (in MW3), an Emergency Airdrop (notably NOT normally available under other circumstances), or a Juggernaut/Juggernaut Recon delivered via C-130 will be called automatically on the drop zone. To win, either one team must reach the score limit, or else the victor is determined by who has the most points when time is up.\n\nINFECTED\nThe game starts with all players being survivors. In the upper left hand corner of the screen, there is a timer that starts with nine seconds counting down to the Infected. After the nine seconds, one player is randomly chosen to be first infected.  The survivors are the players who are not infected, hence the name "Survivors". The surviving players must hide from and kill the Infected to try and survive until time runs out; each game lasts five minutes. The Survivors spawn with an unknown weapon (depending on what the custom settings are) and must survive by killing the Infected or hiding. 50 points are given to Survivors every time a Survivor is Infected. The name given with the points is "Survivor". The round ends when either the last Survivor is killed/infected, or time runs out, and the new round will start pending on a new player to be infected.\n\nMercenary\n\nThe mercenary gamemode is completely and totally dead. Sorry, folks.\n\nSEARCH & DESTROY\nA one-sided game mode, the goal is for an attacking side to either eliminate the defending team or detonate either one of two bomb sites. Players only get one life per round, with most versions of the mode going to a best-of-seven rounds (first to four rounds wins). There is an intermission/half when two or three rounds are completed.\n\nKILL CONFIRMED\nPlayers drop their dogtags upon death, appearing bright yellow for the killer's team and as bright red for the victim's team. The player's team gets a score for confirming the kill by collecting the dogtags, which awards the killer 50 XP (alongside the XP rewarded from the kill) as well as the player who confirmed it. The player may also deny teammates' deaths in the same fashion for the same 50 XP (250 XP if the tags were the player's own), but denying a kill does not add to the team score. However, it prevents the enemy from confirming it. Collecting a dogtag does not contribute to the player's Pointstreak.\n\nALL IN ALL\n10/10\nOne of the best Call Of Duties.\n\n-SnowCriticz\n\n\nPsst. Buy it at gamestop. They have it for cheaper. Usually.","December 27, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It delivers a good story, fun to use guns, and a theater of combat and action to fight through. You know what to expect in the SP campaign, the story & voice acting are good, the levels are entertaining.\n\n-Spec Ops originally had a problem with desyncing that has been fixed, making it possible to finish with an advanced option video frame sync option (can you believe the default choice is set to ruin the game?).\n\n-Survival is actually very fun, unlike boring ♥♥♥ black ops zombie mode.  The Spec ops missions are a lot of fun & a huge draw in this game, the first 3 DLC packs add more spec ops missions which are also lots of fun and a lot harder than the regular levels sometimes.\n\nFor what this game aims to be, it accomplishes that.  Having fixed the desyncing spec ops issue, I can say it was a 10/10 for what I expected & what was delivered, but I understand a lot of people are sick of the CoD model.  I don't mess around in MP, so I rate this as someone who enjoys SP campaigns & coop.","March 16, 2013","true","46.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

MW2 had some rather annoying balancing quirks, and Ghosts was a dismal failure, as far as I'm concerned. But of course, one ought not to forget the modern classic in the form of the first MW, which was a true phenomenon.\n\nMW3 just like any MW had impressive map designs. Some may call it straightforward, but it's a proven philosophy as per the first MW. Contrast this with Treyarch's map design, which the word "maze" should properly sum it all up. Sledgehammer on the other hand seems to be taking the middle road but I reckon it's more identical to Treyarch's.\n\nThen let's talk about weapons and killstreaks. Recoil is pretty much non-existence so that makes it accessible to couch gamers on consoles. For the PC, do expect faster response time and reflexes as usual. The killstreak system is probably the best part of this game, allowing one to select how he/she would earn those killstreaks.\n\nOverall, MW3 is a commendable COD title. If you plan to pick this one up, well you're in luck to know that there are still players out there.","May 26, 2015","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoDjMike/recommended/42680/","GoDjMike","GoDjMike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoDjMike/","81 products in account","I have played the entirety of the Modern Warfare series a good 5 times over. A good 1000+ hours spend on Modern Warfare, 400+ spent on Modern Warfare 2, and under 50 hours on Modern Warfare 3. I played competitively in multiplayer for both Modern Warfare and Modern Warfare 2, but not the 3rd installment, with good reason. The quality of the game slowly degrades between these installments. Surprisingly to me, the average consumer doesn't seem to notice the changes in game mechanics througout the series. Regardless, I have a few points to make about this series in this review.\n\nIn the past week, I played through the entire campaigns of MW, MW2 and MW3 on Veteran difficulty. The first impression that comes to mind is this: the most difficult of the 3, on the highest difficulty possible, is MW. MW also happens to have the most compelling story line, as well as the most difficult mission: the flashback mission of Price and MacMillan in Chernobyl. Hands down, with my rather diverse and expansive gaming experience, my favorite mission/scene/short-story of any game, of all time. *Spoiler here* I am still upset that Soap died near the end of this game. No one likes Yuri until the very last scene of the game as there is absolutely zero characterization for him when introduced. Also...isn't it a little redundant to have Soap almost killed once and then killed the next time? I feel like he would be a bit more cautious even ini the chaos of a war-zone.\n\nGraphically speaking, MW was not a beautiful game...but it was certainly well put together- especially for 2007. MW2 in the same regard, was stunning. The game looked amazing- and it still does in all aspects. MW3, however, is a little different. In the opening sequence of the campaign, images are displayed on broken shards of glass, and it has the potential to look really cool. Although, even running this game with the highest quality settings possible- on a gaming-specific rig- it looks pixelated and rather horrible, even.\n\nNow for gameplay mechanics. MW reminds me a lot of Counter Strike: Source and Global Offensive in many ways. The controls are very ridig, snap-to, and reaction based. The weapon-balancing *still* needs work as grenades (although realistically...) seem to end all life in sight. The killstreaks are solid and default for everyone, and PC maps like Killzone compensates for the shortcomings of default killstreaks making matches run long. MW2 is similar, but a lot more smooth. Going prone doesn't sound like you dropped a tank on the ground, and aiming down the sights allowed you more freedom to ADS in the dark (while scope was black) and adjust based on a gut feeling. In single player, MW2 only had one or two flaws. Certain areas where one would get stuck if you jumped on top of, but nothing that was glaringly annoying. MW3 is much different. It feels like a cartoon. If you sit and shoot nothing, zero enemies are shot- even when you have two tanks with you and the entire "Metal" squad by your side. Very unlikely. Also: it is *very* important to note the following: comparing the 3 MW games side by side by side...MW3 Veteran difficulty is very easy. I don't understand why. It seems to take merely 2 bullets- shot at anyone, anywhere- to take down an enemy. It also seems as though the missions as the British SAS in the middle of MW3's campaign make the mechanics even more odd. You have much less HP than other parts of the game (of course excluding the beginning of the last mission in juggernaut suits). You die much more easily, have very low powered weapons (a silenced MP5 and an M99/USP? What? Weak.), and have even more incompetent "teammates."\n\nThe first MW game was an absolute masterpiece which I will play again, again, and again. I would buy it again each and every time I decide to play it more on both Single and Multiplayer. That is a game to be treasured, and remember. As Infinity Ward split losing Jason West- it seems the quality of games also left. From the trailer I saw of CoD: Advanced Warfare- it seems Sledgehammer Games is the sole developer. Interesting.\n\nAs a whole, MW3 is just not worth purchasing. In fact, after making that purchase a few years ago, I wish I could fall in love with this game the way I did with MW and MW2. But, it did not happen, and will not happen. I am a fan of Call of Duty...and even in defending this franchise against Red Orchestra, Killing Floor, Counter Strike and Battlefield...I cannot bring myself to justify purchasing this game. It is quite simply not worth your money. What needs to happen is a return to the original game. When that happens, I will gladly praise it. For now, this will have to be reality.","May 3, 2014","false","23.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is it.\n\nTrademark blockbuster explosions and action? Check.\nTrademark graphics? Check.\nSymphonic score and full orchestra to accompany explosions? Check.\nNo silly spacesuits, jumpsuits or gravity guns? Check.\nMissions take place in a variety of locations, from Sierra Leone to the UK.\n\nNotable missions include:\n-  playing SAS at the warehouse. Love those hammy British accents and LIttle Bird Helicopters.\n-  Operating the Hind remote machine gun.\n-  fighting through Paris\n-  calling in artillery strikes with purple smoke\n-  operating the AC-130 Gunship in Paris\n\nThe Special Ops section is where things get stupid fast.\n\nThe Solo survival missions are beyond dumb. The AI are bullet sponges and you barely have enough time to buy new weapons and ammo. It gets boring fast.\n\nPlaying Advanced Warfare for me meant a big break from what COD meant. Not a fan of the newer releases which are too tech-oriented and futuristic.\n\nThe campaign is a bit short but given teh amount of explosions, battles, cinematic cut scenes is well worth it, but only if you manage to buy it elsewhere on sale.\n\nGot this for 9$ onsale on ♥♥♥.

Another thing about it is that it has its own vision of how they did Survival, because honestly, I like how they have that level system for Spec Ops, where you can gain streaks like knife-streaks, or kill-streaks and stuff, and also where you go to the boxes and pick out your equipment.  I like Black Ops 2 just because of the zombies.  And also I have two firends that have BO2 and MW3 for more then a year, and they say that they are both fun in PvP, but BO2 can get boring after a while, while in MW3, it will take you much longer to get bored. :D","October 2, 2014","true","209.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The multiplayer is very well balanced. Most of the maps are very well designed, the guns have been balanced very well to the point that it now is based on the players skill with the weapon not his spraying bullets. Sure you can spray bullets but good luck on ammo if that is all you do. Gun damage has been well balanced, just about all the hackers have at one point or another been vac banned and therefore are no longer active playing. I know this to be true as i checked some steam accounts and found them to be banned along with the fact that there was no more activity in the game. The game has been out for a long time but has many many players still. It is second place in players in the COD franchise.\n\nSingle Player\n\nStory is very good continuing in the MW series of the story. I would have to say that my favorite storyline in the MW series was COD 4: Modern Warfare. But the story in this installment is still very good.\n\nI have over 800 hours in this game and i still play it. It is fun and if you have not purchased it you are really missing out :-)","August 29, 2014","true","85.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

Standard patriotism, standard talks, standard everywhere you look. And it's too frickin' easy...\n\nMultiplayer:\nWell... let's just say: campers, and dual wielding MP7?

It was on discount (now Iknow why). I usually start playing in multiplayer mode after I finished the campaign, so my article is mostly about the multiplayer experience. Let's see the Pros:\n-Call of Duty game\n-Lots of weapons\n-Usual Call of Duty graphics\n-good Single player campaign story (at last they've finished it!)\n\nAnd now let's see the Cons:\n-the worst Call of Duty Multiplayer game I've ever played (played almost all the episodes)\n-You will be angry even before the match starts\n-Lot of connection problems (If you've played even 10 minutes with it, you understand what I'm saying)\n-Annoying Kill Streak rewards\n-Lots of campers and kids who don't even know what this game is about\n-lots of people who can't play and start cheating, ruining all the game and fun of others.\n-at least 10 game modes (but 99% of MW3 players use the standard TDM...)\n-If you don't have at least a 1 Gbps Internet connection, don't even try it!\n-Lot of DLC-s which would be essential if you want to play (these costs about 3 times the price of the game)\n\nI think that's all I can say about it. I spent many hours trying to find what's good in this game, but in the end, I always quit with the anger and the dissapointment with the question in my mind: Why the hell did i just buy this? (the answer is: franchise advertising). People nowadays (unfortunately me too) only looks at a cover, or advertising, and if the name is familiar, we go and buy it.
