The goal is to get into a big blue sharp looking swirly thing (I though it was killing me when I got into it the first couple of times. turns out it's the level end portal)\n\nThere are only five things that you can do.\n1. Run around (or away from ghost / scythe / Death things)\n2. find collectables (gold coin things)\n3. Commit suicide to provide light\n4. die on obsticles and provide light\n5. get into the portal (swirlly blue thing)\n\nThe only real irk that I have is in the controls... there is no delay between death and respawn, which means that if you die with your finger on the down key, you instantly respawn and are moving down, potentially to straight into a death-thing. It would be nice if there was some minor / tiny delay so that you had time to register that you'd died, and could get your finger off the trigger.\n\nI haven't completed the game, so there may be more ways to die than those mentioned here.\n\nSo, yes / no?\num it's a kind - of Zen type game, at least the early stages have been, with unlimited lives, and every death making the next run easier. Know what you're getting into, and you'll be fine.","March 8, 2015","true","0.4"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","7"

The only source of light is you ... or rather your dead body. That's right, you have to kill yourself if you want to light your path. In each level (in "classic" mode) you'll have to find a blue portal to progress to the next level.\nIn the higher levels you will also encounter traps and the "reaper".\nOptionally, you can try to find collectibles in the levels.\nThe game has its own achievement system, but the dev said (months ago, see the game's Steam discussion page) he'll consider to implement Steam achievements.\n\nBeside the "classic" mode, the game also offers the following game modes:\no Endless: Find 20 medals in a dark forest\no Heart: Not really a game mode, this takes you to the dev's website to a free game called "Sometimes You Lose Heart".\no Trust Fall: An endless falling animation. You can't kill yourself, but on yourway to the bottom you'll encounter traps.\no Chips: You're Pac-Man! ... in a dark maze.\n\nYou can basically see screenshots of each game mode on the Steam store page (except for "Heart", for obvious reasons).\n\nNow here are my personal pros and cons:\n+ Nice background music\n+ Good for casual game play\n+ Nice idea and concept\n+ Good character handling\n+ Stats and achievement pages\n\n- Can get boring fast\n- No online leader board\n- No options. You can't change the resolution or play in fullscreen.\n\nDisclaimer: Got a free copy of the game from orlygift.com","October 15, 2015","true","4.3"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

Your little alien dude runs around or away from the reaper while avoiding spinning squares/obstacles. He also needs to die often to provide light, either by self exploding( provided by you), by dying on obstacles, or the reaper. Once you reach a swirly blue portal, go in and on to the next level.

The difference is that the darkness in Sometimes can only be expelled by your character committing suicide and thereby brightening up a small area of the level. This goes on until you find the exit. Later levels include moving 'traps' and the Grim Reaper, who follows you around the level, but there just wasn't enough in it to hold my interest.\n\nOther game modes offer a bit more variation, but ultimately not enough to make the game worthy of play for more than an hour or so. I've played each of the different game types a few times, got annoyed at the game not always saving in-game achievements (there are no Steam achievements), and discovered that all in all it's just a bit boring.\n\nIt's certainly not a bad game. It's just not really anything special.","May 13, 2015","false","0.9"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","1"

The gameplay is pretty basic; you move with WASD and suicide with spacebar.\nWhy suicide, you ask? The map is always dark, you being the only light source. So, when you suicide, your corpse/soul becomes another light source, making you able to see more of it.\nThere are 5 game modes;\nClassic: Constantly suicide to comprehend obstacles and reach the checkpoint.\nEndless: Suicide to see/gather medals.\nTrust fall: Free fall while evading obstacles.\nChips: "Dark pacman mode". Collect chips while evading ghosts.\n...And heart mode, which I can't acess because it opens a Web Browser page that won't load.\n\nSo, would you recommend Sometimes? Usually I would say no, but considering the price tag and the nice little classical BGM, yes.\nThe suicide sound effect is irritating though.\n","October 31, 2015","true","3.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

There are 4-5 simple game( mode?)s wrapped in one here, and they all seem competently put together even if the graphics are nothing special.  Interesting idea for a mechanic, though it isn't polished enough to be fulfilling to play.  Overall, this game is more like an artist's sketchbook, than a finished piece -- probably not worth selling or buying, but very valuable practice for the author.  They should have waited, and put their next, possibly more cohesive, project up instead.\n\nSummary of game modes:\n\n* "Classic" : Top down, everything is pitch black, press space to start level over, leaving behind a ghostly light source where you were standing.  Find the maze exit, avoiding buzz saws.  Many levels.\n* "Endless" : Top down, pitch black, search a forest for collectibles, light it with ghosts.\n* "Heart" : Opens up a browser, to a page you can download a platformer from.  I did not download and install it.  It seems like maybe that sort of thing should be included in the actual executable steam installs..?  I may go download that (appears free?) game instead and check it out, at a future date.\n* "Trust Fall" : Fall through blackness, dodge buzzsaws, go for longest fall.\n* "Chips" : Pick up collectibles in a Pacman maze.","August 31, 2015","false","0.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

A game which ask only 1 euro or 1 dollar, depends on where you live and your currency, but what I am trying to say is, that this game, doesn't look at all bad. Could it use updated graphics ? yes, but these are enough to enjoy the game. 6/10\n\nMusic - Now here in my opinion is the strongest part of this game, the music that I have heard up to this moment, is only classical music, and mostly from a piano. Don't get me wrong, I do confess, I am a sucker for the old-timey stuff. The only part which I didn't like is that I didn't find an option to reduce sound overall. Even if you do reduce the sound from the windows volume mixer, the sound that you make when you die, stays at the same volume, which really didn't help the mood. At one moment you are listening to calming piano music and at the next when you die, you hear a blasting sound of *SHTRK*. 7/10\n\nCinematics and Story - None\n\nContent - Like I already said, this game is made out of a combination of a few games, while only having one game mode, which it didn't copy. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it does include it's own spin, to not look just a plain copy and paste. It has 5 modes, which one takes you to your browser, 2 of them are copyed, one is pac-man clone and the other a game where you fall down endlessly while trying to avoid obstacles (for short: The let me try one more time type), and 2 modes which are unique. One last thing to add, is that the modes get tougher the more and more you progress through them. 6/10\n\nControls - Everything is fine here, the normal movement keys which are used in almost all games, a few other keys used is specific modes. The only problem I have here was with the pac-man game mode, where when you try to take a turn to enter a tight corridor, is that you get stuch hugging the wall, without really any time to correct your movement, you are dead since the ghosts catch up to you. 6/10\n\nGameplay - Responsive, the game is really well paced, throught any game you might try and when you get tired or had enough of dying, you still have other modes to try out. 7/10\n\nA little game, which ask really almost nothing, but gives you a lot. Most games around this price range, rarely have that much to offer, but this one is an exception. If you do decide to give this a game try, I can assure you, that you won't regret it (as cheesy as it may sound)\n\nFinal Score: 6.4/10","January 28","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game that I assume is the main game, is pointless and not challenging.  Everything is dark, you die to light up the area.  There are no complex mechanics, no time limits, no penalties.  Overall the game just feels like a bunch of quick made flash games that were put together into a compilation and it just seems like they lack purpose.","May 17, 2015","false","0.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

I played all the modes before writing this, but it is pretty much a first imprssions review.\n\nThis looked like a very interesting concept, and overall it meets my expectations.\nSimple gameplay, good as a timewaster. I would recommend it, but It doesn't quite deserve 10/10.\n\nI like the fact that there are cards for it. I don't like the fact that there are in game achievements but not Steam achievements. Not that either strictly mean anything, and I'm not exactly an achievement junkie anyway.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any sort of way to rebind keys, which seems like a small oversight to me. Not that there's anything wrong with WASD, but I have to either play left handed or awkwardly.\n\nLastly, I don't like the menu setup. "Hearts" sends you to a webpage, opening something other than the game. While I don't strictly have a problem with that in and of itself, I don't like that it splits up the actual gameplay choices.\n\nBut what I DO like is the different gameplay choices. They're all different enough that it doesn't get monotonous, which is nice. If you get bored of one, there are other options. If you're in the mood for a specific one, you know what to pick. It could do with some text on mouseover that explains what the mode is, possibly.\n\nOverall, pleased with the game. Would recommend it, but as it is, I'd probably give it around 7.5/10.","March 8, 2015","true","0.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","2"

It seems particularly poigniant right now.  The title made me think that this would be some small, clever game.  Instead, I got a game which plays like it was made in a 1000 or maybe 2000 level coding class of some kind.  The kind of game where you've been dictated that you need x, y, and z elements, but which no one in the class actually bothers to make a good and polished game out of.  This should be ad supported at best, and honestly, if I were the creator, I'd trash it and go back to the drawing board.","April 20","false","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's a top down, puzzle/strategy game. In the beginning there is no light, but when you die your soul give off light to show the way. By repeated suicide you will eventually find the exit portal to the next level. As youprogress you will encounter traps and the grim reaper that will kill you. Its fun, creative and cute, but if your'e prone to rage this game ain't for you. Another thing I would change is a volume bar. It's very late and the crunching noise caused by your death has startled me multiple times. Otherwise; I you like puzzles, traps, and adorable characters (even after they die) that you would love this game.","October 16, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
