If you love humorous games at all, I recommend this.  If you love games with charm, I recommend this game.  If you love talking birds, I recommend this.  If you'd love for me to stop saying "if you love", then go buy this game.  I'll stop.  You'll see.  Go on and try it, I'll wait.  Did you buy it yet?  Maybe if I use the proper scented candle on you, you won't be able to resist.  How about if I offer you some Crabgrass Juice?\n\nSeriously, this is a fun, well-made point and click adventure, without the overly obscure solutions that some games have.  There are a couple of tricky achievements that can be missed, but if you save every so often, you can go back and get them later.  The rest of them are pretty straight-forward.\n\nAnd that brings me to the ONE negative, and that's only for collectors of Perfect Games - at the moment, the final achievement is broken!  You simply can't get it at this time.  That's a bit of a bummer when you've gotten all the others.  But if you want a game that will put a smile on your face (or make you giggle like a silly person), then buy this game anyway.  ACT NOW!

The game's story/setting is charming/quirky and I enjoyed it a lot more than I was expecting. There are quite a few funny moments in the game as well.  The story might not appeal to everyone but I enjoyed it quite a bit.\n\nThe puzzles are pretty clever and well designed. Unlike some point and click adventure games the puzzles aren't obtuse where you have to guess your ways to the correct answer. The game is just really well made.\n\nI really only had two complaints with Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet. First the game is kind of on the shorter side. The game lasts around five to six hours. Since I was really enjoying the game I wish it was a little longer. The other problem is that for the most part I found the game to be kind of easy. You probably aren't going to be really challenged by the game.\n\nAlthough not totally necessary, I would recommend playing the original game first. You won't be lost if you don't play the first game but the game does sometimes address things that happen in the first game so you might be slightly confused a couple times in the game. The original game can be found online for free.\n\nIf you like point and click adventure games I think you will enjoy Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet.\n\nNote: I received a review copy from the developer but received no other compensation for this review.\n\nRead My Full Review[www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","March 22","true","6.0"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

I loved the background art, but was skeptical on how well the new character designs were going to work. Playing the game, the character designs did really grow on me, so I'd say don't write it off if you have the same initial issue. The puzzles are typical for a point-and-click adventure, with nothing too challenging. Really, this game is about its great sense of humor. If you like your games to be a bit clever and adorable, this one is on point. It certainly is one of the punnier games I've played.\n\nAlso, Tom Baker as Sebastian is too charming.

Its a really fun game with lots of humour and a good story. The voice acting is really well done throughout and the hand drawn graphics suit the game and fit well with the story. Right clicking on all the clickable items results in some very funny descriptions. I would have liked the game to be longer, its a bit short and could be completed in about 6 hours if you don't fully explore all the areas.

In this game, we're introduced to our heroine Nelly Cootalot in a tutorial set aboard the mailship Undeliverable. Here you'll learn how to interact with other characters, to examine, pick up and use items, and how to combine them in your inventory. This is also where you learn of the villanous Baron Widebeard's evil plans, which involves a fleet of hypnotised birds.\n\nAs a bird-lover and defender of adorable creatures, Nelly wants none of that, and sets off in pursuit of Widebeard to his last known location. In order to progress from there, you must figure out the Baron's next destination by correctly applying information from a log book to a wall chart of ship departures—a puzzle that is one of my favorites in the game. You also have to gain permission to leave the docks by helping the miserable Admiral Woebegone by solving a classic "three trials" style branching puzzle.\n\nYour next leg of the journey takes you to the main area of the game, which is a large area of three connected islands. Among other things, it has two main streets, several stores, food and drink establishments and a few public service buildings. In short, most of what you'd expect of an actual town, and it reminds me of memorable areas of the classics, such as Rubacava and the towns of the Tri-Island Area. Luckily, you can double-click on exits to teleport, and there's also a map you can use for fast-travel.\n\nThis is also the most diverse area in the puzzle department, and it is where you'll spend most of your time with the game. A puzzle revolving around a pirate-ified version of the classic board game Operation offered the biggest challenge to me, but since there are several other puzzles to tackle, I never felt completely stuck. If you do though, you can always get your bird companion Sebastian to give you a recap of your current objectives, without running the risk of spoiling anything.\n\nA location placed inside the subconsious of a shaman monkey is also worth mentioning, but unfortunately it was all over rather quickly. There's also one large Viking inspired area left after that, but I don't want to spoil more than I already have.\n\nThe game features high-quality voice acting from a large cast of talented British actors, including Tom Baker of Doctor Who and Little Britain. It is also of the funnier games I have played, which should come as no surprise if you played the previous game or witnessed the Kickstarter pitch video or any of the YouTube announcements leading up to the release.\n\nAs a Kickstarter backer, I have participated in the beta since January, and I've been impressed by the developers, who have been very responsive in fixing all of the tricky Linux issues that cropped during the beta, and made me feel like a first-class customer. They have also been exceptionally friendly througout what must have been a long and stressful crunch.\n\nMy first playthrough of the beta took me 5–6 hours, according to my notes, but I've seen estimates of much longer play times, and it's of course highly dependent on your previous experience with the genre. A few of the puzzles felt a bit underwhelming, including a certain barrel puzzle and the finale. Other than that though, the game feels solid throughout, and I think it's a good all-rounder that will appeal to most players.\n\nNOTE: This review was originally posted on GamingOnLinux[www.gamingonlinux.com]","March 23","true","0.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Starting out, and not knowing about the history of Nelly Cootalot, I was skeptical. Although there were some hickups, and a few rough edges(Which I'm sure were pre-release, known issues), I really enjoyed my experience with the game, and was very excited to keep going. This game has a wide demographic in mind, and although I and a big fan of point and click games, I found the challange to be perfect, if a little easy at times. The puzzles are fair and some larger ones require actual problem solving, like the candle puzzle. The humor in the writing is alright. Although some jokes didn't stick, I didn't much mind. The voice acting was great and really added to my experience.\n\nIn short, if you like light hearted point and click adventures, or haven't played a Point and Click in a while, Nelly Cootalot and the Fowl Fleet is a great addition to your library.

She saved the Spoonbeaks once upon a time but now she’s a lowly mail clerk on a mail ship. Her ol’ ghost pirate pal, Bloodbeard, shows up to let her know that her great enemy Widebeard is up to his old tricks again. This time he’s manipulating the Spoonbeaks and various other beards and using them to do his bidding. Now Nelly must find Widebeard and stop him before he releases his Fowl Fleet!\n\nVisuals\nNelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet is the sequel to an Adventure Game Studio title called Nelly Cootalot: Spoonbeaks Ahoy! While that game featured a hand drawn 2D style of gameplay. The Fowl Fleet is beautifully rendered in vibrant 3D visuals. The animations for the various characters and actions are simple but sweet. Don’t expect too much wacky movement outside of a few cut scenes and you should be golden.\n\nThe world of Nelly Cootalot likes to keep it simple, but there are still plenty of kicks to get out of the characters movements. One particularly humorous example is after Nelly helps a bird move to a new home, and he thanks her by giving her a hat full of his poop before sliding away into his new nest. It’s simple and sweet and adds a different sort of hilarity to the world.\n\nStory\nNelly Cootalot is a comedic adventure title and it never stops reminding us. Nelly is gung-ho but completely dimwitted at the same time. She’s like a stupider version of Drax from Guardians of the Galaxy. She takes most anything people tell her literally, so she’ll end up asking ridiculous questions or won’t fully understand basic innuendo.\n\nLuckily, a wide variety of the people she meets are quick to crack a few jokes or two. One of my favorite characters in the game is named, “Gusty Nethers.” Yeah… that’s right… Gusty Nethers. He also has a few other ridiculous names he starts to call himself over the course the game. Gusty is just one of many characters that don’t take themselves too seriously. It makes for some wonderful back and forth banter between Nelly and the various characters.\n\nSound\nThere are some downsides and most of it comes in the form of the voice acting. It’s not to say that the voice acting is bad, in fact a lot of it is great. It’s that the jokes fall flat because the timing or the emotion isn’t particularly perfect. Sometimes Nelly or another character will tell a joke and there is no oomph to it whatsoever. Other times there will be a witty back and forth and the timing of a joke is just not enough to evoke laughter. It’s the moments like these that are a bit of a drawback to The Fowl Fleet, because it’s filled with hit and miss jokes.\n\nGameplay\nWhen it comes to the mechanics of the title. The team sought to make a game that isn’t just ham-fisted with combining items and clicking things. There are quite a few thoughtful puzzles in the game that think outside the box. Lots of the brainteasers rely on some well thought out and even nostalgic design choices. The enigma of it all functions by figuring out elements of a puzzle and piecing it altogether to create one cohesive part.\n\nA sample of this is one of the first real puzzles, where Nelly has to figure out the route of a fleet of ships by studying a log. Using different days as a reference you have to piece together the name and location of a ship she has to board. There are a variation of moments like these that shirk the usual “Click on random things” design of most adventure titles. Nelly Cootalot gives me a Professor Layton vibe as it consistently gives us amusing and well-thought out puzzles to enjoy.\n\nNelly Cootalot may not be a particularly hard game, but how many Adventure games truly are? Most of them are difficult because you didn’t click the right objects, or you missed some dialogue that you can’t see again. Nelly Cootalot never leaves you lingering for too long on one of the many riddles. If you interact with the characters and observe the items, you’ll zip through the game without being tied down by boring pixel clicking.\n\nI appreciate this, because I do enjoy the experience and the story of adventure games more than being stranded on Puzzle Island. I like to be challenged but not to the point where I’m stuck in one specific area for three hours because of something I didn’t notice. Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet is middle of the road in difficulty and I’m perfectly fine with that.\n\nIssues\nI have some early build concerns that hopefully will be addressed in the retail version. The first area of the game is ripe with UI and scrolling problems. The item slot would occasionally stay on-screen which impeded my ability to interact with anything else. Also, there were times when the screen would stop scrolling and I couldn’t walk to an area I needed to visit.  This game doesn’t realize when you’re using dual-monitors and uses the secondary screen instead. I had to switch to single-screen settings if I wanted to record video of the game.\n\nConclusion\nNelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet started off as something I would have dismissed because it was trying too hard to be funny. It’s not until I ran into the first real puzzle before I said, “Hey, this is actually different for an adventure game.” Suddenly, I was hankering for the next new puzzle and engaged in solving any riddle that came my way.\n\nI began to appreciate the simplistic animations and suddenly fell in love with the world of Nelly Cootalot. If you’re looking for an entertaining and different Adventure title, Nelly Cootalot might be the game with just enough charm to draw you in. Nelly is no Guybrush Threepwood, but she is certainly in a position to take over where he left off.","March 22","true","9.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The animation and art are wonderful and the voice acting was some of truly best I've ever heard. Having backed its Kickstarter ages ago, I was very well pleased with the money spent and I would have no qualms about backing them again.\n\nIt's only drawback for me is that it's rather short. I finished it in about 5.5 hours, and that's looking at every single thing.\n\nI would certainly recommend it, though. It's puzzles are well plotted and are much more logical than a lot of adventure games of old, but on the easy side for anyone who's played many adventure games. I've been playing them for over 20 years and had very little trouble with any of them.\n\nThere were a couple of bugs that I noticed. The cursor doesn't always change once you take it off of an item and hover over a different one (for example, you look at Crow's Nest and then Roof, but the cursor will still say Crow's Nest, even though it gives you information on Roof if you click on it). The other bug is when Nelly is supposed to be walking up a hill behind a building. It looks as though she's walking up the front of the building instead.\n\nThe only other thing I would say is that if you want to have a go at getting all of the achievements, they aren't all working yet. The final one (the Timewaster, the one for having achieved all the others) doesn't show up, despite having all the other 19. I had enough pleasure in playing the game, though, that I will go back and play it again once that's fixed.\n\n","March 26","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Let’s break down my impressions, from least important to the most:\n\nGraphics: I kinda miss the original hand-drawn look. It had a unique charm to it that the smoother and less unique 3d models lack.\n\nVoicework: Quite good all around. Except from some British TV guy – apparently everyone were so excited to have him on that they forgot to check whether his voice fits the character.\n\nControls: Remarkably bad, by adventure game standards. Everything feels a bit sluggish and slow to react to commands. Whenever you try to click two items in quick succession (quick = within a second or two) the game is sure to get confused and randomly misapply your clicks.\n\nPuzzle quality: Generally decent – moderately challenging at times, but logical and sensible. You never have to resort to random item combinations, your inventory is emptied of formerly useful items in regular intervals, and the big puzzle sets require just the right amount of thought. I got stuck on two separate occasions – one is a bit of accidental misinformation the developer promised to remove, while the other was a random piece of the puzzle stuck in a cluttered screen where it had no reason to be.\nHOWEVER. There are mini-games scattered at regular intervals, and they are terrible at conveying their control schemes and victory conditions.\n\nWriting quality: Maintains the quirky charm of the original, has a few laugh out loud moments every so often (helped by the voice work and decent comic timing). However, every so often you’ll get a random meme shoved in, not at all meshing with the overall writing style. The game has an “arrow to the knee” joke. In 2016(!)\nAlso, I think the ending and the airship section were severely cut during the production stage, and it SHOWS. Just a bit of a mess from the writing perspective.\n\nOverall: 7/10. Cute and charming, if not a particularly innovative. It’s probably a bit too late to actually fix the ending into something coherent, but improving the controls, mini-game instructions and dumping the memes would bump the rating up to 8/10.","March 29","true","13.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

However, it breezes along with such warm-hearted charm, boundless likability, and its none-more-British sense of humour that it's hard to criticise. It's populated with a cast of great characters, with the eponymous Nelly as the pirate heroine out to save all bird-kind from the schemes of her nemesis, Baron Widebeard. The puzzles are fair, logical, and satisfying to solve; you'll rarely spend time trying random inventory items with everything in sight and are unlikely to be forced to consult a walkthrough. Don't forget to consult your fowl companion, Sebastian, for some of the games funniest lines and hints if you lose track of what you're doing.\n\nThis game is an easy recommendation for fans of pirate adventures of yesteryear (you know the ones...) and point-and-click games in general. You'll spend your entire playthrough with a big smile on your face or your money back (maybe).","April 29","true","5.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/salvatos/recommended/317320/","salvatos","Salvatos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/salvatos/","39 products in account","Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet is a fairly straightforward game that does not make you stop and think too long about each puzzle or force you to combine items aimlessly to figure out what to do next. Your goals are simple, and the way to accomplish them is often hinted at with just an ounce of subtlety by dialogue or object descriptions. The first minigame was the only one I didn't really grasp, and I still made it on my first try with a lucky guess. The others could have used some explanation at least for using their interfaces like Daedalic did for the Deponia series, but trial and error doesn't punish you for failure, so you can just figure it out on your own.\n\nThe main selling point of the game would be its humor, which had me not only smile at the numerous puns but genuinely laugh out loud at some of the main character's quips. Nelly herself is another high point of the game with her endearing mix of lawlessness and cluelessness. Her remarks make you want to look at every object twice to make sure you hear all the clever little things she has to say about them.\n\nOverall the game is a bit on the short side (a little over 5 hours for me), but a fun and relaxing interactive adventure throughout. Likely an excellent choice to introduce your kids to the genre!","March 25","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thekelvingreen/recommended/317320/","thekelvingreen","thekelvingreen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thekelvingreen/","20 products in account","First things first, I should mention that one of my friends was involved in the production of this game -- and voices a pompous sea bird -- and I've spent an afternoon playing Bomberman with both the creator of the game and Nelly Cootalot herself, or at least her inspiration and voice actor.\n\nNelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet is a comedic point and click adventure game about pirates. If you are now thinking "Gosh, that's a bit like deciding to be a sprinter and challenging Usain Bolt to a race your first time out" then that's a bit weird that we both thought of that, but you'd be correct. The shadow of Monkey Island looms large over this game -- now I'm imagining a Lovecraft pastiche; The Shadow Over Monkey Island -- but not only does the script acknowledge the influence, Nelly Cootalot is strong enough to stand up to and apart from its illustrious predecessor.\n\nThe writing for the most part is strong, and the characters' personalties come across well, helped in no small part by good voice acting throughout. Nelly herself is a charming protagonist; everyone seems to like her, and her cheerful approach to adventure is infectious. The main villains are a bit sketchy, and not in the appropriate sense of the word; I think they return from the original game in the series, but as I've not played that, their motivations and personalities seem a bit vague in this instalment. A new villain introduced in the middle section of the game comes across far better, although again his motivations and connection to the main plot are somewhat unclear. Still, it's Nelly and her friends who are most important and they are well-written and acted; aside from Nelly herself, I was most impressed by her sidekick Sebastian, voiced by Tom "Warhammer 40,000: Fire Warrior" Baker. To be honest, I was expecting someone of Sir Tom's prestige to sleepwalk through his role but he brings a lot of personality to Sebastian, even though he has one of those voices that means you can never quite forget that there's an actor behind the character.\n\nThe game is funny, and there's a varied approach to the jokes, with plenty of references to films and games, a bit of witty wordplay, a dash of satire here and there, and at least one bit of smutty innuendo, although that last one doesn't land as well as it could have due to some clumsy back-pedalling. Some comments and reviews have claimed that the game is for children -- perhaps because of the art style -- but the latter joke suggests not, and some of the references are going to go right over the heads of most kids, unless they are showing Jack Nicholson films in primary schools these days.\n\nThe game looks good too. The trailers did look a bit ropey, with a flat animation style reminiscent of Flash or a cheap CBeebies programme, but the game itself looks much better. The character models look to be cel-shaded and that gives them a bit more weight, and they are for the most part well-animated; it is a bit of a shame that they don't tend to do anything when Nelly isn't interacting with them, but one has to remember that this isn't a multi-million pound game with a hundred-strong creative team behind it. That said, it's a pleasant surprise when you spot a character making a small movement or gesture that must have added time to the production schedule and is irrelevant to wider game, but helps to bring the character to life. It shows a dedication and craftsmanship that you don't often see in the aforementioned larger productions.\n\nI did encounter a couple of graphical glitches; during one part of the Guttering Howls section Nelly walks in front of and through something she should be behind, and in the penultimate chapter the inventory panel goes a bit wonky, but is still usable. I also had a bit of trouble with the game's interface being slow to register what was under the pointer, although the mechanics worked as expected, so it wasn't a major issue. I played the game on Linux Mint 17.3 and I don't know if these glitches are in every port.\n\nHeh, "port". Like sailors. Heh.\n\nNelly Cootalot's puzzles are varied and often require different approaches and techniques to solve; even when they are of the give-item-A-to-person-B sort, they are at least presented in novel ways so the game never gets dull. In terms of difficulty, the puzzles are if not simple, then logical, so you are never hunting for rogue pixels or throwing every item at every character, hoping for the best.\n\nThat said if there is a flaw in Nelly Cootalot -- and to be fair, it is the only thing I would consider a proper flaw -- it's the wider game and story logic surrounding the puzzles. On a few occasions I worked out the solution to a problem, and had all the correct items in my inventory ready to go, but I couldn't apply said solution because I hadn't gone to talk to someone -- often in another location -- who was supposed to give me the idea I'd already had. This led to frustration and -- in one case near the end of the game -- a suspicion that there was a game-breaking bug. On the plus side, Sebastian is able to give hints about what to do next, and in at least one case this helped resolve the impasse, although in the latter instance I did end up roaming around clicking on everything and everyone until I spoke to the right person.\n\nCreator Alasdair Beckett-King is a jolly nice fellow -- and is not bad at Bomberman -- but it turns out he's quite good at making computer games too. I had great fun playing Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet and although it is short -- it can be completed in about five hours or so, although getting the Steam achievements will take longer -- I think it is worth the £12 I paid for it. There are rough edges, and places where I feel Alasdair and his team could have done a tiny bit more, but what's here is good, and I hope the game is enough of a success that we see more from him.\n\nIf you like point and click adventure games, give this a try because you'll probably ike it. If you don't, give it a try anyway, as it's charming and funny and may change your mind.","March 28","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
