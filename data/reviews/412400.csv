It's a moon. But I'm not paying £1.99 blind to get to Mars right away so the Moon it is.\nI crash land. Command tries to panic me over the radio regarding my dwindling oxygen levels and tells me to head for one of five markers. My choice. The situation looks... well, promising is a strong word but I'm not offended by the experience. Not yet.\nNearly fifteen minutes later, after CRAWLING over the surface of the Moon in what feels like excruciating real time while being battered every five feet by random space debris, my marker is within sight at the centre of a crater. I move towards it. As I attempt to enter the crater, an invisible barrier stops me. I become upset. I try to move around the perimeter of the forcefield. GASP responds by freezing me in place and continuing to batter me with space rocks. I leave before I can give it the satisfaction of killing me.\nYou can recreate this fun experience at home by attempting to run into a wall while a friend or family member throws rubble at the back of your head or you can check out my tragic journey below. Whatever you choose, please... don't let it be GASP's install button.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyWdC88urTA\n","November 12, 2015","false","0.5"," 847 of 886 people (96%) found this review helpful 645 people found this review funny","96","847","886","645","22"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phr05t/recommended/412400/","phr05t","bernt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phr05t/","62 products in account","GASP.\n\nLong winded / semi-comprehensive review.\n\nThe game is about 900 mb, give or take, and it didn't take long to install. Once you open the game, you're met with display options, but the graphics aren't impressive even on the highest setting. Starting this game in windowed mode may cause some problems. On the HUD, you're likely to receive some error messages like 'SetNextWeapon is not in VP Input Manager's buttons. You must add it for this button to work.' It obscures your (admittedly worthless) GPS module in the bottom lefthand corner. Poor coding, but jokes on you, there are no weapons.\n\nThe menu music is exactly the same as the music in game. A 20 second dark ambience loop that is poorly looped because it clips at its origin. Also, whichever menu option you select will immediately reset the loop.\n\nNow once you hit the play button, there's no backing out of this menu. You must choose Moon, or if you were compelled beyond belief with high expectations into purchasing it, Mars.\n\n\nAlright, let's get rolling. First off, a really ominous (read: not really) text-based message pops up before you begin your journey, telling you that this game is not designed to hold your hand, and that once you die, you die. However, this is misleading as you can't actually die. More on that later.\n\nOn the Comms you hear an androgenyous voice, clearly not at all concerned for your safetly, tells you in a plaintive tone that you've crashed. I should note that the crash is IMPLIED, you don't actually see the crash, as there's no cinematic cutscene or anything. This supposed crashsite is just a poorly moddled white conical shape, tilted to its side on a rock because, you know, it crashed. No damage --  nothing. How exquisite.\n\nThe androgynous voice tells you that your oxygen levels are limited and because basically your visor got f*cked up in the crash, and it actually shows you 5 different signals to follow instead of one leading you back to the LZ. It's up to you to run in one direction for an hour to find out which one is the real LZ! He/she offers some coy words of advice, telling you that you should choose wisely and hope for the best, because he/she THINKS the oxygen won't hold out long after he/she told you the oxygen levels are limited in the first place. Wow, as an astronaut I never, ever, in a million light years never would have rationally came to that conclusion. Thanks for all the help.\n\nControls are pretty straightforward. WASD to move, Spacebar to jump, and RMB to zoom in. Funnily enough, you can either tap the spacebar for a quick jump and fall, or hold down Spacebar to jump to new heights, and glide down until you release the spacebar, at which point you fall flat downward in place. Yep, this is typically how real life moon physics work, as I understand it.\n\nWhoa sh*t! What was that? Giant bouncy balls that are all the same shape falling from the sky? Nobody briefed me on this? Oh they're supposed to be meteor showers that are hellbent on killing the player astronaut at all costs. Just like the developers, we all know the Moon is much bigger and has much more gravity than Earth, so of course it's safe to assume that the planet is getting consistently, CONSISTENTLY pelted with showers, no, blankets of meteors. I began to ask myself if this was indeed the much anticipated Chicken Little walking simulator on the moon that I've been hearing so much about?\n\nYou can SEE the meteors spawn in the skybox. On your HUD you get periodic warning text when a meteor is in the vicinity of your player. Each direct hit with a falling meteor reduces your oxygen, yes, your OXYGEN levels by 10% a pop. Oxygen decrements on its own, I didn't bother really counting the time between % points, but I knew I lost a point of O2 because my visor filled with blood. Yes, your f*cking visor gets splattered with blood when you lose an O2 point. Remember the last time you held your breath and blood poured out of your face? Neither do I.\n\nThe first signal I reached was a big disappointment. It was just a radio-like object with a light emitter on the ground. I couldn't actually do anything with it, such as interact or pick it up. So I had to walk for another 20 minutes to try and get to the next point on my HUD while "dodging" these space balls.\n\nOn my journey I went from %100 Oxygen to %Dead oxygen (no, not joking, this is actually how it's presented). Oh, I guess having a non-existent number like Dead for my O2 reading is nothing to be concerned about, because my breathing maintained its course. It was the same loop I've been hearing for the past 45 minutes, and it continued to haunt me. I began to have fantasies about the tell-tale breathing stopping. It just kept breathing, and breathing, and breathing and the more I heard it, the more it bore into my consciousness. Was I experiencing space madness?\n\nAbout 800 meters away from another signal, I encountered an invisible wall. I tried another route and got hit with another wall. Then I tried to go in the opposite direction to the northernmost signal and guess what? I hit another invisible wall. Now if you guessed that correctly, your thought process is probably more cogent than anyone involved in the making of this Press-W simulator.\n\nWalking aimlessly at this point, I must have tripped something because the meteors were disappearing about 200 meters from impact on the ground. I could literally sit back and watch the bouncy ball showers spawn above me and attempt to smash me into the ground.\n\nSo whether or not you run out of Oxygen or get killed by falling rocks, you never actually die in game. The only way you die is to commit suicide IRL while playing this game.There are Steam achievements in this game. However, only about 1% gutted it out to get any of them. If they'd just add an uninstall achievement, 100% of the players would have it and you'd actually feel as if you had accomplished something.","February 25","false","0.9"," 263 of 280 people (94%) found this review helpful 173 people found this review funny","94","263","280","173","8"

A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ walking simulator, and incredibly untentertaining. I also saw rocks fly through the ground, and dissapear infront of my eyes. It also burnt up my ♥♥♥♥ing CPU at the end cutscene. This only shows that the sequel to this game's just going to be horrible. DLC, really? FOR THIS!?\n\nPlease don't release anything anymore, just don't.\nI'm begging of you, take this horrid piece of work off the steam store. I can probably make a better god-forsaken game in RPG maker, even. And I don't know how to use it, either.\n\nHere's why, (I DID NOT WRITE THIS SPECIFIC PART.)\n\nAlso, here's a reminder of what these "Developers" have done.\n\n1) They ban you for negative comments on their forums. I got a permanent ban for pointing out that they had run 5 kickstarters for this game (2 successful). They said it was a false accusation, but you can go to Kickstarter and see it for yourself (although they've changed the names around to make it harder to find).\n\n2) They delete all negative comments on their Greenlight submissions.\n\n3) They have a UnitZ asset pack in the Steam store.\n\n\n(I didn't write the list above.)\n\nNow, the reason why they went F2P with this game, is because they thought that they'd get more money by having a "Free" game, and hope people would buy the DLC.\n\nThe dlc's just a bloody reskin of the game, by the way. Same, horrible graphics and gameplay.\n\nPlease, check the developers out, first. People like this, who constantly shelve out horrible games, need to get booted off of here. Take your horrid, putrid, stupid games off of my community, you fiends. I've been on here for seven years, and not ONCE. NOT ONCE, have I played a game so horribly, mind-bogglingly terribad as this. Atleast temper tantrum had unique gameplay, ATLEAST I COULD SAY IT WAS ORIGINAL FOR THE GAMEPLAY ASPECT AND IDEAS, BY MAKING YOU SMASH FURNITURE.

At the beginning I was bombarded with rocks flying towards my face and injuring me, which was more annoying than fun since they were near impossible to avoid. Later on, though, instead of hitting me they would just disappear before reaching me. After reaching one of the locations marked on the map, I had absolutely no idea what to do with the signal (since there's no way of knowing what to do since they dont "hold your hand") so I just moved on. After walking for about 6 more minutes I hit a giant invisible wall that I couldn't jump over or go around...so I tried to kill myself by touching one of the rocks on the ground (I never knew rocks could kill me by touching them). After my Oxygen reached %1 it immediately went to %Dead...and I was still alive.

You are left with a crowd of people looking at nothing in the hope that something interesting happens.  There you have social experiment of 'GASP'.\n\nGame Play Review:\n\nAstronauts are the best of the best.  Well in this game you are not a member of that group, you probably got to the moon by winning a charity auction.  As you will soon discover you don’t have the Right Stuff.\n\nOptions:\nThe developers spared you from a long tutorial by incorporating the same game mechanics you learned from your first PC game back in the 90's.\nYou can switch between appalling or disappointing graphics in the options but the two cord background music loop is there for your enjoyment for the duration of the game unless you mute your whole system.\n\nGameplay:\nYou find yourself crashed on the moon miles away from your crewmates, leaking oxygen from your spacesuit and pummeled by falling objects; objects that must be from the asteroid remnants from the movie Armageddon due to their alarming frequency.\n*a special note here, if you find yourself on Mars then you bought the DLC and should be excluded from any future Steam purchases.\n\nYour physical attributes preclude you from avoiding any of the falling debris each finding its way into your face; all lacking the mass to disturb the dust on the moon’s surface but are somehow able to send you sprawling.\n\nIn your headset the teenaged cheerleader mission control assigned as your communication officer explains your situation and the urgency to reach the other crew members for your very survival is at stake instilling in you the sense of utter futility and the need to be in an altogether different game and scenario.\nThus your journey begins.\n\nOh but before you can commence your adventure the cheerleader gives the you a Monty Hall scenario by offering you 5 objectives to choose from, 4 lead to zonks and the fifth may be 'the big deal of the day" or your untimely death.  You feel the suspense tingling through you!\n\nYou start your journey and after a short time your mind’s eye pictures the game developers sitting over you as gods laughing at your futile attempt to traverse their landscape in the effort to reach one of the signal locations. First the devGods chuckle as they throw meteors at your face to divert you from the chosen path. If the devGods find that you are truly determined to follow this path they will test your faith for they'll smit you with an invisible wall at just the right angle that you believe you can circumvent the wall and continue advancing to your destination.  When you realize that there is no going around the barrier you decide to retrace your path but the devGods say "Oh neigh neigh" and drop another invisible wall across the return path.  You know the devGods are wetting themselves by now as they prepare for the coop degras having trapped you.  Now they have their fish-in-a-barrel they throw stones at until you are %DEAD but that is not the end for they are devGods and they say that %DEAD is only mostly dead which is not completely dead thus you remain their trapped pray for eternity.\n\nPros:\nShort learning curve for mechanics.\nBouncy castle physics, why should children have all the fun.\n\nCons:\nLong learning curve, you have to complete full playthrough to understand how much you are wasting your time.\nThe devs say it may be an experiment but have no feedback channel.\nThe program stays listed in your library even after you uninstall it.\n\n-END-","March 18","false","0.5"," 73 of 75 people (97%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","97","73","75","40","1"

I have to say, I thought all this negativity was a little overdone.\n\nNonetheless, here is an honest review:\n\nThe cover looks rather amazing, something I would actually expect on a decent game. Hiding behind this decent cover though lies an absolutely steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ which I would only approach with a mask and a long stick to poke it.\n\nThe main gameplay element, is pressing W. No, literally, press W. You have an Oxygen bar (which the 12 year old tells you at the beginning), saying you only have enough to make it to one of the beacons. This is a TOTAL lie because you cant even make it to 4/5 beacons because there is an invisible wall prohibiting you from getting to them, and the fun fact is, it appears the main objective you have to get to is BEHIND one of these walls. After spending 40 minutes within this pile of ♥♥♥♥ to try and make it to each objective. Then, once I finally made it to the one i could get to, there was a blinking electronic device you can't even interact with.\n\nOn top of this, the gameplay element of walking and dodging meteors goes away after about 10 minutes (more than most people put into this). Seriously, I was walking along and getting hit time and time again by meteor after meteor which would actually take away your oxygen everytime you got hit, not even killing you (And I thought this was a survival game?). After 10 minutes, it appears the meteors simply dissapear above you, literally they are coming right at you as that is the only place they actually land only they were simply dissapearing about 10 feet ahead of me, 30 minutes into the game they dissapeared almost as they spawned. So there is the ONLY gameplay mechanic that seemingly kills itself.\n\nSo here is a list of the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\nI glitched the game and made my character (whenever he took a step) do a barrel roll, so by the end of 40 minutes I was simply spinning.\n\nCons:\nSound\n12 Year old commander\nNo Gameplay\nPressing W\nTakes up about 1 gig of Space\nGraphics\nHas DLC\nNot Simulation, or multiplayer (Infact, how the ♥♥♥♥ did it even get multiplayer tag?)\nCant even walk after 40 minutes.","March 5","false","0.8"," 77 of 83 people (93%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","93","77","83","40","4"

They constantly fly at the character, and so you are constantly - non-stop dodging meteors.  Really?  Dodging them every now and them is fun, but not constantly, throughout the ENTIRE MISSION.

What's the point? Why am I here? Why am I leaving the crash site? What do I do? All of this is explained very well, and by very well I mean not at all...\n\nSo what I got out of my brief time playing this, you weeble wobble, prancing around on the Moon and try to avoid being slammed by asteroids and not die. You run into invisible walls and seem to take damage randomly. You have a limited oxygen and there are "unknown signals". What you you do with those unknown signals is beyond me. Walked up to one, didnt know what I was supposed to do, gave up. I got bored and tried to kill myself. Unfortunately, my oxygen levels were still at 48% and I frankly didn't feel like waiting to suffocate. So I tried to let an asteroid hit me, yeah... I struggled to take a hit and I got bored again and left. Speaking of asteroids, yeah, they appear to be made out of bouncy balls. They just bounce and come to a stop eventually. Not exactly an impact I would expect but there you go.\n\nIn a nutshell:\n-boring\n-not pretty\n-clunky\n-music gets old real fast\n-no meaning, nothing to really take away...\n\n\nIf you want to bored yourself to death, give it ago. If you want to simulate what it's like on the moon, stay away.

But you gotta buy the DLC for that\n- No long loading screens or unskippable cut-scenes.\n- Cutting edge effects!\n- Supports some versions of Windows\n- I found 4 bugs in the first 5 minutes of play. That's (not joking) more stable than Space Engineers.\n- No lag\n- Supports stereo\n- State of the art realistic physics engine. Asteroids bump up and down like bouncing-balls and you can push super large objects on the moon or even propel them into space. Sometimes your character glitches through terrain or get's propeled super high into space. Don't worry that's all intended.\n- Zombie-support. After you die you can still walk, jump everything. Just ignore the "you died" message and keep on playing!\n- When playing in windowed mode, you'll see that ugly 'Windows 95' mouse on your screen. So you never lose track of your mouse!\n- Highly intelligent AI (asteroids)\n- No constant food scavenging, unlike most other survival games\n- Steam achievements that are not totally all more or less the same and do not all totally come with the same icon as if it was put together in 2 minutes.\n- Runs at next-gen-technology, 60 FPS!\n\n\nCon's:- No gameplay\n- No adult content\n- No excessive gore\n- "Air Control" was better (Google it).\n- Get's repetitive fast, as in, after 6 seconds of play.\n- No super expensive founders pack to get my name in the credits. Status is everything\n- No killing of innocent people, kids or the disabled\n- Not critically acclaimed.\n- No character customization\n- No co-up\n- I expected ingame funny super-bowl advertisements that I had to click every 10 seconds in order to continue my free play. I'm disappointed.\n- Their storepage misses some good phrases. I mean, even RPG Maker games on Steam use phrases like "stunning graphics" on the storepage while using only the default graphics. But this game did not use any such phrases... Amateurs!\n- Not enough fanboys and hired people from India voting down negative reviews.\n- The game crashes on a regular basis with the message: "The application did not identify itself" and "The crash reporter is unable to submit a report for this crash".","January 19","false","0.2"," 72 of 116 people (62%) found this review helpful 97 people found this review funny","62","72","116","97","0"

This space staregy/simulator is one of the worst games I've ever played. Glitchy and unrealistic. For an action space game where you are supposed to dogde pieces of rock falling from the sky, this game is utterly boring. (yes I'm aware what an asteroid and a meteorite is but these rocks does not resemble asteroids nor meteorites at all!). Also, the impact of the rock is even more unrealistic, the rocks just bounce around a little and then the vanish, not to mention that is one was actually hit by such a piece of rock, it would result in instant death yet in this game you can survive dozens of impacts.\n\n","November 13, 2015","false","0.1"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","16","18","4","0"

Despite this being a survival game, there seemed to be no real way to extend the amoun of oxygen you have, nor does the game explain if there are any importance to the "annomalies" and why they are there.  It honestly blows my mind that the creator has already made DLC for this title and is planning a sequel considering how bad this game seems to be right now.\n\nTL;DR\nGame is very poorly designed and needs A LOT of improvement to be even reminiscent of being fun.

Read the terrible reviews of this game. Saw that it was free and only 900MB and I get download speeds on steam of around 7MB/s. Figured I'd try it anyway, since the only thing I had to lose was time I was otherwise wasting on being bored. Everything everyone is saying about this game is true. The chick that comes over comms in the trailer is the only voice to get to hear through the entire game. And that's all she says before she leaves you on your own. What you hear in the trailer is literally the entire game's dialogue. Now, if you want to make a little simulator about walking across the lunar surface in a space suit to try and link up with lost team members before you run out of oxygen, that's fine. But what is with these friggin' meteors? Every half a second you are being accosted by a new meteor that is headed straight for you by some miracle of science and physics. They are the size of a small car. And then one hits you, yes, you take a direct hit from a meteor the size of a small car, and the results are... underwhelming... You know how when in real life a meteor of even a small size is moving at such a tremendous speed that it's like a little nuke going off on impact, with a big, dramatic boom and shake and smoldering impact crater? None of that happens here. You get hit by one of these meteors and your screen goes red for a few seconds almost like the astronaut you are playing as is just going "Ow... ow... ow...". These meteors impact both you and the ground around you ceaslessly and instead of doing anything cool when they hit the ground, they simply bounce around like rubber balls and make no impact on the lunar surface which is for some reason marred with craters from meteors just like this impacting into it for billions of years, though the frequency with which these meteors are impacting has never been seen in reality since the likes of the violent creation of our solar system eons ago. Seriously, stop with the meteors. They are a silly gimmick that actually subtracts from what barely noticeable subtance this game already has. I actually felt a bit offended to see that they wanted to charge me $2.99 to do the same thing on Mars instead of Luna. Do they really expect anyone to buy that? What's worse, has anyone actually bought it? Seriously, don't mess with this game unless you're just in one of those "Got nothing better to do" situations like I was.","June 3","false","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The compassion I feel when asteroids are coming at me from all directions in space at mach 3. The calming senssation I get from being sniped 2305 meters away every 30 seconds by the International Space Station (which inexplicably decides to orbit the moon and not the Earth).

This game is a real piece of art.\n\nThe game is just very misunderstood, please let me explain.\n\nWhat GASP is really about, is imagination. So many games nowadays actually are fully feautured with many things to do and great graphics leaving little to no room for your own imagination.\n\nThis game is none of that! The game forces you to use your own imagination to make this a great expirience.\n\nIn real your just walking and walking while unexplainable rock after rock fall from the sky on "PLANET" Moon until you're like ♥♥♥♥ it i don't even want to finish this and uninstall.\n\nBut in your mind you have to build your own base from the crash debree and survive hunger and thirst  and alien encounters. Also the young Pamela Anderson in Baywatch outfit will join you and do everything you desire. All offcourse VR HTC Vice supported!\n\n\nGASP is all about to activate your own fantasy and imagination.

You start with about 79% of oxygen in your tank (but no scale how big your tank is) - but basically it lasts a fairly long time ... but in my game, 4 of the 5 'signals' were unreachable, actually out of the games borders... mad :(\n\nThe one unindentified signal I was able to reach, I then couldnt actually interact with.. it seemed to have a force-field bubble round it or something and i could jet-pack ontop of this bubble and look at the item from a few meters up, but I could not pickup/interact with it.\n\nWhen you 'die' from lack of oxygen, the game doesnt seem to end. You are merely labelled "%Dead" - which seems to be a new mathetical metric in its own right - and you can merily run / jump around still exploring.\n\nYou can then start taking rocks straight to the face with no ill affect.\n\nWhen rocks approach the lunar surface, the actual physics involved is highly suspect;\na) the rocks never leave an impact crater\nb) the rocks sometimes dissapear just meters from the lunar surface\nc) very occasionally, the rocks pass straight through the lunar surface\ne) the rocks like bouncing as though they were made from polysterene (like in the cheap 80's films)\nf) I was able to defend myself from a rock-in-the-face by simply standing behind the lunar-landers *LEG* beam... only a 3 inches round this thing.. and about 2ft long.. but it fully deflected a large rock coming from outta-space at quite some speed.\n\nAnyway, needless to say, the number the anomolies this game produces is bizarre (lighting, dust/particles, invisible blockages) - BUT - it is free... and the atmosphere is good :D\n\nLast note: in the background of space you can see the IIS and some other space craft (maybe MIR, or the new chinese one going up some point 'soon(tm)') - but anyway, if this number of rocks was actually hitting the lunar surface, there is NO WAY those stations would stay in orbit!! lol\n\nOverall; play it - its free... if you engage with it and take it seriously, it does quicken your heart and get that adrenalin going a little... nice dust affects above a couple of feet off the surface..\n\n\n\n","May 7","true","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

The asteroids should hit the ground and sink in. It should be a mix of asteroids hitting the ground and rolling and sinking into the moon.\nThe falling asteroids actually become annoying. There is no time to actually enjoy the atmosphere.\n\nWays To Improve:\nCreate an actual story line. It doesn't have to be anything spectacular, just something.\nChill out on the falling rocks.\nMake the game a little longer, have some checkpoints, where you can refull on oxygen, possibly meet up with a hurt character who dies or something.\nJust provide some more substance.","January 14","true","0.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The graphics are amazing for a free game, and the atmosphere is set perfectly. It has serious potential if the devs put more work on it, and that's why I'm not writing it off with a poor review.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where the good ends in this game. There is virtually no gameplay, just running in a straight line toward a waypoint while taking seemingly random damage, only to hit an invisible wall 1,000 meters from it, and being unable to find a path around it. If you're not into giving people the benefit of the doubt, but still want to experience the empty, lonely, coldness of space, play The Swapper.","January 19","true","0.5"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

I may have just logged 23 minutes of this game so far, but I might as well as talk about this...\n\nI'll go ahead and start with an overview. This game is essentially about an astronaut who crashed his ship on the moon (or Mars) and is stranded. With five signals spread all across the surface of the moon (or Mars), and your O2 tank running low, you need to make the long and perilous treck across, and hope you can survive an onslaught of space rocks plummiting to the ground.\n\nWell, where do I begin? There are so many good and bad things about this game. And with a story like that, you would think it would be stellar. An absolute gem. And to some extent, it is! It is a decent time waister, so if you're bored, you can boot this up for a quick go. Not to mention, it is pretty. It captures the near barren landscape of the moon rather well.\nAlso, lets not forget the setup. As I thought about it, it is a scary thought, getting stranded on a lunar body, millions of miles from Earth, with NO way of communicating than one out of five strange signals. It's pretty terrifying.\n\nHowever, there are bugs in this game. LOTS. One that I can see that is pretty game breaking is God's invisible wall, which stops you after a certain point. You get blocked, and you can either return, or simply just return to the space craft and wait for your oxygen to run out.\n\nSpeaking of the oxygen, that is a nice feature. And it's depletion is rather slow, making for enough time to get to your objective. However, once you recah an objective, you gotta figure out what to do. I haven't found a single button on my keyboard that allows for you to interact, so that's pretty bad.\n\nA fun feature is the meteor shower. That's pretty fun. Running across the moon (or Mars) as large meatballs of rock rain down from the sky is pretty fun. That is, if you figure how to run. There isn't a sprint mechanic, and that's understandable, space suit, duh. But, yeah, it's still nice.\n\nPeople have said that they've been getting hit by invisible meteors. Not really, it's just your oxygen going down. I know, seems strange, as it's the smae thing as a damage indicator, but oh well.\n\nSince this is in Early access, I say don't be too harsh on it, but don't be a panzy about what you think. It may (or may not) get better by the time it's fully released. As it stands now, yeah, I like it. Do I recommend it? Yeah, you can try it out, give a run through. It's free, looks decent, and runs pretty decently, even on my PC, so, it's worth a try. Just don't get Mars unless your REALLY want to, it's $3.00.","December 10, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","2","8","2","0"

IT TAKES 100 MINUTES TO DIE but every time i did lose oxygen and when the screen flashed red I noticed a red marker kinda like in Call of Duty when you get shot the red part of the HUD indicates where you got shot from, only you dont get shot in this game later I came up with a theory that none of the 5 strange signals are real because as I said when the red hud flashes under the damage indicator thingy there was something like 2596 m so I assumed that but I didnt follow it Reason ( 1 ) I was already 500 m away from the first marker ( 2 ) Im not gonna spend 25 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes heading there and ( 3 ) Im not gonna waste time on something that may not be real and just be my stupid imagination coming up with random ♥♥♥♥ again, anyway so I keep heading toward this strange beacon thing and once i get there a strange C4 looking thing sits on the ground I try to interact but nothing happens so i try heading right then the game pulls a ♥♥♥♥ you Dragon as it blocks me with an invisible wall reminder still being hit by asteroids, about the asteroids it actally a 1 in a billion that even 1 asteroid can hit you because that amount of asteroids bundled up to shoot you is impossible because each asteroid in an asteroid belt has 50 trillion, trillion cubic metres of space aswell right after i quit the moon i bought the dlc for mars it was like the stomping land all over again. All that mars is its just a color swap of the moon and the skybox is just annoying so in my opinion the moon should be the dlc, jesus christ so after being thoroughly disapointed I left the game uninstalled it and went to bed.","November 19, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"we are not gunna hold your hand"- the game this quto is bad i dont care if they hold my hand or not as long as there not punching my face while stabing me in the chest with a rusty fork while my family watchs in horror. please please dont play this game, honistly if your board go turn on your washer watch it for 40 mins and youll have more fun.","November 19, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You start off crash landed on the moon with a limited amount of supply of oxygen and you have to pick a random beacon on the map.  Then you pray to god the beacon you made it to works and someone comes and saves you before you run out of oxygen.  For some godforsaken reason while you are running for your life to the beacon and running out of o2 there are meteors coming at you in only the direction you are running.  I then noticed at all times there are two spacestations hovering above your head at all time.  The reason for this is the Developers installed a HAL unit in each station.  You being Dave Bowman have jepordized the mission to mine the moon the find the monolith, the HAL units have colluded to kill you and purposfully crash landed you on the moon after hijacking the controls of your escape pod.  When you crash you hit your head hard causing you to have amnesia.  HAL tries to trick you because he knows this and tries to get you to waste your o2 trying to find the beacons.  Each space station is equiped with a gravity cannon and HAL uses this to hurl large moon rocks at you from the far side of the moon.  Once you understand this your true goal in this game is to find the Monolith.  When you find the Monolith then the game really begins when you enter god mode when you Dave Bowman are absorbed by the Monolith.  Lol I can't believe no one got past the first level.

When they do hit it is with enough force to create craters, no roll around like beach balls. I think they are there in a failed attempt to liven up this dull game. The setting should be atmospheric, interesting and realistic. The Earth is too big and no space station will ever be so close to the moon to be this size. Despite these anoyances I persiveared with the game, walking for ages to cover the 3km to my gps target, only to be blocked by an invisible wall 700m away. It seems the only point of playing this game has been disabled by terrable game design.

Total radio silence except for the first few seconds that you also see in the trailer and no clue on what to do, since I obviously couldn't go to any of the things I thought I should be able to get to.\n\nI really want to like this, but it's impossible to enjoy the experience when you can't even do the most simple of things that the game wants you to do, heck, I couldn't even get to the plug for their real game, much less get any interest in actually investing time and/or money in it.\n\nSo, this is very much a NOT RECOMMENDED and if their main game is even remotely like this, I won't recommend anyone trying that out either, much less spend their money on it.\n\nI don't know if there is some kind of random generation of the map and/or signal locations, but in either case, it's clearly not done well enough.\n\nWhat I'm mostly baffled at here, is the fact that the devs apparently are confident enough to release something like this, do they feel no pride in their game? In any case, I hope they can prove me wrong in the future.\n\n*edit*\nI notice reviewers bashing the game for either being a Unity game or having "♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics", this saddens me to a great deal. Unity games can be both beautiful and good, and this is most certainly not one of the worse looking Unity games I've seen. Please stop the nonsensical hate on Unity engine and on graphics that aren't necessarily "uberHD omgpwnzor".

The moon is not this close. Also, since when do astoriods hit the surface of the moon and mars and then FLING of back into space. They BOUNCE off the surface in this game. Also, why is there this many astoroids hitting Mars and the moon, this man astoroids coming towards the moon, one is bound to miss and hit the Earth. Its extremely blury to the point were you can't see and the games graphics look poor. If this is a simulator, then at least make it like one. The lack of knowing what is going on in this game confuses you, you literally hit play and are suddenly on the moon or mars. After crashing, I don't know how. Also, does your character have some gravitational pull greater then the moon or Mars that guides the astoroids toward you? Also, apprently NASA and the space agencies are sending dwarfs to the these moons and planets as I feel like Im 3 feet tall. When an astoroid hits the surface, it doesn't kick up any particles or dust, it hits and bounces off apprently in this game. The Mars DLC is 2,99, for the same thing you do on the Moon, THE SAME THING, YOU WALK FOR AROUND 10 MINS, ARRIVE AT WHERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GO AND THE OTHER PERSON IS DEAD. To be honest, the screen shots did look good. It just didn't meet everyones expectations. Make it like a simulator if it is one. Make it realistic, why go looking for a way home to Earth, when in this game its so close you could float back. I highly don't recommend this game as it is a waste of space, maybe they'll update it some day to make it an actual simulator.","February 11","false","0.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't listen to them.\n\nIt as much as a development game as to see how it would be like in space stranded with potentail hazards of falling *Space rocks * from the moon's sky.\n\nThere is potential of how this game could be worked out , its main mechanic is supposed to be a simulator. Not some high tech fancy Call of Duty Black Ops 3 Space battles you are all familier with.\n\nIt is ment to be a horror game and with specs to use a VR headset to *simulate * the feeling of being alone in space. Never knowing the dangers of being in space. Your oxygen tank takes damage to *being hit* with space debris falling at you in a constant rate. Also you may take *damage* to your oxygen otherwise as it takes time to get to place to place. So it makes you want to be wary of whats up above you and around you. And the worry of making it back with your reserve tanks becomign low and the meteores falling down at you makes it more unsettling of you making it back.\n\nThe time alone I have may show I didn't spend much but I played offline for countless hours. Trying to get to the unknown signals left stranded in the open moonscape.\n\nThe lack of choosing a option to see what to do in the world leaves me a bit unease to figure out that if hitting buttons is my first thought. No tutorial or such. Even to mapping keys. I was left with my screen showing that I had no *Primary* fire or alt fire button. And 3 other misc buttons that could be possible left in development.\n\nThe scene's are leaving my eyes a bit sore after about 30 mins into looking the moonworld. The constant wierd glossy on the below of my screen made my eyes become irritant and quickly had to take a break for 15 before diving in again. The *buttons not configured* overlap your HUD's radar of seeing your signals makes it quite harder to even look down as your radar is barely visable due to the *weird* glossy shiny moon texture. Yet it still felt to me that even looking ahead of you and trying to reach the signals and hoping you reach some goal. It lead me to keep going even with the moon looking like a shiny marble on a table.\n\nThe game however has a *Zoom* (Right Mouse Button) button and you can descend a lot slower (Holding Space bar) upon going into deep chasms or just wanting to dive into a huge crater.\n\n\n\nThe Pros\n\n* Its a space horror simuation.\n* Its Free\n* Potentail hours wasted if you're into the sort of simulations\n\n\nThe Cons\n\n* Lack of Options and controls.\n* Still buggy as to 1.4d Patch - EXPECT BUGS - STILL NEW -\n* Lack of Teaching players what to do.\n\n\nOverall I give this a 6.5 out of 10.\n\nIt has great potential, but made in the wrong aspects. Great Simulation, somewhat lofty controls. *Hell its space, what you expect?* No tutorial.\n\nIf you're into the youtube Let's play gigs. This is ment for you~\n\n","February 1","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is what amounts to a bunch of art assets, sound, and a UI toolkit thrown together to make a "game". I played for a while -- not sure why I did, other than morbid curiosity -- and realized the game is actually quite pointless.\n\nThis is literally a walking simulator. The gimmick is: you're on the moon with every asteroid in the Van Allen belt being hurled exactly on target with you. You have no warning about asteroids coming at you from the sides, and will get hit periodically (though this seems to actually have no effect on the game). Also, it's impossible to get to any of the "Unknown signals" save for one, which happens to be closest to the crash site -- there are invisible walls preventing further progress when you get to about 500M of each.\n\nButton is not in VP Input Manager's Buttons.

Upon playing the game i found manty problems with it. For one you cant interact with any signals that you find, i dont know if that is intential or not, but it would be nice for there to be some way of confirming which signals you have been to. Another MAJOR problem I encountered was that of the invisible walls, it is annoying that I travel 2000m only to be cut off 700m away from a signal by an invisible wall. I encountered this problem many times and it only allowed for me to visit two of the beacons the rest were just unreacable.\n\nI would defininetly pay money for a game like this, if it was to fix it's bugs, make it more user friendly and maybe add a bit of story to it. I like the idea of running around the moon/mars searching for the correct signal, it makes me have hope that the one that i am traveling towards is the correct one.\n\n4/10 - Great Idea, poor gameplay.

Shouldn't multiple strikes somehow damage my suit? Maybe I'd not have noticed any of this if my mind hadn't been so free to wander... something which shouldn't really happen in a video game.

So youre an astronaut and you have to get to the rest of your crew before you oxygen runs out, however, there is also a few other signals that are a result of your helmet glitching and you only have enough oxygen to get to only 2 or 3 signals. So lets pick a few subjects and talk about them.\n\n-Enemies\n\nTheres only one major enemy in the game. Asteroids. They come at you constantly and you have to keep dodging them in order to survive. Not the worst idea ive ever heard, but still not a good one. First of all, why did they send us to the moon (and also Mars) and not send us equiptment or anything for these astroids? And second, why are there so many of them? The only other enemies which arent really enemies but more like game mechanics are your limited oxygen and the other signals.\n\n-Gameplay\n\nIts slow. Very slow. Have you ever played an open world game and slowy walking to one place to another? I hope you like moments like that because thats what this game is. Theres not much to see but i guess thats what should be expected and y ou cant really blame them because its the moon (or Mars) and theres not much there besides rock (or sand or whatever Mars is made out of).\n\n-Graphics\n\nNothing awful really. Not Beautiful but still nothing too bad. Once again you cant really blame them for something like how the moon (or Mars) looks but for what isnt ground or giant rocks that hate your face isnt anything bad good so its a little past the middle.\n\nNow for some questions I have about the game.\n\n1. Why does it seem like im really short when I walk? Im pretty sure that toddlers cant be in space.\n2. What happens when i get to an astronaut? According to the game I only landed far away from the other astronauts so what do we do when i get to them? Did they all land at the base or where this mission is about and I just landed really far away?\n3.Why isnt there anything for me to do besides just walking to where everyone else is? Could I send some sort of signal or do ANYTHING ELSE THAN WALKING? Is there not some sort of code or ANYTHING for this kind of situation?!\n4. Why are we on the moon? Mars i can understand because of thing like how theres water there and also trees can grow there and all of that but the moon? Theres almost nothing explaining why and i would like to know.\n\nAnyway thats all I have to say about the game. And also this game isnt very good if you couldnt tell (and in conclusion, or Mars).","February 9","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The moon is not this close. Also, since when do astoriods hit the surface of the moon and mars and then FLING of back into space. They BOUNCE off the surface in this game. Also, why is there this many astoroids hitting Mars and the moon, this man astoroids coming towards the moon, one is bound to miss and hit the Earth. Its extremely blury to the point were you can't see and the games graphics look poor. If this is a simulator, then at least make it like one. The lack of knowing what is going on in this game confuses you, you literally hit play and are suddenly on the moon or mars. After crashing, I don't know how. Also, does your character have some gravitational pull greater then the moon or Mars that guides the astoroids toward you? Also, apprently NASA and the space agencies are sending dwarfs to the these moons and planets as I feel like Im 3 feet tall. When an astoroid hits the surface, it doesn't kick up any particles or dust, it hits and bounces off apprently in this game. The Mars DLC is 2,99, for the same thing you do on the Moon, THE SAME THING, YOU WALK FOR AROUND 10 MINS, ARRIVE AT WHERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GO AND THE OTHER PERSON IS DEAD. To be honest, the screen shots did look good. It just didn't meet everyones expectations. Make it like a simulator if it is one. Make it realistic, why go looking for a way home to Earth, when in this game its so close you could float back. I highly don't recommend this game as it is a waste of space, maybe they'll update it some day to make it an actual simulator.","February 11","false","0.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

You start off crash landed on the moon with a limited amount of supply of oxygen and you have to pick a random beacon on the map.  Then you pray to god the beacon you made it to works and someone comes and saves you before you run out of oxygen.  For some godforsaken reason while you are running for your life to the beacon and running out of o2 there are meteors coming at you in only the direction you are running.  I then noticed at all times there are two spacestations hovering above your head at all time.  The reason for this is the Developers installed a HAL unit in each station.  You being Dave Bowman have jepordized the mission to mine the moon the find the monolith, the HAL units have colluded to kill you and purposfully crash landed you on the moon after hijacking the controls of your escape pod.  When you crash you hit your head hard causing you to have amnesia.  HAL tries to trick you because he knows this and tries to get you to waste your o2 trying to find the beacons.  Each space station is equiped with a gravity cannon and HAL uses this to hurl large moon rocks at you from the far side of the moon.  Once you understand this your true goal in this game is to find the Monolith.  When you find the Monolith then the game really begins when you enter god mode when you Dave Bowman are absorbed by the Monolith.  Lol I can't believe no one got past the first level.  Best game ever!!!","January 21","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm trying not to call it a game since the developers themselves call it a tech demo and it's a bad one at that. If you want to play this and experience for yourself, I'm not going to stop you.\n\nTLDR:\nGood\n-Decent concept\n-Random terrain each time you play\n-Critical thinking and prioritising required\n-HUD warning system for asteroids\n\nBad\n-Meteors are supposed to be a threat, but slowly start spawning farther and farther away\n-Being struck by meteors with no warning until after you're hit\n-Lack of sound. There is only the sound of you breathing and a looping song\n-The white text can be hidden by the environment and the yellow text can be hard to read\n-Cursor on screen which is distracting\n-I could only reach 1 signal because invisible walls prevented me from reaching the others\n-So boring I almost fell asleep\n\nA waste of 35 minutes. Don't get me wrong, the concept isn't bad: you only have a limited amount of oxygen which is constantly dwindling and you have to make it to one of 5 signals hoping your fellow astronauts are there. It's really frustrating when I can only make it to the closest signal (approximately 1600 meters from starting position or a 10-12 minute moon walk) and then hit invisible walls preventing me from reaching any of the other signals.\n\nThe meteors are a threat for the first 5 minutes. After that they start spawning farther away. The first warnings were when they were almost 500 meters away, then 1000, then 2500 and vanishing or exploding before even becoming a threat.\n\nWhile I get that the game takes place in an environment with no air, hearing some kind of sound effects from the meteors hitting the surface or even the player would have been nice. Hearing something other than the monotonous drone of the music and the player breathing would have been greatly appreciated. Some kind of suit beeping, warning system, anything.","January 21","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This made me feel like i was not getting anywhere, i will talk more about that in a bit.\n2) All the terrain is almost identical. Yes, i understand it is a free to play game and the devs wanted it to be long, but it was really boring, especially if you go to a wrong signal, and go ALL THE WAY to another one. This along with #1 drove me kind of insane.\n3) The walking animation is really really wobbly. I mean it might as well be going in 360's as it is a pain to know if you are going in the right way.\n4) The astroids. The ONLY things getting in your way apart from the way itself. Isnt it weird that they all target towards you? And it dosent lock on to the location, it locks on to YOU. GGWP of you devs. *sarcasm*\n\nI can keep going on, but i do not want to look like i am hating on the game.

So youre an astronaut and you have to get to the rest of your crew before you oxygen runs out, however, there is also a few other signals that are a result of your helmet glitching and you only have enough oxygen to get to only 2 or 3 signals. So lets pick a few subjects and talk about them.\n\n-Enemies\n\nTheres only one major enemy in the game. Asteroids. They come at you constantly and you have to keep dodging them in order to survive. Not the worst idea ive ever heard, but still not a good one. First of all, why did they send us to the moon (and also Mars) and not send us equiptment or anything for these astroids? And second, why are there so many of them? The only other enemies which arent really enemies but more like game mechanics are your limited oxygen and the other signals.\n\n-Gameplay\n\nIts slow. Very slow. Have you ever played an open world game and slowy walking to one place to another? I hope you like moments like that because thats what this game is. Theres not much to see but i guess thats what should be expected and y ou cant really blame them because its the moon (or Mars) and theres not much there besides rock (or sand or whatever Mars is made out of).\n\n-Graphics\n\nNothing awful really. Not Beautiful but still nothing too bad. Once again you cant really blame them for something like how the moon (or Mars) looks but for what isnt ground or giant rocks that hate your face isnt anything bad good so its a little past the middle.\n\nNow for some questions I have about the game.\n\n1. Why does it seem like im really short when I walk? Im pretty sure that toddlers cant be in space.\n2. What happens when i get to an astronaut? According to the game I only landed far away from the other astronauts so what do we do when i get to them? Did they all land at the base or where this mission is about and I just landed really far away?\n3.Why isnt there anything for me to do besides just walking to where everyone else is? Could I send some sort of signal or do ANYTHING ELSE THAN WALKING? Is there not some sort of code or ANYTHING for this kind of situation?!\n4. Why are we on the moon? Mars i can understand because of thing like how theres water there and also trees can grow there and all of that but the moon? Theres almost nothing explaining why and i would like to know.\n\nAnyway thats all I have to say about the game. And also this game isnt very good if you couldnt tell (and in conclusion, or Mars).","February 9","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since I had 80% Oxygen or so remaining, I decided to head to the second closest signal, (It was only 1,000 feet away! that means only 5 more minutes of nothing!) when I saw asteroids that normally would disappear in the sky, start hitting an invisible wall and bounce off it. I found out at 832M from the other signal that there was a huge invisible wall blocking my path. I traced this wall until 45% Oxygen remained, not finding a path around it.","November 25, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shouldn't multiple strikes somehow damage my suit? Maybe I'd not have noticed any of this if my mind hadn't been so free to wander... something which shouldn't really happen in a video game. So again... Engage the player! Keep them invested... as far as I could tell this game was just me listening to a track of heavy breathing mixed over some tranquil music.\n\n","December 10, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So youre an astronaut and you have to get to the rest of your crew before you oxygen runs out, however, there is also a few other signals that are a result of your helmet glitching and you only have enough oxygen to get to only 2 or 3 signals. So lets pick a few subjects and talk about them.\n\n-Enemies\n\nTheres only one major enemy in the game. Asteroids. They come at you constantly and you have to keep dodging them in order to survive. Not the worst idea ive ever heard, but still not a good one. First of all, why did they send us to the moon (and also Mars) and not send us equiptment or anything for these astroids? And second, why are there so many of them? The only other enemies which arent really enemies but more like game mechanics are your limited oxygen and the other signals.\n\n-Gameplay\n\nIts slow. Very slow. Have you ever played an open world game and slowy walking to one place to another? I hope you like moments like that because thats what this game is. Theres not much to see but i guess thats what should be expected and y ou cant really blame them because its the moon (or Mars) and theres not much there besides rock (or sand or whatever Mars is made out of).\n\n-Graphics\n\nNothing awful really. Not Beautiful but still nothing too bad. Once again you cant really blame them for something like how the moon (or Mars) looks but for what isnt ground or giant rocks that hate your face isnt anything bad good so its a little past the middle.\n\nNow for some questions I have about the game.\n\n1. Why does it seem like im really short when I walk? Im pretty sure that toddlers cant be in space.\n2. What happens when i get to an astronaut? According to the game I only landed far away from the other astronauts so what do we do when i get to them? Did they all land at the base or where this mission is about and I just landed really far away?\n3.Why isnt there anything for me to do besides just walking to where everyone else is? Could I send some sort of signal or do ANYTHING ELSE THAN WALKING? Is there not some sort of code or ANYTHING for this kind of situation?!\n4. Why are we on the moon? Mars i can understand because of thing like how theres water there and also trees can grow there and all of that but the moon? Theres almost nothing explaining why and i would like to know.\n\nAnyway thats all I have to say about the game. And also this game isnt very good if you couldnt tell (and in conclusion, or Mars).","February 9","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I guess it can get better, but at this moment is not very recommendable.

The moon is not this close. Also, since when do astoriods hit the surface of the moon and mars and then FLING of back into space. They BOUNCE off the surface in this game. Also, why is there this many astoroids hitting Mars and the moon, this man astoroids coming towards the moon, one is bound to miss and hit the Earth. Its extremely blury to the point were you can't see and the games graphics look poor. If this is a simulator, then at least make it like one. The lack of knowing what is going on in this game confuses you, you literally hit play and are suddenly on the moon or mars. After crashing, I don't know how. Also, does your character have some gravitational pull greater then the moon or Mars that guides the astoroids toward you? Also, apprently NASA and the space agencies are sending dwarfs to the these moons and planets as I feel like Im 3 feet tall. When an astoroid hits the surface, it doesn't kick up any particles or dust, it hits and bounces off apprently in this game. The Mars DLC is 2,99, for the same thing you do on the Moon, THE SAME THING, YOU WALK FOR AROUND 10 MINS, ARRIVE AT WHERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GO AND THE OTHER PERSON IS DEAD. To be honest, the screen shots did look good. It just didn't meet everyones expectations. Make it like a simulator if it is one. Make it realistic, why go looking for a way home to Earth, when in this game its so close you could float back. I highly don't recommend this game as it is a waste of space, maybe they'll update it some day to make it an actual simulator.","February 11","false","0.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

I have no problem with this feature, if only it actually worked. Death is a very hard thing to achieve in this game. The closest you can get to death is a bloody screen and the word 'Dead' on your O2 meter.\n\nGraphics are not overly bad in this game. I only have a standard quality graphics card and it ran smoothly on it. The wallpaper that is meant to be space is rather inacurate. The size of some of the satelites would mean that they had been somehow frozen in time as they fell towards the Moon (unlike the unrealistic amount of generic meteorites only capable of making you blead out of your face). The walking animation is just... interesting. It seems as though you are attempting to take the longest strides you possibly can in an attempt to walk the 3 miles a bit faster.\n\nThe objective of the moon map (as issued by a 10 year old sounding boy/girl) is to locate other team members before your oxygen runs out. There are too many issues with this objective. You don't find team members, you find small metal flashing objects laying on the floor. These objects cannot be activated and 4/5 of them cannot even be reached. Invisible walls stop you from reaching most of the objectives. Meaning you just spent 20-30 minutes walking towards a piece of metal and a wall.\n\n10 minutes after my O2 meter started reading 'Dead', the meteorites stopped hitting the ground. Instead they just despawned in the sky above me. Unfortunately for me, this was when I was contemplating running into the meteorites in order to attempt to kill myself and end it all. I decided to head back to the crash site and wait for the game to just kill me. In the end, I just quit of boredom.\n\nIf you plan on confirming the functionality of your 'w' key or your steam uninstall feature then this is a good game for you!","March 24","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I get that it is early access but the game is broken beyond all belief. The concept is there but it is poorly executed.

I found myself getting continually hurt for no reason because i could not see things behind me or I was just losing oxygen randomly. is there anything good here. Yes. You could go anywhere with this concept. Just add more planets (That arent flipping dlc) and add more interesting layouts and threats. and you have a good game. But its just a game of walk forward, holding the w button and doing something else on the side, getting bombarded by rocks, getting stuck on invisible walls, trying to get around said invisible walls, and promptly giving up.

I began walking forward, got about 40 meters out when BAM, and advanced life-form that can teleport came out of no where and bashed my skull in. This life-forms name? Meteors. This brought down my O2 levels to approximately 80%. Don't ask me why getting my skull bashed in brought down my O2 levels because I don't know. (Maybe it depletes faster because of a crack and that's just how it shows it?)\n\nAfter that point I took note: Dodge the rocks. Now, in theory this would be fairly simple, just predict their paths and move out the way. In this case, it's wrong. You waddle like a penguin that has a bowling ball strapped to the side of his head. After walking past a few more low-poly rocks, I came across a valley that seemed to have a marker in the middle of it. I decided to head to it.\n\nAfter jumping about 17m in the air I came waddling down incline and reached the flats of the valley. Moving forward another 500m and dodging all the space rocks, I found a small device that I have no idea what it is. I tried the normal buttons to press in a game when interacting with something, (E, mouse-click, even tried middle mouse.) After failing I decided to look at the controls again in the menu, so I press my trusty Escape button and go to press "Options." I also fail in doing this because I press the Restart button. Do not ask why they have a restart button, because I don't know. The game even opens up with saying, "This game will not hold your hand. Once you die, you die."\n\nSo why would we even use the restart button?\n\nThe most likely answer to this question is they accounted for every single invisible wall you run into. If you get caught in the wrong corner, you're stuck. So once I restarted I decided to try and bash my skull into every meteor that flew by, hoping it would end my suffering and this infernal nightmare. But then I thought...\n\nI control this.\n\nI have the power to stop this.\n\nI used my powerful skill "Escape Quit" and returned home; scarred for life, but living.\n\nI'm here to share my story, and to prevent others from sharing my fate. Now quickly, run away. Go back to your families with your loved ones and cherish every moment because soon... The advanced life-forms will find a way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey always do.","April 26","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It isn't that bad, but it's repetitive.\n\nSome HUD sounds- I was annoyed with the space boulders hurdling at me Indiana Jones style without much of a warning. That red indicator doesn't really do much.\n\nMore "stuff"- To be honest, the game felt quite empty. For example, try spicing up the environment a little bit.\n\nBetter walking animation- I seriously hope you didn't put that in on purpose.\n\n\n\nThings it needs to remove:\nHeat seeking projectiles- Definitely needs less of this.\n\nInflatable astronaut men- They look really fake.\n\nInvisible walls- This is what really ticked me off into putting this as a negative review.\n\nI don't hate this game, but it felt like a simple curiosity on the Steam store.
