There is no online multiplayer whatsoever.\n\nSpectacular battle arena-type game focused on fast-paced bow and arrow oriented combat, with mechanics that are very approachable and, for the most part, easy to figure out on your own. The relative transparency of its mechanics does not, however, mean that it is an easy game to master. The game has a high skill ceiling, with substantial room for the player to improve. A notable feature is the added dimension of screen wrapping - players or objects that pass through the bottom of the screen will come out through the top, left side through the right, and vice versa. Should you decide to pick the game up, you will soon discover what a devilish thing this can be.\n\nThe game is split into three modes: Versus, Co-op, and Trials. The Versus mode pits 2-4 players against one another in one of three different sub-modes, all focused on killing the opposing players, with a large number of game modifiers available that change the games in a variety of ways. There are a large number of stages available, some of which have to be unlocked through various means. Co-op mode (perhaps more aptly called "Quest mode", as it can be played and enjoyed perfectly well as a solo experience) is a mode that pits you and a friend (up to three friends in the expansion's version of co-op) against waves of different enemies on each of the themed maps. There's not much more to it than that, but it is enjoyable and provides for some challenge if you're going for achievements. Lastly, Trials is a time trial mode that challenges you to destroy a number of dummies as quickly as possible with the tools available in each stage. It's somewhat maddening, but engrossing for the obsessive.\n\nThe game has a simple, charming aesthetic, and a suitably valiant soundtrack.\n\nOverall there is little about the game that I can fault. The most notable flaw is its lack of online multiplayer, the exclusion of which may well have been intentional, as the game appears to have been constructed to strongly encourage getting together and duking it out with a group of friends. Even so, I would recommend it as a singleplayer game due to its inherent charm and the challenges it provides in its Quest and Trial modes, although I imagine a lot of people would disagree with me on this point. I'm just a sucker for a good challenge wrapped into a neat little package. I expect I will be returning to this game many times in the future.","November 1, 2015","true","54.8"," 45 of 46 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","45","46","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/251470/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","TowerFall Ascension is an arena type game. This game was released in March 2014, after initially being released as an Ouya exclusive in 2013 (snarf). It is now on PC, PS4 and Mac/Linux.\n\nTowerFall's arena type gameplay focuses heavily on archery. The game has two modes; firstly the single player - the aim is to kill targets around each stage either by stomping on their heads, or by shooting them with your bow before a timer runs out; this leaves to plenty of replaying of levels in order to better your score and to beat your best time.\n\nWhere TowerFall really shines is in the multiplayer mode. Up to four players will fight in a battle royal environment. Your aim is simple, kill or be killed. Each player has a limited amount of arrows to do it in too, so you can't just spam fire and hope you get lucky. You are able to replenish your ammo by picking up rogue arrows shot by yourself and the others though, meaning things can get very frantic. Throughout the stage, there will also be various different power-ups spawn, such as special effects on your arrows or shields - these all add to the extremely fast paced gameplay.\n\nThe graphics and art style, yet again have the pixelated theme, but they are still all really well drawn out and it looks very pleasant. Each of the arenas that you are fighting in also look amazing too, some will be set in the jungle, others in a poorly lit cave, they all look gorgeous.\n\nSingle player in TowerFall Ascension is easy; you can easily clear the stages in less than an hour. Where the difficulty ramps up like most games is the multiplayer. It will only be as difficult as your opponents are, as they are they only thing that can kill you; you don't need to worry about the environment playing tricks against you.  It will take you a few hours to get to a point where you are competent in games; it can be very frustrating though.\n\nI have been playing TowerFall for almost eight hours now; I would say that this is a game to play in small chunks. Bring it out when you have friends over for an hour of almost archery style Super Smash Bro fun, but any more than that, and you may find yourself getting a little bored.  This is certainly a game to keep installed due to the replay-ability though.\n\nThe game supports resolutions up to 1080P, which I suppose is all you need for a pixel style game like this and it is highly recommended you play this game with a game pad; keyboard controls would be a nightmare.\n\nTo conclude, I am going to simply recommend TowerFall Ascension; its a game that not everyone will enjoy, and is almost certainly made with couch multiplayer in mind. If you don't have friends who also own this game, don't get it, the single player is not worth it. If you can find a group to play with, sure its worth the £10,99 because of the fun fast paced gameplay you'll get out of it.\n\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It's the funniest game of this genre I have played locally since the bomberman sness one. It's that good, it's a masterpiece.\n\n2/ There are long time technical issues that are not fixed.\nThere is no network mode.\nThe default bindings of the pad and the keyboard are not really good and worse, you cant rebind them ingame.\nThe game recognizes only xbox pads (which are not very good for the price)\n3/ the solo and coop game are terrible.\nIt seems those modes have been put on top of the real game afterwards, as they are not properly designed. The levels are full of choke points, and the only challenge the game can throw at the player is overwhelming him with more entities, not clever enemy design, not clever mapping.\nSolo mode is a grinding chore.\nTimings are not properly tweaked, making use of the movement combos awkward and combined with the bindings the game isnt a fast flowing movement and fighting game anymore but an exercise in memory where you try to find the perfect way to beat every level by doing the same thing again and again.\nAnd even that is defeated by the game choice to enter a little bit of randomness in the entities start position, which changes nothing but just add to the time you need to pass to know every pattern.\n\nI understand that this game is a one man operation and came from an other platform. This could explain some of the technical difficulties or some bad design choice. As I said it is still one of the best game ever in local multi.\nBut those issues have been tackled to death by other games for a long time and they are resolved by other one-man games. Take a look at spelunky. Wether you like it or not, the timings of the entities, the reaction of the pad, everything is 100% precise and you can rebind controls.\nThe game could have somehow worked in solo mode too and warrant a recommandation if some of those issues had been taken care of.\nIn 2015, even if your game is an indie game with a retro look, we can't accept this kind of backward usability issues.","February 18, 2015","false","30.1"," 325 of 501 people (65%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","65","325","501","14","11"

TowerFall is that experience and more. Matches are fierce and exciting. They are the perfect length to allow players to rotate out without feeling too short. You’ll be cheering and yelling alongside everyone else as you wait for your turn.\n\nTowerFall is a masterclass example of intentional game design. Nothing feels out of place or missing. The controls and pacing have been fine tuned to create the best possible experience.\n\nWhile multiplayer is the main focus, and is amazing, there is a substantial amount of single player content. I’d like to focus on that in this review since everyone else is going to talk about multiplayer.\n\nIn quest mode you take on waves of enemies with a friend or by yourself. There’s one level for every tower with normal and hardcore difficulties, which I would rename to hardcore and insane. Waves and enemy movement are not random, they have been carefully designed to provide a varied and challenging experience. Even the simplest of enemies can be a huge obstacle with so much going on at once. The boss fights are epic too.\n\nPerhaps the most challenging mode in TowerFall is trials mode. It’s like break-the-targets in Smash Bros. but way more intense. Each trial is like a puzzle -- figure out the optimal way to beat it -- then figure out how to pull it off. Gold times are set so someone moderately good at the game might have a chance with practice. Diamond times are even harder with most set to under a few seconds. It feels very satisfying when you pull it off. Each trial feels unique and like the game is trying to teach you something.\n\nTowerFall is a beautiful game with an insane amount of visual polish. While its character and environment designs stand out, the details and animation are what puts it over the top. Everything from how the character moves to the environment details such as dripping water or crumbling skeletons.\n\nThis review is not complete without talking about the audio design. Each character has a unique set of sound effects. This not only gives them individual personalities but also lets you know what’s happening elsewhere on the screen. The soundtrack is also worthy of much praise. Each tower has a unique track that matches the visuals perfectly. It echos the gameplay both in tempo and mood and tells a story at the same time.\n\nMultiplayer is what you buy the game for but single player is very good too. TowerFall is an amazing game and is worth both your time and money.","March 8, 2014","true","73.7"," 231 of 353 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","231","353","2","1"

I had this on my wishlist for quite some time, but for some reason I couldn't match up what I would see on the trailers with the overwhelmingly positive reviews. What was it about this title that had people so wrapped up in it? Let me try to explain:\n\n1. The controls are excellent. Only a few buttons, yet there is sooo much difference between being skilled at it, which requires a fairly complete understanding of the system, and being ‘meh’. It seems simple at the start, where you are clunkily platforming around the levels (at the time you think its just fine), until you start learning how to 'dodge-cancel' and soon enough you will be flying around in a way you would have previously thought impossible.\n\n2. All the action takes place on a single screen. This allows for purely awesome couch co-op or versus. TowerFall revels in how simple it feels, but yet has many layers of complexity that it rolls back as you dig in.\n\n3. The action is fast and furious. It doesn’t get any better than this, as far as couch co-op or versus goes. I even had friends playing this that would never touch a platformer. I mean it was complex enough for a serious gamer, yet could draw in newbs. Tons of mode customization as well, and lots of cool trophy unlocks (tons actually) and statistics that keep me coming back for more.\n\nCaveat: the only  deal-breaker for this game, is that you must have controllers, and you must have friends willing to come over and sit on the couch to play local. If you don’t have this, go elsewhere. Single player is really fun since I look at it as training, but other than that, I would not recommend just for single player experience.\n\nI could go on and on, but at the end of the day – I am hooked. I think my friends may be hooked as well. At this point, it’s my favorite game at the moment, and I plan to get many hours out of it (I even set up a competition and invited 8-10 people over in early June 2015).","May 19, 2015","true","24.8"," 25 of 40 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","25","40","3","0"

I've cleared all stages on Legendary without continues. Going to try for no death runs next.\n\nI love everything about it. I've mostly only played solo but I'm glad there's 4 player co-op now. My only request would be that the two campains are merged allowing for 4 player in the Ascension Quest. The problem would be unifying the difficulty system and reseting everyones achievements so I can see why it wasn't done, I still think it would be a nice addition.\n\nI don't miss the scoring system. All the stages have an achievement for clearing the highest difficulty with no deaths, this being the highest achievement pretty much made the scoring superfluous. Additionally the game now tracks fastest times which I think is a much more easily understood and meaningful measure of skill. Speed runners rejoice! The Dark World campaign isn't overly long and be cleared on the easier difficulty in around an hour, but those who enjoyed playing for gold skulls in the Ascension Quest will get a lot out of playing for the harder achievements.\n\nPrism arrows I think are designed to affect high level competitive play, where no one misses a dodge catch, in which case it makes a significant change to the meta game. Trigger arrows are fun but damn is it easy to SD with. There is such a huge number of arrow varieties now that adding more might start to subtract from what makes each arrow interesting, as well as increasing the barrier of entry for newcomers. Haven't had a chance to play much versus yet but the Dark World content should make a great addition.\n\nAlso love the additional Trials stages. It's a part of the game I didn't expect myself to take so much pleasure in, but once you start aiming for the red pearl dev times the mode becomes a kind of rewarding puzzle game, though it does play havoc on my RSI and I fear my controller will crumble in my hands before I ever clear them all.\n\nAll in all I love every bit of TowerFall and can't wait to see what Matt works on next, TowerFall or otherwise.","May 16, 2015","true","281.2"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

There really aren't many alternatives when it comes to Steam party games. I suppose if you're someone with a Steambox who is just realizing Half Life 2 and Sakura Spirits do not make for very good party games, it may be worth the investment. Otherwise, just bust out the Gamecube.  Play some smash bros.\n\nI'm not saying the game isn't a unique experience. The archery is fun, but it has its problems.  In Co-Op/Singleplayer you can only shoot in 8 directions, and your arrows will curve slightly towards any enemy. On a couple occasions I was trying to shoot something directly above me. So I shot up, but the arrow curved  towards a closer enemy who was above and to the left. It missed him then tried to curve and hit my original target. Ended up missing both stationary enemies.\n\nPlaying alone is not very fun. Thats alright, most party games aren't meant to be played solo. A lack of Online really sucks. Some website named Polygon even wrote an article on why you don't want Online in this game. Which was all I saw when googling if there would ever be online. I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the dev told them to write that so Steam reviews would stop complaining about it. An easy fix would be to add a LAN mode.  Normal people are forced to play the way the dev intended it.  But those who live out in the middle of nowhere can still use Hamachi to play with a friend.\n\nThere was also going to be a map editor but the $10 dlc was of greater priority. Make your own conclusion on whether you want to support that or not.\n\n","May 20, 2015","false","8.2"," 45 of 82 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","45","82","2","3"

One of those 'easy to learn, hard to master' type deals. The mechanics are solid, it controls well, and once everybody is familiar with it you can have some incredibly intense and fun games with your buddies. Luck plays a big part early on, but once you get the hang of it, your deaths are very rarely anybody else's fault but your own.\n\nAt its best the game is satisfyingly choreographic - players leap and grapple from ledge to ledge, shots collide mid-air, arrows can be dodged (and caught mid-air) with the right timing, corpses are pinned to walls, and the instant replay at the end of each round allows you to enjoy the sheer frenzy of what just happened at your leisure.\n\nLook up some multiplayer gameplay videos for the game on YouTube, those are going to be the best gauge of whether or not you're going to enjoy what's on offer here.\n\nIgnore the reviews complaining that the single player isn't strong. This is a multiplayer game. If you bought it for the single player, it's your own fault that you're not enjoying it. It's a bonus there's even a solo mode included in the game.","June 15, 2015","true","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Reminds me of the good old days of N64 and PS2/Gamecube.\n\nThe bottom line is, if you don't have friends living nearby and you don't have at least one controller, you probably shouldn't buy this game.

Well gather around and I shall tell you a story about Dungeons and Dragons... On second thought I will just tell you about Towerfall.\n\nStory: If you are looking for an enriching story, look somewhere else. You won't find it here. There is a story, but its all spoiled by the trailer on this page.\n\nGraphics: If you are looking for the next generation of graphics, you definitely won't find it here. But you probably already know that since you probably watched the trailer that spoiled the story. Good artstyle though.\n\nGameplay: If you like zipping through levels at high speed with no second thought whatsoever, then you will almost immediately die. This game requires a lot of thought and skill. Sometimes you will lose visibility of your character since there are going to be some split second decisions. LET ME STRESS THIS: YOU WILL DIE A LOT!\n\nBIG CRITICISM I HAVE (NOTICE THE CAPS): THIS GAME HAS NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER. TOWERFALL IS BASICALLY ASKING TO HAVE AN ONLINE COMPONENT TO IT. I FOUND MYSELF ON THE LAST LEVEL THINKING I NEED SOME HELP TO GET THROUGH THIS. BUT WILL I EVER FIND THE HELP THAT I NEED? NOPE! (I DON'T SEE MY FRIENDS TO OFTEN, SO I CAN'T EXACTLY PLAY LOCAL MULTIPLAYER.) VERSUS MODE NEEDS ONLINE MULTIPLAYER. BIG OPPORTUNITY MISSED.\nTHE TIME TRIAL MODE IS ANOTHER THING THAT I HAVE BEEF WITH. THE TIME TRIALS AREN'T REALLY FUN AT ALL. THERE IS NOTHING REDEEMING ABOUT THEM. ONCE YOU GET DONE WITH IT, YOU WILL PROBABLY NEVER GO BACK TO IT. THIS COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN FIXED WITH A online (lowercase for emphasis) LEADERBOARD. MAKING IT A COMPETITION TO GET ONE OF THE FASTEST TIMES WOULD HAVE MADE IT A TON BETTER AND WOULD HAVE CAUGHT MY EYE A LITTLE MORE.\nTHE CHARACTERS ARE THE SAME. THERE IS NO DIFFERING QUALITIES THAT MAKE THE CHARACTERS UNIQUE ASIDE FROM THEIR NAMES AND COSTUMES. THEY ALL PLAY THE SAME AND THEY ALL USE A BOW AND ARROW. I THINK THAT THIS GAME WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE INTERESTING IF THERE WERE DIFFERING WEAPONS AND PLAYSTYLES FOR EACH CHARACTER. IT WOULD HAVE EASILY BEEFED UP THE REPLAY VALUE IN THIS GAME. INSTEAD, I FOUND MYSELF USING WHICH EVER CHARACTER I LANDED ON AFTER I CLOSED MY EYES AND COUNTED TO 5 AS I SCROLLED THROUGH ALL THE CHARACTERS. THE GAMEPLAY IS SO REPETITIVE (but it is fun) THAT CHOOSING A DIFFERENT CHARACTER DOESN'T REALLY MATTER. I THINK THE ONLY REASON WHY THEY ADDED ALL THESE CHARACTERS IS BECAUSE OF THE VERSUS MODE. A MODE WHICH THEY FORGOT TO PUT online IN.\n\nFinal Verdict: If you like repetitive gameplay, no depth in story or characters, no online multiplayer, a game mode that doesn't have any redeeming qualities whatsoever, and a game that you will pay $15 for and will last you about 3 hours just to do the main campaign, then this is the perfect game for you.\nBut seriously this game is by no means bad. The gameplay is top notch and will last you a lot more than 3 hours. The replay value is definitely there, but it could have been a game I could have gotten extremely addicted to if it added all the things I said. THIS GAME COULD HAVE DEFINITELY BENEFITTED FROM HAVING online MULTIPLAYER. If you have friends and you see them a lot, then this game will most likely be perfect for you guys.\n\nAND IF THE DEVELOPERS EVER SEE THIS REVIEW, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY, ADD online!","December 4, 2015","true","6.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It is mainly a 4-player local versus mode but also has 2-player co-op quest mode. If you can get 3 friends to come over and play this you will have a blast. Think of it as a retro style "Goldeneye" of this time. You get plenty of content for what you are paying for. Many maps, modes, weapons and characters to choose from.  The character designs are unique and likeable. Many clever unlockables such as characters and stages. The music is fantastic and memorable, I occasionally get the random songs stuck in my head. The difficulty for quest mode scales nicely throughout the game. You also get a nice time trial mode that will teach you how to get better at the game quick.

At first, I thought of it as just another silly game trying to cash in on the retro 8-bit style but once I actually played it I realized it is much more than that. This game has a lot going for it. It is mainly a 4-player local versus mode but also has 2-player co-op quest mode. If you can get 3 friends to come over and play this you will have a blast. Think of it as a retro style "Goldeneye" of this time. You get plenty of content for what you are paying for. Many maps, modes, weapons and characters to choose from.  The character designs are unique and likeable. Many clever unlockables such as characters and stages. The music is fantastic and memorable, I occasionally get the random songs stuck in my head. The difficulty for quest mode scales nicely throughout the game. You also get a nice time trial mode that will teach you how to get better at the game quick. Great replay value as well.\n\nThere's so many good things to say and I haven't even tried the expansion yet!","October 6, 2015","true","35.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really enjoyed the coop campaign. Levels are short, diverse and challenging. Controls are really simple and every possible move is important (Like dashing, bounce pads, ennemies heads, torches, sticking to walls and using the holes in the map to move around). There is friendly fire, which adds to the challenge. It really brings out a nervous laugh when you ALMOST killed your friend with an arrow, you actually hit his hat off his head, or when you kill yourself with your own arrow and can only blame yourself. The arrows in the game are pleasantly homing, rewarding you putting faith in the homing ability of it. It is quite satisfying. My only complaint was that the story mode is only playable  for 2 players, you need a DLC to play a campaign with 4 players, I didn't understood why.","May 23","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would love to play more, but I do not have anyone too play with.  As this is a local co-op only, I was unable to find anyone to play it and its kinda boring when you play it solo.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaptFuzzyboots/recommended/251470/","CaptFuzzyboots","IG | CaptainFuzzyboots","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaptFuzzyboots/","72 products in account","Towerfall Ascension is just too perfect. It has beautiful, polished pixel art and a game mechanic that never gets old. The controls are very easy to get used to (assuming you are comfortable using a controller in the first place) and feel intuitive and responsive. However, the game is not even the best part. The best part is your friends. A lot of people have complained about the lack of Online multiplayer, but I completely support the developer and long for games that bring back the good old "local multiplayer games" days. AAA games are very sophisticated and everything, but no game (not even TF2!) can give you the fun that you get from having your friends right by your side; Trash talking, High five-ing, howling in frustration and what not. Even writing about this makes me want to play more Towerfall :D\nIt's so great that it has even displaced Fifa 15 as "The game to play" with my friends :D\nTrust me, it may look like I have only a few hours with this game, but I've played this game for nights on end with my friends (offline so it didn't really record it...) and I can assure you we're not going to put this down anytime soon. This definitely is among the greats, even better than the Worms series or anything else that comes to mind at the moment. It's a must buy whether you're just a school-going kid, a college student, or even a total grown up; Because all you need for this game is a bunch of controllers and your best friends! You don't have to put hours into the game because it's really easy to pick up and all the stages are unlockable just by playing versus mode too -- which is a very exciting thing when it happens -- and so you can even sneak in a few rounds during your break (something I do very often :D)\n[Ofcourse, it is best if you hook your laptop up to your TV so that you aren't all crowded around a tiny screen :) ]\nThe Darkfall DLC is also totally worth the price -- It adds a whole lot of powerups to the game and really changes the way you would play it. To end, I can't stress how amazing this game is and how me and my friends spend most of our time talking about Dodge cancelling, or some amazing kill that we had the night before. The only way to truly experience this is to actually play the game, so what are you waiting for?

I have seen veteran gamers and people who don't play games both get hooked on Towerfall after playing just a few rounds. It is that accessible and easy to get into. But that's not to say that it's easy - it'll take countless hours of gameplay to understand the subtle tactics which will allow you to compete at high levels of play.\n\nThe art style and presentation of the game is beautiful and nostalgic to anyone who grew up with games from the SNES era in the 1990's. There is no online multiplayer but the developer has explained why many times: the game is too fast to facilitate satisfying and fair online gameplay. With that said, you will want to be playing this with friends locally because that's the way that it's meant to be played.\n\nRecent updates to Towerfall have brought so much value to the game. I recommend getting the Dark World expansion pack, even more so now that it adds Steam Workshop support. Not only is there a whole new world of user-generated Towerfall content to enjoy, but the way that all of this new content is integrated into the game is brilliant.\n\nIf I could only have one local multiplayer game on Steam, I would probably choose Towerfall. Get some friends together and play Towerfall.","June 11, 2015","true","60.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Didn't expect much. First impression: "uhhh another retro game..."\n\nBut then we started playing ... and we could not stop!!!\n\nBought the expansion "Dark world" soon after the first minutes of game play.\n\nMy recommodations:\nPlay with controllers only. Forget mouse and keyboard.\nPlay with at least two other friends. Better 4 local players.\nUser area settings to adjust treasures, weapons etc. Especially when playing the hard campaigns.\nDo not play alone. That's boring.\nPerfect party game because round can be very short.\nNow this is one of our very favorite local coop games beside Gauntlet, Monaco, Hammerwatch.\n\nI absolutely recommend this game!!!","May 16, 2015","true","5.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It's beautiful while staying very simple, with some unique and creative game mechanics.  That said it's only a local multiplayer and single player game and feels like it was designed foremost for local versus mode.  To really enjoy the game you'll have to have a few controllers and friends or family to play with on a fairly large screen. I mean it feels more like a Console family game than one made for the computer.","May 28, 2015","true","38.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The first night I got it, I played with one friend. Then two. Then we get all four of us playing. By the end of the night we all needed a cup of tea because we'd been screaming at the screen and each other and having a great time.\n\nThe co-op is completely customizable. It's hilarious how much you can screw with the game by dictating starting gear or setting changes. My absolute favorite is to include ghosts so that when you die, you're a ghost trying to get out other players. Also? There's three different multiplayer modes--head hunter, last man standing, and team deathmatch.\n\nThe single player is why I avoided the game at first. I'd seen a review saying that the single player was terrible. And actually, it's not bad. It can be single, or you can have your friends help you through the campaign. I couldn't imagine beating it alone because it's hard with just me and a partner, but I'm sure it's doable. There isn't a *ton* of content, but it's enough to have a good time, for sure. We're almost done with normal mode all through the campaign (on the last level of the expansion) but then we'll have to go back through on hardcore.\nWhat really makes the levels interesting is the bosses. They're cleverly difficult and there's a different way to beat each one.\n\nFinally, the expansion is great. It unlocks some cute aesthetic changes and adds another five or so levels of gameplay to the campaign. So whether or not it's enough content to typically warrant a $10 purchase, we wanted it so bad we bought it anyway.\n\nAll in all, it's been a great investment!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sensualettuce/recommended/251470/","sensualettuce","Sensual Lettuce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sensualettuce/","291 products in account","Towerfall is one of the local multiplayer indie games that I've ever played. I have seen veteran gamers and people who don't play games both get hooked on Towerfall after playing just a few rounds. It is that accessible and easy to get into. But that's not to say that it's easy - it'll take countless hours of gameplay to understand the subtle tactics which will allow you to compete at high levels of play.\n\nThe art style and presentation of the game is beautiful and nostalgic to anyone who grew up with games from the SNES era in the 1990's. There is no online multiplayer but the developer has explained why many times: the game is too fast to facilitate satisfying and fair online gameplay. With that said, you will want to be playing this with friends locally because that's the way that it's meant to be played.\n\nRecent updates to Towerfall have brought so much value to the game. I recommend getting the Dark World expansion pack, even more so now that it adds Steam Workshop support. Not only is there a whole new world of user-generated Towerfall content to enjoy, but the way that all of this new content is integrated into the game is brilliant.\n\nIf I could only have one local multiplayer game on Steam, I would probably choose Towerfall. Get some friends together and play Towerfall.","June 11, 2015","true","60.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaptFuzzyboots/recommended/251470/","CaptFuzzyboots","IG | CaptainFuzzyboots","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaptFuzzyboots/","72 products in account","Towerfall Ascension is just too perfect. It has beautiful, polished pixel art and a game mechanic that never gets old. The controls are very easy to get used to (assuming you are comfortable using a controller in the first place) and feel intuitive and responsive. However, the game is not even the best part. The best part is your friends. A lot of people have complained about the lack of Online multiplayer, but I completely support the developer and long for games that bring back the good old "local multiplayer games" days. AAA games are very sophisticated and everything, but no game (not even TF2!) can give you the fun that you get from having your friends right by your side; Trash talking, High five-ing, howling in frustration and what not. Even writing about this makes me want to play more Towerfall :D\nIt's so great that it has even displaced Fifa 15 as "The game to play" with my friends :D\nTrust me, it may look like I have only a few hours with this game, but I've played this game for nights on end with my friends (offline so it didn't really record it...) and I can assure you we're not going to put this down anytime soon. This definitely is among the greats, even better than the Worms series or anything else that comes to mind at the moment. It's a must buy whether you're just a school-going kid, a college student, or even a total grown up; Because all you need for this game is a bunch of controllers and your best friends! You don't have to put hours into the game because it's really easy to pick up and all the stages are unlockable just by playing versus mode too -- which is a very exciting thing when it happens -- and so you can even sneak in a few rounds during your break (something I do very often :D)\n[Ofcourse, it is best if you hook your laptop up to your TV so that you aren't all crowded around a tiny screen :) ]\nThe Darkfall DLC is also totally worth the price -- It adds a whole lot of powerups to the game and really changes the way you would play it. To end, I can't stress how amazing this game is and how me and my friends spend most of our time talking about Dodge cancelling, or some amazing kill that we had the night before. The only way to truly experience this is to actually play the game, so what are you waiting for? Go get it!","May 21, 2015","true","26.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

For such a small game, it's hard to imagine the developers possibly finding any /more/ ways they could screw it up and render it unplayable.\n\nExpect ear-splittingly loud audio when you first start the game.  Setting volume at 1/10 makes it bearable, but expect a repeat performance every time you come back.  If you're unlucky like me, you won't even be able to play anyway, because the game speed is up by at least an order of magnitude - you won't even be able to navigate the menus.  If you get that fixed, still expect random timing glitches based on whether you have vsync on.\n\nBut those are all bugs, and one presumes that if the developers have any shred of decency or respect for their consumers, they'll at least fix those.  No the real deal-breaker is the controls.\n\nControl mappings are backwards (jump/confirm swapped with shoot/cancel) and can't even be customized.  Countless side-scrollers that have come before have trained us to expect a competent layout that puts your most spammed inputs (movement) closest to the base of the thumb, and conversely your limited use controls further away.  But no, Towerfall went way out of its way to make it as hard as possible not to hit the wrong button /constantly/.  This and this alone renders the game an unplayable exercise in frustration just with the inputs.  The actual gameplay doesn't even factor in.\n\nDon't expect to be able to pick up their slack either.  Mapping controller keys to other controller keys is pretty much impossible or just not worth the exhorbitant effort depending on what hardware you have, and just mapping to keyboard keys won't work either - the game will then read both.\n\nI feel like an incredible sucker for buying this game on two steam accounts before I actually tried it - never even considered it could be this messed up, not when the reviews are so positive and only focus on gameplay and the lack of online play.  This wouldn't pass muster for a PC game in the 90s and would make a sub-par free flash game today.\n\nWhen did developers lose all respect for their customers?  We're humans, not programmable money machines.  Software conforms to us, not the other way around.  To not even bother allowing any way to remap keys - even if the default mapping weren't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ - is just a slap in the face.  I cannot imagine in what world falling short on even this baseline effort could possibly be considered acceptable and worthy of my money.  I want mine back, and barring that, you can at least be sure the developers responsible for this game will never swindle a penny from me ever again.","March 15, 2014","false","0.3"," 70 of 142 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","70","142","2","0"

I've experienced cheap deaths a-plenty, but nothing feels more satesfactory as clearing those tough-as-nails stages on Hardcore mode.\nIf I had to point out one issue I have with it, that would be that co-op's idea of challenge is to swarm you with enemies, up until you fight against the major boss (which I would have liked to see more of.

I can't stand this game.\n\nThe challenge seems to rely on how sloppy the controls are.  That in itself is an immediate turn-off.  The graphics aren't too hot either, but given the recent 8-bit retro style trend in many indie games, I can more or less let that slide.  The sound track was okay.\n\nIt's a multiplayer game which can *only* be played through local co-op/VS mode.  In theory, that shouldn't count negatively for it.  Realistically though, how often do you and your friends have time to get together and play a local co-op game?  For me and my pals that doesn't happen too terribly often, and when it does, we play better games than this.\n\nI got this in a bundle, otherwise I would be pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about the purchase.  It is NOT worth $15.  Maybe if you find it on sale for 75% off and you have easy access to a pal who can join you on a regular basis, then, yes, it's worth the buy.

It's just good fun. The controls are tight and responsive, the mechanics are the perfect blend of "easy to learn, hard to master." Multiplayer is the most fun you can have outside of Smash (and if you ask me it's just the most fun, period), though as part of the "couch multiplayer" revival it features no online mode, so bear that in mind. The art design is spectacular, and just goes to show that pixel art is not only alive and well but more vibrant and beautiful than ever. The score is a mix of crunchy, punchy chiptunes and eclectic orchestral/folk sounds, giving each stage a one-of-a-kind atmosphere. Between the timed Trials and 1-2 player Quest mode, several difficulty levels and insane challenges, crafty unlockable characters, and the aforementioned barrel of fun that is the multiplayer, there's plenty of content to keep you busy; and the latest Dark World expansion only multiplies the replay value. Simply put, this game is firing on all cylinders. Can't recommend it enough, do yourself the favor and play it.","August 23, 2015","true","66.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

One of those games that you can spend hours playing co-op or vs friends (the first one I've truly felt that about since playing super smash bros on friends' couches in middle school).\n\nVery great music and fluid game graphics and mechanics. Overall I am genuinely happy with this purchase and have loved every minute of playing this game. I went through the entire quest mode playing with my girlfriend and she loves it. It's rare that I get a game that she is so happy to play.\n\nThe only negative about this game is that you can't play online. If this game had online multiplayer there would be nothing stopping it from being an absolute hit.  Aside from the lack of online play there is literally nothing to complain about. The expansion introduced a lot of good changes and the quest mode has more character and unique bosses to make it a very enjoyable and pretty difficult experience.

As of right now, it is a sorely needed addition to this game.\n\nPros:\n+ Intense single-player or local play\n+ Great music and pixel art reminiscent of classic 16-bit style\n+ Cute theif\n+ Good variety in enemy types are introduced as you progress\n+ Classic single-screen, wrap-around action like pac-man means you can sneak attack from all sides\n+ Different levels of difficulty are available for the casual or hardcore gamer\n\nCons:\n- 1-hit death, like most games of the genre is a pretty big limitation of how powerful you can feel\n- Limited lives\n- Currently lacking in online connectivity\n\nFinal Verdict:\n8/10 Definitely a good game to own, with a massive DLC add-on that should at least double your playtime, however unfortunately this game is lacking in multiplayer online, requiring you to have this on stand-by as a party game, provided you have enough controllers and friends.","May 13, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I didn't know whether it was the graphics, the floatish movement, or whether it was just a wrong first call, but the trailer did not impress her. I finally convinced her to give it a try - just really quickly and if we won't like it we won't keep playing.\nWe spent the next 40 minutes screaming, laughing, and rocking in our chairs grasping on our controllers due to the emotion. Towerfall is one of those "easy to learn hard to master" games, and man does it execute it well.\nIf you want any local game in your library - let it be this one. If you have someone you game with, they won't be disappointed by this arena shooter brawler.\nWith the amount of variables you can edit, stages you can use, and a quest mode I can already tell that this game will get a lot of play time during the summer and holidays when we both have free.\n\nHighly recommended - great for a laugh and scream fest.","June 5, 2014","true","5.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Ever since, my Ouya has been lovingly referred to as "The Towerfall Box" and, of the dozens of people I've introduced to this game over nearly a year through family gatherings or gaming tournaments or holiday dinners, I've had roughly TWO not like it. It's a great 1v1 game, a fun 3 or 4 player free-for-all, and most importantly my favorite 2v2 game of the last 32 years of my life. And now, with Ascension, it's a fun co-op and single-player diversion when real live people aren't around to stick arrows into.\n\nIf you have even one other person locally that will play this game with you, it's worth the money. If you have a dedicated local gaming group, there's a good chance this will take over your nights of whatever you were playing beforehand.\n\n$15 should not purchase this much fun or value, and yet here we are.

I love discovering the secrets this game has, and I absolutely ADORE the boss fights. (Even if there is only two.) The only problem I may have with this game is multiplayer. This game only allows you to play with your friends locally. The fact that in order to unlock certain levels you HAVE to play multiplayer really limits people who aren't very, eh... social. I had to hook up an Xbox controller on my computer and play with myself just because I wanted to complete the campaign. That being the only problem I had with it, I strongly recommend it. If I had to rate this on a scale of 1-10 I would say 9.75. On a scale of 1-100 I would give it a 95. From A to F I would say A-.

Each round unfolds at a frantic pace, and I was pushed to come up with clever bob and weave tactics that take advantage of the 2D map layout to avoid attacks and return fire.\nThese colorful sprite graphics lend personality to the eight character skins, but are almost painfully primitive and depend on nostalgia for the early days of 2D platformers for appeal. That simplicity makes it especially surprising and fun when a screen-warping visual effect triggers mid-match to set off panicked reactions during battle. My friends often flailed and shouted trying to avoid incoming arrows, creating some of the most hilarious moments.","August 19, 2014","true","11.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The pixel art itself is delicious enough, but the attention to detail in every subtlety (including death animations) and the strong, retro vibe it gives off (even with its unlocks) just add to the overall flavor of delicious.\n\nYou won't need the DLC to get one hell of a good time out of this one, but it's strongly recommended you play with a controller, not because you won't do good with keyboard controls (spoiler, they suck), but because the experience just gets amplified moreso with an analog control setup, which gets even better with multiplayer. Granted it doesn't have online multiplayer (and as such, is restricted to a local co-op/versus mode), it makes up for it by making sure the game is fresh and fun when you DO play it with others.\n\n10/10, would shoot an arrow into infinity and catch it again.","June 5, 2014","true","77.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I didn't know whether it was the graphics, the floatish movement, or whether it was just a wrong first call, but the trailer did not impress her. I finally convinced her to give it a try - just really quickly and if we won't like it we won't keep playing.\nWe spent the next 40 minutes screaming, laughing, and rocking in our chairs grasping on our controllers due to the emotion. Towerfall is one of those "easy to learn hard to master" games, and man does it execute it well.\nIf you want any local game in your library - let it be this one. If you have someone you game with, they won't be disappointed by this arena shooter brawler.\nWith the amount of variables you can edit, stages you can use, and a quest mode I can already tell that this game will get a lot of play time during the summer and holidays when we both have free.\n\nHighly recommended - great for a laugh and scream fest.","June 5, 2014","true","5.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The pixel art itself is delicious enough, but the attention to detail in every subtlety (including death animations) and the strong, retro vibe it gives off (even with its unlocks) just add to the overall flavor of delicious.\n\nYou won't need the DLC to get one hell of a good time out of this one, but it's strongly recommended you play with a controller, not because you won't do good with keyboard controls (spoiler, they suck), but because the experience just gets amplified moreso with an analog control setup, which gets even better with multiplayer. Granted it doesn't have online multiplayer (and as such, is restricted to a local co-op/versus mode), it makes up for it by making sure the game is fresh and fun when you DO play it with others.\n\n10/10, would shoot an arrow into infinity and catch it again.","June 5, 2014","true","77.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

And I don't think I've laughed and screamed at the TV with any game this much outside of Smash. Towerfall is a fast paced brawler/platformer/shooter game. It guess it kind of defies genre classification. I suppose you could file it under party game? It plays best multiplayer, that's for sure.\n\nTowerfall is kind of like Smash, except every hit is a one hit kill. And the levels wrap around Pac-Man style. And every player has projectiles. So I guess not really like Smash then, but it's similarly as fun. It's easy to pick up and play, the only buttons are jump, shoot and dodge. Moving your character around and learning the game is quick and easy, but like any good game, there's a deceptive amount of depth. You don't always want to shoot when your opponent is expecting you to because then he will dodge and catch your arrow. You also don't want to mindlessly fire away arrows at your opponent because ammo is limited and your opponent can pick up any stray arrows that miss and fall on the ground. You also have to be mindful of opponents that get up close to you as jumping on an enemy's head is also a one hit kill.  You also have to be aware of the edges of the screen and remember that the level wraps around. It's possible to get easy kills on unaware opponents by shooting back across the screen at an enemy on the other half of the level or jump down the bottom of the stage to head stomp somebody on top\n\nThere are also powerups that appear throughout the match that can give you arrows that explode on impact, bounce off walls or cut through the stage. Matches are quick, usually averaging about 30 seconds per round, so you'll want to race to pick up powerups as you see them. There are also powerups that can grant you invisibility, flight or trigger arena traps to try to kill your opponents. There's usually a lot happening on screen all at once and matches can get a little hectic, but I mean that in the best way possible. At the end of each round, there's an instant replay system that shows the final kill of the game. This is actually a pretty cool feature because things often happen so quickly that you'll miss how someone died. There's also a good variety of levels that have different powerups, different layouts and different terrain. You can also randomize the rules of Towerfall each round for maximum ridiculousness. One of my favorites was playing under a rule that doesn't show you how many arrows you have left combined with another rule that instantly kills you if you try to fire an arrow when you have no ammo left. The amount of customization and variety in Towerfall is a huge plus\n\nAs stated before, Towerfall definitely plays best with friends. The single player is alright for what it is I suppose, but if you're buying Towerfall, you're getting it to play with other people. Towerfall supports up to 4 simultaneous players and I found that 4 seemed to maximize the fun, hilarity and craziness of the games. Towerfall doesn't support online play of any kind which is really unfortunate because I think a game like this could really be fun online. At the same time though, this game is really fun to share with other people in the same room, yelling, laughing and screaming at the TV and at each other. I wouldn't be surprised to hear that this game eventually gets some sort of online support though, I would imagine that's going to be an often-requested feature. The only other thing that might be limiting this game is the hardware. This game plays best with 4 people. I happen to have 4 USB controllers for my PC, but I'm pretty sure I'm in the minority. And I don't think a whole lot of other people have 4 Ouya controllers or 4 PS4 controllers lying around either.\n\nBut if you've heard the positive buzz about this game, it's true. Believe the hype. This game is well designed, fun and fast paced. It's the early leading candidate for my 2014 game of the year. Yes, I know this technically came out last year on the Ouya. But now it's out on platforms that people actually widely own and use, so I hope this game gets lots of exposure in the near future. Check it out if you want a good, fun party game to share with friends\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","March 30, 2014","true","86.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

No online game play. Can only play locally making it very hard to access and make time to get people together to play.  Poor key binding options.  They recommend you play with only gaming controllers and not use keyboard.  If you try to use the keyboard as a player and controller as another player, key bindings go back to default even after you set them up the way you want them.  So basically if you want to play you have to purchase extra controllers?  Seriously, who is going to buy 3 extra controllers to play this?  The game is already way over priced for what is offered.  If the game was a couple bucks, I'd probably be writing a positive review.   It's a shame because on the surface, the game looks amazing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trojanhorse711/recommended/251470/","trojanhorse711","TrojanHorse711","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trojanhorse711/","80 products in account","This game feels like a mix between Super Smash Bros. (particularly Melee) and the 8-bit Kid Icarus as far as gameplay and singleplayer campaign goes. Each part is more noticable depending on whether you're playing multiplayer or campaign. And, let it be known, this was the game that, alongside Bombsquad, led me to purchasing an Ouya.\n\nIt's upgraded appearance on the PS4 and on Steam are very much welcomed by me, though I have some qualms for the Steam version.\n\nThe PC is, unless you hook it up to the TV, not built for local multiplayer couch parties in mind. Overall, the PC mainly focuses on online multiplayer with the likes of Quake, TF2, and League of Legends. Towerfall does not have online multiplayer, and though arguments have been made supporting its non-support (and I agree with most of them), you essentially have to get things hooked up and working properly to get a decent couch multiplayer experience with Towerfall. Best thing I will say is that the Singleplayer is a bit easier on the PC.\n\nBecause, in my opinion, playing Towerfall with friends on the couch is THE best way to play it, I vastly prefer the Ouya and PS4 versions to the PC version. And, aside from these minor qualms, I think that Towerfall is one of the better combat-platformer (combatformer?) games on the market, outside of Super Smash Bros. itself. If you do not have a PS4 and want to play your PS4 game with friends, Towerfall alone is a solid reason to buy one, though at this point it's somewhat difficult to truly recommend it (hard to say with all these games getting delayed), but if you don't have one and do not intend to buy PS4 or Ouya, get it on Steam. If you have an Ouya, you need Towerfall. If you have a PS4, I will instantly recommend Towerfall Ascension. It's that good of a combatformer game.\n\nPros: VERY Solid gameplay, neat character design (My favorite's the Thief), a unique concept that by all means may be a steep learning curve (1-hit KO on most attacks) but ends up being easy to pick up anyway. Great soundtrack, and interesting take on the pixel art aspect.\n\nCons: If you're not familiar with the game, you may get steamrolled by other experienced players. The music, while still great, can get repetitive in the campaign. PC version is, by design of PC, hard to get that multiplayer experience without online multiplayer built-in (which is why I recommend the PS4 and Ouya versions over the PC version, at least for now). Ouya version was what got me hooked on Towerfall, but last I checked did not get the Ascension version that PS4 and PC had.\n\nOverall: 9.5/10 for PC and Ouya, 10/10 for PS4.","July 18, 2014","true","4.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Technically the keyboard can be used by one player, but it's really awkward. I use Xbox 360 controllers and they're perfect.\n\n* This game really requires friends that you hang out with sometimes. It has no online mode, so you can't play multiplayer when no one else is around.\n\nIf you can swing that, then this game is absolutely amazing. At work, we've just made this game our normal afternoon break.\n\nNote: at first, you may feel like the movement is a little slow. This is because the ability to move very quickly requires somewhat advanced technique, similar to special moves in a fighting game.

It's a game that makes and breaks friendships.\n\nThe movement speed is insane once you become aware of the things that are possible. Catching arrows is one skill, but catching multiple arrows will dodging through the air, ending with sticking to a wall, jumping back into the open area to shoot your opponent with of the arrows you just caught, is simply brilliant.\n\nSure it will take you time to truly master this game, which is best played with an USB controller by the way, but the road to perfection is simply brilliant.\n\nJust like other competitive arena games - take Super Smash Bros as an example - there are several extra power-ups available. These will spawn at the beginning of each match. Some power ups give you special arrows (laser arrows or bomb arrows for example), others will have an environmental influence (slow motion or rising lava). These power-ups are always a great risk to get, because you have to engage, but the reward can be big of course.\n\nOn the other hand there's the tactic to avoid shooting. You start with three or two arrows and when your opponent shoot and miss, you can grab that arrow. But of course, once again, these missed arrows can also be used as a trick. Those are just two examples of how arena control can work in your advantage of disadvantage.\n\nReally, Towerfall Ascension is brilliant and all you need is this baby, four USB controllers, three friends and some drinks for an AWESOME video game evening!","September 27, 2014","true","9.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

After many hours of shooting, jumping and powerups, I can tell you that this is an amazing experience; one I will be playing for many years to come.\n\nThe controls are tight, the options are super robust and the frenetic gameplay is wicked fun. It reminds me of great couch co-op games from the past, Smash Brothers, Power Stone, and WCW Vs. NWO. It brings friends together and tears them apart at the same time. What a wonderful experience.\n\nSome may scoff at the lack of online multiplayer and while that is entirely understandable I also have to say that as the previous owner of a long running internet cafe as well as being a brother among three; I have learned that couch play and LAN play offer a significantly different and in my opinion, a better experience. If online multiplayer is a must for you, I suggest you look at something else for the time being as this is not what you're looking for.\n\nIf you have a couple controllers, some good friends and many hours to spare; you will not regret this purchase.  Towerfall provides endless entertainment in simple 30 second rounds, causing immediate satisfaction and chaos.\n\nHighly suggested purchase.","March 11, 2014","true","6.5"," 20 of 45 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","20","45","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/timmpalainen/recommended/251470/","timmpalainen","T¡m","http://steamcommunity.com/id/timmpalainen/","1242 products in account","This game is my game of the year 2014, without a doubt. Now; I don't know if that is a testament to how brilliant this game is or if it shows how bad 2014 was for PC gaming. Maybe a bit of both.\n\nLet me just state, to begin with; if you plan on just playing this game in singleplayer, then no I would not recommend it.  The Quest-mode, that includes the singplayer portion of the game consists of you facing of against increasningly difficult enemies in arenas similar to the multiplayer, and while it is not bad it is very lackluster and short, and offers little to no replayability. Now, you could play this Quest-mode with a friend and, while it does become a little more interesting, it is still a far cry from the absolute brilliance that the standard multiplayer mode offers.\n\nNow, with that out of the way; let's get into this for real. The meat of TowerFall has always been the mad PvP arena action, and Ascension certainly doesn't fail to fill up to it's predecessors massive boots. No matter if you play a bog standard, vanilla game or some wierd "custom rules"-concoction you will have a blast, just because of how incredible intuitive the game is to just pick up & play. The games only last for about 30 seconds to a minute and the incredible set of rules and factors that you can customize make every game fresh and fun.\n\nNow, this is the real star of the show: the rules and the customizability. Whether you play a "Just one arrow"-game or one where everyone has unlimited bomb-arrows, the game is silly amounts of fun. There is a very big possibility that you can, thru these options; just break the game. And No, I'm not talking breaking as in crashing (like Ubisoft likes to do), I'm talking about the way that you can make this game completely bonkers, with unlimited bomb arrows, levels scrolling at 300MPH and a whole 'nother plethora of options, where you can not even begin to understand what is happening before you're dead and buried. I think think this is evidence on how incredible this game is, if the developers let's you break all the games rules right in the options.\n\nI personally love couch gaming, I don't mind dragging my PC out to my living room for an amazing night of gaming with friends. This is something you would have to learn to love as well, because... Well, there is no online mode. Yes, I know; it is 2014 and a multiplayer game doesn't have online service. Now, I personally prefer local multiplayer for this sort of game anyway, but an online mode would, without a doubt be a nice touch and for a lot of people a necessity.\n\nI love this game, it is brilliant and even though it has massive, glaring holes in it, such as the singleplayer and the lack of an online mode, it shines like a throusand suns just because of the incredible amount of fun it offers in the multiplayer PvP mode.\n\n2014 was a pretty bad year for PC gaming, in my opinion.

It may appear very simple, but it can become extremely challenging very quickly. Here's a video giving you my thoughts on the single-player side of the game (for those of us who have a hard time getting friends over).\n\nhttp://youtu.be/K81IX5qE5JQ\n\nIn summary, here are the pros and cons of the game (some as ? because it varies on the person)\n\n+ Simple controls. It makes it easy for anyone to pick up and play.\n+ High skill ceiling. While moving, shooting, jumping, and dodging are the only controls, using them all in combination to navigate the diverse courses while shooting down foes is more than challenging to say the least.\n+ Fluid gameplay. Everything responds exactly how you expect it to and when you expect it to.\n+ Local Multiplayer is a blast. It's very competitive, and when you win, damn do you feel good.\n+ Highly satisfying when you perform well. It takes a lot of skill to do this, and when you do, you know it.\n+ A lot of enemy variety with different mechanics.\n\n? Extremely challenging. You can make it so difficult, that you will never beat a level unless you perform near perfection. The one-hit-kill system makes this so.\n? Even on normal, it doesn't hold your hand. You will die and fail multiple times before you learn the map's patterns and enemies so you can complete it. The time will differ greatly from person to person.\n? The single player is decent. It's nowhere near as fun as the multiplayer, but that's to be expected of most games.\n\n- No tutorial. The best I could find was something in the options menu that gives you hints, but you have to look for it. With something as difficult as this, anything that helps is greatly appreciated.\n- IMO, I wish they used better quality sprites like the ones they have when you select your character. Just a small ding for this, though. Graphics only matter to a certain extent.\n- This can be very frustrating in later levels. You just can't see everything that's coming at you, and when enemies fill the screen, it only makes it that much worse. Best thing to do is set it down and come back later, but that may be never depending on how bad it ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off.\n- It's local multiplayer only. It cuts off a really good part of the game for those people who can't get people over to play. And I can't help but feel this game would've really benifited from having online servers so you can play multiplayer anytime.\n\nIn conclusion, get it for the multiplayer. You're gonna have a blast with it. If you have time to kill and like a challenge, then consider getting it for the single player. It's not bad for the price.\n\n*Update*\n\nIf you guys wanna see what the Co-op Quest is like, here's another video highlighting the mayhem and hilarity that it brings. To be honest, I think it even makes this game more challenging than doing it alone.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/Pzcb2Lb2Jbw\n\n\n*Final Update*\n\nHere is some of the Versus mode. There is more on our channel if you wish to see it.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/ljLMgculgUI","March 11, 2014","true","5.4"," 26 of 58 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","26","58","0","0"

Overall, the game is extremely well polished. The graphics, sound effects, and game mechanics are outstanding. Multiplayer is really where this game shines. Up to four archers battling for chaotic supremacy. There's different "variations" of gameplay to choose from when playing multiplayer which really help mix it up when the stock gameplay becomes boring.\n\nThe somewhat crappy part about multiplayer though is that you have to unlock new stages and archers by playing the single player (or duo) "quest" mode. This is where things take a downward slope.\n\nThe difficulty is way over the top. Each mob has it's own unique abilities, which is great, but the AI is possibly the worst I've ever seen. Normally when people say "the worst" they mean dumb or too easy. TowerFall is the exact opposite. The AI doesn't really do anything 'on its own', it simply reacts to the user's input. Sure, there's some "dumb" enemies like goos or slugs that walk around the map and occasionally jump at the player but most of the mobs react as soon as the player it's the dodge, jump, or fire action. Like for example the second I press fire, the enemy archer dodges. Every-single-time. Like wise with certain flying mobs. The second I fire an arrow, they dodge. They will always dodge it. Likewise when they fire an arrow. If you dodge, they will fire a second arrow. If you jump, they will reaim and fire another arrow, hitting you everytime. The only way I've found to effectively kill an enemy archer is to unleash a barrage of at least 3 arrows. It's exceptionally stupid.\n\nThat being said, I think this is a really fun multiplayer game. While you have to unlock all the features through single player "quest" mode where you'll have to deal with the abysmal AI, the mutiplayer aspect is s great that I can ignore that.","September 29, 2014","true","97.1"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

If you have friends, get them together and play this game with them. If you don't have friends, go make some and play this game with them.\n\nWhile the game has been critisised for not having online multiplayer, the type of game that it is really doesn't lend itself well to online multiplayer. There is a reason that it's not in, and it is a good reason. The multiplayer really works best when sitting with-and yelling at- the people around you.\n\nThat being said, the single player campaign is also great fun. It's challenging without ever really feeling cheap. While it was put in as a fun little addition to the Ascension version, it's actually very engaging.\n\nThe graphics really are impressive as well. Little details like your character's hat being shot off, or their cloaks being lit on fire after narrowly avoiding an explosion really sell the graphics style. It feels retro, yet very modern.\n\nAnd of course, the soundtrack is excellent as well.","September 27, 2014","true","23.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

It's addictive, very quick and easy to pick up, and is fun to play alone or with up to three other people.\n\nThe initial design and look of the game is surprisingly intricate considering the 2D pixel graphics. The characters have absolutely no difference in combat style or stats, but you still find yourself drawn to them and interpretting personalities purely in the way the sprites move with certain commands. This most definitely also applies to later on when more characters are unlocked. The levels themselves - which randomise every time - also look gorgeous and I'll find myself playing the same couple over and over simply due to how visually interesting they are.\n\nThe combat style comes incredibly naturally. I've seen friends play for both days or only a couple of hours each and still have very good grips on the game, which is handy when it comes to playing versus mode. The stand and shoot style is simple enough and gets the job done, but even after you think you've discovered how to fight in every way possible, there'll be another trick or move you didn't realise existed and it'll add a whole new dimension to combat. It may look simple, but there are countless different strategies and styles of fighting, and that's before the countless types of arrows and pickups come into play - of which there is a strong and interesting variety.\n\nQuest mode, if you power through, can only take a day to complete. This is before completing all the challenges and more difficult settings, so if this is the only mode you're interested in or perhaps have no one to play versus with, it may not be worth the money. However, quest mode can still be done 3x each level if you're aiming for a higher reward each time, which gets many more hours out of the game. Time trials are also possible to explore and present a real challenge; I found them much more difficult than the other modes. But that may simply be because I'm not a fan of time-pressure modes and if you aren't either, this whole section may be pointless for you.\n\nVersus is a huge positive point for this game. It is fun with two people but is definitely more fun with 3-4. Even if you master quest mode, that's usually due to memorising the characteristics and attack patterns of the enemies; which isn't possible in versus. Considering it doesn't take long to get decent at the combat system, it's immediately a fun challenge and fights can go on for literally a couple of seconds or drag out until the time is over. Even though I've completed the game this is definitely a feature I will keep returning to play. This for the most part is what made the game worth my money. The only downside I will note is that it is only local multiplayer, whereas online isn't a feature. You'll have to physically endure your friend's company. Sucks, I know. Another good point to versus, however, is that it's the key to unlocking plenty of achievements both within the game and on Steam, so if you're a completionist you'll be spending plenty of time exploring this mode. There are also lots of variants you can toggle on and off (for example, coming back as ghosts to claim your revenge, which is a great one), which adds a new twist to gaming if you get bored of doing the same thing. This, along with different scoring settings, gives versus a huge variety of options and gameplay styles to experiment with.\n\nAll in all, I'd absolutely recommend this game. If you're more of a casual gamer and can't see yourself pumping that many hours into it, I'd say maybe wait for it to go on sale otherwise you may view it as a bit overpriced. Otherwise, the game has tons of choice and variety, lots of secrets to unlock, and makes you feel like you're an archery master in no time.

A true pixel master slow-roasted these graphics to perfection and it shows in every frame.  Everything is so incredibly individual, it really makes this game stand out in a sea of sadly imagined "pixel-art".  Details like arrows catching fire and archers hats and cloaks being shot off to reveal their little faces can be so easily overlooked in the overall beauty of the environments and the chaos within them.\n\nThe sound is absolutely amazing. The soundtrack is so fitting and the sound effects are so thoughtful and beautifully mastered.  Just hearing the title music gives me goosebumps, and the sound effects are so amazingly original.  The sound really makes the game pop and it really showcases the individuality that this game posseses.  I cannot stress enough how it seems that audio has been put on the backburner in games for so long and almost lost as an art, yet Towerfall is spilling over with so many incredible tracks and sounds.  Not just sounds, but video game stuff.  Stuff that doesn't fit anywhere but on a screen in front of a controller, and it's heaven to my ears.\n\nBeyond just these athstetic properties, the game, although simple, is a masterpiece full of replayability.  As one of many (unlockables!) archers, you can battle against challenging evil NPC creatures alone or with a friend in Quest Mode, or cross arrows with up to 3 other human rivals in the furious Versus Mode.  There's also a Trials section where a single player can race the clock with skillful displays of archery.  As you would expect, the Versus mode is very customizeable, making for many many types of multiplayer battles.  There are currently 75 variants to tweak and the developer has been adding more since release.  And since the game isn't incredibly complex, there's not a lot of room for bugs or glitches to occur.  The game runs flawlessly 100% of the time and doesn't require a massive gaming rig.\n\nThere are some interesting ways that the game lets you unlock new areas and fighters.  Perhaps this one thing was the reason I felt so attached to this game.  Unlocking secrets can be so squeelingly exciteable that it makes this old gamer feel like a kid again.  In an age of DLC and dollar unlockables, this title still has the ability to make a digital unlock feel earned.  Without giving too much information away, one of the final(?) unlockable sequences requires a pretty immersive association with the game, which felt very clever and rewarding.\n\nAlthough, this game may not be for everyone.  The fast-paced mechanics and 'twitch' control style could potentially be a barrier for a lot of inexperienced gamers.  There's no online mode, so if you don't have a lot of couch buddies, the replayability level might not be as high.  The Trials section of the game does offer a heap of challenge though, so if you're only 1p you won't be left out cold.  The keyboard is just no way to play this game though, so you'll need at least one controller to really enjoy it, and if you don't have a set of controllers for a few other players, I'd immagine the fun would be dulled a bit.   That said, if you enjoy a challenge, or challenging your friends, this incredible title will have you and your buddies hooked.\n\nGFX: 10/10\nAUDIO: 10/10\nGAMEPLAY: 10/10","June 20, 2014","true","5.0"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Developed primarily with local multiplayer in mind, it reminds me of playing Goldeneye for the N64 with friends when I was younger. Towerfall makes me wish local multiplayer wasn’t something almost forgotten in today’s industry. If you have the local player-base, the game combines a competitive atmosphere, zany gameplay, and retro graphics to create a great experience.\n\nThe aesthetics of Towerfall are very good. The graphics in the game are done in a modern pixel art style. The sound design applies simple sound effects and a solid soundtrack to ensure the game is appealing from an audio perspective. I think it is a good example of marrying sound, graphics, and style so the sum is greater than the whole. This unification gives Towerfall a unique personality.\n\nThis personality spills into the character and level design. The various archers feel different, despite having no actual gameplay difference or dialogue. I feel each character was given a persona purely by their title and appearance. The levels are well done and provide a good variety of environments. Each level has different layout and graphics. I felt most levels were thematically different and allowed for different strategies to be applied. Enemy design and aesthetics are also cohesive with each level. Some levels contain specific enemies that further drive the theme of each level. Many monsters have unique behavior and weaknesses, making them feel believable and different. There are some enemy re-skins and reuse, but overall the variety is enough.\n\nThere are 3 main modes in Towerfall: quest, multiplayer, and trials. Quest mode is a single player/co-op mode that I found myself primarily playing. In this mode, you go through the various levels of the game defeating waves of monsters. This mode is decent for learning the game and features a “hardcore” difficulty, but I didn’t feel the need to play through it again. Trials mode is similar to the target run in Super Smash Bros. This mode was fun to play through once but like the quest mode, I personally wouldn’t go back. Overall I found the single player modes somewhat boring. I only really found myself playing through the levels to just see the new enemies and gather some unlockables.\n\nThe game is marketed at couch multiplayer and the arena is where the designer’s dream is realized. It allows 2-4 people to test their skills and has a full array of options to modify the game such as changing win conditions, items available, and level variables. There is even a system to give losing or inexperienced players a handicap. The mode is well polished and is something I can see playing on game nights for a long time.\n\nThe actual gameplay is what makes Towerfall great. It is crisp and simple enough for anyone to learn. Characters can simply only shoot arrows, move, jump, and dash. Compounding upon these basic actions, the designer added more features to enhance gameplay. For example, the arrows have slight homing properties. This allows players to not have completely accurate aim(which can be hard with only 8 way aim) but still be competitive. There are also a lot of various power ups. Things like shields, bomb arrows, wings, and drill arrows all work to create dynamic scenarios and open up strategic options. I found myself starting to focus on one type of power up to fit my play style. This all comes together to give a strong sense of flow. I always felt like a badass, dodging two arrows, catching the third, and firing it midair for a kill. Win or lose the gameplay is fast, fun, and furious.\n\nMy praise for the game is overshadowed a bit by some things though. The controls and movement system take a bit of getting used too. I was pretty frustrated until I learned the nuances. As I said above, the single player content is somewhat boring. Maybe leaderboards or something could have helped. This game hinges on being able to play with friends, without others the experience is extremely short. This is a game I’d highly recommend everyone to try out. I’d only warrant a purchase if multiplayer sessions could be set up.\n\nPlay if you:\n- Like games that are easy to learn but hard to master.\n- Reminisce about local gameplay.\n- Want to dive into a theme that is whimsical and fun.\n\nPass if you:\n- Don’t have friends to play the game with.\n- Are tired of the pixel art look in indie games.\n- Prefer games with a story or more developed single player mode.\n\nMy recommendation: Pass. The game is great, but I can’t really recommend buying unless you have the friends to play with.\nScore: 7/10.\n\nFollow me:\n\nTwitter: twitter.com/Tyrrexx\n\nTumblr: tyrrexx.tumblr.com\n\nFollow the developer here: twitter.com/MattThorson","August 31, 2014","true","2.3"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Since each player only has so many arrows at a time... when you run out that's it- you have to either catch one out of the air or "bump" into another player to steal one of theirs. I should mention that this is NOT an easy task as they can just as easily shoot you if you're trying to steal.\n\nThe game's multiplayer however is fantastic- you can customize every match to feature any arrow type, any power up type, or anything else you desire. The two player co-op is also a nice change of pace allowing for you and a teammate to team up and take down hordes of enemies! ... just be careful to not shoot each other...","September 13, 2014","true","5.3"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Towerfall has that "pixel-perfect" movement that makes simply running around and mastering each map a joy. The level of polish present far surpasses that of many other indie games and the inclusion of quest mode makes this release substantially more complete than the OUYA version.\n\nCompared to the recently released Samurai Gunn, I would say that Towerfall offers more complexity and a higher skill cap, not to mention more content and customization. Among my friends Towerfall is already the clear favorite. However even without multiplayer, I have played 5+ hours of singleplayer and still have many more trials and secrets to unlock. If you enjoy classic arcade games and are without nearby gaming friends, I would still highly reccommend purchasing Towerfall. Improving upon times in Trials mode and beating High Scores in Quest Mode offer an endless challenge, while simply clearing all the levels on diamond and hardcore will take most people atleast 8 hours!\n\nThat being said, this game truly shines when you and three of your buddies gather around the same television. With thousands of possible game variants, easy to learn but hard to master gameplay, and short enjoyable rounds I don't see myself playing any other game with my friends for a long time.","March 12, 2014","true","44.1"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Towerfall: Ascension works equally well as a competetive experience and a casual party game--a feat not acheived since, arguably, Super Smash Bros. Melee.\n\nFor the uninitiated: Towerfall: Ascension is a two-dimensional, single-screen, local-only multplayer game in which two to four players attempt to be the last person standing by launching volleys of arrows and squishing heads like an Italian plumber on a small mushroom creature. The mechanics are simple--providing you controls for moving, shooting, jumping, and dodging alone--but offer a level of depth I have barely begun to penetrate.\n\nIf you want to really shake things up, though; Towerfall offers a crazy amount of variants, all of which can be combined in any configuration. Want infinite arrows? Got it. Exploding corpses? Got that, too. Exploding corpses that trigger on command of the deceased? Oh yeah, it's got that.\n\nTowerfall does offer single or multplayer Quest and Trials mode, which are very fun in their own right, and can be crazy addicting if you're looking to master the game, but the real meat and potatoes is in the competitive multplayer. So, if you don't have many friends to play with IRL, or enough controllers to acommodate them, give this one a pass, but if you want to relive the days of your childhood when you had your friends over to play Smash Bros., Goldeneye, MarioKart, et al, you cannot afford to miss this game.\n\nDo I recommend it?

I have yet to have a friend play it who did not instantly fall in love with it. It's mechanics are simple, making it easy for anyone to pick up and immediately have a lot of fun. My friend gifted it to me for my birthday, and that was definitely one of my favorite presents. That afternoon my tiny dorm room was filled with about 8 guys playing and spectating, all yelling and laughing.\n\nThis game is great fun in party settings, but it can also be extremely intense in a 1v1 match. A couple of my friends and I got really good and it started to become a sort of mind game where whoever had the upper hand was the one who could predict what the other player was going to do next. It was crazy.\n\nIf you're a casual gamer or not really a gamer at all, you will love this game for its simplicity, its openness, and the hilarious positions rounds find themselves in. If you are a more serious gamer you will love the tight controls and depth of combat the game provies.\n\nTwo more notes:\n> This game balances extremely well--making it so people who are really good can play with people who are new and everyone will still have a lot of fun.\n> This game is extremely polished. If your arrow flies through a torch, it will catch on fire. If your arrow nicks somebody's head, their hat will fly off and be off for the rest of the game. If the round is in a cold setting, you can see the characters' breath (even if they are invisible). This and more show the care the developers put into every detail. It is phenomenal.

It needs to reward skill, but have an element of luck as well.  It has to allow for incredible comebacks and crushing losses.  TowerFall Ascension does all this and more.  It has quite a retro feel, set up for a 4:3 screen and with SNES-era graphics.  It also has a ton of customizable options, great level variety, a really nice replay set-up for final round kills, works great with Xbox 360 controllers... I could go on and on, but I won't.\n\nThis game has that "thing" that makes you say "one more round..." about 30 times before you actually turn it off.\n\nThere are two drawbacks that came immediately to mind.\n\nOne, couch multiplayer only.  Not a problem if you have friends, controllers, and your PC is set up for gaming.  Not great if you typically play games at a desk on a monitor.  This isn't much of a single player game, so this is going to limit its audience, which is really unfortunate.\n\nTwo, per the store page, minimum specs for integrated GPU solutions call for Intel HD 4400, which I believe starts with 2013 Haswell chips.  I don't really get that at all.  Intel HD 4000 is able to run The Darkness II or Bulletstorm on medium settings at 720p at 30FPS.  How on earth this game would be so poorly optimized as to not run on that chipset is beyond me.  Note that in fairness, I haven't actually tried it yet, so who knows, it may run.  I just find it bizarre.  As a comparison, games in a somewhat similar space like Nidhogg and Samurai Gunn run flawlessly on an Intel HD 4000 chipset.\n\nEDIT:  Haven't tested multiplayer yet but the quest campaign mode ran flawlessly on my Surface Pro.  Inten HD 4000 probably runs this game fine.\n\nOutside of that, I'd give this game my strongest possible recommendation.  It is an instant couch multiplayer classic like Mario Kart, Smash Brothers, Rock Band, etc.","March 22, 2014","true","4.6"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

Then I got 3 friends over and boy was I wrong!\n\nThe pace can be frantic and down right insane at times. Trying to take out one opponent when another is hot on your tail can make for some intense matches. Nothing can beat the yelling that goes on when one person misses with an arrow only to be taken out by the person they were attacking. Or watching a one-on-one match from the sidelines and shouting for who you want to win.\n\nThe variety in this game is truely astounding, and frankly, something I wasn't expecting. The variants you can add to the match (such as laser arrows that never go away until they hit a person or another arrow, or corpses that can explode on command) really add a layer of depth that a game like this benefits from. The fact that you can save up to three pre-set variation packs makes these options work extremely well. So you don't have to go into the variants menu every time and select each modifier one-by-one, you can just save your favorite to a pre-set and reload it whenever you want to use it. The group I play with use this every time we play and it is wonderful.\n\nThe single player (Quest Mode) starts off more slow-paced than its multiplayer conuterpart, but does not stay there for long. The boss fights (yes, there are boss fights) take on a whole new level of gameplay and test your skills learned thusfar. The ability to play the "Quest Mode" with a second player really helps on  the more difficult matches, and I was only able to defeat the last level with a friend helping me. It really is a value add for something that could have been a multiplayer only experience.\n\nThe trials were something I never really got into. I'm sure they are fine, but I'm not a big fan of trying to speedrun stuff like that so I can't speak much on it.\n\nLastly, the hidden unlockable characters add a nice incentive to try the other game modes. There are four characters and I believe the same number of levels that can be unlocked in various ways. Each character has their own unique look. I would highly suggest getting all of these, as they are not too difficult to find and unlock.\n\nAll in all, this game is insanely good. Fast paced, frantic, screamingly good fun for a group of friends. Highly reccomended!","July 26, 2014","true","42.9"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

If you don't have a controller: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It's painfully difficult and you need a controller and an extra friend to unlock all of the extra characters in the game, all the levels. Otherwise it is a fantastic game, and A LOT of fun. Although, I don't have a controller, i still managed to do everything I could do, from unlocking a secret level to playing all the trial modes, but I felt robbed of what could've been a truly great experience. Without a controller, the controls are fairly awkward and take ALOT of getting used to, you can't change them, and again, you don't get the entire game/Towerfall experience since 99% of the games unlockables REQUIRE someone to play with you, and if you don't have a controller then it is impossible to get your full enjoyment and dare I say it, money's worth. With a controller, 10/10. Without a controller 7 or 6 out of 10, due to how well you can deal with the awkward controls and the difficulty. (The awkward controls adding to the difficulty.)","May 27, 2014","true","7.7"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

When opponents aren’t around, the quest mode and trails are incredibly difficult but just as satisfying. The continuous updates show that the dev cares about making this game even better. With added Mac and Linux support (that I have not tested yet), its over the top awesome. I strongly recommend this to anyone interested.\n\nTwo important caveats. First, it is a versus game at its core and offline only. If you aren't ever going to be playing couch co-op with friend or at LAN parties, you lose a lot of the value. Even just one v one is super fun. You can keep it interesting for a long time with all the different varients. Second, controllers are basically necessary. I use the 360 controller, and it works great without having to messing around with any settings. You can use others as far as I know.\n\nThis awesome game has many other cool features I didn't meantion, like cloud saves.

The game is balanced to as near perfection as anything could be, and every second is a tense, rewarding struggle. Except maybe for that time I accidentally flung my skull right under a guy's boot.

There's so many ways to approach how you put an arrow in your friend's head. This game is uproarious fun -- and I mean that literally. My friends and I have literally been brought to cacophony because our epic battle was like two fireflies dancing in the sky... firing arrows at each other.\n\nIf you have friends, controllers, and flinch when someone says "that game's new?

I've only played 2-player, but I can definitely imagine the fun with more players. While there are singleplayer and co-op modes, the game's main focus is a Versus mode in which all players start on a single-screen arena with a bow, and about 3 arrows. You can shoot them at the other players, which follows some gravity, and occasionally has a slight homing effect to allow for impressive long shots. You can also simply choose to jump on the other player, often ending up the easier choice. Finally, there's a Dodge ability you can use to get away from an explosion, or even to catch arrows. One shot or stomp is all it takes, and when only one player is alive, a round is over and you move on to the next one.\n\nThe game offers you other arrow types mid-match, like laser arrows, bomb arrows, bramble arrows, etc. While there's always a little more to learn, it's easy for a new player to pick up the basics.","June 15, 2014","true","26.3"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

It seems simple, at first, pulling off that easy to learn, hard to master feel PERFECTLY. But despite that simplistic feel, new mechanics and concepts are CONSTANTLY being funneled in. I didn't even know there were unlockable characters until I looked at the steam achievements! And I know my playtime is a little short, but thats just because of how fast and manic the gameplay is. Theres 3 main modes; Trials, Co-op, and most importantly, versus. In trials, you shoot out all the stationary targets in a stage as fast as you can for a medal. Its fun, if you're into that sort of thing. In Co-op (which can be played single player), you take on increasingly difficult waves of enemies in a stage, with a very small amount of arrows at your disposal. You start with only 3, and unless you catch an enemy archers arrow or get new ones from a chest, you'll have to chase them down and pull them out of walls, corpses, or whatever they get stuck in. And then, theres versus... oh geez. SO. You and up to three friends (only locally) go toe to toe in the arena. Thats pretty much it. Theres a huge variety of levels and layouts, some with difficult areas to get around, some with explodable walls, some with traps, some with moving platforms... theres a good variety. And on top of that, theres a ton of variants to toggle, like slow-mo, infinite arrows, infinite alt. arrows, rechargeable shields, scrolling levels, etc. etc. It sounds kinda simple, but then you take into account the 2 game mechanics that make EVERYTHING deeper!\n1. The arrows- on top of the small amount of arrows you'll have at once, theres a ton of different ones! some will coat the arrows around where they land with spikes, some will explode, some will dart in different directions to easily home in on a target, some drill through terrain, some will explode in a t-shape like in bomberman... and they all home ever so slightly towards enemies. Or you can just jump on their heads.\n\n2. The dash- You have a dash that you can perform in any direction. It doesn't move you super far, but it has a lot of uses! It can make you clear a short distance really quickly, so its good for dodging in a pinch. You can also dodge downwards to jump on someones head EVEN FASTER. BUT WAIT THERES MORE. You can dodge INTO incoming arrows to CATCH THEM AND TAKE THEM FOR YOURSELF. That fact right that there makes the game like forty times more intense. You can shoot arrows back and forth at friends, and the arrows can collide in mid-air, and then  you can race to see who gets the precious ammo first, or you can catch them in mid air and fire their own arrows right back at them! COmbined with the dash's brief, couple second cooldown, you'll have to constantly decide whether to dodge into arrows to catch them, or dodge away if two many are coming at you at once.\n\nMatchs in towerfall are all instinct and reaction time. And its onw of those games that'll become deeper and deeper as you keep playing it and learning the mechanics! Its an amazing game, and its great multiplayer fun! Pick it up, especially if its on sale! And if you like it, dark world just adds even more!\n\nAll in all, 9/10! I can confirm that Matt does indeed make games!","December 14, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is not good on a Keyboard, the bindings are awful and don't seem to be changeable. However If you own a controller you should be fine. Even more so if you have a Steam Controller, as I have just spent about 15 - 20 mins configuring mine for the game, and it works a dream now.\nThe game itself is so addictive in multiplayer, so much fun. Single Player is more of a getting used to the buttons and maps affair rather than a real game, but multiplayer is what this game is aimed at, and how it should be played.\nLooking forward to dipping in to the Workshop for new levels etc as time goes on to.","November 13, 2015","true","40.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can hop on people's heads and kill them instantly. The end\n\nMultiplayer is VERY fun, and it's up to four players as well. I'd recommend getting three of your closest friends (Or your siblings) and playing a round or two of this just... Because I guess.\n\nGameplay is hard to explain but who cares, watch some gameplay of it to get a feel of it.\n\nVery fun multiplayer game, I'd say wait for it to be on sale before picking it up as 15 dollars is a bit much, I got my copy for 3 dollars.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/251470/","November 1, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can hop on people's heads and kill them instantly. The end\n\nMultiplayer is VERY fun, and it's up to four players as well. I'd recommend getting three of your closest friends (Or your siblings) and playing a round or two of this just... Because I guess.\n\nGameplay is hard to explain but who cares, watch some gameplay of it to get a feel of it.\n\nVery fun multiplayer game, I'd say wait for it to be on sale before picking it up as 15 dollars is a bit much, I got my copy for 3 dollars.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/251470/","November 1, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a fast unforgiving game playable in small bites (another retry is only a few minutes more, and the success is very satisfying).\n\nThe local "versus mode" is even better. You need to make split second decisions, and at some point, you're guaranteed to make some hilarious blunder and find yourself pinned to the wall with all your opponent's arrows through your body. But then, you can take your revenge during the next round.\n\nRecommended for big fun in small bites, especially if you've got two controllers and two players on a regular basis...","September 24, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmsdomain/recommended/251470/","dmsdomain","Sir Casm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmsdomain/","372 products in account","Tl;dr: Towerfall is one of the best local multiplayer games ever made.\n\nThe one thing that stands out about Towerfall is how it utilizes simplicity to an amazing extent - basing the whole game on one simple mechanic of shooting arrows. Sure, different arrows and other powerups keep it fresh, but the core design is so strong - playing without any powerups in a simple map doesn't get boring after the 5000th round. Adding to the variety are the modifiers in Versus mode, which just adds to the number of hilarious deaths.\n\nBut make no mistake - multiplayer is very competitive with the *right* opponents (and this is one reason which may put off people - there is no online multiplayer). The game is a good example of easy to get into, hard to master. I'm fortunate enough to have friends who're also into this game, so I've had some pretty tough competition to level up.\n\nThe Quests are where Towerfall is at its weakest, but the weakest sections are still pretty strong. The game technically isn't long - if you're good at the game it'll barely take you 4 minutes per level to beat it in Normal without retries. The length, however, comes from the retries. But really, the feeling of beating Ascension in Hardcore mode after the 400th try is priceless.\n\nI'm a bit conflicted about the Dark World expansion though. It's definitely a good expansion, adding 4 new characters and (effectively) 4 single player quests with a restructuring of how quests are played (different arenas as opposed to different rounds in the same arena in the original) - but I'm not sure whether that justifies the price. Multiplayer is almost the same, just with more maps and characters (and since there are no character-specific abilities, that doesn't mean much).\n\nSo yeah, main game - must buy. Expansion - should buy.","December 30, 2015","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seems simple, at first, pulling off that easy to learn, hard to master feel PERFECTLY. But despite that simplistic feel, new mechanics and concepts are CONSTANTLY being funneled in. I didn't even know there were unlockable characters until I looked at the steam achievements! And I know my playtime is a little short, but thats just because of how fast and manic the gameplay is. Theres 3 main modes; Trials, Co-op, and most importantly, versus. In trials, you shoot out all the stationary targets in a stage as fast as you can for a medal. Its fun, if you're into that sort of thing. In Co-op (which can be played single player), you take on increasingly difficult waves of enemies in a stage, with a very small amount of arrows at your disposal. You start with only 3, and unless you catch an enemy archers arrow or get new ones from a chest, you'll have to chase them down and pull them out of walls, corpses, or whatever they get stuck in. And then, theres versus... oh geez. SO. You and up to three friends (only locally) go toe to toe in the arena. Thats pretty much it. Theres a huge variety of levels and layouts, some with difficult areas to get around, some with explodable walls, some with traps, some with moving platforms... theres a good variety. And on top of that, theres a ton of variants to toggle, like slow-mo, infinite arrows, infinite alt. arrows, rechargeable shields, scrolling levels, etc. etc. It sounds kinda simple, but then you take into account the 2 game mechanics that make EVERYTHING deeper!\n1. The arrows- on top of the small amount of arrows you'll have at once, theres a ton of different ones! some will coat the arrows around where they land with spikes, some will explode, some will dart in different directions to easily home in on a target, some drill through terrain, some will explode in a t-shape like in bomberman... and they all home ever so slightly towards enemies. Or you can just jump on their heads.\n\n2. The dash- You have a dash that you can perform in any direction. It doesn't move you super far, but it has a lot of uses! It can make you clear a short distance really quickly, so its good for dodging in a pinch. You can also dodge downwards to jump on someones head EVEN FASTER. BUT WAIT THERES MORE. You can dodge INTO incoming arrows to CATCH THEM AND TAKE THEM FOR YOURSELF. That fact right that there makes the game like forty times more intense. You can shoot arrows back and forth at friends, and the arrows can collide in mid-air, and then  you can race to see who gets the precious ammo first, or you can catch them in mid air and fire their own arrows right back at them! COmbined with the dash's brief, couple second cooldown, you'll have to constantly decide whether to dodge into arrows to catch them, or dodge away if two many are coming at you at once.\n\nMatchs in towerfall are all instinct and reaction time. And its onw of those games that'll become deeper and deeper as you keep playing it and learning the mechanics! Its an amazing game, and its great multiplayer fun! Pick it up, especially if its on sale! And if you like it, dark world just adds even more!\n\nAll in all, 9/10!

Yea sure it lacks online multiplayer, but since my girlfriend and i can play this together locally, we never missed the online functionality, which similar games like "Duck Game" have to offer. In Towerfall however you got fast-paced hilarious multiplayeraction, which is easy to pick up. So when friends drop by we often play it together, they love it too, and since it is so chaotic and the mechanics are very basic, they end up having tons of fun, even though they might not be as experieced in the game than us two. I think the problem with those multiplayer games is often that there is a huge skill gap between new players and experienced ones, but since towerfall feels totally different when played as two or as four, this problem does not exisst here... Still one might hope they patch in online functionality one day.\nBtw pick up the dlc too, its great!","December 28, 2015","true","60.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmsdomain/recommended/251470/","dmsdomain","Sir Casm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmsdomain/","372 products in account","Tl;dr: Towerfall is one of the best local multiplayer games ever made.\n\nThe one thing that stands out about Towerfall is how it utilizes simplicity to an amazing extent - basing the whole game on one simple mechanic of shooting arrows. Sure, different arrows and other powerups keep it fresh, but the core design is so strong - playing without any powerups in a simple map doesn't get boring after the 5000th round. Adding to the variety are the modifiers in Versus mode, which just adds to the number of hilarious deaths.\n\nBut make no mistake - multiplayer is very competitive with the *right* opponents (and this is one reason which may put off people - there is no online multiplayer). The game is a good example of easy to get into, hard to master. I'm fortunate enough to have friends who're also into this game, so I've had some pretty tough competition to level up.\n\nThe Quests are where Towerfall is at its weakest, but the weakest sections are still pretty strong. The game technically isn't long - if you're good at the game it'll barely take you 4 minutes per level to beat it in Normal without retries. The length, however, comes from the retries. But really, the feeling of beating Ascension in Hardcore mode after the 400th try is priceless.\n\nI'm a bit conflicted about the Dark World expansion though. It's definitely a good expansion, adding 4 new characters and (effectively) 4 single player quests with a restructuring of how quests are played (different arenas as opposed to different rounds in the same arena in the original) - but I'm not sure whether that justifies the price. Multiplayer is almost the same, just with more maps and characters (and since there are no character-specific abilities, that doesn't mean much).\n\nSo yeah, main game - must buy. Expansion - should buy.","December 30, 2015","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealniro/recommended/251470/","therealniro","Hey, that's mildly adequate.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealniro/","85 products in account","To be honest, this game would be SO much better if id had online multiplayer. Also I'd really love to see an update, where i can finally customise my controls on my controller. Since it isn't a ps or xbox controller, it can be really annoying when I'm used to 1 button as 'shoot' but then I press it, and it's 'jump' instead. I think it makes a lot of players uncomfortable.\n\nOther than that, it is a really great and fun game if you have some friends to come over and play it.\n\nDo I recommend it? If it's on a sale, yes.","March 2","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
