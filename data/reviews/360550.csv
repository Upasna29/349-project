The  backgrounds  are beautiful and detailed using a mix of color tones to depict the mood of the scene.\n\nTo sum up i would definitely recommend it to fans of visual novels and for those who want to try somethwing new or have a change in pace of visual novel.\n\nIn short do not give this visual novel a miss.\n\nClick here for the full review![azusantiara.wordpress.com]","August 3, 2015","true","9.0"," 72 of 79 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","72","79","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jfietkau/recommended/360550/","jfietkau","jfietkau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jfietkau/","6646 products in account","The fundamental question behind the concept of fate is as old as storytelling itself. Do we truly forge our own path through the causality of the universe, or are we beholden to some kind of unknowable higher order? And if the universe is set on a specific course, maybe someone can steer it?\n\nCursed Sight is a visual novel developed and written by InvertMouse, it was released in August 2015 following a successful Kickstarter campaign earlier the same year. It's 45000 words long with four different endings and took me a bit more than three hours for 100% completion.\n\nThe story is set in a fictional medieval far-east-inspired nation where a select few people are born with the gift (or curse, depending on how you look at it) of fate magic. One of the central characters, a young girl named Miyon, can influence the tides of fate in her nation's favor, but everyone who looks into her eyes is fated to die within the week. Enter the protagonist of the story, Gai, a young boy sold into slavery by his parents. He gets assigned to do various household chores in the temple where Miyon is held.\n\nFirst things first: I really liked this VN and I have no regrets at all about reading it. It has high-quality artwork and a fitting soundtrack – neither is deeply unique or special compared to other VNs, but they go together well to form a very cohesive whole, and I have to appreciate an inspired color scheme and visual design when I see one. It packs everything you'd expect from a modern VN, including auto and skip modes as well as copious amounts of save slots. As always, the multiplatform support is something that I personally greatly appreciate.\n\nThe story is an interesting beast, the premise sounds generic enough at first but the plot does itself a huge favor by avoiding romance-themed routes and most of the clichés that typically come with them, focusing on action and drama instead. The plot is beautifully rich and engaging, the events of the story could easily fill out twice or thrice the word count, and if there is one otherwise common problem that Cursed Sight deftly avoids, it's boredom. The introduction is short and sweet, the conflict comes swiftly, and there was never any moment where I felt like I wanted to stop reading.\n\nRegrettably, the riptide of dramatic events is also the biggest problem I had with Cursed Sight. It has been said that a story needs a rhythm, an ebb and flow, to not push its readers away. If there's one thing for me that would have turned my somewhat shaky recommendation into a firmer one, it would have been a whole lot more ebb. Even though the story only features one explicit time skip, it feels like too much character development happens off screen. To its credit, the novel still manages to make the gradual change of Gai's and Miyon's interactions from mutual dislike to close companionship pretty believable, but if it had had more slice-of-life segments where the characters just simply talk to one another, learn about each other and clarify who they are and where they stand on various issues, I think that would have worked wonders to sell me more forcefully on the relationships portrayed in the dramatic scenes. Additionally, a minority of the endings also seemed unduly rushed.\n\nI'm not sure whether I can put my finger on all of Cursed Sight's strengths, and it's hard to summarize what a new reader should expect from the story. Romance is hinted at, but not really explored. Political intrigue is also hinted at, but not really explored either. The worldbuilding is colorful and imaginative, but too coarse to really be able to make up your own stories in the setting. But perhaps the most glaring issue I had was with the weird colloquialisms and anachronisms sprinkled throughout the script (the worst offender: a quip about chainsaws) that are probably intended to be charming, but just come across as out of place.\n\nI'm doing a pretty terrible job recommending a VN I liked, aren't I?\n\nLet's loop back to something I liked about the story: I like being surprised (I have a bit of a soft spot for genre subversions), and a very positive surprise I got from Cursed Sight was the way it handles its main characters.\n\nWith many stories you get the impression that the setting shapes itself around the protagonist, hiding all sorts of plot conveniences just well enough to fool most casual readers, and in the end everyone gets what they deserve because that's how stories tend to work. Gai starts out in a position of complete and utter helplessness (and in hindsight the start of the VN does a great job at portraying the mindset of a ten year old boy who just had the belief strongly reinforced that, in the grand scheme of things, nothing he values is safe and nothing he does matters), and you'd expect a "hero's journey" style rise to glory as he overcomes his inner demons. But then that doesn't happen at all, Gai and Miyon simply keep being normal people with normal issues, tossed here and there by circumstance like plastic bags in the wind, and when you reach your first ending, chances are you won't find it satisfyingly fulfilling but rather just depressingly plausible. It seems that for someone imbued with fate magic, Miyon has tragically little control over her own fate – a bittersweet irony and one of the literary masterstrokes that make me like Cursed Sight as much as I do.\n\nI'd love to go into more detail here, but more than that I want to give you the chance to read Cursed Sight spoiler-free. There's certainly enough in there to be worth a read, and unless you dislike fantasy as a genre (or you think that every fantasy protagonist needs to follow the "hero's journey" and be virtuous and just at all times), you probably won't be disappointed.","December 20, 2015","true","6.9"," 34 of 35 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","34","35","4","2"

It explores levels of emotion and ties between people that is rarely explored by devs, VN authors or anything at all, the reason for this is that its easy to mess up when going into these sorts of topics, i cant say what they are because they are spoilers.\n\nSo Cursed Sight is a bit janky at the start, you may or may not be annoyed as the protagonist starts as a 10 year old, as you can imagine the life of a 10 year old is simple, we dont have much experience and we are a bit immature and indecisive at that age and that is reflected rather well. Pacing issues crop up a lot at the start, mainly for the first thirty minutes while they try and set the foundations down, this is the maining area of improvement id say because its very short, three hours to finish all endings is very short and the longer you know the charecters the more impacting the endings will be.\n\nOn the topic of the endings ill say that two are out right stunning, in a good way. Its because the author can string so many emotions into a set of around 500 words and it can be interpreted in so many ways, its the kind of ending that will be left lingering in your head for weeks as you try to fully compile the various effects and outcomes.\n\nThat is where this game indirectly elevates itself from a standard issue VN to a masterpiece, you oddly get many hours out of this because of how much you think about it outside of the game, while its short it somehow becomes longer after its finished.\n\nMany animes and VNs have tried to do something like this, we are talking about stuff like Clannad or From the New World.\n\nOn the other parts the artstyle and the general artwork is very good and the interface works as it should. The music fits the scenarios very well but its not too memoriable.\n\nIn the VN market this is 100% a sleeper hit. I look forward to the future works from this dev because they have set the bar very high for themselves now.\n\nThe one and only thing that i can say is just make it longer to get rid of that sense of it feeling rushed.","August 7, 2015","true","3.4"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","28","33","0","0"

He is then assigned the Duty of taking care of the needs of a Girl named Miyon who has the "Cursed Sight" This gives her the power to perform rituals that can alter Fate and various scenarios the Regions ruler may desire.\n\nOnto the Technical Side of things\n\nAudio - The soundtrack is very suiting for both the situations and environments it is used in, it is certainly nice to listen to and really helps add to the experience when it gets to more intense story parts. The Audio REALLY complements these well!\n\nVisual - The backgrounds are all pretty and certainly help you imagine the way the area is designed to be. The characters are also wonderfully drawn and to the standard that many VN fans would enjoy, the art takes a very good approach in being pretty and sometimes cute, but also feeling very powerful and succeeds in conveying character emotion when it needs to.\n\nTo summarise - This Novel is certainly worth a read in many ways, Your getting a great reading experience with 4 different endings (the true extra ones the best : P). You'd be supporting an awesome Indie Dev who absolutely deserves positive attention. And lastly, it's not that expensive either, your certainly getting Your monies worth! I can say I enjoyed this Novel a lot and will now be proceeding to buy the Digital Artbook and the Original Soundtrack!\n\nAnd Lastly, Thanks to InvertMouse for this wonderful story : D","August 3, 2015","true","3.9"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

However by the end of it my opinion is completely changed. The story is unique, in a historical oriental style; it tells a great tale of adventure, drama and romance.. The length is modest, I managed to finish it entirely within less than 3 hours. And in those 3 hours it has given me a final ending which I would remember for a good 3 months or so.. Truthfully speaking, achieving the final ending requires you to play throughout the other 3 endings first, and these endings aren't all particularly pleasant.. HOWEVER they do add to the final effect of relief and bliss which the finale gives so yes they are crucial, don't skip them. The plot development was nice, overall it was a solid story. I wouldn't say it to be too good if it weren't for the feeling that reading EVERY ending will give you. The story telling style however is in a modern style, which may make it feel out of place but for me personally it made things more enjoyable.The art is one of the best I've seen in a visual novel, vivid and vibrant colors affecting the mood and tone of things. I cannot say the same for the music however, sweet-sounding it is it does seem kind of out place at times.\nOverall, this visual novel is something to keep you occupied for a short amount time. It is very friendly to first timers and tells a great story. I am not saying that it is an extremely good story, but overall with its endings and final ending, it is a conclusive, well-written and enjoyable legend.. (or feels trip if you see it that way)\n\nI would rate it an 8.7/10, great score for a great game.","December 23, 2015","true","3.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

It's well worth the money on full price.\n\nThe novel definitely did a great job in putting weight on the choices, as one choice would lead to a drastically different outcome from the rest.

Aside from the three default endings, I think the true ending was definitely the best possible resolution to the story.\n\nI look forward to more visual novels from InvertMouse in the future, because Cursed Sight definitely marked its name on one of my favorite visual novels, mainly because of my attachment to the characters, their backstories, and the realistic portrayal of conflicts between two nations. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to immerse in a story with memorable characters and a superb storyline.","August 6, 2015","true","4.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

That aside, onto pros and cons.\n\nPro's\n+The character design was pretty good.\n+Miyon is a very endearing character, IMO.\n+The overall story was good, but I had a few qualms I have with specific scenes.\n+The characters are generally likeable.\n+The endings, again aside from a minor qualm with a specific scene, are very good.\n+It is clean, no echhi at all. This may be a con for you.\n\nCons\n-Gai uses a lot of modern slang, objects, and imagery in his thoughts and dialogue, it can be a bit jarring given the setting and one of the endings highlights how out of place it is.\n-Gai will often crack jokes at the worst times possible, this could ruin immersion in a few scenes, the most notable in particular (ENDING SPOILER) when  he thinks some wisecrack about a guard, then we see a tortured Miyon begging him to kill her.\n-I found myself disagreeing with how a couple of the endings played out, but that is a minor qualm because my disagreement could be in the minority.\n-It is too short for me, taking only about 3 hours to get all the endings. That may not be a con to you.\n-It is clean, no echhi at all. This may be a pro for you, as it is for me.\n\n\nAll this aside, had the last visual novel I read not been eden*, I would probably have fallen madly in love with this one, as it stands, I merely enjoyed it greatly.","August 9, 2015","true","3.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Once I was done I simply HAD to buy the full thing. This sort of story has been told before but I really enjoy the way it played out in this VN. The art is very nice, and some of the characters are very interesting. Unfortunately I think the pacing is a bit rushed, and some characters that were beginning to become interesting didn't get a full opportunity to shine. However, the story was still very enjoyable. I will admit that I shed a few tears at the true ending. The soundtrack is very nice, though I think some of the loops were perhaps too short or noticeable. All in all it's a very nice story, I just wish it had been longer. It was a delicious meal that I wasn't able to savour. That being said, with the low price it's definitely still worth it if you're into stories of tragic love and self-sacrifice, especially through the format of a beautiful visual novel.","August 6, 2015","true","2.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This does not make it a bad game, however. It’s actually a great game. It’s a visual novel with only two opportunities to make choices and four endings so most of the time is spent reading. I put the game on auto and read it while eating dinner, it was very relaxing; a digital book with gorgeous artwork.\n\nThe story is about Gai, a young boy from West Taria whose parents have just sold him into slavery to the neighboring kingdom of East Taria. He begins working at the grand temple and soon meets Miyon, the girl with the aforementioned cursed sight. With the ability to predict the future and sometimes change it, Miyon has lived a sheltered life as the kingdom’s treasure and works for the king. You also meet Sasa, a local dancer and friend to Miyon who soon take you under her wing and acts as a surrogate mother to you and the young Miyon. The story advances ten years and war breaks out between the two lands of Taria. What happens next is a series of life-changing events for Gai and Miyon as well as the kingdoms.\n\nAlong with this gripping story about life, loss and self discovery is beautifully done artwork filled with vibrant colors and emotions. Each smile and frown on the characters help drive the story along and pull you even more as the incredibly well written story captivates you. The music in Cursed Sight adds the finishing touch in the immersion as you follow along on the characters’ journeys.\n\nI highly recommend buying Cursed Sight if you enjoy visual novels. The game may take very sad turns but it’s a testament to how well-written the game is that it jerks your emotions around and even after finishing the game leave you speechless. I was very moved by this game and believe that you will be as well.\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]","January 2","true","4.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Being a slave to a eccentric, somewhat abusive girl who can change fate and can kill you by simply looking at you with her eyes might be an even worse option. That is the predicament Gai, a ten-year-old boy, finds himself in after being sold by his West Tarian family to a temple in East Taria. Gai quickly realizes how bad his situation is when the girl in question is referred to as “The Treasure of the Nation.”\n\nCursed Sight, from developer InvertMouse opens with a quick introduction to Gai, and the temple in East Taria where he will be serving “The Treasure of the Nation,” named Miyon. Miyon possesses an ability known as the Cursed Sight. It gives her the power to affect the future, at the cost of her energy, which is of great use to King Lok, the king of East Taria. It also causes anyone who makes eye contact with her eyes  to die. For that reason, she must always wear a veil over her eyes, to protect those around her. On top of all of that, she is also about ten years old, the same age as Gai, and extremely stubborn. Needless to say, the two children don’t get along very well, which is problematic for Gai who could very well be executed if he displeases Miyon to the point that it angers the King Lok.\n\nGai is a treat of a character. At the start of the story, he is only ten years old, and is written as such. He whines, and complains, and gets flustered and embarrassed. Sometimes he acts selfish, and lets his anger get the better of him. Miyon is the same way, and acts as one would expect a ten-year-old girl who is used to only ordering slaves around to act. Now, it wouldn’t be much fun to read about two kids fighting all the time. I could just go visit my younger sisters if I wanted to see that. This is where Sasa plays a huge role. Being older than Gai and Miyon, she acts as a motherly figure to the two, stopping their fighting, making them talk to each other, and just being there for the both of them when times are tough. She is the perfect counter-weight to the two children, and Gai’s crush on her is so childlike, it reminds me of my childhood crushes.\n\nThe first half of the VN allow us to get to know the characters very well. The days flow by naturally, with no explicitly stated time progression which allows Cursed Sight to avoid the rapid, sudden character development scenes that plague many VNs (A sudden development to a character that happens in an unrealistic amount of time is what I am referring to. The main example of this is the protagonist and female falling in love over the course of a week in a common route). The story, after building the characters up in a methodical manner, starts moving forward in the second half of the VN. King Lok declares war on West Taria and begins using Miyon’s powers to his benefit. This begins to take a toll on Miyon, tiring her out more easily, and even worse for her well-being and safety, her powers begin declining. Gai, now willingly helping Miyon with Sasa’s encouragement is extremely worried about her, and begins looking for ways to help her.\n\nThe story, especially in the second half, is powerful, but still does not ignore the characters, keeping the fun, enjoyable character interaction that I came to love in the first half of the VN. Despite that, things do get pretty heavy later on, and the choices that you must make can be difficult. It is absolutely worth getting every ending though, as care and effort was put into each one. The true ending is phenomenal and easily one of the best endings to any OELVN I have read.\n\nThe art of Cursed Sight is very high quality, and professional. The backgrounds are vibrant, and the characters show so much personality through the art. When a character smiles, their happiness shows. It isn’t simply a drawn smile, its a facial expression of happiness (which is even more impressive for Miyon whose face we only ever see half of). What I think I loved even more than that was the aging of the characters. The VN does feature a time skip, and the character portraits age appropriately. Its a fantastic touch, one I’d like to see more VNs with a time skip or long time progression do.\n\nI really only have one area I feel the need to be nit picky on with Cursed Sight. The writing style can be confusing at times, and this is mostly due to the presentation of the writing. Like most VNs Cursed Sight features a text box, but it reads more like a book/novel rather than a VN. The portrait and name of the person speaking do not appear when there is dialogue. Instead, it works like a book, with the quoted dialogue being followed by, “said Miyon” or “she said sadly”. At times, I found myself getting lost trying to figure out who was speaking, though this is more due to my fast reading pace than it not being stated.\n\nCursed Sight is a fantastic, tightly bound narrative that will pull on the heartstrings more than once. It features fun, enjoyable characters, with great production values, and a wonderful story. It is a bit on the shorter side, clocking in for me at a bit under 2 hours, but it’s very focused on telling its story, and does not add too many fluff scenes just to pad out the length. I highly recommend Cursed Sight for any OELVN fans, and VN fans alike.","December 31, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackkel/recommended/360550/","jackkel","Jackkel Dragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackkel/","204 products in account","I highly recommend this visual novel. While it's "short" enough to finish in a single sitting (about 2 hours to reach every ending if you make use of strategically placed saves or the scene skip system), this works to the game's advantage, as it rarely feels like the story is stagnating as it can in stories that focus on the slice-of-life elements that are often found in longer visual novels.\n\nThe pacing is a bit awkward near the beginning, but the majority of the game is very well-written. The only "flaw" I noticed in the game was that two major plot points are so heavily foreshadowed that genre-savvy readers can tell what will happen long in advance, but this isn't always a bad thing.\n\nFair warning: there is no unambiguously happy ending to this game. All 4 endings involve bad things happening, and even the "Final" ending unlocked from completing the other 3 can be seen as a sad ending.\n\nAnother quick thing to note is that while there are elements of romance in this game, it is not a romance-focused visual novel. There are no "character routes" that change who the main character is interested in. If being able to choose the protagonist's love interest is what you're looking for, this may not be the right game.\n\nBottom line: If you're looking for a visual novel with a well-written and serious story that won't require weeks of reading to finish, this is a good choice.","August 16, 2015","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There're four endings but it's pretty much like in those books you can choose the end instead of directly intercede in the story. I won't say it's a bad game but it's almost not a game at all since you will keep on reading till the end... It's not what I was expecting but don't hesitate to try it (specially if there's a good offer in the price!). You can spend a nice time with it (you can finish the game in about 3 hours) because it's quick but dont expect you will actually be playing, moving a character and making your own choises there.","August 17, 2015","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/assassinglasgow/recommended/360550/","assassinglasgow","AssassinGlasgow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/assassinglasgow/","344 products in account","So I played InvertMouse's free VN Without Within here on Steam, and at the time I gave it a weak recommendation only because it was free and short. Now that I've gotten a sampling of a longer VN that's paid for from InvertMouse, I'm sad to say that it's not much better.\n\nSo, the good things. Art and music are fantastic, as well as certain choice aspects (providing a branching screen where we can go back to important decisions instead of saving all the time), as well as a switch in narrative at one point in the story.  The concept itself is fascinating, and some of the scenes were great, However, that brings us to...\n\n...the writing. The events that take place were really interesting, but the writing handled them very poorly, with very weak linkages. Characters that we are supposed to feel for suffer from poor development, making it hard to empathize in certain scenes. Motivations that drive key political players (and the overarching war in Taria) get thrown out the window (as well as logic) in several endings of the game, making for a baffiling conclusion to various routes. The writing is at times incredibly bulky, often with really, really bad word choices or phrases that kill any immersion with the story, as well as making me really, really dislike our main character Gai.\n\nIndeed...out of all the characters in the story, he frustrated me the most. The story is supposed to show that he has grown up, but 90% of the story shows absolutely no indication of that, and when we do see a more mature Gai, it's in one or two endings and is not nearly as smooth and cohesive as I think the writer intended it to be. A lot of things are just thrown into the route to be taken as word, when it would have worked way better had it been shown through development (this goes for all character development and relationship development...don't get me started on the love story).\n\nI think this story really suffers from being short. If the writer had taken time to write more to flesh it out, it would have been stronger and able to stand up on its own. Sure, it would have taken longer to read, but I think, as evidenced by this and Without Within, the writer has difficulty making short stories and would benefit more writing something longer. It just seems he or she has trouble balancing the fine line between condensing the story and still writing believable characters and interactions. It's a shame, because I truly think the concept behind the story is fantastic.","December 26, 2015","false","3.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

Several technical errors were found in the narrative, and the overall tone and language don't fit. In fact, I've come to dislike the main character, Gai, due to the way he is portrayed.\n\nOther problems:\n\n1. There are areas in the novel that became boring and uninteresting that I've skipped several parts just to get to the end.\n2. The final ending is very confusing and feels out of place.\n3. The shift from Gai's point of view to Miyon's was surprising and unexpected. I think it could be done in ways that blend well with the flow of the story.\n\nOverall, there's still a lot that can be done for this novel. Until significant changes are made, I wouldn't recommend this to others.","November 30, 2015","false","3.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I almost expected to find the Necronomicon next). The MC feels and talks more like a modern teenager than any peasant servant has any right to.\n- Length- ~3 hours.\n- Got it on sale for £2.49, Probably would not pay more for the length so wait for at least 50%.\n- No true happy endings and the 'best' one almost made me cry.

After playing the game and achieving all 4 endings I am still not sure about my feelings towards the game.\n\nThe beginning of the novel started out at a nice pace, providing insights into the world that Gai was from and the society he was being thrown into. The narration, background art, and music was all stunning during the first 20 minutes of the game, and had me completely hooked.\n\nUnfortunately once the character Sasa was introduced I felt as though I could slowly tell where the story was going, and some of the major plot points became predictable. Suddenly the music and background art became repetitive, and the narration had turned into something more light hearted, with some sort of slapstick humor occurring every other scene.\n\nBy the middle of the game I felt like I was reading something entirely different than what I had originally enjoyed. Miyon, who had been a very interesting character to me from the start, became a hollow tsundere, and Gai seemed to become more immature and annoying despite 8 years passing since the beginning of the game. Each ending felt rushed, and I was disappointed with the "true ending" which was only unlocked after viewing the other 3.\n\nDespite everything I have said I would recommend this game to someone new to visual novels, or trying to get into the genre. It is an easy read, and few choices have to be made during the game. I found the concept of "cursed sight" to be enjoyable, but the execution of it was not quite to my tastes. Overall I would give this game a 5/10.\n","August 12, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every time I think back to it, I cry a river on the inside. I am proud to have Cursed Sight be my first ever review on Steam. Thank you, InvertMouse. <3\n\nI will do my best to keep my review spoiler-free.\n\nThe Story\nYou are Gai, a young boy at the age of 10, who has been sold to the temple of East Taria by your parents. You work as a servant in the temple, moreso a slave, and have the assignment of tending over a girl generally the same age as Gai, named Miyon, or as the kingdom sees her, the "Treasure of the Nation," for she has a unique ability to control fate, at the cost of her eyesight.\n\nI believe this anything past this would be deemed a spoiler, so I'll end this here.\n\nAudio and Visuals\nBoth elements in Cursed Sight are amazing to say the least. The artwork is beautifully drawn, showing every detail on the character's faces, including expression changes. As you progress on through the story, you even have the chance to see chibi versions of some of the characters. The backgrounds, too, were full of detail and nice to look at. The BGM for the novel is also very fitting for each scene. My heart was racing during some scenes just because of the BGM, it's  THAT  good.\n\nOverall, this is a visual novel worth buying, I highly recommend this. This story had me invested from beginning to end, I'm sure it'll have you, too. It's a nice change of pace for visual novel fans.

The story is really good, touching and emotional. The art looks nice. The the soundtrack is not so varied, but it fit the situations.

Lets see in detail, what went good and what should be better.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\n+ Nice timing of chapters\n+ Animations\n+ Multiple endings\n- Some cruel moments\n\nChapters were timed perfectly, story was a bit cliché, but originally processed, what I count as a great plus for this title, due in time, when everything was discovered, original presentation is a key how to achieve a players attention. Also animations were fine, I am glad, that also multiple endings were positive feature, not just self-purpose.\n\nBut the moment with rabbit was very cruel and disturbing. I know, this was the purpose, but I think it might be avoided. Just personal opinion. :-D\n\nCHARACTERS\n\n+ Gai\n+ Miyon\n+ Sasa\n+ Queen Hydrianne\no King Lok\n- West Tarians\n\nGai was funny, but also I liked his saracsm, as a kid who was torn from his world and sent to slavery. Miyon was a typical spoiled brat, but when you went under her mask, you saw, what was the true reason behind her behaviours. I liked Sasa from the very start, she was as catalysator of other relationships and a mentor who would everyone desire to have. Positive character was also Queen Hydrianne, I think that is how a leader should behave.\n\nKing lok was neutral, I understand his pose, yet, the potential was not fully achieved. But West Tarians had their potentials a bit wasted, especially Gai's sister's companion, who was changing his appearance and poses too quickly and a bit cheaply.\n\nVISUALS\n\n+ Shoujo style\n\nI liked, that this style was chosen, it fitted perfectly for the set-up and story. Nothing to complain here about.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\n\n+ Fitting the stiuation\n+ Atmospheric\n\nEfe Tozan did a great work composing those songs, I liked them and some of them I listen to even today. Songs were changing accordingly to the situation and atmosphere. Thumbs up here.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nCursed sight has a rich story and no superheroes, what allows players to join them and enjoy, what authors presented to us. Even players out of this genre might find this novel interesting, as story is not disturbing, drawings are decent and atmosphere brilliant.\n\nRecommended, also with extras.","March 4","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every choice leads to a different ending.\n- the art is pretty and tasteful though fairly simple.\n- The writing is decent although it gets out of the setting character sometimes  (references to chainsaw hands in a medieval China-like country? I almost expected to find the Necronomicon next). The MC feels and talks more like a modern teenager than any peasant servant has any right to.\n- Length- ~3 hours.\n- Got it on sale for £2.49, Probably would not pay more for the length so wait for at least 50%.\n- No true happy endings and the 'best' one almost made me cry. Very touching and sentimental.\n\nOverall, 7/10. +1 if you love drama and getting your heart strings tugged.","December 26, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's basically a reading novel.\n\nI really wanted to like this VN game, but it was definitely more of a VN than a game. I will still rate it good, but only because the visuals and music was amazing. I loved the look and feel of the characters. But it was hard to be in the main character's mind. Basically I would only get this game at sale's price and not the full price if you want something to be entertained for a hour or so.\n\nI do think what Invertmouse is doing is amazing, and look forward to other games put out by this developer, but I hope it grows into something even better and perhaps more choices and gameplay.","January 21","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
