Gameplay is dated and clunky with frequent glitches, awkward anchor points and occasional invisible components. UI is also poor.","November 2, 2015","false","0.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I finally settled on a medium quality setting which I think may have been 2090 x 1024 and the game loads. Previous review said very frustrated with game due to budget indicator not appearing to work at times and a no-brainer at the start of the Medium Levels. Here I now am entering the Advanced Levels saying ... For goodness sake DON'T GIVE UP like I nearly did!!! I would actually now recommend this but it's essential to take your time and observe those failures closely. The clue to what type of bridge is best built ... Is in the lie of the land around you.\n\nPlaying this game with the help of one of the Design Engineers who worked on the Second Severn River Crossing into Wales and he says that it's fine physics-wise. But he also advises to take your time and do not get frustrated even if your bridge just fell for the twentieth time! In the industry Failure Modes and Effects Analysis handles all this - in this game you have to. BEST OF LUCK!!!","December 31, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
