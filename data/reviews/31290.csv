What's more is that it's amazingly done and Telltale not only brought back many of our favourite characters from the show (and timelines, too) but we get to meet new ones, as well.\n\nThe plot revolves around the disappearance of Doc and once Marty finds out he ended up in 1931 he is set out to save him - of course, speeding up to 88 miles per hour is a must for the journey to begin! It is an era of gangsters and speakeasies due to the prohibition of alcohol and of course this time period has its antagonist in the form of a Tannen.\n\nI would love to go on and elaborate the story but it would be a spoiler, plus, this game is best played if you are a fan of the trilogy as there are so many references to each film that it really helps you with the immersion. Bob Gale (creator of the trilogy) was brought on board to assist with the game's story, hence the references and the similarly funny nature of many of the dialogues.\n\nAs for the gameplay: it is a standard point-and-click adventure game but unlike the classic ones (Lucasarts) released decades ago this one only has a small inventory (you never really have more than 5 items with you for long) and it is always one or two places where you can wander about and once you completed the needed task the story progresses accordingly taking you to new areas. Some puzzles can require some thinking but if you are desperate you can always use the in-game "Hint" function at your leisure.\n\nI enjoyed the story from beginning to end but I must admit I felt the tale lost its momentum around episode 4. It became a bit convoluted and I wished it'd end as soon as possible. The ending made up for the last episode's shortcomings and I might just do another walkthrough after I finished watching the films once more. Having been released 5 years ago this Telltale adventure does not have any achievements and nor do we have decisions that can result in a different story progression - this time it is as linear as it gets.\n\nOverall, Back To The Future The Game is a great video game and I hope Hollywood will never ruin the trilogy by making a sequel or remaking it. This game is another hint for them so that the story can be left alone for good. If you liked the production of Zemeckis and Spielberg and you're also appreciative of the games Telltale releases this game is a must for you!","September 26, 2015","true","3.3"," 123 of 129 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","123","129","5","0"

No, seriously, you NEED this game. Period. The storyline is incredibly good and feels authentic to the original movies, pushing the characters in interesting directions that I hadn't expected. It takes place after the movies, and as Marty McFly you'll end up traveling back to prohibition era Hill Valley after discovering that a prolonged absence by Doc Brown is due to his having been murdered back in the 30's. As expected, traveling back in time to save him leads to unexpected alterations in the timeline and a frantic hustle to fix one mess, only to create another. Overall it's very cleverly written and worthy of the franchise.\n\nAesthetically, the game takes a more stylized cartoonish approach to the characters rather than attempting realism - something that I personally rather enjoyed. And the voice acting - hoo man the voice acting is amazing! Christopher Lloyd reprises his role as Emmet Brown, and though Michael J Fox does not reprise his, the person who fills in as Marty does such an amazingly good impression that I literally could not tell the difference. Seriously, I was genuinely shocked to learn it hadn't been Fox voicing him. Best yet, Fox returns for a couple of cameo roles in the final episode.\n\nFrom a gameplay standpoint, it's a point-and-click adventure with pretty simple puzzles. Overall its approach is straight forward and only a small handful of times did I find myself getting hung up on a puzzle - however, the puzzles aren't really the point so much as that you're involved in an interactive movie, and this is made very clear by the fact the game has a hints feature that will outright TELL you the answers if you're well and truly stuck, allowing you to breeze through the story at a pace that's already hardly broken by frustration. At least, not in terms of the puzzles themselves. This isn't to say this game isn't without issue - things like movement is a bit buggy and aggravated me quite a bit, especially when switching between sceneries. The inventory is also kind of annoying the way it makes you have to scroll through it instead of having all items available at once. As inconvenient as this can sometimes be, it's hardly enough to detract from what makes this game shine.\n\nSeriously, if you're a fan of the movies, put this in your collection. You'll thank yourself.","July 21, 2014","true","5.3"," 60 of 65 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","60","65","0","0"

A GREAT MOVIE GAME! Marty, we have got to go back to the past to stop the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ NES game version of our movie from coming out! Set date to September 1989, to destroy LJN for making horrible movie games! - Doc Brown\n\nIf this game was created and substituted for the Back to the Future game on the NES, everyone would be super happy. THIS GAME is awesome, point and click, who gives af? It has great narrating, and the Art style is SWEET. This game is like a Sequel, taking place after the events of the first 3, starting off in 1986, Doc is missing, and Marty has to find him back in 1931! It explores the past of Hill Valley. That's all I will go into, since it is WAY more in depth than that, I recommend this game, STRONGLY if you love or like the BTTF series, and it is very cheap too, and it will go on sale for even cheaper.\n\nI give it a 9.5 out of 10 for a final rating, sometimes it is a LITTLE confusing, and somewhat buggy, but otherwise it is solid for a release from 2010, they could do much more with this series now, seeing Telltale's success with The Walking Dead Season 1 and 2, which are very in depth too.\n\nBUY THIS GAME.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoryStarkiller/recommended/31290/","CoryStarkiller","CoryStarkiller","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoryStarkiller/","893 products in account","Back To The Future: The Game is heavy.\n\nEpisode 1 feels like classic BTTF1. Very rewarding for fans of the series, full of lots of references. Everything you could want from the reintroduction. Some things are new, and other things are still tied to the original series. The introduction of Young Emmett “Doc” Brown is a nice addition to the series. The puzzles are fine, but not the main appeal.\n\nEpisode 2 feels like classic BTTF2, during the past timeline. This is where the game starts to stand on its own, rather than relying on a heavy dose of nostalgia. This episode further develops the characters of the game, introducing the major conflict of the game. The puzzles are much better, and far more logical than the puzzles of Episode 1.\n\nEpisode 3 feels like classic BTTF2, during the alternate present/future timeline. Continues the story established in Episode 2, while allowing the player the opportunity to see an alternate version of the cast of the original movie.  This cast manages to hold true to the classic personalities, while giving the characters a new reality to react to. The puzzles feel very heavy handed when compared to the previous two episodes. They rely far more on trial & error, over logic or clear direction like the previous episodes' puzzles. The highlight of the puzzles in this episode would be the heavy metal guitar battle.\n\nEpisode 4 doesn't feel like a classic BTTF movie. But this is not a bad thing. By this point, Young Doc learns how to stand on his own two feet, which is also what happens with the story. It no longer needs the safety net of the classic movie trilogy any more. While this episode might have the worst and most tedious puzzle in the game, conversely the story is one of the highpoints of the entire game. Asking heavy questions like “Is it worth hurting a friend, to do what is right?” and “How do you deal with someone that has given up hope?”. This episode manages to juggle these types of questions, while still advancing the story into the final chapter. By the end of episode 4, this story has truly become its own, and worthy of the BTTF name.\n\nEpisode 5 resolves all the stories created from Episode 1 through Episode 4, and at the same time it feels like classic BTTF3. This episode, by far, has the best puzzle in the game. This puzzle actually advances the plot, rather than being that annoying thing that stops the story from progressing. As this episode gives closure to the game, it pays homage to the series, with the ending that ties back into the classic BTTF1 ending.\n\nIf I would have known that the writer of the movies helped write this game, I would have played it years ago. The gameplay isn't the main attraction here. The reason anyone would play this game, is for the story. While the story is VERY linear, this is not a negative. We are more interested in allowing Marty to fix the timeline, over having a heavy focus on gameplay or a branching narrative. This game is going for a cinematic presentation, and it would never be considered a bad goal to aim for, as it is creating its own spot in the BTTF legacy alongside the trilogy of movies. It knows how to do a proper BTTF story, while still breaking new ground worthy of being included in the canon of the series. The Young Doc storyline shows us that no matter what influences the future, you will still become the heavy hitter that you were always destined to be. There are so many great references and parallels to the movie trilogy, it feels rewarding to fans of the series, as we are not ignored for a new vision of the universe. It really respects the original trilogy, which is rare for a video game based in a movie universe. This game manages to create new classic BTTF moments, without completely relying on constant references to the movies.\n\nIt has the “classic” Telltale problem with reading the previous episode's gamesave for the choices you made in the previous episodes. Luckily the number of times the later episodes check the gamesave is minimal, so it is only a minor annoyance. It's best to just choose the first “cover name” for Marty, because that is what the game defaults to, if it fails to correctly check the first gamesave for the name you have actually chosen. This allows for your immersion to not be broken, while bypassing the problem of Telltale's bad programming.\n\nThere is a heavy amount of heart and joy in this game, and it is safe for all members of the family to share. Because of this fact, it is a true sequel to the BTTF trilogy, and has earned the title of being called Back To The Future Part 4.\n\nBack To The Future Part 1 – 10/10\nBack To The Future Part 2 – 9.7/10\nBack To The Future Part 3 – 9.9/10\nBack To The Future Part 4 – 9.8/10\n\nHappy Back To The Future Day! I hope we all ended up creating a better future for ourselves, than Marty did today in the original BTTF2 timeline, before he learned his lesson in BTTF3.","October 21, 2015","true","3.2"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","46","51","4","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/glitchedjoygirl/recommended/31290/","glitchedjoygirl","Soultaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/glitchedjoygirl/","413 products in account","Few movies hold the place in the public conscious like Back To The Future. Since their release in the 80's and early 90's, the Back To The Future movies have captivated generation after generation. There are probably several reasons these movies had such a massive impact and are still being watched today. One reason could be the loveable characters, and another could be that a lot of movies have used time travel as a plot, but Back To The Future was the first to really get it RIGHT.\n\nI personally grew up watching the animated series on Saturday mornings, and watching Marty and Doc travel in time always was such a fun time for me. Then at a later age I watched the movies and they have since become three of my favourite movies ever. So naturally, when I heard there was a game coming out, and it was going to be an adventure game developed by Telltale, who have already been responsible for mostly single-handedly bringing the glory of graphic adventure games, such as Monkey Island and Sam & Max, back to gamers, I was pretty hyped. For some reason I waited until all the episodes had been done, which I don't regret since it made me able to get the complete experience right away.\n\nTo best describe BTTF The Game would be to call it a fourth movie. Story-wise, the game remains incredibly faithful to the canon established by the movies and the plot is very well-written and always seem to make sense within the rules established by them, though this could mostly be credited to the team using Bob Gale and Robert Zemmeckis as story consultants, making sure the continuity would never be broken in any severe way as this could really have ruined the game in a major way. I won't spoil the story for those who have yet to play this game, but all I can say is that it really feels like it could be the plot of a fourth movie, and it has enough twists and turns to keep each episode worth playing. A genious twist is that each episode ends on a cliffhanger that leaves you aching to play the next, and even the final episode has a bit of a teaser at the end, leading us to expect another BTTF game some time in the foreseeable future.\n\nAnother great aspect about the game is obviously the voice acting. While they couldn't get Michael J. Fox to reprise his role as Marty, they found a very great replacement in AJ LoCascio who sounds eerily similar to Fox. Thankfully, Chris Lloyd is back, great and funny as ever as the old Doc from the movies. It doesn't really feel like he has aged much in the last 20-30 years, and he does a great job bringing Doc back to life, though I doubt anyone else could really have done it. The acting feels natural and unforced and unlike many games where the voices could feel robotic and like they were simply reading a script, the voices in this game really adds tons of personality and flavour to the rich gallery of people that are featured thruout the episodes.\n\nThose looking for realistic graphics though should probably look away from this game. The game opts for a more cartoony style that feels very reminiscent of Monkey Island, another franchise that Telltale has "reanimated". However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing as the animation is great and adds even more personality to the game and gives its a very unique charming style. I did notice some issues with the graphics though, such as black lines appearing randomly, however the game ran perfectly smoothly even with everything maxed out in 1080 HD resolution, so it did not detract too much from an otherwise enjoyable experience.\n\nThe controls feel highly reminiscent of a classic point-and-click adventure game where you use the mouse to make Marty look at things and pick them up or examine them. Everything has been simplified to a simple intuitive click of a button and the game feels really easy to play. The inventory screen is easy to use and you can make Marty examine items for clues and such. Another helpful feature in the game is the hint system, which greatly helps if one gets stuck, which often tends to happen with people who rarely play these games or are new to the genre. The game also lets you view what goal Marty has, which in of itself gives you a clue what to do.\n\nOverall, I can't really find anything negative to say about this game. If you like adventure games like Monkey Island, Grim Fandango or Day of the Tentacle, then I highly recommend this. Not only does it continue the BTTF franchise in a way that no new movie ever could, it's also a blast to play and should give the fans of the movies tons of laughs and an overall great experience. Some moments felt a bit tedious, but in total it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience for me.\n\nSummary:\nStory: 10/10\nGreat story that sticks faithfully to the rules and plot points established by the movie trilogy, with great voice acting from AJ LoCascio and Christopher Lloyd as well as a whole cast of great characters.\nGraphics: 9/10\nAside from a few glitches here and there, the graphics are great, colourful and with tons of personality. Has that typical Telltale charm that no one can replicate.\nControls: 10/10\nNothing bad to say as the game offers several control methods and all of them are a blast to play with.\nPresentation: 9/10\nA few moments in the game felt tedious, which detracted slightly from the overall experience, which was great.\n\nTotal score: 10/10\n\nIf you haven't played this, but love either BTTF or adventure games, then this is a must-have title.","January 10, 2014","true","5.6"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","35","36","0","1"

When the best game based on the series up until now was a Grand Theft Auto: Vice City mod, it doesn't speak very well of the efforts that came before it. Still, with Telltale's new effort, the series finds what might be its first good commercial adaptation. With excellent use of the movies running jokes, themes, and soundscape, and Telltale's clever writing and puzzle-crafting, Back to the Future manages to be the first commercial Back to the Future video game worth the name.\n\nTaking place shortly after Back to the Future part 3, in the wake of Doc Brown leaving Hill Valley, the game opens with Marty McFly and his father preparing Doc's possessions for an estate sale. However, when the time-traveling DeLorean returns to 1986, empty save for a cassette recorder, a lady's shoe, and Doc Brown's dog, it's up to you, as Marty, to uncover where and when Doc is, what kind of trouble he's in, and how to rescue him.\n\nThe games dialogue is pitch-perfect, with Christopher Lloyd reprising his role as Doc Brown, and AJ LoCascio stepping into Martys role with an uncanny interpretation of the character that I could barely distinguish from Michael J. Fox. Telltales writing is spot on, hitting many of the movie series running jokes, while being more than clever in its own right. Whether it's a soup-delivering do-gooder announcing that she has to run food to the asylum because the inmates are just crazy for it, or Doc Brown warning that eating at the soup kitchen will cause permanent damage to Martys digestive system in the same panicked tones he uses to refer to the destruction of time itself, the writing is spot on, and the dialogue is delivered expertly.\n\nThe games graphics are charming; with a cartoonish bent that pervades the game. The character designs fit their roles in the game, and while the differences in the level of caricature can be momentarily alarming, as the comparison between Marty and Doc Browns proportions took me aback when I first noticed them, the interpretation works better, and the characters have more life and expression to them than a more realistic approach would have. Meanwhile, the music draws its cues from the films, with numerous familiar themes coming back around, and fans of the movies scores will find a lot to recognize and enjoy.\n\nThe gameplay itself is a relatively simple adventure game. The puzzles are all either dialogue-based or involve using items straight from the inventory with little combination or other elaborate inventory tricks to be found. A robust help system will ease players who can't boggle through the solutions through the game, though the puzzles are straightforward enough that veteran players might not find much to challenge them. Still, the focus is on the story rather than the puzzles, and they manage to succeed brilliantly, especially with a surprisingly tense set of puzzles at the very end.\n\nTelltale Games' legions of fans have every reason to fall in love with it, because it's a cross between the developer's trademark point-and-click gameplay and the excellent story of the Back to the Future series. Telltale managed to make me feel eight years old again. It may not be time travel, but it could be the closest you can get without a flux capacitor.","April 17","true","24.4"," 34 of 35 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","34","35","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/torchiest/recommended/31290/","torchiest","Torchiest","http://steamcommunity.com/id/torchiest/","505 products in account","I can't recommend this game enough. There are a few groups of people for whom this is a no-brainer: adventure game fans and Back to the Future fans. But just about anyone should be able to enjoy the mix of action, humor, and sentiment present in this episodic adventure.\n\nThis game gave me about the same feeling as the Ghostbusters video game from 2009: it feels like a true sequel to the movies, with enough of the original cast involved, and with strong enough writing, that it fits right in with the films. In fact, in some ways, the adventures here are superior, simply because they're not really restricted by budgets, set design, etc. They can do whatever they want, and they take advantage of that fact.\n\nTo be fair, there were a few points that I got a bit frustrated with the solutions, because they seemed nonsensical, or it seemed like I had already tried them, but those weren't too frequent at all, and there is a hint system that will dole out more and more obvious clues if you're really stuck. On that note, it's important to backtrack and double check things if you're not sure what to do, as oftentimes events will trigger changes in the environment or characters where you wouldn't expect them.\n\nThe story itself though, is amazing. The game starts out a bit slow, taking a while to find its groove, but is pretty solid throughout. You'll end up jumping back and forth through time many many times throughout the adventure, and have to fix and refix situations that go from bad to worse. The best episodes are probably three, four, and five.\n\nYou will probably get about 15-20hrs of gameplay out of the entire series, with the final episode having a pretty hilarious finish that left me with a huge grin on my face, and a teaser that there could yet be more to come. It's been four years since the game came out, so that might be nothing, but still, I could definitely see them drawing out quite a bit more from this deep well of stories. Overall, anyone with a passing interest in the genre or the movies will be well pleased.","July 13, 2015","true","11.9"," 40 of 49 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","40","49","6","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/E_net4/recommended/31290/","E_net4","E_net4","http://steamcommunity.com/id/E_net4/","107 products in account","A quite moving game!\n\nBack to the Future is my favourite science fiction trilogy, and after eagerly traversing all 5 episodes of this game, I must say it makes an inspiring and amusing sequel. Although not much effort was made to fill the environments with many citizens, as it would have been expected for a more realistic recreation of each era, the main characters, including new ones, are remarkably well polished in personality. The original ones were given the same personality and vibrance as in the films, in fact. In addition, Marty McFly feels just the way he's meant to be from the very beginning: a cool-yet-sloppy teenager. And even though he was played by a different voice actor, his voice sounds extremely similar to Michael J Fox's from a few decades ago.\n\nThe gameplay is quite similar to the Monkey Island series'. Attempting to slash the frustration of getting stuck, we are given a hint system that provides clues on demand without spoiling it immediately. These are entirely optional, so in general, it is a plus. Those who are used to the old sk00l point-and-click adventures may not need this anyway. The UI could have been made slightly better by adjusting the character movement by keyboard, which sometimes did not behave as expected. I also got myself into a strange bug in chapter 5, in which Marty may get into a place he's not expected to go to. Not saying where, but a reload doesn't hurt much here.\n\nThe story was both fascinating and touching in many parts. As Marty and Doc visit past and present instants of time, they find their own reality suddenly changing, often to the worse. It's like visiting the corrupted Hill Valley from Part 2, except that all alternate timelines are different, and they must figure out new ways to get back in time and save their reality. All this while helping past selves, avoiding running into other past selves, persuading alternative selves and making your opinion become heard on what spices to put on a week-old cabbage soup. Indeed.\n\nI had relatively quick game sessions in this game, and now there isn't much reason to replay it. I guess these kind of games must come to an end, unless they make alternate endings like in The Walking Dead. I'm not sure whether I would have liked that in BttF, though. To conclude, I guess I'll go for 7.4/10. I would certainly send a friend back in time. *Back in Time song*","June 22, 2015","true","4.2"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","26","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladynarayan/recommended/31290/","ladynarayan","Narayan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladynarayan/","393 products in account","Back to the Future: The Game is a dialogue & story focused adventure game. Unlike other Telltale games I've played & liked (Walking Dead, Wolf Among Us, a bit of Game of Thrones) it strays a bit from their formula. There are no choices whatsoever (not even the illusory ones) - the story is strictly predefined without even the tiniest of detours. The general quality of the game seems to be subpar at best in comparison to their previous titles. The controls are clunky, the graphics lacks detail and overall polish, the UI elements are huge (mobile like) and obtrusive (even after turning off everything the game allowed me to). And unlike other Telltale games, where you don't really need to know the source material - here you do. You should be familiar with the movies, as the game starts sometime after 3rd movie ended, and not only doesn't explain who is who, but also casually showers you with references assuming you remember everything in detail. If I haven't re-watched the movies recently to refresh my memory, I feel like I would have been at a disadvantage.\n\nFor some weird reason the game is split into 5 separate entries in the Steam library, forcing user to re-apply their settings every time they start a new chapter. No wonder no decisions can't be made here, because nothing carries over to the next chapter, since each has to be started as a separate game. The only thing you decide upon in first chapter - your fake name you introduce yourself in the past, is instantly invalidated in chapter 2, where other game inhabitants insist on calling the protagonist what seems to be a default name from the ch1 list. Also I've noticed the time played is not summed up. Chapter 1 time is displayed as total time (which in my case was around 14 hours total, not 3.3 as shown).\n\nThe default movement controls require you to left click and drag to move, and on top of that right clicking makes Marty run. Thing is, the right click also skips dialogue, so gods forbid you bump into another character while running like that - you will immediately skip first few lines of dialogue without any option to go back and listen to them. Thankfully you can also move with WSAD and use Shift to run to avoid accidental skip, but the game doesn't tell you that. The environment is so littered with invisible walls that it borders on ridiculous at times & trying to walk can be an exercise in patience. You'd think that in an open area you can cross the road wherever you want - well nope, just in specific nondescript junction points. Rarely you're allowed to just walk up to something in a straight line. Most of the time it feels like being forced into invisible rails.\n\nClickboxes (clickable areas that allow interaction with objects) are inconsistent. Sometimes they are so huge that clicking several cm from an object still triggers an interaction. Sometimes they are so tiny, that even when you know for sure that they should be there somewhere, you still need to comb the screen carefully with your mouse. Sometimes an object had more than one clickbox separated by empty space, and even though you'd think that the 2nd one is for a different object it still triggeres interaction with the thing you already checked. Whenever I found myself stuck, it usually turned out later that I missed one vital object that was either hard to pinpoint or overshadowed by a bigger nearby object with a huge clickbox. This was particularly frustrating when I had to do a lot of back and forth between several locations. The difficulty mainly came from finding all the interactive objects. Once you pinpointed where everything was, it was quite easy from there.\n\nAfter first two chapters I was convinced I will be giving this game thumbs down. Even though I liked the story and character development, I wasn't enjoying it and instead I was just irritated most of the time due to game's several issues and disappointing quality & mechanics. The events past chapter 3 raised the stakes, so I became determined to push though & finish the game to see how it all ends. And even though there were so many time jumps, fixing one thing resulting in messing up another and spawning yet another fubar timeline, that there should have been bajillion paradoxes already (not to mention a silly explanation where did the DeLorean came from in the first place), despite all that I'm glad I've played though it. Mainly because the final chapter was indeed great, and the ending was so adorably self aware of its own plot shortcomings, that it put a wide smile on my face and basically redeemed the rest of the game in my eyes :)\n\nIf you're planning on playing this game and like me you thought "I like Telltale games and I like Back to the Future movies, so this game should be no-brainer" be aware that this might not be the case. The overall quality & design is disappointing compared to other major Telltale titles. The story is really neat with satisfying finale, but one might consider just watching a let's play instead of having to deal with game's clunkiness and irritating issues. Myself I prefer playing instead of watching, and I'm still in good mood after having beaten the game, so my "on fence" stance is slightly tipped towards thumbs up :) Buyer beware though :)","May 13","true","3.3"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

In it, you play as Marty McFly, dealing with a variety of puzzles as he attempts to set right the past - largely dealing with the 1930s Prohibition-era Hill Valley.\n\nThis is a good game, but it feels like it could have been so much more. It was released prior to Telltale's The Walking Dead success, so it largely relies on their older formula of having a large inventory where you collect items, then use those items to solve puzzles, along with having a large number of items which can be interacted with, many of which are extraneous. There's nothing *wrong* with this, but given they were trying to provide a story more on-level with feature films, it ends up feeling like the gameplay is getting in the way of what they were trying to accomplish as opposed to complementing it.\n\nVoice acting is excellent, the story was actually better than I expected (except for one or two areas which don't really "mesh" with how time travel is supposed to work in this universe). So basically, if you don't mind the way older point and click adventure games tend to play, and if you're not TOO invested in the storyline/mechanics of the BttF universe, it's probably worth a look.","March 13, 2014","true","2.6"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","2"

Back to the Future: The Game was one of the last ones that used this format.\nIn a sense, this was a match made in heaven, since the movie trilogy itself was one of the last large-budget adventures on the big screen. It was a large task to try and match it, but for the most part, the creators did a good job.\n\nThe story begins not so long after the movies, when Marty finds Doc’s distress signal sent from 1931. This sets off a chain of events that involve a run-in with another troublemaking Tannen, and a woman who accidentally becomes young Doc’s girlfriend, leading him on a path that results in Hill Valley turning into a police state. And the episodes themselves have even more twists and cliffhangers, keeping up your interest.\nOn the other hand, it needs these tricks to keep you in the game, because like all old TellTale titles, it is very slow, and most of the events take place at one location (in this case, the town square). The studio’s formula is also present in full force: all episodes have the same structures and similar solutions to similar problems, always including a multi-choice puzzle where you need to run back and forth until you stumble upon the right combination.\n\nThe dialogues were always TellTale’s strong point, and Back to the Future is no exception. The entire series is a love letter to the movie trilogy, and the return of Christopher Lloyd (and Michael J. Fox for a few lines at the last episode) really helped to make you feel that this is as close as we can get to a fourth film without an actual fourth film.","October 22, 2015","true","2.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","2"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews - Game 19\nBack to the Future - The Game\nPurchase Date: 9/15/2014\n\nNormally I don't really play adventure games, but I've always heard good things about Telltale games.  So when I saw this on sale in the Humble Store I decided to go ahead and pick it up.\n\nAt first the art style threw me off a little, but I was quickly sold on the colorful, cartoony art.  I was also concerned about the voice acting, but that proved to be not an issue at all, as Telltale got Christopher Lloyd to once again voice Doc Brown.  And although Michael J. Fox isn't voicing Marty, the actor still does a good job.  It was also nice to hear familiar music.\n\nGoing in, I was concerned this would end up not feeling authentic.  But between the acting, the sound, and the art, the game does a good job of making you feel like this is another Back to the Future adventure.  I didn't find myself being distracted by anything that felt wrong.\n\nThe gameplay is exactly what you'd expect from a point and click adventure.  I didn't see any Quick Time Events in the hour I played, so really the gameplay is focused more on solving puzzles.  I found the challenge to be pretty easy overall, but the game has a built in hint system to provide help if you get stuck.  It gives a set of 4 hints, starting with a vague suggestion, and the final hint telling you exactly what to do.  So it doesn't really seem like it's possible to get stuck in this game.  I could see where those looking for more of a challenge might be disappointed here, but really these types of games are all about the story.\n\nSpeaking of the story, I don't really want to spoil any of it, but I will say that it has everything you'd expect from a Back to the Future game.   I enjoyed the beginning of the story and how it sets up the initial time travel.  I liked the time period the game chose.  It's one that the movies didn't visit, but the choice makes a lot of sense.  I only got part way through the first episode before my hour was up, but I liked where the story was going.\n\nOverall I think Telltale has done a good job here.  I admit I had some trepidation when I first started playing this.   With a game like this that's based on an existing property, it's pretty natural to have some set expectations going in.  But my fears were unfounded, as Telltale hasn't given me anything to be disappointed with.  This is definitely worth picking up if you like adventure games, or even if you aren't much of an adventure gamer but still liked Back to the Future.","July 2, 2015","true","1.1"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","13","17","2","0"

The story is decently well-crafted thus far and the voice acting and direction is tremendous.  My issues with the game are MOSTLY technical:\n\n1) The camera is obnoxious and spastic at times.\n\n2) The movement controls curiously keep their memory as you walk despite the 'stage' changing orientation.  For instance, if I travel from a north/south stage to an east/west stage walking 'right' and Marty ROTATES 90 degrees in the transition, I would expect when my frame of reference changes that the 'right' arrow key continues moving Marty to the 'right' of his new orientation.  This isn't the case and you end up with some stages where you are pressing the right arrow key to move 'down and to the left' for instance because of some quizzical initial orientation during the transition.\n\n3) Poor continuity in parts.  In the first episode you choose a 'fake name' to give someone back in time.  When I saved and later reloaded my game, the game had forgotten my choice and I was momentarily concerned maybe I had missed something.  Nope.  Thinking 'well that must be the default' I was proven wrong again when the name changed to another option in EP2.  For a game literally all about the 'details' that seems really... lazy?\n\n4) Every episode apparently has its own 'game' shell which requires you to change ALL your settings each time you play a new one.\n\nHere's where the line between 'technical' and 'design decision' get a bit blurry though:\n\n5) The inventory randomly deletes certain items which, fine, I wouldn't need a key to one door later in the game provided I never go back.  However at one point you get a tool and a few minutes later when you are presented with a situation where the tool is a good solution, it is mysteriously missing.  It didn't get removed via story elements, just deleted from the inventory because the 'scene' changes.\n\n6) The puzzle solutions are not robust.  Whittling down the gameplay, you must select the right choices in the right order.  Dialogue options do not 'matter' in the sense that saying 'smart' things (maybe offering some dialogue that's generic and some that, if you were paying attention earlier in the game, would give you an advantage) makes no difference.  It's somewhat disappointing that there does not appear to be more than one way to solve any puzzle, just in some cases you can solve a few concurrent puzzles in a different order to the same outcome.\n\nHere's where it's mostly a minor gripe with the story, though:\n\n7) The game (thus far) obviously plays homage to the original trilogy, however it almost entirely avoids it.  It would have been nice to at least have had better 'woven' timeline.\n\nOverall, it's a game worth the sale price if you are an afficionado and I don't regret picking it up for ~$6 even if I struggle to f inish with some of the technical oddities.  I would not recommend it for full price, however.","October 21, 2015","false","2.3"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

If you are at all a fan of the films, you will definitely enjoy this title.\n\nThe story picks up after Part III, where Doc Brown has disappeared, and when his DeLorean appears out of nowhere, you must take control of Marty McFly and travel through time to find Doc and prevent the destruction of the space-time continuum. As the story really is this game’s main selling point, I won’t spoil it for you – find out what happens as you play through. At one point Bob Gale, the producer for the films, stated that the game’s story can be essentially considered Back to the Future Part IV.\n\nThe gameplay is highly reminiscent of the old LucasArts SCUMM adventure games such as The Secret of Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion, with the only major difference being that you control Marty directly with the WASD keys and not by clicking where you want him to go. To progress, you interact with characters to learn new information, and pick up and use items in appropriate places to complete goals. Those goals are visible in your inventory, and if you get stuck, you can ask for up to 3 optional hints (depending on the puzzle you are on).\n\nThe game is divided into 5 episodes, and each one is a separate game that must be downloaded individually. This is fine, but just a heads-up - your play records won’t be combined.\n\nYou can save at any time you’d like – IF YOU AREN’T DOING A PUZZLE. If you are in an action sequence of any sort, or doing a multi-step puzzle, you cannot save until it has been completed. This is a slight flaw in that it sometimes forces you to play for extended periods of time if you don’t want to scrap what you’ve been working on.\n\nEach episode will take you 2 to 4 hours to complete, and the game in total will clock in at around 15 hours. It’s a very fun adventure and a surprisingly thoughtful story. The difficulty level isn’t too high, and you won’t be forced to go to the Internet for a walkthrough more than 2 or 3 times if you’re familiar with point-and-click games and have good lateral thinking skills. Unfortunately, the replay value here is very low, simply due to the type of game Back to the Future is. Once you’ve completed the game, there really isn’t a point to going back and playing through it a second time, because it will just be the same story over again. But for a single play-through, it’s a lot of fun.\n\nIn conclusion, I would highly recommend Back to the Future: The Game to anyone who is a fan of the films (or the LucasArts games) and is looking for another story featuring the characters they know and love. It’s a true BTTF adventure from start to finish =)\n","December 23, 2015","true","3.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

The game is composed of a total of 5 episodes, each of them smartly connected between each other (like a TV mini-serie).\nAs a fan of Back To The Future, I think TellTale did a really amazing job to be authentic to the movies. From a graphic standpoint, however, it looks different to the movie but it has that usual charm you can encounter in TellTale games that still make it classy enough to not complain about it.\nFrom a gameplay perspective, you have to manage mouse control and keyboard for moving, which is bothersome to me, but it is still OK to manage. I am not a big fan of inventory that are not available right away in front of your eyes, which sadly this game have. I believe the inventory system a little annoying in the game.\nStory wise, it is very likable and rather similar to the movie structure, which is great. Actually I tend to even prefer what TellTale did with Dr. Emmett Brown than on the movie, he looks more human and not only kind of like the crazy scientist he was on the movies... Also, Marty McFly is definitely a great hero to play with and he is super awesome in the game. I like the introduction of new characters like Edna Strickland, Trixie Trotter and another family member of the McFly with Arthur...\nI am not a big fan of the chase sequence at the end of most the episodes, it is certainly reminescent of the movie endings but it lacks any fun gameplay in my opinion. I adore however some sequences such as in Episode 1 in Emmett's Lab, this was thought very smartly.\n\nI definitely felt in love with this game, despite it not being perfect, it has some kind of funny and yet enjoyable adventure that I was expecting to have with Back To The Future for a long long time ago.","February 16, 2014","true","4.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

The story is pretty much what you'd expect from a BTTF film: the Doc got himself trapped in the past, and it's up to Marty to rescue him. Sure, some might say that's a rehash of the third film, but it's much, much more than that, as the story quickly takes some interesting twists, and Marty must make sure he's able to return to the Hill Valley he remembers.\n\nThe game features great voicework thanks to Christopher Lloyd returning as Doc, and A.J. Locascio doing a fantastic work as Marty, due to Michael J. Fox being unable to perform. Even then, Michael J. Fox has a nice cameo in the final chapter, and it's great to have the original time travellers in the same place again.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes, it's a somewhat simple point-and-click adventure. It's not as complex as Telltale's later games, like The Walking Dead, as this game isn't heavily focused on choice; and, to be honest, it's good that it doesn't, considering the nature of the story, you don't want to add branching storylines on top of messing up the timestream. Even then, it's good some nice puzzles, some which may have you scratching your head if you're not used to playing games in this genre. However, the game is good enough to provide hints in case you become stuck. Still, I'd place a greater emphasis on the story when recommending this game, as I consider that to be the best part of it.\n\nAbout the story, while some people might have found it a bit confusing (and I don't blame them, that always happens when time travel is involved), I must say I really enjoyed it. It really feels like BTTF4, and I guess that's only natural, considering that Bob Gale (who wrote the films) contributed in the writing of this game.\n\nWell, I don't know what more to say. If you're a big fan of BTTF (like me) then go ahead and try out this game, it's great!","April 26","true","3.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

However, this is primarily due to the fact that the overwhelming majority of modern game developers seem to completely miss the mark when it comes to compelling narrative and an art style which complements the game.\n\nBack to the Future is a fun little dive back in time to the good ‘ol days of point and click adventure but with a very pleasing 3D skin overtop. As much as I've enjoyed my time with this game so far, I wish I could say it was a must buy throwback to the days of old, but I can’t.\n\nI don’t think there is any one aspect of this game that is detrimentally flawed but when I step away from the game after a play session I find that had it not been based upon a movie franchise I loved as a child, nothing about this game would stand on its own and draw me in. That’s not to say I don’t think it’s good - I love this game - but my recommendation must be taken with a grain of salt because unless you were/are a fan of the Back To The Future franchise, I don’t think there is that much here for someone just looking for a great Point & Click.","October 3, 2014","true","2.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I really like the Back To The Future trilogy and this game certainly feels like a part of the franchise, but while the voice acting and presentation is great, the game itself isn't.\n\nThe presentation of the game is really great. Animation and design of the characters feel like a well done 3D cartoon version of the original cast. The voice actor for Marty is very close to Micheal J. Fox and you won't feel a difference most of the time.\n\nThe story starts out interesting and the first two episodes get you hooked to the setting. Sadly this stops working during the third episode where events just become a bit too convoluted and the story grinds to a repetitive halt. I can see what they were going for and while the idea isn't terrible, it's not executed very well in this game.\n\nSo far I would recommend the game as a whole, but sadly the most important aspect of a game is the one that doesn't work here at all: game play. There's a good amount of inventory and dialogue based puzzles in here and théy aren't too bad, but sometimes feel like a lot of busy work and/or guessing. The main problem with the game play are the sequences in which you have to do certain things in the right order to get past it. There are too many of those scenes and they are not fun to play at all. Most of the time you'll end up just trying everything until something finally works, but it never feels satisfying to find the right solution.\n\nOverall it's a close call and I certainly would rather give it a neutral rating if Steam had that option. It's not a bad game and if you like the story it might be well worth your time. For me it was just slightly not entertaining enough, so I'll give a thumbs down. By all means pick it up on sale and try it for yourself :)","May 6","false","2.9"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","3"

All 5 chapters together make for a fairly long story, it's interesting, but theres also a lot of walking around and not a lot of doing for a large part of the game. As a puzzler point and click title I feel like I should be solving puzzles, but a lot of the time I felt as though I was running errands and just going back and forth between them, rather than reaching an end goal?\n\nMy advice, if your a huge fan of the films, you will find time for this, if you want to play something similar but gets you a bang for your buck - Walking Dead. No two ways about it.\n\nAlso as a short point - voice acting is insanely good for this, but the characters are horrendously unlikeable. I know thats what they're going for, but I just found them grating on me more than they should.\n\nAnywhere between £5 -> £12 would be appropriate to me. Full price is a bit steep in my opinion.\n\nNotes\nNo Steam Achievements, No Trading Cards, Controller Support - but only fully integrated in later episodes.","November 25, 2013","true","4.7"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

Graphics aren't the best, but they suit the art style.  Animations can be a little rough.  Voice acting on the other hand is fantastic.  They got Christopher Lloyd from the movies to voice the Doc.  They weren't able to get Michael J. Fox, but the voice they got is so good, that he does a more convincing young Marty McFly than the original actor could.  Michael J. Fox does make a cameo in the final episode though.\n\nI was a little disappointed that there weren't more locations and eras visited, but considering that this is really one big story carved up into five episodes, it makes sense.  There are a few dull spots, but by episode 3, they kick it up a notch and it keeps you playing.  The series ends well, but I think more episodes will be coming.

But the animations were very much so not as well done as Tales from the Borderlands but that doesnt make it any less of an entertaining game.\n\nAlso there were around 5 or 6 audio files that were completely missing from the game throughout all 5 parts of the game, such as a line of speech mostly from the AI characters side rather than Marty (You). In Part 3 i think it was, there was a scene in a bar where you can choose to play music and one of the selections was completely audio mute. Having said that again it didnt really affect the gameplay very much except as im sure if you had subtitles on you would still be able to read what it was that characters said. (Assuming the audio issues are not fixed since i have just finished playing the game first time Dec 2014 and the final part to the game was released in June 2011)\n\nGood Points\n\nI have only played through the game once at this point so i spent alot of time talking to every single person and looking / touching everything to get a tonne of information for the puzzles so it took around 2-3 hours per part of the game (5 parts to the game) but i had a huge amount of fun doing so and hearing the backstory and indications to the films too.\n\nI did find some of the puzzles kind of hard to work out at first and needed to use some of the hints that you get which generally offered between 2 and 4 hints depending on the difficulty of the puzzle i assume. But once i realized that most of it was kind of obvious when you step back and think about it i didnt need the hints as much and it was really fun working out what to do.\n\nThe story was also really interesting, it didnt follow the films but seemed to suggest that the films had already happened according to some of the dialogue but it just added to the surprise and fun of the game which kept me interested in playing.\n\nI will be playing through this game for at least a second time too so i definitely recommend it especially since its super cheap during Steam Winter Sale 2014  - £4.74.\n\nOne last thing for those that are interested, the game has no achievements and has no steam trading cards / badges just so you know.

Even though the first two episodes start off a bit slow you grow to love the characters and their interactions with each other. There were some tough puzzles and once or twice I needed to utilize the hint system to figure them out but nothing brain scratching or exceptionally challenging.\n\nWhat would have been nice is if there were slightly different branching to the story, like in The Walking Dead. None of your actions carry to the other episodes and when you think you can do something different or get a different reaction with your choice the game just forces you to choose the "correct one".  Excellent that they could bring some of the voice actors from the movie. Even the new guy doing Marty was good. But overall this was a cool adventure that I enjoyed until the end and left me eager for more if they ever decide to make a sequel.","August 1, 2013","true","3.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/31290/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4393 products in account","Back to the Future: The Game is a humorous (move&)point&click adventure game in which you take control of Marty McFly, who has to go back in time to save Doc from early demise. In so doing the timestream pretty much gets wrecked up and Marty has to fix things in several places (and times) to restore the original timeline. Actually, if it wasn't obvious: the game makes so many references to the Back to the Future movies that I'd pretty much make it a prerequisite to have watched them to appreciate all the details and humour.\n\nIt has been separated into 5 parts, all of which take some 2-4 hours of play depending on your urge to explore and how swift you're at completing puzzles (I reckon there are no truly difficult ones anyway). Gameplay is at times weak, for the camera moves and changes directions often, which results in the movement requiring some time to get used to. There are sound glitches in some places and fire glow sometimes stays burning despite the consumable disappearing. One could also speak to an invisible character inside a phone booth. These glitches were in times amusing and sometimes annoying but nothing gamebreaking. After all, several original actors from the movies make a comeback (especially Doc), and the most important factor, the story, is true to the movies.\n\nThere are car chases, crazy science experiments, made-up-names for time travellers, ridiculous escape schemes and of course the-ever-so-present danger of changing the timestream. The story flows seamlessly, and whenever you got stuck, you can always check your present goal and, if you'd like, get a hint within the game on how to advance further. Tension and surprise is maintained well until the end. All in all this game is a very nice sequel to the movies.","October 12, 2013","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As an adventure game, the puzzles are overly simplistic and, at times, borderline tedious. If that's the only thing you're looking for, there's better fare out there, much of it from Telltale.\n\n2. As a BTTF story--Telltale *nails* it. Boy do they ever nail it.\n\nIgnore the reviews griping about 'uneven' tone and the slow first chapter (yes, both of those are true--and also largely irrelevant). The game not only perfectly captures the friendship/relationship between Marty and Doc--it actually, and this is remarkable, develops and furthers the complexities of that relationship; shows a deep understanding of the character of Hill Valley and its inhabitants (an underappreciated quality of the film--like Batman's Gotham City or Blade Runner's Los Angeles, Hill Valley is almost a character in and of itself); provides a delightfully entertaining backstory to Doctor Brown's origins as a scientist; and ultimatelyquestions what underlies the supposed 'moral imperative' Marty has in changing people's futures to begin with (for those who don't study film/literature, this is the actual 'point' of a certain other starring character's inclusion).\n\nThe voice work is spot-on--I was worried about the substitution of A.J Locascio for Marty McFly's voice, but it's well done throughout--Christopher Lloyd sounds terrific for his age--and Michael J. Fox himself makes an appropriate cameo in the final episode.\n\nAnd that final episode ios great--it leaves you with the same warm feeling inside that the films end on, as the friendship between Marty and Doc has grown yet stronger and ever more meaningful through their interactions with each other's lives.\n\nPlay it for the story, as opposed to the 'game'.

As a whole, the BttF game is great. Episode 1... is not.\n\nThere are many problems. Generally related to bugs. I experienced them constantly in episode one. (Luckily none of these appear in the other episodes!) I have a lot of complaints. That will be the focus of this review. However, I still recommend the game as it has a great deal of entertainment value.\n\nOften I would be unable to click on certain people or objects. The game would randomly decide I hadn't clicked on what I clearly did click upon. Instead, it would pick a random clickable person/object instead. Sometimes mouseover caused odd results. The pop-up text (on-screen description) would rapidly flash between what was highlighted by the cursor, and a nearby object.\n\nThe dialog trees are all messed up. It seems like a part of the story was removed... or maybe it's just bugged. I'm not sure. I would frequently find that the dialog I was part of was way ahead of the story. Events (cutscenes) were always in order. The dialog rarely was.\n\nThe story itself, is good. It is very much a BttF-style story. The character models were given a distinctly cartoony appearance. There is also a lot of adult humor. (The kind you should expect based on the film series.) This is sharply contrasted with the fact that the characters look like they originated in a modern animated film. (See: The Incredibles, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Frozen, etc.) They kind-of look like anime versions of the real-life actors of 'Back to The Future'.\n\nThe mouse controls are poor. You have to hold Left-Mouse-Button(LMB), then drag to make your character walk. If you want to run, you have to hold RMB. However, if you hold RMB before you hold LMB, then you don't run. I can use the keyboard to walk, but I'm not sure how to run. Which means I'm stuck using the mouse for just about everything in this game.\n\nProbably the most disappointing thing is that animation was reused from the 'Sam & Max' games. Marty walks with the exact same motions as Sam. When people are talking, their mannerisms will follow the same patterns used in 'Sam & Max'.\n\nLastly I want to mention that if you have a Nvidia card, you'll need to turn on 'Antialiasing - Transparancy'. If you don't, the shadows will look terrible. Personally, I find them so bad that it distracts me from the game. Then again... it might just be my particular video card.

I feel like it's solidly representative of pre-Walking Dead Telltale- kind of a mediocre-to-good game that never really impresses. It's a 5 episode series, about 10-12 hours in length. It's a point and click adventure game with some QTE-ish action sequences sprinkled around. It's never really challenging but sometimes interesting.\n\nThe plot's decent, typical hop-around-in-time BTTF faire, but they manage to make the gameplay pretty samey despite the time difference. The high point is probably the whole dystopian-future Citizen Brown plot, which is a pretty decent departure from the tone of the series. Maybe that's why it works.\n\nThe music is great, of course, it's the BTTF soundtrack, but it really starts to wear out its welcome the 20th time you hear the main theme or "back.. in.. time.." They managed to find a voice actor who can do a pretty passable Marty, even.\n\nThe game's loaded with fanservice, so I'd say that if you're a fan of BTTF it's easily worth a play, and that you might not enjoy it very much if you aren't. The gameplay isn't that great to carry interest beyond that.","October 19, 2014","true","2.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Do you have no concept of time?\n\nTwenty years! Twenty years we'd waited to find out what happened to Marty after events in final instalment of the Back to the Future Trilogy.\nAnd then, finally, Tell Tale stepped into the breach to satisfy our craving with their 5 part episodic adventure,  Back to the Future:  The Game.\nBut was it worth the wait or should the franchise have remained a fond memory, unsullied by this digital resurrection?\n\nI saw it on a re-run\n\nWhen you fire up episode one, the aptly titled "It's About Time" , You'll find yourself (Marty) standing in the familiar Twin Pines Mall Parking Lot with Doc and Einstein.\nThe Delorean is hooked up to a remote control, It's nearly 1:21 AM, October 26th 1985 and Einstein is about to become the worlds first time traveller.\nThe recreation of this scene from the first movie does an excellent job of sucking your right into the Back to the Future universe. You'll find yourself quoting the lines from the movie, comfortable that you've been here before and you know what is coming next...\n\nAre you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a Delorean?\n\nIt's here that the story throws its first curveball.\nThings don't pan out the way you expected, and its at this point that you know it's not just the nostalgia that's keeping that big grin on your face. This isn't just a trip down memory lane, This is Back to the future 4!\nWhatever you've got to tell me, I'll find out through the natural course of time.\nThe "Present Day" Time line in the game takes place in 1986, a few months after the end of the final movie in the trilogy, although it won't be long before the game has you heading back in time to help Doc out.\nLet me say now that, for the most part, the story in this game is excellent. It may get a little silly towards the end, but then you'll be so invested that it just won't matter!\nIn the spirit of avoiding spoilers, I'm not going to cover any of the story in this review, but I will say that if you enjoyed the movies, you will enjoy the twisted, rollercoaster of a narrative that awaits you here.\n\n\nI didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.\n\nSo we know we know there's a cracking story waiting for you here, but how does it look?\nIt looks just fine.\nReleased at the end of 2010, the graphics show their age a little, but they're perfectly serviceable.\nThe characters we know and love are all instantly recognisable and their facial expressions are spot on.  As I said, it looks just fine.\n\nRonald Reagan? The actor?\n\nThe voice acting here is of the highest quality.\nChristopher Lloyd reprises his role as Dr Emmett Brown and whilst Michael J Fox doesn't provide the voice for Marty McFly in the game, A.J. Locascio, the actor who fills his vocal shoes, does an outstanding job of sounding every bit the Marty McFly we know from the movies.\nThe superb Michael J Fox, does make a cameo appearance later in the game, providing voices for past and future McFlys.\nThe musical score is also true to the movies, I defy any Back to The future  fan not to be swept up in the atmosphere of the game when the theme start playing.\n\nMaybe you were adopted.\n\nSo this is a Tell Tale game, should we expect a quick time event extravaganza like the disappointing  Jurassic ?\nThankfully No. Back to the future s game play is a pleasing mix of puzzles , searching for items and picking your way through the snappily written and often funny dialogue options.\n\nIf you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything\n\nThe writing is witty, the atmosphere is spot on and the continuation of the story is worth the price tag alone.\nIf you're a fan of the franchise, then you owe it to yourself to play this game.\nIf you haven't seen the movies (shame on you) then you should go and watch them first, go on... "make like a tree and get out of here!"\n\nWhilst some chapters play out better than others and the ending is a little "silly" I still have no hesitation in recommending Back To The Future: The Game.\n\n\n( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/  )","August 30, 2014","true","4.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

At times the puzzles were too simple and at other times the solutions to the puzzles were pretty obscure. The story was fun but the overuse of the “hey look over there!” trope was annoying(although it did allow for some pretty funny meta humor towards the end of the game.) What I really didn’t care for is that you visit the same town multiple times and only once is there any major difference in architecture(minus the very brief trip to the 1800’s.) With a time travel plot line you can do a lot of things, why confine yourself to one place and time period.

It's half and half point-and-click asking/answering questions, and running around solving puzzles (which actually can be fairly challenging if you choose not to use clues). So I recommend it especially if you're a BTTF fan.","July 9, 2011","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its hard to really say to much about the game without giving anything away. So all I have to say is this is a must play for anyone who liked the movies. Cameos from the movies right up to the end. Voices that you'll remember from the movies, and a story line that may be the best one so far. I have only one bad thing I can say and it may have been more my fault for being impatient.

I have played through all 3 seasons of Telltale's Sam & Max games, so BTTF: The Game felt like familiar territory. So far, I have completed the first 2 episodes of this point-and-click adventure series, and I have enjoyed them. The story is well written, picking up where the movie triology left off, and feels like it fits quite naturally with the movie story line. The plotline is very much in line with the movies, where time travel inadvertently, and disastrously, messes up the time line, which then needs fixing. This time, Marty and Doc need to visit Prohibition-era Hill Valley to fix history. The voice acting is pretty good and the actor portraying Marty does a pretty good Michael J. Fox impression.\n\nNow on to my gripes...the puzzles are very sensical but they are almost too easy; at times it's almost spelled out for you what you need to do. So far I haven't needed to use the game's built in hint system. Next, the navigation in the game's quasi-3D environments is frustrating. Getting Marty to negotiate his way around the scenery is clunky. This game has the same annoying navigation that was introduced in the last season of the Sam and Max games.\n\nOther than those 2 gripes, these games are enjoyable for BTTF fans who want more stories with the characters they love and who, are interested in exploring more lore about Hill Valley, the McFlys, and the Tannens. Oh, we also get to see Doc when he was much younger.","February 7","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The plot across the five episode are well thought out. Marty travels to 1931 to find Doc, who has disappeared and is delcared dead in 1986. The main events of the game take place in alternate time period of 1931 and 1986 while also unraveling mysters of Hill Valley. And in the end, everything is actually tied up, from Edna and Tannen to discovering who Trixie Trotter really is and meating Marty's ancestors. The game does leave an ambiguity for a possible second season that Telltale haven't opened up about....yet.\n\nThe graphics are pretty standard for Telltale, a soft textures and average polygon models that sometimes look a little off. It does give a vibe of adventure in the style of how the characters were modeled though, I really like how Marty and Doc turned out.\n\nMusic and audio are great, nothing too special about them though.\n\nOverall, this serves as a great add-on to the films and are just as scientific with theories new and old.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/something_random/recommended/31290/","something_random","jimmy jimmyson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/something_random/","368 products in account","Apparently, from what I hear from other fellow "reviewers", this is one of those Telltale games before the heavy-hitters like "The Walking Dead" and "The Wolf Among Us", and as such, you would expect certain nuances of this game, contextual to its development, compared to the general expectations these days.\n\nHaving said that, I'm not a big graphics man, and I generally don't expect too much when it comes to these point-and-click adventure games. But it's Back to the Future! Made by Telltale! And has Doc's original actor (Christopher Lloyd, from what I recall)! So what's not to love? Unless you're not a BTTF fan, or just hate the game in general.\n\nThe premise of the game is to explore Doc's disappearance, requiring you to go back in time and find him in some time in the past. From there, the plot kind of goes in some strange but enjoyable turn of events, thus propelling your role to fix up time paradoxes and whatnot, so the future normalises itself.\nSo plot-wise, the game seems to make sense mostly. Characters aren't too detailed, but you can make sense of what they're like, which is important in some parts of the episodes. But the plot starts to get interesting from Episode 3 onwards, especially that part where you have to mess up young Doc's love life.\n\nControls can get a bit weird with the camera panning around sometimes, so you might find the down button moves you left, and some others unusual orientation of movements.\nNow, I played the "Wallace and Gromit" games (were they made by Telltale as well?), and what I mainly don't like in these episodes is the item panel system.\nIn "Wallace and Gromit", you'd just right click to bring up your items and pick something out. Here, you have to click on the item icon, pick your item, and if you need to pick out another item, you have to do the process again. Sure, you're never really using objects mostly, but it is always nice to hotkey these things.\nAdditionally, some items never actually serve a useful purpose and kind of just loiter around your item space. I guess red herrings are interesting, but if you're stuck in a certain part of the game, you might think these items are useful, but the're not. So be aware of that, but at least they disappear (mostly) in the next episode.\n\nAlso, walking speeds are a bit slow. I found that holding Shift makes you "run", which is just a sped-up animation of Marty with a slight speed increase. In certain areas, you will actually run, and even so, if you phase out of an area, you have to re-hold the Shift key again to "run". A bit of a pain, but it's manageable.\n\nThe puzzles are interesting to solve, like that guitar battle with Leech, the SoupMo guy, where you can't actually beat him in skill, but you have to sabotage his performance and win that way.\nIn some instances, you'll be likely to be in a situation where you're wondering "What do I do now? I've done mostly everything... What am I missing?". Here, hints can come in handy. I've only ever had to use the hints once (mostly due to my adamance of finding the solution myself), but sometimes it can really get to you and make you kinda rage at the game, because you don't know what to do next.\nAnd some instances, you'll actually solve the puzzle using sheer coincidence, where your actions just happpen to fall together into a solution that works out. But mostly, you'll have to recall certain information and use objects to help you coordinate the environment to your will and get things done.\n\nIn terms of play time, each episode took around 2-3 hours each, which equates to about 10-15 hours to finish the series. So if you're a casual player with a few hours to spare, I guess this is one avenue to spend your time on. See what I did there, eh? But $24.99 is a little steep for only 15 hours, I suppose. You might want to wait until this is on special (I got it in a Humble Bundle) or something.\n\nBut in short, I'd give this a 7/10. Not too bad, but still a bit rough around the edges.","April 17, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Since today would be the day to market something like that--and they didn't--I'm guessing that it will never come to Steam.\n\nAll I can say about BTTF is that it's Back to the Future Part 4. Instead of being a movie, you get an old-school adventure game. And even if you do not like Adventure Games or you have never watched a BTTF movie, I would still recommend this game.\n\n(I played this game before watching any of the movies. Also, this was my first TT game and the first Adventure Game I wanted to finish on my own. I loved it.)\n\nI don't feel the need to review Back to the Future as in-depth as Tales from the Borderlands. It's an old-school puzzle game with TellTale's dialogue variation system. That means puzzles, puzzles, puzzles--and no QTEs--only more puzzles and laughs. But if you enjoyed the humor of TFTB, you'll probably enjoy BTTF for what it is as well.\n\nThe puzzles can be a little too cryptic at times, but they have a sense of self-awareness and a sense of direction to keep you from getting completely lost. I still don't think they're all as great as Grim Fandango, but you won't be doing anything absurd like in the old King Quest games.\n\nThe only downsides I should mention, besides you have to install every episode separately and open the next episode as a new program, is that being an earlier TT game the controller is not the best option to play with. Perhaps the Remastered version fixed it, but you should stick with a KB&M.\n\nAlso, don't go in expecting a choice-simulator game like recent TT games. This is a game before The Walking Dead became their new formula.\n\nYou have variations in dialogue, superficial ones, and there is no deviation on your paths. I don't think this is a negative, but it is something people will expect from TT. I prefer BTTF to stay the way as it is as the characters remain consistent. Some characters from the film's cast return to their roles (Christopher Lloyd as Doc) while others have great imitators (David Kaufman as Marty McFly.)\n\nThe first two episodes are a little slow and full of fanservice, but midway into EP 2 and from there-on the game gets really crazy with its time-travel storyline and shows some great character development of its cast. And the ending will leave you in smiles.","October 21, 2015","true","2.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I didnt really enjoy it verry much, and this is not due to the few graphical issues encountered or the awfull controller support. Its a  classic point-and-click adventure, and it picks up shortly after the film trilogy ends, as you play Marty McFly going back in time to 1930s prohibition-era to save Doc from his latest pickle. The game rests on a fun plot and sharp dialogue in a beautifully recreated Hill Valley, with terrific voice acting featuring many from the original cast, yet ultimately, it's sadly let down by lightweight in-game puzzles that lack invention and complexity. My real frustration though is that I'm a  100% sure  that Telltale can do better than this. You can still give it a shot, as i said the game is not horrible, but it is overpriced for sure.

(*Note: Some people have reported sporatic issues of not being able to: ? - move to a certain spot, problem clicking and/or manipulating a certain item/element in the game world, etc. Obviously if this occurs on an object needed to continue the story it would be a major problem. ~ I myself have thankfully not encountered any of these issues.)\n\nStory: Here's the kicker for me... I bought this game as a die-hard fan with an open mind of expecting any and everything. (Mild Spoiler Upcoming...) In the first 30 seconds, I thought I was simply going to be replaying the game (it was just the intro... duh xD~) and I was fully satisfied with the thought that I would just be playing out the movies. ~ It's Not. ~ It is a totally unique and original story. There is enough material in this game to write an entire Television Drama series. From the best Sci-Fi that we are all familiar with; Guess what? As George Lucas found out the hard way... It's not the pretty graphics, it's not the 3D interface with a bunch of peripheral toys, it's not the high priced actors and the gorgeous women. What is the 'IT' Factor that makes something so spectacular? It's the writing. Always has been, always will be. And this game HAS IT! =) If the writing sucks, the 'whatever it is' tanks. It's that simple. You can throw all the money in the world at something but if you don't pay someone with a brain five bucks to write a good story, people are going to know it and they are going to know it QUICK. Unfortunately in these days, =) like plutonium, good writers are a 'little hard to come by.' xD~ What is/was a $10 steam sale game; hits upon a Serious IDEA. They only made three movies. This should Really be made into a TV television series drama. (NBC/Universal I'm talking to YOU!) Quantum Leap part 2 so to speak. Guy who bounces through time with his buddy. They already have all of it; it's all on the Paramount lot, even the costumes. It would take nothing more than a producer with the nerve. I'm sure there's a demand. All of the cost is taken care of because the props are all there. It would be... SO EASY it's unbelievable. The only thing they NEED: are Writers. =) So... you heard it here. xD~ To be cliche: Well, here's hoping the idea doesn't magically vanish. At least 'The Future' is: whatever we make it, so we'll have to make it a Good One, ALL of US! ~ Enjoy Life the best you can, wherever you are, because we're all stuck In "Good'Old" Two Thousand and Fifteen.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you don't have B2tF: The Series to watch on NBC...\nthe next best thing is to play "Back to the Future: The GAME"\n\n5 Stars. 10/10. Thumbs Up.\nHighly Recommended.","October 22, 2015","true","6.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

Fox.  To this day, he remains a stalwart celebrity crush of mine.  TellTale's game is a fantastic blend of the movies' humor and drama, and while the puzzles might not fit into a movie, this isn't a movie.  I've not yet finished It's About Time (Episode One), but you can be sure I'll be playing through all five episodes.  I hope to convince my father to play this game as well, as the pace and puzzles are right up his alley; I have fond memories of watching him play point-and-click adventure/puzzle games, and it's been a long time since we've found one worth our time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lufiales/recommended/31290/","lufiales","✪ konbleck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lufiales/","355 products in account","Review for full gameThis game is a good adaptation from the original movies. If you like Telltale's style of games, you will like this game too. The gameplay time is just like the other Telltale games like The Walking Dead, with 2 to 4 hours per chapter (depending on how much time you spend with the provided small exploring or with completing some puzzles).\nThis game has the episodes separated (5 episodes) instead of a combined download with big updates when a new episode come out. I will hide spoilers that I may put in the text to better explain my opinions, so let me put here a ***SPOILER WARNING*** to warn you before reading all my "essay". There's a TL;DR in the end of this review for those who want to go straight to the point instead of reading all this.\n\nReview for Episode 1I was not expecting too much from this game because some friends of mine already played it and they didn't like it much. But I got really surprised because this game was good. Good voice acting and characters. It has good puzzles, but I found one of them really confusing (the puzzle where you are in the lab at young Doc's house and you have to click the things emphasized by what he is saying, without subtitles it can be confusing and frustrating and take you some time to pass). I give it an 7/10.\n\nReview for Episode 2I have one thing to say about this episode for sure: it's way better than the first one. The story got more twists and giving more reasons to play the other episodes. The puzzles are easy and fast to do in this one. And if you have any doubt, just like the first episode, the game can give you hints (in a limited number of times, but it's still helpful). I give it an 8/10.\n\nReview for Episode 3Let's go straight to the point. It's a good episode, well, half of it at least. It's more talking and less action than the previous two. The last puzzle (or if you prefer: interactive sequence) can be a bit frustrating if you don't figure out the solution quick enough). I give it a 6/10.\n\nReview for Episode 4This episode is better than the previous one. It has more action and more development of its story. It has a long lasting puzzle by the middle. If you can't make it at the first try, you will be some time trying to accomplish it. I don't spoil it this time. And this episode has like a bag of feels. It make me feel like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at one point. But all went good to make me want to play more. I give it a 7/10.\n\nReview for Episode 5Well... This final episode may have been the best of all 5 in my opinion. Good puzzles, action, story development, different moments and a kinda intriguing ending. The ending leave in the air the idea that we will have more of this in the future. We'll see. I give it a 8/10.\n\nTL;DRThis is a good game with good puzzles, good story and character development, good action and plot. Of course it has its ups and downs, but this game might be a "should play" for BTTF enthusiasts. I enjoyed it very much and recommend it. My final rating: 8/10.","October 13, 2015","true","15.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you love the 'Back to the Future' franchise, please buy and play this game.\n\nPros: The time and thought that went into the story in many ways surpasses what went into the movies, which were already extremely impressive. The voice acting was top notch with all my respect going out to AJ Locascio's perfect recreation of Micheal J. Fox in the movies. Christopher Lloyd reprising the role of Doc Brown and if you keep an ear out you will notice a cameo or two by mister Fox himself, which was the Icing on the Cake.\n\nCons: Some of the Puzzles are a little overly simplistic and some of the character models just look... weird. Biff is a prime example, also Marty seems to have a very different haircut than the movies.\n\nBut these are minor complaints. On the whole the games are great and very entertaining, I just wish they lasted longer :)","October 17, 2014","true","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

My favorite part is when you're using the sonic screwdriver, and you're all like "ZAP ZAP" and the Cybermen are all electrocuted, and- Wait... This is the Back to the Future game? Why didn't you tell me?\n\nNow don't get me wrong. I LOVE the Back to the Future trilogy. It's literally one of my favorite movie series.\nYet, this game just didn't really stick out to me.\n\n*Pros*: Somewhat interesting story, okay voice acting, kinda funny characters, and simple game mechanics.\n*Cons*: Controls are buggy (Making Marty seem like a bit of a derp...), the camera is spastic, the dialouge can be tedious, and this isn't the game's fault, but more the company who made it. (TellTale games.) No matter what you do, it's just one path. No decisions, nothing. Just walking around... It just gets a bit dull.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't really recommend this game if you're looking for a fun adventure game. If you're a die hard BTTF fan or it's really cheap on Steam, then you should probably get this game. (Provided you don't mind the controls.)\n6.95/10 Stars","March 10","false","1.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","5"

The story goes on and your character moves as per story unfolds. There are only few situation where you get to actually control your character to move around.\n\nHowever, this is more of a story puzzle game, where you actually control your character almost all the time to solve puzzle and then the story moves on to another puzzle. I am at the near end of episode one and I got really bored as I am expecting more of the recent type of game telltales have but sadly it isnt.\n\nSo save your money for other titles if you are looking for the same as what I am looking for.","December 5, 2015","false","3.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This game was very bad and the fact the SPOILERS Edna was the speakeasy artist was a cool idea but WHY IN THE WORLD DID THE GAME DESIGNERS THINK "ooh I know lets get Edna to steal a time machine" This made the fifth game short and boring and unlike the other games which took a total of atleast 3 or 4  hours, apart from the second game "Get Tannen", other a long period of time I was able to complete "Outatime" in 2 and a half hours. This disapointed me ;( but I would still look past that and recommend this series of games to any of my Back to the Future loving friends!!","August 20, 2014","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Now i wished there was 3 options to choose for a review for games such as neutral. there are sometimes where we feel a game was decent but lacked on certain things. for me this is one of them. I enjoyed the voice acting. The story was not too bad.\n\n\nI'm one of those people that came off playing Walking Dead, Wolf among us, Game of Thrones before this game. So i was thinking there would be something similar.  But i tried their game Sam and max before this one so then i realized not all of their games would be like that. First thing that annoyed me was the controls and the camera. this was using a 360 controller. Sometimes it wouldn't react or i couldn't figure out what to use my buttons on. So i would have to actually use my mouse. So that defeated the controller purpose. the game being broken into 5 titles is only a small annoyance.\n\n\nSo i only did complete one chapter atm but im mixed at the game. I'm not sure if this will be one i will finish because of the controls and camera annoying me. Now don't get me wrong if you can get it to work then it might not be so bad. i can't recommend this at full price. bundle or major sale maybe.","May 14","false","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The problem is, overall, the pros don't outway the cons.\n\nAs far as the GOOD things: the story feels very much like a BTTF movie.  Fans of the movies will no doubt love the fact that some of the original voice actors returned.  The story is good, some of the new characters are interesting, and overall, it's entertaining.\n\nNow, why don't I recommend this game?  If you take off the nostalgic glasses and look at it for what it is, it's not that great.  While I said the storyline was good, it's not GREAT, which is what you would hope for from a game based off the iconic movies (which I myself love).  The plot is very linear (there's not much in the way of choice), and the story doesn't get really interesting until much later in the game.  Also, the setting of a prohibition-era Hill Valley just isn't very captivating.\n\nIn addition, the puzzles vary from being either too easy or too vague to get through without hints (the guitar battle is a good example).  Also, and I know this is minor, but the animation is like something out of a kid's cartoon, which contrasts awkwardly with the adult humor and cussing.  There's more I could say, but that would just be rambling.\n\n\nOverall, if you're a big fan of the movies and can get this game on sale, then YES, buy this game!  But if you're an average Joe looking for a game as good as their later efforts (The Walking Dead; Wolf Among Us), you'll be disappointed.

I'd grab it on sale merely for this purpose. If you're looking for a remarkable game and have no designs on the movies, don't waste your time.\n\nThe game opens with familiarity. Doc is testing his time machine then something goes awry. Lo and behold the true story begins. Now you're in the mix and you're in point and click mode, which is the only good part about the controls to this game. Once you have to navigate off screen, you're forced to click, hold and drag to move your character. After my play through, I went back and tried asdw and the arrow keys to move and it worked. Something not explained through regular gameplay, but I digress. The puzzles aren't inherently hard. With enough dialogue and random clicking, you can figure out most of them without a hint.\n\nThe first episode brings you back to the movies. The second lingers on the same familiarity. By the third episode, I wanted to rush through just to beat the game. The fourth pulls you back in a bit and finally, when you know it's finishing up, the fifth brings you back to feels. Until the end, when it drags feet again, but it's okay because it will wrap up soon, the Delorean will drive into the screen and you will wish you could have it back all over again. The episodes don't link from your gameplay so items you collected do not transfer and neither do your choices. No matter what you name yourself in the first game, your name will be changed in the following.\n\nSpeaking of episodes, who's idea was it to make you buy a game then repeatedly buy the same game multiple times. Well, it's not an entirely new concept, DLC has been going on for a few years now to rehash old sh**, but for this type of game? I'm not quite sure how much they forced you into spending in the long run, as I bought the game with all the episodes on sale for $4.99, but come on. The listing price was $19.99 and for the life of me I can't possibly think of how it could have been sold for more than $5.00. I spent about 2 hours per episode, with the exception of episode 3 where I walked away to eat and bullsh** for a while bringing my total to around 6 hours.\n\nEdna and young doc, separately and together, annoyed the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. The dialogue wasn't completely terrible, but I'm not sure as to why there were so many Star Wars references thrown in. There were also quite a few glitches in the episodes which made dialogue and entire scenese skip.\n\nAll in all, I'd say for the $5 it's worth the nostalgia, but the game as a whole is doodoo.\n\nGood luck!","December 27, 2015","false","2.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I forgot I had it open! Anyway, I'd say the total game time for one episode was right around 2 hours. This is an older episode game from Telltale and it does show, to a degree. The Telltale engine works well and it has carried them on through recent releases, and it holds up rather well in that respect. In this, you can set your expectation to what you would (in terms of graphics) for a game released around this time - it looks pretty good, but certainly not what we expect in 2014, but still fun to look at! Some things haven't held up this well, at all.\n\nThe good and the bad are in equal supply with this, I think it looks adorable and the characters and voice acting are fantastic. Telltale really has a talent for making things like Back To The Future, The Wolf Among Us, The Walking Dead, etc., really come to life and be fun again. The light touchings of "pick your own adventure" stylings were already perfected in that "Telltale Games" way, even when this came out.\n\nThe biggest negative to this I have to give to the controls. They're clumsy. Extremely clumsy, and this has been fixed to a degree in recent releases, but it's probably my biggest complaint with any of their games.\n\nI'm sure if this were early 2010 and I were playing this, my complaint would be the same with the wonky controls, but I'd probably think the graphics were better by comparison, but we've all become a bit spoiled. I didn't experience any problems with gameplay whatsoever, and again, the overall feel and fun-factor of the game (this episode, anyway) is huge. Finally, the graphics, even if dated, are lots of fun to look at and very adorable.\n\nEverything considered, 7.0/10 - As with a lot of this type, pick up the whole series on a sale or get it as a gift (like I did! :D: ) and you'll have tons of fun with it. I'm likely to play through it again, but replayability is most definitely limited.

If you're expecting to hear that line somewhere in this game, prepare for disappointment.  While the game starts off with you in the shoes of Marty McFly, you're soon transported to a parallel dimension where a bunch of kids are trying to blow up nuclear reactors as part of an eco-terrorist cell.  After you blow up a bunch of innocent civilians you get out of town and team up with a talking dog and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, then fight Biff Tannen as he attempts to summon a meteor to destroy all of Hyrule.  I thought the writing was okay but there were a few lines like "this guy are sick" that really stood out as evidence that the translators Atlus hired were probably not paid very well.

There were times when you could see the characters clipping.  At the end of the final episode, theres a rare point when there is a bug not allowing you to beat the game because you need to get something out of your inventory. As much as I hate to put it on a negative, there were just too many things that could bug a fellow game dev. My tip, if this is your first Tell Tale game you are planning to purchase, just don't. It will give you a bad idea on the entire company and they are awesome.

It has everything going for it, the music straight from the movie, the nostalgia, the amazing voice cast and the immersion that lets you explore a lot from the movie. This is some good interactive fiction and a point and click was the way to go to tell a story. The only real problem here is the genre just isn't all that fun.\n\nThe story has you going back in time as Marty McFly from the movies to find Doc Brown and really puts a focus on Doc's youth instead of the movies that put the focus on Marty's family and him saving it. Most of the characters are here from the movie, Marty, his dad George McFly, Doc Brown, Einstein the dog and of course Biff Tannen. It introduces more characters, but they're not the stars. Biff's voice actor could have sounded more like Biff, but Marty's voice actor is fantastic and Doc is played by Christopher Lloyd as always.\n\nSince this is a modern point and click game that lets you walk around an area instead of being confined to one screen like the older version of the genre. You'll be able to collect items and use them. That's one of the problems, the tedium of using the items. Going into the item menu, selecting the item, using the item and if you fail then you need to do it all over again. Over and over. , You'll be figuring out what dialog choice you need to make, which character to distract so you can do something with them gone. At least with this and other modern point and click games they accentuate what to click on.\n\nI can't say the game is fun and to be honest it feels like a chore to sit through the story. There aren't any crazy moments like in the movie so much as dialog and wandering around. I can't imagine non gamers that are fans of the movie franchise sitting down to enjoy this game and play it all the way through. I can't imagine gamers saying wow that was fun, unless this was the 90s when point and click games were more accepted, before technology left them behind.\n\nFor the most part, the game is a series of cut scenes to say even the simplest of things. Potentially over and over again. There is some interactivity when you chat with someone, but it feels more like how much flavor dialog do you want to hear? There is always a logical choice with dialog and there are no wrong choices, so much as do you want to listen to all 3 - 5 responses or pick the most logical one to get it over with and progress? There are no real consequences like in Walking Dead where it can change characters and or events. You'll always get through the game. There is no death, there is no failure, there is just pressing on until you figure out what to do next.\n\nI've always been a big fan of the Back to the Future movie franchise, and I really enjoyed my first play through of Walking Dead, which is also from Telltale Games, but this game is a chore. The story and the nostalgia just aren't enough to make me want to see what happens next.","August 6, 2014","false","3.6"," 32 of 70 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","32","70","0","0"

How could a Telltale game about Back to the Future go wrong? Easy, by not being a Telltale game to begin with. I dont know if they outsourced this game, or if the art department took the day off and left it to the interns but wow... this game is ugly. The lip syching is awful, and the characters faces lack the complexity to properly emote.\n\nBut how does it play? Again... nothing like a Telltale game. Instead of a story on rails where you get to occassionally switch tracks to fit your preference, Back to the Future is a point and click puzzle game... do you know how unexciting it is to play a puzzle game coop? The story moves like molassus because your constantly moving back and forth, reading the same dialogue, trying to figure out what item you need, or what line of dialogue will reveal the clue. The pacing was so bad me and my friend quit before chapter 2 was even finished because it was soooo slow.\n\nIn short, this is a slow, point and click puzzle game, NOT a typical Telltale game... because those are entertaining, this game is not.","December 30, 2015","false","2.0"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

I was thrilled when this game came out and I finally was able to buy it. When we arrive at this point I have to admit that I like almost anything BTTF related, even the animated series. But this game... This game makes me angry. I've played two other games by telltale and I quite love it, but this game is outrageous.\n\nThere is not difficulty on this, in every location you have normally three/four things to interact with, you don't carry many objects with you (you can count it with your hand's fingers) and any conversation eventually leads with what the developers want to. You can't get lost somewhere because there's so little things to do and so little things to talk about that there is literally NO WAY to miss something. What I hated the most were the conversations where you had three options but the three of them where basically the same. What's the point then?\n\nSo the interesting thing about this game is not playing it but watching it and see how the story goes and... Nope. The story is just not worth it, really simple and plain, full of plot holes and the graphics don't help. They're good enough to be bad and get you out of focus.\n\nThe gameplay is quite tedious, if you walk from one point to another in some chapters you will cross with somebody and you'll have to watch that terrible animation with that same face with the nodding that EVERY CHARACTER will do. The movement is not the best thing in the world to be honest.\n\nBasically this game consists in clicking two things to see the next animation. Kind of LA Noire but with worse graphics and even worse gameplay.\n\nThe only good thing I have to say about this is that this game came out 5 years ago. They released after that Jurassic Park and The Walking Dead and they clearly improved so hey, let's just consider it just a big mistake (praised by the critics and the gamers, I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY).\n\nMy veredict: Sadly disappointing.","September 30, 2015","false","2.5"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","9","23","0","0"

It lacks the polish or atmosphere of TellTale's effort with The Walking Dead.\n\nThe Walking Dead plays out like a well-done effort by a developer's first team based on a popular franchise in a very popular genre while BttF:TG plays like a rushed effort by a developer's second or third team based upon a franchise that was huge 30 years ago in a genre that has outgrown its boyish charm.\n\ntl;dr My Steam library is bloated and neglected but I like the vast majority of what is there.

Now its up to you to change his fate, but as we learned from the movies, screwing with the past mucks up the future. The goal is to make sure the Hill Valley of 1986 is just how Marty left it.\nTelltale fail miserably at making their own circa 1931 Hill Valley anything more than a studio lot full of comedy gangsters.\nThe gameplay is traditional adventure stuff. You walk around as Marty, talk to citizens and use items to solve puzzles. Unfortunately the puzzles are very easy, uninspired and boring.\nThe characters are just as bland, also most of the characters are cardboard nobodies. At least, in some cases, the acting is good. On the most basic level, the actors sound like the original characters.\nThe graphics do not render smoothly and the worst part is that these tech problems distract from the cinematic gameplay.\nThe sounds of the game are pretty decent. Music is mostly in the background and not too distracting and actual sound effects also take a backseat in favour of the voice acting. The voice acting is definitely the best part in the game.\nIf you are a big fan of the movies, then you could think about getting Back to the Fute: The Game.

Alot...sound randomly drops out or amplifies sometimes the cut scenes will glitch through buildings leaving you watching a black screen while they just talk very very slowly...on at least 3 occassions the game completely bricked and wouldnt let me quit so I had to force my computer off and back on again.\n\nthe first part came out in 2009 with the rest coming out in 2010...and the graphics...are not great. I wasnt expecting cinematic graphics for a 5-6 year old game...but the graphics are on a par if not marginally better than Late PS2/Very very early PS3 graphics...they all have flappy mouths as well rather than synching the dialogue so sometimes cut scenes just end with a load of flappy heads...I only point out the graphics because the likes of Fallout 3 came out between 2007-2011 and are utterly astounding in terms of quality against this...\n\nThe only good things I can say about it is the plot itself isnt terrible. Its got quite a back to the future  "feel" but it does come across as boarder fanfic at times (Making up "mary sue" characters and making the heros almost untouchable in terms of having any bad attributes) and that Martys soundalike is really quite good...Doc sounds good...everyone else sounds iffy...\n\nI Payed a £5 for all 5 parts of the game during the summer sale and for a pound a part I'd say it was alright...but avoid paying full price at all costs...Its really not worth it. 4/10","July 26, 2015","false","2.4"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","3","11","0","0"

I just bought the whole collection. Now let me start off with this: I have never been an adventure game fan. This is why I have stayed away from Telltale games. However, hearing just wonderful, awesome, best game ever reviews I finally let my guard down and purchaseed THEM ALL! Here is my verdict so far.\n\nTL;DR - Adventure game still aren't for me.\n\nWow, that was a really easy, yet expensive lesson, for me to learn. In a FPS if I shoot someone, they die. If I shoot their arm, they die. If I shoot their face, they die. If I shoot their leg... you get the picture right? Of course you do, you've played FPS b4. Adventure games suffer from constantly having to do exactly what someone decided was the right thing always and conforming your mind to be set completely in track with that person's idea of mindset.\n\nBasically, in adventure games, if I shoot your leg first, but the programer thought I would aim for the arm, they do not die. If I shoot the arm, but there was a hint to shoot the face, then leg, then face, then arm, they do not die. You see why I do not like adventure games? I can't just play them. I have to spend hours figuring out every nuance that some other geek decided was the right way.\n\nBttF is no different. 1.5 hours in and I'm just clicking on every highlighted item, in a static world, wondering what logic the programer decided would work to make a damn barrel of alchohol fall from a shelf.

By the 3rd episode I just kind of wanted to get it over with, not even making an effort to solve the puzzles and just using the hint system to tell me how to solve everything.  I enjoy Telltale Games, especially Sam and Max, and thought that this was a major disappointment.  Again, it's major problem is its length.  If they had stopped at episode 2, this would have been a more enjoyable overall product.","April 8, 2013","false",""," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

Even if this game has an interesting story from a great movie, it has a GAME-BREAKING BUG in the first episode. I read that if you don't do exactly like they programmed it, you won't trigger an important cutscene and you won't be able to hit the pipe in the soup store ...\n\nI lost about 30 minutes trying everything and nothing ever happened. I had to trigger a certain conversation with the bad guy but since I already talked to him, I can't talk to him about the thing that i need to ...

I love Telltale, I love point-and-click adventures, I LOVE Back to the Future. What could go wrong?\n\nAnswer: A lot, apparently.\n\nAs later chapters were released, the somewhat thin layer of polish that came from the first few chapters very quickly peeled away. Events happened in the wrong order, characters would suddenly pop into scenes they weren't in before. Voice acting would randomly cut out in the middle of a line. The crowning achievement was during a car chase scene, when you could clearly see some sort of editor handle bouncing around behind the vehicle.\n\nThe game ends with the tease of a sequel, and I honestly kind of hope that it doesn't get one.","September 23, 2015","false","2.9"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Although you can see that Telltale Games put a lot of effort into this project (voices, music, design...), it certainly does not compare to their newer games. There were some episodes where I really had to force myself not to quit because the story was pretty mediocre and the tasks were boring. Episode 3 (Citizen Brown) was probably the best episode of this series.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with this game are the bugs, particularly in episode 5. Pretty much at the beginning, in the Glass House, I managed to encouter two game-breaking bugs, which meant I had to do everything all over - twice. That sucked... Plus, the German language version has some serious dubbing problems, i.e. sentences get cut off suddenly, and some sentences haven't been translated at all. Is this a big deal? Yes, if you pay 23 bucks, it certainly is.\n\nFans of the franchise, however, might want to take a look at this game, if it's on sale.","September 26, 2015","false","4.0"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

The conversation between Marty McFly and 'Doc' Brown seems very familiar but something isn't quite right. And it ends up with our time travelling heroes getting stuck in Prohibition Era Hill Valley. Along the way they meet Marty's grandfather Arty, Principal Strickland's aunt, and a 17 year old Emmett Brown. The game is presented with lovely looking 3D cartoon graphics and a voice cast including Christopher Lloyd reprising his role as Doc Brown. The actor playing Marty totally nails the teenage Michael J. Fox voice too! The story is supervised by Bob Gale who co-wrote the films with Bob Zemeckis and, you know, it really does come off in the spirit of the films. (If perhaps on the fan service side of things.)\n\nThe game plays out like most point-and-click adventure games. You move Marty around the environment and interact with specific elements or characters to move the story along. The philosophy for the game seems to be that the story is important above everything. In this regard, the puzzles are never overly difficult or distracting from the story. The player is never penalised for their actions which means you are free to go through all the character responses which are often amusing. To this end, Back to the Future: The Game ends up being a bit more interactive fiction than a game as such. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. The story and acting are engaging and you find that you want to move along as well.\n\nPlaying the game isn't very different to many adventure games. I've always found the genre a bit clunky to move around in and while the developers at Telltale Games add a bit of polish to make the controls a bit forgiving, I find it's really an endemic fault of the genre. I was extremely pleased to find that there was gamepad support for the game and I could take advantage of Big Picture Mode. The gamepad is usable, and I used it for about half of the game, but it is also quite clunky to use.\n\nProbably the only thing that really bothered me about the game were the few intense scenes where the music swells up and scene gets busy. There is a sense of urgency in the scenario but because the adventure game is to some degree turn based it's difficult to satisfy that urgency. It becomes a little frustrating and you kind of want to turn all the sound off so you can concentrate on the puzzle you're supposed to be solving.\n\nOtherwise Back to the Future: The Game, Episode One is a delightful little game and I look forward to playing the subsequent instalments.","February 26, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is obviously created with a lot of love and zeal for the series and all of the episodes were thoroughly enjoyable to the point where I did not want them to end. Took 2 hours to complete each episode so you can think of them as 5 brand new plots to add to the original three and they interweave fantastically as well as exploring some interesting new concepts for Marty and Doc to explore, Overall I would give the series as a whole a solid 9.5/10 for a fan of BTTF as it really captures the spirit of the films and has a wonderful art style whilst remaining really undemanding on the hardware seeing as how my laptop could run it at 4k with no dips from 60fps.","February 27, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found the animation to have resemblences and similarities in cartoonish/comic book style to some of the later games. The dialog is a bit more basic than Walking Dead etc, in regards to the responsive and consequences in the situation. The story was flawed in some ways and a little ridiculous in others. It was however enjoyable. The characters had good arcs and grew on you. The light-hearted atmosphere added to the enjoyment and setting the game gave you. The gameplay was sometime a little repetitive but the game/episodes were the right length that it didn't really matter. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys Telltale adventure games, Point and click games, Back to the Future, sci-fi and story based games. 6.5/10","December 27, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It pretty much tells you what to do. It's great if you suck at these games\nStory is pretty good.

The game is split into 5 episodes - It's About Time, Get Tannen, Citizen Brown, Double Visions and OUTATIME, and they are all about two hours long, assuring about 10 hours of gameplay. The story is based around 1931 Hill Valley, where gangsters rule the streets and a 17 year old Emmet Brown is creating his first scientific experiments. The game parodies the " history repeats itself " theme in the trilogy, with some " Hey Mcfly"s, Marty almost being hit by a moving object and horrible nightmares followed by a sudden realisation. A true tribute to the films.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe game follows the point and click genre, as many other Telltale games do. Unfortunately, as an earlier product, the game does not feature Quick Time Events or the fact that choices affect the story. Quite a few fun puzzles, so you'll need to be ready for some brain twisters!\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nPretty good graphics. Less comic book style ( as The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us have) and more realistic looking.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nA good product, but you can get it for a fiver on some sales, such as the BTTF day one I bought this on.\n\n","October 29, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wow, this looks old!\nAfter playing through the whole game I must say it really feels and play like a 10 year old game.\nOverall the game is OK but it feels very old and slow.\nThere are plenty of movie references and it definitely got the Back to the Future atmosphere.\n\nThe voice acting is fine but the graphics are crude and flat. The environment lacks of life and movement.\nThe character control is clunky and together with odd camera angles it makes the game a bit annoying after a while.\nIt’s not a difficult game, the puzzles are fairly easy and quick to solve.\nIf you get stuck there’s a hint system to tell you what to do or point you in the right direction.\n\nThe premise which I recommend it on.\nAt 5-7€ it might be worth a play through if you’re a Back to the Future fan.\nAt 22,99€ - No way!

The storyline can be considered canon considering Bob Gale is on the storyboard, but it doesn't stand up to the story the movies had. There is literally almost no action in the game.

Puzzle difficulty was about right, without making you feel too frustrated. There is also a good ingame hint system so you'll never truly be stuck.\n\nIt has an interesting storyline, and almost feels like it could be made into a fourth film in the franchise. Music is very faithful to the series, and the voice acting is very good. The guy who voice-acted as Marty does a very good impression. The original stars Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd even lends their voices giving it a very authentic feel.\n\nI personally felt that the story was too short as it ended too soon. There is also no replayability value once the game is completed.\n\nOverall Rating: 7.5 / 10\nWell worth to buy for gamers of all ages.

It takes place seven months after the end of the trilogy. This plays into what happens with life after the last movie. Marty is home and Doc is still in the past. Marty, sad at the loss of his friend to time is suddenly interuppted when the DeLorean suddenly appears and Marty is thrust into another adventure.\n\nAppearance: As with many Telltale games this has a cartoon like design. The design is initially off putting with how the movies appear but in no time the art style grows on you. The atmosphere is perfect and captures not only the feel but the over themes of the BTTF movies. This is a perfect continuation.\n\nGameplay: This is a standard point and click adventure. It has a pretty standard 90's P&C feel to it to a fault. It has many of the issues that plagued those games. Issues getting characters to move properly or collision detection. Over all the game feels well done and is really a joy to play.\n\nAchievements: The only achievement this game came with is having a wonderful time playing the game. The story is reward enough for that.\n\nBottom Line: This game is such a great deal of fun I regret not playing it sooner. Not only is it the perfect game for a BTTF fan but its a great point and click adventure. Each episode will run you about 2 hours of gameplay for a total 10 hours of gameplay. I picked this up when it was on sale and I would even go so far as to recommend that its even worth the full price. Pick this up at your next chance and give it a go.","June 12, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You really shouldn't get stuck either if you're an adventure game veteran, the puzzles aren't as obscure as some games' are.\n\nAlso you can pick a pop-culture name a la Clint Eastwood in the first game and have it mentioned a lot over the series.

The conversation between Marty McFly and 'Doc' Brown seems very familiar but something isn't quite right. And it ends up with our time travelling heroes getting stuck in Prohibition Era Hill Valley. Along the way they meet Marty's grandfather Arty, Principal Strickland's aunt, and a 17 year old Emmett Brown. The game is presented with lovely looking 3D cartoon graphics and a voice cast including Christopher Lloyd reprising his role as Doc Brown. The actor playing Marty totally nails the teenage Michael J. Fox voice too! The story is supervised by Bob Gale who co-wrote the films with Bob Zemeckis and, you know, it really does come off in the spirit of the films. (If perhaps on the fan service side of things.)\n\nThe game plays out like most point-and-click adventure games. You move Marty around the environment and interact with specific elements or characters to move the story along. The philosophy for the game seems to be that the story is important above everything. In this regard, the puzzles are never overly difficult or distracting from the story. The player is never penalised for their actions which means you are free to go through all the character responses which are often amusing. To this end, Back to the Future: The Game ends up being a bit more interactive fiction than a game as such. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. The story and acting are engaging and you find that you want to move along as well.\n\nPlaying the game isn't very different to many adventure games. I've always found the genre a bit clunky to move around in and while the developers at Telltale Games add a bit of polish to make the controls a bit forgiving, I find it's really an endemic fault of the genre. I was extremely pleased to find that there was gamepad support for the game and I could take advantage of Big Picture Mode. The gamepad is usable, and I used it for about half of the game, but it is also quite clunky to use.\n\nProbably the only thing that really bothered me about the game were the few intense scenes where the music swells up and scene gets busy. There is a sense of urgency in the scenario but because the adventure game is to some degree turn based it's difficult to satisfy that urgency. It becomes a little frustrating and you kind of want to turn all the sound off so you can concentrate on the puzzle you're supposed to be solving.\n\nOtherwise Back to the Future: The Game, Episode One is a delightful little game and I look forward to playing the subsequent instalments.","February 26, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is really more one of those Click-and-see-if-you're-right games, like the Freedi Fish games I played as a small child. The storyline can be considered canon considering Bob Gale is on the storyboard, but it doesn't stand up to the story the movies had. There is literally almost no action in the game. This might not be so hard to understand, but I've never played a TellTale game before and this might be the norm for their games, but it won't appeal to hardcore gamers, mostly casual,\n\nOverall, an OK game but only reccomended for fans of TellTale and/or Back to the Future. Also, watching the movies is pretty much a necessity.","April 25, 2011","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Even fewer are good after it's been years since the release of the movie. This Game is one of the few good ones. By no means is this the best movie liscensed game but in my honest opinion it still has the ability to stand on it's own. Back to the Future is set after the events of the last film in the franchise and as such there are plenty of references to the original movies. The writing still has charm, yet at certain points the game has a different feel to the story of the films, even if it is the same story line. The sound is somewhat subpar in certain places during the game, but at the very least the original soundtrack returns. At times thought, I felt as though I was playing a game for the 6th generation consoles (wii, ps2, xbox). Indeed, the graphics don't have the best polish however if you don't mind the cartoony stylization of the game it shouldn't bother anyone. The gameplay is your average point and click adventure which works in the games favor because making a fps or third person shooter out of this style of game would have been horendous Overall, as a story that expands the lore of the movies this game is pretty great, but stand alone it just okay. I'd suggest that mainly fans of the franchise play this game.","June 20, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found the animation to have resemblences and similarities in cartoonish/comic book style to some of the later games. The dialog is a bit more basic than Walking Dead etc, in regards to the responsive and consequences in the situation. The story was flawed in some ways and a little ridiculous in others. It was however enjoyable. The characters had good arcs and grew on you. The light-hearted atmosphere added to the enjoyment and setting the game gave you. The gameplay was sometime a little repetitive but the game/episodes were the right length that it didn't really matter.

Puzzle difficulty was about right, without making you feel too frustrated. There is also a good ingame hint system so you'll never truly be stuck.\n\nIt has an interesting storyline, and almost feels like it could be made into a fourth film in the franchise. Music is very faithful to the series, and the voice acting is very good. The guy who voice-acted as Marty does a very good impression. The original stars Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd even lends their voices giving it a very authentic feel.\n\nI personally felt that the story was too short as it ended too soon. There is also no replayability value once the game is completed.\n\nOverall Rating: 7.5 / 10\nWell worth to buy for gamers of all ages.

It was released in conjunction with the 25th anniversary of the first film. Now that the 30th anniversary is behind us, and 2015 came and left, can this game survive on its own merits?\n\nAs a "Back to the Future" game it hits all the right notes. References to the films aren't clustered too close together and surprise you when you least expect them. It feels more like "Back to the Future" than any other game that shared that title before. The characters are familiar and their portrayal in this game feels very authentic. In many ways this game feels like a genuine piece of the film's legacy that had been lost to the ages.\n\nAs a point and click adventure game it is a bit too simple. The puzzles seemed too easy at times and there were very few times when I needed to consult the in game hint box. Every puzzle has an obvious solution and the game's objective reminders guarantees that the player doesn't get too far off the path.\n\nSimple though it is the game is fun and I would gladly reccommend it to any fan of the series.","February 23","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's no moral dilemmas because there's no choices to be made in this game. It's not a branched narrative.\nThe graphics aren't 2016 worthy and it crashes a lot. BUT there's an amazing cinematic feel to every episode.\nIt's extremely difficult, even impossible to play without using the hints that are given to you. You will be stuck in a puzzle for a long time because most puzzles make no sense.\nThe most important aspect is obviously the story itself.

It has quite a few flaws that i will detail below, but the good triumphs over the bad if the game is on sale.\n\nGood aspects:\n\nDetailed and well thought out story that links all five episodes together - Each story has logical and believable writing and execution in relation to the movies. The motives of the characters is similar to that of what was in the movies and it is told well enough.\n\nGreat voice acting/dialogue/characters - the person portraying Marty sounds so similar to Mr. Fox in the movies that i kept on actually believing that it really was him doing his best vocal impression of himself at that young age. Christopher Lloyd was also a delight to listen to. As were the other lead characters for the most part.\n\nNostalgia - The game nails it when it comes to bringing memories back from the movies,  referencing certain aspects of the three movies and just celebrating the most memorable lines, moments and scenes in the movie trilogy without over doing it.\n\nBad aspects:\n\nPresentation/animation - The character renders and overall presentation is quite bad in comparison to other games that celebrate famous movies (such as Ghostbusters: The Video Game, which came out a year earlier and which looked well detailed and thorogh in its visual appearance snd actually lets you roam around freely with very few issues) Roaming around in the Hill Valley in this game can seem like somewhat of a chore at times with the limitations on where you can walk and the camera angles nearly impossoble to manouvere. That doesn't change whether you use the keyboard controls or your mouse. The design of Hill Valley looks decent enough, but the whole presentation and animations of the chatacters could have been way better if the right time and money was invested. Still, it was still ok and not game breaking for me. Graphically, the game doesn't look as if it reaches its potential.\n\nChoice-based gameplay being limited - The choices that they let your character make are very limiting and don't really add much to your path in the story because whichever options you pick, your character will ultimately go always go in the same path. That is because with the options they provide you during interaction with various characters, you almost always have to pick all of them to move forward in the story. For example, playing as Marty, as you're interacting with Doc Brown you need to find out a specific piece of information and are given four or more choices of questions or phrases you can ask/provide, but you have to ask pretty much all of them to get to where you need to so there isn't really a huge amount of choice involved in actuality.\n\nOverall, it is a very good game for what it is that would be most enjoyed if you're a fan of the movie series that could have been amazing if a little more time and money were invested into this. Probably not worth it for the full price, but is great value when on sale.\n\nHowever, if they released a sequel to this (whether in episodic format or otherwise), then i would definitely buy it especially if they fixed the flaws that were in this game.","November 2, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(You get all 5 episodes with one buy.)\nEvery episode will end with a twist and a short look to the next episode.\n\n\nThe graphics...\n...are nicely done.\nYou don't need a high end cpu to run this game.\nThe characters and environment have a comic book design which looks pretty sweet and you recognize all the characters from the movies.\n\n\nThe gameplay...\n...is really simple as you just do point and click und move with mouse or keyboard.\n\n\nThe soundtrack...\n...is awesome but hey, its just the same themes as in the movies!!!\nI'm glad they got the rights and didn't use new themes because otherwise it would be horrible.\n\n\nThe voice acting...\nThe voice actors are doing a good job.\nChristopher Lloyd as Doc Brown is the only actor from the movies who does the voice acting on this game.\nAll the other characters are beeing dubbed by different actors.\nAJ Locascio does a an amazing job portraiting Marty McFly.\nMichael J.

Sometimes simple things like a WALK CYCLE was not done correctly and Marty looked like he was walking with straight legs\n- Sometimes the animation stops or the dialogue stops while the animation catches up\n- The ending feels like an absolute cop out\n\nI know this is one of TellTales older games but I was expecting development from ep1 to ep5 (such as game mechanics getting better). But it feels unpolished. Simple things, such as making sure that a walking cycle looks believable shouldn't be neglected in any game, even if it's coming from an indie developer.\n\nI really love Back to the Future but this didn't feel like what the franchise deserved.

Some decent voice acting (always helps not to get distracted by poor dialogue) and an interesting time travel story. Fairly linear, particularly as the game is split into 5 chapters, although that's not necessarily a bad thing. Occasionally there are too many dialogue options to work through to move the story along but that's just a minor irritant.

When he gets released he will be killed and it is up to Marty to get him out and keep him alive.\n\nThe game is the typical point and click adventure with a Back to the Future theme. Events are overly predictable and over acted. It is an amusing story that can easily span all the chapters that they have released.\n\nThe down side is this game is very buggy. There are times when it will just kick you out of the program. Or when you do a completely obvious task before another task it prevents you from progressing.

If the answer is in any form "Yes", wether you were around when they were first released or it's something you have discovered at a later date then you owe it to yourself to play this brilliant gem of a point 'n click adventure.\n\nIt's the closest we're ever going to get to a 4th movie. With a plot taking place after the third movie (orginal writer Bob Gale consulting on the story)  and original cast members Christopher Lloyd (Doc), Claudia Wells (Jennifer) returning to voice their characters while a brilliant A.J. Locascio preforms a Marty that's virtualy indistinguishable from Michael. J. Fox (who does return to perform a small part in the final episode). Previously I stated that Thomas. F. Wilson returns as Biff Tannen, however this is only true for the 30th anniversary edition released for consoles.\n\n+ Epic continuation of a movie classic\n+ Great variation in puzzle difficulty\n+ Amazing voice cast\n+ That music!\n\n- A little unwieldy with 5 separate installs/playtimes for the 5 episodes. Thankfully Telltale abandonded this model in later products.\n\nVeridict: If point 'n click adventures are your thing treat yourself to this at the next suitable sale.

Marty controls with WASD and the emphasis is on puzzle solving rather than "choice & consequence". The lion's share of the game takes place in the Prohibition era with jaunts Back to the Future (generally to see what sorts of dystopia's you've created) and into the wild west ala the third movie.\n\nIt does a pretty decent job of capturing the feel of the movies and does a much better job of presenting the player with challenges than the current Telltale products do. The puzzles vary in difficulty from ones that you can breeze right through to some that will actually hold you up for quite a bit, but there's a hint system you can use if you get frustrated. There's also content you can miss, so be sure to search areas thoroughly.\n\nOverall I found it to be a pretty solid puzzle game and would recommend it to fans of the genre, the franchise, and/or the developer. It ends of somewhat interesting cliff-hanger too, so I hope it gets a sequel someday.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention, it takes up five seperate entries in your Steam library.

One way is if your a fan of Telltale games. The other is if you are a back to the future fan. In this case, I am the later half.\n\nTelltale perspective: I have played their more well know games such as TWD (both seasons) and The Wolf Among us. Both of which felt a little more creative. The Game also took me about 10 hours which seemed a little short for their games. The one thing that stuck out the most was that if you played their other games, get ready for a change, granted this is one of the first game like TWD or any such, so do cut it some slack.\n\nBack to the Future Perspective: Let me start off by saying I LOVE these movies (yes, even part 3). Had they decided to make a part 4, this would have worked in my opinion. They refrence the movies through out the episodes and try to stay true to everyones personalities in them. I was also surprised to see Christopher Lloyd play Doc Brown throught the whole game and see Micheal J. Fox play William Mcfly (Marty's Great grandpa). They even got Tom Wilson to voice Biff on home consoles.\n\nHow ever there were a fair share of things that couldve been fixed/ would be nice but not need to fix. (No spoilers) The end of episode 5 completly falls apart and then leaves it on a cliff hanger most notably.\n\nThere is rumor that the sequal is being made, but is bottem on the priority list, but hopefully Telltale will publish it soon.\n\nOverall, I would say definitly try it your a BttF fan, even if you dont like it, you'll probably like some of the refrences to the movies. It certainly beats BttF on NES. Its a maybe for you Telltale fans, like I said, this was the first of their style of games.

Fairly linear, particularly as the game is split into 5 chapters, although that's not necessarily a bad thing. Occasionally there are too many dialogue options to work through to move the story along but that's just a minor irritant. Well worth a look especially if at a sale price.","December 23, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Past that it is more of a puzzle game than anything.\n\nIf you like difficult challanges and a good storyline to go along with then, then I would suggest still picking it up. Just don't expect The Walking Dead out of it :) Very difficult at some points and pretty fun.\n\nEpisode one is a tad bit boring. Starts off rather slow, but it lets you get to know the characters and their stories.\nEpisode two however! That's where it picks up! Left on a cliffhanger, but I have to know what happens next! Don't get discuraged by episode one! Keep playing, it's worth it :3\nEpisode three bleeds into episode four. It gets sooooo much better at this point. I am now addicted and needs to know what happened. Especially with a cliffhanger ending?! So worth it!\nEpisode four is quite a lot longer and more story driven than anything, though it's harder to get through this one without getting caught up on a lot of things with items and the like. Not my favorite but not terrible either.\nEpisode five is the best by a long shot. Went by way to quick even though it took me 2 hours to get through everything. Awesome ending. Overall, best episode!","December 21, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can't blame the game for that, it's just unfortunate that the title that would've benefited most from the modern TellTale treatment just barely missed it.\n\nIt definitely has its moments, clever nods to BttF did not go unnoticed, and the voice acting is great. Marty's actor sounds a bit affected in Episode 1, but after that he really nails it. At one point, I was thinking, "Man, Doc's voice actor is spot on too," only to find out that, yeah, it's Christopher Lloyd. That works. I wasn't enraptured by the main direction of the story -- it worked as a "what-if," maybe not BttF IV caliber -- but I really liked a few places they took it.\n\nUltimately, while there is good, this game didn't add up for me. A lot of the gameplay is tedious and mundane, the mechanics can be wonky, and the narrative is hit-and-miss... and-miss. Hit-and-miss-and-miss is appropriate for much of the game, as it can feel like a dated, drab experience. In a lot of ways, it's a second-rate game.\n\nIt's BttF, so give it a spin. I wouldn't say it's worth the time, personally, but there are some good bits here and you'll probably surmise whether you like the game or not in the first two hours. If you don't, just change history and return it.","January 31","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact I was not sure what I was getting myself into when I bought the series.  It was one of those gotta have it, because it's Back to the Future.  I figured I'd play through it and it might be ok.  I will say that after looking into it a bit more I liked the idea that the Bobs atleast had somewhat of a hand in writing the story.  Overall, the series is a good one.  You'll get a good dose of characters you are familiar with, but they will also throw in some new ones.\n\nAs mentioned before Episode I relies heavily on the films, but for me that was a good thing.  I was very glad that Episode 1 eased me into the story.  I loved the films, and was hoping this game wasn't going to go and ruin them for me.  Thankfully it did not.  Episode 2-5 really distinguish themselves as breaking away from the film series, but do so in a way that carries on with story.\n\nOverall am I happy with how everything turned out?

Now a bit of personal info here, I am married (have been for a decade) and my wife, though not exactly crazy about video games, does enjoy a round or two of some games in my collection.  After she was finished with a round, and since there was nothing on TV, I decided to take over for a round.  Looking through a collection for something we both would enjoy, my choice was quickly overridden when my wife noticed that I had a Back to the Future adventure game.  So we took the time to fire up Telltale Game’s Back to the Future episode 1, a point and click adventure game with so many of the original cast and staff involved that it might as well be considered a sequel of sorts, though granted some thirty years afterwards.\n\nAnd sequel this very well could be; the writing is superb, the voices so on par, with many of the original characters playing themselves (sans the main character, though Michael J Fox does do some cameo appearances as the non-1985-prime McFly family) this is in many ways a continuation of the Back to the Future series that works well in-canon.  The graphics are pretty, and the animations are fantastic.  The controls are fantastic, and work surprisingly well with the Steam Gamepad.  The only part of the interface that I thought was a little odd was the inventory screen, but even with that, I found that the game parts of the game were so unobtrusive that I could often just ‘go through the motions’ of playing the game and feel like I was just watching a movie.  Indeed, if someone is looking for a more robust ‘adventure’ game, they may find this game somewhat lacking for that reason. Even with a  lot of interactable objects in each area, the game still feels like you only head in one direction, moving along a very specific course with interactable objects proving just a bit of flair.  In the end though, this game is a beautiful continuation of a fantastic movie series, and I fully intend to play this all the way through to it's conclusion. Anyone who loves the movies, or loves point and click adventure games, will eat this up.  Buy buy buy!\n\nGame’s Fate: Kept on the Steambox, will occasionally play it\nBuy/No Buy: If you like point and click adventure games, this one isn’t necessarily the most difficult or engaging, but it's enjoyable enough, and fans of the movies will love them.

Despite lacking some of the functionality Telltale's become known for in later games, especially regards to consequence, BttF is a solid adventure experience through and through with only a few bits I found frustrating.\n\nSet (initially) in Prohibition-era Hill Valley, the bulk of Back to the Future: The Game is an exploration of Doc Brown's past, and how he became the eccentric genius scientist we know him as in the movies. After tracking down Doc following a journey gone a bit awry, Marty McFly's stuck juggling multiple eras of Doc and eventually having to deal with a much different Doc than he's used to. The consequences of minor changes are even more evident this time around than they were in the films, though the quests to fix those changes show a wide variety of Hill Valleys that were and could have been.\n\nFirst things first, I need to commend all the performers they got to fill the various roles. Marty McFly's voice actor is a dead ringer for 80's-era Michael J. Fox, and the rest of the familiar cast is well-represented. New characters abound without overwhelming familiar faces, and are all established firmly enough that you care about them, be it out of love or of loathing. It's nice that the game manages to give Marty's history some time in the spotlight as well, despite all the focus on Doc.\n\nProgress in the game is based primarily on conversation, working your way through options to figure out what's going on, what to do next, and how to get people to do what you need. There are several points where this can get tedious and/or unclear as to how to proceed, but those bits are few and far between, especially as you get into the later episodes. There's a bit of item collection and use, but it takes a back seat to the dialogue trees, which makes for a great showcase of Telltale's writing skill. Action sequences pop up from time to time as well, which add to the cinematic feel of the game but are also the weakest, gameplay-wise. Several times, I found myself going in circles trying to figure out how to finish an action sequence, only to find I was missing a single, relatively tiny (visually and figuratively) piece of the puzzle. I guess my best advice for these bits is to look up. Always look up.\n\nOther than that, Back to the Future: The Game is absolutely worth your time. A fitting tribute to the films, these five episodes could easily be considered canon if they aren't already.","January 13","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's no story branching and while the game doesn't really have the same awe-factor as the movies, it still holds a charm of its own. The voice actor for Marty is pretty spot on for a Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd reprises his role as Doc Brown. The various versions of the characters you meet in the 1920s and the alternate realities of 1986 are interesting and unique.

It is a a bare bones point & click linear adventure game with many mildly infuriating components, but is a faithful 5 episode sequel to the BTTF movies.  You play as Marty McFly in 1985 which starts with an homage to the first movie, but takes place after the 3 movies.\n\nCons::\nOne track linear story: Your actions don't affect what happens in the story other than progressing it linearly and definitely do not carry over between episodes.  Choose Your Own Adventure books offer more choice.\n\nDialog selection not consistent with voice acting: On a regular basis I select a dialog choice, and Marty says something that differs in tone and/or content from what I selected, as if voice script was rewritten after the dialog UI was setup.\n\nMovement limited between areas: In 1st episode movement is limited from the front of the courthouse to either side of the courthouse.\n\nGraphics same as lowest common ported denominator: Aside from antialiasing, I may as well have run the game on a Nintendo Wii.  Low poly counts on characters is a bad choice for such a character & dialog driven game.\n\nEpisodes have separate settings and launchers: Ever change any of the game settings? Be prepared to change them for each new episode that you launch.  There is no central UI for accessing each of the episodes.\n\n\nPros::\nStory and atmosphere: This is a story that fits the franchise well and has a number of nuanced details that fans will appreciate.\n\nVoice acting: Telltale found an impressive Fox soundalike actor and Christopher Lloyd's return is great, along with decent supporting voice acting.\n\nHint system: Great for casual players.","January 18","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One way is if your a fan of Telltale games. The other is if you are a back to the future fan. In this case, I am the later half.\n\nTelltale perspective: I have played their more well know games such as TWD (both seasons) and The Wolf Among us. Both of which felt a little more creative. The Game also took me about 10 hours which seemed a little short for their games. The one thing that stuck out the most was that if you played their other games, get ready for a change, granted this is one of the first game like TWD or any such, so do cut it some slack.\n\nBack to the Future Perspective: Let me start off by saying I LOVE these movies (yes, even part 3). Had they decided to make a part 4, this would have worked in my opinion. They refrence the movies through out the episodes and try to stay true to everyones personalities in them. I was also surprised to see Christopher Lloyd play Doc Brown throught the whole game and see Micheal J. Fox play William Mcfly (Marty's Great grandpa). They even got Tom Wilson to voice Biff on home consoles.\n\nHow ever there were a fair share of things that couldve been fixed/ would be nice but not need to fix. (No spoilers) The end of episode 5 completly falls apart and then leaves it on a cliff hanger most notably.\n\nThere is rumor that the sequal is being made, but is bottem on the priority list, but hopefully Telltale will publish it soon.\n\nOverall, I would say definitly try it your a BttF fan, even if you dont like it, you'll probably like some of the refrences to the movies. It certainly beats BttF on NES. Its a maybe for you Telltale fans, like I said, this was the first of their style of games.

The only part of the interface that I thought was a little odd was the inventory screen, but even with that, I found that the game parts of the game were so unobtrusive that I could often just ‘go through the motions’ of playing the game and feel like I was just watching a movie.  Indeed, if someone is looking for a more robust ‘adventure’ game, they may find this game somewhat lacking for that reason. Even with a  lot of interactable objects in each area, the game still feels like you only head in one direction, moving along a very specific course with interactable objects proving just a bit of flair.  In the end though, this game is a beautiful continuation of a fantastic movie series, and I fully intend to play this all the way through to it's conclusion. Anyone who loves the movies, or loves point and click adventure games, will eat this up.  Buy buy buy!\n\nGame’s Fate: Kept on the Steambox, will occasionally play it\nBuy/No Buy: If you like point and click adventure games, this one isn’t necessarily the most difficult or engaging, but it's enjoyable enough, and fans of the movies will love them.  Buy.\n","February 14","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If the answer is in any form "Yes", wether you were around when they were first released or it's something you have discovered at a later date then you owe it to yourself to play this brilliant gem of a point 'n click adventure.\n\nIt's the closest we're ever going to get to a 4th movie. With a plot taking place after the third movie (orginal writer Bob Gale consulting on the story)  and original cast members Christopher Lloyd (Doc), Claudia Wells (Jennifer) returning to voice their characters while a brilliant A.J. Locascio preforms a Marty that's virtualy indistinguishable from Michael. J. Fox (who does return to perform a small part in the final episode). Previously I stated that Thomas. F. Wilson returns as Biff Tannen, however this is only true for the 30th anniversary edition released for consoles.\n\n+ Epic continuation of a movie classic\n+ Great variation in puzzle difficulty\n+ Amazing voice cast\n+ That music!\n\n- A little unwieldy with 5 separate installs/playtimes for the 5 episodes. Thankfully Telltale abandonded this model in later products.\n\nVeridict: If point 'n click adventures are your thing treat yourself to this at the next suitable sale.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix_advance/recommended/31290/","phoenix_advance","phoenix_advance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix_advance/","515 products in account","This game came out in 2011. Can't believe it's been that long already! It would be silly of me to make assumptions, but what the hey ... it's fun :) I'm willing to bet that Back to the Future: The Game is what set the precedence for the success of The Walking Dead and then later The Wolf Among Us. It's as clear as seeing the connection between Call of Juarez: The Cartel being a precedence for Dead Island.\n\nI haven't played the CSI series from TellTale Games, but I remember a friend speaking highly of it to me one day whilst we were travelling to Uni. My gut feeling tells me that would have contained the ground work of the TellTale Tool (game engine), enhanced over the years.\n\nBack to the Future: The Game is more akin to a true point and click adventure. There are triggers embedded within dialogue that progress the story as opposed to The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, in which selecting dialogue has no effect other than customising the story to the player's liking. I mean, there were some portions like that, but it was quite impassive. And your choices in one episode will not be carried to any other episodes.\n\nThe gameplay is quite challenging in figuring out what to do next. Sometimes there are tiny interactive hotspots on the screen that you never think about clicking on (like a small switch), other times you have to figure out which item in your inventory that you must use on an interactive hotspot.\n\nLuckily there is a pretty cool system that gives you hints bit by bit and only when you want them. I found myself using an average of 3 hints for each episode (mainly out of impatience). If this were the early 90's, this would be the type of game that you'd get stuck on for a day and try to figure it out by asking friends at school, lol.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glUXst_yYKw\nThe story in Back to the Future: The Game was actually kind of painful. Each episode was about fixing Marty's broken 1986 reality after accidently altering an event amongst characters back in 1931. The annoying feeling is the same thing you feel when watching Back to the Future 2 and Biff Tannen owns everything. But there are also hilarious moments in the game. It's very up and down. Some parts in some episodes you'd rate 90/100 and other parts you'd give as low as 40/100. If I had to give an aggregate score, I'd probably rate the entire game 68/100.\n\nFor the die hard fans, there are lots of cameos and parodies made via dialogue and recognisable 3d model objects. This may sound lame ... but this game is very Back to the Futureish and wouldn't be so if there wern't all these cameo's like a guy yelling, "Hey! He just took that guy's wallet! I think he took his wallet."\n\nIn conclusion (and please don't hate me peeps), but this game really ain't worth $5USD on special. I remember around the same year this game called L.A Noir was released. In my opinion that game whilst being open-world ... was very much an advance point and click adventure as well. Shortly after, L.A Noir hit about $3.75USD. But the point is, it was pretty damn advance compared to Back to the Future: The Game, engine-wise ... which did seem unfinished somewhat ... I mean invisible walls ... really? Even each episode (1-5) was released as a separate game download causing you each time to configure things like screen resolution.","April 2","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You click on various items to interact with them or investigate them, and use the items and your surroundings to solve puzzles that advance the story. Does it work? Well, yes and no. When it comes to video games, there’s an age-old question: Gameplay or Story: which is more important? Well, if you’ve ever been on the fence about this question, then Back to the Future: The Game will solve it for you in the first half an hour.\n\nFirst, the story is astounding. It manages to fully capture all the magic and feel of the original movies while still being its own thing. After playing through the whole game, I, and I’d say most other people who played it, felt the story alone made it worthy to bear the title of Back to the Future Part IV. Considering that it was a collaboration from the people at Telltale Games, the people behind Tales from the Borderlands, and the guys who made the original three movies, and the story writer for this game happens to be the very same person who wrote the original three movies, I’m not all that surprised, though I am impressed that they managed to capture the same magic of the original movies more than twenty-five years after they released. The voice work is fantastic all-around, unsurprising since they got some of the original actors to play their parts, and every new character feels like they always belonged in the Back to the Future universe. For the most part, the dialog is well-written, the graphics are surprisingly fitting and work well, and the music is…directly stolen from the movies. Of course, the soundtrack of the movies is fantastic, so that’s not necessarily a bad thing. In addition, the puzzles are clever without being completely unfair. My favorite part of the game was during the last episode, where you have to jog somebody’s memory through giving their brain certain stimulations to represent what happened in the past. A mop head on a cactus makes a grandpa, a sign on an outhouse makes a saloon, and so on. I only ever had to look up the solution to one puzzle in the very first episode, and that ended up only being because my controller didn’t recognize a required object as an item.\n\nAnd that’s where we get into what’s wrong with the game. After all, when you get a bunch of movie producers to make a video game, you can expect the story and dialog to be good, but the game itself? Not so much. Where should I start? Well, the camera is among the worst I‘ve ever seen, being annoyingly hard to control, and since most of the time you never need to manipulate it, you end up forgetting you can entirely, which makes parts of the game later on when you do need to manipulate it very confusing. It also picks these strange moments to suddenly switch perspectives, which throw you off whenever you’re trying to go somewhere across town. There are invisible walls everywhere, giving you a sort of fake-3D experience, but then often you can move around freely, and you just can’t tell the difference. Despite Hill Valley feeling so big, I feel just so constricted because of this. Plus, Marty is so slow! Even when he’s running, which, if you’re smart, he’ll always be, it still feels like it takes forever to get anywhere. All three of these aspects combined makes traversing the world around you a chore. That’s not mention the terrible controls. Here’s the thing: you’ll spend half of your time clicking, and the other half walking. Initially, it seems that a controller is the best option for both of these, as one of the control sticks can be used to skip from one clickable item onscreen to another with ease, and the other can be used to walk freely, whereas you have to drag the mouse a couple of inches away from Marty in whatever direction you want to go if you want to use the mouse. However, as I mentioned earlier, sometimes your controller will skip right over items, because it doesn’t recognize them, and very often, those items are required to solve a puzzle in the game. So you end up constantly switching between two means of controlling, using the controller to move and the mouse to click, and, trust me, it gets REALLY annoying. Also, if you hold down either the mouse or the button for more than a half a second during dialog, it sometimes acts like you clicked twice, and skips important pieces of dialog. Also, just a tip: in the first episode, a reporter will ask Marty for his name. Just tell her it’s Harry Callahan, because no matter what, everyone is going to refer to him as that.\n\nIs playing the game a chore? Not necessarily. The music and characters keep the atmosphere up, the puzzles are fairly good, and the story makes you want to keep going. It’s more of a whether or not the story is worth drudging through the terrible camera and controls. I’ll tell you this; if Chuggaconroy ever made a let’s play of this game, I’d recommend watching it well over playing the game yourself. However, when you look at the other Steam reviews for the game, you’ll see that the vast majority are positive, and most of the negative ones simply say that the game is “meh,” and the story and gameplay cancel each other out. Many of the positive reviews say that the story is what makes the game worth playing. And here’s the thing: I think they’re right. The game is going to be really annoying to play through due to the controls, but the feeling you’ll get when you solve a puzzle is never to be underestimated, and every resulting cutscene is a reward in and of itself. I certainly wouldn’t recommend watching a walkthrough over playing it, but if you have a character of interesting personality doing a let’s play, you might want to stick to that. Still, the story, music, dialog, characters, and perfect capturing of the feel of the movies makes this game more than worth the while. On the gameinformer scale of 1-10, with 7 being average, 10 being perfection, and 1 being the Ouya controller, I’d give this game a 4 for gameplay and 9 for story, which rounds off to 6.5, and I‘ll bring it up to a 7 just so I can recommend it officially.\n\nBack to the Future: The Game, gets a 7 out of 10.","April 18","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The voicing is vey well done and the little nods and winks to the films make this a very immersive game into the whole BTTF universe.

Sure there are puzzles and common sense in certain situations seem to went home I do enoy the game.\n\nThere are some complaints, I have notice pencil icons in the game. I learned that events happen in that area and players not meant to see it but it does throw me off. The other is when two people are on the screen they both are talking. I checked other people and they too have this.\n\nOther than that, fun game.","June 2","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
