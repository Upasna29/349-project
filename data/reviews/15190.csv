Some of the character animations are a bit awkward, and one particular glitch sent a German rifleman across the map where he promptly caught himself on barbed wire and ruined the mood. The textures could be worse, but that's like saying that Duke Nukem Flopped could've been more hyped. For 2005, graphically speaking, it's mediocre. Not great, not terrible, not a benchmark for games and not something you'll want to recycle for toilet paper. While being failry realistic, it suffers from having people die very quickly, which can be frustrating when you need that person for a particular job, as shown perfectly by Objective XYZ. The multiplayer has two players who each command two teams to try and eliminate the other team. While not a straight up shooter, it would be nice to see some other objectives rather than just kill everyone else. This is BiA, not Quake.\n\nTHE GREAT\nThe story is fantastic. Not Half Life fantastic mind you, you do not have a wide range of ways to be attached to the game. Be that as it is, BiA is still worth playing just for it's story. Gritty, depressing and a bit too real at times, BiA is not for children, those with a weak stomach or those who get attached to characters quickly. The gameplay is solid and fair, giving you advantages when you constantly fail, but also giving you the choice wheather or not you take that extra. You will get attached to characters, some quicker than others, and if they die in combat, or via scripted event, it can be a real pain, due to the fact that you cannot save whenever you want. This can be good though, it pushes the story along and makes character deaths even more shocking than in games such as Halo: Combat Evolved.\n\nTHE UGLY\nMost players will die a few times during this game, myself included. The introduction of a few characters can feel a bit strange when they either die or are never mentioned again during later missions. One death in particular was shocking, although it did seem a bit pointless, as I had been involved in the game quite a bit and hadn't gotten a grasp on who he was or why he was there. The following mission had you sniping from a tower while you sent your soldiers to work down below, but this personally felt like it wanted to be an RTS for a mission. For half the mission, either the enemy soldiers are too far away or the bloody tanks get in the way which make it feel less team oriented, and more like a straight up FPS while still keeping the same mechanics, which means that getting killed instantly by a tank shell is not impossible. Thankfully it only lasted one mission and was not seen again.\n\nTHE VERDICT\nThis is the best game in the series so far. Earned in Blood shows a different perspective, which is fine, but storywise the third game Hell's Highway has an intro cutscene which basically sums up Road to Hill 30 and Earned in Blood, which may make you wonder why you bought RtH30 and EiB, but you bought them because you are a good boy and played the first ones because they were better games.\n\nSIMILAR GAMES\n-Earned in Blood, Hell's Highway to a lesser extent\n-Star Wars Republic Commando\n\nFor more reviews check out http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereview","November 26, 2013","true","13.5"," 67 of 74 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","67","74","3","1"

If you have ever wanted a serious WWII game that tells a touching and thought-provoking story, this is it. Don't be fooled by the game's age, it's gameplay is engaging and challenging, and the story is, in my opinion, the best story ever told through the medium of video games - REALLY. If you have never played it, or the other titles, you won't understand the perfection of the story-telling that goes on in this series. To top it all off, the game is based upon real events, people, and actions, and so feels very realistic. Overall, this and the others in the series, are incredibly immersive video games, with an important, exciting, touching, gritty, at times humerous, and bleak story around the horrors experienced by the 101st Airborne 502PIR during WWII. 10/10 would rank 10/10.","June 22, 2014","true","27.1"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/portanor/recommended/15190/","portanor","Porta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/portanor/","128 products in account","Here's my review on "Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30".\n\nAs far as I know this is the first game of the series. You play as Sgt. Matt Baker, a troubled soldier that was never ready to lead men in combat. But as this was forced upon him on the night of 6th of June 1944 on D-Day. Throughout the game, you'll lead your men (everywhere from one man up to 3 men and a tank or 6-7 men) and defeat the German Warmachine in Normandy before you'll face the ultimate test of Hill 30.\n\nI first played this game way back when it was on PS2 and one of the best shooters I had ever played. Now you kinda ought to have prior experience with this game in order to really enjoy it. Because, face it, the graphics are somewhat hard to look at with modern technology available.\nThe idea behind the game is rather simple: you're usually given 1 or 2 teams. You use them to overcome what the german forces might throw at you, that being normal infantry, AT-guns and MG's, mortars or tanks. It's all first person, except a tactical map you can check every now and then.\nYou use f.ex the fireteam to pin the enemy down and then flank with your assault team. (and yes, this game has a rather well done "suppressive fire"-system, which has come to be something BiA is known for.) It sounds very simple, but sometimes it can be a little tricky.\nIt has very outdated graphics, decent voiceacting (a little better in later games), very good soundeffects, excellent story/plot, but a little repetetive gameplay. Controlls are good.\n\nSo:\nGraphics: 6/10 It's old, so give it some slack\nSounds: 8/10 Sometimes the voiceacting and dialogue are a little awkward\nGameplay: 7/10 A little repetetive, but challenging and brings a new factor to FPS' that's very rare. Try to suppress the NPC's in the campain on BF4 f.ex...\nControlls: 8/10 They're good enough. Twerk it to make it 100% the way you want it.\n\nAll in all: 7/10\n\nThis game feels very good to me, but I can not be objective about it. Might be a challenge to stick to it if you haven't played it before.\n\nSincerely yours\nPorta","August 24, 2014","true","5.1"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","25","29","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SeesqueeTalks/recommended/15190/","SeesqueeTalks","Seesquee Talks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SeesqueeTalks/","81 products in account","I am a full time soldier in the Canadian Army. I love my job, I work with some terrific people, get to do some really cool things and there really is no life like it. The military is also what helped bring me out of side scrollers and into the world of 3D gaming that we play in today, As a teenager I was raised by military parents, and retired military Grandparents. I watched movies about The Great War, World War II, Vietnam, went to the War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario and listened to my Dad as he told me about my Great Grandfather and his role in Vimy Ridge.\n\nIt only made sense that, eventually I’d find myself purchasing a copy of Gearbox’s Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30, when I bought my first Xbox. I’d played other World War shooters on the Playstation and PC prior to this, but it never really stuck. While it was cool to play as an Allied soldier working undercover for the OSS, I was never convinced it was a very good representation of the life of a soldier.\n\nBrothers in Arms had me from the start. When I first popped in the disk and heard the Brothers in Arms theme, the music just hit me right to my core. The beautiful, sad but powerful marching music in the menus made me pause and sit for a few minutes to just soak it in, and I realized right then that I was going to be in for a journey that I’d never been in before.\n\nHowever, I’m going to skip forward a few years. See after being in the military for a few years, I found myself coming back to Brothers in Arms. This time when I started the game, the haunting words of Sergeant Matt Baker struck me and really made me feel and understand why this game had me from the start. I find that most military shooters are just “bang bang explosion, pow pow Nazi!” Brothers in Arms makes you feel the soldiers pain, joy and regrets as they evolve from gung-ho soldiers at the start of D-Day to their final showdown at Hill 30.\n\nAs Soldiers in the field, every decision made can have horrible consequences. Many of us have lost friends, have our loved ones leave us to come home to empty houses and many of us have even lost limbs or the ability to have a good nights sleep, all in the name of our flag and freedom. Most of us do not regret these decisions as we recognize that they must be done in order for others to enjoy the freedoms and rights that we have. The life of the soldier is almost never glamorous. It’s a job and we do the very best we can with whatever scenario that is given to us. This is shown in Brothers in Arms several times over the course of the series. One character at one point in the game loses his mind over the grief of losing two squadmates under his command. Another character finds himself running into a burning building to rescue a soldier who himself was trying to rescue an innocent. Characters are killed, others hurt to the point of having to be sent home, and yet the rest soldier on. They do what needs to be done and that makes this game very special.\n\nThe words that open the first game in the Brothers in Arms series still give me pause whenever I hear them. They are the words of a man who has lost his friends and lost his sense of youth and vigor to get the job done. Matthew Baker is tired of this damn war and everything that led to where he is and just wants it to be over. Read these words and imagine you’d been in hell for over a week, each day feeling longer than the last.\n\n“My dad said something to me after the divorce. He said that every soldier has two families, those you raise and those you raise Hell with. I’ve spent eight days here, eight days commanding a squad I wasn’t ready to lead, eight days watching my men – my family – kill and be killed. Eight days wishing it would stop.”\n\nFrom there you open up to a Brutal shootout with Matt’s squad pinned down by enemy fire and tanks. The screams of squad mates calling for support on the radio with no reply. The shouts of the company First Sergeant barely keeping the fear out of his voice as he tried to keep his men calm and focused. The disbelief of a soldier as he tries to rouse his fire team partner who has suddenly dropped dead. Finally, mercifully a tank shell explodes near you and everything gets hazy. The last thing you see before everything goes black is a soldier – having finally snapped from the pressure – expose himself to enemy fire, calling for death, and taking a blast from a tank as a result. It’s a very shocking and sudden introduction to a game that introduces you to amazing characters. Then one by one they are taken away from you as you begin to feel like they are holding your sanity together while you fight your way through hell.\n\nCamaraderie is a big thing in military life. The constant razzing of your buddies, supporting them when they are down and picking on them when they goof up. There are several moments like this in the Brothers in Arms series that really cement that feeling of camaraderie for the player. In the first game, two of the most memorable characters are some guys named Allan and Garnet, who met up in boot camp and became inseparable. The chatter that they have between (and sometimes during) missions is some of the best dialogue I’ve heard in a military shooter, and it would be a great loss to lose these guys in a firefight. In particular there’s an awesome argument between them and another soldier about Batman VS Superman that cemented their awesomeness in my mind forever.\n\nOf course I’m getting away from myself with comparing my life to that of characters in what is still in the end just a videogame. In my opinion it’s a damn good one too. One which spawned two other games that were great as well. Aside from authenticity, one of the big things that I really enjoyed about these games was the challenge and the tactical gameplay. Your squadmates were very smart and did their best to keep you alive, they followed direction but also knew better than to let you get them killed by ordering them to do something silly like attack a tank head on. The enemy functioned the same way making strategy key to victory. You had to be very careful with this as well because your men and you were very vulnerable. In Brothers in Arms, one very well placed shot could kill you in an instant, there are no magic health packs or regenerating health and running out in the open was suicidal. This made it the first shooter I ever played where making use of cover not only made sense, but was essential to survival.\n\nBrothers in Arms has been without a new entry for some time now, with Brothers in Arms: Hell’s Highway hitting stores in 2008 and ending in a bit of a cliffhanger. Gearbox Software announced a spinoff called Furious Four a while ago which was supposed to make the series similar to Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds. This enraged a rather large number of BIA fans though and Gearbox ended up removing it from the Brothers in Arms name. A couple years ago Gearbox’s Randy Pitchford told IGN that another authentic Brothers in Arms game was on it’s way but that the wait could be up to five years. However, my hopes are high that we will see something in the near future , as I personally think that Brothers in Arms is the best shooter series I’ve ever played and I am looking forward to seeing what’s next for these characters.","March 27","true","1.0"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

I bought this on disk originally and played it into the dirt.  I saw it on a steam sale and thought I might give it another go.  I literally ran though this one since I remembered the fights and it still took me 9 hours to complete it.  If you have a WWII D-Day fantasy this is definitely a game you will  enjoy.  You get to lead a squad of men through the first 9 days or so of the D-Day invasion.  If you like paint ball or doing headshots while upside down this isn't a game you will enjoy.  If you like dramatic "roleplay" type warrior stuff then do yourself a favor and pick up this title.  This game is enjoyable as a SINGLE PLAYER GAME only.\n\nI ran it on Windows 7 64 bit maxed out just fine on a 4 year old PC.  The story, the gameplay and the characters are all top notch.

It was unlike any WW2 shooter at the time and even now it's something of a special snowflake amongst a horde of FPS's on steam. Seeing it on sale I decided to pick it up again, this being the THIRD time I have purchased Brothers In Arms in some manner (got a beat-up CD-box set from amazon. I think the guy who sold it to me sat on it).\n\nSo how does Brothers in Arms stand out from the crowd, especially from a time when we were once tired of WW2 shooters?\n\nDeploying tactical charges and employing cunning tactics are your only surefire way to make it to the end of the level with yourself and your men intact. Everything from rifle sway, debris and the unforgiving difficulty keep you from reliving memories from Wolfenstein or Medal of Honor and force you to focus and pin enemies down with relentless fire.\n\nThis method of gameplay has been a turnoff for some, as it is very hard to actually get through some skirmishes, but I find it fascinating. I can't recall many games utilizing supression fire to achieve victory over an enemy, who come at you in increasingly large numbers. Through this method of gameplay I've found it to be oddly satisfying to land a kill-shot on a Jerry and send his body ragdolling across the pavement. Landing that final blow is far more rewarding then in most games, where the enemy stands out in the open doing little in terms of self preservation.\n\nOf course, another major selling-point for BIA is the story. Unlike MoH or CoD, the fighting is a lot more personal and evocative. the main character, Sgt Matt Baker, is fleshed out, poetic, caring and loyal. Not to mention the characters of your friends and squad-mates are equally endering. Going back, I was astonished by how much character was present in this game compared to games at the time and even today. None of these soldiers are cigar-chomping, hardened veterans. They are optimistic young men, brash yet friendly, stressed yet humorous. They feel like genuine human beings, a refreshing take on Soldiers compared to the nihilistic shouting and brooding from many Modern-Military shooters of today. Sgt Matt Baker and friends see through the patriotism and have first-hand experiences of the horrors of war, yet they strive forward with wit, humor and optimism to reach the end of the day.\n\nHowever, even at the time, BIA falters on the graphical front. Many textures are muddy and blurry, especially up-close. The levels are rather drab as well. Even at the time they weren't exactly eye-candy. However, they serve the gameplay well, and some special effects such as dirt clogging your vision and muzzle-flashes help reel you into the atmosphere.\n\nSpeaking of which, much of the game is played against a silent soundtrack with nothing but machine-gun beats, wind and bullet-impacts riddling your ears. The sound design is top-notch for a game like BIA and creates a fantastic atmosphere against the set-pieces of D-Day and skirmishes that followed.\n\nWith all that being said, I can't exactly say I can recommend BIA to everyone. Those looking for a challenge might be pleased but a few may be turned off by the cumbersome controls and lack of modern FPS features like sprinting, prone positions or cover-vaulting. For someone like me, who is a bit of a history nut, I was ecstatic to play this once more on steam and experience the story again.\n\nIf this game is right up your alley and are itching to get your ♥♥♥ kicked by rifle-totting krauts, then look no further then Brothers in Arms and it's fantastic sequel!\n\n","January 2","true","9.4"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","16","17","2","0"

I then played Earned in Blood on PS2, and Hell Highway on PS3. And I was blown away every time and still am.\nThese games are what military shooters should be. It basically Band Of Brothers, the video game. Brothers in arms is one of the only games to actually get me to shed a tear. The story is great and very historically accurate and realistic, as with the gameplay. The music is amazing, the voice acting is fantastic, the graphics are great. But the main focus here is the experience and the story. The story of these games in my opinion is bar-none. No other military shooter has had a story like these games. And its the only non-horror military shooter that can be scary at times.\n\n10/10 Extremely Recommended","May 20","true","11.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

This game stands out from other tactical games , most of them you are given a straticic veiw of the map and you command various different units to take out enemy units. But in this game you jump into the role of squad leader of a paratrooper regiment taking part in the 1944 DDay operation , and the aftermath to take Normandy. Instead of the stratigic overveiw , your in First person , commanding your men realisticly throughout the battlefeild , trying to keep your units alive and yourself. Not only is the there out of this world gameplay style different from normal tactical games , There is an actul story line , where each unit has a name , a backstory and a personality and when certain characters die in the story , you might atuly feel upset over what just happend. Also the story line is presented in a unique way which was pulled off with pure class , The protagonist of the story (Sgt.MattBaker) narates and tells backtories and stories of characters inbetween missions , and how he feels about them , and this can change throughout the story. Overall i think this game has a Brillaint and unique gameplay style , using to concept of miilitristic , tactical shooter , with a story plot we actuly care about , unlike most shooters we shove the storyline in the corner and rush through the game then complain the game was too short. This game changes that. Also i think this game is the thinking man's shooter , where he must plan his aproach through the harsh battefeilds then watch as his plan is executed and see if it works or doesn't. Only one complaint can be made about this game , that is the artificial Intelligance can somtimes (not always) be worse that a goldfish.

Matt Baker as he fights his way across Normandy, from the near the beaches to right into Carentan.\n\nStory\nRoad to Hill 30 follows Sgt. Matthew Baker, the "shy and poetic young man" who doesn't want to lead his 'Baker's Dozen' across the French countryside. The story is told from Baker's perspective as he progresses through living hell in France, watching his friends die all around him with nothing he can do about it. Unlike most games, it really focuses on how much hell war is and how much it effected those who were/are encapsulated by it's claws. It is told in a believable manor and is quite powerful and emotional at times. The story follows the real campaign during the second world war very closely and a lot if not all of the major battles fought, acutally did happen. There are also some realistic minor details such as SPOILER:(George Risner's tank when he dies. It has the same number on it and it was left in an area exactly the same as a photo taken of a broken down tank during the fight in Normandy) It's stuff like that I love in games.\n\nGameplay\nThe main tactics of this game are the Four F's (Find, Fix, Flank and Finish.) You can order your men to move with you, move to a certain location, suppress the enemy or charge the enemy. The enemies have suppression indicators on top of their heads, red meaning unsuppressed and grey meaning suppressed and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ themselves. This simple idea works fluidly and 99% of the time is not a nuisance to deal with during tense firefights. These orders are carried out by the two squads you have under your command, (not all the time, especially towards the beginning, you only have a few men) the Fire team, and the Assualt team. The 'ideal' way the game encourages you to defeat enemies is with the Four F's and the 2 squads:\n\n1. Put your Fire team in sensible cover and have them suppress the enemy.\n2. Take you Assault team and flank the enemies.\n3. When you are at the enemies' exposed flank, kill them then regroup and move on to the next group of enemies.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of the time it isn't that simple. Your weapon sway is crazy so you won't be able to go rambo all the time, thus encouraging the utilization of your squad/s. Although the core gameplay is very good, the AI occassionally lets itself down with decisions such as choosing air particles rather than a barricade for cover against an MG42, or some squad members become rebellious and no longer respond to orders for a period of time. Other than that, the gameplay is engaging, fun and challenging at times.\n\nGraphics, Animations and Sound\nAlthough the graphics and animations are not fantastic in this game, the sound is very good and has the right balance between chaotic war and bursted eardrums. The soundtrack in all of the Brothers in Arms games including this one are fantastic and add fuel to the burning pyre of emotion in the credits and cutscenes. It's so well done that I feel like crying even as I adjust the resolutions and anti-aliasing settings. Graphics and animations are not this game's strong point but that should not be a problem as long as you're not one of those people who only plays games for the realistic visuals and not the great gameplay and story.\n\nMap Design\nRoad to Hill 30 does a good job in general when it comes to map design although it is quite linear (hard not to be in this type of game) and the areas become quite repetative after long play sessions (the game is so good that I usually play most of the game in one sitting) Nearly all of the game is in similar looking French countryside. It's not that big of a deal really and is fixed decently in the next title in the series. (Earned in Blood).\n\nExtras\nThe game has various unlockables that you get for completing missions on certain difficulty levels. (The higher the difficulty, the more extras you get). Some of the extras available are pictures, documents (some de-classified), more detail/story to characters and even cheats such as infinite ammo etc. The extra difficulty is well worth the reward in my opinion.\n\nVerdict\nBrothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 is a fantastic game with solid functions and precise gameplay that puts you on the edge of your seat for hours. Although it may not be the best game in terms of graphics, animations and silly AI, it more than makes up for itself with it's gritty story that had me riveted throughout the whole playthrough. If you want a realistic WW2 shooter that shows the real gore and terror of war, this game is for you!","January 27","true","5.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

When Gearbox advertized it as being the most authentic and realistic WWII game to date, they meant it. With the help of retired Army Col. John Antal, Randy Pitchford and the creative team at Gearbox researched hundreds, if not, thousands of files and photos from WWII at the National Archive and Records Administration in DC, in order to accurately recreate the towns of Normandy, Carentan, and the surrounding farming areas using recon photos from 60 year old, now 70 year old aerial photos. The files don't go just from that, they photocopied written reports from Col. Cole and other military leaders on the tactical actions that are accurately recreated in the game. And how are the tactical movements accurately recreated in the game in an environment context? Amazingly, as Gearbox artists traveled and photographed much of the area shown in the game. The houses you will see, the buidlings, industrial areas, fences, hills, even the friggin hedges, they all exist in real life and were placed accordingly from research photos and recon maps. It's amazing and profound.\n\nThe game is remarkable not just for the authenticity, but the true to life story of the soldiers. While the likeness and names aren't what they were in real life, the actions of Matt Baker and his squad are based on the actions of the 502nd Parachute Regiment of the 101st Airborne during Mission Albany. I shouldn't have to explain the story, as it's based on real events, but Matt Baker leads his squad from Normandy after the events of D-Day to secure nearby land and the town of Normandy. The in-between narrative is what really makes Baker's character profound though, because it's evident that the war is effecting him emotionally as some of his men die.\n\nThe tactical movements from the files mentioned above are use as accurate movements of the linearity of the levels. Because these movements actually happened, that means the game isn't very open, but that doesn't detract from the quality of using your squad to suppress fire and flanking the enemy with your assault team. The gameplay is a hybrid of being an FPS and a strategy game. You command your squads, fire and assault teams. You can place your team into cover and then order them to suppress fire. Rather simple, but intuitive and fun. There's also the strategy view, which is supposed to simulate recon maps a Sgt. would have studied and memorized beforehand, but being a videogame, Gearbox doesn't strain this on you and allows you to view the area in a semi bird view, getting a strategic idea of how to move on.\n\nI'd like to say that the graphics are decent enough. I just can't believe this game came out nearly a decade ago, 2005, and how they compare now. The levels are designed perfectly, just play the sniper level, you get to see all of Carentan. But only two years later, the first Crysis would come out. I just think Gearbox could have spent a little more time in the textures. Otherwise, the animation was made using motion capture as a basis, and it does look good. The sound design is insanely well done. This game puts you in the battlefield without some soundtrack playing Hans Zimmer for no particular reason. As for the music that is in the game, the pause menu music or the music played over some of the cutscenes are remarkable and true to WWII films. The Prague Philharmonic did a fantastic job in the orchestration.\n\nI think I covered everything. Absolutely my favorite WWII shooter, next to Brothers in Arms: Hells Highway.\n\n9.3/10","July 3, 2014","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jakiebob/recommended/15190/","Jakiebob","Cybercacoarchubus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jakiebob/","233 products in account","Now, in order for a tactical, squad-based shooter like Brothers in Arms to succeed, three key elements need to work: level design for allowing tactical choices, the squad commands for being able to efficiently tell your squads what to do, and the AI for being able to actually do to what you tell them to do.\n\nThe level design is open enough to allow for flanking and other such tactical strategies. You'll get a spot for one squad to lay down supressing fire while your other squad or yourself gets a path to flank them. It also doesn't get too repetitive in repeating that formula through every level though, so it keeps things fresh. In some levels, for example, you get to command a tank and you and your squad have to use the tank as cover while moving down empty streets towards the enemy. The level design also provides a decent challenge for players who enjoy that, like myself, though two or three of the levels do ramp up the difficulty quite unexpectedly. The level design isn't as open as I hoped, as you usually get only one or two ways to flank an enemy. I would have preferred lots of ways to get around the enemy so there are more options available to the player. However, the level design is good enough that it emphasises the main mechanic of the game, that is supressing and flanking, and keeps it fresh throughout.\n\nControlling squads is very easy and very quick, both of which are very important if you're in a firefight. Telling one squad to suppress an enemy then switching to your other squad and telling them to move to a certain postition is very simple and straightforward. No complaints here.\n\nThe AI is probably the most important aspect that needs to be good in a game like this, and for the most part, the AI was good. Your squads will follow your commands quite well, be it suppressing an enemy or charging they're position. They listen well and react quickly to whatever you tell them. Occasionally though, the AI had it's hiccups. A couple times one of my squadmates would be killed because they took cover on the wrong side of a wall and twice I had to continue the rest of a level without a squadmate because they got stuck in a bush and couldn't move. The enemy AI could have been better, as they usually stick only to their cover and never try to flank you or try any other aggressive tactics that could have added a little more to the gameplay. For the most part though, the AI is good and does its job very well.\n\nAs for the rest of the game, the voice acting and writing aren't awful, but they're not that good. Not like that should really affect the game as a whole, that main draw for this game is the tactical gamplay and that is very good with good level design, easily controllable squads, and sufficient AI.","December 28, 2013","true","9.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It combines the first person shooting of the time with basic tactical combat of cover and flanking. The gameplay is more realistic, you're not going to be sniping people from across a map with the basic guns. Rather you flank and manuever your team to take out the unfortunate enemy.\n\nIf you want to play an engaging, somewhat realistic WWII shooter which allows you to really control the action, give it a shot.

This is definitely not meant to be fast-paced run and gun type shooter. Gameplay is much slower and more methodical than games such as Call of Duty, commanding and leading a couple teams of soldiers. The characters have great dynamics, interacting and bantering with hilarious dialogue. People die in war, and after a while of playing with these characters and watching them die I genuinely felt like crap. It's a pretty immersive game for the most part, except for some rough spots where the game just decides to crap on you. If you want, after a few deaths in the same spot the game offers to heal up your squad so you can get through the mission, but it's entirely optional. All in all a pretty good game.\n\n5/5 would experience again","February 4, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The AI is smart enough but there are times they get stuck etc. Other than that the game is great both on visual and gameplay and the sound is also very good in this game. There are parts in the game where you get stuck and makes you really frustrated but you just have to keep trying.

The concept, atmosphere, and gameplay fundamentals are great - certain levels make you feel like you're seconds from being overwhelmed by German soldiers, and good art design helps distract you from the game's age.\n\nThere are too many technical issues, though. It's not a difficult game in terms of the tactics you use. When you make mistakes in leading your squad, your losses are earned, but when questionable level design and bad botpathing mean your squad gets chewed up because they go somewhere you never intended, it's just frustrating. The difficulty spikes you come up against aren't because the game's too hard, they're because you must play through a map where your squad's A.I. is plagued with bad pathfinding. In fact, I find the broader, more complicated maps are done very well, while the simpler, tighter maps will find your squad regularly running to the wrong side of a wall and getting cut to pieces. I like difficulty when it's part of the design. I don't like having to fight a game to make it work properly.\n\nIt's a phenomenal game when it works, but you'll come up against a few levels that so badly implement the gameplay that playing through turns from a joy into a chore.","August 28, 2014","false","8.0"," 8 of 26 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","8","26","0","0"

So the idea is your aim is deliberately extremely poor and you have to give orders for your squad to create cover fire while you go around the buildings or whatever to shoot the enemy in the back.\n\nThe idea is boring and terribly repetitive and it's a very bad FPS, with all the mistakes a bad FPS could make: you can miss a shot even if the crosshair is on target, bad gameplay feel and viewport, clumsy controls, very bad map hit boxes, small obvious maps without any surprises...\n\nI really wanted to play a WW2 FPS, was bitterly disappointed.","December 26, 2015","false","3.0"," 1 of 14 people (7%) found this review helpful","7","1","14","0","3"

I found the squad manipulation painfully tedious; suppress, flank, wash, rinse, repeat. Trying to smartly move your teams while under mortar fire was even more tedious.

I first played it back when it came out in early 2005, and I remembered the game all of these years and decided to get it again, with all of the BiA games.\n\nIt turns out that this situation is where the nostalgia was better than the actual game (to be honest, that doesn't actually occur as often as people think it does). Back when I first played it, I was a big WW2 game buff, way more than I am now. I think that's the biggest reason why I had such good memories of it.\n\nBut later that year, Call of Duty 2 came out, and looking back (and even looking at right now, since I've played CoD 2 again recently), that game is much better. Out of all of the WW2 games that I've played (and played again recently), I have to say that BiA: Road to Hill 30 has disappointed me now. I loved the Medal of Honor and Call of Duty series about 2007 or 2008 and before. I do NOT like the CoD or MoH series after those years.\n\nMy favorites are Call of Duty 2, Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, and Call of Duty: World at War. Turns out that I enjoy all of them more than I do this game.\n\nTo go into more detail on the game itself, I mostly remembered the characters and what happens, who dies. The game is known for being very historically accurate and also based on real people, but other games are very historically accurate as well. The game is often compared to Band of Brothers, but after having replayed BiA, I would rather watch or read Band of Brothers than play it. Gameplay-wise, the mechanics are rather bad, really, especially in comparison to other games released at the time, especially of CoD 2 which was the exact same year. I snuck up behind soldiers many times in the game and shot them in the face, and they didn't die. Some soldiers I shot point-blank about 5 times before they died.\n\nI can't tell if the mechanics are just from running it on a modern machine or not. I was able to run on Windows 8.1 with no problem whatsoever, no extra installations or settings needed. I also downloaded the popular group of mods for the game, which you can find the forums easily. I would recommend them if you do play.\n\nBut honestly, the only thing that struck me was the cutscenes of the characters dying, because I remembered them dying the exact same way. Those scenes stuck with me, because you are with the same people the whole game, mostly. But in terms of the overall environment or progression through the game, it actually didn't feel as life-like as some of the other better WW2 games.\n\nIt turns out that my own nostalgia overrated the game.","March 29, 2015","false","7.8"," 3 of 19 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","3","19","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OperationalOperator/recommended/15190/","OperationalOperator","Ridah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OperationalOperator/","519 products in account","I got a couple of missions in and this is probably one of the worse WW2 shooters to come out of this time.\n\nThe sound design undermines everything about the game because its just so bad. Voice actors who can't deliver lines with enthusiasm and just come off as a guy talking in a sound studio. Guns that sound ridiculously bad with no oomph with them. These are huge issues. Try to play any good FPS with the sound off and tell me it dousn't effect the game.\n\nMechanics wise its a very poor FPS. Theres no real logic behind how to hit a target or atleast it seems random most the time if shots miss or hit. Shooting with accuracy is impossible from what I have seen especially at far distances as bullets dissappear after a certain distance traveled or atleast it seems like it. Its easier just to run up and hit people or shoot them from feet away.  Your freindly AI have as much trouble, but unlike you their bullets don't just stop existing after a set travel distance. Controls are pretty sucky and overly fluid like aswell but you can get used to them. The game wants you to flank every single time just about and theres pretty much one way to do that right in an area....which isn't fun. Its repatitive and drawn out.\n\nIts really more of a strategy game where you command troops to attack, defend, and flank essentially, in order to remove Krauts from the area. Unfortunately its not a good strategy game either. Freindly AI have a tendency to get themselves killed randomly and in incredible ways. Even if you tell them to follow you, their pathing might lead them face first into a squad of Germans or a grenade. Men Of War titles are far far superior RTT/Strategy games of this style. Part of the reason is that in this game you have to worry about managing your stupid partners (which die for good unless you lose enough times to respawn them) and managing your own life at the same time.\n\nIts also pretty boring. The point where I stopped playing was basically you go around and hit F at a whole bunch of wooden poles in feilds until you move on to the next one. Every time you hit F you do an animation of placing a bomb and theres a bunch of them spread out. Previously to this I was doing similiar but with AA guns. This isn't fun. This is crappy game design.\n\nThe story might be pretty good, but its certinatly not worth wading through sewage. I bet the later games fill in perfectly well anyway.\n\nTL:DR\nJust play COD 1-3, Pre Modern Reboot MOH games, SOCOM PS2 games, or later BIA game (Hells Highway demo was great fun when I played it years ago) because this one just sucks. Im sure it gets "better" later on but the base mechanics I have seen just suck so bad that its guranteed not worth the unfun.\n\nAtleast in COD you don't have to rely on terrible AI team mates who need babysitting.\n\nThe whole time playing this is just thought about what better games I could play that involved AI squad mates and you as the leader. Then I realised I wasn't having fun with this soggy POS and uninstalled it.","April 25, 2015","false","3.4"," 2 of 17 people (12%) found this review helpful","12","2","17","0","2"

My biggest issues with Road to Hill 30 stem from the game design, so if your the kind of person that sees "classic" and "old" as meaning "timeless," you should probably ignore this recomendation.\n\nAiming reliably is a huge pain, to the extent that I found myself relying on my AI squad. Trouble is, the squad AI is so dumb it will walk in front of bullets, throw gernades at your legs, and take cover right on explosives. If you don't do your best to lock your team down, they will freely walk in front of you during a firefight. You can try to coordinate stratigicly through a special top-down mode, but this mode is unreliable for doing more than getting your bearings.\n\nI have rarely so noticed the absence of any ability to stick to cover or sprint. Hell's Highway has both these things, in addition to better aiming, and the severe loss of freedom I felt as I tried despirately to manuver in Road to Hill 30 is so bad its almost funny.\n\nIn the absence of good controls or gameplay, the story has to pick up the slack. Unfortunitely, I knew going into this that I probably wasn't going to like the story. WW2 and the endless massacre of the mostly-white soldiers bores me to death at this point. In other games, the tired WW2 cliches are often mixed up by the introduction of new elements, such as the alternate timeline of the new Wolfenstien. Road to Hill 30 is a full-on historical drama, however, so expect no mercy for non-enthusiasts.\n\nAt the end of the day, you'll probably like this game if you like WW2. Trouble is, Hell's Highway has better gameplay. You will miss out on some of the story if you skip ahead (these games are a fully realized drama, after all), but such is the cost of fun.","July 18, 2014","false","0.8"," 3 of 25 people (12%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","12","3","25","0","0"

If you're looking for a realistic WWII shooter, don't even touch this game.\n\nSometimes this game is easy.. but when it's hard, it's what I call "artificial difficulty". That is, difficulty due to poorly implimented and/or repetative actions, or difficulty due to bad design.\n\nThe checkpoint save system is annoying. It doesn't add challenge to the game. It forces you to re-do the same easy, mundane parts over and over to get past the one odd difficult part. I just spent 10 minutes taking on a pair of Panzer IVs. Tanks in this game are a joke.. find rocket, shoot it ad infinum until it blows up. A Panzer IV should be shredded by a single Panzerfaust. I wouldn't have an issue with the liberties taken here if I could see a point to it, but there isn't any. It isn't "difficult" getting rid of tanks, just time consuming (once you get your squad somewhere where they won't get mowed down). After I killed the one tank, another appears. Wash, rinse, repeat. Then a squadmate kills me with a grenade. Thanks, bro. Checkpoint? 10+ minutes earlier before I dispatched the tanks. That's not difficulty. That's not a challenge. That's tedious. And moments like that happen numerous times throughout the game. Actually, come to think of it, this game is very repetative overall. Every chapter plays out almost the exact same way with slightly different scenary.\n\nThe small maps are atrocious. This game is suppose to be about maneuver and flanking, yet many, many times the maps design is such that it feels like a railed cover shooter more than anything else. Your squad AI is so stupid you end up spending more time babysitting them to make sure they don't do something dumb and get killed than actually PLAYING the game. Many of the maps are too small to actually maneuver realistically, and winning becomes a matter of "gamey" tactics. If you want a game with tactics, play Combat Mission.\n\nAnd the story? Uh.. what story? Maybe it's because I've actually read Band of Brother by Ambrose I'm finding this game incredebly light on the story. I don't give a hoot about any of the characters. Nothing makes me want to like them. If you want the story of the 101st in Europe, go read the book or watch the movies. They're both more entertaining and much heavier on the story than this game.\n\nI can forgive the issues I have with the game because of the technology at the time it was developed. But frankly this just isn't that good of a game. I think a lot of people let the content simply colour their ratings.","November 22, 2014","false","7.5"," 3 of 34 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","3","34","0","0"

Matt Baker and his squad of 101st Airborne Paratroopers are scattered over the French countryside.\nThere are 20 chapters to play through and with the action and story, you'll really want to know whats going to happen next.\n\nControls are easy enough for anyone who has played FPS on PC but it does have a little bit a getting used to. Why? Because player not only controlling Baker, but the squad thats with him. Player control two fire teams and can place one team to place covering and suppressing fire while Baker and the other team flanks the enemies. The game does have a tutorial build in so that player can learn to lead their brothers to victory.\n\nMusic in game is the pretty standard fare of orchestral but the sound FX of the gun fire and squad members yelling at the player were so life like and is really immersive.\n\nThe game just looks great as every house, plant and character are all textured wonderfully and bring the game a gritty realistic feel.\n\nThe only draw back is that the team AI isn't smart enough sometimes and continually says that they can't see or shoot a target and don't move to get a better shot and sometimes gets shot and dies so the strategy part is mandatory most of the time.\n\nReally the game is fast, furious and a blast to play and the story is compelling to continue to the end.\n\n8/10","November 30, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite the age of Road to Hill 30 and Earned in Blood; they still hold up to today's standard of detail and storytelling. This reveiw will be centered on Road to Hill 30. Lets start with the graphics. For it's time, the graphics for this game were average at best, more so today. However, the story and attention to detail balance out how the game looks. It's a classic example of how graphics are not everything. Next, the story. The story is phenominal. 'Nuff said. Although, the ending is a bit disapointing. Let's move on to characters, the most important aspect in this game. You play as Sgt. Mattew Baker; a reluctant squad leader of the 502'nd U.S Airborne. As you are a squad leader, you obviously command your own group of soldiers. I won't spoil anything for you, but you will find yourself screaming: "NOOOOOOOOO" many times. Each and every character is memorable, and you care about the lives of your men more than yourself. Bottom line; This is a fantastic game, and I would absoloutly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an authentic, and nostalgic WW2 experience.","November 4, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This story however follows that of Matt Baker, a soldier of the 101st Airborne division, whom seems out of place somewhat and lacking the experience of what is ultimately to become his role, being a leader. In this installment, he is trying to figure it all out as well as his team members in accordance to their characteristics and traits, even his own. Matt Baker seems to be quite lost within himself as well as the start of this war he has entered, which is based on a true story as depicted, so that alone to me is motivation because you follow in his footsteps of that time. Soon Baker however realizes that he will be the most trusted and relied on pillar of leadership to his men. In order to appreciate the next two installments of this game you have to play this one to understand who he is and watch/learn how he matures with experience in the fields of battle. This is a title that puts emphasis on turning boys into men. In terms of graphics, don't expect next gen, it was released in 2005 however smooth and fluid when playing with realistic sounds, npc verbal activity and interaction,great fighting action and explosive,iconic and historical places to visit on mission. The storyline and gameplay however will quickly distract you from that issue of graphical realism as its a shooter that is based on the choices you make and for you and your men, not just a simple run and gun. I highly recommend this game as its a lasting title of its class.","November 25, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djdeeplube/recommended/15190/","djdeeplube","President Camacho","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djdeeplube/","200 products in account","A phenomenal tactical shooter that still holds today. This game actually captures the feel of WWII combat, unlike Call of Duty or Medal of Honor, which simply are shooters set in WWII. The squad mechanics are deep yet extremely simple to learn and use, and the enemy AI is some of the best I've ever seen. The combat model is very realistic, with weapon recoil keeping the player from running and gunning most of the time. The health system is one of the most original things about the game; instead of you losing health gradually before dying, the game accumulates danger based on how close you are to an enemy firing, and when the danger reaches a certain level, you get shot and die. This mitigates much of the frustration involved with waiting for your health to regenerate, and establishes a realistic disparity between how much danger you're in engaging enemies close up and far away. The sound design is also ridiculously good, with patriotic melodies that really bring out that "Murica" feel to the game, and convincing weapon noises that make you feel like you're shooting a gun. I only have two problems with the game. One is that the visuals have not aged well at all, and even for 2005 this game looks meh. The other is that sometimes I found my shots being blocked by invisible cover boundaries even though I had my sights on the enemy's helmet; this is likely a contrivance designed to make the player use flanking tactics, but it was still annoying.","June 25, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This story however follows that of Matt Baker, a soldier of the 101st Airborne division, whom seems out of place somewhat and lacking the experience of what is ultimately to become his role, being a leader. In this installment, he is trying to figure it all out as well as his team members in accordance to their characteristics and traits, even his own. Matt Baker seems to be quite lost within himself as well as the start of this war he has entered, which is based on a true story as depicted, so that alone to me is motivation because you follow in his footsteps of that time. Soon Baker however realizes that he will be the most trusted and relied on pillar of leadership to his men. In order to appreciate the next two installments of this game you have to play this one to understand who he is and watch/learn how he matures with experience in the fields of battle. This is a title that puts emphasis on turning boys into men. In terms of graphics, don't expect next gen, it was released in 2005 however smooth and fluid when playing with realistic sounds, npc verbal activity and interaction,great fighting action and explosive,iconic and historical places to visit on mission. The storyline and gameplay however will quickly distract you from that issue of graphical realism as its a shooter that is based on the choices you make and for you and your men, not just a simple run and gun. I highly recommend this game as its a lasting title of its class.","November 25, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite the age of Road to Hill 30 and Earned in Blood; they still hold up to today's standard of detail and storytelling. This reveiw will be centered on Road to Hill 30. Lets start with the graphics. For it's time, the graphics for this game were average at best, more so today. However, the story and attention to detail balance out how the game looks. It's a classic example of how graphics are not everything. Next, the story. The story is phenominal. 'Nuff said. Although, the ending is a bit disapointing. Let's move on to characters, the most important aspect in this game. You play as Sgt. Mattew Baker; a reluctant squad leader of the 502'nd U.S Airborne. As you are a squad leader, you obviously command your own group of soldiers. I won't spoil anything for you, but you will find yourself screaming: "NOOOOOOOOO" many times. Each and every character is memorable, and you care about the lives of your men more than yourself. Bottom line; This is a fantastic game, and I would absoloutly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an authentic, and nostalgic WW2 experience.","November 4, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When they pull him from the water, they think he is dead, but when he opens his mouth, the pilot has a fit. The hermit prays, and the Mariner picks up the oars to row. The pilot's boy goes crazy and laughs, thinking the Mariner is the devil, and says, "The Devil knows how to row." As penance for shooting the albatross, the Mariner, driven by guilt, is forced to wander the earth, tell his story, and teach a lesson to those he meets:\nHe prayeth best, who loveth best All things both great and small; For the dear God who loveth us, He made and loveth all.\nAfter relating the story, the Mariner leaves, and the Wedding Guest returns home, and wakes the next morning "a sadder and a wiser man".","February 20","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a decent storyline (considering how limited WW2 is in terms of plot) and has a good range of level formats. The script and voice acting are decent and the music is well composed and fittingly marshal. The AI is a little awkward at times, and the squads don't quite seem to understand what you want them to do.
