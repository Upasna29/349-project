I already held it in extremely high regard pre-0.8 and had taken plenty of time to master the game - And then boom. A complete overhaul of the aero, tyre and suspension models. Why? Because the community said the handling didn't feel quite right.\nThey decided to then cram some equipment into a van and drive all the way to Barcelona from the UK to get some more feedback from the real world RX drivers, to help pinpoint where improvements could be made.\nIf this doesn't show some real dedication to the early access model and prove that they're actively striving to make this the best rally game ever made, i really don't know what could change your mind.\n\nDiRT Rally v0.8 has managed to become my favourite all time game - Taking the throne from my childhood SNES classics and there's still more to come! I honestly can't find words to say how good the feeling of finding a perfect game and having a reliable stream of updates that just improve it further, really is.\n\nThis deserves a perfect 10/10 and i'm sure by version 1.0 it will be damn close.","October 1, 2015","true","713.2"," 387 of 400 people (97%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","97","387","400","10","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shmupperfromhell/recommended/310560/","shmupperfromhell","Daz of the Shire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shmupperfromhell/","266 products in account","This is my Early Access review after putting some considerable hours into the game, playing various game modes while keeping a close eye on the community, the devs and updates.\n\nI would like to point out unequivocally to any existing DiRT fans: this is NOT DiRT 4, or anything close to what most everyone would consider a "DiRT" game/title. To be honest I'm not even sure why CM used the "DiRT" prefix at all, because there is literally no baring to that name except they are both rally games.\n\nThere is no "loudness" or "bro yeah" in this game. No convoluted menu's that take 30 minutes to decipher. You are not forced to sit through tedious sound-bites of some jumped up prick telling you how to drive... I'm getting carried away. The point is this in not DiRT, this is something else!\n\nMany people have been calling for CodeMasters to go back to the glory days of rally games (MCrae) for years, and it seems they have not only listened at last, but delivered also. It's a sim, it's tough, and by gawd does it scare you to death!\n\nI should probably give some Pro's 'n' Con's at this point:\n\nPROS: It's a Rally Sim! Make a wrong move and your family will be placing flowers against a remote tree for years to come.\nAs it should be, it is tough! Rally driving is the most demanding style of driving in the world, this is too.\nPlenty of cars, each with individual sounds, handling and tuning. They all feel different.\nThe SOUND. No game has EVER come close to this. The sound in this game is mind blowing! From the individual engine sounds (you MUST hear them) to the gravel hitting your bodywork, to the perfect shifting, to the bad shifting... EVERYTHING.\nMenu's are sleek, to the point and very fast.\nCONS: Still favors wheels a LOT more over gamepads at present, although you can still compete with one (a gamepad) if determined. This has been addressed. Gamepads are now much more configurable!\nThere is a long standing problem with nVidia MOBILE graphics cards in that you cannot go Fullscreen. Fixed.\nThere is a bug that if you do not have a certain amount of GB free space (2-4GB) on your system drive, the game will fail to launch. TBH though everyone should have that at least!\nEven as Early Access this is still one of, if not the best racing game i've ever played and I have stated many times that "racing games are too easy, therefore i dislike them". With this game I have been well and truely slapped around the face!.\n\nIf you like sims I recommend, if you like rally racing I recommend, if you like a genuine challenge I recommend.\n\nIf you like easy wins, easy AI, easy life and easy achievements - you lookin' at the wrong game.\n\nThis is for the determined, for the persistent, for the fighter, for those that "quitting" is a cuss word.\n\nTo those people i rate it: Highly Recommended\n\nEDIT (Dec 2015): With many additions in terms of tracks and vehicles, FFB improvements, gamepad improvements, UI improvements and much more, I stand by my initial conclusion - this is one of, if not the best rally game ever made.","July 8, 2015","true","131.6"," 236 of 239 people (99%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","99","236","239","14","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/supernaut/recommended/310560/","supernaut","supernaut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/supernaut/","241 products in account","Encouragement Edition\nSo far I've put 31 hours into DiRT Rally, which is nothing really, since it took me roughly 30 hours to be able to drive confidently. Now that it's out of Early Access and despite glowing reviews from that period, I want to offer words of encouragement to those who have no experience with rally simulation games. My experience with rally sims is literally that, 31 hours. For a long time I thought my big brother was kinda crazy with his Richard Burn Rally, GT Legends and what have you. I stayed away from his racing sims, cos I knew I wouldn't be able to compete with his stage times. So instead we got competitive in games like NFS: High Stakes (the Snowy Ridge stage in particular) and the old Colin McRae Rally games, which had enough arcade handling for me to be able to compete with him. Naturally he played with assists off, where available. I on the other hand wouldn't even know how to begin to setup my car, let alone understand how turning off certain assists would translate into the handling of the car. And I pretty much still don't. For someone my age, I've driven very little in real life, but my mechanically inclined big brother knew exactly what he was doing back then. So most of the time he was kicking my ♥♥♥, both in and out of the games. I keed, I keed.\n\nMy immediate conclusion after the first few hours with DiRT Rally was that I had no clue how to drive. A drunk elephant skating on ice would have more finesse. While I didn't rage-quit as often as I was expecting to, at the start I was playing only in third person view, thinking that my experience with the NFS, GTA or Colin McRae Rally games would help me here. It didn't. What I soon realized was that an outside view of my driving made me too aware of the track, which is probably just me, but that coupled with racing sim handling spelled disaster for me. So either by brazen choice or through cunning design, I chose the cockpit view to complete an entire stage, which I had never done in any racing game before. Sure, I've toggled it on and off here and there, but I had never stuck with it until now. This had an interesting effect on my driving, cos I was assessing the track and my line of driving more by feel than by actually seeing the track from above. I mean besides listening to your co-driver, which is important if you want to win. All that said, I think it's a good idea to put some 30 hours into it before you drift off to other games, cos being an FPS guy mostly and after taking long breaks from it, I was essentially starting afresh every time I returned. Even if your skills are still there, the stage conditions from Wales to Greece will bring you back to earth in no time.\n\nRecently I graduated to Clubman, which means you'll do 6 stages per race and have 2 opportunities to repair your car. While my initial reaction was "oh no, I want to do more races with 4 stages before I move on," which I assume you still can in custom races, but once you've qualified there's no reason to go back. You've earned your place here. It doesn't matter if you finished 3rd, 2nd or first, or think you got lucky. While there's always an element of luck in any game, DiRT Rally will never meet you halfway, it will never hold your hand and even though a beginner like myself will have assists on for the foreseeable future, the game will teach you what you need in order to progress. Practice will take you where you want to go.\n\nDiRT Rally is an elegant product, the menus are simple and the soundtrack is smooth, as you get ready for the next stage/race or manage your team. I imagine the Early Access feedback had a lot to do with making it as enjoyable as possible, both on and off the track. This being my first racing game with achievements, the 170 achievements it now has is an additional motivator to get better at it. I'm really glad they included them and that they keep adding them with updates. If I were to offer feedback of my own, I hope to see an Estonian flag among the spectators someday. I also want to congratulate Codemasters in getting it right and returning to their roots. I've missed you immensely.","December 23, 2015","true","35.4"," 189 of 198 people (95%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","95","189","198","14","16"

Codemasters were good drivers, listening to the co-pilots who gave feedback during development.\nApart from that, the most authentic rally game since Colin McRae Rally and Richard Burns Rally. It can please both casuals driving 60's cars in Monte Carlo with assists enabled, and hardcore drivers going through Pikes Peak at high speed from start to finish.\n\nWhat other reviewers say is damn right. Best and most challenging rally game in years, realistic driving (even though physics might not be the best), great immersion, technically beautiful in almost every way and many classic and modern cars to drive. Career mode is simple, yet effective which encourages you to drive each car and upgrade them overtime, then there's player-versus-player Rallycross and online leaderboard rally and hillclimb to prove your worth.\nI won't recommend playing online other than to earn credits though.

You like realistic cars flying over ♥♥♥♥♥y roads that will punish you for your mistakes...but won't kill you for them like an actual car would? Read on.\n\n\nTwo things first. This game requires a DirectX 11-capable GPU, and there is an achievement for having played the game in Early Access. I don't know if it'll prevent 100% completion, but it is a thing.\n\nApart from that, this is 100% recommended for rally fans, and anybody who isn't afraid of a challenge. DiRT Rally is the fundamental opposite of DiRT Showdown, and it shows. Excellent physics (Codemasters' most realistic to date), truly awesome sound, breath-taking graphics, oodles of cars and a great variety of locations already. Between the career, multiplayer (with leagues!), fully customizable modes, achievements, and aforementioned car/track variety, there is a lot of value here.\n\nRally is predicated less on being the best right from the start and more around improving yourself as you go, gradually pushing yourself forward. Which is good, because this game really does simulate rally, and it is unforgiving. New players, trust me when I say you will screw up and it will probably be frustrating - because I sure feel it! And that's okay, because improving yourself in this game is truly rewarding, and driving itself is more often than not its own reward. Hell, veteran drivers aren't always perfect either. This game is quite possibly the most elegant combination of game and simulator I've ever seen.\n\nThe community will probably tell you to turn off all the driving aids from the start, but they're there for a reason. One must learn to walk before they can run, so I would suggest incrementally turning them off whenever you feel comfortable enough to. Or...not. How you use this game's remarkably wide-ranging realism/aid preferences are up to you.\n\nIf there's any criticism to be had of this game, it's that you kind of need a controller or wheel to really get the most out of your vehicle, and you will need to push your vehicle that far eventually.\n\nThe career progression is also rather impersonal: you mainly interact with the championships via sterile menus. I'd like to see my car in the service area so I can look at its damage in detail. I'd also like to see showcases for the cars, complete with short videos and historical information for people deciding which car to buy. The presentation is still good, but it's kind of impersonal for a representation of rally. I'd like to see something more like what's described in this special-interest review[www.worldrallyblog.com]:\n\n"Off the top of my head, the rally game that best captured the atmosphere of a real rally was Codemaster’s Colin McRae Rally 3. Through the clever use of cut-scenes, the game made you feel like you were really competing in a rally rather than just completing a list of stages. Before starting a special stage, you saw the car in front of you launch off the starting line in a cloud of dust. Then, you would watch your car pull up to the time control and your co-driver exchange the time card with the rally marshals. Between stages, there were scenes of the service park with mechanics working on the car. While simple, these scenes helped to build the anticipation of every special stage and made you feel like you were involved in a live rally. Including similar scenes in Dirt Rally would contribute greatly to the immersion and atmosphere that is currently lacking in the current build of the game. In addition to cut-scenes, menu design is a simple and inexpensive way to add to the immersion. At the moment, the menu interface in Dirt Rally does the job, but adds nothing to the rally experience. With a good graphic artist, Codemasters could transform Dirt Rally’s forgettable menus into something meaningful and memorable. For example, what if Codemasters presented the stages for a particular rally in the format of a real rally roadbook? Using some simple 2-dimensional graphics, the menu could resemble a spiral bound notebook with stage maps, start times and road surface information. It would be a simple addition that would add the atmosphere of a real-life rally to the game."\n\nThe devs did add video tutorials after I and others said the game could use them, which gives me hope for the other stuff I mentioned. Real world rally advice actually carries over to this game anyhow, and that's worth cool points if anything.\n\n\nI'll leave you with a few basic pointers:\n\n* Slower is often faster! It's better to downshift to drift around a corner than slam on the brakes to avoid crashing your car.\n* On that note, rally is as much about finesse as it is about having a lead foot - in other words attempting to maintain a level of control. Learn to use momentum to your advantage around corners.\n* Throttle control is important, but it's much more important with RWD cars. If you step on it all the time, you're going to spin out all the time.\n* You're going to need a certain level of concentration to absorb your co-driver's course notes and keep the car on the road. The course notes are what let rally drivers really push themselves forward with confidence.\n* The helmet camera, for what it's worth, helps me drive better sometimes. Either way, it's awesome.\n* If all else fails, you should probably slow down.\n* If that fails, blame the mechanic.","October 23, 2015","true","32.7"," 97 of 102 people (95%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","95","97","102","18","0"

Seriously playing this with no HUD, all assists off, and just your co-driver instructions for guidance (who you actually need to listen to now where I felt you could ignore in Dirt 3 with its tracks wider than they are long) It just feels so right and so immersive I'd love to try it with Rift.\n\nEven driving the starting Mini I feel there's so much room for improvement in my own game to cut down on my times which is going to take so much much hours of practice to perfect. It's not often I have felt out of depth with realism (even after playing Assetto Corsa, Race series, GT5 etc).. and I LOVE it!\n\nI ain't even mad I finished 4th after completing my first rally, I was a minute off pace overall (2 track recoveries, an early start penalty and several restarts due to me missing the co-driver's instructions causing me to brake heavy, lock up the wheels and head straight into a tree or three).. Had this have been Dirt 3 I would have restarted until I nailed the perfect run as the stages were so short you didn't really need commit yourself to each run but I felt like I drove as best I could to my current ability, there's not milliseconds between the race positions but usually 10's of seconds and could even be a minute which I like very much and find a refreshing take and really shows the skill involved in consistent driving over many long stages, every crash or scrape can become crucial as the stages progress as you may not have time to fix the damage between stages hindering your cars performance in the long run.\n\nIt's definitely difficult to finish first but I don't feel cheated as I could see myself where I was losing time this only inspires me to play more and get better, challenge IS what I'm looking for in my sims.\n\nThere's already a decent selection of cars spanning all era's and some tracks that feel right at home for rally nerds. I can't wait to see what the future brings for this sim, any sim enthusiasts that are on the fence I beg you to at least try this game for a very reasonable price and support this it may give you a reason to let RBR have a rest for a while.\n\nSome improvements I would like to see is more debris, loose gravel, mud, anything to make the track surface not look so perfectly smooth, and the spectators are very low poly models, but can't fault the majority of visuals.\n\nMod support to keep this game fresh after the DLC cycles have expired (track generator/community tracks would be suffice also)\n\nAlthough basic Multiplayer in the form of Online Leaderboards/Leagues are already implemented I do hope Real Time Multiplayer is planned even if it's just in the same form as CM with simultaneous/staggered timed runs against friends.\n\nFinal Note - This does not play like your "usual" early access game, the actual gameplay is as polished you would expect from a full release candidate I have experienced a few hard lockups on the menu and the BGM can get repititve quick, but overall had it not been for the lack of additional content which is yet to come (cars, tracks,modes) you wouldn't even consider this early access compared to a lot of other steam titles on gameplay alone.\n\nHardware\nLogitech F510 Controller (no configuring necessary), will try out the old G27 when it gets closer to release (other reviews have stated FFB isn't yet upto standard).\nGTX 980 - Game runs silky smooth 100+ fps on Ultra, good optimization and good to be on the forefront of development rather than getting a lazy port.\n\nTL:DR Not for the faint hearted, as a sim..

Yes it is!!! It's awesome to finally be able to play a true rally game after all these years. The controls are definitely far away from the arcade-ish one of Dirt 1,2,3.

The DiRT series has made a full 180 hairpin turn from the stylized arcade mayhem, straigh for the crown of rally sims, a genre that has had no interesting releases for quite some time. It's hard, it's scary, it's messy, it's rally.\n\nDiRT Rally is not perfect though. It could have a deeper career mode, there could be a more varied multiplayer experience, the cars could (or should) take more damage on hard impacts, the pacenotes could have better pacing and the replay system is just plain bad at the moment. That being said, the weird panic induced zenlike mode I get in to every single time at the beginning of a stage, when the countdown reaches zero, is something beyond words. Shaving off the seconds from your time at the edge of control while navigating the icy narrow mountain roads or dodging trees and rocks in a dark forrest is a real treat.\n\nThe sim is still on early access though, and I can't wait for the improvements we're going to see in the future. Early access or not, there's still a lot of good to be said here. The graphics, sounds, handling, car selection, stages and the mood in general are all top notch.\n\nCan you tell that I'm excited? Because I am. And I can't stop racing. If you are a sim racer craving for a rally experience, this might be something worth checking out right now.\n\nI just hope that Codemasters Racing Studio respects the sim racing community enough and doesn't mock up the final product, turning it in to another DiRT 3 due to public pressure.\n\n\nTL;DR - I love it!","April 30, 2015","true","33.8"," 67 of 71 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","67","71","3","0"

It preserves the good memories of games past, whilst erasing the bad. It makes you forget all the little things you hated about a game, and convinces you the thing you loved was perfect. What has this got to do with DiRT Rally, I hear you ask. Well, its about expectation, and the ghost of the original Colin McRae Rally. I spent many, many hours hooked up to my PlayStation playing that game. I perfected every line, honed every set up. If I close my eyes now, I can still conjure up images of New Zealand's stages. Colin McRae Rally is indelibly marked upon my brain, and ever since then I searched for a rally game with the same feeling.\n\nI've enjoyed the Dirt games over the years, but I think its fair to say the game had drifted a fair way from it's roots. Yes, they were fun, but they never really recaptured that sense of tearing through a stage, whilst being one mistake away from total disaster. Easier handling and a flashback button removed the sense of jeopardy, and with it came the removal of that epic sense of beating the terrain. The endless effort to make the game more accesible watered down the sense of excitement. No longer were you flying by the seat of your pants. Going off-line, and hitting a tree was a mistake you could fix. In short, it no longer felt like that rally game I first played all those years ago.\n\nDiRT Rally does away with the safety blanket. And whilst that may render the game less accesible to a wider audience, it does mean that the feeling is back. Every time-gain will have to be earned. Every mistake will cost you dear. Success behind the wheel will require skill, and a knowledge of how a car behaves on the various different surfaces. Listening to the pace notes is essential, as is knowing when to push, and when to not. Forget about what came before, and put on your big-boy trousers, 'cause Dirt Rally takes no prisoners.\n\nI could praise this game for many reasons, but I'll leave it at this; from the very first moment I played DiRT Rally, I felt like the series was back where it belonged. I felt like I was sitting in my bedroom again, playing the game I loved so long ago.\nFinally, Colin McRae Rally has a worthy successor.

Laughable! I'm a good driver in real life - at least far better than those other 95% of morons moving their cars on the streets - and I already have some hours in other racing sims. So can't be that tough, eh?" Bought DiRT Rally, plugged in my wheel, created a custom event in Wales, "Uh, Group B cars. Nice!", picked the Lancia Delta S4, 5-4-3-2-1 ... full throttle ... went off the track in the 1st corner... "For real??? Ok, bad luck. Next try!" On my 5th try I eventually managed the 1st corner but flew off into the forest due to a bump right before the 2nd corner. Unlocked the "Mondays Be Like..." achievement.\n\n"Ok, haha, a 480 - 650hp car on gravel may indeed be a little bit overambitious to begin with." Selected a 2010' 300hp Ford Fiesta, same stage in Wales. Flew off in the first corner again...\n\nAbout half an hour and several attempts later: "The game is still early access. I'm sure there are some bugs left in the physics engine..." Google didn't bring up a single hit.\n\nStumbled upon this vid while googling for known bugs. Got severely depressed. Didn't touch DiRT Rally for a month.\n\nAccidentally found some basic tutorials. First recommendation: Start with a 1960 car! "Drive a >50 year old 100hp Mini Cooper? Me? Yeah... Sure!" Went on reading the tutorials anyhow. "Weight transfer... Left foot breaking ... Effectively reducing speed by using the side walls of the tyres ... Scandinavian flick ..." "Wow! I had no idea..."\n\nStarted the career with the 1960' Mini Cooper... Finished my very first stage with 3 crashes, 1 flat tyre and more than 3 mins behind.\n\nAbout 80h in the game now I'm back to the Group B and 2010' cars. If I have a really good day and if I manage to stay focused (processing the visual input from the road directly ahead of me and working the pedals & wheel to keep control over that beast of a car while simultaneously listening to my co-driver and mentally preparing for the 2 upcoming corners based on his pacenotes) and with a little bit of luck I may be able to finish a masters event without restart, but then somewhere around 4th to 8th place. With some restarts I may be able to win an event. Being able to finish an event among the top 3 without restarts? Still a long way to go... ;-)\nFinally, have I become a better driver in real life? No, I don't think so. But I gained an aweful lot more respect for professional racing drivers and especially rally drivers. Watching motorsports with completely different eyes now. Well, and sometimes I discover myself coursing a bit less about those other 95% of real world drivers... ;-)\n\n11/10 for a game which can be so frustrating yet rewarding at the same time. Words can't tell the feeling of a clean stage win after hours of practice. If you enjoy racing sims and if you think you are a good driver, this game may attack your ego from time to time, but it keeps you practicing, learning and improving.

In DiRT Rally you get behind the wheel of some of the best rally cars from the past few decades ranging from the 1960 Mini Cooper to the Ford Fiesta all on tight tracks winding in and out of mountains, going through ice patches and taking you around precarious hairpins. You may be put off by the name DiRT when talking about a sim but Rally is not like the previous DiRT games, Codemasters have removed arcade features such as flashback and have made it a far more serious game, helping it to become what is already a fantastic racing sim.\n\nBefore I get into the main part of my review I just want to point out that I have no previous experience with Rally games and I played DiRT Rally with a 360 controller, not a wheel.\n\n+Fantastic graphics, even when you're not playing on Ultra it still looks great\n+Great driving physics, I'm no expert on the physics behind rally racing but they feel pretty realistic to me\n+DiRT Rally really captures the pressure of rally racing as you constantly have to battle with your car so it doesn't go off the edge of a cliff, or maybe it's just because I suck at racing games\n+Already 36 different stages across 3 locations to try out (with more to be added)\n+Weather conditions and time of days can be customised completely when creating a custom event\n+14 high quality cars across 6 classes which are currently available (with more to be added)\n+Good damage models\n+All of the cars have different liveries for you to choose from and use\n+Excellent co-driver who is very helpful once you actually understand what he's saying\n+Very challenging\n+You can hire engineers to work for you who will upgrade your car and work on it between stages\n+In-depth tuning system though it's only for people who really know what they're doing\n+You can create custom events where all cars are available as well as compete in the championship mode\n+Simplistic menu and UI\n+Multiple camera angles from both in and outside the car\n+Great soundeffects\n\n-No form of tutorial whatsoever, not even any text descriptions. As someone who has no experience with rally this made getting into the game incredibly difficult as I had no idea what my co-driver was saying\n-Nothing major but the windshield wipers are automatic and can be rather distracting when they suddenly turn on even when your windshield isn't wet\n-Seeing as I don't have a wheel I haven't experienced this myself but from what I understand from other reviewers the force feedback in the game isn't good at all\n\nVerdict:\n9\n\nDiRT Rally is already a fantastic, challenging racing sim with fantastic graphics, great physics, a fair few cars and stages and great soundeffects.\n\n***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***\n\nEl K.","May 13, 2015","true","7.6"," 86 of 104 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","86","104","0","10"

Previous enjoyment of the series is not indicative to how much satisfaction you'll find here. Closer to a simulation than an arcade experience and precise in nature, it could be a tough sell for some DiRT fans. If you enjoy Rally driving, then all you need is patience and unwavering concentration. Difficult tracks, cars that are hard to master and an emphasis on endurance are all part of the reason why DiRT Rally is a great entry in the franchise. Drivers will be pushed to their limits both physically and mentally. It includes a decent number of Rally tracks in different settings that require many hours to master. Same can be said for the vehicles, which handle superbly. Unfortunately the supporting content is fairly shallow, with the Hillclimb and Rallycross modes struggling to justify their inclusion. There is no online rally competition either, with Rallycross being a poor and flawed substitute. Pay no mind though, because as the name implies this game lives and breathes Rally driving. It builds immense satisfaction as you make corners with precision and promotes consistency as you finish events without a scratch.

Because the +ve reviews which convinced me it was brilliant and worth a try also seemed to universally say this is HARD.\n\nAnd they were right. On both counts. And after a while playing and crashing many, many cars, I actually see both as plus points.\n\nPut it like this; this game is not only going to see me shortly ditch my new shiney XBox Elite controller and get my G25 wheel out of retirement, but is also is making me seriously consider splashing out an additional ~£300 for another monitor and GFX card for a 3-monitor display. Yes; it really is that good.\n\nIf you've liked rally games before and have a decent spec PC, you'd frankly be daft not to get this.\n\nYes; it's quite challenging, and if you're a mediocre player/rallyer like me, you can probably expect not to win anything for quite a long time. But actually, the overal curve seems to be pretty fair. Even if you don't actually win, outright losing is also pretty hard, provided you can at least keep moving vaguely along the track.\n\nThe majority of tracks I've seen so far are just beautifully done. By far the most interesting in any rally game I've ever tried. And the co-driver navigation is simply brilliant. Sometimes so much information, and so fast that you are still trying to interpret instructions pertaining to 3 turns ago.\n\nIn short; get it. And a decent wheel. And (at least) 3 monitors. And a new sound system. And a pneumatic seat. And an even better PC (or blade array). And a spare garage to put it all in. And a ticket booth outside to charge people to have a go on it.

Where previous titles were pretty much arcade, this is a whole lot more towards sim. It really takes some getting used to. Braking in the middle of a turn is a real no-go, just like how it would be in real life.\n\nBecause braking in turns is a no-go you really have to be a whole lot more cautious going into turns, making the whole game a whole lot more difficult and more fun.\n\nyou can't magically turn back time anymore, so when you've flipped your car you really flipped it, there is no turning back.\n\nThis challenge makes the game much more real, the challenges of rallying are very much present, take caution going in and out of turns and listen good to your co-driver.\n\nThe game runs exceptionally well(just like every other codies game). I'm not sure if this game runs on the new version of the Ego-engine.\n\nThe two stages I have played were around 4mins long, which is okay. The stages feel much tighter, and there is a real danger in going slightly off track as rocks, dips and bumps are very much present. Based on my two runs stage design seems to be a whole lot better than previous DiRT games(and maybe even the original).\n\nOverall, I'd say it is a very worthy successor of the original DiRT, maybe even better. As it's early access I'm certain a whole lot more will be coming up(for example Hillclimb is present as "coming soon"), so watch this title.\n\nBased on my half-hour of gameplay I'd say it's definitely worth it's money(it's priced lower than a full triple-A release)","April 27, 2015","true","21.2"," 59 of 65 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","59","65","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueMongoose/recommended/310560/","BlueMongoose","Cobalt Mongoose Interspeed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueMongoose/","626 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThere’s nothing like flying down a dirt road sliding around corners and missing edges by inches. Its seat of the pants driving in the extreme.\n\nRally-sport is one of the last untamed racing types in existence. To me its baffling why the sport is not more popular. Im looking forward to attending my first local one next spring. A number of years ago after dirt showdown came out I was so disappointed by the offering I did a google search for rumors about the next dirt game when I came across a extensive survey(8 pages long) for what I wanted in the next dirt game. The nature of the questions were thorough and specific as far as authenticity and most of all realistic simulation vs arcade racing. After taking the survey I was super existed told fellow racing friends about it. But years went by and nothing... 9months ago codies said they were removing the dreaded GFWL from dirt 3 and making it a steamworks game. Time went by and I thought its fate was the same as the survey I took. Then in time for my birthday for this year we got Dirt 3 Complete. Then I was blown away because not long after dirt 3 came this gem.\n\nMuch longer tracks that have way more bends and curves with a track width barely wide enough to get the car past. If you play this like dirt3 you will not get far. There is no green line assist showing you where to go. Instead you have cards that pop up before you telling you the about the corner ahead and an audio prompt from your co-driver. I play with no HUD on and listen to my co-drivers calls. It takes along time to learn the stages but its super rewarding when you do.\n\nIf you are looking for a casual but fun experience I highly recommend dirt3. If you don’t have a Dx input device like a wheel or game pad I would recommend you hold off buying this as I imagine it would be quite frustrating.\n\nIf you have played dirt 3 or  other rally games and you want a challenge I whole hardheartedly recommend this title.\n\nEven though its early access , it comes out in mostly complete slices. The communication with the community has been excellent going as far as doing a little hour long twitch show to show off the new content and Q&A. They have listened to the community and delivered changes  that were within their ability.\n\nIf your a wheel user like me you will appreciate that was one of their first big fixes was to rip out the cheesy 270 deg wheel setting and give us proper 900 deg. Track Ir support from previous titles is still present and the drivers view positions are really good even if you cant adjust it.  they set the bar when it comes to communication and feedback for early acess.\n\nI see reviews saying the graphics are bad looking dull and muddy, frankly these people don’t know what they are talking about. A lot of modern games use filters and fx to make things look super high fidelity and detailed. You wold never see the world this way when bombing down a dirt road at 45mph. And when the weather effects kick in its quite realistic.\n\nI’m able to run this on ultra with my R9280x the only time I get sub 60fps is if I run screen cap and steam streaming simultaneously.\n\nIf you are a wheel using motor sport enthusiast I highly recommend this.","July 21, 2015","true","217.6"," 48 of 49 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","48","49","0","3"

The physics in this game are unreal; track surface is an actual, breathing thing; damage is amazingly accurate with every piece of the vehicle taking both external and internal damage (and requires repairs in-between event stages); and things you wouldn't even think of are all taken into consideration (for example: the engine putting out less BHP because of the thinner atmosphere in the high-altitude Pike's Peak as you Hill Climb it in real-time.. O.o ).\n\nIf you're looking for a no-nonsense, hardcore racing sim, nothing beats this game.

No more Ken Block and his Benihana! Challenging, narrow and unforgiving tracks is what awaits you here, just what you'd expect from a Rally game. Though this does seem to take it one step farther in upping the difficulty, the terrain jerks the weel and you can feel the weight and power of the cars.\n\n+ Realistic handling.\n+ Proper car setup (dampening, suspension, break bias etc)\n+ The Co-Driver sounds better than he ever has, alot less like a robot. He even sounds like he's riding a car on rough and bumpy terrain.\n+ The overall audio is stellar, from engine sounds to stones hitting your car as you go barreling down gravel roads.\n+ Cockpit view with adjustable FoV\n\n- The graphics, while serviceable do look really dull, what is it with devs and their love of washed out colorless nature?\n\nThis is without a doubt the most polished early access game I've ever seen, I left out the obvious lack of content cause y'know, early access. And I'm sure the minor stuff will be cleaned up soon enough.\n\nWhile it may not have mass appeal like its predecessors, its target audience will be more than pleased.\nThis is pure Rally joy, it's what you've been waiting for if you have even a remote interest in the sport.

Please, try your best not to hold the recent Grid releases against the Codie's. To me it seems they learned an invaluable lesson from those two racers, and they're most definitely back on the correct course to listening to their player base. The early access, albeit long, was instrumental in making this game what we've come to expect from Codemasters.  I highly doubt you will be dissapointed in purchasing this gem! While a wheel will definitely make the experience more enjoyable, because the use of a clutch and the ability to hold specific gears does make a difference in Rally Racing. This is still a game, and sure you can setup manual gear usage with a controller but it actually takes away from your time, in my opinion. However, I've played with a wheel and controller. I found the game to still be highly enjoyable regardless of either method, yet I do not recommend using the keyboard, hehe. While it's not a full on simulation type experience this isn't a keyboard friendly game unless you could care less about trying to beat your friend's times and, or attempts to beat your previous best times.\n\nWhile not the best review (I'll leave that to the pro's) I hope this gives someone assistance as to whether or not this game is worth your hard earned dollars. I generally wait for a 50% plus off sale of many AAA games nowadays, but this is certainly not one of them!\n\nAddendum: I should have written this 'review' after playing the release version, instead of going by the early access game, because the release version 1.0 is definitely a different beast. Anyhow, my thoughts have not changed overall. Yet, there are significant changes that I won't get into  as "TL:DR" as is... but I definitely take back the controller thoughts concerning the gearbox. The 'quick clutch' feature is most impressive for controller users under an automatic gearbox!

Seriously tho, it's so much better to actually be able to enjoy a realistic looking rally track, instead of the half a mile wide stages in Dirt 3. It's a welcoming feature that I greatly enjoy and really helps with the sense of speed.\n\nThe tracks are also far more densely populated with vegetation - the ones in Wales especially and some of the higher parts in Greece. I actually felt as if I was racing through a forest and It definetly helps with the immersion.\n\nThe track surface is also far more varied in terms of texture and it feels way more bumby than previous Dirts. Cars no longer soak up potholes and uneven surfaces as if they weigh 20kgs. Really good job there.\n\n- The cars themselves were always really well modeled in Codemasters games and this one is no exception, sounds are epic and violent, damage model is good, accumulating dirt on the car etc. No surprise here.\n\n- Co-driver is finally helpful, insted of just riding shotgun and chillin' (although, the abscence of a mini map forces you to listen to the guy, no complaint here, I've always wanted to learn how to read pace notes)\n\n- The abscence of a minimap, definetly makes rallying more intense and with the help of Mr. Co-Driver, I'm now always trying to read the stage a turn or two in advance. Helpful tips such as ''logs on the left'', help a lot.\n\nOverall, there is tons of potential in this new Dirt. I am geniuenly happy with my purchase, but bear in mind that I've always been a Codies racing game fan. With that said, compared to Dirt 3, I definitely think that this game is heading in the right direction. While at this point, the content is limited to 3 unique settings with multiple stages, and just rally cars from different eras, I expect greatness from Codemasters.\n\nP.S.

And it's only in Early Access!\n\nThe physics are great (nothing like DiRT 1, 2, or 3), and when racing through the incredibly detailed stages you feel like you're really there :)\n\nThe best way to describe the physics is 'sim'. Not arcady like the older DiRT games.\n\nOptimization is fantastic, I have been able to keep a mostly solid 60FPS at 1080p on my reasonably old GTX 770 and i5 4670, with the Ultra preset and 4x AA (considering it recommends a GTX 780, this was a great surprise for me). Using Nvidia's adaptive V-Sync I rarely notice the fps drops (worst I've had was 50 fps). You could easily run it 100% solid 60fps if you tweaked the settings a bit, but I couldn't be bothered.\n\nContent-wise, there is a good amount of cars and tracks, and every single track is beautifully modeled. As it's early access, there will be more content on it's way and not to mention the possibility of DLC once the game is finished.\n\nWorks great with my G25, and you can tweak all the FFB settings (like how much feedback you want from the tires, etc).\n\nGraphically it's beautiful, not much else I can say about that.\n\n\n\nIf you like rally games and sims, this game is for you.

I've never yelled so much at my computer =)\n\nI've got 600+ hours on Dirt3, but will probably never play it again now that this game is out.  This game is much harder to learn and control, but in a good way.  Much more realistic in both appearance and feel than dirt 3.  This game feels like a true rally/RX experience.\n\nBe aware before purchasing this game that it is much more down the simulation line than dirt 3.  If you're not up for a challenge learning to maneuver a vehicle on the edge of control, this might not be the game for you.  I would imagine it might be hard to play on the keyboard, though I haven't tried.  Works great with a gamepad or wheel.\n\n* Awesome physics.  Makes you feel like you're actually driving a rally car.\n* Much improved graphics.  The dusty stages I start to think I can't breath well and need a mask...\n* Better rally stages.  Not only is everything more realistic, from the scenery to the bumps, dips, rocks, potholes, etc. but they're also longer than the dirt 3 rally stages, which is great.\n* Overall just feels much more like a rally sim and less like NFS on dirt.  I loved dirt 3, but it was much more "arcade" style than this.\n\nYou may find yourself on the verge of rage-quitting on the icy section of monte carlo like me, only to find yourself unable to do so until you finally finish a clean run.... No other game has given me such a mix of frustration and addiction at the same time.\n\nReally the only thing I haven't been impressed with this game is the limited PvP community.  While there's a number of dedicated fans on at any given time, it's not the type of game you can hop on at any hour of the night and find online sessions available.

It's got the Dirt basics with respect to menus etc, but what's different about this game is you get a support team Who repair  your  vehicles. They also learn  to improve  your car through experience.  There's only  a few   rally tracks at the moment (Greece, Wales and Switzerland), but  more to come.\n\nThe game is also quite cheap for a AAA  racing game.\n\nThe sounds of the vehicle travelling over the roads and tracks, the crashes, the  sound of  gears changing and the engine revving etc, all are pretty convincing.  I'm hoping   they will add this to the Track IR (with 6 degrees of Freedom) and the Novint Falcon peripherals soon as the  ability to look around with the track IR  without using   any keys plus  the  force feedback you'd get with the Falcon would add another dimension to this game.\n\nI've never driven a rally car, but  this  makes me  feel like I am.\n\nOh yeah!  I forgot to mention, the more you crash, the more beat up your vehicle looks.     :)\n\n\nCheck the short  intro video HERE","April 27, 2015","true","7.3"," 48 of 57 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","48","57","0","4"

I WILL KEEP THIS SIMPLE...\n\nDO YOU LIKE ANY RALLY GAME EVER?\n\nDID YOU USED TO LIKE COLIN MCRAE RALLY ON PS1?\n\nIF SO THAN WHAT ON ODIN'S BEARD ARE YOU BLOODY WAITING FOR!?!?!?!\n\nThis game is exceptional... it really is... I was a huge fan of Dirt 3 but I was dissapointed in the small stages in Dirt 3... but guess what... LONG and SHORT stages as well as Pikes Peak's famous hillclimb tournaments...\n\nThe classes range from 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, kit cars, 1990s 2000's and modern as well as the infamous WRX v EVOs...\n\nNumerous countries such as Germany, Finland, Sweden, Greece, Wales and more...\n\nNumerous tournaments including online tournaments, you can create your own tournaments and put them online, leaderboards, daily, weekly and monthly challenges to earn more ingame $$$ (which you use to purchase cars, otherwise you must rent them),\n\nNO PAY TO WIN WHATSOEVER... completely in-game currency from completing tournaments....\n\nRealistic driving simulation and damage... be prepared, you can puncture your tyres in which it costs you +1:30 on your finish time, you can damage your radiator, you can even stack so hard that you forfeit the race and if your vehicle is beyond repair, costs you the WHOLE championship XD...\n\nCo-driver is fantastic... you can even speed up or slow down his instructions to your liking...\n\nThe replays are nothing short of spectacular... even has some awesome drone camera angles from the air...\n\nthe camera/view features 2x 3rd person, bonnet, inside windscreen, an awesome cockpit view and my all time favourite, that bumper view where you see no part of the vehicle whatsoever (I use this when in serious mode, as I drive the best in this view which I'm spewing coz I love seeing the car... Even when you create your own tournament, you can restrict the view to cockpit only!\n\nThis game is also open to steam workshop where you can upload your vehicle setups for whichever car, for other people to download... which comes in handy if you're anything like me and not interested into the nitty gritty of the art of mechanics and aerodynamics... I JUST WANNA RACE!!!!\n\nI have my game set to high with shadows and other non-essential extras set to medium and it looks absolutely gorgeous with excellent frames running off a GTX 680M (laptop)... the sound is brilliant really immersive... don't even think about TEAMSPEAK while playing this, even with ALL the audio set to it's lowest, you still won't hear your friends over the roaring and screaming of your engine...\n\nI cannot fault this game at all... and I'm being completely honest this game really impressed me, CODEMASTERS really put every ounce of love they had into this game, I feel sorry for their spouses...\n\nHOWEVER if I were to really try and look for a fault in this game, I'd say that there are idiots who cheat their way to the top of the leaderboards as I discovered that someone with only 24 hours experience defeated a person with 450 hours experience using the same car by almost a whole minute... and we all know in racing, 1 second is a lot of time! upon inspecting this guys profile, I noticed he has a current ban for cheating (surprise surprise) so I just reported him anyway...\n\nAnother thing I thought of... it doesn't have an Australian Rally, remember in Colin McRae those awesome as Aussie tracks with the train lines through the bush... well no Aussie tracks :'(\n\nLast but not least.... this game has held it's price tag, it goes on special quite often but not enough for people who aren't willing to give this game a go...\n\nMy verdict....\n\n10/10 it really is a modern gem, and one that comes out completed and without the over priced abuse of marketing technique for dlc\n\nThis game in my opinion is actually worth $60USDit has really impressed me, and i'm not evcen a car freak or one of those gamers with ONLY racing games... This is the ONLY racing game that I can spend more than an hour playing!\n\nTHANKYOU CODEMASTERS.... THANKYOU :')","April 15","true","27.8"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","34","36","5","6"

(As I often did)\n\nA simcade player's view on Dirt:RallyDisclaimer: This is a review written by nowhere-near-a-pro racer who does it purely for fun and intended for those who are similarly-minded. If any portion of the following causes you to want to type “git gud” in the comments, you're not the intended audience. There are plenty reviews detailing every simulation aspect elsewhere on this page.\n\nThat said, to my noobrethrenThis is the best type of simulator. Yes the current press releases and this very page boasts mostly about the reworked physics, the painstaking recreation of sufaces and handling, but the biggest thing for me is different, and that is that Dirt: Rally, seeking simulation glory, does not forget to be a fun game.\nI play games for relaxation and entertainment, and this game provides. It punishes mistakes, yes, but it doesn't do so unfairly, and unlike many other sims a small slip won't ruin your entire day.\nI was disappointed at first with the exclusion of Codies' famous flashback system, as it could give some breathing room to the tightest situations in other games, but the game without it is not as punishing as I thought it would be. If you get flung far off the track, you can reset with a time penalty. If you get seriously damaged, you can restart the stage — they are mostly not that long despite what it might have looked like with the "realism" goal. You lose some of the bonus for restarting, but that has been the case for flashbacks in previous games, so it's clear where it's coming from.\nThe handling system is not easy to master, but largely intuitive, and I've seen some improvements even by the second stage.\nWord of advice: Don't aim for first place at first. It is intentionally set to be a goal that's hard to achieve. Opponents are nicely spaced out, and in most cases even losing very very badly won't get you a last place.","April 27, 2015","true","194.3"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","35","38","0","2"

It's a proper rally simulation in Dirt series, something you did not expect. Runs exceptionally well on High and Mid-Low end systems. Great sounds, especially 5 cylinder Audi's. Very hard to master, but I'd suggest to turn off almost all asists, and leave the ones you can't live without, in my case - ABS, level 2.\nYou start your carrer with FWD Lancia or MINI. Pretty hard enough to control, top speed felt like already being the highest I could handle without kissing a tree. Finished second overall, bought an RWD BMW. Now I understood, that keyboard with RWD is just finger-bone-snapping experience, throttle control is absolute madness, sudden oversteer and everything else combined made my RWD journey very memorable, that's why I went straight to electronics shop. Still, nailed 3 stages with a pretty nice looking wreck. Gamepad is connected, I will end this now, cause I need to play some more.\n\nAs I already stated earlier, buy it.

Kudos.\nI am not saying that Gymkhana is crap, but knowing the fact that previous games were all about Colin McRae + rally, the last DiRT 3 basically ditched him. Sad. Instead, Ken Block took over unofficially. The situation with DiRT Rally is a little bit different.\n\nFirstly, at the time of writing this review, this game focuses mainly on rallying. There are couple of additions: rallycross and Pikes Peak hillclimb. Sadly, only rallycross is supported to play online with other fellow drivers. Multiplayer could mean that it's rallycross that will be mainly played.\nSecondly, nobody is the leader. This time Codemasters played it safe: not naming the "unofficial" leader.\nSweet graphics, but I still was expecting a little more than a revamped setup from DiRT 3.\nSpeaking of driving, I am satisfied by physics, they are OK. Since I am using a Logitech Driving Force GT, I enjoy this game quite alot. It's quite hard to get the proper settings for your steering wheel. And that is the only thing that I dislike about this game.\n\n9/10.\n\nCodemasters - I really hope that in near future this game will outgrow the WRC series by Milestone (or whatever company that made it).

Dirt Rally is aimed at the hardcore rally fans and has a steep learning curve to truly master the game, however also offers difficulty levels challenging enough for new players and veterans of the game. You need a racing wheel or controller if you want to play the game at a serious level. The game offers a lot of replayability and is great value for money in my opinion.\n\nThe game is visually stunning and offers a wide variety of game modes. You can play through a career mode, race in online multiplayer or set up leagues and compete against your friends best times. There are 6 different rally locations with 12 stages on each, as well as various Pikes Peaks routes and rally cross events. There's plenty of cars to choose from and the game isn't related to previous "dirt" games other than in the name, so you can pick and choose what cars and stages you want to race without being forced into any unwanted races.","December 23, 2015","true","209.2"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","28","32","2","0"

The successor to Richard Burns Rally!\n\nThe first and the most important of all: it's a SIM, not an arcade game. Don't be disappointed if you crash in your first corner, just keep trying, it's HARD at first try. But that feeling, when you achieve some results - absolutely brilliant, incredible and rewarding! Everything is perfect about this game, and nope, I'm not biased. It's that great! And it will get even better! Don't ignore the game just because it's Early Access (in this case, Codies use this Steam feature to their advantages, really!). It's the rally simulation we (rally fans / sim players) all waited for a long time.\nThe tracks are completely stunning, built with so much detail, creativity and attention - the whole environment is alive while you are rushing towards the finish line, either on gravel, tarmac, ice or snow. You have a really intensive and real connection to the surface, that's why I recommend playing it with a better wheel which has Force Feedback. The cars sound great, like nowhere else in a rally simulator. The Steam Workshop support is a nice addition, as you can get some controller settings and great car setups for specific tracks from other players, if you want to improve your stage times. The v1.10 update added some great tutorials for beginners, for those who aren't familiar with rally racing or even racing in general. I find those videos a great addition to the package.\nThe tracks are in Wales, Greece, Monaco, Germany, Finland, Sweden, USA (Hillclimb), Norway (Rallycross), England (Rallycross), Sweden (Rallycross), and they are all real-world tracks (if you don't believe me, check out my guide at the bottom of my review)!\nThe only thing I can say as a negative is that it doesn't have a multiplayer mode for rally, with staggered starts, but I hope we can get it somehow, sometimes.\n\nThe way they handle community feedback is absolutely brilliant. DiRT Rally's Early Access period was it's best period, and the best EA I've ever seen. During the progress we went through the simulator evolved and got better based on feedback. Kudos to Codemasters, they are going in a really, really great way. Colin McRae would be proud! :-)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=470160373","June 21, 2015","true","142.0"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","21","21","0","6"

Driving at night in the rain is probably the most realism I have felt from a racing game.  There's also a career mode where you can upgrade your car.  It's perfect in my books.  Plus we don't have to wait to play it!  It feels like a finished product, perfectly optimized on the absolute highest settings it will go I'm getting like 70-100+ FPS easily without any issues with a really old processor.  Insanely well optimized.\n\nFlaw?  Career mode needs a bit of a tweak.  You can't really redo races, and there's only one state of progression, no going back, you lose your cash you're out of luck.  Can't really make any mistakes at all during your entire progress through the game with the exception of resetting each time during a race to the start.  I was just trying it out and after my first little set of races I did horribly because I crashed my car basically, and got a DNF for that race.  So basically a horrible fail and I lost more money than I earned.  It was the first race so I just wanted to start over but you can't.  There's an option to reset your game which I did, and it resets everything including your games' stats.  Sort of sucks, considering if you were playing a career mode for a long time and you made a few mistakes down the road (fall off the track?) and don't have time to finish restarting, you would have to basically reset your entire game save including everything you've ever done.  Much different than Dirt 3 where you can basically redo those tour races over and over until you got perfect on each one.  You never had the risk of losing it all because you had a friend come over and had to exit the game and lose your whole career mode lol.  I left suggestions on the developer's feedback forum, I hope they can realize this oversight.\n\nAnyways, having played the game for a few days, I no longer see this as a big drawback (not that it really was in the first place), but you just have to play this game differently.  You have to seriously do well on your championship races or don't even do them, but since you can endlessly restart you can keep redoing them until you get a not-horrible-run and then continue to the next race, you'll always come out at a profit and if you are really good and you can complete all of the races without restarting the game rewards you for that.\n\nMy favorite part of the game are the online races.  Not interactively online but challenges that we get to do every day, week, and there is also a monthly event.  This basically ensures the game will always be somewhat fresh.  In the challenge, you can't reset the round, you have one shot to complete it and if you fall too far off the track you could end a 24-race monthly challenge in an instant and never be able to attempt it until the next month.  It's refreshingly difficult and you have to really pay attention, but you don't have to really sweat it because you can practise as much as you like arcade mode.  Pretty cool game.\n\nI'd like to see the vehicle upgrading enhanced a little bit.  You don't have direct control over it, you hire crew and the crew automatically does upgrades for you.  It's pretty weird but I guess they thought it was a good idea, I'd rather have to save up money and have to buy individual parts or at least have a level 1-5 on each part and buy upgrades for them.  Their system might work out okay, better than nothing, but the repair system in between races should be tweaked a bit.  If you have 85% wheel condition you can repair it up to 90% condition?  It should be more specific in which parts are getting fixed, and let you choose.  Maybe not super specific but for example your headlights, that's bundled in with 'body', you might want to put a lot of repairs into the body/headlights because your upcoming race is night time and it's pretty much impossible without lights and if you have 60% body condition and repair it to 70%, are your lights even going to be fixed?  If not, that was a waste of your repair time, but I'd much rather the game let me pick exactly what needs to be fixed.  You might have 1 wheel missing at the end of a race, it would be nice to just have that wheel and maybe your headlights fixed, seems pretty reasonable for a game this hardcore with it's permadeath 24 race rally runs, they should at least grant you a bit more control over it.\n\nAll in all, a helluva time, 10/10, so great that we get to play the game as they are developing it.","April 27, 2015","true","21.8"," 36 of 48 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","36","48","2","20"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GTOfire/recommended/310560/","GTOfire","GTOfire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GTOfire/","83 products in account","A big thumbs up. The driving to me feels worthy to be called an RBR successor, and it's definitely that type of sim-realism that they've gone for with this game. The roads are narrow, the cliffs are steep, the cars are fast and when the co-driver says "don't cut", you'd better do as he says.\n\nDownsides include:\n* No content modding support at the time of writing (just after launch), nor do we know yet if they plan to make new content themselves\n* Cars are in ample supply, though some classics are omitted for licensing reasons I assume. No Toyota Corolla for example.\n* Locations are varied, but don't amount to a great deal of drivable road. Each event (6 now) contains 2 long stages, and these stages are in various configurations for a full rally, by cutting them in 2 and doing them again and then the reverse of all of those. I certainly enjoy the reverse stages as much as the forward, but driving the exact same stage twice in the same direction can get tedious if an event gives you A reverse, then A, then AB, then B, and then B reverse all in a row.\n* No rally school or playground to mess around in, though you can always just load up any stage on any event in any car in custom event mode.\n* The co-driver is very important, and you learn to trust him over time. But at the same time there are 1 or 2 turns per location where he calls a turn much wider than it is and you wish you could punch him in the face for it. It's not often so you eventually learn that a particular turn is coming and what it really is, but there's no pacenote editor right now to fix it properly.\n\nAll in all, yes I've mentioned a bunch of negatives, but overall the postives vastly outweigh them. Even as a newcomer you'll learn the tricks quickly enough to progress through the cars and after 57 hours of driving the stages in various configurations I can't say I'm tired of driving them yet. Even if they deliver no additional content down the line through free or paid DLC, and even if they don't support modders doing it for them, the game is fully worth the price of admission for what it currently offers. And if you end up being 'done' with this game after 100 hours and want to go back to RBR mods, that was 100 hours very well spent.","December 29, 2015","true","58.5"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","23","26","2","1"

Those fireworks, Hollywood style, the gymkhana. That day i felt like something died inside me. Then DiRT3 came, and wasn't much better, let's face it. And here I was, 5 hours ago still feeling something dead inside, wishing for a decent old school rally game...\n\nBut I have to wish no more. Out of the blue this game came out and hands down, so far looks and feels awesome. Could be one of the best rally games ever without a doubt. No more fireworks, no more Hollywood bs. Only mud, dirt and nothing but rally.\n\nGraphics\nGame looks fantastic. There's a few things that Codemasters should improve like the spectators. They kinda look ugly for a 2015 game. And there's a few visual bugs related to shadows but nothing too severe. Interiors are BEAUTIFUL, full of details and speaking about details, the game is full of them inside and outside the vehicles. The mud, the burning brakes at night...\n\nSound\nAgain, fantastic job. Cars sound incredible, specially the group B. You can even hear the window rattle. Soundtrack is nice, nothing too fancy but does the job.\n\nGameplay\nNow, this is where the game proves that is not a DiRT4. Rally is closer to simulation than ever before. There's a few options to make the experience a lil close to arcade (ABS, TCS, stuff like that) but if you turn them all off the game feels pretty realistic. I can't say how close is to RBR but one thing is certain, this is completely different to DiRT or even CM.\n\nAnd they added a few features, like upgrades for the cars (Nothing too powerful to make that Mini the ultimate rally car) and staff management, where you choose the team, pay their salaries, fire them and ofc each one has different stats that affect for example, the amount of damage they can repair between stages.\n\nOverall\nI have to recommend this. It's been too long since we had an old school rally game. And so far looks promising, there's a few things they have to fix, content to add (Included hill climb. they have confirmed Pikes peak) and many cars to come before release. So far it includes 17 cars and 36 stages (You can set the hour, included night) so there's plenty to play around till the next update.\n\nIt is kinda awkward to say this, but... Thank you Codemasters.\n\nAnd remember, "Being fast is about skill, not raw speed". Otherwise this happens...\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=433408088","April 27, 2015","true","70.3"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","1"

There is no Gymkhana here. It is just pure rally racing, and it is not as forgiving as previous versions of DiRT. This is much more of a sim racing game than recent DiRT games, and moreso than the WRC games too.\n\nI have been playing the game with an Xbox 360 controller, and with no assists on it is challenging to stay on the course. You have to watch your speed as you approach turns, make sure you enter and exit the turns without drastic changes in throttle and steering, or else you will end up in a tree. At least you can reset your car onto the course if you do crash, but you will take a time penalty and your car may be damaged. I imagine the game would be even more fun with a wheel and pedals.\n\nThe courses are narrow and stages are longer than in DiRT 3. Damage is in the game (cannot be turned off) and it will effect your car. I had a right front puncture in the middle of a stage and had to finish the stage with the car pulling to the right the whole time. That was nerve wracking but realistic. One time I went off so fast my car was totaled, forcing me to retire from the event.\n\nAll the typical camera angles are here, from a follow view, bumper cam, hood cam, dashboard cam, and the traditional cockpit cam. There are a lot of graphical settings to adjust to your computer's abilities. Buttons can be remapped too, which may seem like a minor thing but some games (The Crew) have left this option out.\n\nThere are some shortcomings to DiRT Rally as it stands right now. I cannot hear the pace notes and I'm not sure why. I tried various settings but they just do not play for me. Hopefully this will be tracked down and fixed soon because driving blind (there is no course minimap) is tricky. The selection of locations and cars is a bit sparse for now, but this is early access and more are coming. One other feature I would like to see is the ability to adjust sensitivity for the controller, to fit different tastes. I would like the option to turn it down slightly.\n\nOverall this is a good racing game for early access. There already is a lot of polish to the game and it has promise. This is not your typical DiRT game meant to be blasted through without practice. With patience it can be an enjoyable experience.","April 28, 2015","true","13.6"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

More challenging than it's predecessors, the learning curve is steep but rewarding. I've played the first two full events available, and I could NOT pause the game, itch my face, or check my phone. This is adrenaline pumping sim rally car driving in the best way.\n\nWow. Having played Dirt 2, Dirt 3, and Showdown, each with a X360 controller, and Logitech G21 wheel/pedals, I've been loving the Dirt series for quite some time, in various ways.\n\nDirt 2 was a dream. Yes, there were various events that I didn't like as much as others, but having completed the game various times, it is definitely enjoyable. Dirt 2 had long rally races unlike other racing games I had played prior. I grew up trail riding on dirt bikes while camping, and nothing had ever come close to creating this feeling of adventure and adrenaline. Since the release date, I've enjoyed Dirt 2 with all setups at my disposal, oddly my favorite of which was the X360 controller (a slight blend of sim and arcade), but getting the game to work with my Oculus DK2 and the G21 was incredible. Although I still haven't managed to get the DK2 to provide head tracking, so I suppose it's more like your head is bolted looked straight the whole time. Ah well.\n\nDirt 3 had some more recognizable rally events (with relation to this game, heavily wooded tight tracks), yet an abundance of new and less enjoyable event types. With the graphical improvement of 3, it was hard to resist playing, but I, sadly, never completed the game given the various other event types. (I'm looking at you gymkhana!) This game was better suited for my G21, but ultimately the tracks just weren't... right with me. Perhaps it was the slightly heavier sim element, but with event types that were arcade feeling that put me off, I also missed the Dirt 2 desert trail feeling.\n\nShowdown, I played very slightly.\n\nDirt Rally is a very humble new beginning for the Dirt Series (ditching the numbers, aside to Showdown) which focuses on my favorite aspect of the game. Although in it's current form it does not include my favorite vibe of track (desert trailblazer style), the aesthetic, customization options, sim options, X360 compatibility, and all around feeling of the game are present in the best way yet. The graphics are fantastic (running at 70FPS average on Ultra) and FEELS like trail-riding, although trapped in a car. I would ask Codemasters to include dirt bikes if possible, but they have the perfect formula for off road rally cars. Oh, and lastly, Codemasters, please add paved parts of maps. The feeling of getting off the vibration centric dirt roads of Dirt 2 onto pavement in a 350+HP car and hauling a** for a minute was incredible.","April 30, 2015","true","2.7"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"

Coming from simulators such as iRacing and Assetto Corsa, I would say DiRT Rally is in the same league.\n\nI have some experience with Richard Burns Rally which is touted as being the best driving simulation available, which I would absolutely agree with. It's hard for me to compare the two as I haven't played RBR in a while, however, I remember RBR just feeling right when I first tried it. DiRT Rally also gave me this feeling so they must be doing something right. Considering RBR was released 10 years ago, it's about time somebody challenged to be the king of driving simulation.\n\nThe handling is raw and unforgiving. The sounds, especially in third person, are perfect. The graphics are good enough; which I don't mind as long as the handling feels good.\n\nSteering wheel support seems OK. using a G27, I set the degrees of rotation to 270 in logitech profiler and turned the wheel strength down to 80%, wheel weight to 40%. There doesn't seem to be any clutch support which is odd. I'm using elastic bands to convert my H-shifter into a sequential shifter. A handbrake is definitely a requirement now. In the next few days I'll be designing a 3d printable off/on handbrake which will use an Arduino Pro Micro as the USB device controller. Unfortunately I don't think a handbrake axis is supported.\n\nThe pace notes let the game down at the moment. I'm forever shouting at my virtual co-driver when he calls a turn too late and I go flying off a cliff. To add to this, I don't like the graphical pacenotes overlay. It's very hard to distinguish what's coming up next at a glance if you didn't hear the co-driver say it (I know you wouldn't get this benefit IRL but it's poorly executed). I also think the pacenote graphics look childish and overly stylised which isn't in keeping with the clean and serious UI/attitude of the game.\n\nThe in-game cameras are another slight let down. For the time being I'm forced to use the dash cam because the cockpit cam is too far back. I'd also like a bit more flexibility in the replays to watch on the TV style cams all the time. I understand why they've done it this way but it's a game, the devs have the ability to use any cameras they want.\n\nAnother thing that annoys me is the vehicle recovery mechanic. Sometimes I'm not given a chance to recover the vehicle myself and I'm magically dumped back on the track with a time penalty. Something Richard Burns Rally did well was a quick animation showing spectators flipping the car back over for you. It just adds a bit of immersion rather than a magical lazy recovery to the middle of the track.\n\nI'm not too fond of the progression aspect of the championship. I'd prefer to test my skills as a driver rather than my patience. Having said that, the mini was pretty fun.\n\nAll things considered I'd definitely recommend this game. With a bit more work and more content I can see it being really great. Thank you to codemasters for taking a step back and assessing the market. I've had enough of the assist ridden Monster Energy adverts you've been putting out over the past few years.","April 29, 2015","true","22.0"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","2"

They decided to go down the early access route and I can tell you from a day 1 player, this has gone from strength to strength and by far the best early access game I have put my time into and also rally sim game. This area has been barren for a number of years since Richard Burns Rally came out and to imagine that people are still playing and modding that game showed there was still a desire for these games out there.\n\nIf you are expecting a DiRT 3 sequel, be wary. This game is HARD. You have to actually practice proper rally techniques rather than the usual arcade brake, turn and accelerate. You do that in this game and either you will oversteer or understeer off the road. This game doesn't forgive. Even after my 110 hours in the game (possibly the most in any racing game to date) I still manage to crash either based on my split second ignoring my co driver or an error in speed.\n\nBut that is the beauty of this game and that is why I have so many hours in it. It makes you want to improve. Don't expect to be topping leaderboards in the championship mode, hell even coming 5th when you start is a godsend. You have to upgrade your car and your driving skills. Slower is generally quicker I have discovered. Floor the throttle and you will find yourself in a smooth embrace with a tree.\n\nIf you are into PVP, they have also signed a deal with the FIA World Rallycross Championhip which brings some well known tracks and a number of the current cars from the IRL championship including Petter Solberg's DS3 and the Fiesta. This is a great experience so long as you get some people who are willing to play fair but that is the same in all pvp.\n\nTLDR Section!\n\nPros-\n\n- Great driving physics\n- Wide range of cars and tracks\n- Daily, weekly and monthly events for chances to earn extra cash competing against all other players on the leaderboard\n- Steep learning curve (this is if you love a challenge and improving, if not look down)\n\nCons-\n\n- Steep learning curve, part 2 (this is not a game for the casual racer. It will take practice and time to get good and find the enjoyment in it\n- While there are a number of different tracks, you will find some of the longer tracks cut in half to count as some extra stages rather than every stage be the same. Personally doesn't bother me though.\n- Damage engine isn't very advanced I think due to a dated engine. I imagine if they knew how popular this would get they would have started from scratch.\n\nI throughly recommend this game and can't wait until the Oculus Rift consumer version releases so I can get fully 'into it'!","December 7, 2015","true","207.5"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","2"

Not only does it introduce more rally cars - and even one new class of cars - but also a bunch of long-awaited features and an overhaul of the Group B (4WD) and Group A physics.\nSo far I spent the majority of my playtime since the release of this update using the Peugeot 205 T16 Evo 2. Since I already had spent a fair bit of time with this car previously, the difference was very noticeable: The car is more nervous now, but also very nimble and has a lot less grip than before. These changes also serve to make it feel even more powerful because it has become harder to tame the beast. But when you do it's an absolute blast. The FFB, while feeling a little lighter compared to other cars, does convey everything you need to know about the state of the car and the road surface. Every car does feel different in DR, and the FFB combined with the v2 physics - as far as implemented - further improve upon this.\n\nOriginal review\n\nIt's hot, and the glaring light of the midday sun hurts my eyes. I depress the clutch and put the car into first gear. One more glance to my co-driver - he's absolutely focused on the task ahead. My right foot hits the gas pedal and the mid-mounted 4-cylinder turbo- and supercharged engine screams in reply. A cold shiver runs down my spine. "A thrill ride through beautiful Greece, in a Lancia Delta S4 - a car that generates 400 bhp at less than 900 kilograms weight - what could possibly go wrong?"\n\nA lot, as it would later turn out. The "GO!" signal echoes through my head; I drop the clutch and the bullet I'm sitting in shoots forward, screaming, waving its rear and sending large amounts of gravel to the sides.\n\nThe first bends dart towards me at unreal speed. After passing through the first of them without an incident, I fall into a trance; a blur of steering, shifting and listening to my co-driver, who spits out his pacenotes as precisely as a machine.\n\nEverything goes well for about 3 or 4 kilometers. Then it happens: I miscalculate the trajectory through a rather unremarkable turn. My mistake sends the car flying down a slope, all four wheels losing contact. It's nothing short of a miracle we don't hit one of the nearby trees. The question is this: Do we call for help and risk losing time or do we push ahead, hoping to get to higher ground again? I opt for the latter, and through what seems like another miracle make it back to the track without damaging the car or losing too much time.\n\nNo more events in the next sector, but then tragedy happens. I lose control over the car for a brief moment, and my efforts to correct the mistake are in vain, thanks to the loose surface beneath the car. It slides forward and sideways, and I prepare for the worst. But all I feel is a slight bump. However, the hissing sound from the left means that at least one of the car's tires were damaged but I can't tell if it's the front or rear. "Oh great, this is going to be fun", I think to myself.\n\nI back up and accelerate again, then try to assess the damage. We can continue, sure enough, but for how long? The car, previously a nimble and fast race horse, starts to transform into something else. The reactions are getting slower and less precise, and I do not know how much longer the tire will hold.\n\nAbout 1.5 kilometers later I'm getting my answer: With a loud bang the tire, or what was left of it, disintegrates. The scraping noise from the back of the car doesn't exactly inspire confidence, and the first few meters confirm my worst fears. The race horse I once rode has turned into a murderous three-legged bull intent on killing me and my co-driver.\n\nGoing full speed as I was before was out of the question now. We surely wouldn't make the top places, but hell if I let some blown tire end our rally prematurely! Carefully directing this out-of-control cruise missile through every bend on our way, I find it harder and harder to keep it on the road. Each steering input I make is answered by an opposing reaction, randomly changing our course to everywhere but the road ahead.\n\nEvery little bump turns into a deathtrap, every corner into pure madness. What remains of the stage ahead of us becomes an odyssey, but then I finally see the pre-finish markers and my heart skips a beat in relief. It is only then I realize the gaping abyss to the right of the road. Relief turns to terror as I lose control of the car once more, but I quickly regain it before getting too close to the edge. I accelerate the car - still veering left and right - and shift into third and then fourth gear, before finally crossing the finishing line with a smile on my face.\n\nThese were the scariest 8 minutes of my life, but also among the most fulfilling. As I look at the leaderboard I prepare to find myself way down... But I'm shocked to find myself close to the better entries, just barely missing an entry in the top tier of this event. Guess not everyone was as lucky as getting away with a blown tire.\n\n\nPreliminary Review\n\nIs this game worth getting?\n\nYes.\n\nHere are the "buts": The game is still in Early Access; there is a decent amount of content, but many stages have overlapping sectors. On the other hand the locations differ greatly in terms of look and feel, especially when it comes to the actual surface. There are 5 different rally locations overall: Greece, Wales, Monte Carlo, Germany and Finland. At least one more location is to be released soon, so far only known as "Winter Wonderland".\n\nThe core of any simulation that ultimately decides if it fails or prevails is the magic that happens between the tires and the road - the physics. Don't be fooled by looking at Codemaster's racing and rally games from the more recent years; make no mistake, THIS IS A SIMULATION. If you absolutely must compare it to Richard Burns Rally (and if you're into racing simulations, chances are you will), Dirt Rally feels *slightly* more 'forgiving' overall; however, to be quite honest I would partially blame this on some issues with RBR itself rather than only DR. No matter how you look at it, Dirt Rally is *not* an arcade game (but it does offer some driving aids on which I can't personally comment since I haven't used any of them).\n\nUltimately, the one issue that is bothering me until now is the spread out content. This game is titled Dirty *Rally*. Having Hillclimb and Rallycross Events (even the official WRX license!) is (somewhat) nice to have, but there isn't that much diversity when it comes to content for these modes. There are basically two RX locations and one (and a half) hillclimb locations. The car selection for these modes is okay, though nothing to brag about IMHO (hillclimb, I'm looking at you!).\nThe issue I have with this is that there currently isn't enough content for these modes to make them enjoyable for extended periods of time. And let's not forget that developing these things and putting them into the game actually takes development resources *away* from the core of the game - rally.\nSo my hope is that we will see a long-time support from CM for Dirt Rally, adding more content to the game (preferably as free updates, IF possible) or officially supporting the modding scene. However, given the current state of things the later isn't very likely so my guess is we'll see some paid DLC sometime after the 1.0 release of the game.\n\nSummary\nWe've been waiting for a new king of rally sims for too long, and Dirt Rally looks like it's going to be it. Definitely worth getting even in EA, as long as you don't mind a few (minor) issues and hoping for a little more content. It's good already and it's only going to get better!","May 25, 2015","true","54.7"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","4"

I've played over 300 hrs on this game which speaks volumns on how good this is. I've played this more than any other racing game. Why? Its so realistic. I actually feel I'm driving a real car.  The graphics and Physics are spot on. The Forcefeedback on a steering wheel is spot on.  All of the Rally stages are perfect offering a wide range of surfaces. PLus with Rally cross and the Hill climb race makes it a true all rounder. Something for everyone.  You never get bored as with the daily, weekly and monthly events it always gives you something to come back to each week. PLus with the PVP online gaming events which you play with fellow drivers on the Rally cross is spot on and offers a diferent aspect to this Rally Sim.  I've had this game from almost day one in the early access stage and have just seen this grow from strength to strength. Yes it had its ups and downs but with the Codies working very cloisely to the community we worked around all the niggles that occurred.  Is it worth buying? Yes sir it is one to have in your collection. It is hard to master and I recommend always to take your time and just aim to finish a stage.  This isnt your usual arcade racer where you are guaranteed to win every stage. This one makes you work for it.  I'm still only managing to reach 7th or 8th place in the masters league and I've played over 300 hrs.  But I keep coming back because of the challenges it presents me and for the realism. Theres nothing else out there like it in the modern age of rally sims.","December 14, 2015","true","425.3"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tommyk154/recommended/310560/","tommyk154","TommyK154","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tommyk154/","48 products in account","As someone who got this game almost day 1 of Early Alpha, I keep coming back to try and update my review. I loved this game in its early stages but its now a full release and it's just not that good. It definitely has the best fanboys though, as all the objective and critical reviews and buried deep underneath piles of "this game is so hard I rolled on the first corner so obviously its super realistic" nonsense. And I'm sure many will dismiss this as me being bad at the game (despite being on the top 5% of leaderboards) or that I just don't get it (despite having played this entire series since McRae 2.0 all the way through to DiRT3, and various simracers like Assetto), but here is an actual critical review instead of making jokes about cars rolling over.\n\nThe BadJust on content alone, my decision would be "No". The price you pay for what you get is pretty terrible. All things considered, there's really not that much more content than there was in alpha (at the time of review). There's only 5 rally locations and there's only like 3/4 long tracks in each location, which then get broken down into smaller segments to create an illusion that theres more content then there actually is. There's also a lack of cars. The diversity(60s, Group B, Group A, etc) is pretty good, but the choices within these groups is terrible. Most only have 2 or 3 cars to choose from. The new Seb Rally EVO and WRC games put Dirt Rally to absolute shame in this regard. On paper you might look and say "but there's also Hillclimb and Rallycross", and I'll reply with those are so underdeveloped it's even less than an afterthought. The content/price is just not there.\n\nNow onto the meat of the game. First off lets get this out of the way, not having rewinds is a stupid idea. There is no discussion about this. The fanboys will try to tell you til they are bleeding out of their mouths that this makes the game "more realistic" but guess what, you don't have to use them if you don't want to. Not having rewinds is literally a waste of life as the game screws you over with its terrible tire puncture model(more on that later) or with its terrible track edges which defy any and all physics and send 1000kg cars flying 2-stories into the air upon the slightest contact, which I assume is to prevent exessive cutting, but screws over people who just got off track a bit. The track edges have been a well documented issue which was mostly "fixed" in the later Sweden and Finland stages, but still exist in all the other tracks.\n\nBut that's a liveable annoyance compared to the balloon, I mean tire, model. Which again, wouldn't be that bad if you could just rewind instead of a) restarting completely or b) taking a 1:30 penalty for something that in some cases isn't even your fault (and that's the part that really upsets me). Smashing into something with the side of your car will lead to a puncture 100% of the time regardless of how slow the impact was, which can usually be understandable. Where the BS comes in is in situation where damage to the front of the car results in a rear puncture or vice versa. I've rolled the car onto its roof before and I kid you not, as I did so my co-driver called out a puncture. Its this kind of unrelated damage leading to a puncture that will drive you mad. But STILL, that's nowhere near as bad as the Finland Phenomenon where you get punctures for no reason. You can stay on the track 100% of the time and still get punctures out of nowhere. And again this wouldn't be that big of an issue if I could just rewind the BS punctures back, but you can't. Not having rewind is NOT a feature. It just wastes so much of your actual life.\n\nAnd yet ANOTHER bad feature that could be ignored if they simply added rewind: the pacenotes are terrible. Not everywhere but in enough places on enough stages to throw you off. This game makes terrible use of the "plus" and "minus" modifiers and considers some turns to be "straight" enough not to even warrant a "6" whereas on other stages turns much straighter will be marked as a "6", leading to confusion on how bad the turn actually is. There is no way to change this. Likewise the timings are inconsistent. Some stages you'll be going along wondering why a turn was called so early or furious that one was called way too late. And theres no way to change it (you can set calls to early/normal/late but that applies to ALL of them, not just the ones you want to change). This is another case where a simple rewind (see the theme here?), now knowing that the turn is tighter/wider or earlier/later, would basically turn this into a non-issue.\n\nThe only thing that a rewind couldn't solve is the UI. Terrible design. Takes 11 button presses to do things that should only take 2. Still a waste of real life, but a minimal complaint compared to everything else.\n\nFFB seems to be a pretty subjective topic, but I personally find it not great and inconsistent. Maybe if you want to spend 5hrs digging around in settings you can make something good, but I believe it should work decently out of the box, which it doesn't (at least with default setttings on the G27). Again, subjective and there is a lot of customization available, but this might be the worst default FFB out of all the games I've played.\n\nThe career mode is a joke, to the point where I've had this game since alpha launch and it took me this long to remember it exists. Its just premade events (like the custom single events you can play) strung along one after the other to make up a "season". You can hire different engineers which are better at fixing certain parts as if it actually makes a difference (spoiler alert: it doesn't) and you can unlock skills for them which don't affect repair time or skill or anything actually useful, just how fast you unlock "upgrades" for your car. The upgrades are another joke, each car has 3 and I dont even know what they are because that's how generic the upgrade system is. They also don't make any noticible difference after being added onto your car. Zero/minimal effort was put into this.\n\nThe GoodI don't need to go into this too much since the good reviews are the only ones getting upvoted. But as other people say, graphics are good, probably the best of all rally game out there. I've had very few stutter and pop-in issues with an Nvidia card on max graphics, very rare but they exist. Sound is also probably the best you'll get from the current selection of rally games. For the most part its an immersive experience all around. Pretty good and fairly dense crowds, although definitely should be more dense in some parts (going off of real life footage) and its a shame they don't try to get out of your way. Even if you're trying to turn your car around at <5mph after a spin or something, the crowd won't move and its instant +15sec penalty upon contact. But great in-game and replay camera angles really add to the immersion. The in-car camera also has a bunch of customization movement-wise (up/down, forward/back, etc). The co-driver is a bit quiet and there is no audio slider to change this, but he does speak clearly at least.\n\nI'll give it credit for taking a franchise which completely lost its way and attempting to get it back on track. Because that's really why this game exists. Its basically a giant beta for Dirt Rally 2, which is how the devs have been treating it if you follow their diaries the youtube channel. I'm glad this game exists and the racing community is better because it does, but this is far from the ultimate rally game. It is however, a promising step forward and for the future of this franchise. Online leagues are the only thing that keep me coming back, if it wasn't for the bragging rights of beating other people I'd really have no interest left unless some new content or drastic changes were added.","March 7","false","84.6"," 92 of 153 people (60%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","60","92","153","7","6"

That said, I feel it absolutely necessary to chime in on what may possibly be the most ENJOYABLE racing experience i've ever had.  Im 31 and have played just about every single racing game ever made and past favorites include somewhat niche titles such as Project Gotham(Previous favorite) to the hardcore more popular titles such as Forza and Gran turismo.\n\nIn a very simple sense, this is like Project Gotham Rally. Initially simple but near limitness challenge and opportunity for improvement.  A somewhat perfect balance of sim and arcade.  Its just ENJOYABLE.  I enjoy ever single race with the exception of most of the RWD cars(Yes I suck with them).  Some may claim it was designed as a pure sim but many elements such as the damage, wonky airtime antics, post jump landings, etc dont seem 100% authentic but its pretty obvious the game wouldnt be very enjoyable if you clipped a stone on your second turn and ripped the back half of your car off spreading parts all over the road essentially killing your run.  The game is certainly brutal enough and you can total your vehicle forcing a restart but you really have to beat the cars into the ground for them to become totalled as opposed to real life where something as simple as a small jump can reek havic on the car.  Jumps just feel way too smooth and I wish the cars "bucked" a bit more as they landed depending on your trajectory but its all good, its keeps the momentum going and the experience fast and frantic without constant unpredictable wipeouts.\n\nOne final comment I want to make is something that stands out to me in nearly every race.  The game does a FANTASTIC job simulating speed.  Something I think every racing developer tries to nail but almost always doesnt.  If my memory serves me correct this was my main issue with Forza and just circuit racing games in general.  Maybe it just has something to do with driving on wide open roads as opposed the narrow, natural, paths you will be driving on in a rally game.  Even on some of the games larger straight aways, Germany and Finland are my favs, you just get an immense sense of speed as your car runs through each gear nearly topping out before having to slam on the breaks full force at the end to nail that acute turn.  But even this, which is normally cause for disaster in most other games, just works better.  You can be barelling down, see your impending turn and slam on the breaks and actually stop.  Its amazing, no more you didnt break at just the right freaking time so now your gonna fly off into the sand pit.  I honestly dont think I will ever go back to traditional racing after this.\n\nDiRT Rally has spoiled me in all the right ways and I have zero desire to play or try any other racing game in the forseeable future.  In the end, the game just puts a big smile on my face!  Something I have been longing for in a racing game for a long, long time.\n\nIf you even like racing games, do yourself a favor and just buy it.

Gone is the arcade feel of the previous games; DiRT Rally offers complex handling and modeling, making vehicle choice and pre-race setup a major consideration that will affect every aspect of an upcoming event.  Graphics and sound are extremely well-realized, making shakedowns and races a deeply absorbing experience.\n\nWhile DiRT Rally has only been released into Early Access for a few days, it's already remarkable well-developed and refined, offering intense racing experiences in a variety of challenging locations.  The game is slated to be in Early Access development for the next 6-7 months, and it will only increase in depth and quality during that time.  Highly recommended for all racing simulation enthusiasts and rally fans!","May 2, 2015","true","6.7"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

Buy it. Not only do i recommend this Game but also i suggest buying a decent steering wheel.\nI just made my own raceseat and fittet it with a G27 Wheel and it's amazing. Racing for 3 hours and i am physically exhausted.\n\nIf you love Rally / Rally-Games AND you can race a car without constant full throttle you will get your moneys worth here.\nThis means, as this game (at least imo) counts as a simulation, you have to treat it like one. If you get off the track hard, you fail the stage, or at least get a recovery penalty so big, you consider the run failed just aswell.\n\nYou will restart your races a lot in the beginning and i even suggest this so you can learn the game/cars. Later on, when you did, you shouldn't need to restart. Just accept the outcome.\n\nI really recomend a steering wheel of some sort or at least a controller with feathering triggers (like the xbox pad).\n\nPS: Ditches love cars.

Focused on pure point to point racing. No more Gymkhana.\n\nAfter getting used to the physics in this game, going back to older DiRT games feel like arcade folly. There are 3 basic modes Rally, Hill-climb and recently the added Rally X Cross (which is the only mode wherein other cars share the road with you.)\n\nUpdates are frequent with new cars and tracks. Each track being a location with very specific road conditions and each rally being different sections of that track including the mirror versions of those different sections. Tarmac, snow/ice, loose gravel of varying sizes which all give a different feel when driving. Mud behaves differently than dry dirt as does the vehicle depending on your drivetrain. It'll make you want to buy a wheel if you didn't have one already.\n\nLots of assists and bonus credits for turning them off. For easy entry into the series but still very difficult to master. There are no more flashbacks making racing much more intense. In its stead is a time penalty of resetting your car back onto the track. A nice trade off is you can avoid this penalty by getting back onto the track yourself before the timer deems you unable to get back.\n\nBy far the most realistic entry into the series, I'd even extend that to all rally/off-road racing games; Graphically and more importantly the physics therein. Cars receive damage and even retain that damage through the races and must be repaired in between with possible time penalties for 'over repairing' beyond your given time to repair.\n\nYou will build a team, crew chief and other members. That get better and more efficient the more they work with you. Make sure you keep their contract up as these people you hire will allow you to fix more things in between races and keep your vehicle in tip top shape even if you aren't the best driver in the world.\n\nThis is quintessential if you're into off-road racing of any variety.","November 5, 2015","true","219.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

But this... Dirt Rally... Has topped them all.\n\nIf you, like me, had the misfortune of playing Dirt 1/2/3, you probably won't be expecting much from Dirt Rally initially, but if you're looking for a proper rally simulation with outstanding sound quality and the real feel of flying down a dirt road with mud and water soaking your car as you pray you don't hit the tree up ahead, then you won't be dissapointed.\n\nIt's got it all:\n- Excellent Graphics\n- The best sound effects i've ever heard in a rally game\n- Just absolutely gorgeously modelled tracks, from dried out greek dirt roads, the snowy hills of Sweden right down to the muddy Welsh moorlands.\n- Large selection of cars that you actually want to drive! None of that random dirt buggy stuff from the previous Dirt games. Ford RS200, Ford Sierra, Peugeot 306, Mini classic, Lancia Delta Integrale and tons more.\n- Oh! And no terrible cutscenes with a pro-active nobody telling you that this is your caravan and that great things await...\n\nCodemasters have managed to go back to the nitty gritty roots at the core of Rally. Dirty, dangerous and hair raisingly exciting, and pack it all into a single game with a pretty low pricetag.\n\n--I use a G27 wheel/h-shifter to drive with, it's well supported, the FFB is great with only a little left to be desired on tarmac imo, and it's really responsive--\n\nDo I recommend this game?

Average being around 4 or 5 minutes long. Would be nice to have longer stages to mix things up\n-While car setup has a nice depth to it, they're still set by sliders.

It is rougthless, unforgiving, muddy, nerv-racking, rage inducing piece of awesomeness. You don't get any tutorial or some ♥♥♥***le that narates your every step like DiRT 3, it throws you in the pool without any warning and you will fight for your life and BY GOD you will fail without tomorrow and I mean it. You will crash, by god you will crash so many times that you will curse the time you bought it, but that's what is the BEST part of this game because you will try to get better. It doesn't have a difficulty setting, the difficulty comes with experience, because every car behavies completely different from the other and every stage have different effect on your driving. Your best chance of success comes from hearing your co-driver and your reaction time. I read of people bashing this game cause of "the physics of the game is trash !!1" or "the updatez don't fix this or that". WRONG ! Every update makes the game even better than before, and every car that's get added, it's a new challenge and you want to use it on every challenge again and again. The background audience are crap, but who cares ?! Will you buy this game for the generic audience or for the breathless setting you are driving ? Filland fills like Filland and Greece fills like Greece, no stage is the same even in the same country or even when you drive the same stage backwards. The car deteriorates even if you drive like a pro, you know why ? Because that's what happens in real life too, aggressive driving deteriorates the car faster and puts you first while cautious driving deteriorates the car slower but you loose time and standing in the champioships, LIKE IN REAL LIFE ! A rock in the road can either send you corrining of the road or damage your tires and make you loose time. Every decision matters. The car sounds are spot on. Don't try it with keyboard, it's impossible, try at least with a controller but as soon as you get the cash invest on a steering wheel with force feedback and possibly with a gearbox because you will need to make the gear changes yourself, because the game has a bad habit of putting the wrong gears on the most critical times.\n\nI can go on for much longer, but the bottom line is this. If you like REAL rally games, then you own yourself this game. If you are new to rally games, then start with this game, before you even touch any other rally game.\n\nEnd of story.","November 18, 2015","true","38.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","3"

First of all, I AM ALL TO THE PAIN SIM DRIVER! (I was so afraid to buy this game because of ARCADISH style of previous ones - FEAR NOT and buy now !)\n\nFew years of Richard Burns Rally (raw, rsrbr, rbr-world), iRacing, Live for Speed etc. I will write some more in free time - I have to rally some more now!\n\n\n\n\nTHE GOOD:\n+ soft-lock is a great feauture~! (you don't have to set rotation of your wheel for each car, you put it on max and the game will do the rest, fixing it to a current driven car)\n+ Rally Cross mode is plenty of fun. The cars feel much better than the ones from rally mode, a bit too slippery though, it feels like driving on ice most of the time\n+ dashcam is way to go, forget the cockpit view if you strive for the maximum realism. It looks and feels amazing~! I just wish more cars would have shift-light and gear inf box located higher so we could see them in this view\n+ 306 Maxi + German special stages on tarmac are so much fun\n+ driving on a rim (without a tyre) is not fun :)\n+ with higher difficulty, the weather conditions get worse (night, snow, rain etc.) Unfortunately, only your visibility is affected... the handling stays the same...\n+ I can't get enough of how rain looks like... simply amazing\n+ WRC Ford Fiesta handles beautifully on Welsh stages!\n+ night + heavy rain = heaven!\n+ amazing lighting work; it looks so incredible when you are driving through shaded areas and the bright sun rays are falling into your cockpit\n+ if you hold the handbrake with RWD cars without clutch you can stall them, yea!\n+ your gears can pop out, if you have damaged gearbox!!!\n+ daily, weekly and monthly online events where you can't restart! YEA!!!\n+ sounds!\n+ graphics (about which, I really don't care - but it looks amazing)\n+ overall pleasure from rallying!\n+ I expected much worse\n+ water-splash is so sick!!!\n+ car repairs\n+ sense of speed\n+ it is already much better than RBR!!! Can you believe it!? No?! Me too! BUT IT IS - trust me!\n+ I can't stop rallying already and I am driving the slowest car~!\n+ great animations of cockpit, you can see your feet working on gas, brake and clutch pedals\n+ logitech g27 @ 540* works like a charm!\n+ SS (special stages) look amazing!\n\n\n\nTHE BAD:\n- NOT EVEN CLOSE TO RICHARD BURN'S RALLY! ARCADY AS F*CK... It is far far away from being a simulator... It is plenty of fun but I don't think it will even come close to RBR...\n- zero respect for the speed... you can drive 100km/h, hit a tree and still drive without any consequence... PATHETIC!\n- [PARTIALLY FIXED - all surfaces feel weird] during the rain, you can't tell the difference between wet and dry surface... ARCADE BS!\n- zero respect for Monte Carlo stages... too much grip... too easy... ARCADE BS!\n- you can barely slide the car unless you use a handbrake...\n- [FIXED - clutch override option added] there is no MANUAL SEQUENTIAL GEARBOX + MANUAL CLUTCH... which is real WRC car setup\n- the power of WRC MINI on tarmac is some kind of a bad joke...\n- you start rolling after a great crash and the game resets you on the road... stop with this arcade BS!\n- terrible ARCADE DAMAGE SYSTEM! You can literally bounce back from walls... - bring the deadly one from RBR!!! No mercy for arcade noobs !\n- when you fell out of a road, it takes one button to recover... WTF!? It should be at least 30sec of penalty!\n\nTHE UGLY:\n~ [PARTIALLY FIXED... still not fair]=[all cars except for WRC have now delay when using sequential gearbox, very good idea] people driving with full manual setups and zero assists ( h-pattern + manual clutch = it is so much HARDER ) should not be thrown into bag with other drivers using different easier setups.\n~ the cars slow down way too fast when you are not accelerating!\n~ not enough stages in my opinion. Even though the location are very nice, they get boring rather quickly...\n~ [PARTIALLY FIXED... still feels slugish]=[latest ffb patch made it so detailed, I don't know if I should rally or admire how nice it is! Now you read the car behaviour instead of fighting with a wheel. Feels amazing! The car is ALIVE!!!] FFB feels like I am driving every car without a power steering, I constantly have to fight with my wheel... after 13h+ of rallying it is so bloody annoying!\n~ [FIXED]=[latest ffb patch made it so detailed, I don't know if I should rally or admire how nice it is! Now you read the car behaviour instead of fighting with a wheel. Feels amazing! The car is ALIVE!!!] definitely needs more details in handling (although some icy parts of the road were amazing and they have sent me straight into a wall)\n~ how can you not let us change different tyres for different surfaces!? It is rally FFS!\n~ [FIXED]=[latest ffb patch made it so detailed, I don't know if I should rally or admire how nice it is! Now you read the car behaviour instead of fighting with a wheel. Feels amazing! The car is ALIVE!!!] FFB needs to be much more detailed, it feels very sluggish at the moment - still nice though\n~ [PARTIALLY FIXED... the gears still pop out randomly]=[they pop out now only when gearbox is damaged or when you have not pressed clutch all the way down during a gear change] gears from my H-pattern pop out from time to time; not sure if bug or simulator thingy\n\n\n\n* After more than 63 hrs on record of rallying in Dirt Rally, I have found myself missing the real professional sim... and started racing in iRacing again, even though I do not like track racing. This game is really good, and plenty of fun, but it is as close of being a simulator as Counter-Strike is... It will never be a sim, everyone with a little piece of working brain, can see where this is heading... Do I still have a hope for it to become one? No, not anymore. This is nothing more but a good arcade rally game. If they will keep advertising this as a sim, I will change my review drastically, they do not deserve this word SIMULATOR, describing this title!\n\n\n** After 67 hrs on record, I am too irritated with stiff handling and almost none existent weight balance to continue... As I said before, it is only an arcade game and they have no idea about simulations... I want to punch them in the face for talking about simulating a drop in power, on high elevated special stages, when they let you hit a wall at the maximum speed without any consequence... This is not the biggest problem though, you are not taking pleasure from hitting walls, right? Rally is all about the skilfull handling of the car, the way you do it, you balance the weight of the car. Unfortunately, you can't feel it, in this game at all. The physics feel off, cars are too stiff, unresponsive, underpowered and god knows what else... Even the sound of the cars became dull and boring after a while... Those are rally cars god damn it! Let them sound like monsters!\n\n\nNow, I can clearly say that RBR is still no. 1, such a shame...\n\n\nEDIT: After coming back from a month or so break, game feels amazing again. The RallyCross is fun and the cars actually feel like the WRC should have... It is a great game... I am just angry because I know it can be the best rally simulator ever created, I just hate the idea that they are trying to please both; arcade turds and sim freaks like myself... Unfortunately because of this, the games falls somewhere in between... Too hard for total arcade noobs, and too arcady for a real simulator... What a shame...\n\n\n\nMore incoming soon!\n\n\nThanks for reading\n\n\n--\ntgchan.com","May 14, 2015","true","81.5"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","21","30","0","5"

Wrong. Why? Read below.\n\nLet me say few things first. i am 30 year playerwho love racing games. I played Dirt 3 and i was with Codemasters from my young days playing CMR 2.\nFirst i was thinking "oh another rally game with arcadish feeling, let me give it a shot and i will refind it if i don't like it".\n\nOh boy i was wrong.\nFirst game welcomes you explaining this is early acess game and your feedback is needed, what they say is true. Game is in early acess but you have feeling it is complete product. I have ASUS laptop with 6Gb of ram and AMD HD 8670M with 1 Gb, game runs without problems on 1366x768 on high details and it looks beautiful, no hickups, no crashes, alt-tabing is easy and so far i did not see single problem with it.\nSound is good and loud, co-driver is loud enough so you can understand him without problems, also you are getting corner notifications on middle of the screen that are clear and perfectly readable.\n\nNow for driving feeling.\nI am playing this game on keyboard, standard arrow keys. It is perfectly playable but you will need to break a lot of sweat to finish stage. I am planingnow to get racing wheel just because of this game but that will not be so soon because i need to collect money and explain my wife (tough part). But yes it is perfectly playable on keyboard but if you want more realism and drive it on your racing wheel i am sure you will not be dissapointed. Cars have different driving models and you can feel Codemasters give their best all cars feel diferently and i can say they have great sucsess.\n\nNow for actual driving.\nYou have setup for cars before every stage, you can adjust bunch of settings such as brake bias, gears, suspensions. Spend some time there so you can setup vehicle for your taste because default settings are ok and if you know what you doing you can tweak them even more for extra seconds.\nDo not expect you will sit in car and go 200+ Km/h doing sick drifts and tricks. No. Game is not that easy.\nYou will have to sweat your palms a lot to keep car on road and moitor every corner, calculate every jump and listen your co-driver all the time. Game is not forgiving errors and even if you do fell off stage you can recover vehicle which will result in 10+ second penalty or more depending how badly you crashed.\n\nDamage is done realisticly, tires will pop, suspension will go off, water will boil and engine will cut out, your body will be crushed like coke can if you hit a tree or spin.\nYou can fix your car in between stages, you have limited time for every part so you will need to think good about fixing priorities. For example you will be able to fix engine and gearbox but not body and exhaust so think good what you need and balance it acordingly.\n\nI can proudly say i am glad i bought this game and i have no doubt i will have a lot of fun playing it. If you are searching for brilliant rally that is realistic search no more, you found it. Even if you are rookie this is great game to spend money and time on.\n\ni just want to say one big Thank you to Codemasters for this game and i am hoping they will continue adding content to it.\nI will see you all online, on dirt. :)\n\nHave fun, God bless.\n\nBoris Radijacija","June 17, 2015","true","48.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","1"

Learning curve is very high especially if not use to rally and can be a little frustrating but I personally would not want it any other way for a game like this.\n- Excellent environment providing all of it's elements including ice, rain, snow, dawn, night time racing with functional headlights and more.\n- No need to really go into further details, it is as close to Rallying as you can get without actually being in a rally. Even the co-drivers voice has a sense of urgency under fast technicals and can hear some shakiness in voice on uneven/bumpy terrain. Maybe it's my imagination as once you put your concentration into the game it gets intense, but voice for slower parts of the course does seem more calmly put.\n\ngame 10/10 for an early access with well executed content so far.\n\nI do think the game can get a little more real to induce more awareness and caution i.e.) sometimes you can smack rocks and trees and keep going. /shrug\n\nMy game runs extremely fluid with minimal fps drop and if it does it'll not affect my experience. I have game on ULTRA.\ni5 quad 3.5\nGTX 970 Nvidia\n8gb RAM\n\nThis game has me considering even putting out for a logitech g27.. game is that good of a driver imo. I've been playing with Xbox One controller thus far and tuning it to run properly is very hard as a controller cannot beat the pedal travel and the stick cannot replicate a steering wheel at the slightest. (Often times you end up full lock either direction on the control stick, or I just don't have the finesse to finely move the stick minute amounts to deliver low steering angle...) I have played shortly on a wheel set up and I think it does this game the much needed justice over the controller and especially the keyboard. If this game does come out for console, I'm sure they'll have the game calibrated to easily accomodate controllers.\n\nI cannot comment on the multiplayer as I've yet to try it, also hoping for more cars, environments, and tuning options of course. I've also not checked either steam or their main forums but I hear from other reviews before I bought the game that developers are very much looking to bring the best rallying simulation possible and I hope they keep it as real as possible for future as well. This shows with their constant updates from a outside looker point of view.\n\n*Caution: this game may not appeal to ricers as you cannot\n- Slam the cars\n- Stretch the tires\n- Run -20 camber with the said above\n\nbut you can and will scrape; as a bonus, possibly brake an oil pan =P\n\nCouple of tips:\n- DO NOT CUT, there are solid obstacles or big gaps that it's possible to destroy your car completely or severely injuring it for the remainder of the race.\n- Look ahead, if you see some major openings to set yourself up for speed do it","September 7, 2015","true","38.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

These days I race with an Obutto Ozone cockpit, G27 wheel and pedals, and a Fanatec Clubsport Shifter SQ.\n\nLet me just say that Dirt Rally is a superb game and racing sim in most respects. If you have interest in rally racing (both modern rally and vintage/historic rally,) it's a safe bet that you will more than get your money's worth out of the game. So now to break it down a bit more:\n\nPros:\n-Wide variety of cars, broken down into very interesting categories such as 60's FWD, 80's RWD, Group B 4WD, and so on.\n-Each car behaves uniquely, even among cars in the same classification\n-SUPERB sound design; close your eyes while watching a replay and you'll swear you're watching a Youtube clip of a real rally stage.\n-Five beautifully modelled countries to race in, including Greece, Monaco, Wales, Germany, Finland, and Sweden.\n-Fully modelled Pikes Peak, including before full paving (partial dirt road) and after full paving (all asphalt)\n-Rally cross tracks, with online multiplayer\n-Realistic handling and force feedback effects (the physics and FFB are not hardcore sim quality like iRacing or Assetto Corsa, but certainly lean FAR more towards sim more than arcade)\n-Time of day and weather settings for all tracks, which provide gameplay variation and challenge\n\nCons:\n-Needs more rally stages, because you'll start to recognize sections quite quickly as play each stage more and more\n-The rally cross and Pikes Peak stuff is neat, but feels tacked on (a bit of the old Dirt games, in a way)\n-The interface is clunky; although it's been improved greatly since the first Early Access release, it's still not intuitive and will take some getting used to\n-As good as the sounds are (best in class by a long shot, really) there are a lot of minor issues, such as silent turbos in all of the turbocharged cars, at least on my 5.1 system\n\nThis is an all around fantastic game, and I can't say enough good things about how the developers have listened to customer feedback from the beginning. I'm very hopeful that they will create some DLC with more countries or stages to rally in, and more vehicles to enjoy.","December 25, 2015","true","78.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

They seem to be adding new content fairly regularly, all of which so far has been of a very high quality.\n\nIt's early access so there's a couple of small bugs here and there as of writing this review which I'm sure will get fixed, but nothing major. Alt tabbing the game means it switches to windowed mode which is annoying, and starting without launch control sometimes results in a jumped start even though I'm in neutral with the handbrake on. Otherwise I haven't noticed any other bugs and it hasn't crashed once.\n\nThis is the best realistic driving game around right now, and one of the only games I would recommend buying in early access.

Logitech had the best hardware ever brought to the consumer market when it came to the sticks and the cables and the motors.  It made a decent racing/flying game an absolutely riviting experience.  To give an idea of why directional force feedback matters, try getting into a go-kart at a local kart racing place.  Just rent a kart and go around the track.  That wheel will fight you around every turn, and it makes the driver/road connection a real wrestling match.  This is also what it is like racing a full sized vehicle off road, on gravel, or on dirt.  When you push a vehicle to the limits of traction and beyond, that wheel becomes quite a bear to content with but it also gives you feedback about what the vehicle is doing that is less obvious otherwise.\n\nSo feedback like this makes a racing experience more real.  Cool.  In addition, the tiny little sticks that most consoles use (like the 360 controller) don't have the fine degree of control that something like racing needs.  The tiny sticks are great when it comes to analog direction, but not so great when it comes to distance between center and fully pressed in a given direction.  This isn't important for all games, but the shortcoming becomes obvious in situations like racing.\n\nI play games sitting on the couch, with a projector screen in my living room connected to my PC.  This means a wheel and pedals would be quite cumbersome, because I have no desk to clamp such a monster to.  My experience with wheels is that they are often less precise than a large joystick, and certainly less precise than an actual hydraulic/cable driven steering wheel from a car or kart.\n\nAll this is why I bought this joystick.  I bought such an old one because they don't make large, directional force feedback analog sticks like this anymore as near as I can tell, the market trends just aren't pushing them.  This old stick requires no drivers in Windows 7 x64, so it really is plug and play.  The old Logitech stick I used to own/sell is technically superior, but it isn't compatible with newer flavors of Windows so it isn't an option anymore.\n\nAs to the experience, I actually bought Dirt Rally after having some difficulty setting it up with Dirt 3, seeing that Dirt Rally just came out, and reading an interview that says they added analog stick support to the default controller profiles set up for Dirt Rally.  I did get joystick support and directional feedback working with Dirt 3, but it just feels wrong, and it needs to be tuned in some manner because it will literlally throw me off the road even when I have the force dialed back to a mere 10% in the game.  The force reduction doesn't seem to work and the motors are strong enough to literally muscle you off the road, if the game/stick aren't tuned or tunable to work well together.\n\nI did have to go in and set the stick and the throttle (built into the stick) as needed so Dirt Rally knew what to do with it but once I did, the motors in the stick snapped to life and the stick was suddenly ready to go (it sits in a relaxed state with the stick lounging to the side until a game talks to it).\n\nI jumped into the first track, with the first car.  WOW!  Not only did it bring back memories of playing on my old analog stick and driving racing games like Need for Speed or Star Wars Pod Racing, even better, it reminded me of getting behind the wheel of an actual vehicle and carefully driving around mountain roads as I get a feel for how far I can safely push the vehicle.  I wasn't fast.  I wasn't a speed demon.  It felt like driving a real vehicle.  It wasn't relaxing, it was edge of your seat stuff!  I nearly felt like I had left my house, and had an adventure as I get a feel for gravel roads, as the feedback goes from pushing against you gently, to pushing harder, to going slack when you slingshot past a spot and know if your angle of entry wasn't good you are in trouble because the steering went slack due to a sudden and temporary complete lack of traction.\n\nThis game isn't flashy.\n\nIt isn't about eye candy.\n\nTracks take longer, like real driving does.\n\nThis is the game that gets you into racing.\n\nThis is the game that gets you into racing games.\n\nThis game is the reason you get better controllers.\n\nKudos, and thanks for getting me back into racing, and giving me a reason to get into force feedback that is more than mere rumbles!","December 9, 2015","true","1.7"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","1"

This game amazes with great physics, beautiful graphics, and a challenging set of race stages. It might be too sim-like and complicated for children with the extensive car set-ups and difficult runs, but the cars drive so realistically with a wheel (g27 here) it is incredibly immersive and provides a compelling racing experience.\n\nThe cons are that it is still pre-release at this time and while the online challenges provide a sort of multiplayer, it still doesn't have true multiplayer races which I will be disappointed if they don't add eventually. And I'll be annoyed if this is all you get and the additional promised content will be DLC that you have to purchase after the "official" release of the game. Nevertheless, for the prerelease cost it is an awesome game that is worth buying if you like driving games with realistic physics and great graphics. My feeling is that the work Codemasters put into the physics paid off and they have a winner in this genre.","May 2, 2015","true","234.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

You need money and points to progress through the game. If you damage your car it isn;t easy to repair it, you have limited re-starts and the AI is difficult to beat. It is a hard game to get into and you need to listed to call outs and get a feeling for the game\n\nI woudl highly recomend a controller or a Steering wheel as it is almost impsoible to use a mouse and keyboard to play this game.\n\nIt would be nice to see a dificulty setting and a unlimited carrer mode where you can have any car in whatever championship. The rally aspect of the game is really good, I do really enjoy it. However the hill climbing, not so much. The hilly climbing cars are far to powerful and spinn out whenever you go near the throttle i think there needs to be an "rookie" setting for this game mode as I find it very hard to do and most of the time I jsut quit out of frustration.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game but only if you are looking for an hardcore rally if you a\re looking for a game that is easier and a bit more fun with more veriety I would highly recommend DiRT 3.

Dirt 3 was about a collection of cars you had all the access in the world to, and increasing driver level unlocked new cars. DR took the classic route of "if you want it, you gotta earn it!" buy unlocking them with in game currency earned from races. But this game is so far beyond just that simple principal of drive>earn>buy. You have to hire a pit crew who maintain and tune your ride, pay for repairs, keep the crew happy, it gives an authentic feel of running a rally team outside of "this is my car, there are many like it...". And winning makes more money yes, but winning takes REAL work! The cars in this game handle nothing like they did in D3, I've driven my poopy personal IRL car down a dirt road and I have to be just as careful in this game as driving IRL. Crashes ruin your runs, and you get no rewind system. The ONLY assist in this game is your co-pilot, and you have to focus on the road, and what he's feeding you and misinterpreting what he says or not even listening can lead to your car getting wrecked. And the damage system in this game is brutal! I lost a tire mid-race and had to either chug on without it, or stop, and add a few minutes to my stage time replacing it. YES. YOU REPAIR YOUR CAR MID STAGE. And this eats time, which affects your position, which affects your earnings.

All simulators should look up to this. Over a year has passed since Early Access, and we all saw this game evolve. There were monthly updates and constant patches that brought this game to it's full glory. Constantly adding new cars and tracks, tweaks and new game modes. This game has really realistic engine, cars are badass, from early '60s to Modern Beasts, it has it all. It has rally on every type of surface (Dirt,Gravel,Snow,Tarmac,Ice..) , to every weather condition possible (Sunny,Rain,Snowy,Fog...). Career mode is well designed and really entertaining, making you start rally with '60 vehicles, and then you slowly progress trough generations of cars. There is hillclimb, featuring Pikes Peak, 20km huge hillclimb. In hillclimb there is 2 car classes and 3 types of surfaces. Also there is WorldRX also known as RallyCross, where you have 3 classes (Since  of Console Release) and RallyCross also has Multiplayer feature.

My below EA impressions summarise the feel and flow of the game well enough so I don't want to repeat myself.\n\nReally impressed with the sheer amount of content for the price too, lots of different cars and locations on offer. Codies back at their absolute best!\n\n10/10, cracking game. Best virtual driving experience I've had in years.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS:\nDisclaimer... I would hardly call myself an expert but I've been driving things fast since I could reach a steering wheel. Mostly karts, with the odd single-seater and tin-top hoon.\n\n+Handling: This thing is hard to master, and I ♥♥♥♥ing love it. The handbrake is my new best friend. I've genuinely not had this much fun with virtual driving in a long time, it's just so involving and physical. It's easy to get going at a somewhat competent pace, but to effectively carry speed you need to go full Finland. Pretty much the closest I've personally felt a game has come to a true driving 'experience' anyway.\n\n+Presentation: Slick as ♥♥♥♥, functional, tidy. Does what you want it to fast, and it's very easy to navigate. I love the Colin McRae 2.0-style car outlines, and the doodle pace note icons. It feels like a true-to-heart, wonderfully British rally experience. Awesome stuff.\n\n+Stages: Perfect in length, and there's already enough variety in there to keep me busy for a while. They're just long and different enough to keep me on my toes, but not so much that I can't pick it up and start zoning out from pace notes after a few attempts. I hate being overly attentive to them anyway.\n\n+Cars: I was surprised by the decent selection we have to kick off with considering the price, good stuff. Seems like a no-messing attempt to get the best rally vehicles possible so that's fine by me. I like how it's split into decades too, nice sense of progression (not just with age but speed!).\n\n+Sound/Graphics: I've seen a lot of praise for the former but honestly, both of these seem a minor at best improvement over the stellar Dirt 3. Not a bad thing, I've just not been blown away visually as yet. It's nice and clean though, does what it needs to do. I like the co-driver voice, sounds like a top bloke.\n\nISSUES SO FAR:\n- FFB can feel a little muted at times.\n- DFGT wheel seems to not be recognised every now and again, and the resultant pause messes with the steering lock / overall FFB feel. Restarting sorts it.\n- All audio drops out if I try to play with the 60's Lancia. No idea why.\n\nOVERALL:\nWhether you're an old-school Codies fan or mildly interested in the rally genre, you owe it to yourself to give this a shot. Seriously, expecially for the price, it's ♥♥♥♥ing good.","April 29, 2015","true","57.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

I have played this game now for 5 hours now, still havent won a race, placed 3rd in my first world champinmship, but am loving every second. The driving is challenging but rewarding, no mini-map, only your co-driver to guide you. And when your racing through Wales in a Stratos with no front lights, good luck, its all ears and alot of guess work, but you can do it.\n\nThe only thing that i think needs work is the co-driver calls, there are some corners that are rated 1 but should really be a hard turn.\n\nBut apart from that, if you like racing games, id suggest this because I havent seen a racing game in some time quite like this one, and its worth every penny.","May 3, 2015","true","21.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Would I recommend this to you? If you're looking for a challenging driving experience, I would say go for it.\n\nThe game speaks for itself in a lot of ways. It doesn't hold your hand. The only way you're going to get a podium finish in this game is if you fight for it. But the satisfaction of finally getting there is part of what makes this game so great.\n\nI've never focused more in a video game than I have in DiRT Rally. Whether it's in the lush countryside of Germany or the steep rocky trails of Greece, they all have one thing in common; the courses are beautiful. The level of detail in this game is astonishingly well done. The courses presented are true to life and do an excellent job of capturing the scenery. I've found myself slowing down a few times just to admire the view. Whether that view is of the landscape or the car I'm driving, it's always a treat.\n\nThis game has a lot more to offer than just good visuals. With 39 cars available, ranging from the 60s to modern, there is something here for everyone (personally I can't get enough of the 95' Impreza). While all the cars aren't terribly different from one another, at least not in the same category, they each have their own little personality that can make you love them or hate them.\n\nAlongside the career mode that you can progress through, there are also daily, weekly, and monthly leaderboard challenges. These really help the longevity of the game since it's literally infinite challenges. You can also just create your own tournaments or do quick runs on a chosen course(s).\n\nIf there's one thing I can say that disappointed me with DiRT Rally, it's the number of courses. After you spend many hours with the game, you start to learn locations by heart. Suddenly your co-driver becomes more of a nuisance than a valuable guide. It loses a little of its luster after that. I understand that recreating iconic courses like this is very expensive and time consuming, but it's a little disappointing nonetheless.\n\nThis is one of the games I hope they release DLC for. I would gladly fork out some cash for some more content of this quality.\n\ntl;dr\n\nOne of the best rally experiences ever created. Get it if you're a rally fan and are up for a challenge.\n","March 13","true","154.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","2"

JUST BUY THE GAME!"\n\nAhem, right. Now there is a new update, version 0.9 early this November that adds a number of cars and updated the drive physics.\nFor the better, of course.\nI can't belive how sensical things have become. Mind you, I'm not very good in this game, and despite plunging in the game quite early, I don't play it as much as others because of one thing, RageQuits. And being angry playing this game is a good thing. Bear with me.\nThis is the most realistic driving simulation I have ever played. I heard news about Dirt Rally being released on Early Access from a popular image sharing in the interweb (not Instagram). I learned it's going to be true rally sim unlike those useless gymkhana stunts on previous DiRTs I never got the hang on after many hours.\nI was excited to read rave early reviews saying how it was going to exceed all previous iterations of Codemaster's DiRT games AND even Richard Burn Rally, the pinacle of Rally games. I tried RBR once, it was a pain to install, with all the necessary mods that took ages to download, and I didn't like the graphics, I didn't like the feels. The practice on that game alone was ridiculous hard and unrealistic. It didn't have support for my Logitech G27 and I won't waste my time getting my wheel working on a game that allows a car to slide around in gravel at 30kph. I played Shift 2 since, and became quite confident with my skills. I tried pCars after that, the physics was similar though I wouldn't say I'm happy with how cars handles.\nBut DiRT Rally is something else.\nIt's out of this world.\nNo, seriously. THIS is the holy grail.\nIt is Early Access, already in v0.9, but you got a fully functioning, mostly bug-free game that runs like a good completed game of the old days. Remember the times when we use DVDs to install games and we can play that game smoothly and comfortably right after installing it, without any Day 1 patches? That's how good Dirt Rally runs out of the box.\nSure there is occasional bugs and hastles, but with each iteration it's mostly fixed and if the game hangs on you, perhaps it's about time to take a rest and wash your face. You've probably driven more than 100km in one sitting.\nWhatever price you pay for this game, it's worth it. You are essentially paying for a complete game that runs superbly well and in each month, there is a massive update giving players new features, new cars, and new game modes (probably). Think of it like buying a complete Rally game and earning free DLCs along the way. YEAH!\nSo I dusted my olde G27 and hooked it up to my new gaming PC, built around this game!\nBought my first Mini and hopped into the car.\nAnd man, I did fell off a cliff.\nThose reviewers before me are not joking.\nThis is the real thing. This is the S-word-I'm-not-allowed-to-say. This justifies my new $1500 gaming rig.\nWhat you get is punishing Rally game that is as close to the real thing as it can be. There isn't any other game like this and sadly, I don't think there will be any other after this. RBR survived a decade for a reason. The masochists that we all are did not have anything else to channel our needs.\nDiRT Rally gives that in a beautiful and accessible way. No, you won't have to install mods and spend wasteful hours setting up your gears. Plug in a steering wheel and start driving.\nEven better now is the new RallyCross pack.\nThat is the Holy S-word-I'm-not-allowed-to-say Fun I ever had. You are inside a jet engine that accelerated like a rocket and turns in four wheel against other cute rockets. Cute rockets that wants to end your Monday like a goat with murder tendency.\nYour opponents, the AIs, are sick enough to butt you, slam you off your lane, ram your back, flick your tail and send you to a separator, destorying your radiator. They are violent and I like them violent. It gave me a reason to be just as violent.\nThe tracks are simple enough. When you first started RallyCross, it was just a simple oval with the trickiest bit being the joker. Now I don't know what that is at first and I hope the Devs would take some time making an in-game Encyclopedia for every rally terms in the game, but basically, it was a speed bump everybody had to take once. As you got better, the track got longer and more complicated, and boy, you will soon learn your limits and you will get addicted to want to break those limits.\nNow, the new November update completed drive physics for each car. I currently drove a Quattro, not the best car, I know, but I'm comfortable with it. The ride was stable enough and I'm never going too fast to my taste. But the new update makes me realise that it was actually weird going so stable around Wales in the rain, plunging through dips without my car bouncing about and hitting the trees, because that's what happens afte the update!\nIs that a bad thing? Of course not. It threw me off balance, and I have to re-learn the car again, but thinking back, it's probably how it should handle. You're going over 100 on mud anyway, how could it possible you're going straight with the throttle hammered down?\nThat's what I love about this game and the team at CodeMasters who are responsible with its development. They worked very hard to make sure every detail makes sense. It might not be a perfect sim, I don't have a reference point because I don't do real world rally. But playing this game also makes me a better driver in the real world. You know, I kinda feel it when I could slid the tail of my car, it just takes a little nudge up the handbrake, just a little bit and I'm skidding, but no, won't risk it.\nBecause just as in DiRT Rally, you don't perform risky manuevuer to show off. You aim to deliver the car across the finish line. Sloppiness and the urge to try something stupid, like ignoring your navigator will send you crashing, and more often than not, going slower does make you go faster.\n\nThis is the game to buy if you are a masochist perfectionist.","July 4, 2015","true","46.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","7","7","5","0"

The driving felt pretty comfortable. Didn't have any problems with it besides that I'm an inexperienced sim driver and sucked at it, but for that short moment I had so much fun. The feeling threw me back somewhere in time I hazily remember playing Live For Speed and sucking at that, too. But most importantly, it felt real.\n\nSeriously don't try this with keyboard ...\nFor now, I have to make do with a controller only. Mind you, this one is so cheap it doesn't even have the analog bumpers like a ps3/4 or x360 /XO controller, but your mileage may vary (no pun intended). The settings offer full keymapping for every input type, this is great. Main input devices are keyboard, gamepad, or wheel and pedals (I guess there's no reason not to play this with a flight stick or guitar hero controller if you really wanted to.. (update: tried, guitar controller definitely works)) and basic gamepad/controller is the middleground here. Manageable, in my case. I, like many others, would recommend that you shouldn't start this game with a keyboard, at the very least go grab a controller from your favourite console and you are set, maybe after minimal control tweaking. The defaults are impractical, imho.\n\n\n\n\nI might update this review when I get more hours into the game.","May 31, 2015","true","8.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","7","7","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/youraveragejoe/recommended/310560/","youraveragejoe","Great Joe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/youraveragejoe/","360 products in account","This and Toybox Turbos are both examples of what Codemasters can do when they rein in the budgets and give their titles focus. Both titles benefit, and we finally get to see another fully realistic rally game as a result. The controls have no weird kinks, there's no overlong segues between menus, it's just pick how long you wanna race for, pick the car you wanna race in and a loading screen later you're on a track.\n\nYou might be scared into thinking that a fully realistic rally game would demand a several-thousand-dollar Fanatec setup, but I've been playing this game on a cheap Ikea desk with a Logitech gamepad for half a year and I can get top-100 times using just that. It takes practise, sure, but no more than on that complex sim setup.\n\nThis game is now out of Early Access, and there's two main gameplay modes: Time trials on special stages, as in classic rally tradition; and Rally Cross, that being a six-car race on a short track with a mix of on-road and off-road sections. There's no tutorial, this game relies entirely on its progression mechanics as a way to teach you. You get just enough money to buy a slow 1960s car and you get pitted against other equally slow 1960s cars. The game also makes it explicit that you have no chance to win your first few championships by having you earn upgrades every time you use your car, its way of saying that it's okay to take it slow and just learn how to handle the machine you're in. Those first stages become oddly relaxing, and an exercise in just learning the track and the car.\n\nThere's other similarly relaxing mechanics in place. You start with a mechanics team who can't properly mend your car after a stage, and you won't be able to pay for one for some time. You're forced to make the decision between driving fast and suffering on a later stage, or driving slow and- oh hold on, I got a better time. That's the beauty of it, the game teaches you to drive slow without ♥♥♥♥ing up, and thereby saving you tens of seconds.\n\nContrast this with Dirt 2 and Dirt 3. You'd start with cars that go too fast, handle terribly, your only clue for how to drive is a literal rainbow road and instead of a proper tutorial or forcing you to learn your car, those games just had a mulligan button. As soon as you learned how that first car drove, every car after would be a cakewalk. Dirt Rally shows that you can have proper teaching tools AND be fun AND be a completely realistic simulation at the same time, and it's very much to Codemasters' credit for achieving that.\n\nThere's some excellent asymmetric multiplayer going on. The last few Codemasters games did have online leaderboards but this game takes that aspect and really runs with it. You can create your own league where your friends can join in and post times on specific events, any time of day they want. It's a great way to keep a group of friends competing with each other.\n\nI do have one complaint: Dirt Rally could do with some optimization. Some stages play at a stable 120+ FPS, others might dip below 30 on the exact same settings, including weather. Setting weather to High (not Low, which is slower) and trees to Very Low helps. It's odd.\n\nThis game has some great voice acting. It's only one actor, he only plays one role, and he's your copilot. There's genuine nervousness in the way he reads his notes, at times he skips a beat and you just know going through all this he's pumped up on adrenaline. It's the perfect way to fill in the silence left by the menu music, and lends a lot to the game's serious racing atmosphere. Though the fact that he makes wrong calls is a bit unnerving. Not sure if that's a bug.\n\nI heartily recommend this game.","December 27, 2015","true","135.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

But, midway through a love affair with Driveclub I came across Dirt Rally.   That was a few weeks back and I haven't played anything since.  It's incredible and I didn't even realise that I liked sim rally racing.\n\nIt's definitely difficult but somehow that makes it more accessible, which is weird.  It's like the Dark Souls of racing games.  And it's a beauty to look at and runs extremely well on a pretty modest PC (1st gen i5 and 2Gb 7870 here).\n\nI have hundreds of hours gameplay left with this game, and even after I've seen everything in the game, I can imagine playing this for a long time just because it's so exciting.\n\nLastly, I did have fun with a pad, but pretty soon I realised I needed a wheel so bought a secondhand Logitech DFGT for peanuts, and it's so much more satisfying and fun to play.  So, I'd recommend getting at least a budget FFB wheel and if you are on a budget I don't think the DFGT can be beat.","September 2, 2015","true","213.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

If everything goes well, it could be the best rally sim since RBR.\nA pure rally sim is what we need after so many years.\n//////////\nEdit 2015/5/27:\nFor now, I have to change some of my previous thoughts about this game.\nI've played almost all CodeMaster racing games except some F1 series, they all feel the same. CodeMaster made all their racing games feel like you are driving on ice. I feel better the days before Dirt, the whole EGO engine times. Dirt, dirt2, dirt 3, dirt count down, grid, grid 2, grid autosport, fuel, F1 2011, F1 2012, F1 2014, every EGO titles I can remember, they all feel the same---driving like on ice.\nI think CodeMaster never hired some real driver to qualify the car physics, and almost every racing titles CM made are better controlled on joysticks/gamepads rather than on racing wheels. We invited many people who has deep real world driving experiences including some real racer to try out many CodeMaster racing titles both on gamepad and racing wheels. All of them can drive pretty good on racing wheels with racing sims like rFactor, iRacing, NFS13, Simbin titles, the new AC. But few of them feel good on any CodeMaster racing titles when driving with racing wheels. It just feels too fake on the car physics. CodeMaster racing games only perform good with controllers like gamepads.\nTill now, after many hours of test drive in Dirt Rally, I admit everything goes better except car physics.\nIs this one a Richard Burns Rally successor? Definitely not. Maybe some arcade racing fans would like this. But for a sim racer? Let's go back and play RBR.\nI may change the advisory after its official release to "Not Recommended". Just be prepared.","April 28, 2015","true","134.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

Until Dirt Rally came up that technically combines a realistic feel with nice graphics and a career mode and multiplayer leagues that is fun to play.\n\nFirst of all, the support by the developers is OUTSTANDING. This is the first early access game that is fun to watch as it's doing a BIG progress with continuous updates and new non-DLC content. Frequently new stages, cars and even game modes have been released, handling is tweaked, bugs are fixed, performance improved - that's amazing. The developers really read the ideas and suggestions on the DIRT forums and implement respective functionality into the game. This is the first Early Access game where I can clearly feel the developers absolutely developing a game according to the player's feedback. So the many, many positive reviews here on Steam are very well deserved.\n\nThe handling:\nI've been used to older Dirt games, but also played Richard Burns Rally a lot. RBR was supposed to be the most authentic rally sim and drifting in RBR was actually really easy. Somehow I believed that RBR is top of the notch and after playing Dirt Rally in a very early stage, I thought that Dirt Rally is far away from being realistic, because cars won't drift the way I want, engaging drifts and doing hairpins wasn't that easy as in other Rally Sims. However, the more I played, the more I noticed that the "unrealistic" handling is actually only a result of my bad driving skills, because in Dirt Rally you actually have to know what you do with your car and how to set up your car to make it drift the way you want. The more you learn about car physics and rally driving techniques, the more you'll notice that Dirt Really is very accurate in simulating the car handling under specific conditions. You can really feel a big difference in the setup and the different car types such as AWD, RWD and FWD. You can use all sorts of real world driving techniques to get these different cars to slide the way you want and it works pretty accurate. Whenever you do a crash thanks to oversteering or understeering, there always is a logic explanation of what caused the car to behave that way. Thus said, after 25 hours of drifting and sliding through the game, I honestly consider this to be the most authentic handling when it comes to rally games.\n\nThe career mode:\nThe career mode is actually a really nice one, at the moment divided into Classic Rally (With co-driver), Hill Climb (Without co-driver) and Rally Cross (The non-Dirt3-like realistic version). You're not going to participate in single events, but always in whole championships that are divided into different countries which again are divided into different rally stages. Once you're through all events and land on the podium on the end of the championship, you're allowed to participate in a more advanced championship with of course more advanced AI opponents. Thus said, the more you advance, the more difficult it gets. So as a beginner, you'll most likely have problems winning the first championship on the first try, but on the second try you most likely will. The championship system always ensures you got a proper competition, so the game is never too easy or too hard. It will keep you challenged, but it's not too frustrating. Indeed it is very motivating because you can clearly see how you improve your times and driving skills during time until you reach the next championship level. Also you got the ability to repair your car each and every two stages you drove. Your mechanics got half an hour to repair a wide selection of different car parts, all having an impact on the driving. If you drive stages at night, you better repair the head lights of your car before you tweak the suspension. So you always have to make wise decisions on what you actually are going to repair during that half hour. However, you can also entirely destroy your car so it's not repairable. If this happens, the championship is over and you'll loose everything.\n\nTeam management:\nThere is also the ability to manage your team. You can hire crew members, and the more skilled these people are, the more they cost, but therefor they need less time to repair specific car parts throughout the championship. You can check how long their contracts will run and you will have to make sure that none of the contracts is expiring during your championships. You can fire people, replace them, and your team will even level up the more you drive in events. Good stuff: It's not important to win to level up your team and car, but it's only important that you actually drive. The more KM you drove with team members hired, the more they will progress and level up. So even if you got stuck on a specific difficulty, driving and playing the games still provides a progress. If a specific member reached a level up, you have access to perks which you can buy to even improve the power of your team.\n\nCar upgrades:\nAnother nice aspect is that when you play the championship events, not just your team levels up, but also your car. The more KM you've driven with the car with a specific team, the more your team is going to know your car. So after some kilometers/time, your team starts to install weight reductions/engine and turbo upgrades to your car. Means the more you drive an actual car in your garage, the faster and more powerful it gets since your team keeps improving it. So even without winning championships, you're still earning money for new cars and upgrades for existing cars that make your favorite cars even faster.\n\nMultiplayer leagues:\nYou can register and create an account on the RaceNet website, allowing you to keep track of your progress and driving statistics, comparing yourself to other real drivers and participate in online multiplayer events. Also you can race Rally Cross events together with other people on the same track, so you can actually crash and bump into them. This is nice to see your skills and times compared to other real world players.\n\nGraphics:\nNothing much to say - the graphics are outstanding for a simulation game and look really good. On ultra settings on my machine it sometimes doesn't look exactly as nice as the preview images in Steam, but generally the graphics are nothing someone can moan about.\n\nThat's all I had to say - this game is technically outstanding and unique in many, many ways. Plus in some months there will even more features by the developers that have not been taken into account on this review. I can just recommend this game to ANYONE who is either a rally fan, likes racing games in general or pure simulations. Everyone is going to have fun with this kind of game, no matter if you like the simulation or if you want to play it with a game pad in an arcade style. Definitely a big recommendation from my side.","November 18, 2015","true","62.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The stages are longer, way more realisim, the graphics are improved and the menus (to me at least) look way better than the DiRT 3 ones. One thing i will say is that you should probably get a racing wheel pedals and a gear shifter, i feel like it would make it so much easier to control the car without some of the assists. Anyways, I dont have any major problems with the game except that it would randomly kick me out of fullscreen mode, I'm not sure why it does it, but its not game breaking as it pauses the game when it happens.\nI would rate this game 9.8/10\n\nGreat game CodeMasters keep it up!!

Having stumbled upon DiRT Rally, and having purchased the title on a whim, I'm can honestly say that the game has completely exceeded my expectations -- even in its current Early Access form.\nI'm no seasoned racing-sim professional, not by any stretch; however, it seems that DiRT Rally is set to deliver a bona-fide rally driving experience in what is a serious departure from the arcadey, lowbrow mayhem for which the DiRT series has become known.\nThe game is visually gorgeous and the sound-design is spot on. But what's most impressive is the feel -- the handling of the vehicles, the physics, and the immersion. Although cliche, the game really is easy to play but difficult to master. It offers a challenging but highly rewarding experience that I've not known before in any racing title. Comparisons have already been drawn to Colin McCrae (also of Codemasters fame). Such comparisons are totally warranted.\nThere are some obvious limitations with the game at the moment.

It's an amazing feeling to drive, pshysics are insane, pure rally feeling.\n\nI highly recommend this game for everyone who loves rally and motorsports BUT only if you have a wheel with force feedback! You not gonna enjoy this with a keyboard nor with a controller so think about that before you buy.\nSo thanks Codemasters for this! Can't wait for the Winter Wonderland pack!\n\nWhat I'd like to see :\n-Random hazards like in WRC Evolved (It was amazing back then and very unique)\n-Damage model already great but I'd really like if the suspension break out or something, fire if the car really broke you know what i mean.\n-More WRC's like Fabia WRC or 206, I think there's already enough old cars.\n\nSo I recommend to buy it because you not gonna find better rally game for a long time I think.\n(Sorry for my english)","November 23, 2015","true","88.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I've enjoyed the Collin MacRae series and the only other game to get close to that was the first Dirt, after that it's all been arcadey games which didn't make me feel like I've actually was doing anything.\n\nThis one is more than that and more, it has heart and it looks like the developers actually want to give us something out of their passion for the series and their roots.\n\nI've only played close to two hours and I'm enjoying the career mode a lot, I really enjoy being able to repair and change my roster and things like that. Makes me feel like I'm in charge!\n\nLooking forward to see where this game goes over the development period, highly recommended :)\n\n---\n\nUpdate: Now that the game is released, this is by far the best Early access game I had the joy to be part of.

Having stumbled upon DiRT Rally, and having purchased the title on a whim, I'm can honestly say that the game has completely exceeded my expectations -- even in its current Early Access form.\nI'm no seasoned racing-sim professional, not by any stretch; however, it seems that DiRT Rally is set to deliver a bona-fide rally driving experience in what is a serious departure from the arcadey, lowbrow mayhem for which the DiRT series has become known.\nThe game is visually gorgeous and the sound-design is spot on. But what's most impressive is the feel -- the handling of the vehicles, the physics, and the immersion. Although cliche, the game really is easy to play but difficult to master. It offers a challenging but highly rewarding experience that I've not known before in any racing title. Comparisons have already been drawn to Colin McCrae (also of Codemasters fame). Such comparisons are totally warranted.\nThere are some obvious limitations with the game at the moment. But far from being nit-picky I will let the development run it's course and post a more thorough review upon full release.

There are a lot of cars and various real-life stages with the challenging bumps and road width, and the co-driver is generally excellent in guiding through stages. Cars generally feel and sound fantastic on gravel and snow. The only downside for me is the unrealistic tyre model and  abrupt dynamic behaviour on asphalt. On the whole, I would wholeheartedly recommend DiRT Rally to anyone to enjoys the exciting world of motorsports. 8.5/10.\n\n_________\n\nCars and tracksThere are plenty of iconic rally cars from several classes, such as modern WRC machines, classic ‘70s, contemporary R4 cars to vehicles from the Group B era. In total, thirty-nine cars are available, and it is very noticeable that each have a specific handling. Thirty of these cars are available to drive in point-to-point rally stages. One particularly good aspect is that most of the cars sound very realistic in engine noise, and that they really seem to have a raw roar/irregularity to them as heard in their real-life counterparts. There is an upgrading system in the career mode; cars start out underpowered and overweight, and only after driving them several hundreds of kilometers, they will have the correct figures. Consequently, drivers that do not belong to the top 5% or so will have a hard time to win rally stages until they drive further.\n\nIn terms of tracks, currently there are six countries: Greece, Monaco, Finland, Sweden, Wales and Germany. Each country features two unique long stages, which are around the 10 km mark, or between the high six and low eight minutes of driving time, depending on driving skill. Smaller stages are just segments from all the main stages. Furthermore, the stages are also offered to be driven in backward direction for more variation. The best thing, however, is that these tracks are modeled after parts of real rally stages. Stages can be very bumpy and upsetting cars, and at times are very treacherously narrow. When the co-driver calls a ‘caution’, it is imperative to drive slower and more accurately in order to avoid crashes. In my opinion, this aspect really makes the game fantastic to play. The only downside is that stages tend to be somewhat repetitive since one rally can consists of short stages which appear again as longer stages. Additionally, players who play this game many, many hours will find that at one point the stages have become familiar and that a co-driver is not necessary anymore, which personally takes a slight bit of fun out of the game. From that point of view, it can be argued that more track variety is needed, but I feel that the game offers plenty of tracks for at least several tens of hours of fun.\n\nNext to normal rallying, there are three rallycross circuits and a few special rallycross cars with up to 600 horsepower. Additionally, there is the Pikes Peak hillclimb, which is being offered in a fully-paved layout and a part gravel, part asphalt layout. Currently, there are a few historical hillclimb cars, such as the Audi Quattro S1 and the Peugeots 405 and 205 T16. Overall, content-wise there is much to offer, in my opinion.\n\nGame modesThere is a career mode, in which rally stages are offered sequentially per country. While changing between countries, it is possible to switch cars. Online multiplayer is offered only in rallycross mode, sadly. For point-to-point rally stages, the only multiplayer component is comparing stage times with friends or the rest of the world. Furthermore, it is possible to setup specific leagues with set rules and regulations, and there are periodic events organized by the developers that offer nice moneraty rewards.\n\nCo-driverOne of the best features in the game; the notes are clear and when set to ‘very early’, most of the time are very reliable in facilitating driving fast down a road that is not entirely familiar to the driver in advance. In high speed corners, the co-driver also talks faster and in a more severe tone, while he is calmer when driving slower. There are only a few slight mistakes in corner severity numbers being called, but overall the accuracy is very high. I find it a joy to drive without the HUD and being able to fully depend on the co-driver in this game.\n\nDriving dynamicsAnother important aspect that has made the game so much fun for me is the handling. In basic terms of dynamics, the cars feel realistic; modern WRC machines are very neutral, have very short braking distances and carry enormous amounts of speed through corners with high control, whilst older rear-wheel drive cars (especially from Group B) are very twitchy and unforgiving under power, depending on the exact car model. While playing, it is not uncommon to spin under power, and avoiding such a spin is hugely satisfactory. All other cars sit in between these two extremes; generally, the older the car, the lower the overall stability of the cars during acceleration, braking and coasting. What I also like, is that any driving over the limit will result in brushing the walls or trees, often resulting in car damage or at the very least a loss of time. It makes the game challenging, but also very rewarding at the same time.\n\nPersonally, I find the handling of DiRT Rally on gravel (Wales, Greece, Finland) the most realistic: braking distances are longer now compared to the previous early-access handling and feel spot-on. Furthermore, cars do not loose too much momentum when sliding sideways through corners, but instead it is simulated that the wheels dig into the gravel surface and generate more lateral grip. The quantity of weight transfer (or actually wheel load transfer) on this surface feels the most accurate to me, because it is possible to make the car ‘dance’ between corners while being sideways. The same applies to pure snow and ice (Sweden and parts of Monaco); there is a fluidity in the cars handling that requires a certain precision in throttle, braking and steering inputs.\n\nHowever, the cars may be too forgiving when exaggerating inputs, which brings me to the remaining surface: asphalt (Germany and parts of Monaco). This is where the game is at its weakest; there seems to be no realistic relation whatsoever between grip and slip angle (the difference between the angle of the front wheels and the general direction the car is travelling in). The problem is that there is a lot of grip when expected, but that grip loss happens very abruptly and untrue to rubber tyres on asphalt.  At higher speeds above 100 km/h or so, it is not too bad, since cars do grip and generally understeer under power when going too fast through a corner. However, at these speeds there is too little sideways slip, so driving sideways and having to correct with the steering in third gear or higher like in onboards videos on Youtube is sadly not possible. The lower speeds is where the handling simulations lacks the most: this is where the cars do oversteer, but the rate of angular acceleration is far too great to be believable. Unfortunately, this phenomenon also means that the best stage times are achieved with a lower steering angle settings since slides can be corrected quicker and unfrotunately, without a loss of stability. In real life, the fastest way would be balancing between too much and too little steering input, and for that reason, I personally always set my steering wheel at 900° of steering and therefore always lose some speed, even though the recommended by Codemasters is 540°, and the fastest people even use 270° or less. Despite this crazy car behaviour and optional 'physics cheat', the driving is still sufficiently enjoyable on tarmac. Still not great compared to gravel handling, but acceptible.","February 13","true","115.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

I found out very quick that you have to finely tune your vehicle and finesse it through every track, alot of skill to build in this game. At the time of this review I'm only sitting at around 15hrs or so but from what I can see there are a lot of tracks to race on and vehicles to unlock or should I say purchase.  Again it's nothing like any of the previous DiRT titles, it's an actual simulation now instead of an arcade game.  It's punishing, I'll say it again..IT'S PUNISHING.\n\nNow you get a crew chief and get to hire and upgrade mechanics, in between stages you can repair your car.  The graphics are beautiful and the sound is great.  To be honest I was shocked when I first started playing, I couldn't do anything or keep my car on the road because I was so used to how the old DiRT titles played.  I stepped back took a deep breath and began to start respecting the game for what it had evolved into, an effing simulation.\n\nOnce I learned I had to tweak my car settings for every single track and gave the game respect I started picking it up and learning to drive again.  In the old DiRT series you really didn't have to make serious adjustments for most tracks anyways, in this game you really need to...or you will fail.  Also I read some other reviews about people playing with a M&K..not going to happen...you need a controller by default.  This game actually makes me want to go out and invest into a wheel and pedals, I have never ever considered that until now.  I'm about to take my nerd level up a notch.\n\nI played DiRT 2 the most even after DiRT 3 was released since I was so ashamed of DiRT 3 and all of the Gymkhana whatever stuff they forced into a series of races.  Now that we are back to DiRT lets keep it here please, this game has redeemed the series and for that I am truly grateful.  The game just feels and looks and sounds so good, and there are a lot more customizable options now to your cars, I don't want to spoil it but you have to "unlock" the good customization options. You are going to need them, the more you drive a car the more your team becomes familiar and the more unlocks for your customization abilities for that particular car you are granted.  The nice thing is all of the liveries are already unlocked giving you a little bit of flavor right off the bat, but the new customization replaces you being able to unlock paint jobs.\n\nThe game feels balanced, the physics are very punishing and realistic and you will grow to respect the track and your car very quickly.  I have not found a track I dislike yet, they are modeled so well and the physics of each track are so amazing and..whats the word...brutal.  One other thing about the DiRT series I always loved was the replays, and they are just as amazing now as they always were.  There is no more rewind your mistakes, now its "reset" your car with a time penalty unless you can drive out of your mistake quicker than resetting your car.  You can resart the race but you will lose a specific amount of credits that are given to you each race as a reward for not using the restart feature. Eventually using the restart enough times in one race will render you with zero bonus credits but they will not affect your original credits you will earn for finishing the race.  Very well done on Codemasters part, they are very balanced on punishing you as a driver without robbing you. ;)\n\nThey did a good job with this game this time around folks, you can plunge into career mode "like me" or go test drive any car on any track on custom championship.  In career mode they don't necessarily throttle you to go a certain way, it's basically up to you and how you spend your hard earned credits towards vehicles in order to access certain tracks and races.  Codemasters deserve a nice little pat on the back, job well done.\n\nIf you were or are a rally or DiRT fan and want to kick it up a notch or two buy this game, you won't regret it.  It's punishing and beautiful and lots and lots of replay value.","May 15","true","25.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Codemasters think they have a solution in DiRT Rally, which marks a strong departure from the 'arcade' feel of previous DiRT releases.\nThis review covers the current (April 2015) Early Release version of the game. It is split into four sections, the first dealing with aesthetics, the second with video, the third with audio and the fourth with gameplay. I've listed pros, cons and tips/suggestions for improvement.\n\nThe aesthetics:\nPros: Minimalist theme, logical and intuitive menu navigation design\nCons/suggestions: A dark 'theme' option for the menu would be great for tired eyes, more options could/should be made available for areas like the HUD. Specifically on the weather, perhaps there should be a system where the seasons, time and weather conditions can be set independently, as at the moment there are only presets.\n\nAesthetics rating: 7/10\n\n\nThe video/graphics:\nPros: A refined engine which doesn't overstress the system, fantastic attention to detail and good texture resolutions. Harsh weather means genuinely poor visibility\nCons/suggestions: The game appears to be using the existing game engine\n\nVideo/graphics rating: 7/10\n\n\nThe audio:\nPros: Adds so much to the immersion in each map, e.g. windscreen wipers make a noise, the sound resolution is good\nCons/Suggestions: More speaker options could be useful\n\nAudio rating: 10/10\n\n\nThe gameplay:\nPros: Rewards good driving, strongly punishes poor driving, more immersive than most games I've played. Changes in terrain are obvious but subtle enough, changes in vehicles and vehicle setup are obvious, each car feels as though it has its own personality\nCons: On a couple of stages it was unclear which direction to head in even with the pacenotes, I got a graphic driver issue when I went the wrong way on one occasion\nSuggestions: A tutorial system for the vehicle setup would really help\n\nGameplay rating: 7/10\n\n\nOverall rating: 7.75/10\n\nFor an Early Release the game is in fantastic shape in my opinion. There is still a lot that can be improved but thankfully nothing fundamental. Codemasters have got the basics right with the driving, the physics and the immersion, with the audio a clear step above previous DiRT releases.\n\nKeep up the good work!","April 28, 2015","true","23.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

What they need to sort out/improve is the FFB (Force Feed Back) and deadzone for wheel users. The FFB is kinda like in typical Codemasters games where there isnt enough information coming through. Heavyness and vibrations isnt enough for a sim/simcade and its not enough for people with good wheels/pedals. There is also a rather large deadzone, but it hasnt bothered me too much so far. Both issues can be tweaked a bit. People have come up with XML tweaks to make the FFB better for example. Still far from good, but better. However its hard for people coming from titles like Assetto Corsa where the FFB is great, and so far Dirt Rally has quite a bit to go before it gets anywhere near Assetto Corsa quality FFB. Personally i dont need that good FFB to enjoy Dirt Rally, but it needs to get better. From what ive seen i think Codies will try improve the FFB. At least i hope so.\n\nReal review coming later when Codies have gotten further with Dirt Rally - Early Access. Would i recommend it now? I think yes. But only if you are ok with FFB not being very good yet, and you got money to spend on a WIP game in development. The core game here is great. The stages/cars looks great and the physics feel pretty darn good, and there is no typical Dirt coolness to menues or the rallying itself - its a much more mature/realistic rally game that is harder and more realistic than the usual Dirt series (the discussion board is filled with the typical "Dirt" clientel that asks to make it easier - lol). With FFB improvements and less deadzone this will be very nice if they keep it the way it is.\n\nI have to add something. Ive read about people saying the performance is bad in Dirt Rally - Early Access. So far i havent experienced that on my humble machine. I run most on HIGH with a few settings on MEDIUM.

Ever since I was hooked into it from Rallisport Challenge 2 on the Xbox. I haven't  played a rally game that was as great as that since. I have finally found it. This game is exactly what I wanted from the moment I started the first couple of races. My laptop can only run medium settings and the game is still gorgeous. Very well optimized. The feel of the cars are just perfect(no assists on). I haven't got too far into it so I don't know how much content there is. I don't care though, I am just happy that I finally got my long awaited rally racing gem. Thank you Codemasters. This is it. Last time I played a great rally racer was when Halo 2 was popular. So lets hope the new Halo lives up to that fact.","October 4, 2015","true","96.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","6","7","3","2"

I can't stop playing. This game is a masterpiece even in it's unfinished form.\n\nEver since the day Codemaster released ColinMcRae Rally 3 I've loved the series. Recently they moved from a more serious all out rally feeling to a more "arcadish" offroad racing game. DiRT Showdown was in my opinion, a terrible game. They hit rock bottom there and there's many reasons I think so (which I will not write about here). I played DiRT 3 alot and I think it was overall a very enjoyable game. I also like the fact that there was many different types of racing. However, the longer this series has been going on, the more they have moved away from what it started with. I'm not saying eveything always has to be the same, but if you change something, you want it to be better - or atleast as good, right? I think their series went downhill efter DiRT 2. Not unplayable, but worse. Showdown became the final stand. I thought "I guess the DiRT days are over...". Then, without any advertising or news about it, a friend said they have a new game called DiRT Rally, so, with hope that Codemasters would better themselves and produce a game not just based around Ken Block and doing donuts infront of a crowd, I purchasd it *nervosity intesified*.\n\nWas I shocked... Yes I was. We hear about how "graphics is not as important as gameplay", "graphics doesn't matter" all the time here on the internet. While it is true that a game, with only good graphics but no fullfilling content, is not a good game, you have to undertand that graphics does enhance the gameexperience for most people. However, I am sure I could play this game without any graphics at all. Because the physics are right there. I have never in my life played a rally game that is this hard to master.\n\nSeriously, it is so hard. Realistic? Perhaps. I think it feels vrey much right on all surfaces except asphalt (which in the game can be played in Monaco). You may not agree, but I don't really think that the physics are correct there or it's just me having a really hard time understanding it. Overall, the physics are amazing and the game is definately worth you money if you want to play a realistic rally game. It's very very hard and don't even think about playing it with a keyboard.\n\nI first played with my keyboard and it was impossible. Then I went on to hooking up my G27 wheel. It didn't feel right. After that I plugged in my Xbox 360 controller. Just right. For me the controller is the easiest but I think it's all about preference. Don't bother with the keyboard thought, just don't.\n\nIn the game you have a variety of cars to choose from. They are not very many, but sufficient enough to keep my occupied for now as every car needs to be driven differently and every car handles very different. The Championship mode is ver short and doesn't really feel like a complete championship but I'm sure it's going to be more later (atleast I hope so). Now they will also be adding Hillclimb racing, which I am very exited about. To end this review, I'd like to add a list of things I'd like to see in the game. I believe this game all the potential to become awesome and maybe even the best rally game I ever played but it need alot more content. Since it's only on Early Access though, I believe there will be more. Here's my list:\nBigger Championship mode\nMore stages\nMore cars\nChanges asphalt physics\nMore types of racing like hillclimb, rallycross, and so on. Don't be afraid to look too much like DiRT 3 in that aspect. We still have the amazing physicsengine and no Ken Block. I'm just asking for more diciplines.\nTrucks in hillclimb :)\nChampionship in every dicipline\nAnimation of people fixing the car between stages like in ColinMcRae Rally 3.\nRally Championships having 1v1 superstage at the end.[/u]No hate, just my thoughts.[/u]\n\nWonderful game, good graphics, incredible physics. The potential for this one is HUGE.","May 6, 2015","true","353.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","6","7","3","0"

The most reasistic rally-driving experience you can get today (on PC at least). Since Richard Burns Rally came out a decade ago (if you remember it, like I do, i'm sorry, but we're too old to play videogames anyway), this is a must have if you want to enjoy an authentic sim without Ken Block, bright colours and stunts. The game might seem easy at first, but it all changes when you try the fast cars - they are unbelievable. And yes, the wheel is recommended. Tried playing with an Xbox One controller, it is bearable, but your driving reflexes don't work with controller sticks as well as they would with a proper wheel and pedals, like when you get sudden oversteer, for example.

I could not believe the level to which the game (and my driving abilities) were improved with a decent quality force feedback wheel and pedals. I siwtched to manual gears. Assists were drastically reduced. It was remarkable.\n\nSo I dumped some money on DIRT Rally, as I love the genre and thrill of the sport. Sadly the market has been so quiet for a few years so I've had to be sated with the occasional forays back to the terrifying realism that is Richard Burns (RIP).  But loading up DIRT Rally? Wow! The immersion provided with decent peripherals take the whole driving genre to a new level. The quality of the force feedback the game provides and control of the cars is something else entirely. Pushing a twitching Renault 5 turbo over an ice patch on Monte Carlo rally and feeling the steering go light as you try and rescue the car before you hit the wall is heart-stopping. Pikes Peak in a rainstorm?! The feeling of total control and knowledge of the grip that is on offer at each corner of the car. The butt-clenching feeling of helplessness as you've overcooked that "Left 4" in the forest, or desperately hanging on to the wheel over that sequence of terrifying Finland jumps knowing you need to claw back a few tenths but may may well be destroyed in the process of trying. I've played rally games since the dark ages, but none has hit me like this since the original Colin McRae. This game really is incredible. But it's real. It feels real. It looks utterly amazing. The sound is spot on (to anyone that doesn't have a garage full of Group B cars, at least). The co-driver is faultless. The differentiation in feel and driving techniques needed in the variety of cars and surfaces is truly humbling. And the main thing is this: every corner you ace, every yump you spot perfectly? That was you.\n\nProper goosebump stuff - Truly an incredible game. Play this, poop your pants, say "Thank Goodness it's just a game - a terrifying and utterly immersive game"... then go watch a Youtube link of Colin in the woods  and realise that people actually do this!","April 19","true","49.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It isn't a "sim" as much as people say it is because of a few "things". It is difficult to say where that game sits as it seems to be based on a hardcore sim idea, but with a less sim-like finish to make it accessible. Still, it will give you a hard time and will require a lot of dedication to stop crashing into trees and rocks.\nThere is no real modern competition and it is still one of the best driving games so far. You won't regret your purchase.\n\nDetail:Pros:\n- The UI is clean and works properly\n- Good controller support and user-friendly settings\n- Very good co-pilot, his voice changes according to your speed and doesn't sound robotic at all.\n- Visual damage is excellent\n- Driving like a rally driver pays off, pacenotes are crucial\n- Physics compared to the game's direct competition, though they aren't perfect (see cons)\n- Each car has its own specific behaviour\n- Engine sounds are good\n- Career mode serves a purpose\n- Daily events - despite giving pretty lame rewards IMO\n- Excellent optimisation: Very good graphics with pretty low requirements.\n\nCons:\n- The co-pilot isn't consistent through locations. In Germany, his calls are too late so you end up braking too late, and in Finland it is the exact opposite. I shouldn't have to change how early I want the calls to be every time I enter a different location.\n- Physics to a certain extent. Yes, they might be the current best ones for a rally game, but you can still feel that they are a bit Grid Autosport-ish, especially on tarmac. Cars overall have too much grip on gravel, and not enough on tarmac. Mid-engined cars pendulum effect is exaggerated and the 208PP just gives me cancer as it oversteers all over the place at high speed.\n- Failures: Yes, you do have punctures but hitting a tree at 60mph won't damage your car to a point where it is a simple DNF. You can hit rocks at 90mph, your car will go on. Richard Burns Rally was much more punishing on this, and I'm disappointed there is no slider to choose how punishing crashes should be.\n- Career mode to unlock cars' real stats is silly, to be polite. I guess they needed to justify the career, but still I don't know why the f*** I should have 220bhp on my WRC until I have enough mileage to unlock its real 300bhp.\n- No tire selection.","April 24","true","132.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Unlike previous games in the DiRT series, DR leans more towards proper simulation. There are no flashbacks, you can't repeat races indefinitely, you can't turn off car damage and time penalties for car recovery are very harsh. You can also tune your ride to your own preference, gain upgrades, and hire a team of mechanics to keep your car in good shape.\n\nAs the title implies, this game is all about rallying, so say goodbye to Gymkhana and "BRO SICK RACE BRO, YOU GOTTA POST THAT ON YOUTUBE" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The tracks are really good, they're well designed, the circuits are longer than before and the environments look impressive. Car physics are stellar, you can literally feel every bump on the road. And the audio is just superb, you can hear the gravel hitting your car, you can hear the brakes grinding when you push them too far etc. As far as i can tell, the game is also really well optimized. Quality work.\n\nDiRT Rally is in early access, but it's already rich in content, and it's going to grow at least twice in size before release.

The devs are active and seem really open to ideas and feedback plus you've got the assurance that its definitely going to be finished as its Code masters.\n\nGameplay is stunning, driving is really smooth and fluid, physics are great and the courses are really good too, very much like real life courses (might even be real?).\n\nBy far the best thing is the damage simulation, to see the body parts warping and twisting is crazy but beyond that you can smash windows, break wheel hubs, puncture tyres and damage countless other parts of your vehicle.\n\nSure it has its issues, occasional graphical glitches, the car recovery system needs work and there's other tiny niggles but nothing you wouldn't expect in a EA game, to be frank in its current state it better than most recent AAA releases.\n\nIts worth noting a lot of wheel users are reporting some minor issues with things like wheel syncing and FFB but again CM are active on the discussion hub asking for reports and feedback to nail it down properly.\n\nThis is going to turn into a great game, if you like driving and/or rally sims then you should buy this now while its cheap.","April 30, 2015","true","2.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The physics are great, the graphics are good and most importantly, the gameplay is superb.

It provides a semi-simulation feel that lets it sit with other more serious racing games without becoming inaccessible to those looking for a fun rally game.\n\nPlays great on a controller, but probably would demand a wheel for those looking to get most out of it.\n\nPresentation is outstanding with great graphics and sound that emulate the aesthetics and grit a rally event should. The attention to detail is really appreciated.

Love the accuracy of stages such as Sweet Lamb, unlike in games such as WRC 4. I think it is great that all the older cars are in it, but I don’t think that as much time has been put into the post 2010 cars. As a rally driver in Britain (fingers crossed Europe soon) and one of the first privateers to receive the new Ford Fiesta R2T kit, it would really appeal to me to see some modern 2WD cars such as a the DS3 R3, Fiesta R2 and 208 R2. It has been announced that Rally Germany and Pikes Peak will be released but haven’t read that new cars will. I just hope the FIA isn’t in full control of the rights to using these cars in games. The game is really only playable on a wheel as I said it’s more a simulator game, but if you are committed enough you will get to grips with keys. This game is a must buy for any motorsport fan, well priced and can’t wait for the DLC and updates. If you are a supporter of rallying buying it at this stage will show commitment and improve the game even more.","May 4, 2015","true","85.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ivbb/recommended/310560/","ivbb","GreedyIV","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ivbb/","73 products in account","DiRT Rally takes sport seriously, but it has some problems too.\n\nPros:\n*Great driving - fun, responsive, each car feels different.\n*The tracks are dangerous and punishing\n*Driving with a steering wheel, with no HUD and assists (just the co-pilot) is a BLAST!\n*Graphics are nice\n*Online events create an amazing competitive feel and variety.\n\nCons:\n\n*This game suffers from the syndrome where you fall out of the track and your car gets instantly put back, BUT sometimes it actually DNFs you and shows your car as unrecoverable. This makes no sense, since at times I can fall out quite far and be put back and at other times I get a DNF with sliding out just slightly and if you proceed, then you are DNF'd from the WHOLE EVENT - this makes ZERO sense. Sometimes you slide out quite slightly (experienced it mostly in winter stages), you get an ''unrecoverable car" and you can't even progress to the next stage) - and at other times I can hit a wall at 150 KM/h and keep racing. There is NO balance here...\n*The crashing visualisation is very weak compared to other Codemasters games - I was actually expecting, that I crash and destroy my car and it would make sense that I can't continue, but that doesn't happen. Sometimes it is too easy to blow my tire (after a minor crash) and at others I can't get any response from a crash. Read the previous point - it works together with graphics, where it almost always seems illogical, how you can/can't continue a race.\n\n\nThe biggest issue for me is those annoying fade out->fade in(put back on track) sh*ts - it's stupid! Let me crash properly and make a proper response in visual and actual damage! (There is always a restart option.... except where there isn't)\n\nThis game has a LOT of things I have always wanted in a real rally game, but others pull it back at being the same old same old. Generally, if you make to the end of the race and don't crash - it feels like the best thing EVER, until you crash....\n\n7,5/10 (it is a good score, btw - still recommended)","March 12","true","39.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stanza_nate/recommended/310560/","stanza_nate","johnno89au","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stanza_nate/","67 products in account","Firstly, up until now not one single racing game has made me cringe even close to what I do in real life when heading towards a tree, barrier, bank or other solid object with way too much speed. Given that I've bent or broken at least half of my cars while racing and I was a big fan of the venerable Richard Burns Rally (& the RSRBR mod), I like to think that's a good indicator of the tone of the next two words.\n\nUntil now.\n\nDirt Rally is the best rally game in existence, bar none. RBR was just as good for it's day, but if we'll be realistic it's now over a decade old & it's time to move on. Dirt also captures the sense of speed better than RBR ever did and it's perhaps even more punishing on mistakes - especially in the online Daily, Weekly & Monthly Events. There is no rewind, no restarting. You crash, you're done - they way it should be.\n\nNow, to the game itself - I'll start with the short list of negatives.\n- To be honest, I actually feel the cars may have slightly too much grip, however this is coming from over a decade of RBR. It's not 100% sim, but it's more than close enough.\n- The stages are made up from one stage per country. This provides heaps of content if you only drive the short stages but it's easy to start memorising the courses after a while.\n- The only hillclimb is Pike's Peak.\n- No Australian stages! I live in Coffs Harbour & would absolutely love to be able to barrel along some of our brilliant local WRC stages in game.\n- The damage model is perhaps a bit too forgiving.\n\nNow, for the positives.\n- Aforementioned cringing when heading face first into a tree.\n- The graphics are top notch, on max settings it looks absolutely stunning - but still is a little bit much for my R9 390!\n- It's really, really well optimised for PC - the scaling is huge. That's somethign rare in these days of crap console ports.\n- The handling. I did say above that it felt a bit too grippy, but it's easily the best on the market at the moment. Really, it's more than enough to create a realistic portrayal of rally and it feels totally natural once you get used to it. I suspect a lot of my problem is I'm playing with a XB360 controller as I don't have a wheel yet.\n- All the stages, Pike's Peak & the Rallycross circuits are taken from real life tracks - Col de Turini (Monte Carlo), Ouninpohja (Finland), Sweet Lamb (Wales/GB), Baumholder (Germany), Pikes's Peak, Hell (Norway), Lydden Hill (UK) and others. Most are very close, although there are slome slight variances on the rally stages; presumably to save HDD space and make the stages more exciting.\n- The cars are excellently modelled & sound great too. In fact, all the sound work in the game is top notch.\n- The co driver & his pace notes. I'm so glad they got an actual navigator to read out the notes for each stage, as they sound so much more natural and the timing is mostly spot on. There are a few late calls that can cause some panic moments here & there, but you learn to drive around them. That's part of rallying and overall they've done a fantastic job.\n- The daily, weekly & monthly events. These help to change it up a little & add a fair bit of pressure to race fast & clean, as there are no restarts - you spin, no rewinds or restarts. You write off the car, you're done, that's it. The wager events add to this immensely, with the opportunity to get good money if you drive well but lose even bigger if you don't. Absolutely love it!\n\nIf you're a rally fan or even just a driving game fan or car enthusiast, pick this one up. It's worth every cent at full price, and then some.","May 10","true","84.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Dirt 3, in my opinion, was a mess, the rally was quite fun, but the rest of it was just utter sh*t. But this, this masterpiece that Codemasters made, is the most intense and thrilling rally "simulator" I have played to date.\n\nThere is honestly nothing wrong with this game as to date, but, I believe the external damage, such as door panels and bumpers, etc, need a bit of work. When I do multiple flips, I would love to see my whole car pretty much ripping apart.\n\nOverall, this game is just amazing. The rally aspect just feels so unique and Codemasters are all over this game in terms of updates and hotfixes. It is truly just a breath of fresh air in the rally simulation world.

The first few attempts I didn't finish because the game has a damage model that you cannot disable, so now playing pinball around the corners. In spite of the DiRT name, no Circus, no overhpyed coolness, just a plain and simple Rally game. You don't get magic repairs, after two stages your crew is allowed to spend half an hour patching you up with duct tape and chewing gum, and damage persists over the whole course.\n\nRoads have a realistic feel, and most of all, a realistic width - you don't drive on six lane highways.\n\nI suppose the hardcore fans will miss more setup options than the ten or so settings you can change, but that is fine with me.  More Gran Turismo type parts would have been nice too. If there is anything negative I can say about the game, I'd say there aren't enough locations, but then, this is Early Access so this is perfectly okay. Please bring back Kenya :)\n\nI have no problem recommending this game.

(I love crashing the most XD). Sometimes it just wants to roll over and give the road a kiss, about 5 inches from your face Its just like car torturing simulator 2015 (make that next?) and I love every minute of it.\n\nThe accelerator also isnt a pedal its an adrenalin injector stuck in your arm that coincidently sets off a moderate engine backfire as your ♥♥♥ clenched after going 80km/h around that hairpin just next to that ♥♥♥♥ing large drop.\n\nPeople have asked 'Is this game too hard for me to play?' Maybe. I can play it with a controller that has a broken thumbstick and still finish a race; does that help? ( Here is me playing the original DiRT  Here is DiRT rally) If its too hard turn on the assists thats what they are there for :) I myself play automatic transmission because i just cant gear with a controller.\n\nIf I can give one piece of advice its to start off slowly at first and just try not to hit anything then try and drive smarter (racing line, drifing, accelerator control. Yes accelerator, line and braking is probably just as important to control as the wheel in cornering fast) to increase your times the custom race mode is good for practice as you can do any track with virtually any car and it doesnt cost you anything.\n\nGotta say ive played every dirt game so far and this is the one with the most challenging (and immersive) handling and sound. I think it got something back that was missing in dirt 2 and 3. The feeling of nailing a hairpin and sliding around it (you can see death) is the same as those old japan tracks in the first DiRT. I also dont own a wheel and just left everything default, abs pffft, traction control... haha that what the accelerator is for, stability control? yeah i suppose i need that but honestly i like crashing so its off.","April 30, 2015","true","17.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I am running it in eyefinity 3x1 at a resolution of 5760x1080 on an FX8350/R9 290 on ultra settings and it runs extremely well, 50/60+fps with no AA, 40/50fps with AA on.\n\nThere's a lot of content too, 3 different countries with many different courses and a really nice selection of cars ranging from the 60's to present day.\n\nand the great part?

Been playing since 0.45 and have played all different classes except the 2010's. From the 1960's "beginner cars" to the Group B monsters, back down to Group A to the recent day this game is trying to confine 50 years of rallying in one single game. Car models are well done, physics are as good as you should (yes, should, not could) expect from a simulator game like this and the rally stage are close if not exact replica's of their real life counterparts, there's no fantasy involved.\n\nBut wait, there's more...\n\nDirt Rally also features the Pikes Peak Hillclimb and Rallycross now, which I find fun to do, but my main personal focus will stay on rally stages, but just know it's out there and it is fun. We'll see if Codemasters decides to expand on these championships with more different hillclimbs or rallycross circuits.\n\nOnto the lesser things, as the game is early access, which is sometimes - just like alpha or beta - misused to label an unfinished product that will stay unfinished, there are rough edges. However it feels genuinely early access, and not an excuse. One of things most notable are stuttering/lag issues that seem to affect Nvidia people more than AMD. No mouse support, which is weird for a 2015 game and obviously the "limited" (take it with a grain of salt) content available for the price of now 42 euro's (I bought it for 24 or something a few patches ago as they did mention it would increase in price overtime, which imo is a fresh attitude towards otherwhise buyable DLC's or patches).\nNow I'm not going to go into the discussion if 42 euro's is the correct price right now - although that is still less than let's say Project Cars or Assetto Corsa - as that depends on your budget and how hard you want this game, but I can say this game is worth playing...a lot.\n\nCause it's a sim, it'll take time before you get all green stage times and top the leaderboards, offline or online for that matter. And that's basically the real reason why I would advice this game, it's a longterm investment in entertainment, if Codemasters keeps up the patches like they do I can see this game being in the same league as Richard Burns Rally when it comes to lifespan.\n\nAnd that only means good news.\n\nSo, to Codemasters: please fix optimilization issues with graphics and sounds...and you have yourself a gold mine with an inspired and enthusiastic community.\n\nNectaria Coutayar","August 4, 2015","true","185.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In fact, only 1 time can I recall owning a checkpoint time during a run. Otherwise the AI destroys me. Championship mode is kicking my assp. Yes earning upgrades for the car to get better happens after each season regardless, and yes, tweaking the car is VERY feel good. Any road condition looks and feels great. Having a good team makes a world of difference. This is the Dirt game we AWD lovers have been waiting for. The tuning mechanics rock! However, never allowing me to win in any class against these impossible (to me) times is really pis annoying.\n\nI hope they tweak some of the AI times after the first checkpoint during a run.  Everytime I have green time and approach the first checkpoint QUICKLY that time evaporates and as my luck has it 80-90% of the time, I wreck shortly after. Even if I don't wreck I'm going from a +7 or +9 lead time to-20 or -30 trail time in mere seconds.\n\nRegardless, this is early access, so I can only hope that all this BS not placing 1st at all becomes a thing of the past, and the driving time I continue to put in actually pays off. I really love this game, and I believe Dirt Rally is one of the best driving game experiences I have had.\n\nTL:DR - Can't win a race after 17+ hours played, and I still recommend it. 10/10","July 8, 2015","true","32.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

(I love crashing the most XD). Sometimes it just wants to roll over and give the road a kiss, about 5 inches from your face Its just like car torturing simulator 2015 (make that next?) and I love every minute of it.\n\nThe accelerator also isnt a pedal its an adrenalin injector stuck in your arm that coincidently sets off a moderate engine backfire as your ♥♥♥ clenched after going 80km/h around that hairpin just next to that ♥♥♥♥ing large drop.\n\nPeople have asked 'Is this game too hard for me to play?' Maybe. I can play it with a controller that has a broken thumbstick and still finish a race; does that help? ( Here is me playing the original DiRT  Here is DiRT rally) If its too hard turn on the assists thats what they are there for :) I myself play automatic transmission because i just cant gear with a controller.\n\nIf I can give one piece of advice its to start off slowly at first and just try not to hit anything then try and drive smarter (racing line, drifing, accelerator control. Yes accelerator, line and braking is probably just as important to control as the wheel in cornering fast) to increase your times the custom race mode is good for practice as you can do any track with virtually any car and it doesnt cost you anything.\n\nGotta say ive played every dirt game so far and this is the one with the most challenging (and immersive) handling and sound. I think it got something back that was missing in dirt 2 and 3. The feeling of nailing a hairpin and sliding around it (you can see death) is the same as those old japan tracks in the first DiRT. I also dont own a wheel and just left everything default, abs pffft, traction control... haha that what the accelerator is for, stability control? yeah i suppose i need that but honestly i like crashing so its off.","April 30, 2015","true","17.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

A significant number of people seem to be comparing it the highly regarded Richard Burns Rally - which I played a fair bit of back in the day - and certainly seems to be of that ilk.\nIt punishes mistakes and rewarding consistency. This appears to have little in common with the DiRT titles that have gone before and, even these early access versions, is far superior to any of the WRC titles from BigBen.\n\nA limited but wondefully varied selection of stages to date, complimented by a fabulous selection of rally cars both young and old. The damage model is a particular highlight. I've consistently managed to suffer punctures - which are both visually rendered and affect handling - which with continued running results in blowouts and you running on the rim.\n\nIt's currently Early Access but I'm very optimistic.","May 7, 2015","true","366.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I am not good at controlling my car even with a gamepad, and god help any of you that try to play with just a mouse and keyboard.\n\nThat being said I think that this is a very very good game. The physics seem accurate (at least to a filthy casual such as myself), the tracks are supposed to be accurately modeled, and the sound, my god the audio is amazing. The gameplay is challenging, and unless you are much better than me you WILL destroy your car while learning it.\n\nOverall I'd say get this game if the idea of driving a howling turbocharged shitbox down gravel roads at 90mph while bouncing off berms appeals to you. I know it appeals to me.","November 28, 2015","true","6.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

In fact, only 1 time can I recall owning a checkpoint time during a run. Otherwise the AI destroys me. Championship mode is kicking my assp. Yes earning upgrades for the car to get better happens after each season regardless, and yes, tweaking the car is VERY feel good. Any road condition looks and feels great. Having a good team makes a world of difference. This is the Dirt game we AWD lovers have been waiting for. The tuning mechanics rock! However, never allowing me to win in any class against these impossible (to me) times is really pis annoying.\n\nI hope they tweak some of the AI times after the first checkpoint during a run.  Everytime I have green time and approach the first checkpoint QUICKLY that time evaporates and as my luck has it 80-90% of the time, I wreck shortly after. Even if I don't wreck I'm going from a +7 or +9 lead time to-20 or -30 trail time in mere seconds.\n\nRegardless, this is early access, so I can only hope that all this BS not placing 1st at all becomes a thing of the past, and the driving time I continue to put in actually pays off. I really love this game, and I believe Dirt Rally is one of the best driving game experiences I have had.\n\nTL:DR - Can't win a race after 17+ hours played, and I still recommend it. 10/10","July 8, 2015","true","32.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

The graphics are great , and audio is realistic too , each car has realistic engine sounds . This is a big problem in most racing games nowdays , however Codemasters seem to have got it spot on in the Dirt series , and you wont be dissapointed by this new addition to the family. New content gets released regurlarly , such as cars , new game modes and tracks. The most recent addition is the Rallycross update, which adds a few tracks and around 6 cars to tear up the track with, the most fun in this game mode probably would be online because of its fast paced nature , but is also amazing in singleplayer. Other game modes such as Hillclimb on Pikes Peak and Rally also are outstanding.There are many types of cars such as , 60s , 70s , 80 RWD, Group B , Group A , 2010s and more . Many fan favourites are in this game too (Lancia Delta Integrale , Audi Quattro rally and hillclimb , Lancia Stratos , S4 , Metro , Ford Fiesta ect)\n\nPros:\n-Realistic Physics\n-New Content Gets released regurlarly\n-Audio and Graphics spot on\n-Good selection of online events and competitions which happen on a daily basis with big prizes\n-Rallycross even has the Joker rule!!\n\nCons:\n-Some car classes do not have as much cars as others . (Early Access though.)\n\nFinal Verdict:\nThere is so much fun to be had in this great game , if you love motorsports definetley get this. However , may be challenging for newer players to the simulation racing genre.\n9/10 MUST BUY","August 30, 2015","true","38.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The realistic physics is challenging but all the more rewarding as you progress and begin to master it.  I did find it absolutely necessary to set steering sensitivity at 100%, as whatever the default setting had been was unplayable for me.  The graphics is great but not overly demanding.  In fact, it would be fully playable on even my small 13" gaming laptop if not for the only remaining negative point.  If you're running a laptop with nVidia Optimus switchable graphics (which is almost any current nVidia-powered gaming laptop,) you cannot run the game in fullscreen!  It simply refuses to comply, even if you edit the ini file.  Apparently this has been an initial issue with previous Dirt releases as well, which makes it all the more ridiculous that they let this one out with the same problem - and that it remains a problem with this title more than a year after initial public release!!  Note, AMD's switchable graphics is not afflicted with this problem but AMD only has roughly 25% marketshare among gamers.  Even so, I give the game five stars for being one of the few real shining stars in the PC driving game category.  I'm just glad I hung onto my older AMD-powered gaming laptop to play it!!","January 22","true","187.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The only reason I didn't recommend buying at that point was just that, it was Early Access and there wasn't a whole lot to do or see. Now that it's finally v1.0, I can safely say this is a must have for my fellow rally racing fans out there. Granted, I'm not a hardcore enthusiast whose past memories include the Colin McRae games or Richard Burns Rally, but I enjoyed the DiRT games despite them lying on the arcade side of the spectrum. This game is a much more realistic depiction of rally racing as opposed to the colorful, Gymkhana infested games of the series' past, and I love it. No longer can you take a corner at full speed and get away with it, or slam into the car ahead and deal with minor engine problems. Have I mentioned how gorgeous and well optimized this game is?

First I am a keyboard player, so i was a bit worried reading some reviews. I have been a keyboard player, since the early days of Colin McR Rally and i have also played the recent Dirt games, which have been disappointing due to a lack of focus on pure Rally. This game ticks all the boxes! its a pure rally game, back to the good old days of Colin McR.\nI have been playing for a couple of hours now, I am not ashamed to say the first attempt did not go well ........ the mini did not even see half way through stage one. That when old senses came back of i need to protect the car and listen to pace note (something very noval for a Dirt Game!). I started to do that and it has started to come together. This game is hard, you really have to listen and feel the road. I have still not got completed a stage where i have not have moment of out braking myself or going a bit wide, that what keep me coming back for more, i want to finally nail a stage. I nearly did 10 mins ago, but on the final corner i slide wide and caught a tree............. so close yet so far.\nIn regards to the keyboard, its fine, its like a rally games back in the 2000's, you just have to have a bit of skill and not drive like an idiot (or like in other Dirt games!)","May 1, 2015","true","5.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hallowenman/recommended/310560/","hallowenman","Hallowenman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hallowenman/","150 products in account","Looking for a realistic rally game? Buy DiRT Rally, a truly great rally sim!\n\nThis game is difficult, and I would personally say that if you do not have a decent wheel, do not buy this game, as it is so much fun with a wheel and you wouldn't drive a real rally car with a keyboard, would you? If you don't want to get a wheel, then... get a more arcade rally game I guess, like the older DiRT games.\n\n||| What does this game do well?\n\n+ Handling: It is difficult to drive fast in this game without messing your run up, or without crashing. You need to spend some time getting used to driving a rally car in this game. This is not an arcade rally game unlike the other DiRT games. When you finally get the hang of it, then its a whole new world. The feeling of getting through a corner sideways, and fast, in a rally car without hitting something and without losing control: its so amazing, but kinda difficult (depending on car and surface). But is all the hours of practice worth it in the end? Yes, no doubt!\n\n+ Cars: Good selection of cars, and they feel different. Really feels like they have put some time into each car. Sound are also very nice.\n\n+ Stages: Some say they are a bit too wide, which makes it easier to drive fast as you got more room to mess it up in, instead of just going straight into a tree, but those are mostly people that are really good at the game and that can drive extremely fast and controlled. Trust me, this game will challenge you.\n\n+ Realism: Each stage/track has different surfaces, and you will feel a difference. Its for example more than one type of gravel, and in Finland I personally (with the cars I have driven there) feel that I got more grip and more control of the car, but if I try the Welsh stages I feel like its a lot easier to go sideways and lose control of the car.\n\n+ Enviroment: Night stages, rain and snow makes the stages very fun.\n\n+ Different types of rally: You got more than just "classic rally" (rally stages), you can also drive Rallycross which is laps on short tracks with mixed surface and it includes the event structure (heats, semi-finals and finals). So you can learn the tracks as there isnt that many corners and be really fast. You also got hillclimb with the famous Pikes Peak which is really fun and difficult.\n\n||| What could be improved?\n\n- Stages: More stages would make it a lot more fun. If you play the career mode you will basically go through the same stages over and over again, just in different cars, so its easy to get a little bit tired after many, many hours into the game, but the different cars makes the stages interesting, so you'll probably keep playing if you like rally driving. And as mentioned, night versions of the stages and snow/rain will give you variations.\n\n- Making the game run better, optimizing: I will admit that I am using an older GPU, so I understand that I can't play the game at max graphic settings, but the long stages really needs more optimizing if that is possible with the game engine. With my current settings I get steady FPS and nice visuals at the sprint stages and the long stages, but Pikes Peak, which is really long, really struggles. But it is a game by Codemasters, so what did you expect?  The game will run very well on more recent GPU's, so if you got a good GPU from the Nvidia 600-series or newer you should be able to play it at medium/high graphic settings and get a good and steady FPS. Always make sure to keep your drivers up to date!\nEdit: I am now using a new PC and the game runs fine. My old PC was low-end (Nvidia GTX 550 Ti 1 Gb) and around 5 years old, so most people will probably have no problems running this.\n\n- Force Feedback: The FFB is far from bad, but just like other Codemaster racing games the FFB isn't as good as I would like it to be in a sim. Its good enough to give me feedback about what the car is doing, how it is responding to the surface, but I think it needs some improving.\nEdit: I am not using a expensive wheel that has impressive FFB, but my wheel is far from bad. I have not researched this a lot, but as far as I know the wheel I am using is using a more simple design to deliver the force feedback, so DiRT Rally might not be optimized for this kind of wheel. I am using a Logitech DFGT. But just to repeat it: the FFB is NOT bad, but I would like to see some improvements.\n\nEDIT 08/4/2016: Codemasters really cares about this game. Continues updates adding new content and fixing bugs are amazing. A few days ago lots of new cars were added for free, thanks Codemasters!\n\n||| Overall score: This is a really fun rally sim, yes I'm calling it a sim even though some claim it is not a sim.It gives you plenty of challenges. Would like to see some improvements, but at the time of writing this review it is pretty good. 9/10","December 19, 2015","true","42.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Game sits more on the sim side of things, especially compared to previous Dirt titles. Focus this time around (as evidanced by the title) is Rally, however there is also Hillclimb, and Rallycross available.\n\nDo not buy this if you do not have a controller or wheel, you'll have a hard time using a keyboard.\n\nA note on the stages: not counting Hillclimb and Rallycross, there's 6 locales with 12 stages each, each locale uses 6, two long (~10KM) stages, each cut in half to make 6, each with a reverse run for 12 total. Stages average between 2:30 and 8:30 to run, depending on skill, length, and class of car.\n\nHillclimb features Pikes Peak, both fully paved and mixed surface, and you can run it in sectors, or the entire course in one go.\n\nRallycross is licensed, and features 3 locales with multiple layouts for each.\n\nCar classes and numbers are:\n2 60's FWD cars\n4 70's RWD cars\n2 80's RWD cars\n2 Group B RWD cars\n5 Group B 4WD cars\n3 Group A 4WD cars\n2 F2 Kit Car FWD cars\n4 2000's 4WD Cars\n2 R4 4WD cars\n4 2010's 4WD cars\n3 4WD Hillclimb cars\n6 Rallycross Super cars\n\nAt the end of the day, if you like sim/sim-ish (depending on who you ask) physics, and previous Dirt titles left you wanting more in the way of rally, then this is your game. If you like Gymkahana and other such spetacle, or want an arcadey racing game, look elsewhere (Dirt 3 for example).","July 3, 2015","true","205.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've raced a lot in real life and with racing sims/wheels. The physics do feel a little off so I wouldn't consider it a complete sim but it's definitely one of the best that's come out recently. It starts you off relitvely simple with a front wheel drive 60's rally car. It's a great learning car and really helps to earn you the money to get the stronger cars with different drive terrains. I really enjoyed the tuning on the cars as well. It took me a while to be able to confidently tune my car and with each new car comes a new tune to learn. The game helps simplify this a little by offering a simple tuning page and a complex one. I highly seguest this game with both a controller and a wheel. I've enjoyed the game so far doing both. Expect to crash a lot and not come in first for a while if this is your first rally game.

But, I can only recommend this to people who are seriously into simulation racing games, and also understand the challenge of rally racing compared to a normal race track. Just because you're good at a game like Forza on a controller, or you did well playing the rally tracks on DiRT 3, doesn't mean you'll be good at this, and here is a few reasons why.\n\nI've been playing DiRT Rally for two hours, and I haven't had the chance to finish a full championship yet. This is due to resetting my progress after two races out of the four in the starting championship, because I was doing so terribly. Even if I have a race where I haven't crashed once and I think I'm doing okay, I'm losing by 30 seconds at the end. Because there's no options on how difficult your opponents are like a lot of racing games have.\n\nAnother thing is that you need to pay lots of attention to your assistant who tells you what turns and bumps are coming up. And if you think you can just stick to a driving line, too bad. There is NO option for a driving line in this game, even for braking only, and that bugs me.\n\nThe car settings are a lot more complex compared to your usual driving sim, and actually plays an important role in how your car handles the extreme conditions. You can play other racing simulations and stick to the default car settings and probably be fine, but if you don't understand the settings much in this and don't have the patience to test stuff and learn how it all works, this game might not be for you.\n\nAnd lastly, if you're one of those players who like to restart an unlimited amount of times just until you get it right, you won't have fun with this. Championship series' in DiRT Rally, or the first championship available to play atleast, only allows 5 restarts over the four races. And you're more than likely going to mess up badly and want to restart, otherwise you'll have to "recover" your car and put up with being severely time penalised.\n\nIf you have the patience to play the first championship over and over again and continue losing, maybe you'll earn up enough experience points and money to race some cars that you'll like better and have a better crew for car settings, then you can have a go at some different championship tournaments. But if you're not good at rally games and what I've written above applies to you, you'll probably be stuck on the same thing for longer than you can tolerate.\n\nBig ups to Codemasters for creating an insanely challenging rally game, and thankyou for scrapping the dudebro loser voice that makes DiRT 3 and GRID 2 hard to tolerate.","March 25","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(note by civilized world I would like to stress; the market/s.)\n\nYes this is opinionated but honest and unbiased recommendation but that's not the point, it being; that this game is immensely good (involved and evolved) in terms of various aspects that have to do with gaming and then namely in the Rallyesim (sub)genre.\n\n-It is just as much fun as the Dirt series was, which by all means could be considered an arcade-"sim" (more 'arcarde' then 'sim' IMHO),\n-It is just as easy to drive (like say... Richard Burns Rally) respectfully,\n-with a somewhat strong emphasis on real simulation this one takes the cake, for sure.\n-As it is the newest addition in the hereford mentioned category it has a lot to offer, with the newest, most recent rendition above all (if you care for your games looks, this is your pick).\n-(but;) Most importantly the racing, gaming experience is right on point, and could be possibly (I think) considered true to (real) life physics, from what I can feel 'driving'.\n\nThis is what a lot of people, from what I could gather have been hoping for, expecting and waiting for (including yourz truly) hence now is the time for it to be delivered; see here and look no further. I think that someone who isn't involved with Rally Racing would, after seeing this game in action get hooked and would want to jump right in. I got it in Early Access and this is to me proof of (that) concept; it's great but remember: Skill takes a lot of practice and mastery equals dedication.\n\nMight you choose to pick this one up; Enjoy!!

Just get the game if you want something to truly remind of the essence of Rally ported into a videogame. I bought this on early access and didn't regret it one bit. Want to get that full immersion? Just disable HUD completely and listen only to co-drivers calls. Add to that the authentic feel of the cars and you'll find yoursefl putting in those hours without even noticing it.","December 8, 2015","true","91.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Codemaster took out all of the handicaps that were in dirt 3 and made the handling of the vehicles more realistic, but diffucult at the same time. As of right now (May 2015), its still in early access and only has about 16-17 vehicles, but they vary across many different specs ranging from a 1960's mini cooper to a modified Fiesta and  Impreza. Normally i would have been disapointed with such a small selection of cars, but each one has thier own unique feel to them which makes the harder to learn and thus more time is required with each car. Overall, I believe that if you are a fan of the dirt or rally series, and you can managae to take a beating, id get this game. Knowing Codemasters, they arent going to drop this game in the middle of development like other developers have.","May 4, 2015","true","23.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The settings I'm now using feels great though.\nIn my opinion there is not too much grip. Although I have never driven a real rally car, I would say the grip and the driving physics in this game are something I would believe to be realistic.\n\nBy far the best rally game I have had (incl. RBR).\n\n+ Physics\n+ Graphics\n+ Restart costs money (career) and can be set off in online leagues, and there are no "flashbacks"\n+ Online leagues\n+ Online events\n\nSince it's an early access I don't list all negative points (like too few cars and tracks), I'm sure they will be included in the final release. But there are some features I wish to be in the release version:\n\n- Save/edit/share replay videos\n- Online rallycross (with rules that prevent it to turn into a demolition derby)\n- Option to choose if the steering wheel is on the right or left hand side of the car.\n- More precise FOV settings\n- Some improvements needed to UI usability\n\nI would recommend this game to any rally fan.","May 19, 2015","true","155.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Information overload at times but I love it!\n+ Sounds are brilliant, though need adjusting to here the co-driver properly.\n+ Stages are of good length and decent variety. It's great having longer stages, finally and also Pikes Peak.\n+ Great controller support. I've been able to fine tune my G27 to how I like it to be.\n+ Great variety of cars (Group B, Group A, WRC spec and more).\n+ You can turn the entire HUD off so it's just you, your co-driver and the road.\n+ Addition of hill climb is another dimension to the game.\n\n- Need a button to turn lights on/off.\n- Cut scenes before the start of the stage I feel are needed. You press continue and you're at the lights if you're ready or not. No time to take a breath before you go.\n- Pacenotes at times on 'Normal' setting come up too late, meaning you're into the corner your co-driver is describing.\n\nOverall, an absolute wonderful game to date. I've never finished a rally game before where I've slapped the wheel with joy after driving through a stage. This game just brings utter joy and will do to anyone who likes racing and/or rallying.","June 21, 2015","true","18.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

DiRT Rally has the essence of what matters the most in rally - trying not to lose control of the car, squeeze into every narrow corner to beat it as fast as possible and also it gives us a large dose of emotions. As we know, fractions of seconds are very significant in rally, and sometimes you can make one little wrong move and it can affect on your final score, so it's necessary to stay focused to the end of the track if you want to end with a decent results. It's certainly not a game for casuals, it requires some skills and basic knowledge about rally from you, it's not some Need for Speed where you can easily drive over 200mph and easily squeeze into every corner without making any efforts. If you're looking for challenging and demanding game, it's definitely for you. Don't give up quickly, it usually takes even 10 hours to learn the basics. If you can complete a single track without crashing your car (without driving assistance) - it's good. And one more thing, this game desperately needs a good steering wheel, without it it's impossible to feel the physics model and the satisfaction from driving. I personally recommend good old logitech G27. It's not cheap, but it's definitely worth your money anyway.

Of course, the former is laughable by any measure nowadays, and I can only wonder if we'll laugh at today's racing games 30 years from now pondering how we found a title to be quite this amazing.\n\nDirt Rally has an incredibly replayable, difficult, and addictive nature to it.  I will find myself playing "just one more stage" again and again, and it has become my go-to game.  I highly recommend a controller (or driving controls...just not a keyboard/mouse) as the analog inputs are very much needed.  Dirt Rally is much more a simulation and a challenging one, which makes the realism seem much higher than your typical driving game.\n\nIt has three modes currently--rally (my favorite), hill climb, and a circuit against other vehicles (ai or pvp).  Each is unique and takes time to master.  I have yet to master the latter even at a basic level.  Additionally, there are daily, weekly, monthly, and league challenges in addition to 5 difficulty levels (of which I have seen just two in 60+ hours of gameplay).\n\nI cannot recommend this game highly enough!!  The best part is that since they are still in early access, they continue adding new features, tracks, and cars, while fine-tuning what they already have.","August 12, 2015","true","257.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(note by civilized world I would like to stress; the market/s.)\n\nYes this is opinionated but honest and unbiased recommendation but that's not the point, it being; that this game is immensely good (involved and evolved) in terms of various aspects that have to do with gaming and then namely in the Rallyesim (sub)genre.\n\n-It is just as much fun as the Dirt series was, which by all means could be considered an arcade-"sim" (more 'arcarde' then 'sim' IMHO),\n-It is just as easy to drive (like say... Richard Burns Rally) respectfully,\n-with a somewhat strong emphasis on real simulation this one takes the cake, for sure.\n-As it is the newest addition in the hereford mentioned category it has a lot to offer, with the newest, most recent rendition above all (if you care for your games looks, this is your pick).\n-(but;) Most importantly the racing, gaming experience is right on point, and could be possibly (I think) considered true to (real) life physics, from what I can feel 'driving'.\n\nThis is what a lot of people, from what I could gather have been hoping for, expecting and waiting for (including yourz truly) hence now is the time for it to be delivered; see here and look no further. I think that someone who isn't involved with Rally Racing would, after seeing this game in action get hooked and would want to jump right in. I got it in Early Access and this is to me proof of (that) concept; it's great but remember: Skill takes a lot of practice and mastery equals dedication.\n\nMight you choose to pick this one up; Enjoy!! I love it, and now time for me to jump back in myself.\n\nPeace!\n(ps kudos@Devs, I think deservingly so.

But, I can only recommend this to people who are seriously into simulation racing games, and also understand the challenge of rally racing compared to a normal race track. Just because you're good at a game like Forza on a controller, or you did well playing the rally tracks on DiRT 3, doesn't mean you'll be good at this, and here is a few reasons why.\n\nI've been playing DiRT Rally for two hours, and I haven't had the chance to finish a full championship yet. This is due to resetting my progress after two races out of the four in the starting championship, because I was doing so terribly. Even if I have a race where I haven't crashed once and I think I'm doing okay, I'm losing by 30 seconds at the end. Because there's no options on how difficult your opponents are like a lot of racing games have.\n\nAnother thing is that you need to pay lots of attention to your assistant who tells you what turns and bumps are coming up. And if you think you can just stick to a driving line, too bad. There is NO option for a driving line in this game, even for braking only, and that bugs me.\n\nThe car settings are a lot more complex compared to your usual driving sim, and actually plays an important role in how your car handles the extreme conditions. You can play other racing simulations and stick to the default car settings and probably be fine, but if you don't understand the settings much in this and don't have the patience to test stuff and learn how it all works, this game might not be for you.\n\nAnd lastly, if you're one of those players who like to restart an unlimited amount of times just until you get it right, you won't have fun with this. Championship series' in DiRT Rally, or the first championship available to play atleast, only allows 5 restarts over the four races. And you're more than likely going to mess up badly and want to restart, otherwise you'll have to "recover" your car and put up with being severely time penalised.\n\nIf you have the patience to play the first championship over and over again and continue losing, maybe you'll earn up enough experience points and money to race some cars that you'll like better and have a better crew for car settings, then you can have a go at some different championship tournaments. But if you're not good at rally games and what I've written above applies to you, you'll probably be stuck on the same thing for longer than you can tolerate.\n\nBig ups to Codemasters for creating an insanely challenging rally game, and thankyou for scrapping the dudebro loser voice that makes DiRT 3 and GRID 2 hard to tolerate.","March 25","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you wonderting DR is worth buying or not, this one would never let you down.\n\nGraphics do not seem to be best one around, but it is satisfying.\n\nFeels of driving, It's just solid, you can feel and imagine car's mass and how tyres are working.  Might be difficult for begginers of whole kinds of racing game, could be challenging. Unlike hardcore sims such as Assetto Corsa and rFactor2, cars of DR are much more manageable and still provides us with thrills when you push it to the limit. Sometimes it feels too quick to settle mass movement of cars but still fun.\n\nContents: DR has several game modes not only ordinary rally(needless to say, it is great) but pikes peak and rally cross. To be honest, my personal Opinion on RX is not so fun but Pikes peak is much more fun and enjoyable. I want codies to add another stages of pikes peak and its cars.\n\nAs you know, every game has cons, DR is not an exception even if those cons are minor ones.\nAt first, DR lacks bits of online features and Credit earning and upgradeing cars are sometimes boaring.(But still better than games that have car editing system)\nAlso lacks Ghost car(replay) feature,  sometimes pacenote goes wrong and no way to correct it.\n\nI don't know if anyone have read through this text but I hugely appriciate you guys and Codies' hard work!

Car handling will take a lot of getting used to if you are only used to Dirt, and even if not they still take a lot of concentration and planning ahead to drive them fast and not wreck horribly.\n\nThe sound is top notch. What I was most surprised by was how good the video performance is. You can tell it has been optimised very well for PC. My system isn't exactly new by any means [Phenom II 940 @ 3.5GHz, Radeon 6970 @ 950MHz, 16GB RAM], yet I can run it comfortably with almost everything on Ultra settings @ 1080p. Framerate is around 60fps most of the time, and drops no lower than 40's from time to time. Very impressed!\n\nOverall, it's a pure rally game. All of the time and effort has gone into the rally experience, and it really shows. Would recommend if you are looking for a more hardcore rallying game.\n\nI will say to take some time to play around with the controls, however. In particular, when I started playing I felt a real disconnect between my control inputs [gamepad] and the car. What I found to be the cause was the 'Linearity' option under advanced gamepad options. Setting it to 100% fixed it right up, mapping my steering input 1:1 with the actual steering input.","April 29, 2015","true","9.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Modded stages and cars are what kept RBR alive, and I feel that it will keep this alive longer too if it's added.\n\nAlso, the Flying Finland update is the most fun I've had in ages. Yes, the stages are slightly incorrect in parts (the jumps are too much IMO, either they got the jumps/bumps/crests themselves wrong or the car weight needs to be adjusted), but it's still great fun. 10/10, can't wait for the Modern Masters release!","October 7, 2015","true","60.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Man, hitting a corner at perfect speed in the perfect angle feels so rewarding and makes you forget the\nnumerous of crashes you had in that corner to get it right. But don't loose your cool because the next set of turns are just\nas important :-)\n\nThe ammount of cars is more than okay. And in the midst of all of them are some really iconic rally cars. Plus cars get added\nover time so not much to complain about that. And you dont swap cars every race as you really need to get a feel for the car\nyou plan on driving.\nAnd with the cars comes great finetuning. with explanation for those who dont know all to much about the in depth jitter jatter\nof cartuning.\n\nIt's nothing more then a racing gaming in its purest form.

Usually, my desire to collect and upgrade cars is what drives me to continue playing games like Gran Turismo, or Forza, because racing in those games can be downright boring. Not so in Dirt Rally, with which I am obsessed right now. I usually don't get infatuated with a game unless it is RPG in nature, but this game has got me hooked.The racing really gives you a feel of power because the cars feel and sound amazing, and the amount of challenge means that success is extremely rewarding. Successfully drifting through a hairpin turn gives a great feeling. Another reviewer said that this is the Dark Souls of racing, and I wholeheartedly agree. Prepare to die, a lot.

They are however really immersive.\n- When you simply want to beat your time, and just get a kick out of being able to complete a stage without crashing, you know they've done something really wonderful.\n- The sound is jaw-dropping - you hear everything\n- The pace-notes add so much to the game; tone changes as you speed up or go over bumps - it's so immersive\n- For an Early Access game, I cannot believe how polished it is.\n- Codemasters have a roadmap for this game, and if you invest now, you'll receive all the updates free - AWESOME!\n\nWhat were Negatives (have been fixed now)\n- Force feedback - It's so much better now; it feels great - in fact...\n* AC is good, but this is just as good now\n- Support for my Thrustmaster gear stick - This is supported now\n- No support for a clutch - This is supported now\n\nNow I don't have any negative comments. Simply one of the best Racing games EVER! The best rally game for sure.","May 3, 2015","true","28.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Things are only made more difficult when you consider the kind of simulator DiRT Rally is aiming to be - a rally simulator.\n\nThe rallying community, both virtually and in the real world, are some of the most difficult-to-please, hardcore audience on the face of the planet. Whereas ALMS, F1, and NASCAR fans line purpose-built race courses, or well-refined street circuits for a couple hours, with countless food stalls and creature comforts at each turn; rally fans stand in dark Finnish forests, in the dead of night, in the rain and mud, for hours at a time, only for a brief 5-second glimpse of action.\n\nTrue dedication, and because of that; this audience is most critical of any rally simulator. You either get it right, or the community will tear you to shreds - like what the community has done with the last few DiRT games.\n\nThis time, though, with Dirt Rally... things are quite a bit different. Codemasters have gone to the community, and asked for help. They've done their homework, and they're no longer taking direction from a middle-aged dudebruh who got famous for doing donuts in parking lots in a brightly-painted Subaru.\n\nThis game is brutal. The stages (although a tad short compared to their real-life counterparts) are punishing, with absurdly narrow roads, jumps, dips, blind crests, surface changes, water splashes, and lots, lots more. The AI (although you never see them, apart from in Rallycross), are brutal, and they pose a challenge even for an extremely well-seasoned simulation racing enthusiast, such as myself. Then there's the car damage, which is quite simply the most realistic in any racing game, period.\n\nThis is the Dark Souls of the racing world. If you're into simulation racing games that will test you to your breaking point; this is for you. You will feel like Walter Rohrl when playing this game, as you charge through Finnish forests in a 500 horsepower, fire-breathing Audi Sport Quattro - and that's the highest praise I can dish out.\n\nPros:\n\nExcellent sound design,\nExcellent level/course/stage design,\nGorgeous graphics,\nExcellent physics,\nLots of replay value,\n\nCons:\n\nOnline limited to only Rallycross and Timetrials,\nNot enough content,\n\nNeutrals:\n\nCar list, although good, isn't huge and is lacking some must-have cars.\n\nRating: 9/10, Must-Own (For all sim racing enthusiasts.)","October 25, 2015","true","62.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There's two to three routes in each country with a few variations. However, the driving alone has this amazing combination of challenge and fun. Also, the sound design is some of the best I've heard.\n\nAfter Grid 2, I thought Codies lost their touch, but Dirt Rally has proved me wrong.

A volume control for this would be nice.

This is a video game.  If it's not fun...they will not come. E-brake needs lots of work (unpredictable,inconsistent) and it seems like the width of the roads are not proportional to the size of the vehicle. This must be correct before any physics model will work ...i would think.  Otherwise the game seems pretty good. Is this dirt 4 with a new name or can we still look forward to a dirt 4 release??

R.I.P. He would be PROUD of this game.\n\nCodemasters asked, "What do people want to see in the next DiRT game?"  I said, "RALLY.  Strictly rally.  Stages.  Repair.  Heavy cars and damage that makes me want to cry."\n\nThey delivered everything I could ask for.  I even said, maye consider Hillclimbs.  And what do i see on the main menu...  "HILLCLIMBS coming soon."    They really listen to their fans.\n\nBEAUTIFUL expanses of trees like no other game.  Day Rain, Night Rain.  Reverse. (so many variations)  DAMAGE that you KNOW you'll pay for in later stages.  Possibly lose a tire and still try to get to the finish line.  I love it.  NO REWIND.  You can restart for a cost.

No matter what car or track you choose it's a challenge just to get through the race without crashing. I don't know whether it's realistic as a simulator or not but it seems like it could be for the most part. I've only played with an xbox controller so far and it feels great. I recommend driving manual and utilizing the handbreak turning as it adds a lot to the experience. Once you start getting good enough to actually finish a race it becomes a real rush trying to improve your times because of the thin and bumpy tracks. If you lose focus for half a second you'll soon find yourself upside down in a ditch with a missing tire and a cracked windshield.\n\n+ Immersion (incredibly good sound, nice graphics, physics seems reasonably real).\n+ Challenge (You need to be awake while hurtling a 2000 pound machine down a bumpy forrest trail at 80 MPH).\n+ Early acces (The game will improve over time).\n\n- fov settings limited, had to edit the config file to get it right with triple monitor setup.\n- Although I've not experienced this my self as I have no wheel, some people have reported poor ffb with theirs. But I believe they will address this issue.\n\nStrongly recommed.","May 10, 2015","true","142.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't believe codemasters when they said their next title would actually be focused on true rally. Turns out I was wrong.\n\n\nCurrently, I would like to see a few fairly minor tweaks to a few aspects of the physics model, a little more aggressive damage and some FFB tweaks (manually editing the config file really improved things to the point that I'm happy with the current state).\n\nCodemasters has been very receptive to customer feedback and appear to be working on all these points.\n\nAs it stands, I would not be disappointed with exactly what I have received, even if we weren't going to get any futher updates. I think there's strong potential for an RBR replacement here.\n\nGraphics, performance, stability... All very acceptable at 2160p native.\n\nGood work, codemasters.

The reason why I say this is because the other Code Master games I have played, such as the DiRT games have been far far easier than this game. This game is an actual simulation, not a racing game that is going to walk you through every aspect of its mechanics. Instead it dumps you on your face where you will fail time and time again until you start to understand the mechanics, or are used to rally car physic type stuff (or you destroy your keyboard/controller because you can't stay on the ♥♥♥♥ing track). In my opinion Code Masters took a very good turn as far as game types, and I think they should continue down this path. I definately reccomend this game if you are ready for a challenge, but overall this is a very, very rewarding game when you nail the physics of it and get that satisfying pay off.","May 7, 2015","true","62.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game feels unforgiving at first but patience and practice begin to pay off after just a couple of hours.\n\nThe game is a superb blitz through Wales/Greece/Monte Carlo (at the moment) with Rally car through the ages. It's early access and more stages and hillclimbs are to come but there different styles and eras of cars keep you on your toes.\n\nOne thing to do for sure is to make use of the shakedowns where possible to fine tune the set up of your car and understand the feel of the surface.\n\nI have been using Xbox controller for windows and have found this to be pretty decent although I imagine a wheel and pedal set up would give such a better feel.\n\nAlthough early access this is already shaping up to be a classic and one of the best Rally games ever.

Never thought I would be so happy about getting 2nd place in a championship race. As I raced across the gravel kicking it up rocks and dirt at high speeds and cornering faster than I should of with a few love taps to the edges of death on the gravel/dirt roads, I managed to hold on with my pal Dave in the passenger seat. Me and Dave met at a party about 4 months ago and as soon as we glazed at one another we immediately knew we were meant for greatness. at first it was sorta ruff and couldn't catch a break, but that all changed on this day when everything would go right. We were both sweating in fear and adrenaline as we drifted on the narrow corners with our rear tires right on the edge of the cliff knowing if we fell off, it would be our deaths. The time was on the rise but we were doing good as we came to the final stretch we were overpowered by excitement of the finish line that we were going even faster which cause us to fishtail a little, but due to our tremendous love for one another and the road, the fishtail was no match for us and once we passed the finish line we glazed into each others lovely eyes and began to hug each other like it was our last.\n\nAnd this is the story about how I was able to please the great gods of Asgoth!","May 7, 2015","true","83.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"We will never recoup our costs" they might say.\n\nReleasing as early access they solved this politic issue and prolly got money when they needed it the most - for bug cleaning and tweaking.\n\nLoving it so far. Handling is superb imho. Lots of adjustments can be made but you can also turn on some assists if you need that as well. Nice balance there. The graphics are beautiful on Ultra; wish I had 3 monitors and a wheel.\n\nSo happy the DIRT series didnt die and they went this route for the niche hardcores!\n\nIf you love rally support the developers and buy this game you won't be disappointed.","May 3, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are not mind blowing but still very good, when you see the dust a few hundred meters behind you or the water splash driving through the muddy Wales. The Sound is amazing especially the historic cars sound like beasts. Sitting at the start with the Audi Quattro and the Stratos or the newly added Hillclimb cars, it's just an epic feeling listening to that monster sound. The Stages feel like real Rally stages and look quite similar to the real-life models. The handling feels alright, even tho it can still be twitched a bit along with the FFB.\n\nEven tho it says Early Access, DiRT Rally feels more like a finished game that hasn't too much content at the moment. But there is a lot of content to come, next month there will be a German rally stage that puts you on a full tarmac course, and then later the summer Codemasters will add the biggest action motorsports has to show, with rallycross, to the game. Along with other content (also cars), there's no doubt that this can be the greatest rally game since and for a long time.\n\n"If in doubt, flat out" - Colin McRea ;)","May 27, 2015","true","219.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Has a great car lineup (with more to come), and all of them true classic rally vehicles. There are 36 stages so far with plenty of stages clocking in at 5+ minutes across Greece, UK/Wales and Monte Carlo. I'll be honest that I've spent most of my time playing the British rally, it's just such a nostaglia rush to have a Ford Escort RS Coswoth or Subaru Impreza blasting along the Sweetlamb stage. I started playing rally videogames with the DOS-based Network Q RAC Rallly Championship game from 1996, and getting to race these 90's Group A cars across Wales is a blast from the past!\n\nAnyway, if you're a rally fan (particularly of the UK rally) then I would definitely give this game a look in. It's a difficult yet exciting take on the sport and a return to a more traditional rally game for the Dirt series which is very postivte I think.

Through the butt-clenching hairpin turns on a track barely wider than your car, or the long stretches of track with trees on one side and a cliff edge on the other truly make rally racing an unique discipline. When Colin McRae's DiRT landed I was thrilled. A bit arcade-y, but it was an extremely fun game and was chock full of rallying goodies.  Unfortunately, the series took a downward spiral of depression, and started gaining unnecessary weight through the use of Ken Block, gymkhana, and developed diabetes from a general "Dude-bro" attitude to the sport.\n\nThankfully, Codemasters released DiRT Rally. DiRT Rally cuts off all that extra and unnecessary weight, and throws everything wrong with DiRT 2, DiRT 3 and DiRT Showdown out the window and focuses on pure rallying with no extra B.S.\n\nIf you want Gymkhana, Ken Block, Explosions, Fireworks, Rewinds, then this game is not for you.\n\nIf you want just rallying; rallying in it's purest form from the likes that we haven't seen since the glory days of Richard Burn's Rally, then I think you will enjoy this game.\n\nWhile I wouldn't say DiRT Rally is the be-all-end-all of simulation Rally (I'd say it's more Simcade) it's still a very thought out game. It is by no means at all easy to drive these beasts on the gravel. You WILL crash. A lot.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind, the game is Early Access. There IS a chance that the game will fail to deliver. However, it seems Codemasters has a very good, thorough plan set for the next couple of months (Pikes Peak and Rallycross soon!)\n\nBut the game is already fleshed out pretty well, with a championship mode and an interesting multiplayer function called "Leagues" where friends can race against each other to set the best times in multiple events.\n\nHere's hoping Codemasters stays faithful to the old fans of rallying.  I look forward to seeing what comes of DiRT Rally in the future.","May 4, 2015","true","64.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was excited that the there was a new DiRT game coming out and that it was going to be focused on rally however I was also scared that it wouldn’t live up to my expectations. I finally made the decision to buy it and I was so happy to make that decision. It is the most fun early access game I have played since kerbal space program. Another worry I had about this game was that it would be unplayable with a controller but that is not true. The game is perfectly playable with a controller, however every day I own this game the temptation to buy a force feedback wheel grows. I love how this game feels and the way the can completely upset the cars balance. Although there aren’t that many cars and stages yet they are all high quality and there will be more to come in future updates.\nAll is not well though, as with all of these positives there must be some negatives. Most of the things that I have disliked about this game are all the symptoms of an early access release and most of them have been fixed or will be fixed. The bugs I have experienced with this game have been mostly Co-driver related and they are all fixed quickly by the next update.\nIn the end I am very happy I have bought this game as not only has it been fun but it has been a learning curve, helping me progress my ability. I can’t wait to see what this game will become in the future.\n\n9/10 would buy again.\n","May 30, 2015","true","173.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Got it as a part of an AMD promotion and already fell in love with it. Setting up a crew and progressing through the game feels particularly rewarding, and the handling on the car feels pretty natural, even on a gamepad.\n\nMy favorite part however is that the upgrades aren't linear, which is a problem that plagues racing sims. If a racing game allows customization at all, it usually follows that there is a certain set of upgrades one should get to optimize their car, and that's it. With vehicle progression being based on the crew you choose, I can see myself dumping hours into this game to see how different crews work out for different cars.\n\nMay not have invested to much time into the game, but I love racing games and this already seems like a blast.

The series took a step away from simulation with DiRT 2, using a more arcade-y physics package, gimmicky races and locations, and tacky cameos from Pastrana and Block. DiRT 3 and Showdown...more of the same, if not even worse.\n\nFinally, Codemasters brings us back to the glory days, giving us a rally game worth playing. No nonsense, unforgiving (to a fault at points, and yes, Wales, I'm speaking of you), visually impressive, and just plain fun.

Fantastic rally game with the learning curve of actually trying to race a real event (haven't really done it but can assume I'd end up wrapped around a tree at the first turn). Seriously don't expect to pick this up and be a pro first run, but given time, this game will have you feeling more than ready to go hit some back roads at 90mph. I bought a T300 and playseat challenge as soon as I saw this was out and will never look back. I couldn't imagine playing this with a controller but I see people do and post better times than me so it's definitely possible.\nTips: start slow enough to consistently finish stages without wrecking and slowly, very slowly watch your times increase. I've spent 20 hours with this game and just now got second in my first career open rally series. I can't stop playing. Too good. All time favorite racing game. Period.\nRally racing at its finest in such a long time it's almost as if this is the only rally game that's ever existed.

There are many Pro's and COn's to this game and i think they deserve to be fairly listed.\n\nPro's\n+No Ken Block, no drift events, no annoying announcers\n+Probably the best Rally sim out since RBR\n+ Gorgeous Tracks\n+Beautifully Detailed Cars\n+ Realistic Car Handling and FFB (Especially with a wheel)\n+ Choice and Category of Cars\nThe overall feel of the cars and the tracks alone make this game worth playing.\n\nCons\n-Unforgiving racing simulator (Not full Sim but not very far off either. Firmly in 80% + sim territory)\nNote the Above is a drawback for those not into Sim's\n-In game Economy mode needs work, new players are excluded from so much without doing SIngle Event\n-Immersion is ruined by botched physics and object interaction. This is when you hit something in the game. Mud is basicaly ice and can rol you at 15MPH no matter what car you are in... wodden signs that if you hit stick to you and you cant go faster than 40 MPH, tire damage that is cringe inducing, in certain cars simply spinning out and bumping a tree with your rear means a flat. Maybe 2.\n-The selection of Cars, most of the classics are in game, but there is a fair few from Group A or the 2000's that are still missing.\n-Leagues are entirely non-functional at the moment.\n-- Personally, i dont feel the game is finished and as such had no right to move out of early access. The game is AWESOME to play, just about all the major bases are covered, but so many little things in the game are broken or non-functional that it sours the experience.\n\nVerdit 7/10 (10 is possible) due to bugs,glitches and the general unfinished nature of the game as of Jan 2016.\nProbably not worth the 60 $ it is now, as PC gamers when we purchase a product for 60 $ we expect it to be done. Seeing as i bought my way into early access at 32.49, i in no way feel cheated and feel 40 $ is a good price for what has been achieved so far.\n\nWhat does this mean for a poor rally fan? -------->BUY IT ON SALE.<--------\n:D","January 27","true","265.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

A lot of work has also been put into making a steering wheel feel realistic when playing this game, unfortunately I only have an xbox controller, either way the gameplay is awesome and it feels really good to play. It feels like a realistic rally game should and is a great relief after having to deal with dissapointments like Dirt Showdown, not saying that it was a terrible game but it was not what I had hoped for when new Dirt games came out.\n\nMenus feel great, seems like I can't click anything with my mouse which is fine, you end up navigating with your controller or keyboard. The customization is pretty cool, you pick your own team to work with you on your car and races, different team members may be better at some things compared to others which can affect how good your car is for example.\n\nOnce you enter into a championship you can customize your car further by changing things like breaking, gears, cambers and more. The game tries to be pretty realistic, as you go up to the start you will need to hold the handbrake as the timer counts down, however, there is nothing stopping you from letting go of the handbrake and actually going early. Didn't check if this earns you a penalty, but I would assume it is not a good thing to do. If you were to drive backwards on the track you actually end up being disqualified from the championship which was interesting and costly. I also liked how any damage to your car is kept throughout the race from every collision.\n\nGetting familiar with controls was easy, they felt pretty standard, I played on the hardest difficulty which made it a bit hard to steer and break but after a while I got used to it. Finding the handbreak and learning to use it correctly in turns also helps a lot. I also noted that when I went off a really high cliff where my car could not be recovered I actually ended up losing the race which I thought was awesome because the game is right, I shouldn't be able to keep going if my car falls off a cliff.\n\nOverall I really like this game, I don't have anything negative to say about it at this time and I definitely recommend buying it, especially if it is on sale.","June 21, 2015","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

BUY THIS GAME!\n\nThis Dirt game is diffrent then 2 and 3. It droped the gymkhana (sorry for spelling) and focuses on the world of rally.\nThis game is still in early access and with what is here pre hillclimb and any thing other then just time rally runs i already feel like my 31 bucks was worth it. i would have easily been satifed with paying 50 -60 for this in its current state, knowing that some things will be fine tuned and added.\n\nI dont feel like this is a normal dirt "game" i feel like this is a rally simulator a thousands times more then the original dirt. why? Because the terrain and weather make it feel like your actually on a gravel road or that snowy, icy tarmac mountain side that you might fall off around that next hairpin that you pulled the ebrake to early on. point is this makes me feel like im in a rally car cruising down some dusty windy road going way to fast.\n\nPROS (just the big ones)\nCLUTCH and H-SHIFT PATTERN SUPPORT FOR G27\nmost wheels you can at least use gas , brakes and steering until support(or go buy a g27 like me cause you had to much fun with a thrustmaster and wanted to go all out)\n\nTIMED LAUNCH\nyou have to hold ee brake and floor it for best possible launch. too early you get docked -10 sec\n\nDAMAGE and TEAM MANAGEMENT\nso you have at least 4 stages to get your car in one piece. between each race you can do repairs for time. with money earned from races you can get better team members and your repairing becomes more efficent.\n\nGRAPHICS\nTHEY ARE GORGEOUS at least as good as forza next gens, if not better.\n\nCO-DRIVER\ni had no clue exactly whathe was shouting but you will know what a left 2 dont cut is when you see it and understand so you can focus on what is coming up next. you can also make him shout it out earlier or later if the default timing is off to you. it really depends on how fast your taking it.\n\nCONS\n\nnot all wheels supported\n\nearly access\n\nno hill climb yet\n\ndamage is a lil to strong. car should get totaled if you go 80 into a wall. hope the y add a damge slider.","May 3, 2015","true","58.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That said, it's not really a SIM, it's a very serious game with some decent underpinnings and good enough visuals to get the job done. Be prepared to play with the FFB settings to get rid of the muddled center and spring action and tweak the rest of it to get what you want. Well at least get it close enough... Once tweaked the FFB is as passable as AC or Race Room; canned as the day is long but giving the appropriate info. This is with  the base Fanatec "4za" wheel with an Elite pedal set, other wheels will vary.\n\nOne thing I lament right off the rip is the fact the wheel button/pedal schemes are cast in cement. It's 2015 not 1995... They say they're going to address this for different wheels which is great news, however I have to wonder if that will include telling the game I want to use a particular pedal or button for something regardless of input device. I am really hoping they get beyond the control schema looking at me stupid with a face full of "you want teh clutch pedal to do what..?" (...a clutch pedal that isn't usable in my pedal set ATM to boot, again something they purpose to fix...) The flexibility to add stand alone shifters and e-brakes for custom cockpits will go a long way towards immersion and aren't something I'd consider optional in this day and age, it would be a detriment to the title to leave this kind of thing out again.\n\nWhile we're weeping and wailing and gnashing teeth, the menu still being straight out of console land for a PC title is a bit bonehead classification worthy. You'll need to drag out your wheel manual and note what buttons are what numbers. Once I figured out where the buttons were it was navigable, I could even change the liveries with my shifter paddles. It's not like you can't get from here to there in the game on a wheel; it's just a PITA to do so on some occasions. I was able to use the keyboard as well, I had no issues mixing and matching the return and escape buttons into the wheel button mix at first. Once I got the hang of all the buttons the keyboard was able to be set aside. I shouldn't have to work so hard to get through a menu, mouse support should be like 2 or 3 on the list of things to fix/improve/implement. It's a PC game, it needs PC control.\n\nThe environment and atmosphere are done very well. Track side is lively enough yet not overbearing or intrusive. The graphics are dated but look just fine in play mode as I flail the wheel in 3rd hanging on for all I've got. Replays don't look quite as good, but are more than passable for me. I think they hired GT5 to make a guest appearance or something. While the surroundings look very good, the cars are aliased and a bit blocky and the damage model looks to be lifted straight from Kaz' special vault. Gotta love elongated oval lights that stretch like silly putty after an incident...\n\nSpeaking of damage... The "get some and have to repair it" side is perfectly done. It's not a stretch to have to swap tires, re-balance them or replace a cracked/stressed/bent rim. Clogged filters, oil changes, damage to the body and cooling systems or brakes that took a beating on a particularly bad section. All of this is there in a simple slider system. You repair them with Time, allotting what you can to whatever you want to fix. It all works well enough, isn't overly complicated, calls for some strategic decision making and acts as a wear and tear factor in addition to damage. At the end of a stage, money is subtracted from your winnings to bring the car back up to snuff for the next event. Again, a simple solution that's just enough to make for some nice extra immersion.\n\nI like how the crew expands and affects the car under you, just enough to give the "elite team" feel without going overboard. Throw in the simplified team management of hiring engineers and there is enough to give the game that little bit of extra depth. It's not like the game will collapse into a black hole without these features, but to me they are just enough to complete the whole Driver-Team-Race Day feel into a nice cohesive package that really helps establish immersion before I ever hit the track.\n\nI love the fact you can screw up. Royally. Like blow an entire stage or event due to being daft at the controls. In most minor incidents you can recover with a time penalty, a slight of hand that mimics the fans rolling you over or pushing you back to the stage so you can continue. However there are times when as a driver you really mess up and go too far off or do too much damage to continue. In those cases that's it, you're done. I'm glad the game has the stones to flirt with this kind of stark reality, I've already seen too many cries of take it out. I hope they don't. Really makes me appreciate the times when I get it right, and let's face it; nothing makes you learn how to drive better and use your head more than a couple DNFs.\n\nThe drive physics feel very good, they equate quite well to my real life experiences in similar conditions. The FFB gives me enough but could do so much more in this area, the information is somewhere between basic and detailed once the wheel is tweaked. I don't find issue with the braking, in a straight line with a vehicle specifically equipped for the conditions it's not surprising to see the level of performance the game gives. Where I look is when the car is out of shape and you ask it to do something it shouldn't be able to do. The first time you try to stomp the pedal while being slightly sideways and find it only makes you go more sideways and you find the road really isn't as wide as it looks and that trees and gravity are not your friends it begins to sink in that maybe the brakes aren't as good as you thought. I find the throttle control is very good, very much fun. Ripping the hairpins with the e-brake and powering out is a blast, feathering the throttle for that last bit of speed as you bob and weave and hang on is quite satisfying. The car hangs on quite well, at least as long as you are on the course.\n\nThere is one behavior I find peculiar, the car tends to bog down when no throttle is applied a bit too generously. In heavy mud, heavy snow or deep gravel I can see it, on ice or tarmac..? Not so much. The only thing I can think of that would cause this behavior is a ton of drive line drag, something that would be in play with short, tight gearing. That said, as much as I like that I can rely on this "feature" it seems a bit over done. I think this plays into the too much grip or braking too good feeling as well.\n\nThe co driver works fine for me, and it's really well done. I love it when I get into fast or tight sections and I can get him to stutter or get a bit confused. Don't know if it's intentional or if the game is just trying to cue up files for the next corners, but hearing him fumble about just adds that little extra edge of urgency and immersion for me. I hope it stays that way.\n\nOver all the game is a bucket load of fun. I'm not constantly harassed by console energy drift garbage, the atmosphere and the drive are really well done, the stages are great including the almighty DNF for being an NDMF. (...non driving mother fill in the blank...) It's already a great run out of the gate for fun mixed with a good dose of realism. Yeah it has it's issues, but what game doesn't..? And they are only going to add more to it to boot. Worth the money already.\n\nIf you're on the fence about it, all you'll get are splinters in your butt squirming around the should I or shouldn't I. Just take into account the limitations of presets for wheels and the menus being button and keyboard before you jump. Once past that bit of reliving the 90's there's nothing but merciless fun to be had.\n\nCheers..!","May 2, 2015","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nearly all of the issues I had with DiRT Rally have been ironed out throughout the year, with my final biggest gripes being sorted in version 1.0.\n\nThis is a wonderful representation of Rally with a great selection of cars from the history of the sport. I'd love more locations, but the stages that have been included are very high quality and provide an excellent "greatest hits" of what rallying around the world has to offer. I am very pleased with their decision to model real-world stages.\n\nThe actual driving experience (using G27) is simply one of the best pieces of computer-based entertainment I have experienced. I said something similar in my initial review below, but this has only improved in my eyes.\n\nThe RX and Pikes Peak content are nice extras to the game. It'd be great if this project leads to a new licenced rallycross title that continues with the more "authentic"/"sim" approach to modelling the sport and includes the full World RX season, as well as a "sequel" to DiRT Rally that simply has a larger selection of rally locations with a bigger budget.\n\nDiRT Rally is an excellent title. If you have any interest at all in the sport (and ideally a wheel) and are prepared to fail a lot (all part of the fun!) then this is well worth the purchase.\n\n\n\n\n[22 May 2015:] My rule of thumb in judging an Early Access game: "If development were to stop right now, would I be happy with my purchase?" In this case, it's a definite yes.\n\nAnd luckily, development is on track to add a lot more and produce a truly fantastic game once 1.0 comes around. I am impressed with the way the development team is handling community feedback and it seems they are listening to the right things.\n\nIn its current form it still has its problems, particularly the FFB, but the main ones have been acknowledged by the dev team and fixes/improvements are in the works.\n\nIt is not easy, but in my opinion that is the way it should be in a game aiming to be a rally "sim". I am not super skilled at sims, but play with a wheel and no assists, and I have only won two stages in career mode so far (over 30 hours). But that doesn't matter, as my gradual improvement has been one of the most rewarding things I have experienced in a game.\n\nDespite a few flaws at this stage of development, my time spent with the game in the first few weeks has been some of the most fun I have ever had at a computer.","May 21, 2015","true","146.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

DiRT Rally is literally the best racing game I have ever played. But what makes it "the best" I've ever played? Here is my review for DiRT Rally!\n\nTo simplify things a bit, let me split this into separate "categories"\n\n1. Graphics\nThe Graphical quality of this game is intense, probably one of the best graphically designed games I've ever played. From the track, to the grass, to the trees, and to the vehicles - this is one helluva beautiful game.\n\n2. Realism\nThe amount of realism in DiRT Rally is amazing, from on-track performance to off-road performance, It's incredible.\n\n3. Vehicles\nDiRT Rally offers a great amount of vehicles. From Rally Racing, Hillclimb, to Rallycross! The variety of vehicles are fairly good, enough to fit everybody's vehicle interests.\n\n4. Single & Multiplayer\nJust as any racing game, DiRT Rally provides us with our usual Single-Player mode, but in addition to this, we now have the option to play on the Multiplayer game mode! Want to race some friends, or some random opponents? This game is for you.\n\n5. Controls\nThe control setup is so easy it's nearly flat-out stupid, as DiRT Rally supports PC Gamers, plus Console Gamers! Let's not forget our good ol' Steering Wheel.\n\n6. ESRB Rating\nThe fun part of the game is that anybody can play it, there are no age restrictions at all. As the game is rated "E" for "Everyone", everyone is welcome to play, of course!\n\nMy opinion? $49.99 is definitely worth spending for DiRT Rally.","December 8, 2015","true","192.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The cars feel very real to drive, and the sounds and graphics are also very impressive.

I run it on Ultra with my Gtx 560 Ti 2GB, and fps differs in each stage, but it's mostly about 30 fps or so. I drive in cockpit view, using an Xbox 360 controller, and man, it just feels fantastic. The only problem I have with this game so far is the damage model. It's still far away from being as realistic as Richard Burns Rally's damage model. I would also like to see specifically which parts are damaged, like which parts of the engine are damaged for example, not just a health bar for the overall engine damage, and you should be able to fix the different parts seperately like in Richard Burns Rally. Well anyways, the game is excellent, and I am glad I bought it.

The visuals, sounds, FFB and physics are unmatched by any other game (yes including RBR).

I haven't liked racing games for soo long. But this game is something else. It looks SO realistic (maxxed out in 1080p) and the car handles like a real vehicle. I play from helmet view and the steering wheel (in-game) shakes with the ground realistically, the rumble in the 360 is realistic to the point you can drive based on it (just like in real life when off roading and feeling the road in your steering wheel), the weight of the vehicle is spot on, the sense of speed is spot on, oh my gawd I totally enjoy this game. The VERY FIRST TIME I played it i didn't crash but did a great lap! My real life driving skills (which are superrrb) translated perfectly into the game. I'm awestruck.

I've played pretty much every rally game that's come out for the PC since the late 90's, Mobil 1 Rally Championship, Colin McRae, Dirt, Richard Burns Rally, you name it I've played them and this is up there with RBR and M1RC as one of the greats.\n\nHandling feels pretty realistic in that cars aren't on rails, you can't let off the gas to make every turn at near full speed, damage is pretty realistic in that a slight off can puncture a tire and do some bad damage. The stages are longer than in DIRT but not nearly as long as M1RC or even some RBR stages, but they're decently long at about 6-8 minutes for the majority.\n\nThere are a lot of different types of cars and they do feel realistic for their age, ie: modern WRC cars are insanely fast and handle a lot better than some of the early FWD rally cars (Mini).\n\nIf you want a really good rally game that looks pretty pick this up as soon as you can, I don't think you'll regret it.","April 29, 2015","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Saved Replays. After all the blood sweat and tears it would be nice to sit in the motorhome and watch how you barely survived a stage on the ragged edge.

The cars feel very real to drive, and the sounds and graphics are also very impressive. My current graphics card struggles to run the game on Ultra though, but I do it anyways, since it looks so good on Ultra. I run it on Ultra with my Gtx 560 Ti 2GB, and fps differs in each stage, but it's mostly about 30 fps or so. I drive in cockpit view, using an Xbox 360 controller, and man, it just feels fantastic. The only problem I have with this game so far is the damage model. It's still far away from being as realistic as Richard Burns Rally's damage model. I would also like to see specifically which parts are damaged, like which parts of the engine are damaged for example, not just a health bar for the overall engine damage, and you should be able to fix the different parts seperately like in Richard Burns Rally. Well anyways, the game is excellent, and I am glad I bought it. I can only see it getting better and better.","October 14, 2015","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No idea at\nthe time that 4 hours later i would have consumed 2 liters of water...\n\nThis game demands your full attention, and if you for some reason\nfeel the game doesn't deserve that. It rewards you with front row\ntickets to the close up of spruce and birch.\n\nBest racing simulator made in many years - Highly recommended!","December 8, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
