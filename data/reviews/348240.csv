"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kennyfrommodesto/recommended/348240/","kennyfrommodesto","kennyfrommodesto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kennyfrommodesto/","36 products in account","At $4, this may be the best shooter deal on Steam.\n\nI initially misjudged the music as mostly forgettable. However, after 7 hours of play, it has really grown on me. It's well done, complex, and apporopriate. On the whole surely above average. Sound effects are nicely done as well.\n\nThe graphics are technically adequate, and artistically very nice. Enemy bullets are colorful and easily distinguished from the backgrounds. The backgrounds are nicely done and enjoyable to look at. They're not the Plain-Jane, drab work you might expect from a budget game. However, the game seems to be running at 30fps, but that's just my guess. The in-game FPS counter I have enabled in the Steam options is curiously absent from this title alone. Graphics could use a resolution bump as well. The game looks quite good in windowed mode, but a little blocky in full screen. Not too bad though. Speaking of full screen, there is no immediately apparent way to activate full screen mode. There is no options menu to be found. Pressing F11 will toggle between full screen and windowed mode. It would be nice to see a setup or options screen to adjust sound/music levels and select full screen. Or at least have some text on the main screen that says, "Press F11 for full screen".\n\nGameplay is fluid and has a couple of interesting mechanics at work. The hit box is small and cleary defined. You choose from three charachters--red/yellow/blue. Each color has a different weapon pattern and can absorb like-colored enemy bullets (ie red bulltes do not harm the red player). Without getting into detail, absorbing enemy fire benefits you. Also the trigger buttons on the 360 controller slow down the movement of your player to give you greater control to weave in and out of the more intracite waves of bullets.\n\nDifficulty ramps up nicely after the 2nd level and the 5th and 6th level were designed to submit you.\n\nFor $4 it's a no-brainer for the shooter fan. I HIGHLY reccomend it.","December 8, 2015","true","14.0"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","1"

It's ok.\n\nThis is another one of those little vertical-scrolling arcade-style action games wherein hoards of enemies fly in from the top of the screen and shoot glowing globs of stuff which you need to keep your fast moving spacecraft (or in this case, your fast moving anime girl) from bumping into while you hose the entire screen down with your own faster-moving firepower. As is normal for this genre, this is not an easy game, even when played on the easiest difficulty.\n\n+3 Different difficulty levels.\n+3 Different characters to choose from each of which have 2 different modes.\n+Good menu design.\n+Nice stages and enemy design.\n+This game is very inexpensive.\n\n+/-Adequate sound and music.\n+/-Extremely difficult (but then nearly all games of this kind are extremely difficult).\n\n-Why do you not have little spaceships to control? Why are you controlling little anime girls? Despite the game's attempt at an explanation this really doesn't make much sense but then, this is by no means the first game in this genre to portray flying anime girls in lieu of nifty looking spacecraft.\n-I cannot resize the game's resolution and there is no menu option to play in anything other than windowed mode. This is the game's biggest problem. This means that if you are using a monitor in the now standard 1920 by 1080p resolution this game's window will be pretty small and thus all the enemies and their projectiles will be that much harder to see. This is not an extra degree of challenge which this game needs and I'm not going to resize my monitor just to suit this silly little game.","April 16","false","1.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's a decent story that ties the gameplay together.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe Gameplay is fast and fluid, it can be dificult at times, but it's always fair. At the end of each stage there is a boss fight, which is always diffirent and changes things up.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe graphics are really polished and well done, the sprites all move fluidly, and there is a variety of enemies and locations.\n\nMusic:\n\nThe Music really works with the game, it's hyper and gets you excited to play.

So I bought this game with no prior experiences with this type of game. I'm INSTANTLY addicted. About as addicted as I am to KSP, but I digress.\n\nThe game is about three cybernetic girls tasked with stopping a meteorite from hitting the Earth, which would probably cause all life as we know it to die. The controls are just fine in my opinion, and the graphics are great. Character and enemy sprites, as well as bullets, are easily distinguishable from the backgrounds, and makes the game less confusing when bullets are being fired at your character like fifteen Heavyweapons guys firing miniguns at you non-stop.\n\nMusic and sound effects are really nice and are rather relaxing for what's happening in-game while fitting with their stages nicely. On the topic of stages, each one gets progressively more difficult as you make your way through the barrage of bullets constantly headed toward your character, and there's no real difficulty spikes, which probably helps make it addicting, but I dunno.\n\nThe game is short, but I'm probably the only one who finds it a good thing, as some people might have the around 1-2 hours it can take to finish the game without taking into consideration the achievements and whatnot.\n\nOverall, I rate it... Around a 9.8/10, because I think it SHOULD probably have one or two more stages... :P","December 31, 2015","true","12.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
