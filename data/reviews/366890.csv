You should take criticism as a guide to improve your work. My two cents on Zombie Zoeds , this game is bad. Theres a slow reaction to the gun at the beginning with a overwhelming amount of zombies. Players don't have a chance to proceed to other stages or feel a sense of accomplishment without getting frustrated the second they play the game. I couldn't find a screen which showed me the controls or how to play. If this was the first game you made ,  awesome! I wish I had such talent. Should have this game been sold ? Absolutely not. The good part , this game comes with Steam cards. I was one of the many people who voted yes to greenlight this game because It looked fun. Playing the game doesnt do the video justice. Perhaps Project Greenlight should have a demo to play before people can vote yes or no. If you want to get some tips on an awesome game similar to this one check out - I Made a Game with Zombies In It!

The way it functions is absolutely beyond my meager comprehension, the controls reflect the general mood of the game, utter chaos. There's a suprise behind every key press as you frantically search for the basic controls as the reanimated ghouls of the night are set upon you. I could not locate any sort of tutorial or controls list, however, I believe this is a stroke of genius. In a real life zombie apocalypse, would you be able to press escape for a controls list?\n\nThe gunplay in this game is excellent and realistic, there are multiple firing modes in which all but one are useless, just like in real life, full auto or nothing.\n\nThe zombies themselves and the environments are probably the weakpoint of the game as they don't stand out and the zombies appear to mainly just be palette swaps of the same model. In retrospect, this rather simple approach does have quite a unique appeal to it in this age of super detailed zombies.\n\nIn conclusion, despite all the positives and features this game has to offer, I simply  cannot  justify the 43 pence that someone spent on this game to buy me as a joke.\n\n2/10","June 22, 2015","false","0.5"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","95","20","21","18","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/366890/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2359 products in account","The description of the game claims that it is quite complicated. But in reality the game is very simple. What’s complicated is figuring out how all these poor game design decisions came together to form this mess of mechanics.\n\nZombie Zoeds pits you as a nameless thing shooting other things. You can only shoot in the direction you are facing, and moving around feels like you are steering a cart drawn by dead horses. Your character has to forcibly swing himself around like a boat in order to change the direction he is facing. But all of these clunky movements fit perfectly because your bullets actually fire off center. So while you are surrounded by zombies and being mauled from all sides, you will soon discover that the zombie directly in front of you is actually dodging all of your bullets because he is in front of you and your character wields his gun completely to the side of what he is looking at. It gets even better though, because this particular gun you start with (the Patron) is modeled after Haley’s comet because you only shoot one bullet every 75 years or so. You also shoot bullets the size of threading needles. So don’t ever worry about trying to hit an enemy on purpose, because this is mostly a game of waddling around and clicking in hopes of hitting something.\n\nI have no idea where the game goes beyond that. You have some kind of score based on your kills and also how many survivors die. This score doesn’t really go anywhere. There is for the weapons “Lazer” and “Lazer 2” at the bottom of the screen but I don’t think I can commit to ever finding those weapons. Along with the lack of goals, the game is incredibly bland in general. The game’s sound design is brought to you by public domain night sounds, nonstop. The art style has poor color choices and too much repetition in general.\nThe trees in the game all look the same and, together with the ground, seem to be from a completely different style from the enemies and player. Despite this being a top-down game, the trees all have their trunks visible and don’t follow the perspective. On top of this, these trees are surrounded by an invisible box that is impassable. This means that your game of wildly unintuitive shooting and movement is also interrupted by these clone trees wielding force fields. They are out of place stylistically and I have no idea what they add to the game. There is no need to take cover behind them because that would require quicker movements than your character would allow. These trees also don't provide resources, because this game has no mechanics beyond shooting the same stock enemies for no other goal than to watch a number get bigger.  The trees also fail at being landmarks because they all pretty much look the same, and chances are if you are close enough to see them, you are probably in danger of being caught up in their invisible walls.\n\nYou are controlling an old boat disguised as a person, shooting tiny straws slowly around your enemies while treading through treacherous waters of mismatched art, trees, and no sense of purpose.  This game needs landscaping among so many other things.\n","August 13, 2015","false","2.7"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","100","15","15","6","0"

Zombie Zoeds is a top down shooter the kind where u kinda run around the map and shoot at ennemies swarming you. But unlike the ones you might have played on websites for free, this game does not even feel like an excuse to have ads in, it doesnt even feel like it pretends to be fun, its just very bad. First off pressing R for reload or Q or any keys you arent supposed to will shut down the ambiant sound for no reason. The Menu only has start game and load, no options, the game doesnt have any intro, or end/death screen, you just are dumped onto the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ grass map with a few trees here and there, dont get near the trees your character will glitch out a bit and move about randomly. You are armed with basically a BB gun, and , lol, the pellets for it are called patrons for some reason, its kind of funny and induced me some kind of feeling of shame that I owned the title by that point, and that was only a minute in. You cant aim your bb gun at all, you gotta just press the mouse button and your character will blindly fire forward, at a very slow pace, aiming is thus reduced to your ability to move your character, but the controls with WASD dont really have diagonals, and if you are just a little off target by being too high or too low you will miss, so to readjust you have to do this cumbersome little dance where you move back not to get caught, go down, turn around to face the ennemy, but by then the zombie is on you and you gotta move away anyway, there is no animation to speak of and the zombies just drag around frozen still with their arms extended. So all things considered this isnt a top down shooter at all, this is a patience game, like solitaire, and your main weapon isnt your gun, its the ai`s desire to returned to their original spot after chasing for a while. So basically this is a very boring game where you kite uninspired ennemies in a clunky forgettable and ugly game and slowly chip at them with no satisfaction whatsoever. I mean I have always had a very generous nature when it comes to supporting devs, even untalented ones, or ones with dubious business practices, I just like to get everything and try it out. But ... this really feels like someone is trolling, and making a few bucks while they are at it. It is an insult of a game, and really tarnishes steam`s image in my humble opinion.","October 10, 2015","false","5.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

This is possibly the biggest pile of garbage you will ever come across. Indeed even if this were free I'd be complaining.\n\nThe negatives of this game are innumerable though I will attempt to detail some of them.\n\nFirstly the gameplay is simply diabolical. The previous reviews are absolutely spot on, for this game cannot even get the basics right and if you thought Iznogoud was bad when it came to game design (not being able to move and jump at the same time), then this surely takes it to a whole new level. There's no being able to aim and shoot independently of the direction in which you're travelling, oh no that would have been FAR too difficult to program!\n\nWhen you die (which you will do because of the shoddy controls and gameplay) you're automatically taken back to the title screen and that's it. There's no story either, so if you're after a riveting narrative on the level of The Longest Journey then you can forget it. There isn't even a menu option to change the resolution from something that appears to have been made using a brick, to something acceptable by a neanderthal's technological standards!\n\nThe final straw is the fact that this is the second time I've bought this game. As ludicrous as this sounds this game bypassed Steam's Greenlight, thereby making a mockery of the whole initiative. The mistake I made was to give financial support to the muppet who made this game, though the one thing I can do to make amends is to warn others not to do the same; not to support such shoddy thievery.","June 20, 2015","false","2.1"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

There are so many things I could talk about when discussing this masterpiece.\n\nThe game drops you in a dark area, with no objective, and nothing but a torch and an Automatic Kalashnikov for company. The lack of an objective or any instructions really brings out the survival horror elements of the game, showing the player of the chaotic world they are about to find themselves in.\n\nYou can't go too far without noticing the harsh reality you suddenly find yourself in. The world has been overrun with infected humans, and these flesh craving beings will stop at nothing to tear you apart, limb from limb. Your character, dressed in blue and armed and deadly, must protect himself from these hellish things the only way he can, with his Shooting iron and his wits. You can only shoot in the direction you are facing, and the only way to turn is to walk, this is some next level immersion, true survival grit, and a very daring move for the devs. This has payed off, as I found myself completely immersed in the game, and it really brings out its survival horror elements.\n\nThe zombies I found to be quite realistic, and their movement patterns, as well as their movement speed, are very reminiscent of games such as Left 4 Dead. The scarcity of ammunition is such an important addition to the games whole survival feeling, and running out of ammunition can really bring out the best survival elements of the game.\nAt the bottom of the screen, there is a counter for ‘Lazer’, set at 0, which, to me, symbolized the lack of a future for the character, and it was up to the player to destroy as many zombies as possible in order to change the future of the character, and indeed, the world he lives in.\n\nI really love the lack of a menu, as it symbolizes the lack of options humanity has in this post-apocalyptic world. The Resolution is locked at 800x600, the optimal resolution for playing this masterpiece. Pressing Esc does absolutely nothing, symbolizing the inability for your character to escape the situation he is in. At the end of the park you find yourself in, there is a large pink circle with “Evacuation Zone” written on it, showing that your character has no way out, and must fight until the end.\n\nThe lack of a soundtrack really draws the player into full immersion, as all you can her is the sound of the darkness.\n\nGraphics: 10\nThis game just looks fantastic, the zombies are terrifyingly realistic, the ground and tree textures look almost photorealistic.\n\nSound: 10\nThe game has no soundtrack, and it doesn’t need one, all of the sounds add to the horror elements, as I felt like I was really there.\n\nFunctionality: 10\nI encountered absolutely no glitches during this game. I did see a few invisible ZOEDS, but I am sure that was intentional, a completely new enemy type.\n\nOverall, I have to give this game a 10 out of 10, and recommend it to anyone who enjoys survival horror games, horror games, survival games, zombie games, or just games in general, theres something for everyone here. A must buy.\n","September 29, 2015","true","16.6"," 55 of 99 people (56%) found this review helpful 106 people found this review funny","56","55","99","106","5"

Is this game quite complicated? No, it isn't. Wide variety of levels and large maps? You wish. Elements of horror? Do they mean the cheap zombies and non-zombie clowns? The artificial intelligence is absolutely abhorrent. Gameplay is not excellent. The graphics are not beautiful. The atmosphere is not wonderful. In fact, in my experience, if you constantly retreat to the starting zone you will be safe because the zombies just turn right back around. If you try to play it fair though, you turn slowly, can only shoot forward with huge gaps between firing opportunities, and get mobbed fast. The graphics are terrible, as is the sound. And as I played, killing the zombies actually detracted from my score!

So I assume Application 1 is loading me into the first level, right? I go and clean up my floor, brush my teeth, take a trip to the bathroom, and grab a dried fruit pouch to find it still not "loaded." Of course, I click the "New Game" button on Application 1's loading screen, and unexpectedly, Application 1 then thrusts me into this grassy plain with a bunch of boxes in front of me. Being a fan of free stuff, I lunge at Application 1's boxes and see that nothing happens. "Okay Application 1," I think, "maybe my ammunition or something is full." That is when Application 1's specialties come at me, the zombies. Using the gun that Application 1 has supplied me, I attempt to shoot. One shot. And the sound doesn't even finish. I hold down the left mouse button, telling Application 1 that I'd like to shoot, but of course, it only fires one shot, again (even though what I'm holding seems to be an automatic weapon). Of course, Application 1's zombies murder me, because I am unable to shoot more than one bullet at a time.\n\nWould I recommend Application 1 to a friend?

Everything about this is bad: movement, weapons, shooting, zombies, "beautiful graphics" and whatever else this game has. You can only shoot in the direction you are facing, and you face the direction you are moving. It means it's kind of hard to shoot at zombies when you're running away from them. The shooting is horrible also: you got to hold left click down to shoot and the first bullet flies out like a second after you start holding it.

Turns out, nothing means Hulk Hogan. Somebody get BAD NEWS BROWN on the blower to break it to him. I warned alllllll of you since the Pontiac Silverdome. Hulk Hogan is a TOILET MAN.\n\nHogan, I may be a ghost now, talkin' from the tombstones, but I've still got my ear to this grape vine and I've been hearing some DIABOLICAL WHISPERS about your behavior. Now, if I am one thing other than the greatest wrestler to ever dominate the squared circle it is a good judge of character.\n\nI knew you were trouble from the moment you first ran in on my match with Brutus the Barber Beefcake with a chair. People thought you were a real abolitionist but it turns out the only thing you were interested in abolishing was the Mega Powers with your treacherous tricks.\n\nI am ROYALLY VINDICATED.\n\nBrothers? Ohhhhhh YEEEEEEEAH! Rap-talkin', daughter-touchin', no sideways-caps-allowin' Hulksters want to talk about brothers.\n\nLet me tell you what a brother doesn't do in the Macho Man book by Macho Man Randy Savage. A brother doesn't sell his friend out to Ted DiBiase. A brother doesn't put Miss Elizabeth in DANGER. A brother doesn't do somethin' so heinous that my feud with him gets deleted from the WWE website. Macho Man didn't do nothing. I'm still a legend. But I'm COLLATERAL DAMAGE on Hulk Hogan's ROAD TO RUINS. I'm like Bubba the Love Sponge's marriage. I'm like a video on Gawker, getting SCRUBBED AND RUBBED.\n\nLet me drop some more DYLANN TRUTH on you, Hogan. I am better than everyone in the World Wresting Federation, Hogan, but I learned that in the ring, not WEARING A HOOD and reading Mein Kampf from the library. Morgan Freeman says they track who checks that out, BROTHER, so you better watch yourself. Because at this point, he could beat you from one side of Royal Rumble to the other.\n\nI may look like Crypt Keeper with a painted-on hobo beard, but you're looking like a Costco chicken that would get winded from a CHEST SLAP. And you're still signin' them tweets HH.\n\nHulk Hogan may not want Booker T back in chains, but he has nothing against running into the ring on WCW Monday Nitro and putting him through a table. Using two chairs and tagging in half the NWO. Yeah, pure athlete Booker T would do a flying scissors kick or the Bookend. Meanwhile OLD MAN HOGAN would showboat for a LEG DROP. It's RAW HATE FEELINGS like that why I joined up with Zeus at Summer Slam only to lose once again to Hogan treachery.\n\nIt's a record more broken than a Brooke Hogan CD lost in a trucker's seat cushion. Every time anyone trusts this WICKED WARRIOR they are sure to be burned like a cross at a Hogan family pasta pool party. This is as DEVIOUS as it is DISGUSTING.\n\nIt turns out the REAL HULKAMANIA is lack of empathy for the struggle of others growing up in a diverse nation like ours. So put down the REBEL FLAG, Hogan, and pick up the Stars and Stripes. It's time to take down the Hogan flying over the capital D for DIPWAD.","July 28, 2015","false","0.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

As I wandered through the wilderness avoiding the zombie even the crickets in the background stopped, now im in silence, I closed the game.

They turned out to be the people I was supposed to be saving. I only learned when my score went negative that "oh these aren't zombies." Anyway. They follow you around but don't move as fast as you. I kind of left them behind because i'm a lone wolf and don't have time for their ♥♥♥♥. Also the fact that your gun doesn't do damage for crap. and you can't really aim it either. You shoot with mouse, but you don't aim that way, baby. You aim the same way you move (which is atrocious).

It takes about a minute to realize how unfun and terrible it is.\n\nIt's a 2D, top-down game where zombies attack you and you try to survive. I think. I have no clue. There's an evacuation zone and other people. I'm sure you're supposed to get the people to the zone. I don't know though, because you can't survive. You can't survive because you can only shoot in the direction you're facing. Your options are to stand still and fire your very slow gun at a large crowd of zombies OR head towards the zombies. Also, the zombies are faster than you and some of them have a ranged attack. Oh, and the other people who maybe you have to rescue are slower than you.\n\nThe main menu IS IN THE GAME. If you go up from your starting point even slightly, there it is. A little dimmer and it flickers, but there it is. Not just the buttons, but the graphic and if you go inside the graphic you cannot shoot your gun.\n\nOn top of that the graphics are pretty bad. Very little effort was put in to them. Also, it says it has achievements, it does not. Oh, and if you die and start a new round your score will be in the negatives. Yaaay.\n\nDo not buy this game.

Luckily I've bought it for money earned off selling trading cards, so I hope the cards in this game make up for its value.\n\nThe graphics are really bad, sounds are crappy, the music is nonexistent, controls are a bit vague, gameplay is boring - this could be a high school project for all I care.

While Steam Greenlight can occasionally let players get access to a gem of an indie game that they might have otherwise missed, Zombie Zoeds is the sort of game that makes it abundantly clear that Greenlight is more often an over-abused program that lets scamware slip through the cracks.\n\nFirst off, Zombie Zoeds feels like the sort of game that you should be able to play for free on a dodgy flash website. You know the sort, right? The kind that clutters up the browser window with malicious ads that attempt to install spyware onto your computer.\n\nDon't let the trailer video fool you, because the music in this game is non-existant, and the sound effects and animations are minimal. There's some ambient sound in the early part of the game, in the form of chirping crickets, but it seems to cut out randomly. The controls are extraordinarily awkward, instructions on keybindings are completely absent, and when you die the game simply cuts back to the title screen without any sort of "Game Over" screen. There's a basic scoring mechanic, but it's entirely meaningless and your score only resets when you exit and restart the program, rather than when you die and start a new game.\n\nThe game is missing very basic functions, such as an options screen, a volume slider, and the ability to run the game in windowed mode. On top of that, it quickly becomes obvious that the developers are native to Europe, and that they couldn't even be bothered to do some very basic translation work ("Patrons" instead of "Ammo", "Lazer" instead of "Laser").\n\nEven ignoring that, the developers in this case have been dodgy since day one. They originally offered the game as part of a bundle, under the title "Zombie Zoids". In an apparent attempt to avoid this obligation, they changed the title by one letter to "Zombie Zoeds". When they finally owned up and distributed the game to everyone who had payed for it, the game was missing it's primary executable file and could not be played - and when they actually DID include one, it registered on some virus scanners as a potential backdoor virus.\n\nEven now the Steam page is rife with lies, promising Steam Achievements (absent), Steam Cloud Support (absent), and Steam Workshop (absent). The only saving grace is that the game DOES have Steam Cards enabled, so if you got the game at a deep enough discount you may be able to make your money back by farming the cards.\n\nBut honestly, if you're after cards, then you'd probably be better off just buying booster packs on the Steam Market rather than cluttering up your playlist with this mess.","October 31, 2015","false","0.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Actually the controls are complicated not the game itself)\nA wide variety of levels and large maps. (I don’t know, I throw it away after 5 minutes)\nThe game itself has elements of horror. (At the same time being PEGI 3)\nIn the story you're a soldier who was sent to the lab and get to know what happened. (I thought I was a police man)\nBefore that you have to go through many levels. (Again, removed it after 5 minutes)\nRemove them from the zombies. (???)\nZombies good Artificial Intelligence. (Oh they do know how not get shot)\nThe gameplay is excellent and beautiful graphics. (Some NES games were prettier)\nAll this gives a wonderful atmosphere. (Atmosphere of s***)\nPlay and kill as many zombies.You will have to kill soldiers and turrets. Earn points and win. (Turrets? I always wanted to kill a turret!)\n\nSo even the description is as bad as the game.

My friend sent it to me as a gift, and when I played it, I realizd why. It gives no instruction. Just throws you into a level with a gun. I died a lot the first few games I played, beaue I could only shoot 1 bullet every 3 seconds or so. And it takes multiple shots to kill a zombie. But then, I realized that you can press 1, 2, and 3 to change your ammo. 3 makes it fully auto. And then, after I figured out how to shoot and survive, I andered around. And found some people. The people die very easily and you lose 100 points every time one dies. And you only get 10 per zombie. So your score is going to be very negative. And I still dont how to move on to the next level or what to do with the people. Overall, this game sucks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kerviel/recommended/366890/","kerviel","Shuny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kerviel/","170 products in account","I was "gifted" this game ... Saying that Zombie Zoeds is a bad game is an understatement. The game starts in a horribly low resolution (something close to 800x600 (EDIT: It's actually 640x480)) but this is not a problem since the game is ugly anyway.\n\nThe game itself is a twin-stick shooter where you must kill zombies and try to reach the highest score.  Well, "twin stick shooter" ... sort of. You can only aim in the direction where you're moving, meaning that you'll need to stop and rotate if you want to shoot anything in this game, making the game extremely difficult.\n\nAlmost everything is bugged: When you start a game, if you go down you'll reach an area where your framerate will decrease to 1 FPS. If you then try to go left, you'll be able to go out of bounds and you'll be stuck there forever. There is no notion of height or depth in this game, meaning that you cannot go under the trees (you'll collide with the leafs). Speaking of the trees, the zombies will often get stuck into them,\n\nYou'll also notice if you go up starting from the spawn that the menu of the game is actually a part of the map: You can see the "New Game, Loading and EXIT" writings on the ground. An absolute joke\n\nThere is an "Evacuation Zone" but it doesn't do anything. (EDIT: You can actually bring civilians to the evacuation zone for points)\n\nYou have 3 basics weapons, the first one having 3 different fire modes: Don't get fooled, there is no point swapping between each as it changes only the fire rate and you'll only use the third one (fastest firing rate) anyway. I was unable to test the 2 other weapons, and I'm not even sure they can be used at all. I tried to fiddle with Cheat Engine to see if I could add ammo to them, and I managed to shoot once with each weapon, but it didn't do anything except play a laser sound.\n\nThe sound design is horrible: You'll hear a sound of crickets which is looped during the entire game. Fortuantely there is a button to mute it, which is probably the best feature of the game.\n\nI could go on but I really don't want to waste more time on this game. I've seen student projects being much better than Zombie Zoeds. It's not even a bad game, it's a scam and should be removed from Steam.","December 23, 2015","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/itzRGN/recommended/366890/","itzRGN","RGN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/itzRGN/","81 products in account","This game is an insult to the steam store and valve itself. How did this make it to the steam store? This is very under-developed game. The game was gifted to me by a friend who enjoys sending appalling games to friends. I found it quite humorous to find a message on my screen seeing I was given a gift. Then all of a sudden I started the game and quickly wanted to stick my head in a guillotine. A little excessive? Not at all I hated this game and truly wished I had not even considered playing it. I usually have a requirement for my reviews; 50 hours play-time for full games, and 25 hours for Alphas, Betas, indie, and small title releases. I was not applying that rule to this failure, seeing that I gave up within two minutes. Realized steam needed at least five minutes to write a review so I put the game on and threw on some random video to pass the time.  I did not want to put 25 hours into this game, I only wanted to drain the blood out of my ear, after playing this ear abuse. The shooting is awful and when you can actually get the gun to fire your ears explode as if the gun was shooting in your ear not the game. The music is way too dull and it sounds as if it is either a loop or a 300 year long disease growing into your ears. I can’t really find a single positive in this game. The controls are fairly basic and pretty easy to learn. Shooting is the worst thing I have ever seen you aim in diagonals, you never hit a shot on a zombie even when your gun is in their body as they obliterate your tiny pixel commando. I can hardly see a story, or any type of narrative. The game is a main menu and that’s it. You press start or just wait till it starts on its own. The game throws you in the Microsoft paint texture map that the main menu is painted onto the floor making you wonder if this is the game or a very long and inferior loading screen.\n\nIt’s hilarious how underdeveloped this game is. Zombie Zoid is such an abomination of a game that the developers can't even be bothered to spell the title consistently. The title screen calls the game "Zombie Zoeds" and that is also its name on Steam, but some promotional material for the game such as Steam's trading cards refer to the game as Zombie Zoids. The game has a team that must have thought that this anathema was a masterpiece and brings something new to gamers. Not only is the game awful, but why zombies? We have at least a million trash zombie games, ill name a few bad zombie releases; Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler's Green, Burn zombie burn, ZOMBIE ZOEDS, Zombie Fort, The War Z, Infestation: Survivor Stories. That’s just to name a few, trust me I can go on and on with these terrible zombie games.\nIm done wasting my time with this atrocious zombie game, I mean c’mon who played this and thought this was amazing and thought that it deserved to be released.\n\nMy final ruling is a 1/10. One of the worst games I’ve ever had the displeasure to play.\n","December 25, 2015","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hitting enemies is luck based. Second, you can get stucked a lot. Then if you press "start game" it seems too freeze. No, everything is fine, it only loads for about 1 minute. Next thing, you can't look how the controls are...\nBut if someone really is masochistic, with W, A, S, D you move arround and hold down the left mouse button is shooting. No aiming is programmed, so don't search for it also no strafe mode. The button 1 is slow shooting frequence. Button 2 is medium fire frequence and 3 is for fast shooting frequence.\nThe goal seems to rescue the civilisation to the "evacuation point", which is clearly made with paint. But never ever rescued even one...\nZombies are only basic and spitters. The spitters shows the next issue, because their spit have the exact same color as the ground...\nNext up is the terrible sound, only gun shooting and some chirp of cicadas. The zombies and if you hit seems not to having any sounds...\nNext up the promised Achievements and Trading Cards seems none existing...\nBut the hugest issue is, that the game is 100% uncontrolable!!!\nDo yourself a favour and don't buy it, there are better twin stick shooters, like "Beat Hazard".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/itzRGN/recommended/366890/","itzRGN","RGN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/itzRGN/","81 products in account","This game is an insult to the steam store and valve itself. How did this make it to the steam store? This is very under-developed game. The game was gifted to me by a friend who enjoys sending appalling games to friends. I found it quite humorous to find a message on my screen seeing I was given a gift. Then all of a sudden I started the game and quickly wanted to stick my head in a guillotine. A little excessive? Not at all I hated this game and truly wished I had not even considered playing it. I usually have a requirement for my reviews; 50 hours play-time for full games, and 25 hours for Alphas, Betas, indie, and small title releases. I was not applying that rule to this failure, seeing that I gave up within two minutes. Realized steam needed at least five minutes to write a review so I put the game on and threw on some random video to pass the time.  I did not want to put 25 hours into this game, I only wanted to drain the blood out of my ear, after playing this ear abuse. The shooting is awful and when you can actually get the gun to fire your ears explode as if the gun was shooting in your ear not the game. The music is way too dull and it sounds as if it is either a loop or a 300 year long disease growing into your ears. I can’t really find a single positive in this game. The controls are fairly basic and pretty easy to learn. Shooting is the worst thing I have ever seen you aim in diagonals, you never hit a shot on a zombie even when your gun is in their body as they obliterate your tiny pixel commando. I can hardly see a story, or any type of narrative. The game is a main menu and that’s it. You press start or just wait till it starts on its own. The game throws you in the Microsoft paint texture map that the main menu is painted onto the floor making you wonder if this is the game or a very long and inferior loading screen.\n\nIt’s hilarious how underdeveloped this game is. Zombie Zoid is such an abomination of a game that the developers can't even be bothered to spell the title consistently. The title screen calls the game "Zombie Zoeds" and that is also its name on Steam, but some promotional material for the game such as Steam's trading cards refer to the game as Zombie Zoids. The game has a team that must have thought that this anathema was a masterpiece and brings something new to gamers. Not only is the game awful, but why zombies? We have at least a million trash zombie games, ill name a few bad zombie releases; Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler's Green, Burn zombie burn, ZOMBIE ZOEDS, Zombie Fort, The War Z, Infestation: Survivor Stories. That’s just to name a few, trust me I can go on and on with these terrible zombie games.\nIm done wasting my time with this atrocious zombie game, I mean c’mon who played this and thought this was amazing and thought that it deserved to be released.\n\nMy final ruling is a 1/10. One of the worst games I’ve ever had the displeasure to play.\n","December 25, 2015","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
