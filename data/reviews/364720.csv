You control 2 characters Ronald Reagan , 40th president of the United States of America and Mikhail Gorbachev, the 8th General Secretary of the Soviet Union with plenty of flavour text and political digs throughout the in between level 'cut scenes'.\nYou are both abducted during peace talks in Iceland and must work together to escape the terrorists and foil their plot with Gorbachev's KGB know how and Reagan's action man heriocs. There are some nice game play interactions, your currently unused character can be called over as a sentry who auto shoots after you unlock/hack doors and some stealth elements requiring carefully timed switching between characters.\nKeep in mind you get one shot at each level, if one of your characters dies then you immediately start the level from scratch. The levels are a good size and offer a variety of different challenges with most of the guards weaponry randomised giving you unique options on some playthroughs. I haven't played the co-op mode with another player yet but I imagine it would be even more fun strategising on the fly to overcome the enemy. I recommend Reagan Gorbachev to players interested in a politically themed twin stick shooter with puzzle and stealth elements.","February 24","true","2.7"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","97","32","33","6","0"

However, they get kidnapped by militant extremists, and now they have to cooperate to stop the terrorists from starting a nuclear holocaust.\nThe game features quite a lot of satire, and the bantering during the cutscenes between the two leaders is really enjoyable, especially if you know a thing or two about the Cold War. The story also gets quite interesting, with some really fun twists that will keep you engaged throughout the entire experience. Plus, at the end of each chapter, there is a trivia question about either Reagan or Gorbachev, and while it doesn't change anything gameplay related, it's a fun little addition that I really appreciated. The more you know...\n\nGRAPHICSThe game's top-down perspective works very well, and the characters look pretty good. However, the environment tends to get very repetitive after a while, and going through labs and weapons storages for the entire game makes everything feel a little bit shallow.\n\nGAMEPLAYWhile this might look like an Hotline Miami rip-off, it has many differences that makes this its own beast. First of all, the entire game can be played with a friend by your side, and I highly recommend it. Reagan's main weapon is a katana and he can lockpick red doors, while Gorbachev carries poisoned darts and can hack computers, and both of them can pick up weapons such as silenced pistols, shotguns, rifles, rocket launchers...\nThe other difference is the level structure: in some levels you will have to face many enemies to get to the end, in others you have to control stealth your way through traps, and some levels even feature so called "puzzles" (which means they can only be completed in one specific way). This adds a lot of variety to it, even though I mostly preferred the action and stealth levels.\n\nCHALLENGEPlaying this game alone is hard. And frustrating. Especially frustrating. The "puzzle" levels tend to get really tedious, and others feel really unfair, making me hate myself for playing this game. However, with a friend by your side everything is a lot easier, and I started enjoying this way more. And yeah, you also die from just one hit.\n\nSOUNDThe sound effects are really good, and the tecno music is just fine. But don't expect any Hotline-inspired music, you will be very disappointed.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThere are 32 short but hard levels to complete, many trivia questions to answer, and 11 achievements to unlock. However, you will probably finish this in 3-4 hours and won't come back to it.\n\nOverall, this is a nice change from the Hotline Miami formula, with a satiric story and good cooperative gameplay. However, there is much frustration to be found and the level design tends to get boring and repetitive quite fast. Highly recommended if you have a friend to play it with locally.\n\nStory: 8\nGraphics: 7\nGameplay: 8\nChallenge: 8.5\nSound: 7.5\nReplayability: 7.5\n\nENJOYMENT: 7.5\nFRUSTRATION: 8\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\nJoin my Steam group","March 3","true","2.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xl9/recommended/364720/","xl9","[TR] Xl9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xl9/","648 products in account","Reagan Gorbachev was reviewed with a code provided by the developer.\n\nReagan Gorbachev has a premise unlike any other. Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev are kidnapped during a peace summit, and must team up to take down the terrorists that captured them and a strange AI hellbent on causing a thermonuclear war. They solve this with neurotoxin, a katana, and lots of bullets from a top down perspective. It’s a concept so simple that it’s hard to find a way to screw it up, yet Reagan Gorbachev manages to find a way.\n\nTo put it bluntly, Reagan Gorbachev is not a good game. It is a top down action/stealth shooter with obvious inspirations from the fantastic Hotline Miami, but it takes the formula and scrambles it into a mess of bad graphics, sluggish gameplay, and terrible controls. Every time I died, I found myself wanting to quit the game and just do anything else. There is nothing to keep you going, besides the fact that knowing that with every level conquered, the end draws closer. When the mid-level trivia sessions on Reagan and Gorbachev is more entertaining than the main gameplay, then you know there’s a serious problem.\n\nRead the full review here: http://techraptor.net/content/reagan-gorbachev-review-fun-interrogation","March 3","false","4.4"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gymleaderheather/recommended/364720/","gymleaderheather","heatherjrock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gymleaderheather/","26 products in account","In 1986, Reagan and Gorby (as I’m now calling him) met in Iceland at the Reykjavik Summit to discuss nuclear weapons. We find our heroes in the middle of the negotiations (they even illustrated the historic photo – I nerd squealed when I saw it) when suddenly – gasp – they are kidnapped by militant extremists. They are now forced to work together to escape from their captors and save the world from nuclear Armageddon (in case you’re wondering, this is the part where it didn’t actually happen).\n\nYou control both Reagan and Gorby and must guide both of them to the exit. This is where the game’s small nuances get kind of fun in a nerdy sort of way; for example, Reagan, who was basically the Crypt Keeper when he was elected, moves slower than the younger, more lithe Gorby. Not much slower, mind you, but it is noticeable. Reagan also picks the locks on red doors and wields a katana, being a BAMF and all. Gorby, with his signature wine stain forehead, is slightly more agile and can hack green doors. His default weapon is a dart gun with the “KGB’s deadliest poison” which can kill “in less than a second”. Both can wield more destructive weapons such as hand guns, guns with silencers, and, my personal favorite, the RPG.\n\nRead the full review at: http://opnoobs.com/review/reagan-gorbachev","March 25","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
