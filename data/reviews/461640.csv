However I gave this one a shot...\n\nAt first, I clicked on the game because of the animu picture. Once I heard the cheasy background music for the intro I laughed for a little, but decided to watch through it. Let me tell you that it was worth it. The game was $.89 when I got it as it was on sale for 55% off.\n\nThe game feels like a classic RPG, and definately brings you back to the olden days of RPG - the ambiance, battle system, storyline, characters, and even the text boxes are reminiscent of some sort of Final Fantasy/Pokemon crossover. I personally love this game right now, especially for the insanely cheap price.\n\nIf you have a few quarters left over from buying whatever it is you are buying, I'd definately recommend this game.\n\nPROS-\n-Pretty good storyline\n-Good characters and character development\n-Fun and interesting battle system - active and somewhat challenging to be honest\n-Not a lot of glitches from what I've seen\n-Very cheap game\n-Your brother is a demon-cat thing\n-Nostalgia inducing\n-Pretty funny game\n\nCons-\n-A bit short\n-If you are even remotely near a demon (enemy) they will find you and attack you, Liam Neeson style.","May 14","true","0.4"," 87 of 136 people (64%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","64","87","136","28","0"

Some of the flashbacks contains surprising revelations that totally change my perception of the protagonist and antagonist. You also play flashback of different characters each with their unique point of view and you get to understand their rationale of why they did certain things.  I would say that the developer of this game is really a Master Story Teller.\n\nThis game is defintely not the mindless hack and slash RPG Maker story.\nIt is also not the typical demon-destroy-the-world and you-destroy-the-demon story that is repeated in many rpg games. I would give the plot a A++.\n\nAs for the downside, a few of the Steam Achievements are not working.\nHowever, the developer is actively trying to fix them and release patches of the game whenever he found a solution.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is defintely worth the $0.89. I would even pay $9.99 for this game as it is better than many of the RPG Maker games that is selling at this price. I own more than 50 RPG Maker games, and I know this genre very well. Good job, developer.","May 20","true","39.8"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","24","29","2","0"

Their quest takes place in a fictious Samurai-era Japan.\n\nSo far the main story has been progressing steadily in a pretty linear fashion. There are small sidequests that the player will have to discover on their own; there are no special indicators on the NPC that offer those, however some will be quite obvious to find and others just by randomly talking to. Actual conversations are pretty spot on and always stay on topic, no unnecessary babbling and/or vulgarities.\nWhile traveling to the different locations enemies will always be visible as there are no random encountes. Most of the time it is even possible to outrun enemies, because they will start to follow you for a bit once they spot you.\nBattlesystem is relying on ATB (active time battle) which should be familiar to anybody who has played some Final Fantasy games before. While it is turn-based at its core, player and enemy will be able to perform actions once their ATB bar fills up. Enemies won't wait their turn, but do so the moment they can. Battles themselves have been fairly easy so far, just keep an eye on your health bar and a few health items stocked and you won't be having any real problems.\nPlayer levelling and enemy difficulty itself feels very well balanced.\n\nOverall I can say that this is a nice little JRPG style game that may not bring anything new to the table, but since nothing seems to be broken, you always have the feeling of making some progress and for the price of admission you can do a lot worse, is worth a recommendation. Especially newcomers to the genre will find a nice starting point here as it always clear what you are supposed to do and where to go next!","May 15","true","11.6"," 35 of 62 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","35","62","0","0"

I would highly recommend this game for those who like a bit of a throwback on their plate mixed with a heaping dose of nostalgia.\n\nPROS:\n-A simple objective for a player. With an ultimatum goal in his mind.\n-Deep mired character that unravels as you go.\n-COOKING! Normally seen in those TALES games. Its a refreshing change of pace in a top down RPG.\n-Witty cutscenes that you have to watch.\n-Journals: So you can keep track of what you are doing in the game and not get confused where you left off. This is huge and paramount to RPG's nowadays. It definitely helped.\n\nCONS:\n-Lack of customization: No way to improve stat's via equipment change or getting new weapons or add ons. I have played this game for a bit and have yet to see such things.\n-COOKING: It only heals health. No strength bonuses. No stat bonuses. Just health.\n-May possibly be a short game.\n\nAll in all: 8.5/10\n\nThis is one of those flawed masterpieces that one shouldn't overlook. There may be those flaws as stated above, but the gameplay and story overshadow some of these. This is probably the programmer's first attempt at such a game. Maybe, maybe not. But I am eager to see future works from whomever made this. I would give you a round of applause. This game has captured me.\n\nIt is a compelling story. One worth taking the journey on.","May 19","true","10.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

The memory 'game-scenes' were kind of long and didn't make me want to play them much since I knew any levels gained wouldn't be retained, but it was fun to actively interact in them.

There are interesting things about the plot but the main characters feel so cliche I didnt even want to give it a second chance. Nothing hooks me at the start of the game. It felt boring and a bit of task to play.

(Cause no surprise elements or new/good equip for heroes).\n\nThe next is getting you to backtrack here and there to places for at least a few times in main story. (side quests too).\nThe battle system, overall is okay, but the miss rate is kind of frustrating at times, (Especially if you used a high TP skill) you can miss  or enemy took no damage.\n\nOverall, I recommend it due to the low pricing and good story for this game.\n\n\n\n","May 26","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It hardly reinvents the wheel, but if you liked Final Fantasy 4, 5, 6, or The After Years... you'll enjoy this game. Just be sure to look at the screenshots to make sure you understand what you're getting before you buy it.\n\nWithout spoiling too much, this is a game that includes a lot of cheesy Japanese culture references, along with a few mythological references and some plot twists that might remind you of Star Wars. You can tell the game was created by someone who plays games, and there's even a house in the first town where three guys are having a very typical argument that you hear among nerds. The game often feels surprisingly light-hearted and self-critical of JRPG tropes, although it gets darker near the end.\n\nHowever, don't sit around level grinding too much. Let's just say that there's only about 20 hours of gameplay here, and if you go much past level 20, you completely mess up the difficulty curve and make the main game really easy. Also, a lot of the more difficult sequences take place in the past and force you to use different characters than usual, effectively negating the effort you put into grinding. So really, just don't do it.\n\n","May 21","true","19.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Your story telling is good. You have a good pace, I felt comfortable reading and enjoyed learning about the characters. Shinto really grew on me, especially how he sat on Kenshi's head.

Find a new track or improve that one.\n\nI recommend this game! It's a good story and solid gameplay! Don't be fooled that it's it's an rpg maker game so you think it won't be any good.

The main characters receive some nice development along with some of the lesser side characters. The combat system might take some time to get acquanted with, but it is much more entertaining than others of this genre. There is even a neat cooking system to help support players throughout the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/itswampa/recommended/461640/","itswampa","Its Wampa!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/itswampa/","72 products in account","Let me start off by saying I was very pleasantly surprised by this game. I find it very difficult to find myself enraptured by games these days, outside of primarily the Souls series. So when I was browsing the store, the picture caught my eye, but as I read up on reviews for this I decided I wanted to try it out. Perhaps I would find something that would capture my attention the way every game used to when I was younger.\n\nBoy, was I right.\n\nI will be blunt. The story is not original, though that does not mean it isnt interesting. The art design is extremely familiar, given that many people will be reminded of their days playing pokemon. However, the intense combat learning curve (which at first feels like a wild rollercoaster ride with no safety harness, but then gradually turns into a race that challenges your reflexes) was incredibly stimulating.\n\nI also enjoyed a great portion of the dialogue. For example, (this is a generic encounter, in now way related to spoilerific content) there is a house in the main city that you can go into. Inside there is a gentleman. If you approach him and speak to him, the only thing he says is "Get out of my house." Its such a simple line, and yet I found myself laughing hysterically at the proposition of having a character give me such a realistic response in a game that is anything but. Remember all those houses you just randomly entered in pokemon to try and find stuff because you felt like it? How many times do you think youd be told "Get out of my house" in real life if you did the same thing? Its little things like that that turn something plain into something charming and captivating.\n\nThe characters werent the most impressive bunch, but there were a few who stuck out as well thought out.\n\nThis game isnt particularly great at anything, but the overall experience is.... satisfying, and endearing.\n\nYes you may have to grind, but there are loops and tricks you can use to dramatically decrease the time spent grinding,if you're clever. Is it worth it? Absolutely.\n\n10/10 would play again","May 20","true","12.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It was also a good idea to make the enemies wander instead of randomly encountering them; they also chase you down once they spot you. It is also nice that there is a cooking system in the game, but you would only use it if you don't have enough yen(money) to buy items from shops. On the store page is says that the entire game should be approximately 13 hours, but I finished it in 08:49:39; probably because I was lucky in most of my battles. I believe the battle system is fair and justified, so I won't talk about it much. Although, you must have a bunch of healing items or else your entire team won't survive in tough battles. The missions won't give you experience, but items and yen. In the entire game you'll only have 3 other party members; they are Shinto, Kaiya, and Jiro. All of them including the main protagonist, Kenshi, are unique. What makes this game decent is not the battle system, but the story. The story is actually interesting and it obviously has to do with the 7 deadly sins; there are many twists too, and I was surprised a couple of times.\n\nIn ConclusionThis game made in RPGMaker is actually decent; honestly, I really liked it. I won't deny that this game does use some of the basic stuff from RPGMaker, but I can tell that there was some actual effort put into this game. The game is full of sadness, romance, and comedy. Shinto being the comedy relief. This game does a good job story-wise. I would like to say that the developers did a good job, and hopefully they can make another decent RPG.","May 22","true","10.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The combination of an active fighting system with menu-driven system is just frustrating.  Simple attack is easy, but trying to select a spell or item from the right character while in the heat of battle is ridiculous.  Healing is virtually impossible.

But when you look at what it's about and how it runs, you just don't feel like it's a game worth your time. I personally found the story to be subpar at best, with an artstyle that's unoriginal to say the least. Some people may say that the artstyle is somewhat classic, but i do not share that train of thought. The best thing in this game for me, is the music. The music sounds decently pleasant and is actually not too bad. This is an RPG though, which means you are going to have to put a lot of time into it to get the the finish line. This means that the game needs to be even better then a lot of it's peers in other genres, since it has a lot to say, over a long period of time. So you need to almost play it through to get some kind of satisfaction when it comes to the story in particular. This game as i said in the beginning is not a really bad game at all. But since there are so many better games out there in the genre, i just can't find it in my heart to recommend you to use your money or your time on this game when you could have spent it on something better.

And guess what:\n\nIt's a pretty awesome game.\n\nBefore you start blaming on the RPG Editor graphics, let me explain first. When I started playing the game, I didn't expect too much from it. But since I received the game as a gift, I thought I would give it a try. I had the same feeling like you would have right now at the first few minutes of the game, but I decided to continue playing.\n\nAnd I'm glad I did.\n\nThis is not just a ''simple RPG created in an editor to make some easy money'', although the graphics might express that. But the looks of the game are misleading, because the true potential of this game lies deeper: The story.\nThe story of Kenshi and his demon cat is told in such a good way, with plot-twists and jokes in all corners of the game. There is just so much dialog put into these lovely characters that you know that this RPG isn't something made to exploit you, but to enjoy you, to make you laugh, to make you cry, but most important: to let you have a good time. And that's a big plus for me.\n\nOf course, story isn't everything. Apart from the story, the rest of the game is pretty ''okay'' in the sense that it isn't perfect, but it does the job. For exemple, the combat system is pretty cool with all the different classes you find during the game, but it's pretty basic (apart from the fact it's a semi-real time combat system). So are the graphics and the exploration. It's not perfect, but it still creates the atmosphere needed for a nice RPG like this.\n\nTo summarise my review: This RPG is pretty basic in a lot of aspects, but the story is beyond extraordinary. And I think that is the most enjoyable aspect of this game and a RPG in general. It just helps to fill the atmosphere so much. The rest of the game definitely has potential to be improved here and there (the devs work on it.), but in its current state it's still one of the best games I played in a while, especially for this price.\n\nScore: 7.9/10","May 14","true","10.6"," 23 of 57 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","23","57","3","0"

A RPG maker game that I definantly did enjoy and was a good price for a short fun game. The story is pretty simple. In the world of Lanistra a demon (being naturaly evil) cursed the world before being snuffed out by princess Asuki. That anyone who really really commits to a sin, becomes that corrusponding demon. Lust, Greed, Gluttony, Envy, Wrath, Pride and Sloth. The world is now just coverd with these once human. now demons and they find and attack you pretty dilagently through out the game.SO. You play as Kenshi, a demonhunter swordsman and his brother Shinto, a demon cat... Yes and then you pretty much get the story and idea that like Full Metal Alchamist you are  to try to find a way to return Shinto from demon cat to human. Travel from town to town, searching for this cure while killing baddies demons and helping citizens out with a pretty comic routine bewteen the two brothers. Kinda of a modern Marvel comic, kid friendly jokes and hi-jinks. The game music is a little generic for RPG maker games and isnt the most uplifting upbeat for this type of game. There is also just 2 characters you play as instead of the get 5 friends or a huge party to advance through the game. Diffrent yes, not bad and there is no gear. NO weapons or armor to upgrade or sell/trade/find. Witch I look forward to in my RPG game. Again, not bad just diffrent, because the items and such deal more with the real gimick of the game. COOKING. yes, all food network fans will love this part. Find recipes and food like items to create meals in the crafting part of this game. The food gives you buffs, health and such and are made when you find the right kitchens around the game. Kenshi in game loves and talks and yes food and cooking is an interesting part of the game. Witch is fun and keeps the game different. Grab it and play. ! cook and kill ! oh and change your bro back into a human...","May 14","true","1.9"," 9 of 39 people (23%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","23","9","39","3","0"
