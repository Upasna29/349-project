Don't get me wrong, I understand why people like the game but it just was not for me. With the Escapists I missed depth and story which this version of the game has.\n\nThe Escapists: The Walking Dead is a fun game if you enjoy the Walking Dead. In this game you take control of Rick Grimes and you have to make sure you save everyone from the zombies. Instead of having to make sure your heat level is low for the guards which was never a big issue, NOW IT IS!!! If the zombie meter gets too high zombies will walk inside your perimiter causes a lot of damage/trouble. So this game causes you to think more about what is best for you and the other survivors then just trying to escape.\n\nI think this version of the game has more depth story wise and the way you play the game. You have to make sure morale is high otherwise characters might go crazy :)\n\nJust in short: If you like the escapists but want a bit more variety in game play and a more in depth experience, then you should play this game :)","September 30, 2015","true","8.4"," 218 of 290 people (75%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","75","218","290","23","1"

I've found a few interesting items though no idea and hints how to craft them so far.\nThe game daily respawns loot inside containers (so literally next to your bed - survival, yay), so the only motivations you have to go out is to find the damn key that prevents you from progressing.\n\nAnd the level design is horrible. Long roads that make the short amount of time between routines even shorter, rooms you can get trapped in and have to reload a save, and those damn locked rooms that can only be entered with the right key that is hidden somewhere. I constantly get the feeling that everything has been designed for length instead of fun.\n\n\nTL;DR - Prison break mechanics don't make for a fun survival game.\nIf you haven't played "The Escapists" get it instead.","October 2, 2015","false","7.5"," 178 of 246 people (72%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","72","178","246","13","6"

Music is cool, and the 8-bit atmosphere is very well crafted.\n\nThe tutorial could do with a bit more work; originally I picked up the first zombie and carried her around until I worked out how to drop her. The controls are a bit too simple: the same button which means "attack" also means "carry" and "drop".\n\nOnce past the first bit of the first level, however, I could not progress. I need to fire a gun in order to proceed, but the gun cannot be fired. The tutorial is clear on what I need to do (press right-button or SPACE to aim and left button to fire). Pressing space works just fine, and the zombie gets targetted. However, pressing the left button then does nothing. Not a thing. I spent about ten minutes trying different combinations, verifying the controls section of the pause menu, and trying to use both buttons at the same time rather than SPACE. Both buttons at the same time may not work on the mousepad for this laptop, but SPACE and left-button should work. It doesn't.\n\nI hope this gets fixed soon, because this does look like  fun little game, and I am a huge fan of the TV show.\n\n**EDIT** The guys at Team17 saw this reviw and contacted me via comments very quickly. An email exchange followed. That's great support, guys. Well done! Sadly, my issue is not resolved, but I could continue play using a USB mouse. My tests found that it appears to be an issue with Windows 10 and/or DirectX. Other games turn out to be affected in an identical way.\n\nI progressed to level 2, and this does look like a fun little game. I will be playing it more when I get access to a USB mouse on a regular basis.","October 1, 2015","true","2.0"," 55 of 71 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","55","71","6","2"

I was stupid enough to buy this game the day it came out because I enjoyed playing escapists and i'm a fan of the walking dead but this game is EXTREMLY random in it's time line! first, you start at the hospital in the beginning of the chapter "days gone by", THEN your already at the farm, THEN your already at the jail! I mean come on! also the game tried too much to be like escapists and not enough walking dead, I'm wondering why Rick has to do tedious chores in a zombie apocalypse! like not washing peoples underwear is going to cause zombies to start showing up. I like the way they replaced the heat meter for the zombie meter but it only goes up when you don't do chores, maybe if the chores were like "patch the holes in a fence or scavenge around the map for ammo and supplies" but no it's wash clothes and garden... I also hate the fighting mechanics, it's IMPOSSIBLE to fight a zombie one on one, even if you have a weapon its so hard to attack, the fighting style is neither escapists or walking dead I know because all you had to do in escapists is click and it goes into auto fight mode, also i've seen Andrea take down a zombie with a screw driver and glen with his hands tied behind his back in one episode, why can they handle zombies like that in the game?! I did rather enjoy the idea of collectible comics hidden on every stage but they had to ruin even THAT by making you unable to read them! WHATS THE POINT OF OWNING COMICS YOU CAN'T READ!?

Personally, I think this game could do with some many improvements and bug fixes. To make things clear, I'll use the Pros and Cons List.\n\nPROS\n-Unique Concept\n\nCONS\n-Buggy Tutorial\n-Strange Controls\n-Graphics (I'll talk about this later)\n-Tutorial Lacking Vital Information\n-Wonky Combat System\n\nThat's it for the pros and cons, now to explain why I chose the cons.\n\nBuggy Tutorial: Your clicking on stuff the game tells you to click on is pretty much random if you actually perform the action. As an example, I kept clicking with the shovel in the underground section to dig straight up, on the 100th or so click, it finally worked.\n\nStrange Controls: In the original 'The Escapists', you had to open a menu to equip clothes and weapons, and I liked that. In this game, you have to select the weapon in your hotbar, and press 'E' to equip it. Another strange control change, to stand on desks in the original game, you just had to walk into it. Here, you must press 'F' to stand on the desks. You also use 'F' to give NPCs items. What happened to the give mechanic?\n\nGraphics: I'm so going to get screamed at for this... The graphics look like someone took them straight from the Xbox One version of the original game. Oh wait... What I'm trying to say here, is that I want the graphics to look more like 'The Escapists' on PC. Save these ones for the Xbox One release.\n\nTutorial Lacking Vital Information: The tutorial lacks information on the Threat Meter, the Health Meter, and the Energy Meter. These are important. I kept wondering why people won't follow me when I clicked on them. (Because that's how you make them follow you. What happened to the 'Q' key? Oh wait, they used that to dismiss people. Wow.)\n\nWonky combat System: In this game, the combat system is like if Team Fortress 2 was 2D. There's no Lock-On like in the original game, and there's barely any feedback that you actually hit an enemy. (Besides a quiet noise, and a tiny health bar below.)\n\n\nThat's it for my review, I'll list the score below, but before that, I want to say that If Team17 updates this game in any way that will make me change my review, then I will.\n\nMY SCORE FOR THE ESCAPISTS: THE WALKING DEAD IS... 39%","October 3, 2015","false","0.1"," 69 of 121 people (57%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","57","69","121","10","6"

I had this game at the top of my wish list for quite some time and managed to pick it up during the Steam Exploration Sale for $8.99. My only main issue surrounding this game is the fact that this is not worth the original $19.99 price. Even $8.99 for this game is still fairly stiff.\n\nI say this because I feel the price for the content provided is worth maybe $4.99. There are 6 (?) levels that span all across The Walking Dead universe (comics/TV show) and that's about it. There is no co-op, no online play, nothing. Just a linear single-player version of this. In my opinion, this just feels like a mod for the original Escapists game, which, to be fair it actually is a standalone mod.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, I really enjoy it as of right now, but I've heard from reviews that this game can get a little repetitive and has a lot of unnecessary actions. I can agree on the "unnecessary actions" part, because I think that not mending daily chores or going to meals shouldn't and doesn't result in more walker activity. That's just insane and not logical.\n\nIf you're a big Walking Dead fan who has read the comics or at least watches the show, you will DEFINITELY find this game fun and easy to understand. Otherwise, this game really punishes people who haven't read the comics.\n\nAs a conclusion, DEFINITELY get this game when it's on sale. I really think you'll be disapointed if you buy this for the retail $19.99 price tag. 7/10","December 3, 2015","true","1.1"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","18","28","2","0"

All the hype the trailer song that burns it's way into your brain what could go wrong? A lot could go wrong. There are a total of three actual levels in the game. The first two are more or less tutorials. Even if the game claims the second level isn't. The gameplay has the repitition of the first, but it doesn't work in the walking dead. As Extra credits once said "you can't have bioshock without plasmids is false" In this case it's the routines. Throwing in work periods meal times and roll calls just because "hey it's the escapists" doesn't work. Rather than feeling like your in danger and need to defend yourself. You feel like you need to slowly gather items and leave the map.

This game is exactly what it sounds like. They've taken the walking dead franchise and dropped it into the Escapists environment. Replacing prison life with life as a survivor living in a survivor camp. A lot of the same gameplay elements from the original are present.\n\nYou play the game as Rick Grimes. As i just mentioned, a lot of the gameplay elements will be familiar to those gamers who have played The Escapists. You've got a schedule to keep. Theres roll call, you have your meal times, some daily chores and of course you have free time which you can use to find and craft items and weapons. There are also tasks which you must complete in order to move to the next map.\n\nMuch like the gameplay,  the graphics and sounds are very similar to the original Escapists. In fact, the graphics even appear to be slightly improved. The control scheme also is improved upon from the original with a few slight changes. It is easy to say that, all in all, the actual basics of the game itself have improved.\n\nUnfortunately, the game just misses the mark. I enjoy the original Escapists much more than i have enjoyed this version. It simply falls short for me as a zombie survival game. The levels seem shorter and easier than they should be and there dont seem to be very many of them at all. It simply seems much....shallower than one would expect. This gamer simply cant justify a rating any higher than a 2.5 out of 5. This gamer advises waiting for that magical 66-75% off on a Steam sale before biting.\n\nHappy Gaming!!!","October 15, 2015","false","0.7"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","11","23","0","2"

If I wasn't as new to steam and was more aware of steams refund policy, (no more that 2 hours play refunds are invalid) I would have refunded it immediately as it took me 4 hours to get it to work.\nN.B Never leave the game running in the background, even if not actually any further than the play screen. It took me over the 2 hour return limit just to get the game to start running, and I was only on the Load page with no clickable features!\nAs I was past the point of being able to refund by the time I Instead I persited with the glitches that would normally accompany a free to play game or a beta version.  This is a great regret of mine as I only persisted because I had paid for it. Apparently I have played the game for 51.7 hours. I have actively played it for no more than 10, but Load screens, and back ground pauses count.... OF COURSE!\n\nI'm not going to comment like many have on the misleading nature of The Escapists brand compared to this, I don't have a measure for comparison. Personally I thought it was fine as a stand alone game if you like the style of game that require exploration rather than, games which challenge you to complete ASAP. Also this game is truer to the comics than the tv show. Which makes it interesting for me, though TV-only might dislike some missing charectors.\n\nBut the glinches and errors are constant. The lack of ability to save except when the evening hits means you can loose large amount of progress when a glitch happens. I have felt like i have repeated 50% of what I played due to having to restart. I know I have reapeated large segments.\n\nGlitches include:\n- Not loading. - It wouldn't load for a while.\n- Not closing - the amount of 'force closures' I have created is rediculas.\n- Charectors who follow, targeting mechanism appearing for no reason.\n- Charectors who will not stop following you for an extended period dispite dismissals.\n- Game failing to register daily tasks as complete, most notably evening head count.\n- Invintory box vanishing completley. (This stops you from preforming daily tasks)\n- left click fails to work, this prevents game saving at end of the day and all interaction with charectors.\n- Desks seem to 'lose' items when they are stored in them. I have 4 boxes of ammo dissapear on me.\n\nI cannot believe this game passed the beta test and was considered fit for sale with this number of errors.\nI am utterly fuming.\n\nIt is not worth the money.\n\nIt needs overhauling.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nDear Steam,\nYour refund policy is fundementally flawed if non-actve game play i.e load screens, count towards the total and prevent a refund. It is penalising people who have patience and try to resolve issues. All I have learnt to do is have a tantrum and demand a refund immediately when I have any small issue.\n\nP.S Thanks for giving me an interesting area of law to consider, I feel this has the makings of a Disertation for a Master of Laws.","October 12, 2015","false","52.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The title "The Escapist: The Walking Dead" makes this game come across as a shameless collaberative branding of two franchises that don't mix, and the tuotrial level hammers that in. Furthermore, I also thought that the "survival mode" was a good idea, but if you have a game that uses it as a selling point, you need to include a multiplayer co-op mode which (to my knowlage) this game does not have.","June 4","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
