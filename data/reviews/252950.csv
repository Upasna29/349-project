"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wrekkt/recommended/252950/","Wrekkt","Rekt.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wrekkt/","108 products in account","Rocket League has one of the best progression systems I've ever seen in a video game before...\n\nRookie - You can't hit ♥♥♥♥. You are a disgrace to your team and the game.\n\nSemi Pro - You can now sometimes hit the ball. Don't even try to hit it in the right direction or think about your positioning. You're only Semi Pro so you can just go ahead and hit that ball! You also made a bicycle hit that one time but yeah nah you're still ♥♥♥♥.\n\nPro - You have learnt how to shoot the ball accurately from the ground. You're the best! Late into Pro level, you would have likely looked up advanced tips for Rocket League. Worst mistake of your life. You now know what aerials are. You think you can fly. The ball comes up high and you go for an aerial. Once you jump, you fly straight into the ground and continue to do frontflips until you land on your back... What the ♥♥♥♥ happened there? Oh. You're using keyboard. Yeah nah, time to get a controller, ♥♥♥♥-head.\n\nVeteran - You now have a controller and go for terribly unlikely aerials. You think you're good. You can hit the lower aerials consistently and you can now be considered an addition to your team. Congratulations!\n\nExpert - You can now consistently hit aerials accurately at any height. This game is now your life. You can also score off a wall every now and then. Good times.\n\nMaster - You are now a god to every level lower than you. You have perfected the art of wall shots. You are an extremely cool person. A nice little bonus is that everyone under the level of Pro will now spam "Sorry!" every time they do something wrong to you.\n\nLegend - The most badass-looking title you can have. ♥♥♥♥ Rocketeer. You probably now have an extreme case of false confidence. Once you get used to the badass title, you'll wreck anything and anyone with ease. You can also pull off freestyles consistently. Nice job! Also be sure to prepare for an endless stream of "You're not good enough for Legend!"\n\nRocketeer - You can now 720-freestyle-backflip-reverse-backwards-aerial-air dribble off a wall with ease. You probably boosted for that Rocketeer tag, but if you didn't: Still prepare for another endless stream of "You're not good enough for Rocketeer!"\n\nBut in all seriousness, I absolutely love this game and I'm sure anyone will. I've literally never seen someone dislike this game after they've played 10 hours. (Rocket League moves onto a whole-nother level of fun and addiction once you learn how to fly.)\n\nIf you're still contemplating buying this game after reading this review, just trust me when I say it is one of the most fun and addictive games I've ever played (more gripping than Skyrim and GTA).\nThink about it this way: You wouldn't have made it this far through the review if you didn't secretly want this game. Ignore the childish-looking pictures on the store page. Just get this game. This is the one.\n\nEDIT - 2/13/2016: You know a game is amazing when the servers go down and you'd rather train offline than play any of your other 100 games...\n\nty for the read","January 11","true","489.8"," 2,840 of 2,969 people (96%) found this review helpful 1,525 people found this review funny","96","840","2","525","85"

But 60 is just swell)\n• Supports In-game voice/text chat\n• Low ping (Make sure to select your region in the server filters)\n• Clean Interface\n• Cross platform\n• Smooth Gameplay\n• Customizable cars (You can even give them hats!)\n• In-game replay recorder (Just hit "save replay" after any match)\n• Incredible visuals\n• Controller support (The game suggests to use a controller, but honestly, the keyboard works perfectly. All preference)\n\nGame Cons\n• (All previous cons have been fixed. Please leave a comment with a "con" if you have one)\n\nRelateable Games\n•  Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Power Battle-Cars\n\nConclusionRocket League is an amazing game. You know those games that you play while you should be going to bed? That's this game. Only 90 minutes into the game, and i've already had so much fun with it.

(To be honest, it usually ends up in "one more match" multiple times. That's how it's good.)\n\nThe game is easy to learn and just fun to play. Making the perfect aerial shot, passing to a goal, saving the ball from reaching your goal at the last possible moment, failing hard and scoring an own goal... These are all moments you will see in Rocket League.\n\nAre you in a mood for tactical game? Play 2v2. Do you want chaos? Play 4v4.\n\nI love car customization.

To do those insane aerial maneuvers, you'll need quite some training.\n\nThe Main Motivation comes from being a competitive game, either via ranked games or normal matches against other players. There is also a single-player mode, but that's more for practicing and getting into the game than a selling point for the game.\nYou can also unlock stuff for your car, like hats, booster color, tires and patterns to put onto your car.\n\nI've never been a big fan of either genre, yet Rocket League manages to pull me in and gets me excited about every match i play. Even if you're playing with random people, it's not that bad and you can have quite some fun, though having a good team which is working good together would be the most fun.\n\nSo, hope to see some of you on the field :)","July 30, 2015","true","192.5"," 398 of 433 people (92%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","92","398","433","38","4"

In Rocket League you get behind the wheel of one of a number of different cars and face off against up to 4 opponents in an effort to hit a giant football in to the opposing team's goal. Enjoyable in solo play, local multiplayer and online matchmaking you can either play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 and even unbalanced matches! (only available in offline exhibition mode).\n\n+Great graphics and visual effects\n+A wide range of customisation options unlocked as you complete matches\n+There's a season mode if you wish to play solo so you don't have to just play exhibition games repeatedly, the season mode is actually pretty good and features a number of different options which make it more interesting\n+Local multiplayer supports up to four players (providing you have enough controllers)\n+A number of different maps, each with several time and weather variations\n+Cross-platform multiplayer with PS4 players (though the party system currently doesn't work when doing cross-platform matches)\n+Rocket League features some quick messages which get assigned to your controller's hat switch allowing you to communicate quickly with your teammates\n+You can save the replays of your matches to watch back later\n+Obviously it has full controller support for 360 controllers as well as Xbox One controllers and the controls are fantastic\n+It's even entertaining for those of us who aren't keen on playing sports games\n+Your car's top speed is considerably higher on a pitch made of tarmac compared to a grass pitch, it's not a major feature but it's certainly a nice touch\n+As mentioned earlier you can play unbalanced matches when playing offline exhibition, they provide and extra layer of challenge and are great fun when playing local multiplayer\n\n+/-The game's bots aren't great but this game is best enjoyed by playing multiplayer anyway\n\n-Solo play gets pretty repetitive\n\nVerdict:\nAn Essential Purchase (9.5/10)\n\nRocket League is an incredibly good multiplayer game with great visuals, lots of customisation options and a number of different maps. If you're looking for a new multiplayer game or just something a bit different, you've come to the right place.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","August 11, 2015","true","21.3"," 398 of 456 people (87%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","87","398","456","35","29"

I only played a couple of matches!)\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you are a racing/football fan or not. You’ll love it. This game appeals to both casual and competitive players. You will suck most of the time and sometimes score amazing goals and it would feel incredible! This is one of those games that is easy to learn and very hard to master. I am still horrible at it after 100 hours. The good thing is that it is still entertaining even if you are losing more often than winning.\n\nSo is it a great game? Hell, yes! Do I recommend it? No, unless you want to get sucked in and get addicted to this devil’s child of a game.\n\nI got it for free with Steam hardware. At this point I am ready to pay $20 just to get rid of it.

They worked day an night and now everything is working fine at least for me.\n\nSo, i played this game on Beta on PS4 and i was pretty hyped about the launch. It didn't disapoint. I have it for free on PS4 and bought it on steam to play with friends.\n\nThe game is a ton of fun. The gameplay is easy to learn, hard to master.\nGraphics are pretty nice and cars come with a ton of costumization options (FOR FREE).\nWe can face AI opponents with diferente skill levels (that can make a huge diference) or we can play vs players usually with simillar skill (sometimes u can face players really better than u but their in game rate is the same or lower than yours).\nThere are several game modes but the only major difference is the amount of players and ranked match or not.\nIts great to play with friends. Hard to quit playing even if you're really tired.\nI seriously recomend using a controller. I use my DS4 with Bluetooth (using inputmapper) and it works perfectly. For ppl using other controllers i recomend x360ce (helped 2 friend who were using a ds2 and a sega saturn controller).\n\nA word also for the devs that seem to work night and day to fix problems. Keep up the  good work.\n\nGreat game. One of the better for sure to release this year.","July 9, 2015","true","389.2"," 125 of 131 people (95%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","95","125","131","11","11"

You find yourself constantly saying 'Just one more game' over and over and over again because you literally cannot just put it down. It's simple: a car arena like showdown on a soccer field with one giant ball and a bunch of boost to fill your rocket powered dreams, but don't be fooled because this game is much deeper than it will originally look. Psyonix takes a very simlpe core idea and allows us to do whatever we want with it because of its purely physics based gameplay.\n\nWhat does this give us though? Let me tell you. Satisfyingly tight controls, action packed multiplayer, awe inspiring aerial goals, sniper tactics, competitive and casual matchmaking, hours of laughing and enjoyment, TONS of explosions (Mr. Torgue aproved), an incredibly balanced game, all future maps will be free, PC to PS4 crossplay, over 150 items for purely cosmetic customizations, and over 10billion of said combinations.\n\nI can really only say so much about the game itself (partly because English was my worst course :P) but what I really cannot stress enough is that you won't be staying for just the game alone. You'll be seeing Psyonix as one of the only developers left that actually understand what we want as well as falling in love with the community.\n\nThe community of Rocket League (and SARPBC for that matter) is probably the most open, friendly and supportive community I have come accross. Of course this is being said before release and I really hope that you new players please uphold our standard of ingame complements, willingness to help out anyone that wants to learn, and general good sportsmanship. If you find yourself running into a few bad apples, don't worry about it, as you climb up the ladder into the ranks with the rest of the long time players you'll notice the warmer atmosphere to say the least :)\n\nNow I suppose I should say that within the last week I've apparently played nearly 90hrs and that's just playing private matches with the same people constantly. Some would think that I'd be bored after that, but you'd be so so wrong. I can play all day, get into bed and watch some Rocket League videos, and then immediately want to play more (I may or may not be addictive :| but don't think you're immune).\n\nAnyways, I'm going to play some more Rocket League. I hope to see you on the field, and remember... Nice shpt! And never let the ball touch the ground (Rule #1)","July 7, 2015","true","335.8"," 172 of 194 people (89%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","89","172","194","11","7"

It is a sequel to the game SARPBC, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars and it is produced by Psyonix. It includes cross-platform play between PS4 and PC, having an huge playerbase currently.\n\nGameplay\n\nYou will have lots of fun with this game guaranteed! The controls are ultra-simple to use, you will get used to them in a blink of an eye. I play the game with a controller, which for me it is the best way to play it, but it is enjoyable to play with the keyboard + mouse too. The game itself is ultra fun! The ball physics with the rebounds and all feel impressively well, as the cars handling. It is incredibly easy to play, yet extremely difficult to master. You also have to use strategy in this game in order to win the matches, much like regular soccer. If you are just a ball chaser you will have difficult times winning, you have to think about your positioning and timing very well. You can also do incredible trick shots and jump shots due to your boost, which are incredible hard to master, but after some time you will start to get the hang of it. The worst part are some camera angles and the bots AI, but unless you plan on only playing offline games, the AI wont be much of a problem. It feels so good to make some incredible plays, even when you fail you will have tons of laughs. It is a very simple game with simple ideas, yet they work perfectly and make this game a blast to play for both casual and professional players.\n\nLongevity\n\nThe longevity of a game which relies on an multiplayer-focused game can be debatable, but in this one I am sure you will spend enough hours to compensate the money you spend in the game. At the moment I have spent 35 hours and intend to spend many more. You have tons of cars, paint jobs, hats and other customization stuff to unlock during the game that will keep you entertained for the first hours (I unlocked everything in around 20 hours). You also have 4 different game-modes (1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3, 4vs4) which give some good diversity since each one of the modes has its own strategies to follow in order to win them. You also have an offline season mode available to play, but it is kind of boring in my opinion given the multiplayer options you have. Practice mode is also available, a great place to tune your skills up. The ranks and leaderboards system will also entertain you, it is great to climb up against your friends in the diverse list of leaderboards available.\n\nGraphics and Presentation\n\nOnly have good things to say here too. By the moment you enter the game you will know you are in for something special. Slick menus with an ultra easy interface plus amazing songs will make you excited right at the first time you open the game. You got plenty of voice commands to use in-game which is definitely a plus presentation wise. Now the graphics. Another win in this spectacular game. Great graphics for a game this simple. All works really well, the colors, grass, car details, everything looks great. The level of detail in the cars and their customization objects is great too. These are some impressive visuals, even though the main focus of the game is definitely not the graphics.\n\nMusic and Sounds\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is amazing. I was totally not expecting it, there are really some great songs in it, got some of them stuck in my head. There are only around eleven songs in it, but most are awesome and don't get old. The various sounds in the game are also great, from the sounds of the different boost types, ball hits, drifts, crashes, everything works really well.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nThis is the big deal in this game. And oh boy, how fun it is to play it with or against friends. You will have tons of fun making the best goals ever as well as the biggest fails in history. It really gives you tons of laughs. You have also the option to play ranked instead of casual games, which make for some more intense, fun matches! The playerbase is huge, around 100000 players are online in most of the time, so you will find games in a matter of seconds. The community is in it´s majority very friendly, but like in all multiplayer games, you will find some toxic people playing the game too. You also have different server regions to choose from so you can play without worrying about lag. Unfortunately I did have some crazy lags in some european servers. It is rare to find a laggy server but it happens and can get very frustrating, specially when you are playing ranked. Yet, I am sure the devs will fix most of the server issues soon, so no worries about that.\n\nSummary\nPros:\nNewcomer-friendly gameplay, yet difficult to master\nGreat controls\nAmazing soundtrack\nGreat graphics and presentation\nAmazing multiplayer with lots of fast-paced, intense matches\nCons:\nThe Bots AI is pretty weak\nSome connection issues in multiplayer\nMy personal score: 9.0/10\n\nIf you enjoy high octane reckless driving and the world's most popular sport, Rocket League is for you. It is one of the most fun multiplayer games released in the last years. The base price is great value for the game you get, which will get you hours and hours of great fun! Embrace the latest gaming trend in Steam and PS4 and have a blast playing this soccer-meets-cars gem!\n\n----------------------------\nAnálise em Português no site eyeoctane.org / Portuguese Review in eyeoctane.org : http://eyeoctane.org/index.php/2015/09/30/analise-rocket-league/","August 30, 2015","true","362.0"," 424 of 531 people (80%) found this review helpful 59 people found this review funny","80","424","531","59","20"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrgeron/recommended/252950/","Arrgeron","Morse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrgeron/","602 products in account","Rocket League is a Football(Soccer) inspired sports game made by Psyonix. In this game you use a car to hit around a large ball into a goal, pretty much Football(Soccer) with cars. It might be the best game I've played this year so far.\n\nThere are a few different game modes, including online, Exhibition where you play against bots or your friends in local play, and a season mode where you play as a member on a team and you try and complete a season and win the championship. The game modes are fun, but not very different from each other. I do wish the Season mode was more like a Franchise mode in something like Madden, being able to control all the little things of your team, and having more stat tracking would make it a lot better, but its still worth a play or two.\n\nThe gameplay in this game is perfect. Once you figure out the flow to your car, how to use boosting properly, and how to track the ball, you'll realize just how addicing the game can be. Against bots or online, the game shines in its fun and addicting gameplay that adds a unique twist on the game of Football(Soccer). Learning the game comes quick, but mastering the techniques could easily take 30-50 hours of gameplay.\n\nYou have a large selection of cars and different things you can design them with. The speed and hitboxes are pretty much the same, so there isn't an optimal car to use, which is a great thing. All the different customization is basically cosmetic that does some minor stat tracking. I'm really happy they went this route, because you don't feel obligated to build your car based on some kind of metagame, you can customize it however you like it.\n\nBesides the season mode being kind of lacking, the only other complaint I had(notice, had), was the online. The first day I had it I couldn't play online at all, it just didn't work, and apparently until Saturday the online was pretty much broken. Thankfully, its been pretty much fixed, but I thought it would be an important point to mention. It is good that the developers showed commitment and actually fixed the problem, though.\n\nRocket League is an amazing game with addictive gameplay. I don't really get the people that say they don't like sports games, a lot of the gameplay and stat tracking in them is great, and this game is no exception. If your looking for a game to play with friends, or even by yourself that is very competitive based, or even if your just bored and looking for a game to risk $20 on, Give Rocket League a shot, its one of the best games to come out this year.\n\nPros:\n-Strong gameplay\n-Easy to learn, hard to master\n-Plenty of car customization\n-No car building meta, you can customize without worry\n-Encoranges teamwork\n-Reasonable asking price($20)\n\nCons:\n-Lacking season mode could use more stat tracking and player control\n\nBuy At Full Price","July 13, 2015","true","117.3"," 110 of 120 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","110","120","9","0"

Literally years. We've put thousands of hours into it. It's one of those incredibly rare games that all of us are always keen to play because it's always fun.\n\nRocket League, I'm happy to say, is SARPBC with improved graphics and gameplay, better accessibility for new players, plus a ton of added options that give the game an extra layer of character. It's going to comfortably replace SARPBC in my top five games, all-time, across all genres. It's also replacing SARPBC as my absolute favorite multiplayer game - online or local.\n\n\nPositive\n\n+ Fun, deep, brilliantly fast-paced gameplay\n+ Games are long enough to mean something, but short enough that a loss is never too frustrating.\n+ Games are almost never over until the final buzzer. Results can turn on a dime - and when they do, it's always because a player or team has stepped up, rather than any fault of or flaw with the game itself.\n+ The learning curve is fairly smooth, but the skill ceiling is also incredibly high. Despite the aforementioned years playing SARPBC, I still see players in Rocket League pulling off moves that I can only dream of.\n+ There's massive flexibility in how you play, more than any other game I know of. Offline with bots. Offline split-screen. Online. Online split-screen. Online split-screen with bots. 1 v 1 if you don't feel like playing on a team, or 2 v 2 / 3 v 3 / 4 v 4 if you do. And the game is just as suited to mano-a-mano matches as it is to team play, which is (again) a very, very rare quality.\n\n\nNegative\n\n- The one slightly disappointing thing I'll mention is (at launch) the lack of variety in maps. SARPBC had a bunch of quite inventive, distinctive maps that forced different play styles and tactics. Rocket League's maps are aesthetically different, but structurally uniform. Luckily, word is that some 'crazier' maps will likely be arriving in the forthcoming free DLC.  I'm still thoroughly enjoying what's already there, but some extra variety in that regard will definitely be welcome.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nIf the idea of fast-paced soccer (sans rules) with cars even vaguely appeals to you, get this game immediately. It's one I fully expect to still be playing - and thoroughly enjoying - years from now.","July 7, 2015","true","141.0"," 75 of 78 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","75","78","6","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/252950/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","This game is as addicting as FIFA soccer is. I do however recommend it with prudence. This game is action packed but can be seen simplistic by a few.\n\nI've played the game back in alpha and didn't much care for it. I like it now more than previously, which is an extremely good thing.\n\nRocket league is a soccer game played with RC cars. Obviously, the goal is to get the ball into the opponents net. Cars are given a few abilities to mix up the game. They can easily scale and drive on walls, and even up side down on the roof for a period of time (or longer with enough turbo). Boost or turbo is another feature in game. To acquire turbo, players must drive over small hot spots spread throughout the terrain. Some hot spots give minor turbo boosts while others will fill up the gauge all the way. Boosts when timed correctly, can produce a power hit on the ball. Some boosts when held down for a certain amount of time engage in some sort of ultra speed. When going this fast and if a player is in your way, you have the ability to literally run through and destroy the opponent.\n\nI am a huge fan of games which feature double jump, and rocket league has it! The first jump is a bit of a slow jump, while the second provides for another boost upwards. While in the air, the player can do a barrel roll leftward or rightward. This trick comes in hand when attempting to defend or attempting to knock the ball in an awkward angle. It can look pretty cool when done right. There are no power-ups within the games so this fact alone may turn a few people from the game. None the less, the devs probably wanted a simplistic approach to keep the game engaging. There is matchmaking available (which for the most part was done right) and local co-op which is extremely appreciated. Matchmaking is a bit funny to me in the sense where if only four players are available, it will add two AI's instead of allowing for a 2v2 vote. Again, it's not a big deal as empty slots are filled up with AI's (sometimes extremely annoying AI's that score on themselves). A neat feature is there is an arrow that indicates where the ball is off screen. Players can press Y to alternate the camera view off the car and toward the ball.\n\nGraphics are well done and nothing seems cut short. You can optimize for performance or quality (whoot whoot)! There are different stages in the game but they are limited. A few more "out of this world" stages would have been greatly appreciated. The customizations regarding the cars were absolutely well done. From custom paint jobs, custom wheels, to even custom hats that for some weird reason keep your goal count. One small complaint here : why not keep a separate leaderboard for assists and goals instead of having a weird hat keep count? They do, however, tell you how fast you were going when you scored. This I found to be a neat feature. The menu's and the UI was also well done and everything is kept simple and neat.\n\nThe game is quite exciting and cars seemingly fly everywhere. It's enjoyable when everyone crashes into the ball, but it is even more delightful when people start calculating hits and play positions.\n\nFor future Rocket League DLC's or games, it would be nice to see some mini-games! The main part of the game is excellent, but imagine adding some modifications to it. Perhaps adding power-ups could give an alternative to matchmaking.\n\nOverall good game, and I would recommend it to most people. There are a few friends that are reluctant to get into it, but for the most part it has received positive reception.\n\nRATING : 8.0/10\n\n\nGameplay	A	Story / Campaign	B	Visuals / User Interface	B	Sounds / Music	B	Replay-ability	A	Overall 	A\n\n\n\nPS - I figured out why it was so fun, you're essentially a flying projectile whenever you wish. When you get the hang of flying, this game's opportunities start flying wide open. Very simplistic game but you can definitely see the skill range of some players is phenomenal. Unlike FIFA where you would get discouraged, I'm sure you'll start challenging yourself when you see some of these crayz stunts.\n\nScreenShots :\nRiding upside down on the roof. There is an arrow to the left of my car to indicate where the ball is\n\nUsual start to a rocket league game\n\nYou can use your boost to fly through the air. You can also modify the color and type of boost that comes from the car\n\nComing in for a one timer at full speed\n\nAin't easy being the best","July 10, 2015","true","135.8"," 112 of 134 people (84%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","84","112","134","10","4"

Then you keep playing against people of the same skill, until you see someone who can do some cool/pro/funky/op stuff, then you see his goals and you think: "Wow, look at that shot, i must learn how to do it!"\nThen in a matter of time, you learn how to do it and even do better.

(The level "Pro" is just wrong, you probably aren't pro yet if you are there)\n\nThe matchmaker does its job well. Rather than your level, it takes your "skill" in consideration, so you will often play with people only slightly better or worse than you. This isn't bad, it is actually very good for you to learn and get better.\n\nCan i say anything more?\nNO item in the game gives you advantage over other player, all cars have the same speed and the only thing that changes is the hitbox, not a big deal when you learn the controls.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/252950/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1507 products in account","Rocket League is a well-made mix between racing and soccer genre. If you are subscribed to any of gaming Youtube channels or websites, you are probably already familiar with the game and you know that there is quite a lot of hype about it. And that hype is not unjustified.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You are in control of a car and your mission is to score enough goals to win the match with other players. You can play multiplayer (with actual people) or singleplayer (with bots). Also, there is a freeplay mode for you to sharpen your skills.\n\nPros:    The way this game looks is astonishing. Grass, cars, turbo effects, the ball, the arena ... they really look good. I mean, look at the Store page screenshots!\nMultiple game modes for both online and offline playing (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4). Ranked cannot be 4v4, however. If you play on "Unfair" difficulty against bots, you can also play 1v2, 1v3 and 1v4.\nThere is a tutorial in this game and unlike some other games, you can actually learn stuff from this one. For basic playing, there is a short tutorial just explaining how to move and jump, but if you have time and will to take your playing technique to the next level, this is taken care of by more advanced tutorials. This is probably one of rare games where you actually want to play tutorial multiple times.\nCar handling is near-perfect, it really goes where you want it to go. Also, you can drive one the walls, fly and even drive upside down on the arena ceiling for a short time.\nA very special thing in this game is so-called "Ball View", where camera is always pointing towards the camera. You can turn it on and off at appropriate times to maximize your efficiency while trying to hit the ball into opponents' net.\nCar customization content is absurd. You get hundreds of wheels, antennas, hats, car types ... you are guaranteed to find a combination that suits you.\nNext thing about car customization is how you unlock parts. This is the best way I've seen it handled: you get something for every single match you play. Yes, you've heard right. No matter what you play, with bots with real people, 1v1, you always get something.\nAfter playing every match, you also get a chance to save a replay of the game you have just played. These saved games can be then watched from perspectives of all players, there is also a free camera mode.\nMatchmaking seems to be working well, I've never been in a match that would be completely unfair or unbalanced.\nThe soundtrack is amazing, it consists of 11 songs that are also available on Amazon[www.amazon.com] and iTunes[itunes.apple.com].\nYou get XP even for playing with bots, but you get only 50% of you would get with playing online. Still, it's a great way to encourage people to play more. You also get some XP for losing.\nThis thing runs great even on old computers and you don't even have to have all the setting set to low!\nThe community is really active, there are almost five thousand threads created on Steam Discussions, there are tons of Youtube videos and streamers playing it.\nCons:    Only occasional lags when playing online. Also, sometimes servers are dead for a minute, but that only happened twice to me. Not a problem at all.\nThere is PS4 support, but no Linux and MacOS? Come on!\nThe final verdict:With practically no bad sides and tons of good stuff in this game, I certainly recommend it to everyone, not just fans of soccer or racing. I'm not a big fan of either of them, but I enjoy this game a great deal. You can customize your car in more than 10 billion combinations, the game really encourages you to play and the feeling when you play is amazing.\nThis is certainly one of the best games released this year. There are so many people playing all the time, there are streams, Youtube videos, tons of discussions, simply amazing. You can't be sure how long is this going to last for, so try grabbing it as soon as it gets any discount or even now, as it is certainly worth the full 20$ price tag.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

Yeah, you hear all the glowing reviews, but sometimes you need to experience it for yourself.  So I bought the game, on sale for $11.20 (USD), and was able to quickly find a friend to play with.\n\nThe first thing I did was try the tutorial, which impressed me on how tight and responsive the conrols are.  That was a really good sign for a sport where control is necessary.  Next we jumped into an match with easy bots and I scored a goal in the first 4 seconds.  OK, I was not expecting that to feel so satisfying.  That was the exact point that the hook was set.\n\nIt is not easy to score goals.  You wait back at midfield for the right time to speed burst towards a centered pass only to see it go wide or deflect off another player.  You circle back and try to attack again and again.  Time goes by, and then you find yourself colliding with a teammate and happen to bump into the ball that trickles just fast enough to cross the goal line before the opponent can fly over to stop it.  The feeling of triumph floods over you and you cannot stop your grin from growing over your face.\n\nI am not even 2 hours in at this point and I already see the promise this game holds.  The potential for great fun with friends is there, and that's the key.  I find myself looking forward to my next match.  I can't wait to get out there and drive around like a crazed lunatic and smash some buddies into the wall.","January 24","true","80.1"," 51 of 57 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","51","57","8","5"

There is more:\nEven though on the first look this game's concept appears simple and goofy, the depth of gameplay found here is insanely high. Rocket League is one of those games which allow you to do amazing plays and moves if you dedicated time and effort into it, but at the same time provide a lot of fun while played casually with friends.\n\n\nWhat to expect\nThis game is the sequel to the PS3 game Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars from 2008. Therefore the game idea isn't new and the gameplay doesn't differ a lot. But since the same developer Psyonix stay behind Rocket League, their experience allowed them to address problems and improve the game (as well as shorten the name :P).\n\nRocket League provides fast 5 minute rounds inside a box-shaped arena. The edges of the arena are curved to allow players to drive up walls and even on the ceiling. The team size can range from one to four players on each team.\n\nThe gameplay is fast and because of the playingfield's small size goals can be scored from the other side of it, since there are no obstacles in the way other than a potentional defending player. Blocking the ball and doing a counterattack right afterwards happens within seconds and can turn an entire game.\n\n\nThe cars\nThere are multiple car models to choose from, but their handling or top speed does not differ. Only the hitbox of the cars are slighly different - which creates some tiny variation in the ball interaction. However the main purpose of having multiple cars is to customize it without interfering or imbalancing the gameplay. This works very well and choosing a car is a personal preference rather than a statistical battle to determine which car is the best. The car customization comes with color, surface type, additional decal, wheels, antenna, goofy hats and particles for the rocket trail.\n\n"Rocket trail?" you may ask. Well, in Rocket League every car has a Rocket Engine attached to its back allowing to boost itself to greater speed. The best part is that you can jump and shoot yourself into the air with it and being able to fly. This creates gameplay in all three dimensions. Instead of just dribbling the ball on the ground, you can launch yourself into the air and hit the ball before your enemy can. It is not easy and adds a decent learning-curve to the game.\n\n\nThe experience\nThe game is very polished. The options menu allows key rebinding serparatly for keyboard and controller, very in-depth adjustments to the camera position/behaviour as well as a large choice of grafic options for the Unreal Engine 3.\nTextures are very detailed, particle effects very well made. The grass on the ground is fantastically animated. Even though the arena/stadiums are the same, there are four different theme versions, ranging from a raining indoor park to a full blown stadium with thousand of people cheering.\n\nThe cars handle very well, can turn fast and stick to the ground unless you want and tell them to drift. Once airborne keeping the control of the car or wanting to do what you want is difficult but not impossible. The physic engine of the game does it's work very well. The ball itself is predictable and doesn't behave random at all.\n\nYou unlock new parts for your car customization after completing each game - no matter the outcome of the match. The account progress is ok, but nothing incredible or important. This game shines when it comes to it's gameplay.\n\nThe sound effects as well as grafical effects while playing or just driving around are incredible enjoyable. Boosting to full speed makes you feel powerful, ramming people and even destroying them creates satisfing explosions. And when scoring a goal the ball explodes and creates a shockwave on which you can ride on with your rocket launcher. Directly afterwards you get a replay of the goal in slow motion. At the end of the game you can save a replay of the entire game and watch it whenever you want.\nSetting up goals and blocking the ball also feel rewarding by the system and on a team-spirit basis.\n\nSince the game has high skill ceiling, experienced players can crush any other ones. The matchmaking system works very well in that regard, that you get matched up with equally good players and even indicates if it doesnt find them and slowly extends it's skill range in order to find players as fast as possible. You can group up to play together in normal and ranked games.\nYou also have the choice of selecting multiple regional servers such as Europe, Oceanic, West- and East-America, as well as queueing up for multiple modes (e.g. 1vs1 and 3v3) at the same time. The game will put you in the first fitting game it can find for you.\n\nThe game also provides a singleplayer campaign against the AI, as well as tutorials and training for various parts of the game such as defending the goal and scoring goals. For those who just want to get used to the controls or test can hop into the sandbox mode.\nI also like to mention that you can queue up for an online game from any menu or singleplayer gamemode. So while searching you can play around in sandbox mode.\n\n\nDownloadable Content (Supersonic Fury DLC Update)\nAs announced by Psyonix, the first major update hit Rocket League. I first was disappointed that they want to go the DLC route. Not because i dont like to pay for content, but more because of the bad reputation the word 'DLC' has nowadays, fearing that Rocket League gets looked down for doing this markt strategie. But my fear should vanish.\n\nThe first DLC just includes two new car and customization items for a small price. The real update includes free stuff for everyone. New map, new specator mode, better ranked play, improved main menu background, and so on. With the new update the 20€ i pay for the game are even more worth it. And Psyonix plans are to keep going, maybe even into the direction of modding and crazy maps.\n\nSo yes. I am excited for every upcomming Update and DLC.\n\n\nConclusion\nI recommend this game to everyone. May it be casual players, those who play in a group to have fun together as well as the ones who like play competitively. Playing this game has the perfect fun/frustration balance and great learning curve.","July 18, 2015","true","181.4"," 48 of 53 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","48","53","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/252950/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Rocket League is a physics based football type game(no I will not call it soccer). It is actually a sequel to a game called Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars.  Rocket League was released in early July 2015 on the PC and PlayStation 4.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple, you control a rocket powered car and you use it to play a game of football. To many this may sound boring and unfun if you aren't a fan of either cars, or football - let me reassure you though, even if you aren't a fan, I guarantee you will have fun whilst playing Rocket League. The game is highly addictive and it will keep you playing until the early hours of the morning with that "Just one more match" feel to it.\n\nRocket League has a single player mode, an online multiplayer mode and a local multiplayer mode. I haven't played the single player as the multiplayer is completely where the action is at. The match making system works flawlessly, you will not have any problems finding a game, as of right now there are over 20,000 people playing. Each match lasts 5 minutes, and can consist of teams of 1, 2, 3 or 4 people. Personally I enjoyed the more hectic type matches of 3 or 4. Another nice little bonus is that Rocket League also works cross-platform, meaning you could end up being in a match with PS4 players which is one of the first I've seen run this type of system.\n\nThe controls are very simple, and you can pick them up in a matter of seconds.It is highly recommended that you play this game with a controller though, I have not heard any success stories of people using keyboard and mouse to play.\n\nGraphically, Rocket League is an awesome game to look at, just the right amount of lens flare, smooth animations and gorgeous looking backgrounds and arenas to play in. The game is ran using Unreal Engine 3, and it has been pushed to look stunning.\n\nI wouldn't exactly say Rocket League to be a difficult game, it has a very pick up and play vibe to it, but it will take you a couple of hours to become a real asset to your team mates, rather than just driving back and forth on the map chasing the ball.\n\nI have been playing Rocket League for almost six hours now, I am by no means a master at this game, and it feels as if I am only scratching the surface of the skill level you can reach. Like I said, this game is highly addictive, you will really struggle to put it down after you boot it up. The fast paced action and quick matches keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time.\n\nThis game runs as smooth as a babies bottom, the 60 fps, high resolutions and customize-able graphics make this a really PC game that is highly worth your time.'

Buy this game right now. You will never regret it.\n\nThis is one of the most entertaining, fun, and addictive games I've ever played. Just like its predecessor, this game provides hours upon hours of entertainment. The physics are superb, the gameplay is easy to pick up and thrilling to master, and it looks beautiful. It's a game that definitely gets better as you improve, which makes it more and more fun as you play it. There's something extremely addicitve about playing football/soccer with cars, and with the addition of boost, acrobatics, and flying, it just never stops being fun. It's one of those games where you always say "one more game" over and over again. There's plenty of different gamemodes to play, including season mode, drill training, online ranked, unranked, private, split-screen, split-screen online, and a bunch more.\n\nPros:\nThe game looks beautiful\nThe physics are spot on, so the game relies entirely on your own skill, with no automatic passing and shooting. You're on your own, which makes making saves and scoring goals so much more satisfying.\nIt's so addictive...like really addictive...like "oh my god is it 5am already?" addictive.\nIt's incredibly well optimised, as evident by the generous system requirements. You don't need a fantastic PC to play this game on high settings, but it still looks and plays beautifully at 60fps with not-as-good PCs\nThere is a bunch of customisation features, including body types, skins, hats, boost trails, tires, and whatnot.\nRank-based matchmaking, so you actually play people of similar ability, rather than being bored getting thrashed or thrashing other players\nThere's cross-play with PS4 users\nIt's a fantastic party game to play with your friends on split-screen, or online\nThe gameplay is flawless, making it really easy for new players to pick up, but allowing for an insanely high skill ceiling where the top players can really pull of some amazing skills\nCons:\nIt will ruin other aspects of your life, such as your social life and work life with its addictiveness.\nScore: 11/10","July 7, 2015","true","531.3"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","35","36","5","2"

I really wasn't aware of this game before it officially launched. How I could miss such a diamond I do not know. Usually I am not that much into racing games, which isn't really too much of a problem since I wouldn't exactly call it a typical racing game. Still it uses familiar driving mechanics and combines it with the most basic soccer rules. 2 teams of rocket-boosted-cars try to catapult, push, nitro-boost or bump an oversized football into the other teams goal.\n\nOn the "battlefield" you find small nodes which add a little to your boost-meter, which is quite limited and you have to carefully time the use of you nitro-boost - if it's time to defend and you find yourself in the other team's half you are not going to get there on time. If the ball is on the way to your opponent's goal you will want to have as much boost as possible to "kick" the ball as hard as you can and also to outrace the other players.\n\nYou can jump and even double-jump with your car, you can flip and turn in any direction whilst in the air in order to maximize your blocking possibilites and to kick the ball with a spinning move of your car's rear. It's hard to describe but play it for 1 hour and you will get what I mean. :)\n\nRocket League is crazy, it involves a lot of skill but does not have a particularly steep learning curve. There are only so many moves you can make and the real challenge is to master them all. Matchmaking works like a charm, new games are found quickly and you can decide wether you want to play ranked or just for the fun of it.\n\nI imagine if you play 3v3 together with 2 friends on your team this game gets even greater.\n\nThe only things I would wish for in future updates are a little more map variation and some different game modes.\n\nSince there is pretty much only one stadium with several different textures and lighting, things could get a tad repetitive after a while. I can really see the potential of ramps being in there, maybe some minor upgrades/boosts ready for pickup and so on... You could go really crazy expanding the existing formula.\n\nOther than that - I can recommend this without any shadow of a doubt!","July 12, 2015","true","36.4"," 43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","43","49","2","0"

The rockets add a layer of grace and skill that is hard to describe and is best experienced live. There are literally hundreds of Wow! and OMG! moments to be had. Rocket League has turned into one of my favorite multiplayer games, and I don't even like soccer!\n\nThe game has a large, but linear learning curve as you progress to the higher ranks. Start off learning the fundamentals like basic offense, defense, and blocking shots. Then as you get better, you improve dribbling skills, centering techniques, team positioning, plus hard and soft shots. As you advance further, you become proficient at wall shots, aerials, epic saves, and bad shot recovery. I have played nearly 200 hours and I still feel like I'm learning and improving my game.\n\nI find the game intensely addicting with its 5 minute matches. Once one game is over, I'm ready to start another and it's almost impossible to just play a single game. As my skills improve, it fuels my incentive to keep playing more.\n\nThey recently added a hockey modification which is amazingly good as well. I'd venture to say I like it even better than the original game.\n\nI can't praise Rocket League enough. It has the right mixture of speed, adrenaline, and fun.","January 4","true","886.6"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","39","45","3","2"

A very simple concept, but it's the most fun you could ever have in a video game. The learning curve is very steep, so you might struggle when you begin, but the game's addictive nature will probably grab you anyway and make you play for hours until you're too tired to even go to sleep, so you play more and you realize you've been playing 5 days non-stop and you're dead. Even though it's such a simple idea, there's so much you can do in this game. If you're a newcomer, don't forget to try flying! (Spoiler alert: It's f***ing awesome!)\n\nIt also has great potential to become a big e-sports game, something that I'm really looking forward to.\n\nThe list of features at the moment isn't huge, but hopefully the devs will add more things in future updates like they've promised. (Psyonix always keeps their promises, so I wouldn't worry about it!) The season mode is a great place for new players to practice their skills against the AI, but the online mode is where most of the fun of the game lies. And, the customization is sick. Oh and the insanely cool replay editor! Also new free maps in the future confirmed!\n\nAll in all this game is very solid, very competitive and fun, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes skill-based games or is into sports.\n\n\nBetter than FIFA. 10/10.","July 7, 2015","true","294.6"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","32","34","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MeltingComet/recommended/252950/","MeltingComet","龍 Rip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MeltingComet/","329 products in account","Hey guys, it's Super Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle Cars...2? Or I guess Rocket League?\n\nRocket League is one of those ideas you're surprised has not been done yet. But it's totally been done before. What Rocket League does is refine, simplify, and intensify.\n\nPros:Stellar and easy-to-grasp controls that invoke "Easy to learn but hard to master"\nStellar visuals and optimization on PC. The grass looks magnificant!\nA good variety of cosmetics to use.\nAbsolutely god damn fun. Matches are energetic, intense, filled with determination, and sometimes insane errors.\nA neato soundtrack. Personal favorites are Whiplash and Fireworks.\nNitpicks:The game does not have a lot of unique modes beyond it's simple Soccer mode, with several varients like Snow Day.\nCons:The ranking system (As of Season 1) is absolutely broken. Those who have fallen far behind the ladder have absolutely zero chance to rank up. As of Season 2, the ranking system will be swapped to something like CS:GO, so this will definitely fix these problems.\nAs with any multiplayer game, it's supplement AI are not the best to play with, making modes like Season not so enjoyable to play. Thankfully, most online matches normally don't involve them, so they don't affect the game in a similar fashion that bots do in CS.\nThe Review\nRocket League is the result of a well-refined concept that's made it's debut back in 2008 as Super-Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle Cars. While SARPBC had a whole lot more modes, maps and content, Rocket League is a lot more light in content, but that's because that was something the devs didn't focus on. Instead, Rocket League is a much more refined and focused game.\n\nThe game plays and feels amazing, and this is because of what's changed since then. The cars have weight to them, which gives the player the feeling that they have much more control.\n\nIt's team-based play is also very solid, because you're playing as an individual player, there's a lot of real coordination and technique that makes it so different from playing, say Fifa. It's so refreshing to play a sport game that brings out something that most of those games don't, and it's the indidviduality of the players. The want to stand out among others, or to stay behind and support your friends, that's the ingenuity of Rocket League.\n\nIt does lack in content however. It may be offputting that the simple, Soccer-based mode is really the only mode in the game, and a lot of the maps are in a similar layout, but that's what makes this game feel so refined. It's excusable because it's so fun to continue playing match after match. It's like Soccer; It never gets old.\n\nIt's presentation is solid too. It has a surprisingly beast soundtrack, with the likes of Hollywood Principle stealing the show. It's visuals, while not on par with big Triple AAA games, looks crisp and beautiful. The grass on the fields look mighty damn shiny, and the cars models are smiplistic and detailed.\n\nPsyonix did a fantastic job taking a good concept, execute it once, and refine it years later into a much more enjoyable experience. Rocket League may not have a ton of maps, or game modes, but what it has is a game that will continues to amaze (and ♥♥♥♥) me to all sorts of levels.\n\nTL;DR - Rocket League is a energetic and satisfying game that feels more like soccer then games like Fifa. And that's weird.\n\nFor more reviews on all sorts of games, follow  Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews  here!","January 24","true","18.9"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","27","30","5","4"

I love Rocket League!\n\nEven with no interest whatsoever in the theme, I find Rocket League excellent as a game. Easy to learn, hard to master. It doesn’t start dull, it is fun right from the start as a beginner, and it only gets better as you improve.\n\nIt involves a very wide range of skills which gives the gameplay a lot of variety by constantly engaging your different abilities. I don’t mean variety as in different environments or doing different things, rather the variety applies to the ways in which the game demands your participation both physically (mechanical skills, accuracy, timing, consistency, …) and mentally (spatial awareness, intuition for the game’s physics like momentum or bounces, team coordination, …), pretty much like a real sport. This makes it one of the most fulfilling video games to play.\n\nRocket League is the video game that feels the closest to real life sports. It involves the same kind of skills and provides the same kind of fun. Absolutely recommended to everyone!","May 23","true","100.8"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","30","38","2","0"

As for Rocket League? It's simple, it's well made, and it's a blast.\n\nThe five minute rounds offer an ADHD filled event of rocket powered cars soaring through the air, slamming into one another, and explosive balls when you score! You can save replays to go back and watch your impressive goals, or to make beautiful videos. Different roles await: do you fancy yourself as the dashing striker who brings your team to victory? Or perhaps the demolition expert  who pushes your rivals to the breaking point and opens up opportunites to score? Or even the goalie, denying the enemy the sweet sweet taste of success. JUMP ON IN!\n\nPROS:\n-Full car cuztomization\n-Rocket Powered Acrobatic Aerial Capabilities!\n-Vibrant graphics\n-Intuitive replay system\n-1v1- 4v4 Online play\n-2-4 Player split screen action!\n-Season mode\n-Ranked online!\n-Demolition\n-Training modes\n-Kind and open Devs!\n-Incoming DLC including maps from SARPBC!\n-ONLY $20!

Please buy it in or out of a sale :)\n\nSo, I was going to write a review at 100 hours but another 100 later and its... Been a few days... What can I say, the game is worth it at full price PLUS DLC (I have most DLC -- 3 are needed to 100% achievements). This game is very easy to pick up and there are tons of skills to master the game -- from dribbling to advanced aerials -- if you want to play it competitively or just improve. Plus there are tons more to come with Rocket Labs introduced and there is a basketball mode in the making as I write this review :)\n\n---------\n\nPros --\nGreat customization with base game and/or with DLC. You can customize paint, wheels, car body, the boost, hats etc!\nGreat common and uncommon drops\nGameplay is steady, you can easily play with keyboard and mouse or controller (I personally use an Xbox One controller)\nLove the soundtrack\nAchievements are easy but maybe a little bit of a grind for some\nThe UI is clean and well set out -- there is even a nice quick chat feature (Nice shot, Centering, Defending etc)\nYou can save replays to watch later or upload to youtube\nIt's so much fun to play alone in 1v1, matchmaking in 2v2/3v3/4v4 or with friends\nCommunity is mostly friendly, you can now report... the rest...\nThe devs are great, they are constantly changing the game with a new ranked system and maps etc!\nGreat training modes and multiple levels of difficulty of AI to practice offline or before/in between a match\nWell... You get the point with the pros...\n\nCons\nAchievements and little content in the DLC does not feel worth it but forces you to buy if you want to 100% the game... DLC isn't needed so not a big deal. But hey... Batmobile DLC... GET IT!\nI have had maybe 2 crashes and a few bad connections in my time, but it reconnects you to the match you were in so you don't lose XP\nConclusion... Buy the game. Its awesome. I've had a blast and there will be many more hours of fun to come! The game will only get better from here! Whoops... Nice shot! 10/10 <3","March 11","true","393.9"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","3"

This is my choice as game of the year.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nPS: When you're looking at the store page, you can't miss the DLCs being there, but don't start thinking about them as a stupid, greedy move made by the developers, the game is cheap, so are the DLCs, they just add cars (Every car is almost the same, they're totally balanced and equal), antennas, wheels, boost "skins", and other aesthetic stuff. They're not necessary in any way, but I'm buying them all to support the developers, and because they're worth the price.","October 13, 2015","true","441.1"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","22","25","7","7"

You have a ball. You have simple controls. Does that mean the game is simple? Yes! Does that mean the game is easy, boring or that it sucks? No, definitely not!\n\nGeneral Features: Rocket League features several modes, as example an online mode at which you can play ranked and unranked games, varying between 1 vs. 1, 2 vs. 2, 3 vs. 3 and 4 vs. 4. Of course, you can also play with your friends at home via. local co-op because it's one of the games which has a splitscreen mechanism for up to 4 players - true old-school gaming! It also features several offline modes, such as exhibition matches against bots or season mode against bots. And of course, it also features a tutorial and a training mode which both are well made.\n\nGameplay: The general gameplay is very fast, very fun and very addictive. The controls are simple, but mastering the cars and the battle-car is difficult. The bots are playing surprisingly good, there's a high possibility that you will lose your first games against the bots.\n\nCustomization possibilities: Players are able to customize their battle-car by unlocking items which are gained by completing an online or offline match. This includes changing the body, decal, paint, wheels, rocket trail, topper and antenna of the battle-car. In total, there are more than 150 customization items unlockable, which means that there are millions of different customizations possible.\n\nMy conclusion: Rocket League is incredibly fun. Rocket League is incredibly addictive. Rocket League is incredibly competitive. If I would have to compare the gameplay to another game, I would only be able to choose Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, which is the prequel to Rocket League, made by the same developer. I strongly recommend to buy this game even if you don't like sports games as Rocket League feels way different compared to FIFA or PES. In my opinion Rocket League is definitely worth the money.","July 7, 2015","true","912.1"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","26","33","4","0"

Just five minutes of fast, exciting, and competitive action. Three hours later, you’ll find time for another match. Rocket League is a fantastic multiplayer game with simple mechanics and a tremendous learning curve. It is easy to play and hard to master. You drive a rocket car and hit a ball into a goal. On a basic level it requires timing hits, simple passing, and good positioning. More advanced techniques include aerials, dribbling and pinching. Hitting goals is satisfying but you are always searching for that perfect match with good cooperation. With many skills to master, it is a game that provides reward after many hours. While there is some luck involved, such as when balls are contested, skill usually wins out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arekso/recommended/252950/","arekso","Alexo#21358","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arekso/","254 products in account","I was recommended this game after offhandedly mentioning it to a friend, and it ended up being one of my favourite games of the year.  Where to start? It's multiplayer focused football with cars. Some people seem to dismiss it as a simple game that will get boring fast, but I would disagree. The game's core mechanics are so well polished that playing feels fluid and natural from the get-go, especially if you play racing games. The car handling is very simple, nothing like the likes of GRID or GTA IV. I think this handling system is good for the game, complex handling mechanics (gear systems, realistic turning, etc) would probably hamper the experience, when the game can be very fast paced and precision heavy at times. At higher levels of play you will use your boost to fly through the air, tilting your car to direct it towards the ball in mid-air. This requires practice and precision, and is very satisfying when executed correctly. This game has a high skill ceiling in that regard, where goals and saves can be pulled off, and the difficulty of them can skyrocket depending on the situation.\n\nThe multiplayer is good, there are dedicated servers, in fact ONLY dedicated servers, which is something I've never really come to think about. The game modes range from 4v4, 3v3, 2v2 to 1v1. All are different in how they are played, but 3v3 is the mode I play the most and the mode that is considered "standard" in the game. In 3v3 you can learn about player rotation on the pitch, defensive roles, attacking roles and backup roles. Look these up on the steam guides if you are curious. The servers are split into casual and ranked games, where casual games do not impact your MMR or "elo" but do give you EXP and affect your all-time stats, and ranked games will impact your ranked points and MMR as well as your all-time stats. The ranked system uses points to monitor progress, starting at around 200, and you gain points on victory and lose them when you lose a match. I play this game alone mostly, and an issue I have with casual games were teamstacking in 3v3 games, where I would be matched against 3 players who were all friends, and the games would be fairly one-sided from having to play against a team that most likely communicated their play amongst themsleves. Since switching to ranked games I have not felt the urge to go back, there is even a mode called "Solo Standard" which is exclusively for single players looking to play 3v3 without the worries of facing a coordinated team.\n\nTeamplay is a large part of rocket league, all modes except 1v1 require coordination to be played well, perhaps with the exception of 4v4 mode appropriately named "Chaos" where there are so many cars that strategy and balance dips from having too many cars on the pitch at once. You will have to learn simple things like proper round start etiquitte, player rotation, setting up passes, scoring goals from passes, scoring aerials, outmaneuvering the opponent, and so on. The community is a mixed bag, sometimes you will encounter jerks who spam chat-commands ironically, sometimes you will have a pleasant game full of sportsmanlike players. So not that different from most other communities, I'd say. You can even turn text chat off if you want to.\n\nOverall I can say that this game is one of my favourite games of the year, and I will continue to play it... indefinetely? Maybe.","December 23, 2015","true","326.4"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","5"

After first being introduced to it by watching E3, I told myself to keep this game in mind because I might want to buy it sometime in the (distant) future. A little bit later, checking out some twitch as usual, this game was just everywhere. So I watched some streams and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Much more than I had anticipated. So eventually I decided to just buy this game and give it a go. I have to say it's been long since I bought a game at full price, but it has been very much worth it (so far).\n\nWhat I like\n\n+ Gameplay is VERY enjoyable: intense, hilarious, chaotic and rageworthy\n+ Even though the gameplay isn't really diverse, this game won't bore you easily\n+ Tutorial + training areas!\n+ Matches are short (5 minutes), making it ideal for casual players also\n+ You don't necessarily need friends for this game, however I do recommend playing with them\n+ AI (computer controlled) cars are pretty decent\n+ Controlling your car isn't that easy (physics-based), however very satisfying\n+ Car customization!\n+ Game looks gorgeous\n+ Some nice catchy tunes that totally get you into the mood for some intense Racing/football\n+ Apparently it's best played with a controller, but mouse and keyboard work totally fine too\n+ Price tag is about right\n\nWhat I don't like\n\n- T-E-A-M-W-O-R-K. Not everyone knows this word. Still, when I'm in a bad team, I just laugh at how bad we are (or I ragequit)\n- AI cars (not always so decent)\n\nConclusion\n\nOverhyped? Maybe, but all in all, a very enjoyable game. Whether you just want a quick 20 min break or a long 3- hour session, it's all up to you. One thing is for sure: you'll have fun. That is, if you don't take the game too seriously.","July 25, 2015","true","272.7"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","20","25","4","2"

Yes, I still exist. I meant to post this review earlier but I couldn't due to some technical issues.\n\n\nLet me put this out here: I'm not a soccer fan. Probably because I'm an American (despite my name) but I just never got into it. I played it when I was three and quit before our first game, so I was never big on it. But then I was introduced to Rocket League. At first, I didn't care too much for it. Eventually, however, I soon realized I was missing out. When I was on the verge of buying it, my awesome friend Cyroden bought the game for me at the most convenient time. After playing it when I had my opportunities, I'm ready to give an opinion on it.\n\nGraphics\nThe game is gorgeous. Very gorgeous at that. Compared to other "sports" games, this one stands out. Everything is incredibly detailed and is high quality compared to the other potatoes we've gotten in the past few years. Not to mention, this game comes with a replay feature, and with it, if used properly, you can make some incredible screenshots. I don't have any issues with anything here.\n\nGameplay\nThis is the core of the game. If this is bad, then it's not worth buying the game. But I gave this game a thumbs-up, so you know what I'm going to say. Everything is very smooth and flopping around in a car is just flat out awesome. It's a simple concept but it has a learning curve that's quite time consuming to master. I would highly recommend a controller to ease the suffering a little bit, but it's not that necessary. It's still playable with the keyboard and mouse. Getting adjusted to the controls can take a bit of time, because I first mixed jumping and toggling the ball camera up, and it didn't turn out so well. Some of the controls do seem questionable, even after I converted to controller with this game. However, it isn't too rough and you should manage to get the hang of it within a couple of hours. Also, if you're a dude who loves creating stuff (like myself) then praise the devs of this game for adding a car editor here. There's also no pay-to-win techniques or anything here, you can get every single item in the game without spending a dime, and there's no way you can pay for the items anyway. Everything is unlockable, and the editor is simple to use. Would I add some more to it? Yes. But it's so rare to find any kind of simplistic editors these days I'm already thankful there's one in this game.\n\nStory\nThere's no story, it's just a multiplayer game meant to be fun, this won't be counted towards the final score.\n\nAudio\nThis one is going to be short and sweet as it doesn't really matter all that much in this situation. The music fits and some of the tunes can be catchy, and the audio is pretty solid as well. There are no major flaws, but there's nothing to drool over here.\n\nReplayability\nOf course, this is the debatable one here. I didn't get hopelessly addicted to it, but I still really enjoy this game. My one problem, and it's probably the biggest issue I have with the game, is the fact that it seems heavily reliant on having friends play with you. I had friends to play this game, and when I played with them, it made a significant difference in the fun factor of the game. I would've played a lot more of this if it wasn't for the fact it's not as fun if you're playing alone. But, it does excel in the fact that it's a fun game to play with friends so I'd recommend trying to find some out in the wild.\n\nVerdict\nRocket League is flat out fun. Yes, it's flawed, but it's still an excellent title to play if you've got some friends, a controller (preferably) and a free night where you've got nothing to do. Finally, a game that had a clean PC release and didn't try and drain your money!\n\nGraphics - 9.5/10\nGameplay - 9.0/10\nStory - NONE\nAudio - 7.5/10\nReplayability - 7.5/10\n\n.:8.4/10:.\n\n+Beautiful graphics\n+Smooth, simple gameplay with a solid learning curve\n+CAR EDITOR!\n+No cheap pay-to-win techniques\n+Acceptable audio...\n\n-...but it doesn't get any awards\n-Heavily reliant on having friends\n-Confusing controls at first","October 5, 2015","true","60.7"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","17","20","3","0"

Connections to the server is good at 90ms ping but sometimes goes over 300ms which makes it a little hard to play but still playable.\n\nI reccomend this to anyone who likes cars and soccer. Its reccomened to use a controller but i use both keyboard and controller. Its best to play with friends so you can have a better team that you can talk to using a mic. I will be recording this sometime to upload to youtube :D\n\nIn conclusion i give this game a thumbs up\n\nEdit: i have bought all the dlcs so far and they are all worth buying if you got spare money\n\nP.S: if you found this review helpful give it a thumbs up so otthers can see this review :P","July 31, 2015","true","399.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","2"

(I need all the help I can get!)\n\n\nBall Control\n\nAs a football simulation Rocket League is a great driving game.\nThe handling of the various vehicles is surprisingly good and complimented by a very intuitive set of controls.\nYou'll need to dust off your game pad to get the most out of Rocket League, but it's totally worth it!\nIt's rare that I play a game where the controls feel so dialled in and natural.\nIt doesn't take long before you're hitting the controls without thought to make the car jump, flip and spin on command, of course doing this in the right location to make the ball go where you want is another matter.\n\n"Easy to learn, hard to master" are six words that definitely apply to Rocket League.\n\n\nTyre-Ball\n\nThe game itself is fantastic to play,  you can choose between intimate 1v1 matches all the way up to the mayhem you'll experience in a chaotic 5v5 match.\nWith a little (or maybe a lot) of practice you'll find yourself sliding and skidding your vehicle into position to intercept, pass and shoot the ball.\n\nIt's a great feeling when you manage to pull off an impressive move (whether accidental or not) and leaping your car into the air to nudge a high flying ball into your opponents goal is soooo satisfying, especially in an online match when you've got a real audience to admire you car-ball prowess.\n\nThere's a tutorial and single player mode too which are both vital if you want to learn the ropes before you take your newly fledged "tyre-ball" talents online.\nIf I could give you some advice to avoid annoying others and embarrassing yourself when you first fire up Rocket League it would be this:\n\n"Practice before you start playing online!"\n(Hey, that's six words again, spooky!)\n\n\nHear Me Roar!\n\nSo we know the game plays well, but what are the aesthetics like?\nWell, the arenas are all beautiful and provide a pretty backdrop which you'll probably hardly notice as you zoom around the pitch.\n\nThe vehicles themselves are bright and varied with some neat customisation options (although I'm sad to say that "go-faster stripes" did not make me a better player).\n\nThe sound is of a high standard too, from the roar of the engines to the roar of the crowd, the atmosphere created by the audio gives the game an energy and intensity which heightens the whole experience.\n\nRocket League looks and sounds great!\n(yes, I'm doing the six words thing on purpose now.)\n\n\nWhat's in a name IV ?\n\nBut can I sum rocket league up in six words?\nhmmm...\n\nWell there are cars battling to win the ball, let's call them battle-cars, they're rocket powered, maybe even supersonic and they are definitely acrobatic....\n\nMaybe something like\n\n"Supersonic Rocket Powered Acrobatic Battle Cars..."\n\nalthough that does sound familiar...\nIt'd be a great name for a game though...\n\nWouldn't it?\n\n\nFinal Whistle\n\nWhatever you want to call it, Rocket League is a polished, intuitive and extremely addictive alternative sports title.\nI'm having a blast with it!\n\nBut remember, if you do come and join the fun (and you should) and if you encounter a player online with an unprecedented lack of skill (and go-faster stripes), take it easy on them...\n\nIt might be me!\n\nFor the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/rocket-league-review.html","September 15, 2015","true","2.3"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","71","22","31","11","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/commanderllama/recommended/252950/","commanderllama","Lord Captain Commander Llama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/commanderllama/","437 products in account","LAUNCH WEEK WARNING: The game servers are having problems at the moment, and when they're down you're stuck to offline play. If you're only buying this for multiplayer, I recommend waiting until the devs sort things out.\n\nVehicular Football/Soccer is not something one usually thinks about, so it's not something one would imagine they need in their life.\n\nIn a single match of Rocket League, I learned that it's something most people need more of in their lives. I still have much more to experience out of this game, so I may update the review as I go. As it stands, Rocket League is an incredibly fun indie racing-sports game. You are a car/truck, and you play football/soccer by driving into a giant bouncy ball. You have rocket boosters. You have vertical jump boosters. You can wall climb, ceiling crawl, bicycle kick, and sometimes explode.\n\nRocket League is the embodiment of "Easy to learn, difficult to master" gameplay. This means it is very accessible, but there's skills you can work on to improve your game. If you play just one match of Rocket League, you'll know how to play all the basics. For the advanced, there's learning better ball control with double-tapping, flying, and so on.\n\nTeamwork is absolutely effective. Get this, get your friends to get this, join a party and play as a team. Just like actual football/soccer! With flying, exploding, spinning, rocket cars.\n\nI'm still working through the game's content. There's offline exhibition games, a Season mode, online play, and tutorials. I'm hoping for some really intense online bracket tournaments involving multiple teams, but so far I've only played regular online matches. There's also local split-screen play, and cross-play with PS4 players! As of right now, I feel like most players are PS4 online, because no one seems to use the chat at all.\n\nI have one small gripe, but it may just tie in to the server troubles mentioned above: the matchmaking could be better. The matchmaking system is competent when it first sets a game up, but if a player drops, it doesn't seem to try to bring new players in. If a whole team leaves after a match, sometimes it will hang on the matchmaking for so long, it's faster for your team to just quit that match and create a whole new match, with new matchmaking that works. But bear this workaround in mind, and you can avoid those waiting periods.\n\nUpdate Edit: Although there's no traditional dedicated server listings, you can setup Private Matches with just your buddies or what not. Retracted that comment from matchmaking gripes.\n\nJust pure, nonsensical, sporting good times to be had here. A must have unless you despise racing, or sports, but honestly, you might even find yourself having a good time then too.\n\nTo think that I spent 2 years hyping over Batman: Arkham Knight, and that whole ♥♥♥♥♥torm goes down, and I have more fun with Rocket League in fifteen minutes than I probably ever will with that game. And for only $20.","July 10, 2015","true","43.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Why?\n\nI start playing this game with the intent to only play an hour, and realize many hours later how long I've actually been playing. Whether I'm experiencing a bitter defeat, a glorious victory, or a five minute overtime bout I'm still having a blast. I yell, I shout, I pump my fist in hoorah for that aerial save I just made. And I still can't get enough of this game.\n\nRocket League is a very well polished sportsy footballesque game where you drive cars and try to shoot the ball into the opposing teams goal. It's a simple concept but with all the moves and tricks your cars can perform there is suprising depth in how to play as an indvidual and as a team. You can perform all types of moves, you can do just about any type of roll or flip perceivable, single jumps, double jumps, and you can even fly with your boost. This is one of the few games that I've had this level of drive to master my play, and with two whole days of game time logged away I feel like I've really just mastered the basics and am just now scratching the surface on higher level play.\n\nI'm often a bit hestitant to jump into online games, especially ranked. I find ranked matches in general to be stressful and a little too adrenaline intensive, yet in Rocket League I've had nothing but a blast playing competitively even when I was as green as the turf I was driving on. I've never even hesitated to try new things in competitive games or to try and master aerial shots and other such techniques that are easy to screw up. In short, I've had a lot of fun playing this game and the drive to better my play has been a contributing factor to my enjoyment. Playing with a friend makes the game all the more enjoyable, being able to shout at each other over VOIP about each amazing shot we convert or each epic save we make makes an already exciting game all the more awesome.\n\nBottom line. This game is FUN. It's just fun. You jump in, you find a match, you play, and you have fun. It's not overly complex, it doesn't add lots of un-needed features. It's straight up action packed fun.\n\nP.S. And of course, like any good driving game, you can customize your ride so you can kick ♥♥♥ in style.","November 6, 2015","true","396.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Thankfully, there is someone out there who is a whiz programmer that  has put together a game that entertains people like me and I am sure a few "football" fans as well. Rocket League is built upon simple mechanics that are easy to pick up but difficult to master.

The crowd was responsive to everything that happens in the stadium: close to the enemy goal post? The crowd was jubilant. You fought off the ball that is about to get to the gate?

This review contains spoilers in Pros and Cons section.\nRocket League is one of the best Racing games I've seen. However a lot of people think its original, but its only a sequel to a game called "Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars". Still, I think its pretty fun if you grab some friends or meet new ones ingame. The game is based off soccer, but it has a twist that you play with cars. People might say this is more of a strategy game, thought its really not. You just kick the ball, save goals and pass ball. If you don't have a controller - Don't buy this game, cause without it, its not even so good. Controller gives you the feel of really beeing ingame. So now when I have basicly explained the whole game lets get into the Pros and Cons.\n\nPros:\n+Wonderful graphics.\n+No kids spamming in microphones.\n+A lot of options that you can modify.\n+Excelent matchmaking.\n+Tons of customizations for your car. (Includes wheels,paint job,car models,flags,hats.)\n+You can play in a party with your friends.\n+Cross-Platform Multiplayer - Play with your friends that don't use PC.\n+Controller Support.\n+No russian people cursing.\n+Perfect controlls.\n+Steam trading cards.\n+Steam achviements.\n+Excelent physics.\n\nCons:\n+None.\n\nNow throw FIFA out of your window and buy this game.

Playing a new vehicle is like installing a brand new game.\n\nThis game really puts you in a competitive state of mind. It's a type of intense that keeps you wanting to come back.

Long story short, it has been worth every penny, and is one of the most addictive games I have played in years.\n\nPros - Perfect for study breaks since each match is only about 5 minutes.  Read one chapter of your textbook... reward yourself with a match.\n- Simple and easy to play, but challenging to master.  Figuring out how to hit the ball (especially in the air) is difficult at first, and there is a learning curve.\n- Great developers who have already announced free DLCs (along with extra paid cosmetic DLCs).\n- Optimized even for low-spec PCs.\n- Cross-platform with PS4.\n\nCons - There used to be a problem with people quitting midway through a ranked game with no penalty.  However, now there is a 15 minute ban from matchmaking for leaving ranked games, so it is not as much an issue now.\n- Difficult to play without a controller, but still possible.  I would recommend a controller if you buy this.\n- Occasional lag on servers (but hopefully will be resolved in the future).\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this game.  10/10","August 1, 2015","true","280.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Rocket League. Okay, what to say about it?\n\nWell, for one, it's the pure definition of a competitive video game: it's easy to learn and takes a lifetime to master.\nI need, however to adress one thing that will put MANY people off: and that is the mix of genres it seems to have, and that is its mix of football and cars.\n\nI have no hesitation in recommending this game at all, including for people that do not like racing, football or both, simply because it doesn't belong to any of such genres and as such, the problems you have with those genres/games, you simply won't have here.:\n\n- The slow paced gameplay of football, filled with tactics, rules, free kicks, offsides, penalties, yellow and red cards, etc. etc. is COMPLETELY GONE! You can use ur nitro and completely obliterate the opposite team without any repercussions. The only thing football related here is that there's a ball (which is a bomb) and you need to put it in the opponent's goal (which will trigger the ball to explode).\n\n- And the same applies to the racing component: there are no pre-determined paths, no speed limits, no linearity, crashing won't penalize you all that much and the vertical limitations are gone as you can fly, jump, wall jump and basically do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want (which I will mention a bit further below in this review)!\n\nTo put it in a more adequate analogy... I guess I can call it the Quake of sports games  as it clearly takes ideas from the Arena FPS genre, which is where Psyonix (the devs) got a name with their big hit Unreal Tournament 2004 (alongside Epic and DE).\n\nIt allows a very engaging mix of football and cars. The devs could make a very plain car football game and that would be it. But they didn't do just that, did they?\n\nWell, ♥♥♥♥ NO! You can jump, double jump, dash forward, to the sides or even dash backwards, do bycicle kicks, drive on the walls, jump from those walls and fly across the whole map, boost around and so much else!\n\nIt will take you dozens of hours to master each technique properly and it helps that there is  ZERO RNG or stat based gameplay in the game!!: the cars all perform the same  except in 2 clear aspects: hitboxes (The big Van-like car has a much shorter but taller hitbox than the Dominus muscle car) and drifts/handbrake use. I am using my XBOX360 controller ( which I recommend, though keyboard is VERY intuitive as well ) with customized controls to my liking, where B is the handbrake. With, for example, the Takumi or the Breakout, you can do 180's MUCH more easily than with the Van-like car (I don't know the name of the Van, because I actually don't use it at all :p).\n\nGRAPHICS\nThe graphics are absolutely excellent! Grass looks quite impressive, the bloom and shaders are stunning and give the game a very well needed sense of "immersion" that you are in an actual stadium!\nThe game can run on pretty much any PC (granted, you may need to tweak it a bit on weaker PC's, of course) but when maxed out, it's a joy to both look at and play. There's AN FOV SLIDER!!!!! And many more camera options, graphics options are immense as well and can help you tweak the game to your liking (♥♥♥♥ motion blur).\n\nAUDIO\nAudio consist of 2 big elements: Menu soundtrack and In-Game effects.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is absolutely awesome! Easily one of the best I've heard the past decade. It makes you hum and bobble your head around with the cool pop tunes.\n\nSound effects are good, but good only. The car engines sound quite "meh", but the ball exploding, the sounds the stadium produce when a goal is scored (which are, btw, all different: Every stadium has it's own sound props, which is a very welcome attention to detail) are all very well done. There are lots of different boost trace skins (which I'll adress later) and each make their own sounds, which is, AGAIN, a very nice and welcome attention to detail.\n\nGAMEPLAYBesides all the cool moves I listed above I must say the physics in this game are the best I've seen in, probably, ever! I am not even kidding...\n\nThe game has the same mode (just score the most goals after 5 mins) but there are 4 playlists: 1v1 Duel, 2v2 Duos, 3v3 Standard and the 4v4 Chaos mode (and I can confirm it's chaotic as f*ck!).\n\nWhile there are no different modes... I can say that every playlist has it's own skill to be met. 1v1 requires a more balanced attack and defensive mindset,  2v2 is pure teamwork, 3v3 is a bit more chaotic  and there is space for a full 100% striker and a full-time 100% goalkeeper as well (even though it's not recommended: everyone needs to have a more mixed role, though a more attacking player and a more defensive player ARE CRUCIAL!) and 4v4 takes skill but I play it (as most probably do as well) just for the fun :D\n\nEXTRAS / CONTENT IN GENERAL\nThere is a spectator mode and an offline season mode, the latter is barebones at best and serves no purpose, only to practise against bots and collect some achievements.\n\nThere are 150 customization items for your cars, if I'm not mistaken. These involve Hats, Antennas, Boost trace skins (like a basic nitrous skin, a flamethrower skin, purple smoke, blue data-streams, rainbows (my favorite :D), etc. etc.), paint jobs, materials for the car (you can have cars made of carbon fiber, gloss, metal, etc., very GRID 2-esque, which I really like), overall:\n\nIt's nearly impossible to find a player with the exact same car as you.\n\nYou can save replays of your game to watch them later or brag to your friends about that amazing long shot or impossible save you managed to pull off successfully.\n\nThere a tutorial system that is VERY HELPFUL to noobs but later grows into ridiculously difficult saves and shots that are there to make you see how well you have mastered the game's mechanics (timing is very crucial in any save/shot you take and most of all... power of antecipation... kinda like the Quake multiplayer... eh... see why I called it the Quake of sports now? Well there you go...).\n\nThere is a ranked mode and leaderboards. There is also an unbelievable amount of stats, like "How many goals did you score with this hat?", "How many kilometers with this set of wheels?" or "How many saves did you do with this paintjob?", which add alot to a very entertaining package that takes dozens, if not hundreds of hours for you to get bored with.\n\nOh and there's crossplatform play with PS4 players (which from my experience, most tend to suck).\n\nTL;DR and CONS\nAlright, let's re-arrange it all with a basic PROS (+) / CONS (-) system since you lazy "I hate reading" ♥♥♥♥s love it so much :)\n\n+ Great and enourmous ammounts of customization;\n+ Takes lots of skill to be good at it;\n+ Beautifu Graphics;\n+ Phenomenal Soundtrack\n+ Formidable Physics\n+ Huge amounts of replayability\n+ Crossplatform play with PS4\n+ Some lucky shots, saves and nail-biting close matches will be some of funniest and most satisfying moments in your gaming life, respectively;\n+ Formidable sense of growth with every match. You don't gain anything, no guns and none of that ♥♥♥♥. But you gain the most important thing that 95% of today's modern games don't offer: YOU GAIN SKILL! (Shocker, I know, most of you probably haven't heard of this word at all :p)\n+ Adequate even for non-football and non-racing fans as it has nearly nothing in common with those genres.\n\n- Server issues at launch (now fixed)\n- Barebones and pointless single player season mode (MP season mode would be cool, though)\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to literally everyone that enjoys video games.","August 29, 2015","true","476.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","12","15","5","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderbits/recommended/252950/","murderbits","murderbits","http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderbits/","2796 products in account","Rocket League is a game by the studio that made the free-to-play game Nosgoth that punches far above its weight. It is easy to learn, with a pair of tutorials that can be completed in under ten minutes and is almost immediately fun. However, the addiction starts to set in when you push yourself to start mastering the game.\n\nYour first few matches will feel chaotic and hinging entirely on chance. As you acclimate to the controls and physics, you become more confident within the game world and find yourself capable of intentionally performing maneuvers. That becomes a turning point in the game and as you perfect these skills, there comes an incredible elation when you line a shot up -- probably with an assist from another driver -- and nail that in. All with determined calculation, rather than random luck.\n\nThe modes and arenas have minor variants, but are consistent. It quickly becomes a game pitting carthletes against each other and nothing else. True tests of skill and reflex. There aren't really even any modifications that impact skill, either. All the adding trappings you unlock are cosmetic. The game has ranked and unranked multiplayer of different team sizes and single player with a season/tournament campaign. That's it. That's all it needs.\n\nMy only negative experience has been with AI/Bots. They are uncannily talented and whether they're on your team or the opposition, they can ruin the game. When you are the only human on your team, there's no joy in absolutely trouncing the other team, because you know it's because of the unfair advantage the bots provided you. Perhaps this is better in the Ranked league, but in general play, there are a lot of people who just drop out, midgame. I do not know if these are occurring because of network issues in this overwhelmingly popular (and therefore still trying to ramp up server and network capacity) game or if they're just poor sports. Either way, having bots substitute is frustrating -- and they don't seem to do match-making for in-progress games, to substitute slots with real players.\n\nBack to the positives though -- and this is a big one. You will almost immediately be in awe at how glitzy and shiny the world looks. The game has a great art style and fantastic presentation. Slick and not quite realistic, but very high quality. And the world is smooth. High framerate with, in my experience, absolutely no hitching or lagging or anything else. The game is smooth as silk.\n\nI find this a surprise, because it seems like a game that by all rights should be a bit janky. It should come with caveats and "for the price point" justifications. It doesn't, though. It's an excellent experience that feels well-crafted. It sets a framework for itself and stays within it, polishing what it does well rather than expanding endlessly upon it, poorly.\n\nIf the trailer and live streams make this game seem appealing to you, I'd advice picking it up even at the $20 USD price. As long as the playerbase is still there when there is a big sale, that sale is going to be a no-brainer. If this game is found for $10 USD over the next few months, through the holidays -- it is going to be a downright steal. There is so much fun to be had here. Even more so, if you have a couple friends to build a team with.\n\nThis is a total gem that I have no reservations about recommending.\n\nIf you want to see some gameplay starting from the first time the game is launched, the following is a six hour live stream of Rocket League (begins about 5m into the video):\n\nhttps://youtu.be/xFd_Zh9fSEw","July 17, 2015","true","5.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"

The one downside (doesn't affect me) is that you will most likely need a high end computer to run this game without lag.\n\n***Rating***\nGraphics: 9.5/10\nGameplay: 10/10\nAudio: 9/10\nMultiplayer: 8.5/10\n\nOVERALL: 9.75/10","July 26, 2015","true","39.9"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","13","18","4","0"

Luckily, they made this free weekend and i finally had the chance to try it out after a long period of waiting and to be honest i got totally amazed! i don't know how to describe the feeling but this game is just great.\ni didn't had the chance to play it for long because i wasted most of my weekend downloading it but here are some positive things about it: (i couldn't find anything bad about it anyways)\n+ brilliant idea for a game\n+ It's so easy to learn\n+ solid game-play and smooth controlling\n+ Beautiful graphics, and it doesn't require a PC gamer to run\n+ there is no fancy upgrades or items that gives you extra abilities\n+ all the cars have the same speed and abilities, it's all about you and your skills\n+ you can make your car look like whatever you want! customize it using your own style\n+ full of players, this game is so alive\n+ no bugs, no crashed\n+ played for 6 hours strait, didn't see a single cheater, and everyone was so nice with me, it's so rare to find such a friendly gaming community nowadays so this is a big up for the game\n+ infinity hours of fun\nI'm really glad i tried this gem, i want to give a big thank you to the developers for giving us such a generous chance to try it out\ni enjoyed every single moment of the 6 hours i played but unfortunately i don't have enough money at the moments so i guess i'll miss this sale .. for now this game is in the top of my wishlisted games and i'll try hard to get it as soon as possible i can\nfor the rest of you out there, i wonder why are you guys still here reading this review? just go buy it now! it's a must have one. 10/10\n\nEdit: as you already know i bought this game and spent more 45 hours playing it, it's absolutely amazing! i'll update this review as soon as i feel i'm ready, stay tuned! :P","April 25","true","53.3"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VirusHunter/recommended/252950/","VirusHunter","VirusHunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VirusHunter/","1439 products in account","The great thing about the beautiful game is that it's a very basic concept: Get the ball into the goal. Video games have put various spins on that concept with great results, and Rocket League joins that list.\n\nYou drive a car straight out of Speed Racer. It's got jump jacks and jet engines that you can actually use to fly for a brief period. It drives great. You can even drive along the wall. Drifting is as simple as holding down a button. Easy to use camera controls and UI elements make sure that you know where the ball is. The presentation is amazing and can get you hyped very easily. The game itself is simple to learn but with the boost system there are some very advanced techniques to figure out. Multiplayer supports 4-player splitscreen as well as 8-player online, even both at the same time. And if you're playing by your lonesome, the AI players can keep you company. Did I forget to mention this game also has crossplay with the PS4 version?\n\nRocket League is excellent and I would highly recommend it to anyone who's enjoyed arcade-style sports games like NBA Jam or NHL 3-on-3 Arcade.","July 11, 2015","true","2.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I am telling you already: go out and buy this game, it is one of the best games of this generation.\n\nGRAPHICSMade with the Unreal engine, it looks very damn great: particle effects, lighting, shadows, textures... Everything is well done. The only real nitpick I have are the arena: excluding the ones in Rocket Labs, there is nothing that makes each level unique other than a few changes in the background. But the physics are fantastic.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe game is very simple: it is soccer, but with cars equipped with rockets instead of players. You can boost, you can jump, and you can double jump. That is it. Is it simple? Yeah. But is it done perfectly? Hell yeah!\nThere are many game modes to choose from: 1v1 duel, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, Rocket Labs (experimental maps), Snow (that no one is playing), and the new Hoops (basketball). There is great variety, and each mode is fun to play. Each time you finish a game, you will get a reward, ranging from hats to flags to customize your car and make it your own.\n\nCHALLENGEThe bots can be pretty dumb, usually doing autogoals for no reason at all, and other times they are incredibly hard to beat. The game is very easy to understand and even to master, so almost every player will be a threat.\n\nSOUNDThe soundtrack to the game is fine, and the sound effects are okay.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThere is plenty of money for your buck: each round usually lasts around 5 minutes, and you will quickly notice that you have spent three consecutive hours saying "One more, and then I'll sleep". The achievements also require some skills and not easy to achieve tactics, like scoring a goal while reversing.\n\nOverall, Rocket League is a top notch game that is a must buy for every gamer out there who has a decent Internet connection: fun, addicting, challenging.

Long has this wizard travelled being known in the north by the Hobbits of Eriador as Gandalf the Undeniably Gingertastic, by those in the south the rednecks of all societies (F4Ze clan) as _Xx_Fazerino_goondoolf_exdee_xX_, but most commonly know as "Goondoolf the supr wise and awsme u knw fam" mainly by himself. Although this matters not for his skills measure wide and vast conquering any achievement by any mere mortal other than himself, such as his ultra superb french skills "Oui Oui! That's all I know....", to his oh so adorable stories about how he danced in Grade 1 as a small Sugar Plum Fairy. most broadly he is revered for his mastery of that which is the game Room Escape, or so he pronounced it for many years, and his overall 62 million defence experience mind you he never truly received his max cape... frikn noob. In short, this man is so accomplished you can't even begin to truly convey your emotions before they destroy your innermost organs from his overall goodlookingness and Roblox skillz, and therefore you should listen intently to his awesome review. Without any further ado I happily present _Xx_Fazerino_goondoolf_exdee_xX_'s epictastic review chock-full of savagery, romance, Captain Jack Sparrow and of course Star Wars Conspiracy theories about Han Solo being alive and being an ewok who 360 no scopes good ol' Snokerino in the face.\nReview in 3, 2 , 1....\n\n_Xx_Fazerino_goondoolf_exdee_xX_: Well... at least I tried it i suppose.

Rocket League puts you in the shoes of one of these vehicles as you do your best to try and put that stupid god damn ball into the stupid god damn net if only your god damn team would stop charging at the god damn ball like you're part of a god damn peewee soccer team.\n\nGod damn.\n\n\nNever has a game made me feel as inadequate as Rocket League, it's like living in a box while Tommy Two Tooth lives in a relatively clean dumpster. I want that dumpster, Tommy.\nThe game can be played with anything from two to eight people, who's objective is to hit the giant ball into the giant net. This is easier said than done half the time since you have 6 or 8 people charging into the ball with the hope of it somehow finding the net. I mean, I'm guilty of this two, but I have the excuse of being ripped on MDMA for most of my life.\n\nSounds simple, right? Well, it is, but it also mixes in a few other elements. Not only does your car move fairly fast, but it also comes with a turbo feature so you can haphazardly drive up the wall and fly off the ceiling. You can also double jump to reach a high flying ball and miss completely. One of the more advanced techniques is to use the turbo boost mid air so you can fly of sorts and miss the  ball while it's still in the air. My favorite feature is hitting the ball and having it accidentally fly into my own net, having my friends laugh and yell at me while I wonder why I'm sober.\n\nHaha, just kidding. I don't have friends.\n\nMissile Franchise however has one major advantage. And that's how easy it is to pick up. You can go weeks, if not months of not playing and still be fairly awful as you were while you still played. It's hard to take a game like Rocket League seriously and that's probably it's strongest point, mixing in both casual and hardcore players and showing that we're both equally garbage.\n\nShould you play Rocket League?\n\nI say you should, it's fun, fast, and frantic, it's great to play with others, and it also lets you destroy little kids to the point that they make high pitch noises and Pikachu sounds for the rest of the game until they quit.\n\nSeriously, I'm not joking, we did that once, we broke him.\n\nProjectile Tournament gets 8 cars flying aimlessly through the air out of 10.\n\nThe curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation\n","February 6","true","58.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","9","11","9","0"

Playing with random strangers or with AI provides a significantly less enjoyable experience as it is the camaraderie and “oh man, did you see that!” moments that elevate the game above its simple premise. The promise of free content updates and the highly active community are further incentives to join the fun, though the staying power of the game is something that will be revealed only with time.\n\nRead Full Review [www.newgamenetwork.com]","August 1, 2015","true","234.0"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","1"

So it's impressive when one does. I started playing last nite and I'v already put 19hrs in the game..\n\nLet me just throw this out there: I HATE soccer. I think it's boring as f***. Tosh (the comedian) said it best with "Watching people chase a ball for 4 hours to end 0 / 0 is not enjoyable unless ofcourse the bleachers collapse and half of Europe dies. Maybe they would score more if they didn't flop everytime someone stepped on their toe."\nNot a huge fan of racing games, and I HATE sports games ( I mean I like to play sports for real, but I hate watching them or playing the video game alternatives).\n\nBut this is way more than just cars pushing a ball around. The controls are amazing. I'v never felt like I'v had this much control of what's going on in a sports game as I do with this.  It's basically NINJA CARS. WTF is better than ninja cars?! Thats what I thought.. Nothing. You can jump, double jump. air dash, and even fly. There's driving on and up walls, flips.. You name it. The action is intense, your fingers will hurt, your face will hurt from laughing, and if your throat doesn't hurt by the time your done then you aren't communicating with your teammates, and communication is key.. Even if it's call your buddy a d0uche for hogging the ball.. How will he ever learn otherwise?\n\n10/10 for me. It's a great game.\n\nThere are some issues with being able to communicate with other players cause it's crossplatform, but I team up with my current gamer buddies so that doesn't really bother me..\n\nGood luck and see you on the field!!!!","July 23, 2015","true","359.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","71","12","17","6","6"

And you unlock the items just by playing matches, which makes it very easy to get new items.\nThe camera options are very convenient, Allowing you to change the FOV, Height, Angle, and distance of the camera.\nNow, for the actual game, the seasons mode is very fun and competitive, allowing you to pick from different teamates, and to choose how many cars are on the teams. 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 are the option. 4v4 is my favourite so far though, as it's rather chaotic.\nPossibly the best thing about seasons mode is that even by yourself you still get very competitive, and that's something that i dont think many games deliver on.\nThe music is a bit garbled and im not sure whether or not its supposed to play all the time, as it usualy stops within a few secconds.\nOverall, for a game that was just released, it is very fun and i'd recommend it to everyone, whether they like sports or not. I think this game would be even more entertaining with friends, but i don't have any friends that own this game.","July 16, 2015","true","16.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The countdown is over and two cars (or four, or six, or eight) lunge at the ball, all those colored and crazy boost trails converging at the center, a single thump, a mess of antennae, cars flying all over the place, the ball going up and away and everyone scrambles to send it to the opponent's side of the field. You zig-zag around, you and your team hitting your best shots, the opponent hitting their best saves, until finally a small mistake and you score. Or get scored.\n\nThe replay kicks in, you relax a bit and realize something: It's been 15 seconds since the game started.\n\n\nNostalgic in its simplicity, more than modern in its presentation, Rocket League is like Fifa Street meets Re-Volt with extra rockets. A game that wants you to get in and get flying as soon as possible and keeps you playing not with shady design decisions but with pure and fast competitive action. An amazing reminder that sometimes less is much better.

As of a competitive game, it is obvious that you will have hundreds, if not thousands of hours invested in this game. It is easy to learn, however hard to master. If you are scared of the cars having advantages and disavantages, dont be worried: they are purely aesthetic and has no influence on gameplay. And it also combines the fact that its a great game, both for bringing your friends together for marathons of laughs and for marathons of competitiveness.]\n\nIf i can describe it competitively i would say its like you are having shots of competitiveness and fun; it's games are only 5 minutes long (longer if eventually the team ties up and the game has to end with any of the teams scoring the tiebreaker) and are incredible tense and fast paced. You will find yourself amazed by some of the plays made here and the sense of physics is well ported onto here.\n\nThere are its flaws, however: The game does bring a certain ammount of questions whether it has enough items to be unlocked or not, as you will find yourself unlocking all of the game's content in a matter of hours, there are some server issues from time to time (minimal most of the time though) and there is the issue of not being able to have car customizable slots, where you'll find yourself having to customize your car to scratch if you ever change its model; all things that can be fixed throughout the updates and the dev that I gained my trust on from the time i played this game.\n\nIn general, its a great add-up to your library that will fill hours of your life, that, in my opinion, were not wasted on.\n\n9.5/10","December 2, 2015","true","571.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","3"

Instead of a girlfriend at age 16, I had some 50 year-old chick who treated me as though I was having a sort of affair with her. Do you know what I mean? She definitely treated me as a "bit of stuff" rather than as an equal. I mean, this was completely fine with me. I was doing this awesome hot chick, and moreover one who was unavailable to my peers. Man, I bet they wish they had the sort of sexual education I did!\n\nAfter a while though, it started to grate, because she'd never take my opinions seriously, and that kinda rankled. Still I was 16, and she had, like, multiple degrees, so I couldn't blame her. Eventually, I moved away and we just sort of stopped seeing each other. I kind of wish we'd kept in touch and stuff, because there's been multiple times I could have used her wisdom and erudition. Still, all things must end, eh?\n\nAnyway, ever since then, my life has been a pattern of affairs; I never really quite found the pursuit of single girls as fulfilling and rewarding as when you get some married broad to cheat on her husband through simply being a better man than him. Now, I kind of regret not settling down earlier, because I seem to have a lot of trust issues, always wondering when they'll end it and go back to their spouses. Still, it's better to regret something you did, than something you didn't, I guess.\n\nSo, anyway, and this is a bit of a sad end to the story, so sorry 'bout that. She died recently - I only noticed because of the obituaries in the paper - and it turns out she left something to me in her will. Well, not her will exactly, but the solicitor called me up to say there was an envelope with my name on it. It was dated only a few weeks after we broke up.\n\nI'm not afraid to tell you I was kinda scared by this; my blood literally ran cold when I saw her ever familar script on the envelope. I was kinda shaking when I read it, and despite the fact it's kinda private (and a little bit sexy!) I kinda want to tell you guys what it said. It's important, and I think everyone should know. This is what it said:\n\n"You have like the most amazing ♥♥♥♥ in the world.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Trilemma/recommended/252950/","Trilemma","Sławetny Watażka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Trilemma/","266 products in account","Rocket League is, as description claims, a sequel to a PS3 game with an overly complicated title that probably contributed to the fact that not many people have heard about it. Neither have I, so when I watched a video of Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, I was surprised to learn that Psyonix basically got the whole formula down with their first attempt; mechanics have hardly changed since the first entry into what might be now considered a sort of a franchise.\n\nThat Rocket League is now enjoying far more success than its predecessor is very clear. Some of it may be down to the good timing since it doesn't have to compete with any AAA behemoth, some to PS+ free release and its very important strength: it is highly watchable and thus enjoyed free promotion from streamers and youtube personalities. But it doesn't fully explain the explosion of entusiasm it garnered.\n\nI think the main reason is that it's almost a perfect execution of its idea. It's addictive, but demanding. Fun from the getgo, but surprisingly deep in terms of its mechanics. If you have all these elements and add polish the result is an extremely engrossing competitive online game.\nYou start off by simply attempting to hit a ball, preferably in the direction of the enemy's goal, but in the beginning every hit feels like a success. As you learn to have more control over the car, which thanks to the tactile responsiveness of controls happens at a rather quick pace, you find yourself mixing in more advanced techniques to gain the edge over the enemy. Occasionally you will manage to pull off an impressive move and you will want that to make this a norm. Once you get your technique down to an acceptable level it's no longer enough: you need to "read the pitch", predict your opponents' moves, cooperate with your teammates (or not, if you choose to play only 1v1 which you're entirely free to do!).\n\nThis aspect of the game is hard to overstate.  Playing Rocket League constantly demands and leaves room for improvement, both individual and team-based and given that player base is currently huge and matchmaking great, you're going to matched against players just right for you.\nThere is always one caveat that applies to every online game in existence: your mileage may vary. If you're unlucky, you may very well have unpleasant experience with it. You might end up with a series of online problems or bugs. You might very well not be so drawn in by the mechanics or be in the minority of people this game doesn't resonate with. But I say: buy. It's unlikely any of it will apply to you, and if the price is the only source of doubt for you, wait for the first sale and get it then, though in my opinion it's well worth the price of admission.","July 18, 2015","true","69.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I have tried and usually just get a "deer in headlights" stare of bewilderment.\n\nYou could explain the mechanics; you play as a rocket powered RC car capable of jumping and flipping around the field, trying to score goals while flying acrobatically through the air... but that doesn't quite capture the pure excitement that Rocket League offers.\n\nNot since Hawken have I experienced Overtime this intense and victories this satisfying and I honestly don't know why that is... but it is.\n\nNegative points are few and far between but some may be: servers aren't quite capable of handling the thousands of people playing at once but the devs say they are working on it, and it has improved in the last few days. Another might be that the "random" unlocks are for any car but the one you prefer to use but that's just PD2 "random" logic I'm already used too.\n\nOverall, this game runs great; I get between 40 and 60+ fps on my upper-middle-class PC. It looks great even with all the AA's and motion blur turn on its not over the top. The controls work and feel great even for keyboard and mouse unlike some OTHER games... *cough* Speedrunners.

Its not simply soccer with cars.\n\nRocket League is an adrenaline-pumping, itch-feeding, finger-mashing, explosive sports game. It is the result of a great clusterball of imagination, vision and execution. You control a car, with rocket boosts that allow you to manouver in the air, jump and perform bicycle kicks. Unlike regular football fields, you are playing in a specially designed cages that allow you free movement. Since the fields are closed, the action runs seamlessly.\n\nThe biggest difference that derails from the old formula of sports game is the fact that you only control a single entity. You do not switch from one ragdoll to another to perform incredible feats. You communicate with one-another on an electric level that when executed perfectly sends chill down your spine.\n\nWith insane avatars capable of withstanding the severest laws of gravity, the presence of each individual in the field matter. Not once or twice, the game countlessly put you in exhilarating situations akin to football strikers: preventing a tiebreaker from being scored during the last moments of the round or giving an impossible sommersault pass with the last sliver of nitros that leads to an impressive aerial goal by your teammate.\n\nInstead of placing features that exist in today's meta, Rocket League opted for a more traditional approach. You will find no such character progression, career mode or ability unlocks in this game. What will keep you playing will simply be the charm of performing stunning moves, outmanouvering and outsmarting your opponents over and over again, one game after another.\n\nIt's just another 5 minutes after all...\n\nAdditional comments apart from Core Gameplay (+good / -bad)+ Wonderful aesthetics/colour palette\n+ Amazing Soundtracks\n+ Ability to practice while queueing\n- Server Issues\n- Matchmaking problems","October 22, 2015","true","75.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I said NO.\n\nThe next day he asked me again to install the game. Again, I said NO. For the next two months or so he kept on asking me to install the game on a daily basis to no avail and I began to dislike the game even more because of that.\n\nOne night I had literaly nothing to do, so I decided to install Rocket League but not to give it a chance but for my friend to stop asking me to. After the brief tutorial I lost track of time and realised I had been playing for about two hours. At the same time, my friend bought a Four Pack and shared the copies with some of our friends; at the blink of an eye we were all hooked into the game.\n\nIn less than a week, 25 of us (and growing) already have the game and fell addicted harder than with heroin to the point of keep on playing for 7 continuous hours:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXaAaAor_F8\n\nPROS:\n- Addictive gameplay.\n- Lots of fun.\n- Easy to play.\n- Keyboard n' mouse playable.\n- Colorful visuals.\n- Great music.\n- Several game modes either online or local.\n- Powered by Unreal Engine.\n- Cross platform: you can play with friends that are in either PS4 or PC.\n- "Mutators": you can change the behavior of several things.\n- Highly suggested to play with your friends.\n- Lots of fun/sarcastic/senseless customizations.\n\nCONS:\n- Just a few stadiums to choose from.\n- Most of the cars' aesthetics look like they were designed by a toddler.\n- You can only choose from two team colors (orange or blue) when playing closed/private matches.\n- DLC's are somewhat irrelevant unless you really wish those extra cars and soundtrack, otherwise, get the base game.","January 2","true","68.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Its not simply soccer with cars.\n\nRocket League is an adrenaline-pumping, itch-feeding, finger-mashing, explosive sports game. It is the result of a great clusterball of imagination, vision and execution. You control a car, with rocket boosts that allow you to manouver in the air, jump and perform bicycle kicks. Unlike regular football fields, you are playing in a specially designed cages that allow you free movement. Since the fields are closed, the action runs seamlessly.\n\nThe biggest difference that derails from the old formula of sports game is the fact that you only control a single entity. You do not switch from one ragdoll to another to perform incredible feats. You communicate with one-another on an electric level that when executed perfectly sends chill down your spine.\n\nWith insane avatars capable of withstanding the severest laws of gravity, the presence of each individual in the field matter. Not once or twice, the game countlessly put you in exhilarating situations akin to football strikers: preventing a tiebreaker from being scored during the last moments of the round or giving an impossible sommersault pass with the last sliver of nitros that leads to an impressive aerial goal by your teammate.\n\nInstead of placing features that exist in today's meta, Rocket League opted for a more traditional approach. You will find no such character progression, career mode or ability unlocks in this game. What will keep you playing will simply be the charm of performing stunning moves, outmanouvering and outsmarting your opponents over and over again, one game after another.\n\nIt's just another 5 minutes after all...\n\nAdditional comments apart from Core Gameplay (+good / -bad)+ Wonderful aesthetics/colour palette\n+ Amazing Soundtracks\n+ Ability to practice while queueing\n- Server Issues\n- Matchmaking problems","October 22, 2015","true","75.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borba/recommended/252950/","Borba","Borba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borba/","1717 products in account","TL:DR at the end, scored 9 / 10 as of 22nd April 2016\nBorba Recommends\nBorba likes:Genre - A mash-up of different genres, Rocket League combines elements of racing and soccer to produce a physics based vehicle soccer game, heavily inspired on the same company’s PS3 exclusive Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. It’s as unique as it is fun, even to those who aren’t that much into sports game, like Borba.\n\nReplayability - Online gameplay, ranked play, regular updates and a ridiculous amount of unlockable cosmetics allow this game to last as long as the player wishes and has fun with it, and that may range from a few dozen of hours to the several hundred.  The game can also be played offline and supports split-screen play.\n\nNarrative - As a futuristic sports-action game it doesn’t really require a story mode or in-depth lore and, despite it being done before in games of the genre, Borba doesn’t think the game should be penalized for this due to its “price versus content” value.\n\nGameplay - The physics in this game react solidly during online play, although not perfectly, providing a good experience if the players have a reasonable ping to their server. Originally, players though that all cars were equally balanced, although later and through several community tests, it was noted that all cars performed differently in certain gameplay occasions, and it was later confirmed by Psyonix that cars had indeed subtle differences. Either way, as a casual player, Borba just plays with whatever car he feels like playing and has fun doing so, while the most competitive of players might just analyze all the information out there to get an edge in specific scenarios.\n\nInterface - A clean and futuristic interface provides for every stat players need. The menus are fluid and well organized, supporting both keyboard and gamepad.\n\nGraphics - Forged in the Unreal 3 engine, the game looks absolutely gorgeous, with colourful vehicles, distinct and engaging stadiums and all sorts of visual effects to provide a pleasant stimuli to players’ eyes.\n\nSound - Motor noise, dynamic crowd cheering, power-up, car jumping and boosting all meld together into a pleasant experience that is often masked by the excitement of players’ commentaries or shouts, especially while playing with friends locally or through voice chat.\n\nDesign - Being an innovative concept of a sports game, originally created by the same company but as a different game on another platform, it’s a sign that gaming still has plenty to offer through bold developers who search to provide gamers with new, fun experiences. What is seemingly an alien concept, mixing racing and soccer, is now an extremely popular product that everyone can enjoy, from the casual to the hardcore gamer, as a result of a well executed idea.\n\nPolish - Psyonix managed to fix the network issues that plagued their original title, by having dedicated server network in place for Rocket League, which wasn’t financially possible before. As a result, and through a new optimized physics engine ( Bullet ), Rocket League is a solid performer on both local and online play. No major or minor bugs were found while playing the game, and it remains well optimized and playable even on low-end systems.\nBorba dislikes:Music - While navigating the menus, the game provides some nice, energetic electronic trance music that somehow just feels right. Sadly, no music is available during the actual matches, which is a shame considering the game has such a varied and pleasant soundtrack.\nBorba feels like Rocket League is a title fitting for any gamer’s collection as it is an excellent party game that will live on forever through local play. It will most likely stay popular for many months to come, and Psyonix updates with new unlockables and purchasable cars on a regular basis. The gameplay is fun, the performance is great and it may even run on certain low-end machines.\n\n9 / 10","April 22","true","26.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

The concept is simple, It's soccer with cars.  Seems simple enough yet this is one of the most fun games you could have played this year. Rocket League is a game that makes you say, "Just one more match" which turns into hours as its fun and addicting gameplay keeps you coming back for more.\n\nAs you play, you collect accessories for your cars while gaining levels which luckily is done right in this game. Any game that makes you move with the gameplay because of how into it you become is doing something right. There is DLC for this game which gives you more car types and accessories and one nice thing is that Psyonix gives you the new arenas for free.\n\nThis company deserves your money and have done everything right in my books to make this game one that I will continue to come back too for a long time to come.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chroppy/recommended/252950/","Chroppy","Chrop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chroppy/","102 products in account","Lets start off by saying this.\nIf you go to the negative reviews, all you'll find is people saying...\n\n1. "It's laggy" - Which used to be true, when this game was first released the servers couldn't handle 100'000's of people at once, so it lagged A LOT, but since then it's gotten a LOT better and a LOT smoother. You'll end up in a laggy match 1/50 times probably. You can also report the server you lagged in online and they'll fix it asap\n\n2. "My computer won't run it" - You'll need a decent enough computer to run this game.\n\n3. "I suck at this game" - Keep Practising, trust me, EVERYONE is terrible at this game when they first play it, it's a really unique game which has never been done before so no one really knows how to play, but the more hours you put the better you get, until you start flying in the air constantly and scoring goals from the sky!\n\n4. "After 30 minutes, you've seen everything and it's just the same thing over and over" - This is true. There's a lot of maps but they're all identical besides cosmetic changes. All the cars drive Almost the same way and the goal is to shoot the ball into the goal. It's better to compare it to a game like League of Legends or CSGO, you'll do the same thing over and over, but you'll but sooo many hours into it since it's fun.\n\nThe game itself is, put simply, Really really fun, any youtube video of other people playing the game will show you this. The basic description for the gameplay is you defend, dribble the ball, FLY around the map going for the ball in the sky. Save goals, gain boosts to use a boost to drive faster and higher, drive up walls to help reach a ball mid-air and try your best to score.\n\nThere's also a lot of customisation for your car including Different types of Cars, Decal's, Antena's, Paints, different coloured cars and for those TF2 fans HAT's. There's unranked 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 gamemodes aswell as ranked 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 gamemodes (4v4 isn't considerd competitive as it's too chaotic to plan anything out), playing with a good team-mate is what really makes this game great. It's a good game to laugh and casually have fun with a friend aswell as a great E-Sports material game for those who want a competitive game (and it is competitive, a major e-sports tournement has already been held and it's amazing)\n\nIt's cheap and you'll definitly get your money's worth, as of writing this I have 168 hours into the game and I'm not slowing down.","August 27, 2015","true","448.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebreadpolice/recommended/252950/","thebreadpolice","Bread","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebreadpolice/","374 products in account","For something as simple as soccer/football played with turbo-powered cars, Rocket League is way more in-depth and entertaining than it might appear on the surface. Fast-paced, clean-looking, and hard not to enjoy even when you're losing or making embarrassing mistakes, this game will give you plenty of moments where you're geeking out over some incredible shot, save, or block - and it will give you just as many moments of intense, stress-inducing close calls or just-barely-missed opportunities.\n\nPlayed like a much smaller (player-wise) version of soccer/football - with several variations like 1 vs 1, 3 vs 3 (the standard), 4 vs 4, etc. - Rocket League is an interesting mix of competitive sports and driving/racing, pitting players against each other on two teams in five minute matches. An interesting twist, however, is the rocket-powered aspect of the cars and the "boost" fuel that players have to pick up and manage throughout the match. While it might seem like something strictly used for speed, it plays into essentially every aspect of the game, from controlling yourself in the air to making/blocking shots as well as to take other players out. With both resource management and getting a feel for how the cars control or the ball works, the game can feel very random and chaotic at first, often leaving you feeling like any play you make is chance or luck; to me, however, this is where Rocket League's longevity and replayability really comes into play.\n\nYou might be clueless initially and have no idea what you're doing (yet still manage to make plays), but the game unfolds more and more as you play and get your bearings. While one match you're barely struggling to hit the ball in the air, soon enough you'll hit them every time and come to find that as you practice you have way more control over the game and yourself than the chaotic atmosphere might let on. The high-flying bounces, the impossible-to-save/strike shots - it all will eventually be something you can not only handle consistently, but also open you up to the other techniques in the game like aerial movement/shots and boost control.\n\nCombine the solid gameplay and skill progression with an easy-to-use interface and good soundtrack (which should totally have an option to enable during matches!) and Rocket League is a surprisingly fun, easy-to-play but hard-to-master game that's both something you can pick up every now and then as well as play for hours.","December 22, 2015","true","249.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I can definitely agree to them. This game screams fun regardless of if you've played 1 hour or 1000 hours. Even if you're losing, you find yourself having fun. And that's the mark of a seriously great game, in my eyes.\n\nRocket League can be played casually or competitively, boasting both unranked and ranked queues. It is a simple enough concept that people are already familiar with even before playing their first game (it's damn soccer dude, if you don't know you've been living under a rock very far away from Europe, possibly on the moon Europa). But then, it has such an incredibly high skillcap. You'd probably still be learning new manouevres and the like well into 2000 hours (give it time though).\n\nI don't play with a controller as I don't own one, but I know that 99% of people recommend controller over keyboard/mouse. And from an unbiased standpoint, I would agree, as the analogs make ball control and fine movement much easier than WASD or the like. Regardless, if you do choose to play keyboard like a dummie (read: like me), then consider making a custom bind that doesn't use the mouse.\n\nI could go on and on. But I'll let the game do the talking; go buy it. Believe me, for $20, this is an absolute ♥♥♥♥ing steal.

This is the moment your whole life has been leading up to. Weeks of training, months of dedicated work to get yourself into peak condition; all for this. Your brain goes into overdrive as you see the ball barrelling towards you. With a well-placed hit, you effortlessly send it flying to the other side of the field. Your teammate, seeing an opening, leaps toward the ball and continues to lead it towards the opposing team’s goal. Abandoning your position of defense, you begin a pursuit of your own; a pursuit of glory. Time itself seems to slow to a crawl as your comrade sends the ball skyward, right into position. But time is of the essence. and it’s not exactly on your side either. The countdown begins; 10, 9, 8, 7… With the last of your energy, you bound towards the ball at top speed. The odds may be against you, but damn the odds; you’re going for gold! With a graceful leap, you make a last ditch effort to score the winning goal. This’ll be a buzzer-beater to remember!\n\nYou miss the ball completely.\n\nREVIEW\nRocket League\n\nGENRE\nPhysics-Based Car Soccer\n\nDeveloped by the up-and-coming game development studio, Psyonix; Rocket League is the far more famous sequel to the lesser-known Playstation Network classic, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle-Cars. [Hopefully, I won’t have to say that again. Er, type that again.] In Rocket League, you assume control of a battle-car in what can only be assumed is the ‘Rocket League’; a high-octane, high speed, supersport with a high mortality rate. In reality, it's car soccer, but that’s not important; what is important is the fact that you’re a mother♥♥♥♥in’ battle-car playing supersonic future soccer. In this utopian society, Rocket League is a high-intensity sport adored by millions, but experienced only by the elite few. As it just so happens, the ‘elite few’ is actually the ‘not-so-elite you!' Train hard enough though, and you’ll master the wonky physics of car soccer, save so many shots that your teammates may as well just nail you to a cross and call you the son of God, and maybe even perform aerial maneuvers so sick the entire crowd goes home with leukemia! Only the strong will survive in the Rocket League!\n\nIn theory, Rocket League is almost the quintessence of simplicity within game design. You can drive, drift, jump, and boost. In practice? Not so much. Driving is as straightforward as it comes, mind the fact that you can drive on walls. Drifting is sufficiently simple as well, you can powerslide and change which way you spin whilst mid-air. Jumping, however is where things get complicated. When you jump, you have a variety of options to choose from for your next move. For example: simply pressing the jump button will send you directly skyward, another press and you’ll perform a double-jump. Pressing any direction whilst jumping will send you tumbling in that direction, performing two of these ‘flip-jumps’ in succession will send you barreling in a direction of your choosing without the need for boost. Speaking of boosting; hoo boy.\n\nYou can boost while driving to, well, boost your speed. Simple, yeah? If you reach maximum speed, hitting an opponent will reduce their car to a smoking pile of rubble. That’s ground-based boosting. Air-based boosting is a whole different ball-park. With a hop, skip, and/or a jump, a little angling, and fingers to press left mouse with; you’ll be able to use your boost to soar gracefully like an eagle! Or not, it takes some practice.\n\nSo that's the basics of the controls, but what about the game itself? Well, as previously stated, Rocket League is car soccer; no, really. You're in a car, there's two teams and a ball, and the objective is to score the most goals within a five minute timeframe. That's, uh, that's it. Sort of.\n\nThere's four primary game modes in Rocket League; Duel, Doubles, Standard, and Chaos. Simply put, these are just neat little names for 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4. [Coolio, huh?] There's also ranked variants of all of these archetypes excluding chaos, as it’s, well, a bit chaotic. Occasionally, limited time game modes will appear. At the time of writing, the most recent mode was ‘Snow Day’; a Christmas themed variant featuring lower gravity and a puck rather than a ball. It was pretty neat.\n\nY’know what else is neat? Customization. Y’know what Rocket League has a metric ♥♥♥♥-ton of? CUSTOMIZATION. From body to boost trail, hubcaps to hats, and everything inbetween; Rocket League offers the Cosmetic Junkie within all of us the good ♥♥♥♥, the premium cut. Then again, maybe it's just me that's crazy for that stuff. That ♥♥♥♥♥ my bread’n’butter. I need help. Oh, and don't go worrying your pretty little head about not getting that super-special hat you wanted; Rocket League rewards players with cosmetics after every match regardless of performance.\n\nHelp, by the by, is in ample supply! Striker, to goalie, learn to play on the fly! Sorry. What I mean to say is that Rocket League has a variety of training modes worn which to hone your skills. In addition to basic and advanced tutorials; there's striker, goalie, and aerial training, as well as basic sandbox mode. The game may be hard to master, but you can't say it doesn't help you along.\n\nLet's say you get cold feet though; let's say you're intimidated with the prospect of going straight to online and ballin’ it with someone from Bali. Well, reader, in that case; why not peruse the offline bot-match options? Firstly, there's exhibition mode; a standard bot mode where you make the rules and play at your of leisure. The AI scales in difficulty with 4 increments; Rookie, Pro, All-Star, and Unfair. Unfair is exclusive to exhibition mode, as it's an asymmetric hell-hole. [In a good way, trust me.]\n\nShould that not entice you, season mode awaits your beckon. In season mode, you create a team and duke it out in the Rocket League for chance at some good ol’ virtual glory! Simply choose what difficulty, how many players, what team, and how many weeks and bam; you're ready to go.\n\nThe music’s pretty swanky too, if I do say so myself. [Which is kinda redundant if you think about it; I mean, is it possible to not say something as yourself? Anyway, tangents are pretty neato.] There’s  good tracks in there, a couple okay, but the only true atrocity is that it only plays on the main menu. I mean, yeah, you could always just find the OST on Youtube and play it in the background, but it seems like a smidge of an oversight to be honest.\n\nSo that's Rocket League; the hip new rocket-sport that all the cool kids on the block have been spackin’ ‘bout! I've never fancied myself much a fan of sports, though I have been getting into football. [Not futbol, mind you.] But I digress, the point is; even if you don't much like sports, this could be the game for you. Simply put, if you're a fan of high-octane, easy to learn, hard to master, physics based, team-reliant, competitive gameplay; Rocket League will be a blast for ya’. It's been hours of fun between my friends and I, and I don't see the end anywhere nearby. Oh, and did I mention there was splitscreen co-op? ♥♥♥♥in' righteous, Psyonix.\n\nWhat did the well-informed consumer say after reading this review?\n“Well that really got the ball rolling!”","February 5","true","108.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","1"

That said theres an odd bit of lag which can be expected, its hugely improved since release.\n- The game is clumsy in the sense that is difficult to master, everyone has a level playing field in that there are no stat changes or perks etc. Ive never felt cheated by this game.\n\nCONS:\n- Perhaps there could be some variants on the types of maps, you could have goals at different angles, different shaped arenas, or traps/death pits etc. I think it would have to be tested but it would be DLC i would probably invest in.\n- Whilst its good as it is, maybe some more customisation on the cars would be good. All superficial of course, maybe editable number plates etc\n\nVERDICT?\nThis game burst on the scenes out of nowhere, I loved it so much playing it on PS plus that I had to have it on steam and give the devs my money. I know I will be playing this game for a long time to come.","August 3, 2015","true","206.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealbl1nk/recommended/252950/","therealbl1nk","bl1nk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealbl1nk/","363 products in account","Rocket League is a game which combines soccer and reckless driving. It is a sequel to the game SARPBC, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars and it is produced by Psyonix. It includes cross-platform play between PS4 and PC, having an huge playerbase currently.\n\nGameplay\n\nYou will have lots of fun with this game guaranteed! The controls are ultra-simple to use, you will get used to them in a blink of an eye. I play the game with a controller, which for me it is the best way to play it, but it is enjoyable to play with the keyboard + mouse too. The game itself is ultra fun! The ball physics with the rebounds and all feel impressively well, as the cars handling. It is incredibly easy to play, yet extremely difficult to master. You also have to use strategy in this game in order to win the matches, much like regular soccer. If you are just a ball chaser you will have difficult times winning, you have to think about your positioning and timing very well. You can also do incredible trick shots and jump shots due to your boost, which are incredible hard to master, but after some time you will start to get the hang of it. The worst part are some camera angles and the bots AI, but unless you plan on only playing offline games, the AI wont be much of a problem. It feels so good to make some incredible plays, even when you fail you will have tons of laughs. It is a very simple game with simple ideas, yet they work perfectly and make this game a blast to play for both casual and professional players.\n\nLongevity\n\nThe longevity of a game which relies on an multiplayer-focused game can be debatable, but in this one I am sure you will spend enough hours to compensate the money you spend in the game. At the moment I have spent 35 hours and intend to spend many more. You have tons of cars, paint jobs, hats and other customization stuff to unlock during the game that will keep you entertained for the first hours (I unlocked everything in around 20 hours). You also have 4 different game-modes (1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3, 4vs4) which give some good diversity since each one of the modes has its own strategies to follow in order to win them. You also have an offline season mode available to play, but it is kind of boring in my opinion given the multiplayer options you have. Practice mode is also available, a great place to tune your skills up. The ranks and leaderboards system will also entertain you, it is great to climb up against your friends in the diverse list of leaderboards available.\n\nGraphics and Presentation\n\nOnly have good things to say here too. By the moment you enter the game you will know you are in for something special. Slick menus with an ultra easy interface plus amazing songs will make you excited right at the first time you open the game. You got plenty of voice commands to use in-game which is definitely a plus presentation wise. Now the graphics. Another win in this spectacular game. Great graphics for a game this simple. All works really well, the colors, grass, car details, everything looks great. The level of detail in the cars and their customization objects is great too. These are some impressive visuals, even though the main focus of the game is definitely not the graphics.\n\nMusic and Sounds\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is amazing. I was totally not expecting it, there are really some great songs in it, got some of them stuck in my head. There are only around eleven songs in it, but most are awesome and don't get old. The various sounds in the game are also great, from the sounds of the different boost types, ball hits, drifts, crashes, everything works really well.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nThis is the big deal in this game. And oh boy, how fun it is to play it with or against friends. You will have tons of fun making the best goals ever as well as the biggest fails in history. It really gives you tons of laughs. You have also the option to play ranked instead of casual games, which make for some more intense, fun matches! The playerbase is huge, around 100000 players are online in most of the time, so you will find games in a matter of seconds. The community is in it´s majority very friendly, but like in all multiplayer games, you will find some toxic people playing the game too. You also have different server regions to choose from so you can play without worrying about lag. Unfortunately I did have some crazy lags in some european servers. It is rare to find a laggy server but it happens and can get very frustrating, specially when you are playing ranked. Yet, I am sure the devs will fix most of the server issues soon, so no worries about that.\n\nSummary\n\nPros:\nNewcomer-friendly gameplay, yet difficult to master\nGreat controls\nAmazing soundtrack\nGreat graphics and presentation\nAmazing multiplayer with lots of fast-paced, intense matches\n\nCons:\nThe Bots AI is pretty weak\nSome connection issues in multiplayer\n\nMy personal score: 9.7/10\n\nIf you enjoy high octane reckless driving and the world's most popular sport, Rocket League is for you. It is one of the most fun multiplayer games released in the last years. The base price is great value for the game you get, which will get you hours and hours of great fun! Embrace the latest gaming trend in Steam and PS4 and have a blast playing this soccer-meets-cars gem!\n","October 17, 2015","true","486.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CptChaosNL/recommended/252950/","CptChaosNL","CptChaos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CptChaosNL/","329 products in account","I have also translated my review into Dutch, please read second half for that\n\nENGLISHIntroductionAt first, I was a bit sceptical. How could this game even be a good one?\nI had seen the trailers, I had seen about everything about this game.\n\nBut still I thought that a game like this wouldn't be any success.\nA friend of mine recently bought the game and is enthusiastic about it.\nHe also said that this would definatly be a game which I would love to play.\nAnd here is my review...\n\nThe Game itselfThe game itself has a pretty simple concept, mixed together: racing and soccer.\nBasicly the player controls a car (kind of RC like to me) and you play soccer with it.\nYou can play against AI bots with different levels of difficulty, but you can also play in local co-op mode or online.\nThis game even has cross platform gaming, which means the players can connect to a game from multiple platforms.\nThe platforms currently supported are Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and - obviously - the PC.\n\nThe Menu within the gameThe game within the menu works quite nice and looks great.\nThere are no options I'd miss and everything you can think of you would want to set, are adjustable.\n\nThe Game mechanicsJust like every game - espcially in games like these - there's a curve to get to know the game.\nThe curve in this game isn't that hard and - even in online games - you can get to score quite fast.\nAlso the mechanics just feel right, I never got a feeling, that when something happened, it happend wrongly in any thinkable way.\n\nThe excitement one gets after scoring, is just amazing, even when the opponent team scores, well, at least for me, hahaha. While I am writing this review, my throat hurts because of all the yelling. To make that even worse,\nthe possibility to destroy opponent vehicles (when you've got enough velocity to just ram the opponent also makes me yell out of excitement, especially when you prevent the opponent (team) from scoring with it or when you can make sure to score with it (for example in front of the opponent's goal, when your team has the ball and are close to scoring).\n\nThe controlsI played this game using my X360 controller connected to my PC. The controls are quite easy to learn, hard to master,\nso you can get to scoring even faster. I honestly have to say I did not play any second using the keyboard, so I can't tell anything about playing with the keyboard. Even the menu is available with the controller, so that's a nice thing, because not every game has support for it.\n\nHow other controllers are doing with the PC version, is unknown to me, as I only do own a X360 controller.\nI do hope and think that newer controller, like the XONE controller or the new Steam controller are even better,\nbecause I hear that these controllers are more  comfortable while using.\n\nGraphicsThe graphics are nice, which doesn't come as a surprise, because the Unreal Engine is being used.\nBy the looks of it, my guess is that the new Unreal Engine 3 (UE3) engine has been used.\nAn older engine, but when you're in-game, you don't actually see it's UE3 being used, the game just looks to great for that.\n\nConclusionTo my total surprise this game is very amusing and I actually am now recommending this game to anyone who thinks of buying this game. It's not that expensive, but the excitement pays back very well and quite fast.\nIf you're a lover for arcade racing and fancy a soccer game (or the other way around) as well, then maybe this is something you will actually come to love. Even I didn't regret buying this game and I hope others won't as well.\n\nScoreTo get a impression about how I feel about this game, I'd rate it a a 9 out of 10.\n\nNEDERLANDSIntroductieIk was eerst wat skeptisch over dit spel. Want hoe kan een spel als dit nou ooit een goed spel worden?\nIk had wat trailers gezien en eigenlijk zo'n beetje alles wel, wat over dit spel te vinden was.\n\nMaar ondanks dat, dacht ik dat dit spel geen succes kon worden.\nEen vriend van mij heeft onlangs dit spel gekocht en was er best enthousiast over.\nOok vertelde hij, dat hij wel vond dat dit een typische game voor mij zou zijn.\nEn nu is hier mijn review...\n\nHet spelHet spel zelf is gebaseerd op simpele concepten, die samenkomen: racen en voetbal.\nSimpel gezegd bestuurd de speler een auto (wat doet denken aan een afstandbestuurbare auto) waarmee je voetbalt.\nHierbij kan er tegen bots gespeeld worden op verschillende niveau's, maar je kunt ook online spelen en zelfs met lokale split-screen.\nHet spel kent zelfs crossplatform gaming, waarmee spelers van verschillende platformen het tegen elkaar kunnen opnemen.\nHet spel is momenteel speelbaar op de Xbox One, PlayStation 4 en - uiteraard - de PC.\n\nHet menuHet menu in het spel ziet er modern uit en past in de style van het spel.\nIk heb niet het gevoel dat ik opties mis, eigenlijk alles wat je je kan bedenken, kun je instellen.\n\nDe game mechanicsNet als elk spel, heeft ook dit spel een curve, je moet er dus even in komen.\nDie curve is niet al te moeilijk en je kunt eigenlijk vrij snel al punten scoren voor het team of een ander ervan weerhouden.\nOok voelen de mechanics goed aan, ikzelf had althans nooit het gevoel, dat dingen die gebeurden fout gingen op wat voor manier dan ook.\n\nDe opwinding die je krijgt van het scoren is gewoonweg fantastisch, ook als je een doelpunt tegen te verduren hebt, dat had ik tenminste wel, hahaha!\nTijdens het schrijven van deze review, had ik nog steeds last van mijn keel, van al dat schreeuwen, hahaha! En om het nog erger te maken...\nIn het spel is er ook een mogelijkheid om een tegenstander aan gort te rijden, door met de juiste snelheid er tegenaan te rijden.\nAls je hiermee het scoren van de tegenstander kan voorkomen of als je zelf vervolgens scoort, dan\n\nDe besturingIkzelf heb dit spel gespeeld met Xbox 360 gamepad. De besturing zelf, is overigens niet erg moeilijk, maar beheersen kan even duren in combinatie met de mechanics.\nEenmaal alles onder de knie, zul je zien dat je snel kan en zal scoren. Ik moet hierbij wel bekennen dat ik niet met toetsenbord heb gespeeld nog, ik kan dus geen oordeel geven over hoe het spel speelt met toetsenbord.\nWel vond ik het erg fijn om met de gamepad ook het menu te kunnen besturen in het spel, je hoeft in feite dus niet steeds te schakelen.\n\nHoe andere gamepads werken in combinatie met dit spel, heb ik dus ook niet kunnen testen, want ik heb alleen een Xbox 360 gamepad.\nWel verwacht ik, dat het met gamepads als die van de Xbox One en de Steam gamepad het net even wat beter gaat, omdat die controllers wat comfortabeler in de hand liggen.\n\nDe graphicsDe graphics zien er goed uit, maar dat is eigenlijk geen verassing, aangezien de Unreal Engine gebruikt wordt.\nHet lijkt er trouwens wel op, dat de gebruikte engine Unreal Engine 3 is.\nEen wat oudere engine dus, maar wanneer je in het spel zit of het speelt, merk je dat eigenlijk niet eens.\n\nConclusieTot mijn verbazing moet ik toegeven dat dit spel een verassing is om te spelen. Ik had niet verwacht zoveel plezier te hebben in Rocket League.\nMocht je dus nog over deze game twijfelen, dan zou ik zeker aanraden het spel te kopen.\nHet spel is niet duur en je krijgt er een heleboel plezier van.\nAls je van arcade racing en voetbal houdt, dan is dit misschien wel een spel om verliefd op te worden... ;)\nJe zult - net als ik - geen spijt krijgen dat je de game gekocht hebt.\n\nHet eindoordeelOm een cijfer te geven aan dit spel, zou ik het een 9 geven, op een schaal van 10.","July 18, 2015","true","45.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Forget the referees and the dirty plays, this is a game built on adrenaline! The duking out of BattleBots and the overwhelming success of pulling off incredible, aerial manuevers. All in an attempt to score a goal with a seemingly arid ball is always exciting. You sport orange and blue RC cars for their respective teams, both of which come in a good number of models with customization options, such as a different shade of the existing colors, paint jobs, tires, antennas, flags and hats. I would say the variety of dome arenas are a visual marvel with a large amount of terrain to cover ground in. Though unlike its predecessor, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, Rocket League lacks any bumps, dips or hills on their playing fields. Despite this minor discrepancy, which I'm sure time will give light to with more DLC, I wouldn't miss out on the physics sporting event of the millenia for it!","August 17, 2015","true","43.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

He told me he doesn't like soccer a lot either, he also told me that this game was nothing like normal soccer.\nSo I bought it. That might be one of my best purchases of 2015, the game is extremely well-balanced and super fun to play. The graphics, physics, music etc it is just perfect.\nRocket League is a physics-based vehicle soccer video game for Windows and PS4. The concept is easy: "You have to use futuristic cars to knock a ball into the opponents goal", you can jump into the air and use boosts to make this process easier.\n\n\nPros:												 Any non-acient PC can handle the game. If you want to check if you can handle the game, go to "canyourunit.com".[www.systemrequirementslab.com]\nFun to play alone or with friends.\nDifferent skill opponents based on your own skill so it is impossible to lose all the time.\nA game only takes 5 minutes without overtime.\nThe game is easy to learn, low skillcap.\nMultiple gamemodes make sure you will never get bored.\nOnline mode against other players or offline mode against bots for training.\nRocket League is not pay to win, the DLC's only contain extra cars and customizations.\nYour car choice or customization does not effect your gameplay in any way.\nIt is possible to carry bad teammates.\nGaining skill is fairly easy, you will not have to play 8 hours a day to win a match.\nYou can mute other players.\nThere is no way to cheat in this game which makes it more fun for every user.\nThe sound is not annoying at all!\nThere is a lot of physics in the game.Cons: You can't kick an AFK teammate, it will get a lot harder for you to win a match.\nThe game does not have a report system for spam or griefing.\nThe game is meant to be played with a controller, some movements are unable to do with a keyboard. It is possible to get in the higher ranks with a keyboard but it is way harder, therefor I would recommend a controller.\nThe ranking system is still in it's beginning phase, it is fairly easy to rank up or rank down fast.\nYou will need the DLC packs to get all the achievements.\nOverall experience:\n\nI would recommend this game to everyone, whether you're young or old, like FPS games or MMO RPG'S. Once you get the hang of it it is really fun to play. It is however more fun to play with friends then to play alone.\nIt is super fun ingame with all the different cars and customizations. For just 20€ I consider this one of the best valued games on the Steam market.\nOriginally posted by www.polygon.com:Rocket League is so easy to pick up it's hard to put down.This quote is exactly how you should picture this game.\n\nNOTE: I do recommend using a controller instead of keyboard.\n\n\nRating:\n\nI would rate Rocket League a solid 9/10.\n\n\nWant more recommendations?

Essentially soccer with cars and a giant ball, this game has you drive around an enclosed arena, bumping into other players as you try to knock the ball into the goal. But in keeping with the arcade spirit, the physics are a bit on the unrealistic side, which is why your car can hop up and twist, you can drive up the sides of walls, and head-on crashes only cause you to bounce back (though, admittedly, the physics may be too unbelievable for those looking for a real athletic challenge). You also can play matches up to four-on-four, either online, via split-screen, or in a mix of the two, though the more populated matches tend to be a bit too chaotic. There's even an exhibition mode where you can play against the computer, and these matches also go up to four-on-four, though this gets old pretty quickly -- well, unless you customize your car with a pirate flag, purple boost smoke, and a sombrero. That's just funny.","April 22","true","165.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Nice and simple, win more than you lose and you will advance.\n-Season system against bots that's great for when you just want to sit back and relax without the worry of competitive matchmaking.(It is to be noted that EXP earned is halved when playing bot games)\n\nCONS\n-Cross-Platform without the option to disable. This is honestly my biggest issue with the game. There is a "disable cross-play" option in the game however it only functions in ranked, forcing me to play unranked with ps4 users on my team. Call me a PC elitist or whatever you'd like, but in my 44 hours of experience at the time of writing, 95% of afkers and leavers, as well as people with ping above 100 are ps4 players(spotted by the PSY Net profile picture) I would be willing to wait up to 5 times my normal wait times if it means I wont have someone leave or rubber band around the map at 900 ping.\n-ZERO penalty for leaving games. In Unranked you are free to join and leave games whenever you want, as often as you want, with no repurcussions. losing by 2? Screw it just leave. Have to pee? Just leave the game.\n-No option to disable joining in progress. Because there are no repurccussions for leaving games, you tend to join games in progress where your team is losing 7-0, luckily you can just leave without worry ;), but constantly leaving games I join with 30 seconds left down by 5+ pts get's annoying and has happened way more than I feel it should for how much I've played.\n-No Ranked Team-Play. You can join ranked games with your friends, but there is no ability to create a ranked team, and play with a roster of people. With the custom colors already implemented in the seasons mode it would be very easy to allow us to create teams, with a normal paint job and alternate in case the other team matches us, as well as pick our favorite map as home field, playing ranked 3v3's with my friends and our own custom colored cars and logos (also already implemented in seasons) would be fantastic. Less of a con and more of something that really should be put into the game\n\n\nRECAP\n-I highly recommend this game, as it has clearly made it's way to the upper part of my playtime list and shows no sign of stopping. It's a game you can pick-up and just relax if you'd like but at the same time it's a game that can have you at the edge of your seat, butt clenched screaming at the top of your lungs as you score a goal with 0 seconds left to tie the game and put it into overtime, only to have the other team score at kick-off.","October 19, 2015","true","64.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashesforpresident/recommended/252950/","ashesforpresident","Ashes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashesforpresident/","396 products in account","Detailed Review by Ashes\n\nSummaryRocket League is a multiplayer soccer game with rocket cars instead of human players developed by Psyonix and a sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. It includes a range of different cars, arenas, cosmetics and gets constant updates which add new content, tweaks and bug fixes.\n\nCars and all the different unlockables are purely cosmetic and make absolutely no difference in gameplay, all of the new arenas are free which means the community does not get divided when new ones come out. The currently released paid dlc packs are simply cosmetic items and do not change gameplay or give any advantages to the buyers beside bragging rights.\n\nOne thing that I like a fair lot is that there are no gimmicks and no unlockable advantages.  Everything you have in Rocket League, you have from the beginning itself and the only important factor is your skill. This is how competitive games should be made. Nothing makes a player who has more hours superior to you except his skill, it's plain and simple.\n\nGameplayRocket League is fairly easy to learn, but oh god is it hard to master. You can drive around, use your boost, jump, propel your car into the air with the boost, launch your car forward or in any other major direction and one often overlooked feature is the ability to spin your car around in mid air.\n\nThere are several match types: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4. Each of them excluding the 4v4 have ranked versions if you feel extra competitive. When a match starts you spawn at one of several possible locations on the arena and the ball spawns at the center. Both teams rush to the ball for the first hit. Like in traditional football there is one goal on each side of the field and the objective is to score into the enemy team's goal while protecting your own. Scattered through the arena are boost fill-ups which can be picked up from both sides of the field regardless of your team.\n\nIn terms of competitiveness Rocket League nails it, the complete lack of perks and upgrades make the outcome of matches rely purely on your skill and a hint of luck every now and then. Gameplay is exceptionally fun and enjoyable, you'll probably spend your first few matches hopelessly driving around the field not even touching the ball, but after a while you'll eventually get the hang of it and learn when to go for the ball, when to strike and how to position yourself among a lot of other things. As silly as the concept of rocket car football might sound, Rocket League is a very competitive game which even managed to secure its position as an electronic sport.\n\nThe way a match progresses is fairly simple and much like real life football. After every goal the players and ball reset and both teams rush towards the ball for the first hit much like in the beginning of the game. If you end up tying a match overtime takes place and the first team to score wins. Overtime doesn't have any sort of time limit so a match can go on until your fingers fall off and your eyes melt.\n\nMatches are a team based effort and while it may be easy to win one of them in lower ranks without being a team player you will find that without proper communication and strategy you cannot win in the higher ranks. This brings me to another point, one particularly frustrating thing is that players can abandon matches without any form of punishment and to make matters even worse when a player leaves a ranked match no new player can connect in his/her place, which makes you are stuck with a bot. A system that punishes people for leaving games would be very welcome.\n\nArenas, Cars and Car CustomizationThere are 5 different arenas and each of them has its own theme and some have different variations, but note that they do not affect gameplay whatsoever, but instead offer a nice and welcome change of scenery. All of them have a lot of detail and provide you with loads of eye candy.\n\nDifferent cars offer completely cosmetic changes and so do car customization options. There is a total of 14 cars including the dlc ones so far and more than a few hats, wheel types, boost effects etc., the only thing lacking variety are the decals. Unfortunately there are only 5 decals per car and the game doesn't let you move them around your car or re-size them in any way, but you can change their color.\n\nGraphics and SoundRocket League is absolutely gorgeous offering a lot of detail in both graphical and sound quality. The game is so detailed that you can literally see each individual piece of grass on the field. The soundtrack is perfect for a sports game like this and the sound effects are absolutely nailed. There are a lot of small details everywhere and if you have a powerful enough PC to max this game out you will surely be astonished by its graphical beauty.\n\nA very small, but nice little detail I've noticed is that each type of boost effect has its own different sound effect. Every time a goal is scored the ball explodes in a mixture of paint and fireworks and lets out a very satisfying explosion sound. As much as I try I can't find anything to complain about regarding the graphics and sound of this game.\n\nTechnical DetailsRocket League is very well optimized, has no fps lock and a constant reliable framerate, a full PC interface and it supports gamepads, it has more than enough graphical, sound and game options. You can fully rebind your keys with both keyboards and controllers. I have to warn people with weaker or/and older systems that it might be difficult for them to run the game even at lower settings because it's pretty demanding.\n\nEverything you'd expect to be included in a game like this already is. We have cross-platform play with PlayStation users as well as split screen co-op on PC. After playing this for a fair bit of time, I even think that the PC version was simultaneously developed with the PS4 one instead of being ported, correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nAll bugs and problems usually get fixed withing a span of several days and the game is constantly supported by the devs. One of my only problems with Rocket League is its servers. Sometimes, despite having really low ping I get disconnected or start lagging all over the place. This can be especially frustrating in ranked matches where losing can lower the rank you've worked so hard to reach.\n\nConclusionI've enjoyed all of my time playing this. It was incredibly fun to play with random people online, but even more fun with my friends. Gameplay is spot on, PC version is amazing and probably better than the console one, every feature I would want is implemented and the whole thing is just beautiful.\n\nThis sort of purely skill-based gameplay is what more competitive games should be. No perks, no nuttin'. Just you and your team against the opposing team. Matches are short and intense and there is no big learning curve which means the game is really easy to get into for newcomers.\n\nI recommend this to anyone. If you are just looking for something casual and fun you'll definitely like it and if you are looking for something competitive and hard to master you're just bound to love it.\n\nPROS\nSkill-based gameplay\nExceptionally fun\nEasy to learn, hard to master\nInfinite replayability\nA decent selection of cars\nA lot of customization options excluding decals\nMindblowingly beautiful graphics and great soundtrack\nGreat fun with friends\nCross-platform play and split-screen\nPC version is amazing\nCONS\nServers aren't that great\nA sparse selection of decals for cars\nDemanding system requirements\nNo punishment for players abandoning matches\nWhen someone leaves a ranked match no one can connect in his/her place","October 14, 2015","true","255.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

This is an amazing game and the bots are sometimes challenging but sometimes ridiculous, i would like a level above all-star difficulty as i feel now that it is fairly easy to play against them. I would really recommend playing with a controller thoough, it's really hard to quickly do things so the controller is essential to play in general.\n\nI'd rate this game 94/100","April 19","true","200.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yamalight/recommended/252950/","yamalight","yamalight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yamalight/","1769 products in account","Rocket League is a crazy blend of soccer (or football depending on where you live) and RC cars.\n\nThe basic idea of the game is very basic - use your car to poke the ball into opponent's gates.\nYou'd think this might be awkward with RC cars physics, but that's actually not the case. From my point of view, this game has some of the most polished and balanced "fun physics" model I'd seen lately.\nYou have pretty much absolute control over your car and it's movements (well, aside from times when you are flying). Which means that it's quite easy to control the ball (if you are not terrible as I am).\nIn addition to basic RC car controls you have an ability to (double) jump and boost (which can also be used to propel yourself to the sky).\nYou can also use your car to push other cars away from the ball. And if you have enough speed - you can blow enemies up (can be achieved by using boost boost).\nThere are also some cosmetic customizations, different car bodies, tires and stuff like this.\n\nSo, it all comes down to the question - does poking the ball and high speeds towards gates sounds compelling to you? If yes - grab this game, it's pretty awesome. If not - well, it's not for you, go get something you'll enjoy.\nI have to also note that I'm not exactly a huge fan of soccer. But I had an absolute blast playing Rocket League.\n\nOh, and there's also split-screen support.\n\nI have not noticed any issues or problems with the game during my playtime.\n\nMore detailed look in the video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybDEoTh0Kso","August 27, 2015","true","2.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","2"

Did I just say "hats"? That's right, It's almost like Team Fortress 2, with one exception - the hats are free and are unlocked randomly after finishing a match.\n\nThings I like:+Good Concept\n+Amusing\n+Time killer\n+More types of game modes(1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4)\n+Simple control settings (It's easier to play it on controller)\n+Cross-platform - You will play with PS4 Peasants (Sarcasm)\n\nThings I didn't like at all:-AI is sometimes really stupid\n-Suarez has bitten me.\n\n7/10","August 13, 2015","true","95.3"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","10","16","4","0"

It is also a surprisingly deep game considering the mechanics are literally: go fast, slow down, (double) jump, slide and boost. There is a tonne of nuanced gameplay you won't get your head around until hours in to the game, with flying and juggling a few of the possibilities. With an incredibly well realised visual aesthetic and presentation that oozes class. It's money well spent even if you're just playing on-line alone. Though with a team, or a few friends round, it could easily eat hours of your night.\n\nWhile lacking game modes, the base game is enough to keep you distracted for some time.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough.","July 17, 2015","true","6.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The community is frequently referred to as "toxic" but I completely disagree. I honestly get matched with droppers/rage quitters maybe one out of ten games. The same goes with rude ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Are they here? yeah. Are they everywhere? No. I've played games where, after two people drop, someone from the other team will go be goalie for the team of 1. I've seen games where all the newbs have a laugh at their own lack of skill and keep fighting, because that's the only way to get better. I've seen more GG's in this game than I have in any other game, and that includes my grandmother's online bingo matches, where LOL actually means lots of love. Bottom line is, this game is ridiculously fun with a very steep and long learning curve. I'm at almost 120 hours and I'm still terrible, but I'm getting better every day.

I´ve had it since the Sale started and I already have 16 hours on it and I´m addicted.\n\nThe controls are perfect, the car responds exactly like you expect it, so if you mess up, it's your fault.\n\nThe game design is great, from opening the game to being inside a online room, it takes usually less than a minute, you're always playing and almost never waiting.\nThe menues are clean and you can understand everything right away, the only thing in that regard I didn´t understand at first is that the bodies, tires and all the rest of the things you can change, have absolutely no bearing in how your car will drive, they´re all just decorative, which was a little confusing at first (the placebo effect made me think the newer cars were faster).\n\nBeing in Chile, my ping is always really bad (it seems that the only servers in South America are in Brazil), I'm around 150/200 and people nearer the server have 20/30 ping, so sometimes it gets laggy, but the game is playable the same, I can make goals and win games even if I don't have the best ping in the room, they made a great job making it so everyone has the same chances. But I hope still that they open some servers in other countries.\n\nThe only bad point for me (it seems I'm in the minority) is that I don't like the music, I have to mute it, it's all fruity techno and I feel like this game should be more heavy metal, but it's OK, you don't need the music, and during gameplay you only hear the cars.\n\nIf you're on the fence, buy it, it's an amazing, well-designed game, made for competitive people, the rush you feel when you finally learn the controls and make a great play that ends in a goal is incredible.\n","January 4","true","90.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","2"

Use turbo, flip about, and do whatever it takes to win. Its so simple to play, but a challenge to master. Whether alone or with friends, the game is an absolute blast. Its one of the rare games out there that supports cross-platform (anyone you play with a PSYNET tag is a PS4 player...poor peasants). It also has customization...hats for cars. HATS. FOR. CARS.\n\nThis is truly the next big e-sport. I can't put this game down. If any older folk like myself remember the Unreal Tournament mod 'Carball', this will fill that void.

With an incredibly well realised visual aesthetic and presentation that oozes class. It's money well spent even if you're just playing on-line alone.

It feels like everytime you play, ridiculous plays happen, causing both teams to get hyped up. It's easy to learn the basics, but there is an insane skill cap meaning truly great players can run circles around you... so that means there's a ton you can get better at, so you can replay it endlessly. The game is quick to load, so you can hop right in and play. Games are fast but intense. There are unlockable items, but one item unlocks pretty much everytime you complete a match. There's light car customization (cosmetics only!), and honestly this is probably the weakest part of the game... it could be so much better, but it's enough to have fun with and provides a decent amount of uniqueness. There's some affordabale DLC for more personalization.\n\nNo real complaints about the game... you can sometimes get bad teammates, but you can always re-queue and get different people. It feels like the game is probably going to keep growing, and is only at its early stages of life.\n\nIt's highly advised to play with a controller... I haven't used keyboard and mouse, but very few people seem to... you can still do well with them, but the precision of a controller with steering and rolling your car is a huge advantage right off the bat.","November 17, 2015","true","55.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The community is frequently referred to as "toxic" but I completely disagree. I honestly get matched with droppers/rage quitters maybe one out of ten games. The same goes with rude ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Are they here? yeah. Are they everywhere? No. I've played games where, after two people drop, someone from the other team will go be goalie for the team of 1. I've seen games where all the newbs have a laugh at their own lack of skill and keep fighting, because that's the only way to get better. I've seen more GG's in this game than I have in any other game, and that includes my grandmother's online bingo matches, where LOL actually means lots of love. Bottom line is, this game is ridiculously fun with a very steep and long learning curve. I'm at almost 120 hours and I'm still terrible, but I'm getting better every day.

I'm IGgy, you may remember me from avoiding pure multiplayer games like the plague that they are and I'm here to recommend Rocket League, a game that combines two things that I hate! Football (Soccer if you're weird) and pure multiplayer games! The reasons I can stand this football game is because instead of humans that crawl over the field at a sluggish pace while some old dude gives color commentary over it you have ♥♥♥♥ing rocket cars and you can put skulls onto them.\n\n\nThis is my car at the moment of heroically throwing itself between the goal and the ball. And it has a skull painted on it you better ♥♥♥♥ing believe it. And yes that is a mother♥♥♥♥ing propeller hat on top of that car. I know this whole "oooh, silly hats, haha. I get it!"-thing is really ♥♥♥♥ing played out but this ♥♥♥♥ing propeller spins. They patched that in because people were complaining that it doesn't spin. They also made it so all the explosions now spell BOOM! in big explodey letters.\n\nI got it for free with PS+ on PS4. I played a couple games and then decided this is worth the full price so I can play it on PC! I then got it on PC!!\nIt has this easy to pick up, hard to master deal going for it. At first you'll just drive around maybe jump occasionally, while attempting to move the ball to where you want it to be until you've won that struggle that is winning your first match. After a short time you'll do some insane ♥♥♥♥ you think is super awesome and then you see someone who's actually good at the game and holy ♥♥♥♥, if what I did was awesome than this is at least Awesome with a capital A. Maybe even an A+. Then you'll crank up the FOV and zoom out the camera and you'll instantly be slightly closer to the skillz of those mastas.\n\nIt even has cross-platform play in public and private matches. On the same platform you can just invite friends to form a party with you and then trash some pubbies that just pile up on the ball like it's the second coming of that piece of toast with some bearded dude's face on it. If you have twenty bucks to spare feel free to get that game and stuff.","November 29, 2015","true","563.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","3","3","3","2"

Therefore the only way you actually get better/stronger in the game is from your own determination and practice. Even so, you can still have some fun when you start playing and it will only get better from there when you start mastering more advanced aspects.\n\nLastly, the community is alright though it is still better than most. If you learn and understand the key aspects behind how teamwork works in the game such as Positioning and rotations(these should be fundamental), then people in your team shouldn't be giving you much trouble. However the game may get bit too competitive in which players may start throwing insults especially if your beating them by alot. Nonetheless, there are still people out there that will always complain about stuff but its tolerable in this game.\n\nIn Conclusion, there is more to this simple game where it creates more enjoyment as you become better as a player.\nUnderstand key concepts and you will enjoy this game. I apologize for the large body of texts, perhaps dot points may have been better.","January 11","true","205.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It took me around 2,5 hours to complete the 18 weeks season with rookie level difficulty of bots. It's was a bit booring, to I wanted to complete one season at least to get all the achievements.\nNext thing, an Online gaming with real players it's really cool and this is the reason why everythong is buying that game, it has a two different mode normal and ranked. The only one difference is that in first one you are playing for fun, second - for rank. In both modes there are ♥♥♥♥ loads of fun.\n\ntl;dr\n\n♥♥♥♥ loads of fun\n\n10/10","December 28, 2015","true","19.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/252950/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","Let’s not waste energy exploring why soccer should replace its paper chain of squalid billionaires with cars, and accept it as fact. A fact which Rocket League proves with simple and immediate ease.\n\nI’ve never played a game that needed a tutorial less. Association football, soccer, wendyball; whatever you want to call it, it’s that, but on wheels. Drive car at giant ball; hit ball into net; score points. Rocket League’s competitive core has existed for centuries, and this helps make a preposterous concept feel primal. This, in turn, is a laughable way of describing a game which would be called moto carball if it actually existed.\n\nLike dry martinis and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ scribbled in an unattended notebooks, Rocket League is a celebration of simplicity. Driving is delicious. Cars ease around like butter in a heated pan, but always feel under your control. You accumulate boost by driving over markers on the arena floor and unleash it is a thunderous rush that fires you across, over and around the pitch. Because matches take place in smooth, enclosed spaces, you can drive up walls and across ceilings. Cars can also jump and dodge, both of which can be used defensively and offensively. The weight of the cars, as well as your ability to apply unruly boost to jumps, adds a pleasingly haphazard element; like athletic footballers leaping to header high balls, but with less shirt-pulling and zero chance of flattening a £2000 hairdo.\n\nCars ease around like butter in a heated pan, but always feel under your control.\nVehicles feel light and buzzy—somewhere between Micro Machines, and those swift, slidey remote controlled cars which only seem to appear on Christmas Day. This contrasts nicely with the fat, beefy bounce of the ball, which gormlessly invites impact like a punchable cousin. And that’s it. I feel almost guilty reducing a review to ‘ball’ and ‘car’, but there are only ever those two things in the field of play, and crucially, they both feel great. It’s helped by a crisp, intuitive camera. You can focus on the ball, effortlessly whizzing around with it always in view, or switch to the standard camera - very useful for rushing back to defend your goal, or smashing into other vehicles. There are no weapons, but certain markers fill your boost and let you obliterate other players. Mercifully, it’s the generous, instantly-respawning type of obliteration. Destruction is the only conspicuous deviation from clean business of driving around and scoring goals, but in most of the games I played it was a rarity—certainly never frequent enough to be irritating.\n\nDestroying other vehicles is one of many actions which accumulates points; imagine Burnout, but with awards for skill not speed. You receive points for things like clearing the ball from your goal line, spectacular saves and overhead bicycle kicks—named so because the more literal ‘quadracycle wheel-nudge’ is a senseless stew of words. Giving everything a points value means it’s about more than scoring goals. The most valuable players I encountered were workmanlike wingers who selflessly chugged along the the flanks, crossing the ball for greedy goalhunters like me. It stops players from clustering in the same spots and reinforces the concept that Rocket League is a team game.\n\n\n\nExcept, of course, when it’s not, such as when you’re duelling against a single opponent. Alternatively, you can set teams of four against each other, in matches which become so frantic that they’re less like footy, more like a lost, confused beach ball bashed between bumper cars. Playlists of duels, doubles, standard 3v3 matches and the appropriately named Chaos 4v4 mode are all available online, with ranked playlists limited to duels, doubles and 3v3. There’s a reason why online play is the first option on the menu: Rocket League is designed to be played with actual people, and this is absolutely where it thrives. My experience was marvellously robust. I rarely had to wait long for a game, and if players dropped out mid-session they were immediately replaced by AI bots. Best of all, it’s refreshingly simple to get back into another game, so very little time is spent lingering in lobbies.\n\nIf playing online isn’t your thing, there are exhibition matches and full seasons you can solo. The length and difficulty can be altered, and while it doesn’t offer much in the way of depth—cars and football, remember?—I still found myself bonding with pretend teammates. Whether online or offline, playing games randomly unlocks new cars and upgrades. These range from simple things like fresh coats of paint and shiny wheels, to pointy hats for your wizardmobile. Upgrades are purely cosmetic, but volume, variety and the promise of driving around with bubbles frothing from your exhaust should be enough to keep you coming back.\n\nThe offline modes do reveal the game’s minor inadequacies, however: team AI can be flaccid and unreliable, especially against tougher opponents, and the same simplicity which makes Rocket League immediately playable can cause things to get repetitive when played alone; a criticism that only becomes apparent precisely because it’s so damn addictive. It’s a simple thing done brilliantly well, kept interesting by the thrill of competition.\n\nTHE VERDICT\n87/100\nROCKET LEAGUE\nRocket League is fast, fun and relentlessly enjoyable. The best football game without feet.","April 24","true","4.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I mean it might already have some smaller leagues but I'm hoping this might be another game to take off into the world of eSports. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys that side of gaming or someone would just likes something to play while you feel in the mood for a change of pace, and also the casual PC gamer who just plays anything you're able to get your hands on. I can only imagine it's already got people buying it from all the big streamers playing it like LIRIK, summit, Soda and the rest.\n\nGoing back to the game I feel like the devs have done an amazing job with this game, the gameplay is solid, it's enjoyable for short term gameplay or hours of gameplay and it's cheap for a game in todays world where anything on Steam can cost up to £50 but you could say it's not a type A title, Gameplay is mostly easy, the basics are easy to lock down but when you attempt to learn the timings for rocket boosters, jumping off walls and other things you could spend days, weeks or maybe even months attempting to get them to a system you feel is reasonable.\n\nThe game has a decent setup for people, the FOV can be changed aswell as camera angles.. The only thing that annoys me personally is I use the talk button on my controller for mumble but everytime I set the button seems to reset so I have to keep doing the same change everytime I boot the game back up, I suppose there is a simple fix for it out there, I've read editing files or making the config read only is a temp fix.\n\nIn terms of how the game plays? Very smooth, I'm sadly one of the AMD gfx card owners and while some games are just poorly optimized for my card this is good. Controller support is also good and I recommend using one to play.\n\nOverall this game is one of my favourites this year at just £15. People thinking of waiting for the sale if you have money to spare I would just buy it now, I honestly don't think you'll regret buying this game, I'm one of those people who normally wait and I was going too but the amount of gameplay I kept seeing on Twitch, I just decided just to buy it anyways and I'm glad I did.","July 22, 2015","true","154.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's also the section of the plant that contains the seeds. The other parts of plants are considered vegetables. These include the stems, leaves and roots — and even the flower bud.\n\n\nThis game teaches you life lessons.\n\n10/10\n\nWould buy for a friend.","February 20","true","105.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirbrian/recommended/252950/","sirbrian","CptBrian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirbrian/","823 products in account","9/10 - Final revision\nThis game is the successor to Psyonix's 2008 PS3 game titled 'Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars' (SARPBC)\nIt's like soccer or hockey, with cars, and it's intense.\nYou can boost, double jump, flip, and fly by aiming your boost mid-air. You can drive on the walls and ceiling, or blow up other cars. Your objective is to hit a giant ball into the opposing team's goal. Whichever team scores the most, wins. There's an endless overtime for tied games.\nIt's really simple to pick up and has controller support(rebinding, too!), but it takes tons of practice to actually get good at it, and even then there's endless room for improvement. The skill ceiling is much higher than you'd expect. You'll still be getting better after a thousand hours.\nThere's ranked and non-ranked cross-platform multiplayer. Multiplayer matchmaking options include 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4.. You're able to search for all of them at once if you wish. You can also limit the matchmaking region to whichever is closest to you so you'll get a better ping. You're able to make private lobbies on dedicated servers to invite players from any platform, and modify the game's rules with mutators.\nThe game uses Unreal Engine 3, so it looks and runs great. You have plenty of options to improve your performance if you need to do so. You'd be fine running the game around ~40FPS anyway. There's a fair bit of vehicle customization with unlockables as well.\nPC players have an option to disable cross-platform matchmaking. Unfortunately cross-platform parties only work in private games.\nDLCs are just cars or cosmetics. All new maps are automatically downloaded free for everyone.\nIf you plan on playing competitively without a full team using mics, you're going to get frustrated. One incompetent teammate or a little miscommunication can easily cause a loss, and you'll see this often.\nSometimes it will show other players block the ball and hit it away, but then teleport the ball back on the path it would be on as if it were never blocked, throwing everyone off and usually resulting in a free goal.\nIt's addicting and populated, there's skill-based matchmaking, game-deciding lag, a little toxicity(because it's competitive), and plenty of questionable physics.\nYour hitbox will sometimes(rarely) clip through the wall a little bit, causing you to hit something, bringing your car to a halt, as seen here[gfycat.com]. The game seems to stop you from turning as you're ascending the base of a wall as well, it can really screw up your shots if you're in a hurry.\nNew modes were added to the game; Snow Day(Hockey mode with a big puck) and Hoops(Basketball with big nets), as well as some very different, experimental maps under the "Rocket Labs" playlist. Hoops is a very good mode that's nearly just as good as the standard mode, so expect a lot of play time!","September 18, 2015","true","737.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Essentially a soccer game where you drive a car to bump a giant soccer ball around, Rocket League has plenty of epic saves and amazing goals that keep you coming back for more. There is even a ranking system plus a competitive matchmaking mode for those who want to test their mettle against similarly skilled players.\n\nPsyonix has also pledged to not introduce powerups or any changes to game balance, which is fantastic as all the cars handle the same essentially. I've heard rumors that some of the hitboxes and handling are slightly different between cars, but it is negligible at best. I've missed these kinds of games, where there are no silly "perks" a la Call of Duty or car customization that can give you an edge in any way. It's just you, your car, and the ball. The new DLC cars are mostly novelties and haven't given an edge to any particular model of car, which is fantastic.\n\nI've been following this game for quite some time so I bought it almost instantly when it was released. I highly recommend you pick it up if you're a fan of competitive sports games. Seeing as it's been top seller on steam for a couple weeks now, I'm sure this game will continue to have a healthy, active community for a long, long time.","July 22, 2015","true","54.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
