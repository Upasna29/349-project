Yeah it's a little out there but it's all in good fun and challenge more than anything, each weapon feels different enough to the point where you need to switch up your weapons and magic fairly often to take down certain enemies, along with just carefully planning your stikes, blocks, and dodges, there's nothing more terrifying and satisfying than being swarmed by a bunch of black widow spiders only to barely kill them all....then resting and they respawn....\n\nReally one of the most interesting things about the games is how you feel like it's just a normal type of game where you just need to get to the end but the thing that kinda threw me for a loop was meeting another character who I was to escort to a village, and once I got her there I was told more of the backstory of the game and it was completely optional to keep talking to her and getting another quest, a small detail but very interesting to me personally.\n\nI could tell you more but that would kinda ruin the suprise and charm.\n\nAll that said, i'm loving the game so far, pleasently suprised, and i'll be playing more of it!","January 27","true","11.7"," 47 of 56 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","47","56","0","0"

You've got a quick, weak attack, and a stronger one that drains more stamina. You can also block enemy attacks, at the cost of losing stamina.\n\nAs you play through the game, killing enemies and looting their bodies will allow you to enable new abilities. These add further variety to the combat. One ability allows you to dash forward and attack quickly, while another allows you to continuously swing your sword heavily. Although it leaves you vulnerable, each consecutive attack deals more damage. It's a great trade-off situation.\n\nEnemies occasionally drop marrow. This works like souls in the Dark Souls series. You can use these to increase your stats at campfires, Stats such as health, how much weight you can carry, or attack speed. Depending on what type of weapon you want to wield, you'll also need to put points into that weapon class. My favourite being magic :)\n\nResting at a campfire will heal you, but also respawn all enemies.\n\nIf you're killed, you will drop all the marrow you currently have, and respawn at the last campfire. You have a chance to fight back to where you died, and pick it all back up. If you die again though, your previous marrow drop is gone. I personally love this kind of punishment, as it allows you to possibly redeem yourself.\n\nThere are a lot of paths and secrets you can find, which makes exploring rewarding, despite it being dangerous.\n\nThere's an absence of music, but I love the ambiance and world sounds. They really add to the creepy atmosphere, along with the awesome visuals.\n\nOverall, it's a really fun game. Hardcore, unforgiving, but it never got frustrating.\nRecommended!\n\n(Review code was provided by the developer. Although my review & video remain my honest opinion about the game, and were not affected by the code)","January 26","true","3.1"," 73 of 101 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","73","101","4","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chiprw/recommended/406130/","chiprw","Saph","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chiprw/","213 products in account","Darkmaus is a pleasantly surprising start to the indie year, the game draws heavily from the Dark Souls games and has the difficulty of one to boot. There is a good amount of content and replayability, especially for the £6.99 price tag. Not to mention the game is still being worked on to squash out a few bugs other people (Not me.) have been experiencing.\n\nYou are a maus (German for mouse, credit goes to Othrandur for pointing that one out.) who wakes up on a shore next to a boat armed with a toothpick and a shield. Your first move is to explore the surrounding area and try to find some purpose whilst learning the basics and fending off bugs, arachnids, other maus and various other eldritch horrors.\n\nAs somewhat of a Dark Souls veteran, I personally feel that the game does a good job of maintaining the atmosphere of the source material while still presenting new and often challenging elements throughout the experience. The game is not exceptionally long, however there is plenty of content that will have you hugging every wall looking for secrets. Being heavily exploration based you may find the world to be a bit overwhelming early on, but just keep checking that map and you're bound to discover a route you previously missed.\n\nThe combat is weighty and fairly simple once you get used to it, there are a few imbalances here and there (Almost exclusively in the player's arsenal.) but it's easy enough to learn with a little patience. The biggest change in the Dark Souls formula to me is the frequency of bonfires and the scarcity of healing items. Often each area will serve as a test to your abilities, pushing you to do better in order to succeed. Healing items are extremely sparse and should be used accordingly as a result, always try to keep a couple handy for reviving friends.\n\nThe selection of weapons is widely varied and most weapons offer something unique to them. This serves to add variety to the combat and differentiate weapons in the same classification from one another. My favourite example is the scimitar, which swings faster after each successive hit. The Katana has more base damage, but I really enjoyed getting behind some bosses and comboing their butts to death.\n\nThe most recent patch at the time of writing this added a quick heal feature which was highly requested from fans (Myself included.) which is a welcome change. Healing items are still rare, however you no longer have to access the inventory mid battle to use them. This small change shows that Daniel (The bloke who made the game) listens to his feedback, something many AAA developers could stand to learn from.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIt's like Dark Souls with mice and simpler two-dimensional combat, if you like the Souls series or just challenging games in general then I highly suggest checking this game out.","February 12","true","9.8"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","27","27","2","1"

Items and the stamina gauge don't stand out as much as they should.\n2D top down view makes certain enemies' attacks difficult to see.\nUnlocking weapons requires you invest levels in certain skills, which up to a certain point provide no benefit beyond being able to use that weapon.  it can be frustrating to put points in a weapon skill only to find out that you don't like how the weapon works.\nIn short: What you see in the trailer is pretty representative of what you'll get.

The combat does a great job of providing a challenge for the player, and the gameplay is precise enough to reward smart and tactical movement by the player. The level design helps in providing wide open spaces when you need it (when facing enemies that charge you like bulls), but shrinks it down to small corridors to cause some claustrophobia as the traps and enemies surround you at every turn. The difficulty is high: and yet fair: not relying on tricks, but forces you to adapt to your environment. While some of the sound design needs a bit more impact and there's some goofy menu implementation, the game's weaknesses don't overshadow the core combat in any way. If you're looking for a 2D combat fix, you could do a LOT worse then Dark Maus, because it's got the combat down.\n\nLists:\n+:\nCombat is surprisingly precise and makes the combat difficult and yet satisfying on several levels. Timing, luring, and good reflexes all play a huge part in being successful, and button mashing won't work ever. Technically, was surprised on how accurate the hitboxes were.\nWeapons and skills lead to variety in combat. Good enemy selection early on helps this along. Using skills wisely can help not only through combat, but in exploration sections as well.\nBoss battles were memorable, forcing you to use what you had learn up to that point in new ways.\nThe aesthetic may be simple, but it captures the loneliness of the world and the dire circumstances the world is in. In particular, I love the lighting affects in the game, never knowing what's around the corner, and how it causes even more tension.\nLevel Design does a great job of complementing combat as well, making the situations a bit more tense with strategically placed traps and claustophobic conditions.\nOk, the name is appropriate for the game.\n-:\nThe menu implementation needs work, especially with the map. It became a huge chore to bring it up via the controller implementation. Maybe a mini map would have worked better.\nThe sound design could use some improvements. Turning off the sound entirely didn't seem to have any effect of the game's combat.\nThere seems to be a lore here....I just wish there was more story.\nYou'll get lost, and the map implementation doesn't help. It becomes a little bit more of a problem because enemies respawn.","January 28","true","4.3"," 34 of 45 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","34","45","2","4"

The level design will usually place you in really tense situations where you'll most likely die and learn from your mistakes. In fact, most of the progression in the game will come from you, learning of the enemy and their placement, along with a few, really handy perks that will allow you to have ghosts like minions or better dodging (which is crucial if you want to survive).\nThough leveling your character can feel a bit weird and even frustrating early on, for you really don't know what to upgrade at first. Most of the weapons dps or efficiency will be based on skills relative to specific weapons types, which makes you really hesitant in what to specialise because the game doesn't really give you clue of what will be best at use. For example i started by really focusing on spears and some mobility until i realised that most boss fights were better handled with long or great swords. Also i felt like the bow was really unworthy other than in locations that you already known, unless you spam randomly at the distance hoping to hit something that won't punish you after that.\nBut in overall the game feels decently balanced. Weapons brings their own playstyle, some being safer than others.\n\nThe game have some good ideas too, especially the ghosts followers and the way it tackles story and quests. Loved the pacing and attention to details, from the light radius effect tied to your torch to the small foot prints displaying where you already go and stuff like that.\nBut to be fair, what really makes the game is the atmosphere, which is gorgeous ! It's dark, mysterious and have moments of thrill that will make you shiver and progress with caution. I especially love how you go from an underdark cave that feel claustrophobic to a suddenly wide plain with a strong breeze. Makes you really paranoid to what you might encounter from any direction.\n\nMy only few complaints would be that, well i found myself getting disoriented quite often and had to rely heavily on the in-game map due to the art-style of the game. I mean, i don't blame the artistic direction that i find really good, to be honnest. Just that even if there's attention to details that helps bring some personnality to a few places, the black and white look get a bit unclear at some points.\nThe Maniability can be really abrupt sometimes too, stuff like dodges or attacks that doesn't always work in close combat even with a good stamina on, or even occurs twices when you didn't meant to. It usually happens when launching an attack, while the character was preparing to swing, if you happen to hit the trigger again.\nAlso i admit that sometimes i just killed my character so i could proc the two ghosts follower to make the playthrough a little easier, for there's some really unfair moments here and there. It's also sad that the huge amount of campfire feels a bit like a way to compensate the low amount of healing items, and that using inventory in combat is just impossible.\n\nLastly, there's a lot of details that will look like a Darksouls copy paste. Which i don't really complain since i like that game a lot. But still, you got bonfire and pyromancie and undeads and the UI and buttons placement... i can't help but feel a bit sad that it reproduces a concept without really improving on it or go a little ahead.\nI always felt that most of the souls serie gameplay mecanic were strongly tied to the lore of the game, from pyromancie being an art of using the flame within mankind and getting more powerful by feeding it or, the fact that you loose souls when you die because there's a thematic of going hollow and stuff like that. Dark Maus doesn't really seem to think or get that deep into that, even if the gameplay works fine.\n\nAlso the music, while being well composed, can be a bit off sometimes.\n\nBesides, i really enjoy the game and will probably play it through NG+, just so i can see how the game react if i kill everyone (especially Anna, for she really kicker my ♥♥♥ in my first try because i friendly fired her a little too much >.<).\nIt's pretty good, and since i always felt that there was too little RPGs with mices (being a fan of Mouse guard, Mice and mystics and Redwall) i'm just more than happy to have sweet title like these coming into the market place, and will gladly recommend it.","January 29","true","12.4"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freedomtacossss/recommended/406130/","freedomtacossss","Freedomtacos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freedomtacossss/","1020 products in account","The original review can be seen at   RogueReviews	[theroguereviews.com] with images, gifs and captions.\n\nTL;DR\nDarkmaus is a heavily inspired tribute to Dark Souls, play as a mouse as he journeys through the scourge of Hazarth in this fantastic little action RPG.\n\nPros\n+weighty combat\n+smart AI\n+good soundtrack\n+unique aesthetic\n+mice eat cheese to heal\n\nCons\n– NG+ balancing could use work\n\nDarkMaus is the first entry of hopefully many games for indie developer Daniel Wright. It is no secret that DarkMaus is heavily inspired by Dark Souls, with the developer openly talking about his love for the series itself and how there was nothing quite like its combat which led to him making DarkMaus. While DarkMaus is clearly inspired by it, it has developed an identity of it’s own with it’s minimalistic artstyle and 2D top down combat. You find yourself adrift on a shoreline with a broken raft nearby, dialogue prompts show up along the way explaining the mechanics of the game.\n\nIf you’re a Dark Souls player like I am, most of the mechanics will feel very familiar. If you’re not acquainted with the series then there are a couple key points you should know before diving in. DarkMaus has slow, weighty combat, it rewards patience and well planned combat initiations. You cannot button mash or rashly run through a mob of enemies, they will punish you thoroughly and make quick work of you. Healing items come in the form of cheese and are especially scarce so you cannot waste them on the simplest of battles. You want to avoid death at all costs, the reason being is that you lose all your bone marrow upon death. Bone Marrow is used at bonfires which are basically check points that save your progress and allow you to recover all your health and upgrade your stats. DarkMaus is an RPG at it’s core, and while you could finish the game at level 1 with enough skill and patience, levelling up is usually the recommended route for newbies.\n\nYou have a level up menu that shows all your weapon skills and attributes. Health affects how much damage you can take, Stamina determines how many attacks or dodges you can do before getting tired, Capacity reduces movement penalty on heavy armour, resilience affects how easily you get stunlocked by attacks and Dexterity affects attack speed. You gain 1 point per level to put in any of those, the only downside is that it requires more bone marrow from enemies the higher the level you are.\n\nEach weapon type has their own moveset, and damage types. You can specialize in many different types of weapons but it’s usually best to specialize in 1 or 2 weapons that cover your weaknesses. There are clones of yourself that you find scattered around the world who have your exact loadout so it’s doubly important to cover your own bases and have a backup weapon that can counter your moveset. All weapons have a minimum spec requirement in their respected skill type with most basic weapons having an average requirement of 2 points, giving you an opportunity to try out most of the weapons and see which playstyle you’re most comfortable with. On my first run I championed a Katana and shield which allowed for a very agile moveset, where I mainly concentrated on flowing in and out of battle with short quick attacks which gave me ample time to dodge out of harm’s way at any given moment.\n\nLike the Souls games, it tends to rely on showing rather than telling. It relies on visual storytelling rather than narrative, allowing the player to interpret what has happened and decide what you should do about it. There are rare moments when you will come across other sane mice in DarkMaus, most of them friendly in nature. If you decide to help them, only then will you learn what exactly is happening in the world of Hazath. An ancient Necromancer named Zarristar has returned, his army of hunters prey on the living, feeding on them for power so in turn he can feed on them and regain the power he has once lost. His constant revival of his enemies for feeding has caused them to go feral, becoming the vicious monsters they are now. Lord Victor went to face Zarristar before the scourge occurred but he has yet to return…Your task, if you choose to accept, is to find him and creating a plan to break Zarristar’s curse once and for all. The beauty of DarkMaus is that you don’t have to play nice, you can kill everyone and the game will play along. It’s up to you whether or not you want to restore peace to the world or become a vessel of Zarristar himself.\n\nDarkMaus has a beautiful, dark minimalist art style that perfectly embodies the cruel reality of the world you’re exploring. The world surrounding you is bleak, covered in shadows. You can barely see anything past the light of your torch which slowly diminishes the longer you go without finding a bonfire. Every step into the unknown is filled with uncertainty and dread, knowing that your next step could lead to your inevitable demise. You will die, a lot. Levels are filled with all sorts of traps, that will corner you and force you to fight enemies while heavily disadvantaged. Darkmaus introduces a mechanic called Death Echoes to overcome these odds, if you find these trinkets everytime you die, a little ghost ally will follow you around and fight with you for a fraction of your strength. Find enough trinkets and die enough in a specific area and you’ll be roaming around with your own little mouse army. If you’re a roguelike fan, death and repeated frustration is probably your idea of a great time, otherwise stay far, far away.\n\nThe soundtrack supplements the atmosphere of the game with slow moving synth pieces, that are ambient and droning, shifting in nature giving the player subtle clues of what’s to come next. This is most apparent when the music becomes clashing and cataclysmic, with only one message warning you “You are Being Hunted.” Every once in a while, you will be invaded by Hunters whose soul purpose is to kill you and feed on your corpse for your bone marrow. The hunters are fast, they are fierce and they are merciless. If you get caught by a hunter while in the middle of clearing other enemies, chances are you will not survive. Your best course of attack is to run far, far way until you can fight him solo and even then it’s still quite the challenge. If you lose and they feed on you, you will respawn with only half your health which slowly goes back to normal over time, while victory rewards you with a massive amount of experience.\n\nMy biggest critique of DarkMaus if I were to choose would be the balancing of NG+ and beyond. The combat went from unforgiving to absolutely brutal in the later sections. I believe this is due to the randomized curse you are given which can range from, harder to stun opponents to your dead corpses are reanimated and become enemies. I received the latter curse and I absolutely dreaded the thought of dying at any moment due to how strong my build was, making it impossibly hard to face not only myself in combat but avoiding other enemies and traps at the same time as well. Other than that, I have very few minor qualms about DarkMaus except possibly adding a strafe mode outside of combat to avoid traps adeptly.\n\nDarkmaus is a rare gem that captivated me for hours on end, only breaking the spell once I actually finished the game in a single 6+ hour session. And once I did, the very next day I went straight back to marathoning it until completion in NG+ mode. It’s that good. DarkMaus emulates and captures the atmosphere and gameplay that I loved so much from Dark Souls 1, bringing it's own well done minimalistic approach with adorable mice characters that can go feral at the drop of a hat. I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who wants to scratch that Souls itch or to new players who want a unique experience of patient and rewarding combat that will keep you enthralled for days to come.","February 13","true","11.4"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","17","18","2","0"

It has plenty of things that make it unique, however, such as the Death Echo and ability systems, the fighting style, and the art.\n\nPros:\n-Fighting is fun and varies greatly from enemy to enemy\n-The Ai is intelligent for what it is, and forces players to try different items and strategies. I often found that the harder enemies were more sneaky and skilled than I was, and had to return later when I'd gotten better.\n-Level design and enemy placement is very well done, and captures the feeling of relief/surprise when finding a shortcut in the original Dark souls. There are also some enemies that, when defeaten, change the dungeon in some way, which is neat.\n-When the player is killed, they are ressurected along with a "Death Echo", a ghost of your former self that retraces its steps and battles enemies along the way. It's a nice way of making sure players don't get stuck in hard areas, as you can make sure your ghost hoard is carrying the weapons that will benefit you the most (by dying while wielding them) and power through tough spots.\n-The dev (yep, singular) is very helpful and dedicated to his game, and is trying to work out any problems players report\n\nCons\n-It's a bit rough around the edges. Music will cut out and restart randomly, there's no real title screen,  and there are a number of bugs (most of them harmless, but some frustrating) that I've run into. After the most recent patch there have been a fair bit of crashes as well, although I feel that those will be solved relatively quickly.\n-The game seems pretty heavy on CPU usage and could use some optimisation.\n\nOverall, it's a challenging, fun game that's experiencing the few hiccups that follow any game release. I wholeheartedly recommend it, but if you don't want to deal with these early bugs I'd put it on your wishlist and check back in a few weeks.","January 28","true","9.6"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

In under 10 hours.  I beat dark souls three times.\nWelcome to DeadMaus!\n\nThe biggest difference between this game and dark souls is the ability to not die!  There are five primary reasons as to why you will die in deadmau5:\n\n- no estus flasks; you'll find items that heal you but they are all consumed\n- the vision is limited not only by your screen, but you can't see anything that's not lit up by a light source; this game is dark in a very literal sense of the word\n- Traps.  Are.  Everywhere.\n- 90% of the time, you will not see the traps (that.  are.  everywhere.) until you spring them\n- the enemy AI's are evil geniuses operating under the evil power of the evil Mother Brain evil evil\n\nAnd yet, after all all of this death, I still recommended this game!  Dark Maus is not fun because it directly mimics the Dark Souls games, but because it flawlessly emulates I Wanna Be The Guy via great use of the mechanics of the Souls series.  In consequence of using Souls's mechanics, the game offers plenty of replay value through its weapon variety, self-handicaps and how you take care of baddies.  And, because it's like IWBTG, you get to die a lot in a lot of hilariously unfair ways.  This game's a very odd kind of blast, but a blast nonetheless.\n\nIts only real shortcomings are its lack of story and its fairly plain (albeit spoopy) sound track.  But this game costs $10 and was made by one guy, so there's that.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to anyone looking to jump right into a challenging game for cheap, so long as they don't mind leaving behind their MLG KDR.\n\n8/10.

The theme of desperation and futility is very apparent. Unlike Dark Souls, this game presents itself in a shaded black and tan art-style that works very nicely with the light mechanics.\n\nThis game is hard, or at least it was for me. Enemies are far more agressive than the hollows of Dark Souls. They'll attempt to swarm you, they'll charge you when you're at your weakest. For example, an early enemy you encounter will dodge back out of your sword swings, then attempt to get behind you in a swarm. Some enemies will charge you if you attempt to turn tail and run away. Because of this, you are forced to play either very defensively OR hyperaggressively with shock-and-awe tactics.\n\nThe game gives you a varitey of weapons, including spears, swords, bows, and pyromancy, though, some of them feel like direct upgrades of each other. This is a bit weird, considering DarkMaus has a weapon upgrading system where you invest resources you find in the enviroment to increase your weapon's stats. This can lead you to feel a bit cheated. Depsite this, most weapons have something they excel at, so as long as you like the mechanics of the weapon, it should be viable till the end.\n\nLight seems to have a bit of usefulness in DarkMaus. It isn't very apparent at first, but your torch has a lifespan and must be replenished at a campfire. Light reveals enemies farther away from your character, and I believe it also shows the stamina and health of the enemy (I might be mistaken). When the torch burns out, you won't be able to see enemies until you got close enough to aggro them. The light mechanic doesn't seem to be too much of an issue, as I rarely had a torch burn out on me.\n\nThe biggest departure from Dark Souls is it's ghost mechanics. In racing games, a ghost is a copy of yourself that appears when you finish a lap. It is common in racing games to compete against your ghost, as it is a visual representation of your time on the track.\n\nIn DarkMaus, after you aquire a certain item, you gain the ability to spawn ghosts. When you die, you respawn with a friendly ghost(s) who will aid you in your battles. I believe the ghosts have a mind of their own and will attempt to relive your death, meaning they will charge at the enemies that slayed you previously. I might be misinturpreting their actions; however, there are additional abilites that make the ghosts follow you more closely with additional health. I found myself with an entourage of mouse ghosts during the more difficult sections. Unfortunatly, these ghosts can not follow you into boss arenas.\n\nAt times, you will also have an NPC with you. Their usefulness is questionable. They require a scarce healing item if they become wounded, and they are very suseptible to friendly fire. Their biggest benifit is that they can enter boss arenas, and there is some cool stuff with the story, but I won't get into that.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this game. It took me about seven hours to beat it once, and there is a New Game Plus that has harder enemies and a few new weapons.\n\nI recommend this game to Dark Souls fans. It also has cute mice in it.","April 26","true","7.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Before you read, please know I am a veteran Souls player. I've spent, literally, thousands of hours in these games, collectively. Also know, that I don't see any of those four titles as perfect. Each one has some pretty strong weaknesses, but generally these are overlooked because the games are so well crafted. I strongly urge everyone AGAINST using this in reference to, or as part of the Souls series style of games. This game differs heavily and it's most prominent features make it more akin to a horror game with action/rpg elements.\n\nDark Maus left a very sour taste in my mouth. The game started out great. A simple, yet elegant aesthetic, relatively tight gameplay, and it seemingly functioned well. I guess it was all there right? Absolutely not. The first few hours of this game are a sickening ruse.\n\nIn my opinion, this game embodies what an outside perspective of all Souls titles is; no story, extraordinarily brutal gameplay, and absolutely no explanation of anything. These are the negative tropes that really drive people away, and yet they account for most of the game.\n\nTowards the end, the game's progression started scaling a wall and never stopped. Dark Maus went from reasonable to insane over the course of one level and never dropped difficulty. Packs of enemies fill rooms, TRAPS EVERYWHERE, tight spaces and terrifyingly aggressive, intelligent enemies. The second half of the game is a veritable gauntlet until the very last boss. The way these were combined made the game feel needlessly difficult. My only drive to finish was that I wouldn't let a cheap imitation beat me.\n\nDark Maus feels like someone glossed over a list of items to cook a dish with, crossed off one line, and added a few odds and ends that were thought to liven up a dish;\n\nYou. Can't. Do. That.\n\nThere's a reason why Souls games work. Specifically because there are so many titles on that list and have only improved because of the design progression. For the most part, every subsequent title was an improvement in a core area of the game (I have slight hang-ups with saying that about Dark Souls 2. However, the DLC and SOTFS redeemed the game, albeit at the cost of almost two and a half games worth of purchases and another year's wait to get a functioning product, but I digress).\n\n^ ***To counter my above statement, in favor of the lone developer of Dark Maus, it is just one dude working here, I believe. Not a whole studio. So, he deserves some credit for making a pretty functional game solo, even if it did rehash most of it's substance from another game series.***\n\nSurely, you must be wondering how a game tanks so shortly into it's livelyhood. To give an abreviated list:\n\n-A lack of ways to counter obstacles (I.E. No backstabs or parries. Staggering is wonky and unpredictable outside exploits.)\n-A learning curve that evolves into a 90 degree angle at the drop of a dime\n-A poor iteration of existing mechanics from Souls games\n-What I can only assume to be less than thought out enemy progression/level design\n-Literally, no lore\n-An even worse direction than people perceive of Souls games\n-Generic and unrewarding boss style encounters (Only one boss was difficult. Artificially at that.)\n\nBut it does things differently, and different isn't always bad, right? Perhaps some of the new iterations are positive? So, as an homage that chose to be brave and stray from the fundamental design, how does it differ? Well;\n\n-No on-demand healing. That's right. There is no one button command for healing. As far as I can tell, this was a purposeful feature. Dark Maus' lack of reliable healing was set in place to really instill dread in the heart of the player in combination with another mechanic I'll address shortly. This made each camp fire feel miles apart; contributing to a rather soul-crushing journey. Now, this would be great if tuned PROPERLY, as this became ferociously annoying. Dark Maus felt as though an estus flask system was intended and I believe would have enriched the game; creating a much more fair environment for new and veteran players alike.\n\n^ ***To amend the above, there are actually healing items in the game. However, they are VERY few and far between and only usable from the inventory menu which you cannot physically move while inside of. Also, the menus are a pain in the ♥♥♥ to navigate quickly, as they feel very flimsy and disorganized.***\n\n-Dark Maus features a semi-unique torch system. This torch provides light in the darker, and most dangerous, areas of the game. It functions on a timer; really reinforcing that dread, as you never know where the next fire to refresh your light, health, and spells will be. This is actually the strongest feature of the game. Souls could never pry that terror out of me. Dark Maus is ♥♥♥♥ing scary.\n\n-The Abilities system. Entertaining at first, grown stale by the end. Sadly, most of these are rendered useless. Only a few really matter and you get enough points to use all of them by the end. So, really they're kind of arbitrary. Honestly, these should have been trimmed down to a smaller list and incorporated as part of the base game design, rather than locking them away and saving them for later. For example: your standard dodge/dash action, which is your best buffer versus damage, has ZERO invincibility frames, as opposed to the natural I-frames given to you in Souls games. While this is quickly remedied through the abilities function, this shouldn't even be considered in the formula, especially when the entirety of the game is a more claustrophobic and hazardous version of another game that's already considered very challenging; favoring my above statement of the abilities being a poor system.\n\n-The world as a whole wants you to die. Seriously, Daniel, who hurt you, dude? I jest, but I've never felt more singled out and targeted before. The land will surround and wash over you with waves of unforgiving natives of a feral mindset. There is no reason, only death. So, this sounds a lot like Dark Souls, right? Wrong. The core difference is that the Souls games are designed with perception in mind. The top down style in combination with the torch system doesn't bode well for being alert to dangers. Most of my early game deaths were because I couldn't appropriately account for what was out of my vision. The game punishes you just for existing, where as Souls only punishes you for mistakes. The Souls series shows you everything, and allows you to react to it. That's a world of a difference.\n\n^ ***It should be noted that this is more of a design limitation. I could not expect the same level of detail from Dark Maus. However, it does show how taking 3/4 of a forumla and swapping it in where it might not belong inhibits a game.***\n\nSo, there lie the key differences. Overall, not terrible iterations. In fact, this game could have been truly unique if Daniel had more time to polish it. Personally, I'm overjoyed to see large studios and indie developers alike take a crack at the Souls formula. It means I get to play more of these awesome games that I love. Especially, filling that void after Bloodborne: The Old Hunters and before Dark Souls 3.\n\n***TL;DR/FINAL VERDICT***\n\n6/10\n\nDark Maus was a decent attempt at recreating the Souls style gameplay. However, ultimately it failed, in my eyes, due to being too quick to change certain things in the formula. I would only recommend this game to those who are truly curious and content to get a cheap Souls thrill. I don't recommend this game to anyone who hasn't been exposed to the Souls genre, because there is very little chance you'll reap any enjoyment out of this.\n\n","February 4","false","15.6"," 78 of 139 people (56%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","56","78","139","8","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KoboldCoterie/recommended/406130/","KoboldCoterie","Kobold Foreign Relations Bureau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KoboldCoterie/","1187 products in account","DarkMaus unappologetically tries to emulate the Dark Souls series in a top-down format. It doesn't even try to hide the fact that it's a blatant ripoff of the style and genre, and frankly, that's perfectly okay with me, because the game is a lot of fun.\n\nIf you've played Dark Souls (and if you haven't, stop reading this and go do so, then come back when you're done and keep reading), you'll be immediately familiar with the formula - you have a stamina and health pool, a light and heavy attack, you can sprint, dodge and block, and all of these consume stamina. Run out of stamina, and you're stuck waiting for it to regenerate. Combat is largely based around timing your blocks, dodges and attacks to avoid attacks while getting your own hits in. Killing enemies often earns you Souls - uh, sorry, 'Marrow', which can also be found occasionally on corpses pre-populating the world. Dying causes you to drop your marrow where you died. You can return to the spot to reclaim your lost Marrow, but if you die again before you do, it's gone forever. You rest at bonfires - excuse me, 'campfires', which heals you and lets you spend your Marrow to level up, but also respawns all non-boss enemies in the world. There's a variety of weapon options, each of which have different advantages and disadvantages as well as differing attack patterns, in addition to being able to learn magic in the form of pyromancy.\n\nSound familiar? It should.\n\nOne difference really stood out, though - you have weapon skills that you must invest levels into to use weapons of that type. While this isn't a problem per se, it forces you to choose a weapon type and specialize in it, rather than being able to try out each new weapon you find as you can in the Souls series. I found some interesting looking weapons later in the playthrough that I would have liked to try, but investing 10+ levels into a skill only to potentially find out that I didn't like the weapon was not something I was willing to do. (To illustrate how much 10 levels is, I finished the game at level 68.) Further, weapons can be upgraded using a limited availability upgrade material (similar to Dark Souls), but each new weapon in a weapon class is more or less an upgrade over the previous one, so I felt compelled to wait until I had all of the weapons in my chosen weapon type before starting to upgrade anything, because I didn't want to waste the materials on a "sub-par" option. As such, even though the upgrades became available early in the game, I wasn't able to really leverage it until more than half way through, so it felt like a bit of a wasted mechanic, on me, at least. Your mileage may vary depending on your playstyle.\n\nThe combat is very tight, and the controls feel responsive. Some aspects of movement, though, take a little getting used to - for example, you can't turn in place easily. This is the product of the game having only a single control for movement (the left stick on the controller you should be using to play this), which controls both facing and movement. The right stick is used for locking onto enemies (though if there are no enemies around, it can be used to adjust facing, as well). This makes negotiating some environmental hazards a bit frustrating, particularly if you're forced to do so quickly, and you'll likely endure a number of frustratingly "unfair" deaths because of this.\n\nOne particularly trap-filled area was frustrating me endlessly, and I was prepared to come and complain about it in this review, but then after banging my head against it for some time, I realized that there are a number of alternate paths to take through the area (apart from the 'direct' route), and that completing these alternate paths would in turn make the 'direct route' more manageable. Upon discovering this, the area became much more fun, and despite the initial frustration, I'm inclined to applaud the designer for this particular facet of the game. In Dark Souls style, it rewards exploration, which I love.\n\nThe bosses weren't as difficult as I would have liked - nor are they too numerous. Most are easily defeatable in 1 or 2 tries (the first time to see the attack patterns, the second time to win the fight if you didn't on the first try), and even the final encounter is very strait-forward once you identify the gimmick and realize how to deal with it, but that isn't much of a detractor - the game itself is delightfully difficult at times.\n\nThe music is simple but fits well, and the art aesthetic works very well.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend this game for fans of top-down action games, or fans of Dark Souls. It's not too long (5ish hours for my first playthrough; I expect a NG+ playthrough would be closer to 2 hours, though I've yet to attempt this), but for a $10 game, that's good value for the money, in my opinion.","January 31","true","9.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/indecentfellow/recommended/406130/","indecentfellow","Anubis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/indecentfellow/","209 products in account","A Dark Souls inspired top-down action RPG.\nSimple yet solid and enjoyable combat system which takes a while to get good at. It is complemented by a nice weapon selection; Dexterity weapons, including high attack speed and low damage swords and spears; Strength weapons with heavier swords and twohanders; and Precison weapons with bows and pyromancies.\nWhile fairly basic, they are well implemented and every weapon is unique enough to be interesting, and each weapon type offers its own fighting style. While there is a decent amount of choice, a few more weapons probably wouldn't have hurt.\n\nThe areas are pretty varied both in theme and in gameplay, and are all open to exploration, with little nooks and crannies containing goodies that never disapoint. The encounters are all intersting, fun, and creative. Some are fairly frustrating with some types of builds, tho. (Mostly thinking of having to go through an archer heavy area with a two hander focused build that can't block arrows. Pretty painful.)\nThe bosses are a mixed bag. 4 are just normal enemies, but bigger or in greater number. They are still enjoyable, but kinda disapointing. Of the 2 original ones I fought (I read somewhere that I skipped one), one just felt like a non stop barrage of attacks that seemed to start and stop at random. The other one, which was the final boss, was pretty good however.\n\nThe game itself is pretty short. I finished it in 6 hours, but I did skip an area, but I did pretty much all of the other optional stuff and explored the areas fully. It's kinda redeemed by a NG+ mode with exclusive weapons and modified encounters, but it doesn't negate the fact that I finished the game still wanting more of it.\n\nThe art style is well used and implemented, and manages to give a good deal of detail and serve the gameplay with a good use of shadows and line of sights, while still remaining simple.\nThe narrative is pretty simple and cliché, but the story that unfolds still has its little moments.\n\nOverall, it's pretty good. An enjoyable and challenging, if short experience well worth its price. And who knows, maybe there is gonna be more content to come in the future.\n","February 20","true","7.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It really gives you a good sense that the world is in despair and chaos.\n\nThis is a game that rewards you for skillfully mastering the level.  You cannot simply bulldoze your enemies or just walk through levels hoping for the best.\n\nThe enemies have their own strengths and weaknesses for you to figure out and you must use the best weapon or combo against them.  For example I was able to beat a certain creature by only using a curved blade for its fast attacks and moving around in a circle close to the body of an enemy to avoid their attacks.\n\nWhich brings me to my next positive point that all battles are interesting and different outcomes can and will happen even if you have to do it over again and again.\n\nThis game was inspired by dark souls and was well designed to test you at every step of the way.\n\n\nNegatives:\n\nThis game was inspired by dark souls and so get ready for a frustrating difficult ride.  I list this on the positive and negative side because it is worth noting that if you like a real challenge than this game is for you. If you like fun casual games steer very far and clear away from this game.\n\nThe controls are slightly difficult at first to get used to even if you use an xbox controller (which it was designed for).  I wish there was a way to map what you want for yourself or have more default configurations to choose from.\n\nSince you will die a lot, the story is difficult to get into.  After 10 hours of play, the only thing I understand is to save (I forget what the mouse's name)'s father from somewhere (I forget where because He wasn't in the prison and it took me hours to get through that part).\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8LD-q6k0x5w\n\nTLDR:  Get ready to work for it.

But this is quite a different experience that goes beyond it being top-down 2D. The game plays out in much shorter bursts. Rather than having relatively wide open areas and lots of ground to cover between enemies and bonfires, DarkMaus has incredibly small, but well detailed areas with a handful of enemies and well placed environment set pieces, that challenge the player into making every single move correct. The combat is the same risk/reward style as in Dark Souls, with each enemy given neat little traits that make them all different.\n\nMy main gripe is pretty obvious - the lack of deeper characterization and RPG mechanics. Leveling up is quite shallow and rather linear, with only a handful of each weapon types. You don't really 'build' much of a character outside of a couple of obvious choices, and given the length of the game that's obvious why.\n\nOtherwise, this is such a neat game to pick up while waiting for Salt and Sanctuary to one day finally get a release date.","January 30","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Broadly speaking, should you play this game? Yes, yes you should. Even if you're someone who's not interested in Dark Souls and its ilk, this is an amazing top down 2d rpg, well worth the asking price.\n\nIt's bleak and dark aesthetics suit well with the atmosphere its developer tried to create. You're instantly put into a strange world with realistic rules. It's free flowing tutorial allows a new player to easily flow into the gameplay, while challenging them. Even as a Dark Souls veteran (Over a thousand hours of gaming in the games respectively.) I felt that there was challenge, fair challenge.\n\nThe map allows and encourages exploration at the risk of losing your EXP (Marrow), with interesting enemies all teaching you something new in how you should approach combat. Even if you start hitting a wall of difficulty, the ghost mechanic, whereby you get the aid of a ghost NPC that lowers the difficulty by attacking the enemies, something that is entirely optional and modifiable if you so choose to use this mechanic to aid you, allowing great difficulty tweaking for the player themselves. Something that even Dark Souls would be proud of.\n\nThe characters you meet along the way exploring this desolate world are engaging, I cannot tell you much more without spoiling, so you'd have to experience it for yourself.\n\nThere are some areas where you're left wanting however. Take for example the clumsy inventory, which can make it somewhat uncomfortable to traverse. Another one of these places is the sound design, while the game is very minimalistic in its color and assets, which helps the mood of the game, there are some areas where the lack of background noise makes it seem much too quiet and not in an eerie sense. At least, that is my subjective viewpoint of the sound design.\n\n+ Deep combat mechanics\n+ Welcoming to veterans and new players alike\n+ Branching weapon/skill/custimization early on\n+ Exploration is rewarded\n+ Interesting NPC's\n+ Ease of entry\n+ Fair Challenge\n\n- Clumsy Inventory\n-/+ Minimalist Sound Design\n\n9/10","January 30","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not impossible to play without it but it's a much better experience. Secondly: if you normally rage and break tables while playing Dark Souls or Bloodborn, keep all the tables away while playing DarkMaus, play on the floor.\n\nDarkMaus takes inspiration from skill based hard games so expect to die a lot. You will have to perfect your moves until you're ready to move to the next step. Although simple, there's a lot of depth into your character, you're able to choose how you want to play: as a warrior styled gameplay, magic user, archer, etc. I love the ghost twist, the game doesn't become downright easier if you keep failing but it will gradually help you with the ghost feature.\n\nIf you wish to see it in action you're more than welcome to check this video, it's a First Look into the game:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-tIuEabgRU&list=PLBqXrq67D6ooHk9drYSFDxURYRMCCUc-v&index=1","January 26","true","1.3"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

It brilliantly uses high, sharp contrast with light and dark (think top-down Limbo) and a limited field of vision to set a great mood and give combat a bit of panache as it helps hide enemies which leads to exciting surprise attacks.\n\nWhat at face value looked like a simple game of generic hack n' slash dodge/block/stab is a fairly complex and engaging system of meaningful stats and inventory building.  There are a variety of fire magic attacks and weapons to use with different damage ratings, ranges and attack speeds to help you survive.\n\nYou won't survive but that's neither here nor there. I found that once I realized death was a part of the game I had a LOT more fun with that knowledge.  When you die a ghost(s) will spawn and fight along side you and help you get back to your body to re-collect your marrow. Marrow is the currency you need to level skills and is vital.\n\nCombat is intense. Whether fighting one foe or 40 baby spiders every battle is life & death and you have to be very focused and deliberate to win.  Quick/strong attacks, blocking, backing off to regain stamina is like a compelling dance and really gets me into the combat in a unique way.\n\nThe story is spread out sparsely and the one NPC I found to fight with me and share some of the in-game history ended up aggroing me HARD when they kept getting in my way when fighting and getting spanked. This was irreconcilable. I felt crappy and will have to restart my game but it was a tough lesson to learn.\n\nThe campfire system is interesting and I did have issues with it.  When you use a campfire you safe, get your health back, and level skills. Also every enemy you've faced respawns.  This is good as you can grind a bit without dying but you end up having to face the same group of mobs and it gets a little repetitive and annoying.  You want to get through without damage to get farther the next run, and that can be easier said than done.\n\nDarkMaus is a game that I hope does very well as it really surprised me and I think it'll surprised other gamers, too. Plus, combat mouse. Come on. That's friggin' awesome. :3\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a copy of DarkMaus for review purposes.

Im a veteran of the Dark Souls games, do not let the reviews claming this is just like the DS series fool you.  It is like them on a conceptual level, but the gameplay and scaling of the game is a complete disaster.  What separates DS from this game is that in DS, the designers have a lot more respect for the player and their skill.\n\n"A worthy challenge - combat in DarkMaus is thoughtful and skill based"\n\nThis game is full of unblockable and undodgable attacks and traps that are just borderline cheap and tedious.  There is little explanation on how some of the basic game mechanics work, and everything is just so damn cheap in this game.  It's artificial difficulty made by what looks like some sort of try-hard level designer.  I know real difficulty and challenge, and I embrace it.  This game is just full of really poorly designed stages loaded with things that knock out pretty much all of your HP regardless of your armor or if you block.  A bunch of crap will hit you with fire damage that goes through your shield and one shots you, that's OK..I'll buff my fire resiastance...of wait, there is no Fire resistance stat!  Good design there kiddo!\n\n\nThe game is just full of little things like this that when compounded amount to just artificial difficulty.   The first hour or so is fine, but suddenly you walk into a certain area and the difficulty just spikes 700% because of this sort of idiotic level design.  Dark Souls was hard, but fair.

Combat is weighty and sluggish in all the wrong ways, enemy placement seems to have little to no thought put into it, enemy attack patterns are relentless and rarely allow for an opening to counter attack, environments seem to be designed to cause unavoidable damage and healing items are incredibly sparse.\n\nI am going to attempt to get a refund for the friend who purchased this for me, but it is unlikely that I will be able to because of a bug where the game wouldn't close, pushing my play time over 2 hours.\n\nAvoid.","February 10","false","3.6"," 9 of 28 people (32%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","32","9","28","4","0"

If you like dark souls, you'll like this, although it isn't as good, it is pretty cheap.  Except, there's one huge problem.  It's not fair.  Dark Souls is said to be tough but fair, and for the most part it is.  This game is just tough.  Really tough.  Maybe I invested in the wrong stats, I don't know, it's not like the game provides guidance at all.  Now, early on I find some spiders, and there's no way for me to kill them without taking damgage, but there's no quick heal like estus, and the only heal is a consumable that I find myself constantly with 5 of, even though I use them sparingly.  If I used them when I needed them, I'd have about negative 30.  Continuing, I find more very hard enemies, take more damage from things I can't block, and even the basic enemies become very hard.  I finally reach the first boss, and he charges at me swinging a huge axe.  This axe drains my stamina with 2 swings, which he dishes out very quickly, so blocking isn't a possibility.  So I try dodging.  But the actual movement is slightly delayed from the press of the button, and the enemies attack so quickly with little warning, making this dodging very hard.  And that's about where I left off, dying to the boss like 10 times in a row and quitting.  I will come back, but I need some time to get away from this first.  I want a game to feel possible with any playstyle.  Also, I tried archery and it was terrible.  With no shield, you have to dodge literally everything, with countless enemies in many areas and low stamina, and then you get backed into corners without a shield.  So as much as I want this game to be good, and as good as the gameplay is, I can't recommend it, because it's too hard for all the wrong reasons.  I should be able to get more than one hit on literally the first boss within my first 10 tries, instead of dying instantly (because his first attack is a charge out of the darkness where he's in your sight for a second before hitting you.)","February 8","false","3.3"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","9","1","11","2","0"

It's just that I can see myself being more interested in this than I currently am and I hope that the developer takes it further, hopefully.\n\nI'm not one to enjoy using the term "souls-like" because of the endless abuse the term's received. People seem to relate any third-person RPG (or just any RPG) with Dark Souls because DARK SOULS DA BEST GAME EVER, ALL GAMES AR JUS BADER DARK SOULS. However, this game is quite honestly a major take from Dark Souls. It takes a similar approach to lore and a similar approach to gameplay.\n\nIt's very punishing. It starts off with no explanation, just "run around, hit things, get hit, die and kill," which must be quite frustrating for players not familiar with a Souls game. Inventory system is like Dark Souls and not Demon's Souls in that it only tracks the gear that is "equipped" as far as weight. Otherwise, you can carry five tons of gear. This gets really annoying as nothing is sorted really well. Inventory screen's a 3 block tall grid with about 5 or less blocks horizontal with little arrows you have to click to sort through. It's clunky to go through the inventory screen like this, and it's horrible if you've moved the bottom most part of the inventory screen rightwards and need a healing item, as the healing items are all the way leftwards. The game does not pause whilst managing the inventory, like the Souls games. You can, however, pause the game and get the typical "Unpause, Load, Settings, Exit" screen by pressing Escape.\n\nIt starts off fine enough with a handful of enemies that will hurt you and punish you if you don't play careful. Later, it becomes mired in overabundance of enemies more akin to DS2. Instead of giving you more reasonable challenge, it desires you to attempt to "pull" a single enemy's attention like the less-polished parts of Dark Souls and the general makeup of DS2.\nNow, reading that, I'd like to make a clear statement. I define two things when playing a game, or at least try to: There is difficulty, where you are presented with a challenge that you must struggle and learn to overcome by means of understanding the obstacle or enemy and proceeding with tact to surmount whatever is the challenge; Then there is tedium, where you are presented with an abundance of obstacles by various forms (i.e. overabundance of health in place of movesets and AI that require stratagem, overabundance of enemies in place of well-defined AI, etc. more in the way of quantity over quality) more often in a repetitive manner (i.e. fight one million annoying swarming enemies to get to the big bad and then get screwed up by him). I feel the game is rushed in the way of the end. In place of large, drawn out locations with traps and perhaps even puzzles, you are instead greeted with a ridiculous amount of aggressive enemies that seem to desire to make Shrine of Amana look like a kiddy pool Don't worry nothing is as bad as Shrine of Amana.\n\nThere's absolutely nil on the lore. Dark Souls gave you insight into the lore not just from cutscenes, but as through the character maker. Preset faces were common looks of people of different lands. Then of course were item descriptions which've become so infamous with the Souls series. This has next to nothing. Names are thrown around as well as places, but there's no substance or characterization worth nothing for to add character to any location or person. In Dark Souls, you could summise that people from Carim were shifty, keen, and ultimately mysterious from interactions with characters Lautrec and Oswald, and from description of the preset face in character creation. You have nothing here. This person is from here. That person did that. The game's world in the way of gameplay is already rather small and uncomfortable in its design (another note taken from Dark Souls 2's poor design?) to the point where this poor lore removes even more substance from the game.\n\nThere's very little in the way of content. Very few weapons in each category of Short Swords, Long Swords, Curved Swords, Greatswords, Pointy Sticks, Smashy Things, and Crispy-Critter-Cookers; very few pieces of armor; very few shields; very few accessories. Yes, $10 game, I know. I'm still going to complain because I spent money on it and I'm thinking you're thinking of doing the same. Don't expect to get much out of the game in the way of playtime. It's a shortened Dark Souls/Dark Souls 2 with budget cuts on everything.\n\nENEMY SPOILERS AHEAD\nGameplay's annoying half the time. Birds have a tendency to twirl around you violently instead of doing "dive bombs" you'd expect a bird to do. Bulls really hug onto you with their heads and their charges are anywhere from useless-stupid-flailing to ow-ow-ow. It's not fun to fight them, even though it's definitely not difficult to beat them. The varieties of rats are rather intelligent. They won't let you get away unless you absolutely exit their "leash" area. They block often and attack viciously as often. It's an active effort for the most part to fight them, at least in my time as a Spear and Shield user. Solid AI on the enemies, but this becomes frustrating as I've said earlier where enemies become numerous and globbed. It's not impossible to do, it's just not fun, at least for me.\n\nNow, the final boss has rubbed me the wrong way. I've yet to beat him, and I'm sure I will eventually, but I really dislike this kind of thing. The boss has a very simple moveset of "stand idle and get destroyed." This is aided by his ability to call in very aggressive and horrid creatures that have served as a verifiable nightmare through my playtime. Stamina consumption is so great I'm left breathless in between dodging the boss' attacks and the attacks of his little pets. I've discovered, however,  they can be attacked before he calls them forth, but they still are aggressive, you gain no damage increase you normally would hitting these things unawares, and they also attack amazingly quick as they get up if you hit them as they're sleeping.\n\nENEMY SPOILERS ENDED\nI'm really interested in seeing what the dev does in the future, as this game simply reeks of amateur design and lack of thorough polish which is easily resolved by constant effort and a desire to improve. I'm not expecting any changes to the game in any major way to cure my ills with it since it's not one of those horrid Early-Access titles, so I'm afraid I'll have to settle for negative on it. However, I hope the dev takes well the criticism and improves. My main problems stems from later level design, truly, where there stands tedium in place of challenge. Consider drawing out the map with a variety and combination of traps and enemies that require tact to get past in a way different from "juggle 3 giant rats that really don't like you at the same time".","February 6","false","5.3"," 8 of 27 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","8","27","0","0"

No idea.\n\n\nTL,DR:\nEntertaining but short-lived, slow-paced, harsh, top-down sword fighting  with the occasional dash of bullet hell. Wait for a sale or give it a spin if you're craving for a soulslike (because that's apparently a thing now).\n\n\nJust like in the Souls series, you must keep an eye on your stamina bar more so than your health, proceed carefully or else run into death around the corner, and there's a sense of achievement when you unlock one of the many shortcuts that make your life a whole lot easier.\n\nThe difference is obviously that this game is played from a top-down perspective, so arguably it's much easier to know when exactly you will hit the enemy with the tip of your weapon whilst avoiding theirs.\n\nAs for weapons, you have a good variety to choose from, but they're not all that different from one another due to the limitations of the game's 2D design. It's just a matter of reach, damage, and speed because there are like 3 different attacks in this game aside from the 2 unlockable moves that all weapons have access to. This is part of the reason why this game has less replay value than the Souls games. At least I didn't feel like replaying the game with a different build because the experience would have been mostly the same, unless I completely forgo archery and pyromancy.\n\nThat's another thing. There's quite a lot of cheese in this game, pun intended. You will frequently run into situations where you pop in and out of cover to fight archers because the entire room is filled with them so going the melee route is like a dice roll waiting to fail, or spam pyromancy at a horde of turtles because it ignores their shields. I can see how these situations can be immensely frustrating when you decided not to invest in archery and pyromancy. Is that a flaw? I would say so, yes. It's as if the player is punished for playing how they like to play. In the Souls series, diversifying is a choice driven by comfort, not necessity.\n\nSomething else that's uncomfortable are the controls. In the Souls series and in this game, spacing and timing are of utmost importance, so it's rather frustrating to see your little mouse do a heavy attack in a combo even though you could have sworn you tapped that button to perform a light attack or the other way round.\n\nSimilarly, the way you turn is clunky. Sometimes it feels as though you turned around and hit the enemy by sheer chance whereas other times you miss an attack that had no business missing, but such is the folly of keyboard + mouse controls in the Souls games it seems. The gamepad controls are hopefully more responsive, but I can't say because I've been playing Souls exclusively on keyboard because I'm crazy.\n\nAt least the torch mechanic is suspenseful. Dark Souls 2 promised truly dark areas that pretty much require a torch for traversal. Unfortunately, it didn't deliver and the torch ended up worthless. In this game, you're always carrying a torch. By that I mean you have a ring of light around yourself that gradually becomes smaller until you rest at a campfire. When you have already been somewhere, you can see objects and enemies in the dark. When it's your first time exploring though and your torch is in its weakest state, you struggle to decide whether to turn back or keep pushing forward because you feel like the next campfire is near.\n\nSo all in all, this game is not a Souls clone, instead it takes what's good about Souls and presents it in a nice 2D format, but can be annoying more so than genuinely challenging. I would personally wait for a sale because you will be done in 7 hours give or take, unless you're enthralled by the simplicity of the combat, so you just keep restarting or keep going into new game plus. For me, it was a mostly pleasant one-time experience, so at least I don't regret buying this game.","March 3","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't explain it in words, it's just that good. Simplistic color design which works well, I would recommend a controller as the control over the character is a bit weird and floaty without one.\n\nThe game is great, I can't emphasise that enough. It is brutal where it needs to be, and skill selection is important when it comes to leveling up.\n\nUPDATE: So I recently finished the game, I still stick to the fact that this is a very good game, some areas may be a bit uneasy, but other than that it is still good... But with that being said, there were a few things near the end which I really didn't like.\n1. The ending is instant, you are unable to go back and look around before deciding to go into NG+, unable to go back and talk to Anna to see what she has to say, or anything of the sort. What I do like about the ending is that it informs you of whether or not you received all items, giving you a reason to go into NG+.\n2. The bosses become easier down the line, and the final boss is a peice of cake mattering on how you approach him. The boss before the final was way harder, while the one before that is two of the same which you have faced before. Is this bad? Not entirely, just a bit dissapointing.\n\nOther than that, it's still great and I would recommend it. That, and the possibility of updates could add onto the base game in the future.\n\nUPDATE 2: A recent update has increased the difficulty of the bosses.","February 1","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's just a matter of reach, damage, and speed because there are like 3 different attacks in this game aside from the 2 unlockable moves that all weapons have access to.

In the Souls series and in this game, spacing and timing are of utmost importance, so it's rather frustrating to see your little mouse do a heavy attack in a combo even though you could have sworn you tapped that button to perform a light attack or the other way round.\n\nSimilarly, the way you turn is clunky. Sometimes it feels as though you turned around and hit the enemy by sheer chance whereas other times you miss an attack that had no business missing, but such is the folly of keyboard + mouse controls in the Souls games it seems. The gamepad controls are hopefully more responsive, but I can't say because I've been playing Souls exclusively on keyboard because I'm crazy.\n\nAt least the torch mechanic is suspenseful. Dark Souls 2 promised truly dark areas that pretty much require a torch for traversal. Unfortunately, it didn't deliver and the torch ended up worthless. In this game, you're always carrying a torch. By that I mean you have a ring of light around yourself that gradually becomes smaller until you rest at a campfire. When you have already been somewhere, you can see objects and enemies in the dark. When it's your first time exploring though and your torch is in its weakest state, you struggle to decide whether to turn back or keep pushing forward because you feel like the next campfire is near.\n\nSo all in all, this game is not a Souls clone, instead it takes what's good about Souls and presents it in a nice 2D format, but can be annoying more so than genuinely challenging. I would personally wait for a sale because you will be done in 7 hours give or take, unless you're enthralled by the simplicity of the combat, so you just keep restarting or keep going into new game plus. For me, it was a mostly pleasant one-time experience, so at least I don't regret buying this game.","March 3","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You never even get to see the mouse you were sent to rescue. Disappointing.\n-I accidentally killed children villager mice while trying to give them back their ball\n-If it was made slightly more divergent from Dark Souls, it would be a masterpiece in its own right. It was SO CLOSE. But in the end it resembled Dark Souls too much to feel more than a tribute. Both games are awesome, don't get me wrong; but I wish Dark Maus could've been more awesome in its own unique way.","March 23","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Anyone who's played Dark Souls should be familiar with the controls already. It has a really good presentation and a good challenge. Just like Dark Souls, you have to learn how to fight various enemies and what their weaknesses are, as well as how to dodge them.\n\nAlso, you get to play as a mouse! And all the characters are mice or animals of some sort. That makes this INSTANTLY awesome!","May 16","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The Ghosts fight just as you do and follow your most recent path and actions independantly unless you invest in abilities to have them join you as assistants.\nThe game uses "Marrow" instead of "Souls" to upgrade your character, though expect to lose them frequently so spend asap.\nThe Games Camera is prone to shifting as you enter new areas or rooms which can disorient the player or in my case actually make me nauseous once.\n\nThe game does carry one serious flaw ripped directly from Dark Souls and turned into nothing more than padding that nearly lead me to give it a negative review.\nHunters.  Yes, Hunters.  Evil Ghosts that hunt you down like red Phantoms eager to kill you and rob you instantly of everything you've worked for while also slicing your maximum hp in half for a minimum of 10-20 minutes.\nWhile the reward for killing one is a substantial increase in Marrow.  The sudden inconvenient appearance of these overpowered and crippling enemies that rob you of ALL your Marrow regardless of how you die including via other enemies gives the game artificial and inconveneint padding to extend playtime as you hobble around crippled waiting for your hp to return to its potential max.\nI wound up spending half the game walking around in circles praying I wouldn't be invaded by another random hunter before my HP returned so I could continue playing.\nWere this in some way optional or avoidable it would be of no concern to me, but it isn't.\n\nOverall a wonderful Game for those who enjoy challenge and masochistic level design with good gameplay dashed in for spice.\nFor its price it is a good game but do NOT buy this game if you seek a casual fun experience.   7/10","May 21","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Also there's a map. So DarkMaus is definitely very different from Salt and Sanctuary. And as far as appropriate thematic cues go, I'd say playing a mouse is very suited to the Souls series overarching metaphysics of meaningless struggle and inevitable despair. Perhaps even more than the original Souls games.\n\nSo before we watch the unfolding of the inevitable arms race of ever weaker creatures like flies, microscopic organisms and eventually subatomic particles as our protagonist, I'd like to end with this conclusion: DarkMaus is pretty good.","May 24","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
