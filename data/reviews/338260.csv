That's right, the whole game is 2 hours long... and not even a satisfying 2 hours. That even includes the boss glitching out twice, and me replaying it 3 ♥♥♥♥ing times, the one bonus level, and taking a break to feed my dog.... If you want to recreate the experience of this game for free, just hammer buttons on your controller randomly for two hours.\n\nI was really looking forward to this, and jumped on it because I love the comics. I wish I'd done more research beforehand.\n\nNot worth the price at all. Why did I finish this?","January 30, 2015","false","2.2"," 34 of 44 people (77%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","77","34","44","7","1"

Buy this game on your phone. Even as a big Yojimbo fan, I can’t in good faith tell people to buy the pc version of this mess. Everyone else? There are better ways to spend 4,99.","January 31, 2015","false","1.4"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

Recommended because I am one of those.  For the price it's not bad and you'll get your $5 worth. It reminds me of Fist of Jesus in terms of modern gameplay and quality of game.","January 30, 2015","true","0.2"," 27 of 53 people (51%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","51","27","53","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tenkaichi79/recommended/338260/","tenkaichi79","The Lord of Strategy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tenkaichi79/","344 products in account","Clearly this probably one of the most shortest games I ever played and is that a bad thing? Not really especially if I can do it in one sitting.  If you're a comic book lover, you'll like Usagi Yojimbo, or if you're into something really quick..you'll like it all the more. It has NO achievements so truly, it's nothing more than a score attack game with a good story following.  I'm hoping they do make a sequel with a bit more of a challenge since this game was good but could use a bit more of a challenge, combat wise at least. Considering how cheap this game, just try for yourself. You might like it..or not, but it worth something if you need a break from long games.","April 26, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Other characters from the Usagi Yojimbo series (such as Gennosuke and Inazuma) make cameo apperances in the game.\n\nUnfortunately, the gameplay is where this game falls flat on it's face. The game is simple hack and slash, and is far too easy. Depsite the fact that the are many different combos unlocked as the game goes on, there is no point in even using them when the whole game can be beat using the basic hack and slash moves that Usagi has at the start. There is simply no variety in the game other than kill all the baddies and move onto the next scene.\n\nIf you were ever and fan of the Commodore 64 game 'Samurai Warrior: The Adventures of Usagi Yojimbo' or even just a general Miyamoto Usagi fan, steer clear of this game and just go play the C64 classic intsead.","February 11","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
