The reason for this is that you need to "take the place" of your ship before it shoots, which, in a lateral kind of way, feels like hitting notes on a Guitar Hero guitar. Which was great fun!\n\nA fun, original concept, and a very enjoyable experience!\n\nNilesy","June 17, 2014","true","1.5"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","34","36","0","0"

As the cheeky Rick Rocket you begin the game at the end as you fire the last bullet into a formidable robot and save the galaxy from certain doom, only to plunge into a time vortex mere seconds later. Now you have to move backwards in time undoing your past deeds in order to keep the time continuum in tack (and more importantly Rick's reputation).\n\nLucky for you it seems Rick and the enemies he fought have a musical mind about them and have timed every shot and movement to the notes of songs, which is where you come in. For anyone who's played a Guitar Hero, Rock Band, or Dance Dance Revolution game this is going to feel right at home. Color coded bullets and obstacles come at you from the side of the screen, and you need to hit them in time with the beat and melody of the song to clear them. Where Retro/Grade differentiates itself is that while you are clearing your own notes (read: bullets) you also need to be dodging the enemies attacks as well, which range from lasers to giant robot legs to maze like bullet patterns and more. It's hard to truly understand just how it works until you've played it yourself, but it's the sort of idea that is so inherently brilliant that it makes you wonder how no one came up with it before.\n\nRetro/Grade's soundtrack is atypical of the games it emulates,. A collection of electro tracks with a serious groove to them, full of catchy riffs and fantastic breakdowns, it's impossible not to bob your head to the beat along with Rick. And what music game is complete without flashy epilepsy inducing visuals? The presentation on the whole is top notch, and the little details like the way enemies reconstruct themselves as you fly backwards and bullets suck themselves back into the barrels they came from add a lot of character.\n\nI do have one major problem, and that is there is both too much and too little here. There are only ten tracks to play, which while I wouldn't say any are bad, even the best songs become tiresome after you have heard it twenty times over a few hours. I also felt that the actual tracks dragged on longer than I would have liked, which is made worse by the repeating backgrounds going on behind you.\n\nGoing through story mode will likely take you under an hour to complete, but what is irritating is that you can't raise your difficulty without starting over from the first stage. There are challenge levels which unlock after you have completed the campaign, but here the repetition of the soundtrack becomes hard to ignore as there are dozens of challenges to complete all utilizing the same pool of songs. Had the existing tracks been cut short and a few more added I would have likely completed a lot more of them, but after a while I began to resent the game for making me replay what felt like the same stage again and again.\n\nBecause of the short tracklist it is a bit hard to recommend Retro/Grade at full price, but at a discount it is definitely something worth checking out. The basic ideas are very clever and I found it a lot of fun despite lacking much staying power. Although my preferred way to play was with an old guitar controller, you can certainly manage with either a controller or keyboard (albeit on lower difficulty settings), and each provides an interesting dynamic. If you were among the many who lamented the decreased innovation and change in the Guitar Hero games but never quite got sick of basic gameplay you will likely find Retro/Grade to be a very pleasant surprise.","December 15, 2013","true","1.7"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","5"

A regular controller works very well up to about medium difficulty, but I had some trouble with the higher difficulties in having to sequentially switch multiple lines very quickly, where the guitar's instantaneous any-line switching made things a lot easier and enjoyable.  Keyboard control is another option, and might actually be a better option than a regular controller, now that I think about it..\n\nReally great music, dazzling graphics, intricate details, even more impressive that it came from a 2-person dev team.  One of them has a really interesting GDC talk about the obsessive development process and the effects it had on his personal life, linked from the "Did this game really sell so poorly?" thread in the game's Steam forum, a recommended watch regardless of interest in this particular game.","December 3, 2013","true","4.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

It's a good really fun rhythm game, with an amazing soundtrack.  I don't think there was a song I disliked.  The object of the game is to undue your projectiles, so that you can save time or something,  It's really fun, not too difficult.  There are 6 difficulty settings ranging from beginner to X-treme.  The campaign on normal took me 2 hours, but the other 10 hours came from the challenge mode, which were boring at first because they were easy.  But then the difficulty gets so high, 5 levels away from the goal you have to perfectly do X-treme tracks, which requires a lot of repetitive practice, and if you are playing the game daily you will get that.  At first if you start up the game and look at the extreme level of tracks you'll be amazed at the difficulty level, but through challenge mode you'll be impressed at your ability to eventually be able to do what you thought was impossible, so very rewarding I say.  For 10$ it's a great game just for the music alone, but the gameplay is also great.  If you do not like rhythm games though it's not for you.  I recommend this game easily.","October 31, 2014","true","12.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

It has a great, original concept and the soundtrack is wonderful.\n\nEDIT: The game seemed very difficult at first due to its unorthodox gameplay, but I grasped the controls quickly and the first three difficulty levels (there are six in total) were a breeze. I now have to beat the last two, and now I wish I had a guitar controller :)\n\nThe challenge mode is also very satisfying. Their difficulites vary greatly as well. There are only 10 tracks in the whole game, but the challenge mode does manage to spice up the game. The challenges are not necessarily "more difficult" than their corresponding campaign levels - sometimes they are easier, sometimes they make you wonder "...is that even possible??".\n\nAlso, if you have FPS problems you can just try listening to the music and keep the beats without concentrating too much on the screen instead of meddling with your settings.\n\nOh, and completing all of the Steam Achievements is very, very difficult (practically impossible for me, but I don't know about you, dear possibly-obsessive-shooter-loving-review-reading-person.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/222660/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Retro/Grade is a rhythm game designed to appear like a Shoot 'em Up played in reverse. You will be retrieving bullets and missiles that you have fired, missing these will cause the time-line to become damaged and missing enough of them will result in a game over. It is a neat idea and you will definitely want to check out the tutorial before playing. However, it is terrible at introducing you to game's mechanics as they will throw them all at you at a rapid pace before you get your bearings. It is a pretty difficult game to get the hang of but if you stick with it, it will eventually click. The biggest obstacle to overcome will be the environments themselves, they are filled with clutter and moving objects, making you feel unsure if they are going to crash into you and can also be distracting. Starting the game you will see an option to play Campaign, Challenges, Practice or Tutorial. Contrary to most other games, you will want to start with Challenge mode. Campaign is pretty much the same thing but unlocks nothing.\n\nIn Campaign you will play through all 10 songs on whichever of the multiple difficulty levels that you choose. The problem is that the songs while pretty catchy, do start to sound similar and with 130 challenges all playing the same 10 songs you will likely burn out before you unlock any characters or artwork. Challenge mode starts on novice and scales the difficulty the further in you go and occasionally adds small tweaks to the gameplay to spice things up. Compared to merely selecting a difficulty and having to start from the first song every time you want to turn up the difficulty, the difference in the fun factor is huge. In novice mode there are only two different lanes to worry about and the higher the difficulty, the more lanes are added, up to five of them. In these lanes there will also be enemy bullets and running in to them will also mess up the time-line, which is essentially your health bar. You can revert time a bit to rewind to where you messed up and have another shot to do it right as long as you have “fuel” in your spaceship. Fuel is solely used to travel back in time, not an actual necessity to keep your ship flying. It is refilled by hitting a note (retrieving a bullet) that has a whirling energy effect that can contain fuel, a score multiplier or an “Overboard” power-up. Overboard is another way to increase your scores when hitting notes but at the cost of being blinded by colors for a while.\n\nThere are three forms of “notes” to collect, bullets which require a single button press and precise timing, rockets where you mash the button until they are all gone and laser beams that require you to hold the button until it is all retrieved. It's all done with either the spacebar or the A button on the 360 pad. It will result in you just pressing one button over and over again which can get a tad repetitive though pressing it unnecessarily will severely damage your score. Your score goes down depending on how well you do and the main objective is to reach a score of zero on the leader-boards strangely enough. You also start the campaign on the credits screen and make your way back to the the start of the game. It all sounds very weird and creative but in reality it works the same as the levels in any other game since they get progressively harder as you make your way through instead of starting at its hardest. It is explained why in a tongue in cheek way but when it comes down to it, this whole 'in reverse' thing is really just a gimmick. A cool idea but still ends up playing very similarly to most rhythm games. The shump aspects are introduced via boss projectiles that you must avoid in certain levels and they do take their sweet time to let you go back to the rhythm parts.\n\nChallenge mode has a cool over-world that has many branching paths and black holes that allow to skip large sections of missions. Reaching an icon of a lock on the over-world through making a path from the levels you cleared will unlock new goodies and the fact that they are so visible makes you want to reach them even more. Unfortunately the challenges themselves get old fast due to how stretched out the 10 song soundtrack is. To counteract this they could have made small unique challenges in certain areas of each song but instead they decided to make you play through the whole song. These songs are not short and will take you the better part of 5 minutes each, making it so that getting that alluring unlockable, you will have to invest a lot of time in songs you have already played to death to clear a path to it. You will be doing that for 130 missions assuming you don't fail any and have to restart it. If you played the campaign before this then that issue is worsened even more. Truth be told it would have been better if they mixed both the campaign and challenge mode to create a smaller, quality experience instead of a bunch of filler. Retro/Grade is a fun game for a while but stretched itself unbelievably thin, causing it to rapidly feel more like a chore than anything else.","November 11, 2015","false","3.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

It suffers from a number of issues, but it's still worth your time and money, if you're into this genre.\n\nThe graphics are very well done, but they're too obtrusive, often obscuring vital information. It's strange to see such a big focus on the graphics, when rhythm games function almost without any graphics. It's about timing and precision. The game has several little details on bosses and backgrounds that are lost, since you can't be appreciating how pretty a game looks when playing a game of this type that requires lots of concentration.\n\nOh well. It does have some options to disable effects and add guide-lines, so the problem can be diminished.\n\n\nThe game only has 10 songs, and thus, 10 levels on the campaign. While that may sound very little, take in mind that there are 6 difficulty settings, which creates different levels, effectively. It also have a very extensive challenge system. Too extensive, honestly. The challenges are the same levels as in the campaign, but they start in lower difficulties, and progressively introduce higher ones. They also change rules and unlock a ton of extras. They change color lanes, mirror things, some require perfect timing, etc. etc. Very cool!\nHowever, having 130 challenges does get painfully slow.\n\n\nThe biggest problem, in my opinion, is how the game never explains itself very well. It's a big issue regarding controls and higher difficulties. While it supports Guitar, Controller and Keyboard, using Keyboard is almost impossible in the 2 highest difficulties.\nI was playing with a controller. It was wonderful. The controls were perfectly timed with the songs, and it felt really good! Until I reached that difficulty wall. So, I tried to find my guitar hero controller and play with it. Well, at that point, it was very difficult to transition between the 2 controllers, with wildly different control methods.\nI had to go back a few difficulty levels and relearn everything, with a less interesting game, as the levels were slower than what I was used it.\n\nAll of that could have been avoided if the game was more transparent. Unfortunately, since it didn't do well on Playstation, the developer decided to shift focus away from the guitar... which was a poor decision, in my opinion.\n\n\nSo yeah, it's not perfect. There's a song that has an awkward transition, but all of the rest are really fun to play! They all have different sections, connecting the songs with the levels very nicely.\n\nIt's not a genre that we see often on PC, so definitely give it a go, it's great!\n\nP.S.: I played 10.6 hours without any issue of this sort, but the game just reset my progress after this whole time. I was only playing the challenges at this point, and was pretty far into it. I didn't feel like doing it all again, so I decided to just drop the game.\nStill very much enjoyed my time with it!","June 26, 2015","true","10.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The concept is a solid and surprisingly innovative one - you play as a hero in a rocket ship and start off at what would be the final stage of a traditional side-scrolling shooter game. But the catch here is that the game then throws you into reverse, forcing you to re-live your past actions and it does this all while set to the backdrop of a throbbing techno beat.\n\nBut for all its efforts, Retro/Grade suffers from some poor execution, some baffling design and odd choices of gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe first thing that most fans of the rhythm genre will notice is that, unlike other similar titles, it's almost impossible to fully memorize the game via reflex and this is especially true on higher difficulties (the difficulties add more beat lanes and increase the amount of on-screen activity with each tier). This represents the game's core challenge - but it's a challenge that feels artificial/inorganic and thrown in solely for the sake of it. It prevents a player from being truly perfect at the game (unless you're some superhuman being able to foresee every move you need to make seconds in advance and react accordingly).\n\nAnother thing, and perhaps the one thing that can prove absolutely frustrating to anyone looking to play this game casually, is that there is a vast amount of activity going on during a level, even on the lower difficulties. Drawing from my own experience, when I first began playing the game I reacted to a number of things that were merely background dressing (additional ships, space debris and other assorted things) and neglected the things that I was supposed to be focusing on in order to not completely fail the level(s) I was playing at the time.\n\nAdded onto that, the game's default settings have a graphical option that highlights a number of things on screen (for the sake of being visually stimulating to the player) and when coupled with everything else it becomes a chore to keep your attention focused on where it should be. I eventually became displeased with it and disabled it, noticing that it lessened the visual clutter a small degree though it still leaves something to be desired in terms of eliminating possible sources of distraction.\n\nOverall, Retro/Grade has a very novel concept but seems to sacrifice too much in order to accommodate that concept. It would definitely have seen some benefit from consideration put towards potential visual stimuli overload and perhaps a more sane approach to dealing with the oncoming beat traffic (realistically the player shouldn't be splitting their attention toward both ends of the screen when the beats are coming in from the right side only and often get lost amongst the hail of all the other activity - this being especially true on higher difficulties).\n\nIt is an enjoyable game, but the novelty wears off quickly. 24 Caret Games have a lot to be proud of as a result of their game but hopefully they also show a willingness to learn from their mistakes when they develop future titles.\n\nBased on my experiences, I find it hard to recommend the game due to the flaws mentioned but didn't fully dislike it either (since there's no way to be ambivalent with the recommendation, I'm giving it the thumbs down somewhat begrudgingly). However, the game is playable and readily enjoyable if you stick to the lower difficulties but that can only carry the enjoyment of this title so far before boredom sets in, forcing your curiosity to merit encountering the shortcomings of the game or simply abandoning it in favor of a more accessible title in the same genre.","May 21, 2014","false","6.0"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","18","31","0","0"

I've been a fan ever since the 2008 IGF demo and still keep coming back to the game every now and then. There are certainly better rhythm games, some of which are free, but there's plenty worse and few are as unique or as visually stunning as this one is.\n\nThe basic principle of the game is that not only are you playing a rhythm game, but you are also playing a shoot em up (in reverse!) which means you have to dodge enemy bullets coming from behind you at the same time as trying to hit the beats in front of you. This forces you to play different as you can't always line up in advance to hit the next beat; you may have to swerve around an incoming bullet. Sometimes there are sections of the song entirely based around avoiding enemy bullets giving you a slight break from all the chaos whilst still keeping you on your toes. It's a simple addition which adds a lot of depth and challenge to the game.\n\nFor me the difficulty felt just fine. It starts easy enough and steadily progresses harder. You are afforded plenty of mistakes and you can even rewind so it's very forgiving. There's two modes: Story mode and challenge mode. Story mode is just a straight progression through the game's 10 levels whilst challenge mode offers over 100 challenges with various stipulations such as playing at a faster speed or playing the track mirrored. The problem is that progress in one does not affect the other; story progress does not unlock challenges. If you complete the story, you'll have to start from the very beginning with very easy challenges for a long while before you can unlock challenging ones on par with the last mission.\n\nAnd while it looks beautiful, the visuals are sometimes a bit too much especially with songs that use all 5 lanes. Even with beat lines enabled it is sometimes hard to tell what's going on. However I find using the mono cheat which changes all the beats to one color and enemy bullets another significantly improves visibility and I would highly recommend it if you have issues. And the music is well composed but it's not very exciting and there are only 10 tracks.\n\nBut it's still a lot of fun. It's very mechanically solid and well polished. It supports pretty much any controller including a Guitar Hero or Rock Band guitar. An awful lot of work was put into this game and for the most part it shows. For what it is and considering all the free rythm games out there, $10 may seem a bit steep for what you get, especially if you're not into the music. I'd love to see a sequel but sadly due to how poorly this sold I doubt we'll be seeing any.","March 18","true","24.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game deserves a much higher player base.\n\nWhere to start? Well, obviously the aesthetics. This game is a visual splendor, due primarily to its backdrops (ever seen the sunset undone over a cityscape?), with its variety of projectiles lighting up around you, especially when you're in overdrive. Overdrive also intensifies the music up, down, & sideways, in a soundtrack that's already "groovy" overall. These tracks, available at 24 Carat Games' Bandcamp, stand strong on their own, most being the type of music that carries you along with it, syncing well with the gameplay, your hands, and involuntarily your body. Even at the first stage, this game secures its presentation, and playing on a laptop with headphones has only allowed me to appreciate it more. (For the less powerful machines out there, there's a few preset performance options, though you can select or deselect features as you will.)\n\nNow, the gameplay? Truth told, this IS my personal purpose of a guitar controller, and after discovering this capability in the options menu and laughably trying it out, I'd be reticent to play it any other way. (Note that switching to any lane is instantaneous on a guitar (and I assume the same of the keyboard), but is done one at a time on a gamepad.) I am not good at Guitar Hero (save for its "just strum the bar" easiest mode, which is boring), but Retro/Grade has a wide range of difficulty levels, from two lanes with modest notes to all five jam-packed. I doubt I'd ever bring myself to handle that level, but between the campaign and the challenges (with a tutorial and full practise mode alongside), I have surprised myself with my risen capability. The base gameplay involves "undoing" the character, Rick's, actions in what appears to be a horizontal "shmup", by intercepting your shots (by strumming the bar after lining yourself up) and reverse-dodging enemy fire. The feedback for messing up (distorting the timeline, where Rick had performed perfectly; the scant story to this game is a humorous read, both in scenario and composition) is clear, and you have the limited capability of forwarding yourself back in time to re-attempt undoing your non-mistake. The overdrive mentioned is this game's version of "star power", and ramps up the presentation and boosts your score decrements (remember, undoing things, here); the game defaults this function to the guitar's Select button and tilt function, but I'd recommend a controller with a dedicated button (such as just under your wrist). The focal projectiles, yours and your enemies, vary -- from bursts, beams, and barrages on your side to bursts, spreadshots, and frickin' black holes on theirs -- and the many challenges task you to added conditions, such as no errors, single or shifting color schemes, alternate speeds, and even the original pattern of an already tricky boss.\n\n**Because of the scheme of "reversed shmup", there are projectiles coming from both (or neither, for black holes) directions -- yours from the right, enemies' from the left -- which adds to the activity on-screen and especially as the difficulty risies requires an acute awareness from the player. The beauty of this is, as the game gradually demonstrates, dodging is as much set to the music as the target notes are, and even moving from lane to lane carries a rhythm, eventually allowing you to confidently skim just barely around obstacles as you become accustomed to the music. Still, keep wary, as the bright nature of the visuals could lead to overlooking a projectile 'til it's on top of you.\n\nFor the rest, there are unlockable galleries (photo sets and the music for use in a turntable*), ships (one of the earliest is a T-rex from Go Home Dinosaurs!), and "cheats" (such as an aptly-inflated head...), all via the challenge mode. There are also visibility options, both in turning off the aforementioned effects and in making the notes denoted. And, for you score-seekers, there's a leaderboard for anything but individual challenges (the challenge mode, IIRC, just uses a points system rather than specific score).\n\ntl;dr - This game is great on its own, and when paired with the guitar controller becomes something even its designated games could envy outside of party purposes.\n\n*As of my last attempt, I couldn't get the turntables to start, as they weren't reacting to my green button, nor the mouse, though the latter may've been functionally superceded by the former.\n--- --- ---\nIf I were to compare to other games (aside from GH/RB, due to prefered controller), I might say...\n- Skullgirls' accessibility (more via gameplay than extensive tools)\n- Shatter's aesthetics (esp. as paired with arcade gameplay)\n- Audiosurf's basic interface (primarily for targets; obstaces are from behind**)","December 4, 2013","true","4.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Browsing through the games on Steam, I came upon this game, and after watching the video, I had to purchase it immediately. If you've ever been a fan of side scrolling shooters, rhythm games, or even just colorful games that give your eyeballs this wonderful explosion of bright vivid colors that would satisfy even the most skeptical player. It's so much fun to watch, and even more fun to play.\n\nThis game is a very pattern oriented reverse rhythm shooter, and it's the only game like it out there. This is why it needs to be played.\n\nThere are various levels of difficulty as one can imagine in a game like this. The easiest mode starts out on three planes of the field, being able to switch between them at any time, and the goal is to dodge the missiles that are coming from behind you as the level reverses, but at the same time, you are re-absorbing the shots you fired at the enemies. It is more intense than it sounds, but the good kind. The kind that makes one want to continue to play. As you advance further into the game, the beats become more abundant, and more things start happening on the screen as you have more planes to play from, all the way up to six in total, making the game a veritable bevy of colorful explosions.\n\nIf Arcade mode doesn't tickle your fancy, then there is always the fun of challenge mode, where you advance through a map that is a specific stage where you must complete the objective. This can range from getting a specific amount of Greats, to not going below a specific score for the level, and even being required to have a certain rank upon completing the level. As you play these challenges, you also unlock other things in the game, like more ships, cheat modes (Disco mode is my absolute favorite) and stage music unlocked to play in the jukebox. There is a great amount of stages to play, so you will never be bored with this game.\n\nFor what you pay for this game, you're getting a great amount of content. Every time I find myself looking for something to play, I almost always go for Retro/Grade first because it's easy to pick up, play and put back down to come back to later, and if you're like me, you keep on coming back to it, months and months later.","December 27, 2013","true","35.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Going into the “tutorial” level I fully understood that Retrograde is not actually a shootem’ up game, in fact it is literally the inverse. The key mechanic here is that you are going backwards through time and instead of shooting enemies, you must suck back up all the shots you fired in a precise rhythm while re-dodging the shots taken at you from behind. Trying to explain how this game plays is rather complicated but imagine playing guitar hero where the notes come from in front and behind you.\n\nNeedless to say, the game is brutal difficulty wise.

When I first started the tutorial I was expecting to be playing (reverse) Gradius to the beat of an awesome soundtrack; But instead what I got was Guitar Hero executed in a way that I had never thought of: To keep the music going while avoiding enemy fire!\n\nThe graphics on the game are very vibrant and the colors perfectly compliment the 2-5 lane system. Each lane uses the same color coordination as all the well-known plastic guitars out there for other rhythm games; Not only was it a blessing in disguise to be given something so familiar to me within the genre, but the mixture of colors on-screen from all the attacks made a fantastic light-show! Sometimes the screen could get cluttered with different colors and certain attacks could get very hard to see through all the explosions and other effects on screen, but with enough practice with each level has a pattern that you can follow or sometimes predict to compensate for this problem.\n\nThe difficulty scales from "So easy that it's almost hard to play" all the way to "There's so much going on I don't even know what to do!" I found myself preferring the X-Treme difficulty not because it was harder, but because all of the shots felt perfectly in-tune with the music; However, the lower difficulties did well at teaching you how the game works and allowing you to easily learn the system to advance to the next difficulty. The biggest grace about playing on X-Treme difficulty is that with so many more notes to hit every one shows you the route to avoid enemy fire, so I was able to focus more on what I needed to hit and less on how I was going to find the path to hit it.\nAlso: It's interesting to note how much each level changes to accommodate the new difficulty level. When adding another lane to play on naturally you would need more enemies on screen, but what really shined were the boss levels and how their interactions and patterns changed, making the replaying of each level feel less of a chore and more like a new level all together.\n\nThe controls are super simple on both the controller and guitar (I never tried it on keyboard nor had any intentions to do such.) The A button is king and has many different uses based on what's coming at you. From holding it down to fire a beam, to rapidly mashing rockets, to single-fire shots, one button is all you need to take on all the levels. On the other hand, if you've got a plastic guitar handy, this game can really show off your skills. I actually found it more challenging to play the game with the guitar because you have to incrementally slide everywhere to avoid getting hit from behind by enemy fire; It almost feels like you're playing two different stages at the same time in this game because you have to slide from lane to lane avoiding enemy fire and at the same time make sure you're in place to hit the notes coming at you from the other side.\n\nTo be honest, I'm good at playing the Guitar when all that's coming at me are notes and I just have to get the timing right or at least memorize the song, but this game actually went beyond my current capabilities with the guitar and that concerns me. I know it's fully possible to beat on the highest difficulty and most likely has been done by someone at least during testing, but I feel that when a rhythm game is more easily played on an xbox or ps4 controller than on a controller specifically made for use with rhythm games, something has gone wrong. I've tried playing Guitar Hero with a PS controller… it was almost impossible for me at higher difficulties. This game feels exactly the same way just in reverse (Hah, almost ironic when thinking about the game's story.)\n\n\nVerdict:\n\nIf you're a fan of rhythm games and want to try something new: This game will fit quite well in your collection regardless of your skill level with the genre. The price is extremely reasonable for the game.

The twist here is that you are playing the game from the end to the beginning because space-time is unravelling, and you have to repeat all the moves that got you to the end to preserve the continuum.\n\nSo, yeah, it looks like a space shooter, and it's gorgeous, but it's actually a rhythm game. You have several tracks on the screen you can move your ship to, dodging enemy fire and hitting your own "fire" button with the game prompts you to. Like I said, the idea is to go through the game backwards, copying everything the character had supposedly done before the game started.\n\nThe game, like I said, is beautiful, and the music is pretty awesome as well. I did find the game pretty short, however; there are only 10 stages, and after you beat them you can knock around on the "challenge" map, but it's all the same levels with different "challenges" imposed. Some of them are interesting (playing the level again with "disco lighting" is pretty cool), but otherwise it's kind of short. Overall, though, it's pretty fun while it lasts, with an interesting gameplay mechanic that's worth at least trying out.","June 20, 2014","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Tatakae! Ouendan or Beat Hazard, you should definately try this overlooked little gem. The game's formula is simple: you fly back in time in your tiny rocket, dodging enemy bullets and un-firing yours. However, it is extremely polished. Original electronic sound, flasy neon graphics and intense gameplay meld tougether into an almost synesthetic experience of audiovisual rhythmic meditation. The only thing this game lacks is content: it has just 10 levels (plus a bunch of challenges) and doesn't support custom ones. Which is a shame, since this gameplay would be great for any of your favorite chiptune tracks. Retro/Grade would greatly benefit from a workshop if it ever happens.

You'll be un-shooting those lasers, bullets and bombs in time to a beat. It's a very interesting premise for a game and as fun to play as it sounds. Depending on the difficulty, you'll be weaving in and out of between 2 and 5 lanes, dodging your enemies shots as they return to sender and colliding with your own to reverse their effect. The difficulty ramps up at a fair pace and the core difficulty settings mean it's accessible to casual and core gamers alike.\n\nThe problem is, there's very little content here. The game offers just ten levels. Sure, the developer has attempted to beef up that content by adding a challenge mode and multiple difficulties, it just doesn't mask the fact that the base content is rather thin. Imagine buying a copy of Guitar Hero with only 10 songs on offer and you'll have a good idea of what's on offer here.\n\nRetro/Grade is undeniably fun but gets a cautious thumbs up due to that lack of content.

I have to admit, I'm not a fan of traditional rhythm based games.  However, the mixing of rhythm game mechanics with a shoot-em-up game moving *backwards* through time was quite a brilliant and original idea. There are other mechanics layered on top of this, such as the time warp ability which lets you undo events (oddly, by moving *forward* through time), that make it even further removed from traditional games of the rhythm genre.\n\nThe original music score is great.  The graphics are very slick and offer a light show that syncs with the beat, and overall the game feels very polished.\n\nThat being said however, the game gets a bit too disorienting at times with all the colors on screen flashing at once, especially in higher difficulty settings or during more complex challenges.  Luckily this isn't a problem if you play at lower difficulty settings and avoid the challenges.\n\nThe only issues I've had, besides the occasional "epilepsy-inducing" light shows, is getting the audio beats and visual hits to line up.  There are thankfully audio and video adjustment options that help with timing, but it can be tricky to get it working perfectly.  Its worth visiting these menu options especially if you have audio or visual latency issues, the former of which can be amplified by having DTS or DD surround sound encoding on, and the latter which can be dependent on the type of monitor, graphics card, and even cable length you have.\n\nOverall, this is one of my favorite "original concept" games.","January 11, 2015","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I like the stage design, the concept, the art, and the surprising amount of content (in challenge mode). And yeah, at first I enjoyed it. But very quickly it begins to feel like a chore. It's like every stage is the same thing but with different layouts and visuals, and it feels like it takes forever to end.\n\nThe basic gameplay is a rhythm game. Hit keys when a note comes at the right time. But now, let's add some dodging to that mechanic. So now you have to avoid hitting notes coming from another direction. Okay. Now we add in different styles of notes, like sustaining or button mashing. Then we add more stuff to dodge but on the opposing side as well. As you can see, things can get a little out of hand quickly. You must keep track of stuff coming from behind you, in front of you, above and below you, hit keys at the right time, hold keys at the right time, mash keys at the right time, the list goes on. This isn't a complaint, mind you, it's just a precaution of what to expect.\n\nFor the masochists out there, you can go set the game to higher difficulty settings, and the game becomes devilishly hard, as you need to keep track of many lanes and lights coming from both sides of the screen.\n\nThe campaign was all right. I liked the humor about doing everything in reverse. I would have liked a deeper story, but I understand it's not that sort of game. Oddly, if you go right to the challenge modes after completing the campaign, you are met with a bunch of super easy stages until you finally work your way to the harder ones, which take far more time and effort than the entire campaign itself.\n\nI'm unsure if this game actually has Cloud support or not. The store page says it does, but in my library it doesn't show support, nor does it sync after the game ends. I suspect it did at one point, and then vanished.\n\nGiven that it's a rhythm game, then the single most important thing about it would have to be the music. This is arguably the game's weakest point. I do believe the monotony of the stages would have been acceptably fun if the music was good and varied. In its current state, most of the songs sound similar to each other, and playing each one for several minutes quickly creates a droning state of mind where you're just going through the motions, but not really feeling it. Heck, maybe even do a few vocal tracks.\n\nDespite my criticisms, I appreciate what the dev tried to create here. I feel it should have performed much better than it did, and hopefully others will stumble onto it as I did. I'm recommending the game because I feel the dev has talent and can make something truly special in the future.","April 25, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A bit short on content which leads to a lot of repetition though. The challenge mode ended up being too tedious for me to want to trudge through entirely... playing through the same few songs over and over with slightly different rules is not very exciting. The campaign is the more enjoyable part for me, at least, on X-Treme specifically. Quite a challenge and a rush, certainly, though I contest the fairness of some of the enemy fire types but what do I know. Well. The black hole bombs don't seem to function right, for one. Sometimes they work, sometimes I'm holding away from them the entire time and don't budge an inch. Mostly problematic when trying to go for perfect plays of a level. Also, the achievements for high ranks don't scale, which means a lot of tedium if you want to be bothered going for them. Another issue I find is that the colors are, really, too much. Sometimes it's hard to even spot enemy shots or your own fire. So as a whole the game is mildly unfair. Doesn't stop it from being tons of fun though, as long as you're not worried about perfecting its levels.","May 17, 2014","true","25.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pyyhkari/recommended/222660/","pyyhkari","Pyyhkari","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pyyhkari/","848 products in account","Retro/Grade essentially boils down to a rhythm game where you move the cursor up and down the lanes, trying to avoid whatever comes from one direction and match the marks coming from the other. Add in 3D graphics that make the accurate timing harder than it should be and the end result is a game that isn't all that much fun.\n\nR/G is possibly better known as the previous project from the creator of Neverending Nightmare, which featured in a number of stories and interviews on various gaming websites.\n\nThe "cursor" the player guides is a spaceship, trying to undo his actions leading to the end (the start of the game) as the time is rewinded. This means ducking enemy bullets coming back from the behind and "unshooting" bullets coming from the front. Make enough mistakes and the spacetime continuum will collapse. It's almost like a Star Trek TNG episode.\n\nSo, why not recommend this?\n\nOne, the ship is viewed from an angle, which makes timing the unlaunching and avoiding enemy bullets unnecessarily difficult. Many other rhythm games do this on a 2D plane (Dance Dance Revolution, Sequence), which helps a lot to time stomps/button presses accurately. In a way, form was prioritized over function.\n\nSecond, as you might guess, the game is played on lanes. The easy mode has only two lanes, mediumcore has three. While the trappings of a shoot'em up being played in reverse are a novel idea, being constrained to lanes felt like having one arm tied behind my back.\n\nI played through the campaign mode in 55 minutes on medium core, without having to restart a game at any point, and maybe about once having to re-rewind time (think Prince of Persia) to avoid failing a level. I did give the hardest difficulty level a quick try and couldn't finish even the first level, so there is challenge to be found. The game also has separate challenge modes, which are individual game levels but with a different goal, not all that much unlike what NES Remix has on the Wii U.","May 23, 2014","false","1.1"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

It is a rhythm game with a rather unique premise - your goal is to undo your previous actions to ensure the stability of time and space. And in order to do that you'll be pressing buttons (well, the spacebar) in time to the beat. Gameplay is quickly learned and mostly feels intuitive, and you also have the option to undo your mistakes! That's right, you can rewind time and dodge that shot or get in that perfect hit. It's a pretty nice mechanism.\n\nGraphically, the game is also nice. When I played most of my focus was on incoming lasers and shots, but the backgrounds change as the stage goes on and are generally well-crafted. The main campaign consists of ten stages and I beat it relatively quickly, but you can always go back and try to improve your score. Your scores automatically appear on the leaderboard as well. In addition to the main campaign there's also a challenge mode, where you can unlock artwork and a sound test.\n\nThere are several difficulty settings, so it's easy to adjust the game to the challenge you want. The soundtrack is decent, by that I mean that it does the job but it's not something I would listen to on its own. It works well during gameplay though, and mostly it's easy to pick out the rhythm and respond accordingly.\n\nAll in all, it's a quirky little rhythm game and it's nice enough to pick up for some quick fun, and once you beat the main campaign there are still the challenges to complete.","August 22, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, you're controlling a little space ship, but the whole time, you're reversing through the levels, taking your shots back after the game was completed previously by the protagionist.\n\nIt's music style is electronic, all done in house, and it is excellent.  Who's The Boss is the standout track in my opinion, but it's all good.  Taking the shots back happens on the beat, all while avoiding the enemie's fire, which is also being taken back in time to the beat.\n\nIt's closest in style to Frequency or Amplitude, with the style of music and the many bright colours distracting you from the beat.  The higher the difficulty selected, the more bars are active, starting with two and working up to 5.  It pulls some inspiration from Rock Band, even letting you hook up an USB guitar to strum along to the game, but as I mentioned before, much closer to Amplitude/Frequency in visual style and music.\n\nAll and all, an excellent rhythm game with a great soundtrack and plenty to do: 10 mission campaign mode, 6 difficulties for that, a large challenge mode, a music mix mode, and lots of little extras.","September 24, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a rhythm game with a rather unique premise - your goal is to undo your previous actions to ensure the stability of time and space. And in order to do that you'll be pressing buttons (well, the spacebar) in time to the beat. Gameplay is quickly learned and mostly feels intuitive, and you also have the option to undo your mistakes! That's right, you can rewind time and dodge that shot or get in that perfect hit. It's a pretty nice mechanism.\n\nGraphically, the game is also nice. When I played most of my focus was on incoming lasers and shots, but the backgrounds change as the stage goes on and are generally well-crafted. The main campaign consists of ten stages and I beat it relatively quickly, but you can always go back and try to improve your score. Your scores automatically appear on the leaderboard as well. In addition to the main campaign there's also a challenge mode, where you can unlock artwork and a sound test.\n\nThere are several difficulty settings, so it's easy to adjust the game to the challenge you want. The soundtrack is decent, by that I mean that it does the job but it's not something I would listen to on its own. It works well during gameplay though, and mostly it's easy to pick out the rhythm and respond accordingly.\n\nAll in all, it's a quirky little rhythm game and it's nice enough to pick up for some quick fun, and once you beat the main campaign there are still the challenges to complete.","August 22, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did, and now here we are years later and Retro/Grade has emerged as a personal favorite I come back to for a half hour at a time, a couple days a week. Given the size and breadth of my library and the Steam store itself, that's quite a feat.\n\nI was a huge fan of Frequency and Amplitude in the PS2 days, though it took until Rock Band 2 to get me into the plastic instruments fad. I enjoy the rhythm genre immensely from both casual and challenging standpoints; if you do too, Retro/Grade is a surefire buy. The control scheme takes some getting used to, but the game is clearly a labor of love by a developer that had a great idea and polished the hell out of it. Great music, unique mechanics and a clever storyline. The levels are sadly few (what I would give for this to be a Steam Workshop game!), but that just gives you an excuse to hone your craft on the increasing complexity of the available runs.\n\nI can't even remember how much I paid for this (probably launch price), but whatever it was, it was well worth it.","January 8, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every level looks and plays differently, so you don't feel like you're doing the same thing over and over.  That said, you're still dodging obstacles in every level, so there's a certain limit to how much variation there can be.  The obstacles you must avoid and the shots you must collect are well timed to the beat of the music, making it a very relaxing game where you can just zone out and be absorbed in the music.\n\nFor such a fun game, it's a bit disappointing that there are only 10 levels, which you can probably beat in a day.  But there is a challenge mode that allows you to play the levels with certain modifications, such as being sped up, not being allowed to make any mistakes, having the color-coded "space lanes" being turned off, etc.  Challenge mode lets you unlock extras such as skins for your spaceship, disco mode, concept art, and other stuff.  The only thing I don't like is that some of the challenges are way too easy.. some have reduced speed, unlimited fuel, things like that. You can skip challenges, but if you want to unlock everything and get all the achievements you're going to have to slog through several boring ones.\n\nThe graphics in this game are beautiful.  All of the backgrounds are fully animated, with flashing lights timed to the music and space ships flying around.  The downside is that it can be a bit overwhelming visually.  I found it distracting at first, but I got used to only focusing on the things I need to see.  Which kind of defeats the purpose of highly detailed backgrounds I suppose.  If you are overstimulated easily, this might not be a good game for you.\n\nThis game regularly goes on sale for $2 or lower.

There are a couple of additional mechanics added into the mix such as power-ups and power-downs and a double multiplier, but I would argue the most important ability is the one to reverse time, which allows you to reverts your mistakes and even takes you away from the game over screen, and facilitates clearing up the levels, however if you decide to use the ability there's a big chance you won't be getting a good score at the end of the song.\n\nThe game appears to have little replay value when  it's played for the first time but  in reality it contains has 10 levels, 6 difficulties and scoreboards which should be enough to keep you entertained for at least 6 hours (Especially because the last difficulty is brutal).\n\nNot to say the game doesn't have any annoyances, oh no it does have some. For instance I find playing the harder difficulties almost impossible to play with a keyboard, so I recommend sticking to using a gamepad, lines also seem to have registration problems from time to time and there's this one boss battle that I believe to be impossible to being hit by unless you replay the level over and over again and learn its pattern (And I'm not apparently the only one considering there's a pretty useless hint if you die on that battle telling you how to supposedly predict being hit by it).\n\nI would also argue some levels are way harder than others, for instance I believe the boss of the fourth area and the second-to-last area are waaaaay harder than the last one.\n\nBut alas, these are simple nit-picks and I'm overall happy with the game.\n\nI don't know if it's worth full price but if you're a rhythm game fan then this is a must buy on sale.","August 22, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have notes coming at you from the right side of the screen which you have to hit at the correct time. At the same time, there are projectiles coming at you from the left side of the screen which you have to avoid. When done properly, your "avoidance" maneuvers and your "strums" follow the beat of the music.\n\nThere are three control schemes, all of which are viable. If you have a guitar from a console rhythm game (360, PS3, Wii), that can be used to play the game. Alternatively, you can use your keyboard either to mimic a guitar, or in shooter-style, where you move the ship up and down with WASD or the arrow keys. Shooter-style is a bit more precise, but more tiring on the finger you use to control ship movement. Guitar-style is a bit more fun and spreads out the workload over all of your fingers, but certain maneuvers are a little tougher to pull off accurately.\n\nThere are multiple difficulty levels, ranging all the way up to five fingers. You cannot use your own music -- you play one of the ten premade tracks. Fun party game in any case, and can accommodate various skill levels.","May 19, 2013","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

There are a couple of additional mechanics added into the mix such as power-ups and power-downs and a double multiplier, but I would argue the most important ability is the one to reverse time, which allows you to reverts your mistakes and even takes you away from the game over screen, and facilitates clearing up the levels, however if you decide to use the ability there's a big chance you won't be getting a good score at the end of the song.\n\nThe game appears to have little replay value when  it's played for the first time but  in reality it contains has 10 levels, 6 difficulties and scoreboards which should be enough to keep you entertained for at least 6 hours (Especially because the last difficulty is brutal).\n\nNot to say the game doesn't have any annoyances, oh no it does have some. For instance I find playing the harder difficulties almost impossible to play with a keyboard, so I recommend sticking to using a gamepad, lines also seem to have registration problems from time to time and there's this one boss battle that I believe to be impossible to being hit by unless you replay the level over and over again and learn its pattern (And I'm not apparently the only one considering there's a pretty useless hint if you die on that battle telling you how to supposedly predict being hit by it).\n\nI would also argue some levels are way harder than others, for instance I believe the boss of the fourth area and the second-to-last area are waaaaay harder than the last one.\n\nBut alas, these are simple nit-picks and I'm overall happy with the game.\n\nI don't know if it's worth full price but if you're a rhythm game fan then this is a must buy on sale.","August 22, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every level looks and plays differently, so you don't feel like you're doing the same thing over and over.  That said, you're still dodging obstacles in every level, so there's a certain limit to how much variation there can be.  The obstacles you must avoid and the shots you must collect are well timed to the beat of the music, making it a very relaxing game where you can just zone out and be absorbed in the music.\n\nFor such a fun game, it's a bit disappointing that there are only 10 levels, which you can probably beat in a day.  But there is a challenge mode that allows you to play the levels with certain modifications, such as being sped up, not being allowed to make any mistakes, having the color-coded "space lanes" being turned off, etc.  Challenge mode lets you unlock extras such as skins for your spaceship, disco mode, concept art, and other stuff.  The only thing I don't like is that some of the challenges are way too easy.. some have reduced speed, unlimited fuel, things like that. You can skip challenges, but if you want to unlock everything and get all the achievements you're going to have to slog through several boring ones.\n\nThe graphics in this game are beautiful.  All of the backgrounds are fully animated, with flashing lights timed to the music and space ships flying around.  The downside is that it can be a bit overwhelming visually.  I found it distracting at first, but I got used to only focusing on the things I need to see.  Which kind of defeats the purpose of highly detailed backgrounds I suppose.  If you are overstimulated easily, this might not be a good game for you.\n\nThis game regularly goes on sale for $2 or lower.  It's a fun casual game that's definitely worth that.","November 27, 2015","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like, I got super pumped up when the first stage started and the buildings in the background started lighting up to the beat of the music, I was like, "holy ♥♥♥♥, we're about to hear some kick-♥♥♥ music", and then all that happened was a dull, almost dismal-sounding synth playing one note per measure, which continued for most of the next four minutes. It sounded like the musical equivalent of high schoolers unentheusiastically reciting the pledge of allegience at school.\n\nSo, yeah, normally, that wouldn't be a problem, but since this is a game that revolves around music, it kind of brings it down.\n\nI'd give it an 8/10 overall.","February 8","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
