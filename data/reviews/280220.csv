You should never get it. Seriously. Once you have this, it will be a time sink forever. You can never finsh this game. It's a deceptive little game - you may think - "oh, there are only 23 missions in the Story  then I'm done."  But it's not so easy. Along your way you will unlock untold millions of additional maps. Then you can't stop playing them.\n\nI have been playing Creeper world since 2009 and I can't stop. I need to join the Creeper World Anonymous club and confess "Hi, my name is Karsten and I can't stop killing Creeper."\n\nYou can play in the Tormented Zone if you are a masochist and like inflicting pain on yourself. Some worlds in there are documented unwinnable[knucklecracker.com] - but that won't stop you from trying - it didn't stop me.\n\nOccasionally venture into Prospector zone and pick up a few Artifacts of Odin - the mightiest weapons mankind did not invent.\n\nTry out the Alpha sector. Made by those early beta testers. Made to be difficult. Make sure you try Virgil's Brainic map. Just to see how weird you can get.\n\nLike Shooters? Try out the Credits mission.  Hey, my name is in there somewhere - so are all the other beta testers. :)\n\nIf that's not enough, go dial up your own maps in the DMD (Dial Map Device), Here you can make a world with the click of a few buttons. Add ingredients to suit you and cook up a hard challenge or a speed run - win it, name it and share it with all us us addicts. Oh wait, I'm trying to stop playing. Don't share it.\n\nFinally, if you are creative, inventive and perhaps you like to add custom units and styles, make your own map in the Projects Editor and share it in Colonial Space. Here there are no rules. Maps are all over the place, fun, hard, tricky, unusual, huge slog-fests, or tiny puzzles. As large as 256x256 or as small as 20x20.  Don't say I didn't warn you. This is where "map rage" goes to live after you discover it at Farbor (the timed mission in the Story arc).\n\nI would tell you more, but it's time for my fix and Im heading out to the DMD to get a quick fix.\n\nOh yes, "Hi, my name is Karsten and I am killing Creeper."","March 16, 2014","true","601.7"," 691 of 715 people (97%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","97","691","715","9","26"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/recommended/280220/","mcdux0r","dux0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/","1067 products in account","I think Creeper World 3 catches a lot of people off guard because of the cheap price, low resolution graphics and understated appeal. It also gets called a Tower Defense game a lot, which does the unique strategic components a horrible injustice. Instead, Arc Eternal is a laid-back thinking mans' RTS with unprecedented play-more value and excels as a game you can sink some time into in the form of a well thought out and strictly controlled approach, or as a casual attack on a map every now and then. It's like Civilization V in the respect that you'll launch it for a quick 20 minute game and find yourself embroiled in the relentless depths of an alien planet fighting to make a foothold on a section of map on the 4th planet of your 3rd star system 6 hours later, wondering where the time went.\n\nThe amount of content in here is staggering, and the campaign provides such a good learning curve and introduction to the new structures and some possible strategies that can't be praised enough. There's also an engaging backstory in the main campaigns which help you feel isolated and alone while fighting the uncaring, unforgiving creep, and while the dialogue is cliche at times, it helps bolster the already engaging gameplay and add a little depth.\n\nHighlights\nThe best part of this game is simply the gameplay. While the tower defense mechanics have been done to death and don't offer anything particularly insightful, the different natures of the two opposing forces here make for a level of adaptable strategy that you wont see in many games. The structures are all balanced and simple but effective additions like Terraforming and one-use items make for even more ways to play and even more things to spend time working on.\n\nThe sheer amount of content is the other great part of this world, and deserves praise.\n\n* The first port of call is the Arc Eternal which acts as the campaign mode and teaches the player the basics and structures, and consists of 9 star systems for a total of approximately 50 levels.\n* There's the Alpha Sector which includes many early maps and a ton made by the alpha and beta players.\n* The Prospectors Zone features procedurally generated maps.\n* There's Tormented Space for those seeking challenge which includes maps from hard to literally impossible.\n* The Dial Map Device acts as a map generation tool and lets you play more specific maps.\n\nMistakes & Annoyances\nFor many, the simple enemy A.I. is an issue here, and it can be argued that the very flat nature of the enemy intelligence makes for a somewhat bland approach. I'd counterargue and say that this game is more about finding solutions you like, and/or finding the optimal or most efficient route to victory and that the focus doesn't need to be on the creep.\n\n* The difficulty curve isn't very smooth, and you can find yourself struggling way beyond what you'd expect in some of the later campaign missions, or struggling to overcome frustrating maps. There are also several outright impossible missions which nobody has yet been able to find a solution to.\n\nRecommendations\nArc Eternal comes priced at £10.99/14.99€/$14.99 and while it contains a huge amount of play time, including a main story of at least 15 hours, it's still probably slightly overpriced for most players when compared against competitors. It's one of those games which you'll either love or hate, and so playing the demos listed below, or the flash versions of the developers other titles before making a full priced purchase is recommended.\n\n* If the huge amount of content included by default wasn't enough for you, there are a ton of user maps too with different types of play. There are even Play as Creeper style maps.\n* Some of the earlier titles are also available for free play in Flash on Kongregate[www.kongregate.com].\n* There are demos of all 3 of the Creeper World games available on KnuckleCrackers' website which are much shorter.\n\nMore Reviews Like This  Underrated & Hidden Games on Steam","July 21, 2015","true","15.4"," 144 of 148 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","144","148","4","0"

But I always got a bit tired of the repetative movement of putting down another tower, upgrading them blah blah blah.... and then just leaving the game to run it's course, throwing wave after wave of enemies until your computer began to stutter and lag behind as it was somehow managing to cope with an incredible array of pixals being thrown into your eyeballs. I am mainly talking about the infamous Bloons TD, which will always remain my favourite TD, although there are others. However, this game is a little different in that respect.\n\nI like to think of it as a combination of a TD and RTS, in the sense that The Creeper, some blue liquid thing, is not stuck on rails and just has to get from A to B as it floats down a path ignoring all defences on its journey, it is instead open to go where it pleases, only limited by the geography of the landscape. The RTS element in the game is the fact that you build up cannons to protect your 'base' and resource collectors. They take time to build and must be placed strategically in order to maximise the efficiency of your defence and keep The Creeper at bay. After that, you must push forward and move your defences forward even more. But they can get delinked from getting resources, so extenders are put in place. On large maps, it can be very rewarding seeing a huge web of links and seeing your packages of Anti-Creeper and firepower flowing down these pathways.\n\nIn later missions, more enemies arise and give even more things to think about when planning out defences, but don't worry. A reasonably nice variety in defence types can help with that. But you'll have to play it in order to find out what.","December 30, 2014","true","15.6"," 51 of 52 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","51","52","4","1"

You are a captain of a ship who has just woken up after a very very long time in cryo sleep and in the time you have been gone humanity has vanished as all the civilasations that once were have been wiped out by the creeper, a strange organism which destroys everything it touches. At the time of writing this review I have only put in three hours and have barely scratched the surface but as you can see from other reviewers' play time there is a lot to this game and a lot of replayability.\n\n+Nice pixel graphics\n+Simple UI and great controls\n+A very interesting story\n+Interesting concept, instead of building towers in the path of an oncoming enemy you create networks of towers and take the fight to the enemy. There are small enemy towers which emitt the creepers which gradually spread across the map, using towers you have to beat back the creepers until your network of towers is close enough to use a special offensive tower which destroys the emitter. The gameplay is quite hard to explain and I probably haven't done it justice so it's best to watch some gameplay videos.\n+Your towers can be moved as the creepers are beaten back out of range of your towers\n+It's challenging without feeling too difficult or unfair\n+The mission menu is an interactive starmap and you get to see your ship travel from one planet or star system to another\n+Nice soundtrack\n+Can be paused at any point during a mission\n+You can create and share your own levels\n\n-Either some people are god-like at this game or the leaderboards have been cheated\n-If you make any mistakes with what you build early on in a mission it usually ruins your chances of winning, for example if you don't build enough reactors at the start and you run low on energy later in the game you will most likely be destroyed. It adds another layer of difficulty but it can be pretty annoying\n\nVerdict:\n9\n\nAn absolutely brilliant game that is more like an RTS than a TD with an impressively good story, a must buy for fans of either genre.\n\nEl K.","February 18, 2015","true","3.1"," 94 of 129 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","94","129","4","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueRaja/recommended/280220/","BlueRaja","BlueRaja","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueRaja/","2289 products in account","This is not a traditional tower defense game.  You don't build mazes.  You don't upgrade towers.  There are no units to attack.  Yet, it contains a lot of the same mechanics as TD games:  you build towers which attack for you;  you decide whether to spend or invest resources; you strategically place towers at the right places and times.  Thus, I don't feel uncomfortable categorizing this in the Tower Defense genre.\n\nThe game goes like this:  you expand your base to earn resources.  The larger the surface-area of your base, the more resources-per-second you earn.  Meanwhile, the "enemy" is simply a geyser of fluid (called "creeper") which spreads out in all directions.  If the fluid touches a tower, that tower dies.  You use your towers to push back the fluid, so you can get close enough to destroy the geyser(s).\n\nOn paper, it sounds stupid.  But then again, I would have said the same thing about TD games at first, and now they are my favorite genre.\n\nIn reality, this is a fantastic game.  The game constantly introduces new gameplay-elements throughout the campaign, keeping it fresh and unrepetitive.  The levels are never too easy, but also never too hard (the main campaign, at least).  And after beating the campaign, the game opens up hundreds of levels created by the developer, his friends, beta testers, etc. giving this game immense replayability.\n\nI've played a lot of TD games, and this is one of my top 3 TD games of all time (just behind Pathery[www.pathery.com] and Entropy TD[www.teamliquid.net]).  If you enjoy TD games, I personally guarantee you will enjoy this game. 10/10","August 24, 2014","true","15.1"," 34 of 34 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","34","34","0","1"

It's a bit tower defence, a bit RTS, and a bit of logistics / network optimisation... because your base is a router. The villain is a fluid (a refreshing change from zombies), and you can terraform the map to direct your liquid foe into reservoirs for ease of blasting.

I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nCreeper World 3: Arc Eternal is a perfect mix of RTS and Tower Defense along with aspects of slight management. You fight against a liquid like and versatile foe known as Creeper. This game has infinite, and I do mean nearly infinite replayability. Once you finish the base story you can go and do thousands of more missions created by the creators and the community. This is the best strategy game I have ever played. There is not much in this world like being completely surrounded by Creeper and slowly, ever so slowly pushing back and destroying every last piece of it. There are tons of ways to beat levels whether you want to attack swiftly with risk or play for a longer game to build your layout to counteract the ever attacking foe. You can even create anti-creeper or terraform the land around you to add even more to this games amazing functions. Overall this game has a very unique and formidable foe and is the best and one of the most exhilarating strategy games I have ever played.\n\nGraphics/Sounds\nI love the look of the creeper, weaponry, even the terrain. The music fits with the game giving an adventurous and formidable feel of the unknown.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Unique game playstyle\n+ Enormous amount of replayability\n+ Addicting\n+ Ranges from super easy to maps where you will wonder who was sadistic enough to make it\n+ Huge amount of maps to play\n+ Good story\n+ Map editor\n\nCons\n\n- May becomes repetitive to some\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI remember playing the first Creeper World on kongregate and thinking "I love this game, holy crap it's amazing". Next came Creeper World 3: Abraxis and I played it the moment it was available and again loved it but wished there was more than the 12 missions and then around a year later I got Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal on steam.  I love the game, just love it. This is definitely one of my favourite games to ever play. I also found out a while ago a new game which I think is called Particle Fleet is being developed by Knuckle Cracker and I really hope it makes its eventual way onto steam since it looks amazing. This game to me is a piece of true satisfaction and fun. This is a mix of two of my favourite types of games which are RTS and Tower Defense and it has combined those two perfectly in my opinion.\n\nTL;DR\nCreeper World 3: Arc Eternal is a great mix of RTS and Tower Defense games. It has a unique and constantly attacking foe known as the Creeper and is an astounding strategy game. If you are unsure whether to get this game or not check out Creeper World 3: Abraxis on kongregate to get an idea of the basics of the game and general gameplay.","March 2","true","35.6"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","27","29","0","1"

And I've only (shamefully) played less than 3 hours, BUT I'M QUALIFIED. This game is great :P I wanted my review to be my original thought about the game from looking at the screenshots, which was:\n\n"What are tho.. Ah, so.. The lines mo.. uh.. Wait, then those bubb, er.. And they.. ? What is tha.." :P\n\nIn short, this game is about the primal fear of water ruining your cool stuff. Imagine your kitchen. Its awesome. Except now you've decided to catalog your prize comic book collection, THE WHOLE THING. Its going to take a while. The table is\npiled so full that you've had to start making piles on the floor here and there. Suddenly, your child drops a full glass jug of apparently antique milk and it shatters!! *suspenseful music* Now, the antique milk hasn't splashed on your comic\nbooks.. YET!\n\nBut its spreading!! And, lucky you, besides collecting comic books you also design small functional mortars and cannons that fire small liquid-absorbing sponges, all supplied by intricate wiring relays that transport power from a central battery. For the sake of cohesion we'll say you developed the sponge cannons because of your mortifing phobia of dish cloths, also, so you can't just mop the liquid up.. *cough* If you're quick enough, you can set up an intricate web of relays linked to your tiny armada of sponge-launching war-machines aaaall along the kitchen floor in a milk-encircling radius and potentially combat the comic-ruining liquid menace before your precious copy of Jurrasic Park #1 is ruined.\n\nThat's what the game is about. Yep.\n\nIn all seriousness I think its pushing it to call this game a tower defense game.. I tend to reserve that title for games with MUCH less features and elements involved than this, particularly concerning tightly placed pathways. As stated elsewhere, if you have any doubts about purchasing, the first two games are on Kongregate free to play, and there is also a demo of this game on the devs website. But you don't need a demo. Did you need a demo when you decided air was good to breathe? Did you!? ;)\n\nAlso I wanted to mention that til this game showed up on Steam I had no idea it existed, so there is that :> I'm fresh as a daisy to this and can already smell the deep possibilities here and have barely touched the main campaign just yet, but I still hope the dev isn't fully done adding to the main game, especially since its life on Steam has just begun.. Now if I can just muster a little focus and make time for myself to play..","March 29, 2014","true","81.5"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","1"

It's vaguely reminicesent of tower defense titles, but with an absolutely monstrous, game-defining twist. The enemy is not units, but rather Creeper-goop that covers the map and damages or destroys your structures on contact. The game is to fight back, and then destroy the goop spigots-"emitters"- or complete other objectives. The structures and enemies are all very simple and direct in their purpose and utility. The game itself however is extremely various in difficulty based on the map itself-size, features, and the strength of the emitters. There are additional enemies in addition to the emitters but they are not in all maps.  The challenge of the game is all about defending yourself while you build your energy resources up before you push to destroy the emitters. Later, you can redo the maps to attempt to do so faster.\n\nThe game has a great custom map communtiy and a custom map generator after you finish the decently long and challenging campaign. Replayability is top notch.\n\nI've gotten more fun and more hours out of this than a shameful number of AAA titles. All things considered, absolutely amazing for an indie.\n\nI've had no issues with bugs, and the developer has been pretty good with support for those that do find them.\n\nThe only downside is there is no direct multiplayer of any sort. However, it really doesn't detract from all that you're already getting in this well-fleshed out title.\n\nNewbie Tips:\n-There is no such thing as too much energy\n-Stick to high ground when you can\n-Don't land near emitters\n-Don't build too many structures at once\n-Don't botch your startup\n-If you don't push, you can't win\n","March 28, 2014","true","285.3"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

I am hooked. Although the videos of the game make it look complicated and mask its true nature, I can assure the reader that it feels like a proper tower defence game. I am a big fan of the StarCraft "turret defence" games of old, and I'm particularly enamoured with TD games which allow you to maze. This game may not involve mazing, but you can freely place buildings and "towers" anywhere you deem fit. Do not feel dismayed by the lack of monsters and lack of paths. The "creeper" (which is the enemy) is a creative way of presenting said enemy. It is much too easy to think of it as StarCraft zerg creep to be honest, and needless to say it is not nice stuff. I feel that this game has been lovingly crafted, and I'm looking forward to the replayability that other reviewers have mentioned.\n\nGameplayYour objective is to defeat the creeper on each world. You do this by building up an energy grid and using that energy to build and maintain various weapons (akin to the traditional TD tower). These weapons can move to a new location as you push the creeper further back, and they can be upgraded at the forge.\n\nControlsYou use the keyboard and the mouse. All of the buildings, and many actions are linked to hotkeys, and those hotkeys can be rebound. Unfortunately the build menu does not tell you the hotkey when you hover, so you must go into the key bindings menu to discover what the hotkeys are in the first place. However, once you've learned them they are easy to get along with.\n\nStorylineThere is a plot in the Arc Eternal galaxy. It is fairly basic, and mostly explains the existence of the creeper. I didn't know what precisely was going to happen, but I certainly had a general idea of what direction the plot was going in. But this isn't the sort of game you play for the plot after all.\n\nSoundThe music is fun, it's energetic. However it is very repetitive. If I play this in the evening, I go to bed with the music stuck in my head.\n\nGraphicsThe graphics are pleasant and functional. Things seem a tad fuzzy if you zoom in really close, but I personally like to have an overall view of the map and so I don't zoom in close. Otherwise, despite all the layers upon layers of creeper, the game runs quite well for me and is not laggy.\n\nPros+ non-traditional tower defence\n+ free placement and movement of "towers"\n+ can rebind hotkeys\n+ default hotkeys make sense once learned\n+ make your own maps and play others' maps (great replayability)\n+ wide range of difficulty level (depending on map)\n+ first levels of campaign form a tutorial on how to play\nCons- music is repetitive\n- hotkeys are not immediately obvious\n\nHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you. It’s my hope to make the reviews that I do take the time to write up, as helpful as they possibly can be.\n\nRothana's Steam Review ArchiveFor those that are interested in seeing more of my reviews, I have set up an archive of them at an external website. I don't earn anything off of this at all, it's just a little side project that I add to when I can. Steam won't let me create a direct link though, so you'll need to make your own way to the URL I describe now: rothana dot weebly dot com\n\nFootnotes\n* Any prices that I mention are in CDN because that is what I see.

Have some turrets to keep Creepers at bay. Advance to their Emitter and destroy it with Nullifier(its range is short and takes time to activate, be sure to deal with creepers first).\nIt contains more than thousands of official levels, short maps are finishable within 3 minutes or so, and some epic maps would take 2 or more hours.\nThere's even a leaderboard competes for "time taken to beat the level", and some people seem to be really good at finding clever tactics or optimize their moves.\n\nThe game has a built-in map editor and script editor, which allows you to make interesting maps once you know how. I'm hoping to see good levels to play.\n\n12/10, One of the best RTS I played in all the time. I played all the 3 series of Creeper World, and love it best.\n\n--------------------------------\n液体状の敵「クリーパー」と戦うRTS。緑色の爆発する皆のアイドルではない。\n\nゲームプレイは比較的シンプル。「コレクター」を建ててエネルギー供給とネットワークを作り上げ、各種砲台でクリーパーと戦う。どんどん前線を押し進めてクリーパーの発生源である「エミッター」を破壊する(ただし破壊できる「ヌリファイアー」は建設に時間がかかる上に脆いので、発動までちゃんと守ること)。\nマップは公式で用意されたものだけでも数千以上あり、３分程度で終わる小型マップから数時間かけて攻略する難易度や規模のマップまでバラエティは豊富。\nクリア時間を競うリーダーボードもあり、上位のスコアの異常な速さは戦略の自由さと効率化の重要性を語っている(チートの線も否めないレベルってのもあるが)。\n\nあとマップ/スクリプトエディタも同梱で、作られたマップを公開、他者のマップをプレイして評価できる機能もある。これからのコミュニティの動きに期待できる。\n\n個人的点数は12/10。「最高のRTS」と聞かれたら挙げられそうなレベル。３作ともプレイ済みだが、３を一番薦めたい。","March 27, 2014","true","393.5"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","7"

I guess this is like a horde defense game, where you've got to keep a perimiter up?"\n\nSo I bought it. At first, It seemed like a lot to take in with very basic game mechanics, but once you've unlocked your full arsenal the maps become very challenging and innovative. I've sunk a lot of hours into it by this point, although I still haven't finished the campaign yet.\n\nI've got a short attentionspan, my favorite game on steam has less than 100 hours on it, to be honest.

I have a few top 10 high scores (look for Seika), I've completed the story, and whole heck of a lot of missions in Tormented Space area (hard mode), so I have quite a bit of familiarity with the game.\n\nPros:\n-A unique take on strategy that generally emphasizes resource and space management more than managing unit tactics, and the enemy is a rather literal tide rather than a more discreet set of units\n-Huge array of playable content, with a wide variety of maps.\n-Once you clear the main campaign, there are three main modes of pre-constructed maps. Prospector Zone has literally hundreds if not thousands of hours of content, Tormented Space exists for a good challenge, and Alpha Sector has some interesting and often difficult custom maps.\n\nCons:\n-There is little to no AI to speak of. Certain types of enemies are capable of either roaming around randomly, and another will target random sections of your grid, but otherwise, the enemy will follow a strict pattern every map. Except for speed running, there is little point to replaying a map.\n-Music will get repetitive.There is a mute button for a reason.\n-Once you clear the main campaign, there are three modes. Prospector Zone is where much of the game's content lies, but the (generally) lower difficulty and lack of custom scripting means that most of these maps will get boring and repetitive. Tormented Space is not always the best tested: Some maps will feel almost as easy as the tutorial, while others are quite literally impossible without cheating (there is a thread on the Knuckle Cracker Forum dedicated to which maps are super difficult, which are insanely difficult [often requiring odd tricks in order to even stand a chance], which are possibly impossible, and which are undeniably impossible). If I have any complaint about Alpha Sector, it is that many of these maps were designed by some of the best players to be at their level, so it can be hard to make progress through those missions.\n\nThe game can feel repetitive, particularly playing too much in too short a time, but the game has kept me hooked.

"functional"\nStory... "there" ;)\n\nmost people will see this and switch to the next game and thereby miss one of the greatest games available at the moment. There is so much depth and replayability in this game it's a shame that its presentation prevents it from reaching a larger audience. Having played computer games since the early days of the C64 I saw this game in a bundle somewhere and immediately knew I had to have it. Luckily for me it even was available in a Linux version and for virtually nothing - considering how much fun I had with this game since then I feel like I robbed the developer!\n\nNeedless to say that I recommend this game to anyone that has some affinity to tower defense or strategy games in general. Even if you are turned off by the graphics - give it a try! If you don't like it you wasted a (compared to the full price titles) tiny amount of money, but if you don't give it a try you might miss out on a gem that will give you many hours of enjoyment ;)\n","November 28, 2015","true","49.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

The main difference here though, is the enemy. Instead of tanks, humans or monsters, you have a lava like liquid, that slowly creeps its way to your base and tries to 'fill' the entire map.\n\nIt's called 'The Creeper'. I know, it sounds like the name of a cheap 60s horror movie, but it's not.\n\nAnyways, most of the time you'll build turrets, mortars, jet fighters and bombers to defend yourself from The Creeper. But usually that's not enough. You also have the option to 'terraform' the environment. That way you can either dig trenches, or, which is a lot more effective, raise the terrain to wall off your base.\n\nThe whole process is quite a lot of fun, especially when you unlock things like the Bertha, which is a giant cannon, or the Thor, which is a giant spaceship with multiple turrets that rains death from above.\n\nThe thing I like the most about Creeper World 3 is that you can play whatever way you like. This might be the slow and defensive way, or the fast and offensive way. This is quite important if you care about getting in the top 10 list of each map. These lists are primarily sorted by how much time it took you to complete the map, though to be honest, you'll have a hard time beating the best times, since they're usually around 20 to 30 seconds for each map. This is especially frustrating because I doubt those times are legit most of the time.\n\nAll in all though, Creeper World 3 features a huge amount of content, which is good if you like getting your money worth. It's also bad if you want to 100% this game, because judging by the amount of levels, it might take you hundreds of hours to do so.\n\nThere's also the fact that you can make your own maps, and play other players maps right inside the game. This gives Creper World 3 almost infinitive content, though some player created levels might be too easy, or even impossible to beat.\n\nConclusion: Amazing game with an enormous amount of re-playability, easily worth the full price if you're a fan of tower-defense/RTS type of games.","March 11, 2015","true","50.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Like others that I have read, I played the first 2, including the extra missions, all on Kongregate and eagerly awaited this third installment. I'm so glad to see it here on steam as the Dev can finally make a decent buck from his amazing efforts!\n\nWhat makes Creeperworld games so unique amongst other tower defence games is the energy currency system. Unlike other games that require you to save your resources, research, etc etc until you can build what you want, you have the ability to build straight away and as many of each structure as you like. The danger lies that the energy required to build, is the same energy required to fire weapons. So if you exhaust too much energy into building, you will surely die! This is balanced by the fact that the more "collectors" you spread across the map, the more energy you have, so there is always an incentive to keep building!\n\nAlthough not as graphically amazing as some TD such as Kingdom rush, Giants and Dwarves, etc or even the older Dune 3D, Starcraft, etc, etc it makes up for it in fantastic TD gameplay. The second installment of the series seemed to push for better graphics, though this actually seemed to tear away slightly from the charm of Creeperworld and I am personally glad to see an this version return a bit truer to its roots... With one great advantage... NULLIFIERS!! You can explode those nasty emitters. Something that you dreamed heavily about in the first game.\n\nThere are a bunch of new features in this third game all which so far (I know it's still early for me) are very welcome imrovements. One of the best improvements has to be the TERP that literraly allows you to redraw the level!! No space for that turret... No problem, I'll just terraform some extra land in there :) It's a low price for a game that will guarantee you hours and hours of addicting gaming.","March 30, 2014","true","40.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Your task: to liberate planets from the Creeper, which is a living liquid substance that had flooded and destroyed civilizations for millions of years. The story mode campaign is pretty much an extended tutorial that teaches you about all of the gear and units that you will acquire along the way. Once you have gotten so far into the story mode, you can unlock access to other Zones, which is where the game truly opens up.\n\nThese Zones have tons of star systems, each with their own collection of planets. Basically, you are free to explore hundreds (if not thousands) of levels of Creeper-fighting goodness. There is also a Map Editor mode in which you can create your own maps to upload to the community. You can also download maps that others have created, and rate them.

Unless you played the flash versions- then It's just more of the same, in an extremely good way. Beyond Creeper World's flash-era graphics, midi-era music, and long dialogues of exposition that seem to go on for ages, is a complex fun game that is more than your average tower defense.\n\nI feel like it would almost be putting Creeper World to shame by simply just calling it a tower defense. It's more like it's own unique style of RTS, pitting you against the mysterious force simply called "The Creeper" (aka water) that is constantly spreading at an alarming rate. Your goal varies from mission to mission, either a simple one such as "Get from point A to point B, destroying everything in your way" to "activate these 6 thingies, go over here and kill this, and then do a loop formation with your towers and then go...." etc etc. The game varies it's missions very well, making every planet seem like a distinct new world with it's own gimmick rather than just something thrown in a level generator. The towers are extremely situational, and I actually like this more- there's no "Jack of all trades" tower, forcing you to vary your strategy depending on what is happening in front of you.\n\nThis all sounds very complex, and possibly at the later levels it is. But as of writing, I have not completed the first sector as I am taking my time enjoying each level, and it is quite managable. I have not tried the extra features that seem very interesting such as DMD, Colonial Space, and Tormented Space, simply because I do not want to spoil the towers for myself- but these seem all like extremely cool features to add replayability to the already large campaign. DMD Allows you to name a randomly generated map after beating it, allowing other players to play and rate the map and name for themselves. Colonial Space is a sector of space only containing user generated maps, and Tormented Space is full of hard bonus missions.\n\nCreeper World 3: Arc Eternal is a beautiful game so far. It's mediocre graphics might not seem like it's worth 15 dollars at first glance, but this is much, much bigger than one might expect. If you like the base game, there is infinite replayability here with much more towers and many more planets to explore.","April 3, 2014","true","29.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I loved it. Now it's featured on Steam, and that was worth me buying the game again.. :V\n\nEssentially, Creeper World 3 is a simple, yet very addicting RTS game. Your task: to liberate planets from the Creeper, which is a living liquid substance that had flooded and destroyed civilizations for millions of years. The story mode campaign is pretty much an extended tutorial that teaches you about all of the gear and units that you will acquire along the way. Once you have gotten so far into the story mode, you can unlock access to other Zones, which is where the game truly opens up.\n\nThese Zones have tons of star systems, each with their own collection of planets. Basically, you are free to explore hundreds (if not thousands) of levels of Creeper-fighting goodness. There is also a Map Editor mode in which you can create your own maps to upload to the community. You can also download maps that others have created, and rate them. If all of that still isn't enough, there is a "Dial Map" service, which is a seed-based random map generator. So many potential battlefields..\n\nSo, yeah. Great game.

I liked the first better than the second, so when the third returned to the same style of gameplay, yet improved, buying it was a no-brainer.\nI have played many hours on number 3 before it gor released on steam, and more after.\n\nMost levels consist of establishing a beach head / base then beating back the unrelenting flow of creeper. When you reach their spawners, you can destroy them. When the last is gone, you win the map. Other levels have a master spawner that when killed destroys the others. Do you head straight for this one, or soften up the resistance first? The choice is yours.\nYour main recource, energy, is often the most deciding factor.\n\nPro's:\n- Nice long story arc.\n- Endless ways to complete levels.\n- Replayability to beat your previous best time.\n- Level editor.\n- Big community of custom levels.\n- A ton of levels ship with it outside of the story arc.\n- Programmable units (for custom levels).\n\nCon's:\n- Easy levels can get repetetive ("Just mopping up")\n- Some of the smaler maps are insanely hard (could also be a Pro rather that a Con... ;-) )\n\nGraphics / sound:\nThe game has simplistic graphics which is nice to look at, and more importantly, not so dazzling and cluttered as to confuse you. The soundtrack is good for the first few hours, but wheres a bit thin as the hours rack up. It can be muted in favour of what ever you like.\n\n\nI give this game 10 / 10 , It is one of the few games I keep returning to for another couple of maps.\n\n(PS!

Like others that I have read, I played the first 2, including the extra missions, all on Kongregate and eagerly awaited this third installment. I'm so glad to see it here on steam as the Dev can finally make a decent buck from his amazing efforts!\n\nWhat makes Creeperworld games so unique amongst other tower defence games is the energy currency system. Unlike other games that require you to save your resources, research, etc etc until you can build what you want, you have the ability to build straight away and as many of each structure as you like. The danger lies that the energy required to build, is the same energy required to fire weapons. So if you exhaust too much energy into building, you will surely die! This is balanced by the fact that the more "collectors" you spread across the map, the more energy you have, so there is always an incentive to keep building!\n\nAlthough not as graphically amazing as some TD such as Kingdom rush, Giants and Dwarves, etc or even the older Dune 3D, Starcraft, etc, etc it makes up for it in fantastic TD gameplay. The second installment of the series seemed to push for better graphics, though this actually seemed to tear away slightly from the charm of Creeperworld and I am personally glad to see an this version return a bit truer to its roots... With one great advantage... NULLIFIERS!! You can explode those nasty emitters. Something that you dreamed heavily about in the first game.\n\nThere are a bunch of new features in this third game all which so far (I know it's still early for me) are very welcome imrovements. One of the best improvements has to be the TERP that literraly allows you to redraw the level!! No space for that turret... No problem, I'll just terraform some extra land in there :) It's a low price for a game that will guarantee you hours and hours of addicting gaming.","March 30, 2014","true","40.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's quite satisfying to take back ground from the creeper, and when one word is safe, jump right into the next. One more level. I don't think I've played the other Creeper World games, but it feels like after years of making them they've got a pretty good handle on what makes a Creeper World game work in that regard.\n\nI've just finished the main Arc Eternal campaign, after 27 hours. (I play defensively and pause a lot. Your mileage may vary.) The campaign is pretty good at making each level just a little different, providing some new element of challenge and giving you a new ability to use. Some levels are more different than others.\n\nThe game's weakest moments, I think, are the maps that become simply an ocean of creeper. Any distinctive features of the terrain are all but lost under the sea, as you slowly entrench and advance. Maybe more aggressive tactics could prevent ending up in that situation, but since I wasn't actually losing those battles, I didn't give up and try different techniques. Then came along a different map that makes things interesting again.\n\nThis isn't the sort of game you play for the story. Yet there is a story, told in bits of dialog at the beginning and ending of levels, which shows some significant thought has gone into the lore of the Creeper. I might have appreciated it more if I was familiar with the other games, but it provides some interesting atmosphere.\n\nI can't comment on the other content outside the main campaign, but there seems to be a lot of it, with a strong focus on giving the community powerful tools to make more.\n\nI played this on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04). Everything ran great there; the only hitch I found is that after switching out of the window with Alt-Tab, I had to hit Alt again after returning to the game to get the keyboard input recognized correctly.\n\nTo sum up: Surely not everyone likes this style of game. But if you're interested in this sort of thing (which you likely are, if you're looking into the reviews), I recommend it without reservation. It's an excellent implementation of the idea.\n\nAnd also very good if you want to forget to eat or sleep.","June 25, 2014","true","52.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaraKalat/recommended/280220/","MaraKalat","Mara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaraKalat/","1228 products in account","Creeper World is technically a tower defence game, but unlike any other you've played before.\n\nIn a normal tower defence game (and even abnormal awesome ones like Defender's Quest) you'll have enemies coming towards a point or object you're defending and you're tasked with fending them off by placing towers either along a pre-defined path or by creating that path using walls or the towers themselves (this is known as 'mazing').\nIn Creeper World there is only one enemy, the Creeper. The Creeper is a fluid of alien origin and malicious intent, it absorbs and destroys anything constructed it touches. This changes the entire dynamic and feel of the game.\n\nThe goal (in most levels) is to activate totems that are strewn about the (bird's eye perspective 2D) map without having your base be destroyed by creeper. Creeper flows in continuously from spawn points and you build out a network of structures from your command ship to fend off the creeper (or even destroy its spawn points). The buildings are either combat focused (the traditional tower defence type towers) or utilitarian.\nBecause the resource system is quite different from a regular tower defence game as well (and is surprisingly similar to Supreme Commander / Total Annihilation instead), you have 'Energy' which is used to build structures, arm your towers and charge up totems. Energy is stored in your command ship and then flows along the nodes formed by the buildings you created, like a spider web that slowly grows outward (and not unlike the creeper that slowly washes over the map).\n\nA simple level progression would be to land your command ship at a strategically good location (high ground, remember that your enemy is basically a liquid so it'll flow into the low spaces first), start building collectors (buildings that gather energy from their direct surroundings) and laser towers to protect the collectors which you slowly move up with the front as the collector field grows in size (all offensive towers can be moved across the map whenever you want).\n\nOf course things get far more complicated later on, with the addition of new towers including mortars, bombers and snipers. New enemies like a creeper-formed network that will always transmit the creeper even if it's uphill, building-disabling enemies living on this network and even aerial creeper that will occasionally spawn from specific enemy buildings and head for your base.\n\nAll these things (and a lot more) are slowly introduced over the course of an excellent 30 or so campaign that even has a pretty engaging storyline (the game is set thousands of years after Creeper World 1 and 2, so you don't need to know all that much from them to get the gist of things. Unfortunately they were never released on Steam. For a sample of the gameplay from Creeper World 1 and 2 (and even 3, in case you want to try it out) there are in-browser options available here[www.kongregate.com]).\n\nThere is one mission right at the end of one of the two branches of the game's plot that is very different from the others though, and not in a good way. Unlike pretty much the rest of the game it has a time limit, and a harsh one at that. In the rest of the game (especially within the campaign) it's pretty hard to lose as long as you take things slow and don't over-extend yourself. This one mission completely messes that up and asks you to rush in and beat the clock. It's not a bad concept I guess, but terribly executed and I ended up downloading an in-mission savegame in order to bypass it because I just couldn't beat it.\n\nOther than that single (but major) gripe there is nothing but praise for this game. The campaign mode (which will last you a good long while) is only the tip of ice berg, as there are thousands upon thousands of additional levels that you will need a lifetime to complete. These range from fun levels the beta testers came up with, to nasty challenge levels the creator put in, to a whole universe of bonus levels, to procedurally generated levels. There is also an in-game level editor, complete with a way to directly share them with others and play their levels and tools to change anything in the game.\n\nGo give the game's free version a shot, and if the gameplay at all grabs you this is an excellent value purchase. Just remember that there's one super annoying mission in the campaign mode.","January 9, 2015","true","53.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

The extra content is just icing on the cake and almost assures return visits. In terms of whether or not it is suitable for kids, I’d have to go on record and simply say, “yes”.  There is no blood/gore and as an added bonus, it promotes critical thinking in that you’re forced to tackle maps in a systematic way.  Coming at the creeper from one side may not work, for example, but establishing a foothold elsewhere might be what you need to advance.  In a sense, this game is not only a real-time strategy/tower defense hybrid, but it’s also part-puzzle and will certainly make you think.  This combination is great for kids and adults alike, in my opinion.  All in all, “Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal” is a brilliant addition to an already fantastic series.  While this game is without a doubt a keeper, there’s a free demo on the official website (link below) should you wish to try before you buy."\n\nFull Review: http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/creeper-world-3-arc-eternal/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krR7JDezpMs\n\n","April 16, 2014","true","7.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's basic yet complex appearance may overwhelm those new to the genre, but Knuckle Cracker did a good job on slowly pacing the user into the concepts around Creeper World 3.\n\nThe graphics of Creeper World 3 aren't anything extraordinary but they are pretty solid. The terrain is in a variety of colors and the illusion of layers is clearly there. The various tools and weapons stand out from the terrain and are simple to realize through the variation in shape and color. While everything looks basic throughout the game, the graphics are crisp and clear - and that's good enough for a tower defense game.\n\nThe core gameplay of Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal is one that is new to me. While I have played other games in the same sort of genre, Creeper World 3 is unique in the sense that it's attempting to fuse both Tower Defense and Strategy-Simulation. While the majority of tower defense's have you place your weapons on a certain path as enemies start to come at you on a predictable path - Creeper World 3 is adds a refreshing twist. Your enemy is the creeper. The creeper spreads outward in all directions, covering the terrain and destroying everything in it's path. It is your job to use the weapons at your disposal to take out the source of the creeper - being the emmiters. While it may not sound that hard, which it really isn't at first; the difficulty begins to ramp up. It will be very challenging for newcomers - including me at times, but I never really felt that the game was cheating. I also realized what mistakes I made if I were to fail. Throughout the game, you will play a variety of maps with the inclusion of the story. The story arc is the weakest point about this game, it's very forgettable and did nothing to increase the immersion or gameplay. It's a good effort nonetheless. The mouse controls are also great - with the ability to pause the game, plan you moves and move your units around where you please. Overall, the core mechanics of Creeper World 3 is great and will be something for all games in the similar genre to beat.\n\nThe audio is good for a game like this. In all honestly, what can you expect. The music is fine with the occasion of it being repetitive. I found myself turning off the music at various times. The sound effects are pretty simple. Nothing special here.\n\nCreeper World 3's greatest strength is it's value. Like Skyrim, Portal 2 and Torchlight 2 before them, the sheer amount of user content is mind-blowing. At a cheap price of $15, it's pretty hard to not pick this one up if you are a fan of the genre. There are an abundance of maps, both pre-made and user-made all varying in difficulty. It's also good to note that some maps have been known as unbeatable. A random map generator is also here as well as an in-game editor to create your own maps for others to try. Creeper World 3 also has over 130 achievements for those who are into them.\n\nIn conclusion, Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal was one of the more surprising buys for me. I didn't think I would enjoy the game this much. It is something I will continue to play for years to come.\n\nGRAPHICS: 8.0/10\nGAMEPLAY: 9.5/10\nSTORY: 5.0/10\nAUDIO: 7.0/10\nCONTROLS: 9.0/10\nVALUE: 10/10\n\nOVERALL: 8.1/10\n\n+Refereshing take on genre\n+Challenging yet Fun\n+Solid Controls\n+Addictive\n+Great Variety in Maps and Units\n+Overwhelming amount of content\n+130+ Achievements\n+Inexpensive\n\n+/- Some Unbeatable Maps\n\n-Weak Story\n-Repetitive Music\n-Can sometimes be a grind","July 3, 2014","true","17.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The story I found to be equally enjoyable, so much so that I found myself making sure to play through every planet of a given sector in a single session just so I could move on to the next and hear more of the narrative.

It's was the first time I ever paid an indie dev directly for a game.   After losing my serial key, and resorting to pirating, and griefing the dev on his personal forum about how stupid serial keys are, I swore I wouldn't him pay again until I could buy it from a proper distribution service.  Of course I wasn't going to not play CWII, so I pirated just, just like I warned him.  Basically, I've given this dev a lot crap.  At no point, however, have I ever changed my belief that Creeper World is, definitively, the most creative, dynamic, and all around best tower defense game on the market.\n\nUnlike most wave based tower defense games, the eponymous creeper, somewhat akin to the nothing in Neverending Story, literally represents a tide of battle.  You find yourself struggling to mount a last ditch effort of defense in every map, desparate to get your defenses into place before it washes over you.  As you struggle to build up your (de/off)ense, the waves is getting ever higher, denser, and harder to push back.  Then there's that moment;  your towers start pushing back, you inch them forward and add some more.  The creeper starts to wane.  You close in for the kill.  You have conquered insanity.  It was a close call.\n\nCWII was a unique and addictive game in it's own right, bringing plenty of brilliance to the table, and a completely different experience.  Played from a side view, with a variety of new units and resources, it's very much the Zelda II of the series.  I strongly encourage you to play them both, and I hope he brings them to Steam; I will buy them in an instant.\n\nCreeper World III absolutely lives up to the legacy of brilliance.  Not only does it merge all of the extended unit and resources from the second game into the playstyle of the first,  It refines and expands on the concepts to offer a diversity of experience I simply wasn't prepared for.   I kind of expected more of the same, and what I got instead was my mind blown.\n\nEvery map is a righteous experience.  The amount of content is mindblowing.  It's the best tower defense game on the market.    Pay this dev, he deserves it.\n\n","February 18, 2015","true","25.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Do you appreciate the magnificent sprawl of your towers? Does the average TGD leave you feeling like all you do is sit back and wait for the enemies to make their move?

This game changes the Tower Defense rules so much that it is debatable if the term "Tower Defense" should even apply.\n\nThis is definitely one of the most addictive games I've played in a while. I highly recommend it.\n\nOn the downside, the graphics are rather poor (but about as good as can be for the simple top-down view).

I bought this game because its cross-genre TD/RTS looked nice, and because of the overwhelming horde of good reviews.  I'm happy to add my own to the mix.  There's not a lot I can say that the video doesn't cover, except that it controls real well and the challenge is an appropriate level.  Currently my favorite single player game in my library.  I'm about fifteen hours in, and there's at least another ten left for me.  Apparently it's kind of like Populous, with hordes of randomly generated worlds to play on.  Looking forwards to it.\n\nThis game reminds me somewhat of Immortal Defense.  While the gameplay is entirely different (it bends "Tower Defense" in the opposite direction), if you're the kind of person who gave that a try, you should probably try this as well and vice versa.\n\nThere's one keyboard-throwingly hard mission late in the story, but it doesn't end as soon as you might think.

The creeper isn't smart, it doesn't think, and it doesn't even have anything in the way of AI. What it has instead, is a pleasingly viscous fluid simulation. It flows downhill, it pools in low areas, and it can't cross high terrain without building up behind it and overflowing it like a dam. This is the key to the game. Work out where the creeper will flow, and divert or destroy it to survive and achieve your objectives.\n\nThe game is one of thoughtful management. Rarely is there urgency, except during scripted missions, or if you seriously mess up and end up watching a purple tidal wave swamp your low-lying energy collectors. That's okay! The challenge is one of incremental advancement and the satisfying conquest of areas that were drowned under a layer of creeper 8 stacks high.\n\nI'm a little concerned with balance issues (there is one early-acquired unit which seems overpowered, especially in groups) but I'm content to tend my garden of creeper without abusing it, which is an unusual state of affairs.","April 1, 2014","true","22.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is the first game I've bought in a long time at full price,  and it's worth every penny.\n\nCreeper World 3 is a pausable RTS-type game with aspects of tower defense at its core, combined with a physics/fluid dynamics twist. The game is very well done, challenging and packed with a number of game modes, along with a powerful integrated editor. It's not ridiculously complicated with dozens of units or a mad clickfest where you need millisecond reaction times to survive -- those games are not really my style, but Creeper World 3 is very satisfying. It can get hectic, but there's always time to pause and breathe.\n\nTerrain (including terraforming), energy networks and advancing your weaponry all play huge roles, and you will definitely be pondering strategies on every map. This is not a puzzler, there's not a single "right way" to win each map; given enough time, often times even poor strategies can grind out wins. That translates to a lot of flexibility and support for different playstyles and setups.\n\nAs the title suggests, this is the third entry in the series, so there's a level of polish and streamlining over the previous titles. There are a huge number of community-created maps, variable-driven procedurally generated maps, and advanced scripting options available in the editor to create a large variety of scenarios beyond just basic maps. You could basically play this game for the rest of your life and always see new content. Steam cloud, achievements and online leaderboards round it all out.\n\nTry the free demo at the developer's site to see if it hooks you like it did me: http://knucklecracker.com/common/demo.php","June 4, 2014","true","46.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Reminiscent of Total Annihilation (intentionally so, given the inclusion of the signature bertha cannon) and the under appreciated gem perimeter.\n\n\nThere is a great amount of value here for a game of this type. Each level in the campaign introduces a new unit or a new mechanic or just has some kind of unique property to make it interesting which is really the key to any decent RTS campaign. After you 'finish' the main story there is a bounty of user designed maps, wacky beta tester maps and 2 'sectors' of conventional maps with a specific goal in mind, not to mention the ability to design your own maps. Not only is the replay potential limitless it's also really good content in its own right, some of the use made maps are really fun and if you beat it in the fastest time you get to 'claim' it as your own.\n\nIf you're into oldschool RTS like red alert 2, starcraft or the aforementioned TA this the ultimate indie game, you wont get a better experience for your money.  I honestly can't believe this was developped by one guy given the amount of content squeezed in and the elegance of the design.","October 26, 2014","true","53.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There were many different versions available freely there. Recently, I decided to purchase the third installment to see how it was.\n\nThere is much to love about this game. The game follows more or less the same rules throughout, but the final two story missions are definite game changers. I've seen many complain about losing on the second to last mission due to time constraints - I myself lost the first time around, but with a little advice I figured out how to beat it. The consistency of the gameplay can make things a little drab if you play too much, but if you enjoy one level, you're likely to enjoy a whole lot more - and there are a whole lot more. There's an practically endless array of levels once you beat most of the story. You can binge play or play a game every once in a while - either way, it will take you a long time to run out of official maps, and you'll never run out of custom ones. The game isn't all too challenging if you remember to pause frequently and keep tabs on the Creeper and your resources, but there are more difficult levels available if that's what you're looking for. The graphics are solid - nothing incredible, but well-done nonetheless.","November 8, 2014","true","32.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was profundly impressed by the concept, fluid defense! I got quite hooked for a while, and then there came the following games and expantions, i often wonder where did this guy get all those great ideas for map creation.\n\nThen, a few days back, i saw this on steam, i didnt even saw the presentation, went straight into "take my money" mode. Now im scared, this game is HUGE, many new things have been implemented and a wide array of old stuff is in the game, for those new to creeper world, my advice is: have patience. The game has a long chain of "tutorial" missions (not a handholder, the missions are actually fun) Once you get into the game itself, things start getting interesting, and you really start strugglin with the choices you have, power management becomes a real issue, air raids become a fear, and the tides keep rising, ever flowing, overflowing!!!\n\nJust play the game guys, if you are not sure, look for the flash games of creeper world, if you like tower defense in general, this will revolutionize your perspective.","June 17, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've played CW2 before, so I didn't hesitate to buy this game as soon as I've noticed it.\n\nWhat is CW all about? It's an interesting strategy, where you don't fight against enemy units similar to yours, but massive amounts of creeping blue goo. So it feels a little bit like tower defence, but really innovative one.\n\nThe in-game economy system is quite simmilar to one from Supreme Commander (which I loved too!) and it's based more on flow of the resources than stockpiling them. This approach forces costant action, which is nice.\n\nSo, does concept still feels to You boring? Fear not, as so far every single map is quite diverse and suprises me with something new (I've completed about 30% of game, and CW2 which was quite brilliant too!). Your enemy sometimes spawns various units too, and the goo doesn't always act like it's expected to.\n\nThe game has its own plot, which is not that plain. There are no cosmic civilisations fighting against each other. There's no war, humanity lost against creeper long ago. You've been asleep for 5 billion years. All you can do is crawling through ruins of ceased race of humans, and try to make sense of what happened. Why do I even mention history in such simple game? Honestly, because at this point I am simply curious how will this story end.\n\nThe only 2 downsides I've noticed are:\n-crappy, plain graphics. I don't think it matters though, as this simpleness comes in one package with perfect gameplay and practical interface.\n-lack of multiplayer. Seriously, guys, I don't care, add it somehow!\n\nWhat do I say at the end? Mabye I'll describe my general feel about it. This game feels like the best flash game ever, but with large campagin and saving and stuff. Buy it. Do it. I don't think anyone would regret doing it, except if it makes him fail his exams or sth.","June 14, 2015","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I first found a flash game affixed on the engine used in Creeper World 1, Creeper World Training Simulation[www.kongregate.com] on Kongregate, and ever since then I had been searching vigeriously for more Creeper World flash games. Next up was another game created by the engine used for Creeper World 1, Creeper World: Evermore[www.kongregate.com]. Following up on that, I also discovered Creeper World: User Space[www.kongregate.com]. Shortly after, I finally found a flash game affixed to the engine Creeper World 2 was made from, Creeper World 2: Academy[www.kongregate.com]. I had a lot of fun messing around with the anti-creeper there. Eventually, I learned that there was a Creeper World 3 hidden somewhere on the internet, and I looked everywhere for it. Soon, after visiting Knuckle Cracker's website[knucklecracker.com], I learned that Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal had been Greenlit on STEAM. I rushed to get a STEAM Card from Gamestop, and IMMEDIATELY bought Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal without even a second thought. When I started playing, I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. Not for one second, not for my mom, not for my dad, not for my brother, not even to marvel at my chihuahua when he was rolling over in my room behind me, trying to get my attention. I could not stop for anyone. The story is amazingly well put together, and innovation and the quick thinking strategy it forces you to endorse while playing is absolutely indescribably amazing. I couldn't stop playing No matter how angry I got, or how far I progressed only to have the creeper destroy everything I have built and worked so hard for, I COULD NOT STOP PLAYING!! ....

A return to the top–down perspective of the original Creeper World, this game also incorporated many elements of the previous sequel, Creeper World 2 (which had a different perspective and significantly different mechanics).\n\nWhile I enjoyed this game very much, my biggest complaint is that the performance suffers when you have too many units built, which hampers my preferred turtle/juggernaut strategy. On some of the large maps, even playing at 4x speed the gameplay would slow to an interminable pace.

The creeper isn't smart, it doesn't think, and it doesn't even have anything in the way of AI. What it has instead, is a pleasingly viscous fluid simulation. It flows downhill, it pools in low areas, and it can't cross high terrain without building up behind it and overflowing it like a dam. This is the key to the game. Work out where the creeper will flow, and divert or destroy it to survive and achieve your objectives.\n\nThe game is one of thoughtful management. Rarely is there urgency, except during scripted missions, or if you seriously mess up and end up watching a purple tidal wave swamp your low-lying energy collectors. That's okay! The challenge is one of incremental advancement and the satisfying conquest of areas that were drowned under a layer of creeper 8 stacks high.\n\nI'm a little concerned with balance issues (there is one early-acquired unit which seems overpowered, especially in groups) but I'm content to tend my garden of creeper without abusing it, which is an unusual state of affairs.","April 1, 2014","true","22.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's was the first time I ever paid an indie dev directly for a game.   After losing my serial key, and resorting to pirating, and griefing the dev on his personal forum about how stupid serial keys are, I swore I wouldn't him pay again until I could buy it from a proper distribution service.  Of course I wasn't going to not play CWII, so I pirated just, just like I warned him.  Basically, I've given this dev a lot crap.  At no point, however, have I ever changed my belief that Creeper World is, definitively, the most creative, dynamic, and all around best tower defense game on the market.\n\nUnlike most wave based tower defense games, the eponymous creeper, somewhat akin to the nothing in Neverending Story, literally represents a tide of battle.  You find yourself struggling to mount a last ditch effort of defense in every map, desparate to get your defenses into place before it washes over you.  As you struggle to build up your (de/off)ense, the waves is getting ever higher, denser, and harder to push back.  Then there's that moment;  your towers start pushing back, you inch them forward and add some more.  The creeper starts to wane.  You close in for the kill.  You have conquered insanity.  It was a close call.\n\nCWII was a unique and addictive game in it's own right, bringing plenty of brilliance to the table, and a completely different experience.  Played from a side view, with a variety of new units and resources, it's very much the Zelda II of the series.  I strongly encourage you to play them both, and I hope he brings them to Steam; I will buy them in an instant.\n\nCreeper World III absolutely lives up to the legacy of brilliance.  Not only does it merge all of the extended unit and resources from the second game into the playstyle of the first,  It refines and expands on the concepts to offer a diversity of experience I simply wasn't prepared for.   I kind of expected more of the same, and what I got instead was my mind blown.\n\nEvery map is a righteous experience.  The amount of content is mindblowing.  It's the best tower defense game on the market.    Pay this dev, he deserves it.\n\n","February 18, 2015","true","25.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Truth be told, I thought this game was going to be some simple gimmick game, but the gameplay looked decent enough to try. Although the graphics aren't anything worthy of praise, it's an incredibly simple but effective demonstration of raw real time strategy gaming. The Campaign itself isn't too challenging, but beyond that there are tens and potentially even hundreds of missions which are playable beyond the Campaign, many of which are incredibly challenging in their own right. The economy system is incredibly similar to the likes of Supreme Commander. If you don't mind minimalistic graphics and love a good real time strategy that's really easy to pickup, but difficult to master, then Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal is the game for you.","June 23, 2015","true","37.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gtAngel/recommended/280220/","gtAngel","gtAngel♪","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gtAngel/","83 products in account","Creeper World is a tower defense with very unique gameplay and design. Unlike most tower defense games your enemy isn't a horde of monsters, but is instead a steadily expanding mass known as 'creeper'. Defeating the creeper isn't as simple as having strong towers - you have to know how to hold back the creeper while expanding your own area of influence, taking into account the the creeper will ooze in from multiple angles and will build up in areas of low elevation to eventually climb up onto higher ground.\n\nYour own building mechanics are quite interesting as well. Instead of having independent towers, you instead build a web-like network of resource gatherers, utility structures, and attacking towers. Managing this web can get quite tricky at times, because all resources must flow through a command center and take time to traverse the network. Done incorrectly you could end up building a tower but not being able to arm it in time to defend against the creeper.\n\nAlso, while the creeper acts as a steadily growing mass, the player often ends up mirroring the creeper in many ways. Collectors - the primary resource generator - are most effective when spread out, forcing the player to expand their area of influence if they want more resources to spend. There are also many resource deposits around the map which must be contested, forcing the player to expand their area of influence even more. Aiding this playstyle is the fact that attacking towers can be respositioned, allowing you to leapfrog towers to slowly but steadily push the creeper back.\n\nOverall the game is an excellent example of a unique twist on a genre and very polished gameplay. It's an extremely satisfying game to play and I highly recommend it to anyone who finds the concept interesting. Don't worry about not playing the previous games - they give more of the story, but this game is fully functional as a standalone experience.","June 25, 2015","true","37.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pixel art while low resolution can be hard to master, having the visuals of a game like FTL would make this game look incredible.\n\nGameplay tips:\nTerps can be toggled between shaping layers or the closest block\nSprayers can be set to "always on", I suggest flooding your base with AC and letting it overflow to expand your borders\nDon't be afraid to pause and plan with TAB or P\nSet up a few Berthas and aim them at spawn points, with enough you will slowly drain the map","November 30, 2015","true","33.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every building and weapon costs energy to build, and most cost energy to maintain, forcing you to constantly expand to new areas to build new collectors/reactors to beat creeper back by few tiles more until you can escape (CW1) or kill it for good (CW2/CW3)\n\nThat's it. But the way Creeper interacts with shape of the map means that there's a lot of strategy involved: where do you set up a defence? Can you cover the valley with collectors AND fortify it before creeper floods it? Do you go for tight grid of expensive but efficient and easily defensible reactors or for wide and redundant but hard to defend net of collectors? What combination of weapons will you use? How many blasters? Mortars? Sprayers? Maybe use Bombers, Strafers and Cargo planes to open another front on top of the hill instead of fighting uphill? How do you handle valley and mountain ranges?\n\nNot to mention player-made maps of all sorts, including puzzles, "play as creepers" and tricky maps with lots of unexpected scripting.\n\nBonus highlight of the game is CRPL = Creeper Reverse Polish Language, a built-in scripting language giving map creators total control, even roguelike maps can be made.\n\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend entire series, available from creator's page. Only latest instalment is on Steam.","February 4","true","295.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You build towers to limit the spread of "the creep", something that spread like goo over all areas of the map like the Flood in Halo, except smaller. Weapons can limit them, but the only way to stop them on a world is to destroy the creeper emitter on the world by building a nullifier near it. However, nothing can survive in the creep... thus, you need to build a network of nodes to power the turrets, push back the creep, and eventually reach the emitter and shut it down.\n\nAs you advance from world to world, system to system, creeps get... creepier. They get spore throwing towers (shoots a blob of creep anywhere on the map), but you get beam towers to defend against such. The defense "digitalis", which was supposed to destroy creep at the molecular level, had been subverted and now creates "pathways" to spread, but cannons and such can roll back such until you can destroy the digitalis emitter. Runner nodes generate small runners that can suicide, but you have "sniper" turrets against such. Then "glider" nodes with weapons defend against intruders near its paths.\n\nTo counter those, you get better turrets. Mortar (ignores terrain), sniper turrets (mentioned before) that goes after runners and such but limited to line of sight, beam turrets against incoming spores (some are launched up to 4 at a time), sprayer to spray "anti-creep" (AC), bombers to drop larger qty of AC, strafer to slow a valley of creep, Guppy transport to move AC, energy, or ore around maps that has disconnected islands, Big Bertha cannon (takes out a big chunk of creep), better control nodes (longer range) and much more.\n\nYour command module along with collectors and reactors generates the power to power all the turrets. The trick is find control terrain to limit the creep to a section of the map, then roll it back section by section, by controlling key terrain much like all RTS games, without running out of power.\n\nYou are some sort of warrior awakened after millenia of sleep, only to find desolation all over the galaxy, ruins everywhere, signs of combat and creep everywhere as well, shields and warp inhibitors did not save the worlds, but your strategy and deployment of units may. As you advance from world to world, star system to star system, your encounters gets worse and worse, enemies gets more and more complicated, but you get more and more toys to play with.\n\nWhile graphics are low-fi and 2D only it does not distract and in fact, keep the frame rate high and creep is sufficiently creepy enough. There are also visibility options to turn stuff on/off to help visualize the battle, with zoom. However, there is no edge scroll... You have to use WASD to scroll if you are zoomed in.\n\nIt is different enough from regular tower defense to give you a good challenge, but it does get a bit boring after a while, or frustrating, as energy management is crucial, and there is no manual. Read beginner's guide on Steam before getting started.\n\nVerdict: Try. It is a very unusual RTS.","January 8","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Except instead of fighting against creeps and monsters (which are also in the game but not the main element), you are up against a liquid type enemy which is a complety new experience. It goes off Creeper World 1 and adds CW2 elements and abit of new elements itself to create a great sequel. I reccomend getting 1 and 2 as well. They are an experince not worth missing.\n\nThe experience in this game is new and refreshing. Games can go from afew minutes to even a couple of hours depeding on the map you are on. Each map the creeper is different and so is the terrain. So you have to find a new way to approach it. It include many story missions as well as randomly generated and player designed missions which makes the replayablity of the game so high.\n\nThe game is great for competitve players as well as casual players. Players compete for the best score on a map and i end up replaying a single map many times in order to get a better score. Honestly this game is worth the buy due to its unique tower defence experience. If you are new to the genre and an expericed TD player i highly reccomend this game. It's a must buy.","March 30, 2014","true","117.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The gradual tech and story progression with each - sometimes long, sometimes difficult - mission, adapting to and overcoming the new challenge, is just very enjoyable for me.\n\nNow that I finished the campaign, though, I feel I have only scratched the game's surface. With all the user-created maps, and extra map packs the game provides, I am already returning for more challenges.\n\nA criticism I'm reading in the negative reviews is how the game is the same grind all over again. Building up basic macro and defenses, and then progressing with micro as you upgrade your tech. For a game where every map is different, leaving a wide array of viable strategies and tactics to the player, I find this a very bad point. The SupCom-esque resource system, the focus on map control and relentless assault make this game very interesting, and even the initial 'always repeated' steps come in a personal flavor and depend on the map.\n\nThe graphics may look abstract and weird in the screenshots, but they quickly make sense when playing the game. The terrain layers are also very consistent. And honestly, I found a salvo of Bertha shots' dispersed Creeper very satisfying to watch. There's few things like it.\n\nIf you're interested, watch some gameplay videos or just wait for a decent sale. I got it at -90% so sales do get decent! There's little room for disappointment at that price, and maybe it will cause you yourself to write a positive review in time.","July 29, 2015","true","21.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ilborghi/recommended/280220/","ilborghi","ilborghi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ilborghi/","346 products in account","A good game, but with issues in its "packaging".\n\nI knew the series from the previous Flash chapters. The developer did a good job adding enough elements to this episode to keep the gameplay interesting throughout the campaign.\nIt's an interesting strategy game, where you know how the enemy will behave from the start (since it follows fluid physics) and yet every map requires you to think about how to approach it with the land provided and the techs unlocked. The gameplay is solid, it is decently challenging for a first walkthrough (yet nothing a player with any experience in the genre will not be able to tackle) and offers a chance for speedrunning/score attack replays of existing maps. Apart from the campaign (which took me somewhere between 8 and 10 hours at a leisurly pace), the game has a couple extra modes with different objectives, for even more longevity.\n\nThe problems I have with the game are mostly outside of the gameplay itself. The game asks for a relatively high price tag for a series evolved from a Flash game, but does it add enough to make it reasonable? In my eyes, it doesn't.\nThe storyline is ridiculous, it pretty much revolves for the entire campaign around the idea of "I lost my memory, what's all of this?". You could skip every dialogue in the game and not miss anything relevant. The only campaign progression is the gradual introduction of more buildings and techs.\nWhich leads to the second point: after you unlock everything and you figure out which approach works best for you, most of the extra modes are more of the same. Which is good if you want to play more on different maps, but it lacks the tailored scenarios of the campaign. Still, it's good to come back from time to time for a map or two and have a large selection of unexplored locations.\nThe graphics haven't improved in a relevant way compared to the Flash chapters. The soundtrack is very limited and you will get bored of the few track really fast.\n\nAll things considered it's still a game I'd pick up, but at a sensible discount, since it's reasonably fun to play for a while but lacks the added value to justify the price point.","August 13, 2014","true","25.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Everything comes down to building networks of weapons, shields, and other devices to slowly push forward against the rising tide. Full map terraforming, a wide variety of weapons and upgrades, movable towers, artillery, shields, and aircraft are all tools at your disposal. The story campaign has a wide and clever variety of mission types and goals, and an interesting "big idea" sci-fi story line reminiscent of Arther C. Clarke is the icing on the cake here. The random mission generator, huge variety of additional non-story missions, and sizable community map selection ensure you'll never run out of new challenges. A generally slow pace, as well as full pause-and-issue functionality, ensures that you can play as methodically as you like. Fair warning, there is one timed mission in the campaign (Farbor), but after a replay or two you'll be able to beat the 35 minute timer without too much difficulty. Being smart is always vastly more important than being fast in this game.\n\nAny fan of strategy, especially logistics-heavy strategy, would do well to check this one out.

Although this game might seem quite 'samey' at first, there are thousands of levels to be played in various areas.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/recommended/280220/","raixel","raixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/","495 products in account","SUMMARY:\nA unique and interesting RTS/tower defense sci-figame. You use nodes to create webs which energy then passes through to power your weapons/defenses and beat back the ever-encroaching purple creeper "mist". Its addictive and you will have the temptation to go "one more level" everyime you think you're going to quit. The graphics and sound are adequate, but not great, But who plays these games for the graphics? If you are an RTS/TD fan, this game is defintely one to pick up even at full price. It's tiny bit pricy at full price for those who arent die-hard fans of RTS/TD games, but if you see it on sale, get it!\n\nMAIN:\nThis game is fascinating. Its a really unique RTS/tower defense, the style of which vaguely reminds me of the Zerg in the original Starcraft. But there are no barracks for units, no movable parts. No vespene gas.\n\nYou have awoken in space after a 5-billion(!?) year stasis sleep, to find that the Creeper has again rampaged around destroying humanity's galactic empire. Of course, you must stop them. Its kind of difficult to explain how this game works without seeing it, but I'll do my best:\n\nThe Creepers have emitters which slowly start filling the map with purple stuff. If this purple stuff touches one of your buildings it is destroyed. You need to destroy all the emitters to progress. Sometimes there are other objectives as well.\n\nSo you build a command center far away from the emitters. Then you start building nodes and weapons such as cannons. Each node creates lines to the nodes next to it, and power flows through these lines from the command center to your weapons/cannons as well as newly placed buildings to construct them. Cannons cant link to each other, but only to nodes and relay nodes. So you want to build as many nodes to create a web, then a front line of weapons to hold off the onslaught, slowly building more relay nodes and weapons as you manage to beat back the "purple mist".\n\nThe nodes also generate energy, which you need to power your cannons and build things quickly. Build too fast, and your energy goes out of balance, weakening the ammo resupply to your cannons and allowing the evil purple stuff to overrun them.\n\nThere are also specialty nodes, such as relays which speed up energy transmission to new nodes and weapons, reactors, which provide lots of energy, special weapons, and many others I havent seen yet.\n\nTheres a lot of strategy, figuring out the best place to put your nodes to create fast transmission of power as well as beat back the purple mist, but not overbuilding so you end up overrun.\n\nMissions are timed, although as of yet I havent seen any where you "must beat the mission in (x) amount of time", but I wouldnt be surprised if they were out there (I hate those types of missions...I'm naturally a careful player who tries to do/see everything in any game I play. I HATE being rushed.). The fun of being timed is a global leaderboard where you can see rankings of how fast people have beat the missions.\n\nThe graphics are nothing to write home about, just little representations of the terrain, units, your node web, claimed territories, ect. But who cares? The strategy is what matters here, and I'll take gameplay over graphics any day of the year.\n\nSound is the same as graphics. Its ok, but nothing spectacular. Lots of pew pew and booms.\n\nOverall, this is a unique and interesting game. There appear to be many many levels to play as well as a storyline. Its really fun, and if you see it on sale is a must buy for any RTS/tower defense fan.","June 29, 2014","true","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It also has some tower defense elements to it, but again, it's quite different from any "true" tower defense game.\n\nLike a TD, it's a game about fighting a relentless enemy that keeps coming at you along predictable paths.\n\nLike a regular RTS, you build structures to harvest resources, and your towers can move around (this is very important on many levels) once they're built.\n\nYour enemy is a liquid with no ability to react to your activities. It simply spreads from emitters and flows downhill, forming pools that eventually overflow and flood the map. There's no enemy AI worth mentioning. And it's still surprisingly challenging, because there's a lot of the stuff, and your resources can be quite limited. You'll have to make careful decisions about where to build something and when because running out of power at the wrong time can cause your entire line of defense to collapse in a real hurry.\n\nIt's a very simple concept, with only a few types of unit, a very straightforward upgrade system and extremely barebones presentation...and it adds up to a highly addictive game with surprising depth once you get into the tougher maps.\n\nAll in all, I can definitely recommend this.","July 31, 2014","true","97.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's actually real time strategy rather than tower defense -- much more dynamic and fun.\n\nThe creeper is the enemy; there are structures on the map which will produce waves of creeper, which are hazardous to your units. Some structures will launch creeper artillery into the middle of your infrastructure. You use weapons to defend yourself and push the creeper back. Towards that end, you must acquire and manage your resources. Your objective is to destroy enemy offensive structures and the score is determined by how fast you can do it.\n\nThe high variety of maps presents a unique challenge every time.

Level quality can vary a great deal, with some really clever ones, and some that are truly just boring, with little to warn you which will be which.\n\nEven so, if you enjoy this sort of challenge, you'll find you have a lot of quiet moments of personal accomplishment where you puzzle out some elaborate resource management or timing issue.  The game has a lot of depth, and even once you've polished off the campaign, there is loads more playtime to be had.\n\nOverall, good stuff.  If you enjoy strategic puzzles and resource management then this is an easy buy.","July 25, 2014","true","217.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

KnuckleCracker still knows how to impress.\n\nYou've watched the gameplay, you get the concept - you're fighting a blob; storyline irrelevent. Figure out where to land your HQ and lay out some power infrastructure. Get to the point you can build two power structures at once, build a few sets of two. Construct a laser and mortar, click "stop resupply" and when they're built - figure out which one you need first - click "disarm" and then "resupply" and then do the same for the second weapon. Construct a third weapon, your choice, I prefer mortars over lasers 4/1 so I'd make two mortars.\n\nThe trick with mortars and your power supply is, they recharge faster than they fire. So you can pinch off their supply, use it to construct and power other buildings, and stop them - then resupply the mortars more quickly than over-loading your entire power supply would. By playing "half-court" with the power supply, I have been able to greatly improve my speed. Some levels that I've thought were impossible, I've re-visited and been able to beat; some are still impossible.\n\nSome cheats must exist because of high scores. High scores mean nothing though. You play, you win and lose, you have fun, you get frustrated, you leave, you come back and figure out a new layout or move on. It's a good game. I play it often - I mute the music and watch TV on an adjacent screen though.

I really am missing some personality, some intelligent behavior, like f.e. in Ai War.\n\nDont get me wrong, its not a bad game.

There's a fluid mechanism that makes it possible for the slime to build up and spread out, which is kind of neat (e.g. if you're on top of a hill, the slime will take longer to reach you and it flows into cracks and valleys first).\n\nSo, the one player campaign begins nicely enough, you get introduced to units and game mechanics. The story is also interesting (and is mainly what kept me playing). However, it seems that on every mission there is always something new; a new unit or building you need to take into consideration that does one special thing which you need to take out some specific enemies. They're not exciting or add much to your strategy, except "to kill unit X you need unit Y". Which doesn't give you much choice of an attack strategy at all, except to build whatever is required to make it through the level.\n\nAnd this is where the game fails the most - every level is a grind. You quickly set up your defense perimeter, but once you manage that, it's slowly building up an attack force and inch by inch moving away enough slime to get to an "emitter", destroy that, and do the same for any other stuff you need to destroy. You know you'll make it, it just takes time and there aren't many surprises.\n\nSo, on top of not being very challenging or exciting except the first five minutes of every level, it takes between 45 minutes to over an hour to finish one. When you're finally done trudging through, you breathe out in relief - not satisfaction. Then you get annoyed because it has taken so damn long, and 90% of it was just waiting for things to happen.\n\nSo, to sum it up:\n\nYays:\n* Interesting campaign story\n* Fluid dynamics are nice\n\nNays:\n* Levels are a grind\n* Too specialized units make things more annoying than exciting\n* Tactics are more or less the same every level\n* Takes too long to finish a level\n* Only exciting first couple of minutes on every level, after that it's just routine","December 29, 2015","false","17.3"," 22 of 45 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","22","45","3","0"

Other units are useless and unused - well, again if they are not needed by map design.\nYou have to employ snipers on maps with "bugs", anti-air guns where you are being pressed by spores, and planes/berthas on maps made of "islands". But that does not change your strategy, it just adds a tiny mix of certain type of gun to the "build mortars and win".\nThe only mission i actually had to adjust over time was the last mission of the main story AGAINST Loki. But even then it was just a bigger mix in overwelmingly prevaling "mortar combat".\n\nSo after a certain time the game becomes dull and the only challenge are map conditions where you are forced to do something before you can "mortar them all".\nIt is a shame, really. The overall concept is very nice.\n\n\n---- SPOILER ALERT ----\n\nAnd i was able to win last mission as Emperor doing this:\nMove around not to get hit and destroy the right lower AA gun.\nPlace the ship outside the range of other guns.\nSet time to 4x (only needed to make things quicker.\nPress the mouse button that fires the gun (and leave it pressed whichever way you like), so the creep is constantly renewed below the gunshots.\n8Hrs later (2Hrs on 4x speed) - victory, the map was  completely flooded by the creep :)\n\nThe only thing interesting about it was to see how the creep and anticreep collide and how the "fluid physics" works in game.","November 1, 2015","false","25.9"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","18","37","0","3"

The approaching doom of the creeper goo gives you a survival feeling i haven’t seen many games be able to recreate.\n\nWhile i'm a firm advocate of "gameplay before graphics", i can’t help but feel that this game deserves better graphics, not to say that the gameplay is effected, but the gameplay is so nicely polished it would be great to see graphics that match the high level of gameplay, Its ovbious that the creator is probbly more comfortable with programming (I'm sorry if you're not!) which isnt nessisarily a bad thing because the gameplay makes up for it massivly, but the graphics in their current state are kind of plain and the looming doom of the creeper sludge or whatever it is, isn’t quite captured as well in its current opaque single colour state. Regardless I’ve been enjoying the hell out of the game\n\nLastly, i would love to see more types of items to defend with, aside from using the anticreeper goo turrets and the jets, i found the game mostly revolved around the standard turrets and mortars, with some specialty units thrown in that are only situational, they're fun but more variation would be nice. Also the block building thing is overpowered as hell, really needs some sorta finite resorce to stop you from just cheezing it and building a 10 high bridge all the way to the spawners, i'd like to see it cost more or be limited somehow because it makes defending way too easy, maybe combine it with the ore production so it costs a bit more, I’m a bit of a turtle style builder but this gives you way too much control.\n\nBut yeah buy this game!!\n","June 13, 2015","true","20.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The approaching doom of the creeper goo gives you a survival feeling i haven’t seen many games be able to recreate.\n\nWhile i'm a firm advocate of "gameplay before graphics", i can’t help but feel that this game deserves better graphics, not to say that the gameplay is effected, but the gameplay is so nicely polished it would be great to see graphics that match the high level of gameplay, Its ovbious that the creator is probbly more comfortable with programming (I'm sorry if you're not!) which isnt nessisarily a bad thing because the gameplay makes up for it massivly, but the graphics in their current state are kind of plain and the looming doom of the creeper sludge or whatever it is, isn’t quite captured as well in its current opaque single colour state. Regardless I’ve been enjoying the hell out of the game\n\nLastly, i would love to see more types of items to defend with, aside from using the anticreeper goo turrets and the jets, i found the game mostly revolved around the standard turrets and mortars, with some specialty units thrown in that are only situational, they're fun but more variation would be nice. Also the block building thing is overpowered as hell, really needs some sorta finite resorce to stop you from just cheezing it and building a 10 high bridge all the way to the spawners, i'd like to see it cost more or be limited somehow because it makes defending way too easy, maybe combine it with the ore production so it costs a bit more, I’m a bit of a turtle style builder but this gives you way too much control.\n\nBut yeah buy this game!!\n","June 13, 2015","true","20.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Got my money's worth but not much more than that.\n\nOne of the more innovative takes on the tower defense genre, but not without its flaws.\n\nThere are no waves, just the relentless Creeper that keeps flooding the levels at a more or less steady rate. Meanwhile, the player builds all manner of defenses and the infrastructure to support it. It becomes a tug-of-ware between how much creeper is created and the player's ability to destroy it. Due to this mechanic, the hard part is usually the beginning, the containment of the creeper. Once that's done, the player would begin building more and more weapons to turn the tide in his favor. It gets a bit redundant, but luckily the devs have spiced things up a little with creative level design.\n\nBut that's just one way of playing the game. The other is to rush everything in minutes and ignore most of the depth the game has to offer. The worst part is that the tactic for rushing is pretty much always the same.\n\nHaving spent hours defeating single levels with the first method, I feel kind of cheated. I like the base building aspect in games, because it's rewarding to see the tide turn in your favor.

While there is some innovation in Arc Eternal (as with all formulaic games like it), it's mostly the same as before, both a blessing and a curse.\n\nWhile the gameplay is fine, it's how it plays that I don't like.

It's a slow, slow game out there, and that's going to make it or break it for you. While others may relish in it, I can't.

It is certainly an interesting concept that works and there is alot of game to be had here, complete with online leaderboards to compete with friends/the world for best level-completion times. While I enjoyed my time in Creeper World 3, I don't think I will  ever get my full moneys worth of fun.\n\nThe goal is to build and power a multitude of units to combat the creep (akin to the creep in StarCraft). The main mechanic is based off of various geographic levels, or topography, where the creep gradually covers the entire surface of the playing map - or you fight it off and kill it at the source. That is the main enemy.\n\nPros:\n+Really fresh concept that works well\n+Tons of replayability and truckloads of units to build and strategies to master\n+Great value for the price - that is if you don't mind playing a single player RTS for hours on end\n+It is quite fun\n\nCons:\n-Leaderboards are not enough for me\n-Having a relatively non-mobile enemy for every map can get dull (sometimes the creep has projectiles, etc., but in the end it is pretty much all the same)\n-Interface needs worth, in example it would have been nice to have mouse-over hotkey help, etc.\n-Graphics feel dated\n\nI can understand why this is one of the top rated RTS games on Steam, but and the end of the day, I need a bit more out of an RTS for any kind of sticking power. I think the enemy needs more complexity.","October 6, 2015","false","5.0"," 7 of 25 people (28%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","28","7","25","3","5"

Fair warning: you will become addicted to it, and rack up 20 hours playing it in a  single week. I've played it over 10 hours in two *days*.\n\nThe trailer, pictures, and even description on CW3's store page fail to do the game justice. It's RTS only in that you can place and move units while the timer is running. It's TD only in that your units only fire while sitting still, and half of your units can't move once placed. Allow me to paint you a different picture of this game. The creeper is like water that bubbles up from the ground, and you can't touch the water...because you're a cat with a lot of really cool turrets. Each of your turrets does something different. Half of your turrets aren't offensive devices; they're used to set up the infrastructure of your base, collecting resources, etc. Your energy recharges continuously, but your base can output more energy than it collects, and will eventually reach equillibrium with your input. When you start to net energy income, do you build more energy collectors, or new weapons? Eventually, you can terraform the map at large energy output, but you don't need the terraformers on constantly. Want a turret at a different location to combat the creeper? Your offensive turrets can fly. to new locations, but if your infrastructure hasn't caught up to the front, their ammo stores will drain rapidly.\n\nEach map is essentially a series of multi-step problems that can be solved in a variety of ways, especially as you unlock more turrets. Early in the game, it's pretty obvious what tactics the map maker had in mind, promarily because you haven't yet uinlocked all of the turrets. But not even half-way through the initial campaign, you come to understand the myriad paths you can take to solve each particular step of a problem. Terraforming is a big part of this: because you can literally change the shape of the map, setting up infrastructure one way opens up different solutions down the road.\n\nThe two extremes of the spectrum of CW3 players are probably Speed Runners <----> Slow and Steady. I'm the latter right now, which is one of the reasons missions take me so long: I spend more than half the run-time with the timer paused. But you've got to be careful while paused: queue up too many turrets, and your production rapidly outpaces your income, slowing your entire system. The game doesn't punish you for being either kind of player--on most levels, your resources don't dwindle over time, so you could play a single map for hours in a trenchy-style of building one row of turrets just in front of your previous row. The game *does* punish you for not paying attention--being fast is definitely doable if your minimalistic solution has all of the right components.\n\nCW3 is a phenomenal example of the adage: gamers prefer good mechanics to good graphics. But don't let the 2D simplistic art scheme fool you. Not only are the mechanics solid, the performance stellar, but the interface is also straight-forward, and the controls seem pretty intuitive. Left-click to select, right-click-hold to move around the map. Zoom in/out with mouse wheel. Escape to un-select or exit out of a selection. The visuals and animations tell you what you need to know, and if something isn't working like you expected, it's pretty easy to figure out why.\n\nI wouldn't say it's a difficult game in the initial campaign, but it *is* intense regardless of your strategy. There appear to be scads of maps that the community has created that will test your skills, as will the Challenge section by the developers, *and* the custom-level editor is built right into the frakking game.\n\nGeez...I haven't even gotten to the Titans yet....  :}","January 1, 2015","true","240.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having played Creeper World and Creeper World 2, this follows the game design of the former. While the graphics may be on a lower end than that of normal games, it provides hours and hours of fantastic gameplay.\n\nFor newbies. game elements are introduced to you slowly through the storyline, all the way up to the boss map (hello Thor!). The storyline does build off CW1 and CW2, so you might be a bit lost in understanding any plot and twists. Recommendation to play the first two iterations first - they are both great games.\n\nThe game allows you to freely tab out (I'm looking at you Popcap) while remaining in play, and you are able to micromanage and rearrange your defenses when paused - a definite plus. You also get multiple save slots! The speed up buttons are also a wonderful addition - anyone that has played tower defenses will appreciate speed up buttons (1x, 2x, 3x and 4x).\n\nPlus point is that all your games are cloud saved on Steam - no more having to rebeat the entire storymap and more when you change a new computer or accidentally clear your files! The Alpha and Prospector sector are two such additions which will provide an eternity more of gameplay once you finish storymode. The maps are heavily varied, ranging from small maps to huge maps - all of which will require different strategies. It doesn't feel like you're merely doing the same thing over and over again. And if you ever finish the abovementioned sectors (has anyone?!), there are plenty more user-made levels for you to try out.\n\nAn average map generally ranges about 15 - 25 minutes to win. It's a great game to play in between other games for a short break or while waiting for queue times.\n\nFor only SGD15.00, easily worth every single cent. 10/10","January 5, 2015","true","40.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Really creative way of thinking strategically. There are sooo many maps to play, that you'll never get bored (if you enjoy the concept).

I really love the concept behind the game, and after playing hundreds of tower defense tyle games (they're my favorite type of flash game) I can say that this style is one of the most unique I've seen, allows for more creativity in your set up, and also requires more problem solving than most.

Really creative way of thinking strategically. There are sooo many maps to play, that you'll never get bored (if you enjoy the concept). It's not a graphics heavy type of game, or immersive, or anything like that. It's a basic strategy game, with the interesting addition of allowing you to make maps, and play other people's maps. I really love the concept behind the game, and after playing hundreds of tower defense tyle games (they're my favorite type of flash game) I can say that this style is one of the most unique I've seen, allows for more creativity in your set up, and also requires more problem solving than most. It's a great mixture of RTS and tower defense.\n\nMy only problem is that that game has a tendency of crashing when I try to open it up, but once it's open it runs totally fine.","July 24, 2014","true","45.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're on the fence about it, I highly recommend going to Kongregate and finding either the original Creeper World or the new Creeper World 3: Abraxsis mini game and playing a few levels.

Seriously.  I'm utterly shocked nobody else has stolen this and applied their own game to it yet.\nMaps vary wildly in difficulty, taxing your ability no matter how experienced you are at the game.\n\nCons:\nStory is short and painfully one-dimensional.\nBalancing issues abound.  Since the enemy never gets any stronger, and you never stop getting stronger, surviving the first few minutes is tantamount to winning the map; Clearing emitters is a formality.\nSome maps are 100% objectively impossible to beat.\nCertain achievements aren't so much "achievements" as "medals for playing a really really long time."\n\n--\nThat said, the game is worth playing for no other reason than to experience the unique gameplay.","September 2, 2014","true","132.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fair warning: you will become addicted to it, and rack up 20 hours playing it in a  single week. I've played it over 10 hours in two *days*.\n\nThe trailer, pictures, and even description on CW3's store page fail to do the game justice. It's RTS only in that you can place and move units while the timer is running. It's TD only in that your units only fire while sitting still, and half of your units can't move once placed. Allow me to paint you a different picture of this game. The creeper is like water that bubbles up from the ground, and you can't touch the water...because you're a cat with a lot of really cool turrets. Each of your turrets does something different. Half of your turrets aren't offensive devices; they're used to set up the infrastructure of your base, collecting resources, etc. Your energy recharges continuously, but your base can output more energy than it collects, and will eventually reach equillibrium with your input. When you start to net energy income, do you build more energy collectors, or new weapons? Eventually, you can terraform the map at large energy output, but you don't need the terraformers on constantly. Want a turret at a different location to combat the creeper? Your offensive turrets can fly. to new locations, but if your infrastructure hasn't caught up to the front, their ammo stores will drain rapidly.\n\nEach map is essentially a series of multi-step problems that can be solved in a variety of ways, especially as you unlock more turrets. Early in the game, it's pretty obvious what tactics the map maker had in mind, promarily because you haven't yet uinlocked all of the turrets. But not even half-way through the initial campaign, you come to understand the myriad paths you can take to solve each particular step of a problem. Terraforming is a big part of this: because you can literally change the shape of the map, setting up infrastructure one way opens up different solutions down the road.\n\nThe two extremes of the spectrum of CW3 players are probably Speed Runners <----> Slow and Steady. I'm the latter right now, which is one of the reasons missions take me so long: I spend more than half the run-time with the timer paused. But you've got to be careful while paused: queue up too many turrets, and your production rapidly outpaces your income, slowing your entire system. The game doesn't punish you for being either kind of player--on most levels, your resources don't dwindle over time, so you could play a single map for hours in a trenchy-style of building one row of turrets just in front of your previous row. The game *does* punish you for not paying attention--being fast is definitely doable if your minimalistic solution has all of the right components.\n\nCW3 is a phenomenal example of the adage: gamers prefer good mechanics to good graphics. But don't let the 2D simplistic art scheme fool you. Not only are the mechanics solid, the performance stellar, but the interface is also straight-forward, and the controls seem pretty intuitive. Left-click to select, right-click-hold to move around the map. Zoom in/out with mouse wheel. Escape to un-select or exit out of a selection. The visuals and animations tell you what you need to know, and if something isn't working like you expected, it's pretty easy to figure out why.\n\nI wouldn't say it's a difficult game in the initial campaign, but it *is* intense regardless of your strategy. There appear to be scads of maps that the community has created that will test your skills, as will the Challenge section by the developers, *and* the custom-level editor is built right into the frakking game.\n\nGeez...I haven't even gotten to the Titans yet....  :}","January 1, 2015","true","240.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seriously.  I'm utterly shocked nobody else has stolen this and applied their own game to it yet.\nMaps vary wildly in difficulty, taxing your ability no matter how experienced you are at the game.\n\nCons:\nStory is short and painfully one-dimensional.\nBalancing issues abound.  Since the enemy never gets any stronger, and you never stop getting stronger, surviving the first few minutes is tantamount to winning the map; Clearing emitters is a formality.\nSome maps are 100% objectively impossible to beat.\nCertain achievements aren't so much "achievements" as "medals for playing a really really long time."\n\n--\nThat said, the game is worth playing for no other reason than to experience the unique gameplay.","September 2, 2014","true","132.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought this game direct from the developer's website and played it for quite a while before activating it on Steam.  Plus, if you consider the first two games and the free versions on Kongregate, I've easily logged a hundred hours or more in the whole series.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of tower defense or RTS, but this game combines the two genres in a way that is incredibly fun.  The basic plot is that a "grey-goo" type of substance, called the Creeper, has taken over the galaxy, and it's up to you to fight back.  You plop down a Command Node, build a few Collectors to generate energy, and try to keep from being overwhelmed until you can build up enough to go on the offensive.  However, there is enough variation in the game mechanics that each map presents a new challenge and a new puzzle to solve.\n\nThere is one map (anyone who's played the game long enough will know the one I'm talking about) that really ruins the fun and actually put me off the game for a long while.  Unlike the others where you can take your time and develop whatever strategy you want, this one is a timed mission and a pretty tough one at that.  So consider yourself warned...\n\nBut otherwise, an absolute joy to play and definitely a strong addition to your library.","October 31, 2015","true","24.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Yes, I know there are other enemy-types besides the two mentioned above, but none that show up mid-game or late-game, to create dynamic havoc in your carefully laid plans.)\n\nThere IS the concept of pre-existing barriers that corrode, giving a timed threat-release, but these are rarely employed to anything like the full potential of providing a mid-game threat. Even if they did, there is nothing that provides a late-game threat or reversal of fortunes, no increasing flood of more powerful foes, etc. There is no ramping up of the initial threat which might turn the tide if you don't deploy for it. Really, the only way to lose a game at the mid-point or toward the end is user error, like uncovering a flank with anti-missle defenses and having an attack get through to the rear. Even then, if it doesn't cut off significant supply lines, which can easily be made redundant, then the front-line may not be affected at all by the misfortune.\n\nBut then... you can download fiendish levels that are user-made to solve that problem to a degree.\n\n8/10 (or relatively speaking, as fun and playable as any game in the Tower Defense genre available on Steam, if not more-so)","April 19, 2015","true","44.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It takes the gameplay of the original, and builds on it; interestingly, it gives you all of your old toys pretty quickly. The anti-creeper from the sequel makes a return, and works quite well. The level design was decent, although there were times when I felt it could've used work, and I rarely found it necessary to use more than one control node, with the exception of the timed missions.\n\nThe story was the weakest part, having reduced the cast to just two members: Abraxis and his ship's AI. There's some good world building, but I think it could've been greatly expanded upon, and the twist ending was really unexpected, and felt out of place. I'm not fond of stories that retcon their own history. If you want a great story, I'd recommend playing the original, which is still the best in this regard.\n\nI was honestly hoping for a longer experience overall, but there is replay value in the form of custom community maps (still haven't tried it yet), as well as a random map generator which need to be unlocked through the campaign. Something I'd love to see is a massive map, spanning several screens in size, with complex terrain and hidden secrets buried around the map; the only time you excavate anything in game is during the last level.\n\nOn the whole, fans of the genre will enjoy this, just don't expect any literary awards. 8/10.","June 18, 2015","true","23.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is addicting and has amazing replay value, I love jumping into it to to kill some time with a casual game, and the system requirements aren't too bad.\n\nFar and away my favorite feature is the new "Colonial Space", which allows you to download User-Created maps. More to the point the game supports custom scripts in mods, which means that dedicated users have been able to add new game mechanics to their custom maps to implement new superweapons, enemies, or even to allow you to play as the creeper! I haven't even finished the campaign, I just endlessly play custom maps. My only complaint is you're required to complete the game's tutorial missions in the campaign before you can play custom maps.\n\nAs a side note, I originally bought this game when it was standalone, and got a free Steam key when it became available on Steam, so kudos to Knuckle Cracker for that.","May 26, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having played Creeper World and Creeper World 2, this follows the game design of the former. While the graphics may be on a lower end than that of normal games, it provides hours and hours of fantastic gameplay.\n\nFor newbies. game elements are introduced to you slowly through the storyline, all the way up to the boss map (hello Thor!). The storyline does build off CW1 and CW2, so you might be a bit lost in understanding any plot and twists. Recommendation to play the first two iterations first - they are both great games.\n\nThe game allows you to freely tab out (I'm looking at you Popcap) while remaining in play, and you are able to micromanage and rearrange your defenses when paused - a definite plus. You also get multiple save slots! The speed up buttons are also a wonderful addition - anyone that has played tower defenses will appreciate speed up buttons (1x, 2x, 3x and 4x).\n\nPlus point is that all your games are cloud saved on Steam - no more having to rebeat the entire storymap and more when you change a new computer or accidentally clear your files! The Alpha and Prospector sector are two such additions which will provide an eternity more of gameplay once you finish storymode. The maps are heavily varied, ranging from small maps to huge maps - all of which will require different strategies. It doesn't feel like you're merely doing the same thing over and over again. And if you ever finish the abovementioned sectors (has anyone?!), there are plenty more user-made levels for you to try out.\n\nAn average map generally ranges about 15 - 25 minutes to win. It's a great game to play in between other games for a short break or while waiting for queue times.\n\nFor only SGD15.00, easily worth every single cent. 10/10","January 5, 2015","true","40.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a RTS Tower defense-esque game, this might not sound like a good idea, but it works beautifully. There are two main mechanics that I will address:\n\n1. The Creeper. This is your enemy, it's a liquid entity that creeps forward from spawners, slowly covering more and more of the stage. You need to build towers to fight it back, and in turn advance farther along the stage yourself. Creeper would be very difficult to deal with if it didn't obey the laws of physics. Basically, in order for creeper to overflow onto a higher level of terrain, it has to have nowhere else to go on its current level. This leads to some fairly interesting placements, like a very powerful spawner at the bottom of a deep crater. There are plenty of other enemies too, runners and digitalis namely. Runners just run along digitalis and need to be destroyed with sniper towers, they can't directly destroy your towers, but can stun them long enough for creeper to overflow onto them. Digitalis is a kind of grid-like enemy that conducts creeper and prevents towers from being built, trust me, it's more difficult than it sounds.\n\n2. The Network. This game has parallels to a tower defense game, but calling it one doesn't do it justice. The biggest conventional differences being: Towers are networked, they have to be connected to your base to function; Towers can be moved freely, even off the network, albeit with limited ammo; towers use energy, constantly.\n\nThe biggest difference as I stated is the network. You have to build collectors and relays between towers to provide pathways for the "packets" of which there are three types, ammo, construction, and totem. This means you can't just build towers in the most strategic spots right away, you have to build out to them, often fighting tooth and nail to get to them. Additionally, these packets cost energy, which is distributed evenly between the active types of packets, energy is obtained through collectors, which collect energy across an area, and reactors. Collectors gain no benefit from overlapping area and should be spread out, they are also one of the main staples in your network of towers. If you get too ambitious with your expansion, you'll enter energy starvation, where packets are produced less efficiently and you run the risk of your blasters running out of ammo and the line being pushed back.\n\nBetween the campaign mode and the hundreds of other levels in the game + fan made ones, you could get hundreds of hours out of this game (I didn't because I just played creeper world 1 and 2 before it and was done after the campaign). Having played all three games, this is the best.\n\nEven at full price, I think you'll get your money's worth, this is a difficult game, you will need to think strategically and act quickly. It's a refreshing change of pace from most RTS and tower defense games in my opinion.","December 31, 2014","true","29.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It takes the gameplay of the original, and builds on it; interestingly, it gives you all of your old toys pretty quickly. The anti-creeper from the sequel makes a return, and works quite well. The level design was decent, although there were times when I felt it could've used work, and I rarely found it necessary to use more than one control node, with the exception of the timed missions.\n\nThe story was the weakest part, having reduced the cast to just two members: Abraxis and his ship's AI. There's some good world building, but I think it could've been greatly expanded upon, and the twist ending was really unexpected, and felt out of place. I'm not fond of stories that retcon their own history. If you want a great story, I'd recommend playing the original, which is still the best in this regard.\n\nI was honestly hoping for a longer experience overall, but there is replay value in the form of custom community maps (still haven't tried it yet), as well as a random map generator which need to be unlocked through the campaign. Something I'd love to see is a massive map, spanning several screens in size, with complex terrain and hidden secrets buried around the map; the only time you excavate anything in game is during the last level.\n\nOn the whole, fans of the genre will enjoy this, just don't expect any literary awards. 8/10.","June 18, 2015","true","23.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All buldings need to be connected to a resource network and many of the buildings can be moved in a way similar to the Terran buildings in StarCraft.\n\nThe main enemy is the creeper, which is a fluid flowing out of emitters.\nThis fluid will flow downhill which is usually towards you.\nYou cannot build in creeper and it destroys your buildings if it touches them.\nThe maps have 10 height levels and you can build terraformers to change the terrain gradually. This gives you tons of tactical options. The simplest example would be to build yourself a high wall as protection against the creeper.\nBeware that creeper levels accumulate and if you do not destroy some, it will flow over your precious walls.\nYou have various guns and mortars in your arsenal to destroy the creeper and you can even deploy your own anti-creeper, but this is just pushing back against the endless flow.\nTo stop new creeper from forming, you need to push towards the emitter and build a special building, the nullifier, and protect it until it powers up enough to destroy the emitter.\n\nThere are other interesting foes and obstacles, which I will not spoil here.\nThe bread and butter of the enemy is the creeper emitter.\n\nMost of the tension for me was usually in the early game, where I needed to stave off the creeper while building my resource economy and it's often about eeking out tiny little advantages until I could stably match the creeper. After that, the aggressive phase starts.\n\nThere are dozens of interesting story missions with diverse leveldesigns where you need different strategies to win.\n\nAfter beating the story missions, which took me about 30 hours!, you have a sheer endless supply of challenge maps, as well as tons of user generated maps.\n\nThough I find that the challenge maps aren't as diverse as the story maps, so once you find your dominant strategy, they tend to play out similarly.\n\nCreeper World 3 is also an excellent podcast game, since all relevant information is presented visually.\n\nThe game gets a clear purchase recommendation from me.\nYou can play the demo version beforehand, you can find that on the developer's website.\n\nCreeper World 3 has a crazy high rating of 97% on Steam, which I think is because the Trailer shows you exactly what you can expect from the game.\n\n\n","July 12, 2015","true","35.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Still one could complain about the graphics, however the makers chose a clear art style and it works. Eye candy and high fidelity is nice but it can easily distract. That said the difference in terrain height could have been more clear. Now you have to hover over the terrain and look at the lower interface bar to know if you are in a valley or on top of a mountain. Perhaps CW 4 can improve on this.\n\nFor me the biggest miss is multiplayer, why this is lacking surprises me the most. How cool to play this with your friends. Both co-op and comp would be awesome.\n\nSo, are you doubting to buy this game?

If you liked it before, you'll love this.\n\nIf not, then you're also in for a treat! CW is very, very good. People compare it to tower defence, but I usually describe it as a computer network fighting a liquid. The lines you see in the screenshots are the links between your units - if a unit becomes disconnected, it won't get resupplied and will eventually become defenceless. So, keeping supply lines going is incredibly important. The other thing is that your primary enemy is a corrosive purple liquid - it has no AI whatsoever, it just flows following the terrain. (Or sometimes it moves in other ways - the more scripted maps can have it behave in stranger ways.) The third thing is that terrain is everything. Perhaps the best defence in this game is just a really high wall... until the creeper overflows it!\n\nThis is a game about attacking, not defending however. Pushing forwards, often uphill, can be very tricky because most of your units can't attack upwards, and the creeper naturally flows down on top of you. Then you have to handle beach landings, and spore towers that will dump creeper right in your base, and runners that stun your units, and then all of these at the same time, uphill, with a time limit, along with all kinds of one-off scripted challenges too!\n\nLater in the campaign you'll unlock units that can modify the terrain (slowly) and let you build a series of stepping stones above the creeper, or build walls to protect your home, or produce helpful "anti-creeper", or send supply ships to bridge between islands, or try to push the creeper away with force fields, or all sorts of other cool things. The fact that it's so freeform lets you find a style that's comfortable. I'm a big fan of terrain fiddling myself.\n\nSeriously, this game has so many original ideas, and it's executed really well. Perhaps not the prettiest of games, but it's very clever, and it'll make you feel clever when you finally conquer a map that's taken you hours. I can't recommend it highly enough.","October 9, 2015","true","53.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically, you're fighting a liquid. This liquid flows from higher elevation to lower elevation (like liquid does). There are emitters that pour this liquid out of them at specific intervals. You have several ways of corraling and destroying this liquid. Destroying thin liquid with laser turrets, deep liquid with mortars, or distant liquid with strafers. Corraling liquid with terraformers to lower or highten the terrain or shields that shove the liquid around. Or, even combinations of the two with anti-liquid that doesn't damage your towers and can destroy the bad liquid.\n\nThere are several play-modes too.\n\nThe campaign starts you off with very little unlocked and very easy missions. As it progresses, you unlock more turrets, learning what each does with the missions getting harder and harder. Eventually, you have nearly everything and the missions have reached alarming difficulty, requiring epic strategy to beat, making each mission defeated a great accomplishment and very satisfying.\n\nColonial Space has a huge array of player created maps given ratings for each one with varying difficulties and extreme customization for each level.\n\nAlpha Sector is filled with misisons created by alpha testers of the game.\n\nTormented Space and Prospector Zone have maps randomly generated by the engine.\n\nThis game is all about strategy, and nothing to do with luck. Love it.\n\nI may be a little biased though, I've followed this series of games since the first. Creeper World was unique and amazing. Creeper World 2 was... okay, he took some aspects of the first one and made a different type of game that wasn't as well balanced nor built. But Creeper World 3 went back to the original gameplay of the first one, and he added many things to it, balanced it out, and made it a whole lot better.","October 9, 2015","true","75.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the challenge comes from the map itself. Some story and player maps have very diverse objectives and obstacles, so if you got bored, go to Alpha Sector or Colonial Space.\n- Some maps can take you up to 2 HOURS to complete!\n- If you are a completionist type of guy - good luck to you XD !

It takes the gameplay of the original, and builds on it; interestingly, it gives you all of your old toys pretty quickly. The anti-creeper from the sequel makes a return, and works quite well. The level design was decent, although there were times when I felt it could've used work, and I rarely found it necessary to use more than one control node, with the exception of the timed missions.\n\nThe story was the weakest part, having reduced the cast to just two members: Abraxis and his ship's AI. There's some good world building, but I think it could've been greatly expanded upon, and the twist ending was really unexpected, and felt out of place. I'm not fond of stories that retcon their own history. If you want a great story, I'd recommend playing the original, which is still the best in this regard.\n\nI was honestly hoping for a longer experience overall, but there is replay value in the form of custom community maps (still haven't tried it yet), as well as a random map generator which need to be unlocked through the campaign. Something I'd love to see is a massive map, spanning several screens in size, with complex terrain and hidden secrets buried around the map; the only time you excavate anything in game is during the last level.\n\nOn the whole, fans of the genre will enjoy this, just don't expect any literary awards. 8/10.","June 18, 2015","true","23.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are no "lanes" or marching mindless enemies, but there is a network of towers that will desperately fire a nonstop barrage to hold back the enemy long enough for a careful strike against their resource nodes. You hope. For a faceless enemy, you truly feel like you are facing down an infinite and eternal threat. There was never any hope for survivival in this unforgiving universe, but you will carve out a section of peace in your small quadrant for as long as you are able.

Instead of fighting individual units that make a bee-line for your core, you fight a substance known as Creep; A liquid substance with physics similar to water and the same goal as Grey-Goo.  For those of you not familiar with Grey-Goo, it is a popular science fiction end of the world scenario, where some type of substance achieves sentience and begins consuming everything it can reach, creating more of itself as it constantly pushes on, eventually driving the planet to extinction or perishing itself.  This is your enemy in the game.  You fight on individual planets by utilizing topography of the land, claiming high points as your base of operation to give you time to build up a defense against the flowing creep, while emitters and spawners constantly create more creep that will slowly fill up the map.  You must constantly push forward with several tower types, while creating supply lines and other resource units to power your towers, so that you can reach the creep's cores and emitters and destroy them to cease the flow.  The game is easy to pick up and learn to play, but some levels can be extremely hard to beat.  I personally took over two hours on a single level because of a small error I made that almost wiped out my entire base, forcing me to start from scratch while the creep had already filled up most of the map.  The game even features a large amount of user made maps and a built in, easy to use level editor so you can make and share with friends and the community.\n\nI highly recommend you get this game.","June 14, 2015","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved it when I found the first game, the second, and now the third.  I seriously recommend it, as there are thousands of hours of great strategic playing with the hundreds of thousands of worlds, created by players, the Dial-Map-Device, or the story/basic game.  The story is pretty great.  What I like most about it would be the how easy it is to make your own enemies or friendlies.  CW3:AE uses a very simple stack-based language, with an in-depth tutorial on the wiki.  It's definitely worth the money if you're into strategic games, or just messing around.","June 14, 2015","true","155.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you liked it before, you'll love this.\n\nIf not, then you're also in for a treat! CW is very, very good. People compare it to tower defence, but I usually describe it as a computer network fighting a liquid. The lines you see in the screenshots are the links between your units - if a unit becomes disconnected, it won't get resupplied and will eventually become defenceless. So, keeping supply lines going is incredibly important. The other thing is that your primary enemy is a corrosive purple liquid - it has no AI whatsoever, it just flows following the terrain. (Or sometimes it moves in other ways - the more scripted maps can have it behave in stranger ways.) The third thing is that terrain is everything. Perhaps the best defence in this game is just a really high wall... until the creeper overflows it!\n\nThis is a game about attacking, not defending however. Pushing forwards, often uphill, can be very tricky because most of your units can't attack upwards, and the creeper naturally flows down on top of you. Then you have to handle beach landings, and spore towers that will dump creeper right in your base, and runners that stun your units, and then all of these at the same time, uphill, with a time limit, along with all kinds of one-off scripted challenges too!\n\nLater in the campaign you'll unlock units that can modify the terrain (slowly) and let you build a series of stepping stones above the creeper, or build walls to protect your home, or produce helpful "anti-creeper", or send supply ships to bridge between islands, or try to push the creeper away with force fields, or all sorts of other cool things. The fact that it's so freeform lets you find a style that's comfortable. I'm a big fan of terrain fiddling myself.\n\nSeriously, this game has so many original ideas, and it's executed really well. Perhaps not the prettiest of games, but it's very clever, and it'll make you feel clever when you finally conquer a map that's taken you hours. I can't recommend it highly enough.","October 9, 2015","true","53.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Campaign, random gen maps, many different strategies to win with, pacing you can choose in most maps. If you ever liked games where you are constantly fighting the horde, this is an RTS that takes that concept to the core. Here the horde isn't zombies or aliens, here it is a gelatinous fluid that spreads at a constant rate from various emittors. That is it. Shoot it, blow it up, build up walls to contain it or protect yourself with, it will eventually flood the map higher than the highest mountains if you do not stem the tide. It is relentless. This game tickles a specific 'kill the horde' thing I have in my head every now and then and does so in a memorable way. I already have plenty of time in the non-Steam version before unlocking it on Steam, I'm playing on here simply to gather achievements on top of playing normally but I'm not playing specifically for the achievements. This game is simply a great time-filler between other games, like right now I'm bored of various FPS's and RTS's in my library and just want some straight up fun. Not too simple, not overly complex, the graphics are functional and have their own aesthetic I appreciate.

I was quickly hooked on the campaign but then I got to Tormented Space which seemed impossible. I went to the prospector zone and it had many planets that were all too easy until I ran across Molreport which again was impossible. Seems like the planets are either too easy or impossible once you finish the short campaign which ends without a word of explanation.\n\nI have only seen a small fraction of the Arc Eternal universe so I don't know if there are going to be more challenging planets. I'm beginning to think that like most games that rely on user created maps, that there is a lot of tedium. You'll have to look hard to find challenging games once you finish the short campaign.\n\nThere isn't a lot of variety in the buildings. If you zoom in close there isn't anything to see. There isn't much in the way of detailed tool tips. That's too bad because specific information could make a difference. I enjoyed terraforming my way into enemy territory but building shields is faster and less complicated. You just build millions of generators and then shield your way into the deep stuff and rip out the bad things by the roots. Bombers, straffers and guppies are there but they are rather tedious and much less effective. I didn't see people putting up lots of experience nodes to capture that might encourage you to level up your ore and AC carrying capacity in order to launch a big D day type invasion.\n\nI would highly recomend this game at the sale price especially if the professional types are going to build a longer campaign that is as delightful as their earlier campaign but this is not up there in quality like Mount and Blade or Kerbal Space Program. If their mission was to show those corporate types that they could do as good a job as any big studio, they didn't succeed. If Stardock is the MacDonalds of gaming then these guys are the Chinese takeout that opened on the corner with the crispy vegetables, delicious sauces and suspiciously slippery meat.","December 5, 2015","true","114.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can vaporize it with lasers, blow it up with mortars, hit it with air strikes, and even terraform the landscape to trap it--for a while. The catch is that all of these things require energy, and you've got to find a balance between building up your energy supply while also building up your defenses. If you don't have enough of one or the other, the never-ending flow of creeper will slowly overwhelm your city. It's an excellent strategy game that combines defensive thinking and resource management.\n\nFor those who have played CW1:\nThis is mostly the same game, but with a story-mode and plenty of new levels. There's also a few new toys to play with, like ways to generate your own "anti-creeper," ways to terraform the terrain, and even ways to fly energy packets to remote areas that are not connected to your network. The creeper also has a few new tricks including "digitalis" which spreads faster and is harder to destroy but is limited to pre-defined paths, and "runners" which are little mobs that can temporarily disable your structures.\n\nI could knock the game for not being more innovative, but I liked CW1 enough that I thoroughly enjoyed having a similar experience again.","August 11, 2015","true","41.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It grows on you however, as a long form strategy game unlike any other I've played before. I also found myself enticed by the story and the imagination therein. Some missions are challenging, but when you get past those hurdles you realise it's fair difficulty, and most of the time it's simply your build order that might need revising for that mission.\n\nIt's somewhere between Total Annihilation and Starcraft. The only thing that really bothered me was the music.","January 1","true","55.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has the feel of a tower defense game, but instead of fighting hordes of ever increasingly strong creatures, you're fighting 'the blob' as I like to call it. If you're not careful, you are overwhelmed easily. It may seem simple, but the levels keep advancing and getting more tactical, while the core of the game remains.

There is a Campaign, which has a story you probably only understand if you have played the previus games, but the story is just basicly a big tutorial introducing you step by step to every unit and taktik. the graphics are bad for today but it just doesnt matter because you wont have the time looking att the landscape because after the campaign there are hundreds of levels to beat and only a few are easy , also usergenerated content. I wont say anything on how this game works because you should see it in the trailers and gameplays etc.\n\nA little note: You can beat nearly every Level in ca.20 minutes, but only if you are realy good. Most of the time it takes 45-100 minutes to beat a single level, so you will need some time.","August 9, 2015","true","52.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can vaporize it with lasers, blow it up with mortars, hit it with air strikes, and even terraform the landscape to trap it--for a while. The catch is that all of these things require energy, and you've got to find a balance between building up your energy supply while also building up your defenses. If you don't have enough of one or the other, the never-ending flow of creeper will slowly overwhelm your city. It's an excellent strategy game that combines defensive thinking and resource management.\n\nFor those who have played CW1:\nThis is mostly the same game, but with a story-mode and plenty of new levels. There's also a few new toys to play with, like ways to generate your own "anti-creeper," ways to terraform the terrain, and even ways to fly energy packets to remote areas that are not connected to your network. The creeper also has a few new tricks including "digitalis" which spreads faster and is harder to destroy but is limited to pre-defined paths, and "runners" which are little mobs that can temporarily disable your structures.\n\nI could knock the game for not being more innovative, but I liked CW1 enough that I thoroughly enjoyed having a similar experience again.","August 11, 2015","true","41.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to set a perimeter using your resources the best you can and then kill the creeper back. Once you set your perimeter you have a guaranteed win. Its just a matter of patience. The game play is what gets this game such high score reviews, so im not sure this is a bad thing per se.
