Does that sound like fun to you? If so this could be right up your ally.\n\n\nI must have played over 400 hours of this game heck maybe even more, I re-bought it here on steam as my old disk became unable to load after 15 years of dragging it in and out of the CD rom.. It is a wonderful delight for any old comic book fan. the characters are campy like the old batman/superman tv shows. The stories are fun and characters are a hoot.\n\nCharacters like the fun loving sea urchin, or the speedy southern boy "Bullet." Mentor the master of mind control or Melancholy "Man-Bot" will keep you going through the different stories and invested in the them The only thing better than the characters are the villains, and the guy narrating does a great job. The game has many short stories, which play like episodes and they all lead up to a final showdown, worth getting too. (20-30 hours on average i would say)\n\nThe game has massive re-playability with leveling different characters, I think there are 12+ and  you could play through the game 10 times and still have more characters to try. Not to mention the many character combo's and who to use the XP canisters to level up more. Leveling up certain characters can really makes them shine and give a whole new way to play them. Mixing and matching can lead to tons of different ways to play the levels. Who you bring on each mission, and which ones you give canisters too can really change the whole feel of the game.\n\nI will say, the interface and game play takes a lot to get used to, if you aren't familiar with the older GUI's from the 90's it can be tough. But once you figure out how the hits work, and AOE powers and such, it really is fantastic.  Just play the game in win98 Compatibility and run as an Admin and you should have no issues, but some do, and I am not sure why. Try reading some of the trouble shooting tips if you are having issues. Outside of the getting to run issue, I have very rarely hit a bug, and typically when they happen you can restart the mission and you should not see it again. Just remember to make a save after or before each mission just in case, as the auto-saves are not very often.\n\nThis is one of my favorite games ever made, while FFII, was good, it just is not as good as the first. But if you do like this one, I highly recommend the sequel as it really is more of the same with some better balance. The second is a bit shorter, and is lacking in the amount of new characters. The game is more of a continuation that feels like an expansion verse the whole game of the first. That said, it really is to bad that Irrational never made a third because even an expansion of this to me is better than tons of stuff out there on the market. Maybe one day, but till then try it..  The game is "Antastic!"","July 22, 2014","true","28.2"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wazron/recommended/8880/","wazron","wozron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wazron/","270 products in account","Firstly, I'd just lke to say that I bought Freedom Force (FF) at full retail years ago, and I've only just bought it on Steam due to ease of use. Don't let my 'time playing' mislead you as to my level of experience with this game.\n\nSecondly, I am a massive turn-based tactical (TBT) nut. I love TBT games. A game in which intelligence rather than reflex speed rewards the player is my idea of heaven. I'm an older gamer, and despite plenty of time in Doom (and sequels), Duke Nukem 3D, Borderlands, ARMA, BF2 etc., I find my reflexes just can't keep up with the young'uns any more.\n\nAnd so this brings us to Freedom Force, a realtime-with-pause superhero game that pays shameless homage to the pulpy artwork and storylines of Jack Kirby, the single most important figure in Golden Age comics (sorry, Stan Lee).\n\nWhile not a TBT game per se, Freedom Force has the same structure of rewarding mind over muscle. The game starts slowly enough, with a single brawler-type character called The Patriot- an analogue of Captain America- and soon expands to incorporate other hero and heroine archetypes. Gaining experience gives you resources that allow you to add new characters from a bank of heroes that you encounter along the way.\n\nOne of the primary points of difference is the ability to also use these resources to recruit a custom character. I've played a couple of superhero-themed MMO's and the area in which they all fall flat is character creation. Where they offer 'archetypes' that require your superhero to conform to a template, Freedom Force gives you complete leeway to create any kind of superhero you want. The only limitation is that the more powerful you make your custom character, the longer it will take to obtain the resources you need to field that character.\n\nNow, I'm not exaggerating when I say 'complete leeway'. Want a flying character who drains enemy special powers in a brilliant purple beam then fires them back in a green fireball that does AoE and DoT damage? Done. Want a 'Hulk' style character who throws cars around and absorbs enemy attacks to get stronger? Easy peasy. Want a male toon that seduces enemies into leaving cover using blown kisses, a la a cross-dressing Bugs Bunny, so that your compatriots can smash them flat? Well, it's not very fifties, but I'm sure it's possible.\n\nIn playing Freedom Force, you will encounter all kinds of classic 1950's enemies, from evil, Communist ice-villains and  giant radioactive ants to self-duplicating cloners. This is where the incredibly deep customisation system comes into play. Every defence has a counter. Every counter has a counter-counter. It's a lot like the Cold War in that respect.\n\nBut all that aside, Freedom Force looks and plays brilliantly for a twelve-year-old game. With a fiendish, but not ridiculous difficulty level, amazingly deep customisation, cerebral gameplay and a perfect Kirby aesthetic, Freedom Force is likely the most underrated game ever released.\n\nPROS:\n-Deepest customisation ever seen in the superhero genre\n-Great storyline\n-Loving homage to Golden-Age comics\n\nCONS:\n-Graphics are soooo last-generation.\n-Takes ages to get stupidly overpowered custom characters into the game.\n\nNEEDS:\n-A reboot, with better graphics, possibly set in the Silver Age of comics (1970's-1980's) incorporating new threats and themes. I'd buy it in a heartbeat.\n\nWILL APPEAL TO:\n-Golden Age comics fans\n-Superhero fans who really want to create their 'perfect hero'\n-People tired of superhero MMO's but still looking for caped action\n-People looking for an tactical game with more flexibility than traditional TBT\n\n\n","December 10, 2014","true","9.8"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

I wanted to play it, but was never able to. So I finally looked up the CD code and loaded the game. Then I found out it was outdated. So naturally I looked on Steam. I was excited to find it, but when I got it I found it had some compatibility issues with Window 8. I knew this would happen from reading some reviews and followed the steps one of the reviews listed and ran the game that way. It worked perfectly!\nGameplay was torturous at first. If you directed a character to a location, he (or she) would run off in some other direction most of the time and it took a lot of attention to keep the characters on task and became impossible eventually. When I followed the suggested steps, the gameplay was perfect!\nThe game is hilarious at the same time as being action packed. The click discriptions are plain funny and the catch-phrases are comically old-fangled. The graphics are simpler than modern games (as it is old), but it's altogether awesome! The role-playing mechanics are very sound and make a lot of sense.\n\nThis game has all the elements of a good comic superhero world.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TimeRuptured/recommended/8880/","TimeRuptured","TimeRuptured","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TimeRuptured/","367 products in account","I first got this game several years ago, played a ton of it, and was pleased to find it was on Steam along with its sequel (which I unfortunately haven't played as of yet). It's an enjoyable real-time pause-based strategy game set in a 40s-50s era metropolis filled with superheroes and villians.\n\nOverall, the main appeal this game has (at least for me) is how much like a comic book it actually is. The writing is fun and incredibly campy (and revels in it), and very cartoonish, but it has its more serious moments too. The characters are all knockoffs of actual comic book superheroes and villians (though I didn't catch some of the parallels. Granted, I'm not well-versed in comics), but each has his or her own twist, and I found them all enjoyable, and while fairly cliché, they worked well. Personally I found the game to be hilarious, but I do enjoy some campiness now and then.\n\nThe gameplay itself, as I mentioned, is a mix between real-time and turn-based gameplay, with events happening in real time, and the issuing of commands done while the game is paused, though you can still issue some commands (such as a certain attack or movement) in real time as well. Sometimes the pathfinding is a bit clunky, but it works, and any little quirks can usually be fixed with a quick pause or micromanagement. The game also features many destructible objects (including buildings) for you to knock down, pick up, wield as clubs, throw, blow up, etc., all the better to dispatch the enemy henchmen with. Enemy variety and the simple aesthetic of the game make this all the more enjoyable. Something that also pleasantly surprised me (although I could just be bad) is that the game is fairly challenging, and a few moves can mean the difference between failure and success. It's not particularly brutal or anything, but it's not exactly a breeze, which is nice.\n\nThe game is structured in different missions (complete with a comic book cover loading screen, but with modern systems you might not have time to appreciate them), with several usually spanning a certain villian, before their inevitable demise. Between these missions, you have several different options to upgrade your heroes using experience you accumulate during the missions, as well as hire new heroes with a 'currency' called prestige which you gain from completing objectives. The most enjoyable part about this is that the game also includes a hero editor, wherein you can create your own superhero, and you may then hire them using prestige to play them in your campaign, though this isn't necessary to complete the game by any means.\n\nAs for the Steam version, I did have a bug when I attempted to play the game, in which the default left click action is set to attack and cannot be changed (on the forums this is sometimes called the 'Fist Bug' if you need help), meaning you can't click to move (though you may still move and use other actions using the right click command interface). For me, this was fixed by verifying the cache, but this may not work for everyone. (EDIT: If this did work and you have the issue once again, I found you need to verify the cache each time you launch the game. It's a bit annoying, but it only takes a few seconds. However, I personally need to redownload a 24 KB file (though this does happen automatically and quickly after hitting the Verify Game Cache button in the preferences), so if constant internet connectivity is a problem, be warned.) Keep in mind this game is over ten years old now, and you will likely have some compatability issues. From the sound of it, most can be fixed, but do be warned.\n\nOverall, I found it a fun little romp through a comic book world, and I highly recommend it if it sounds remotely interesting. You can pick up both this game and its sequel in a bundle for the same price as one, so why not try both? (EDIT January 1st, 2016: During this winter sale, it appears the bundle with both games is now about 40 cents more (unsure of other regions). Still, it's incredibly close.)\n\nEDIT: If this isn't enough, John "TotalBiscuit" Bain recently called this game "f***ing great" on the December 17th episode of the Co-Optional Podcast.","July 2, 2015","true","5.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Set in an alternative history where random individuals were given super powers, they decide to become super heroes and villains, and the sort of stories we normally see in comic books are what results. You control a squad of these do-gooders over the course of the campaign, and level them up how you see fit through all sorts of random adventures. Combat is real-time, albeit with pause.

Of course you do! In this comic game player takes control of superhero band - each with their own strengths and weaknesess. We play through the campaign, while taking care of recruiting new heroes and getting up the abilities of the older ones. There is of course an option to create your own hero - and why not?\n\nAmongst many others there are such character archetypes as Captain America rip-off (main hero) and his sidekick, Jalapeno Guy (Mexican with fiery powers), Ant Man (selfexplanatory), compulsory Good Alien From Totally Evil Alien Race, Magician Girl, Ironman rip-off (based on his early images), an Reprogrammed Android Turned Good and many more (there is even Aquaman rip-off).\n\nOverall the game isn't hard, but forces player to really plan his movies. There are also weaknesess and special abilities - some of our guys can fly, other just hop on the buildings, while trying to look cool. Even simple thugs with weapons can be dangerous for our merry band of heroes. There is no life regeneration, so the only health we'll get back is because of use special health kits or hero medals (which are special 'one-off' abilities and can be also used to ressurect or buff our characters).\n\nOption of active pause makes the game really interesting, especially because without it everything would dissolve into colorful chaos. It's not really that heavy on computer because cartoonish graphics don't really use any fancy effects. Even on my olden laptop I didn't really got any slowdowns - and that's something with all the stuff and explosions on the screen.\n\nThe worthy successor to the game is Freedom Force vs. the Third Reich with deals with different main villain and wholly different story - and time travel of course... because, why not?","January 30, 2014","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They are also two of the singularly most unappreciated titles in the history of gaming.

It also helps that the game is hilarious, honest to god one of the genuinely funny titles I've ever played.\n\nBasically these games are just ♥♥♥♥in great, they're cheap as hell, and they continue to work flawlessly even in Windows 7.

I loved this game as a kid but in its current state its just not worth your money.\n\nValve should be a bit embarassed for promoting (putting on sale!) stuff like this without checking if its actually playable.  With a 90% metacritic review, and reasonable price, I bet a ton of people have bought this only to discover they've thrown money away on something completely unplayable.\n\nI hope the new refund policy helps people avoid traps like this and helps games like this get cleaned up or get taken off the store.

The whole concept of it sounds amazing, the graphics are fairly good, and the comic book geek in me sobs at having to admit that I didn't like it. However, after giving it a try, I have to say just that: I didn't like it. The controls gave me some trouble, the hit boxes seemed to be annoying, and the interface drove me up the wall. I was never a fan of this style of 'overhead gaming' in the NES, and here, it didn't do anything with it that made me like it even more.\n\nOne day, I may come back and try this again, and see whether the game may live up to my expectations with a rest break.

FF and FF vs the 3rd Reich are not just an excellent homage to the Silver Age of Comic books and indeed America in the 50s and 60s in general - more than that they are very skillfully produced strategy games, with the added charm of rpg-style character upgrading and customisation. If half of the bad games produced in the name of the big hitters of the comics industry such as Marvel and DC comics were as ernestly produced and with the same love and care for the medium of comics as Freedom Force, many of them would dominate the charts without any problems.

Your workaround may need to differ, but for me playing on Win-7 64bit.\n\n(1) Fist icon that won't change to move or interact:  In STEAM I deleted the local files through the LIBRARY-> GAMES menu and then reinstalled them using STEAM.  I had to do this every time before I played the game again.  "Deleting the local files" does not delete your saved games.  This worked 100% of the time...although I guess I did have to delete the game...reinstall the game...restart Windows twice.\n\n(2) The missing NEXT prompt on the hero exp screen:  This issue was a bit more irritating.  You need to do one of two things depending on where you're at in the campaign.  In the mission summary screen there will ALWAYS be a NEXT button.  On that screen you either:   (a) save the game  (b)exit the campaign (c) load the save you just saved\n\nOR\n\npress NEXT and go to the exp with a NEXT button.\n\nSaddly it's very contextual which way works.  I made sure to save the game before ending a mission so if I picked the wrong way I could just reload at the end of the mission and use the other method.\n\nNot many games are worth this much hassle to play, but I'm glad I went through the bother.\n\nThis is a GREAT game.","April 6, 2015","true","45.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The comicbook style is allot of fun and there are lots of hero characters to play with. Of course the game plot is about as interesting as an old Saturday morning cartoon show, shallow and flashy and melodramatic in a way that quickly becomes dull. But you will be too busy trying to get your heroes to work together to worry about the story too much. In fact that is probably the biggest weakness of the game. I felt sometimes like I was herding my heroes rather than playing with them, clicking and cajoling to try and get them to do what I wanted them do. A hero might not pick up that lamp post unless you line him up just right, or a hero might throw something that somehow ends up bouncing right back into his face, or a hero will just stand there and get punched in the head over and over unless you specifically tell him to stand up for himself and hit the thug back. Because the heroes rely on you so completely for all their intelligence and control this is definitely a strategy-RPG, and a little bit of patience may be needed to get around some of these small frustrations. Active pause helps allot.\n\nIn the end this game just lacked that special something, that little bit of polish, that sense of smooth gameplay, that feeling of depth that makes the great games so great. This game is definitely worth a shot but don't expect it to take the place of your other favorite CRPGs (unless you really have a thing for Golden Age super heroes).","May 3, 2014","true","25.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But don't let any of these biases fool you, this is a wonderful game that deserves any and all praise heaped upon it.\n\nForm the common comic book tropes that are taken and slightly skewed, to the awesomely imitated art style of the Ditko/Romita classic Silver Age, to the isometric part real time strategy gameplay that focused on mixing superpowers (even of custom characters!) to best effect in destructible environments, this game checked off so many things that I adore.\n\nIt's a shame that Irrational studios is downsizing because I always hoped that they would eventually go back to the proverbial well and give us another Freedom Force, but it apparently is not in the cards.

Shame they went bust and never produced a more modern version.  HD graphics needed, and better less silver age storyline.  Still fantastic classic.  multi plaYER maybe...  Maybe someone will make another - the making your powers section is uber brilliant...","May 17","true","61.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was both a computer game lame and a comicbook nerd, so this title was right up my ally. Normally I would say something like, if you have a soft spot for isometric RPGs and silver age campiness you shout try this... but no.\n\nThere are a lot of compatibility issues with modern OS and some cause game breaking glitches early on making it literally unplayable. I got the double pack... let's hope FF vs. The Third Riech works.","January 2","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

WAS. Now it's a glitchy mess. Before I got the compatability run, the game would have the heroes go off in random directions or randomly beat up civilians. While I got this fixed, the bigger problem now is that I can't properly close the game. Either it would close by crashing or not even close at all, prompting me to reset my computer just because I can't access Task Manager to close it from there.\n\nDon't get this game unless you know exactly how to fix these glitches or they get patched, which considering how old this game is, is unlikely.","April 25","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I clicked play again, remembered the issue with the mouse, pressed alt+f4, opened Google, Searched for "Frredom Force Mouse issue", Google asks me did you mean "Freedom Force Mouse issue", yes I did Google, thank you very much for passively-aggressively auto-correcting me, found some forums with the same issue, created an icon on the desktop, double clicked it, the mouse worked... huzzah. I'm so glad I paid money already; I'm solving puzzles before the game even launches!","May 30","false","1.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
