Popular mods expand the map size and number of players even further, and there are also popular AI tweak mods. Kohan 2 is perhaps best played as a skirmish game.\n\nUnfortunately despite being a ground breaking technical achievement unlike any other RTS ever made, Kohan 2 was released practically unannounced two days before the release of Rome Total War, which was simply impossible to compete against. It also had a terrible reception among hardcore fans of the original Kohan, who had some legitimate reasons to be upset.\n\nHowever, taken as a stand alone game and in it's current state this game is well worth picking up. It's a 4X Masterpiece unlike any other and it holds up well to this day. It's one of the best games you could ever spend $9 on if you like 4X Strategy Games or Fantasy RTS games.\n\nI highly recommend it.\n\nI also highly recommend the Flexible Support Units mod, as it makes the game more challenging, and allows more tactical flexibility. Check out the link for mods.\nhttp://www.gamefront.com/files/listing/pub2/Kohan_II_Kings_of_War/Modifications/","February 8, 2014","true","53.5"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","37","41","0","0"

The graphics show its age, but the originality of the title still shines through. Unlike most RTS games where single units are recruited, in Kohan you recruit companies make up of a variety of frontline, flank and support units, which offers a level of customization in its thousands of variations that you don't see in any other RTS game. Flanking attacks and finding defensible terrain are keys to victory, and breaking your enemy's units morale can turn the tide of battle.\n\nOn the downside, it requires a certain level of micromanagement, and if you don't keep an eye on your troops battles often become a cluster♥♥♥♥. Its resource system is also firmly in the early 2000s with multiple resources but only one that really matters. Gold is the only resource that one can have a stockpile of, and thus the management of other resources is to ideally have a minimum deficit with no surplus so that they do not impact your gold income. Still, it's a fun game and the ability to integrate independent towns and creeps into your army is something we're only very recently seeing come back in strategy games.","May 12, 2014","true","23.8"," 25 of 25 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","25","25","0","0"

Actually the Kohan series in its entirety is – it has a few components that are not truly replicated by any other current or past RTS games.  These are: simplified base/town management that allows town/settlement specialization, regimentation creation and customization, and simple, intuitive formations that greatly affect combat effectiveness and gameplay.  These elements make Kohan a unique and fantastic addition to any RTS player’s library.  If you were to mesh Warcraft with Rome: Total War you would end up with Kohan.  The game no longer has a huge online community but is certainly worth your $20.","July 21, 2013","true","17.9"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","22","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrath-/recommended/97130/","wrath-","Wrath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrath-/","145 products in account","Alright, let's tackle Kohan II.\n\nBy now, this game is pretty old but that's never bothered me for any game as long as it still runs – which it does. The music is pleasant, the graphics are still fine for me and resolution scales to 1920x1080. You have a number of different possible civilizations all with their unique personalities and playstyles. Despite its comically stiff voice acting, it's competitive in terms of real RTS elements and functionality.\n\nWhy is it still one of my favourites after all this time? Because it, like most games I really like, has something that none of the other ones do. In this case, it's tactics. Most especially at high levels, this game behaves completely different in terms of strategy because you have to be comfortable losing bases and relocating from place to place and rolling with the punches. This is unusual and enjoyable because of it, because when we take traditional Age of ___ titles or Command and Conquer titles, their gameplay is always built on having a single impenetrable base and zero to several forward bases. Therefore the goal is to destroy your opponent's super base and they lose. You always know where they are coming from and going to. Not here.\n\nIn Kohan II, your line of sight is very short and you have to actually think about what your opponent might be planning and where their troops are actively heading, flank them and/or catch another base off guard and let your enemies hang themselves. Because, while it is possible to have a super-well defended base with a home-field advantage, giant battles between two or more extreme armies are pointless and don't get anyone anywhere. Avoid those and it becomes a game you actually have to think about and therefore a true strategy game.\n\nRelevant to your interests: This may be a sequel to Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns, but it has nothing but theming and lore in common. The original Kohan is completely different. Also, multiplayer does not work because GameSpy, as you well know, has been dead for years. However, unlike to completely nonsensical Dungeon Siege II issues, you CAN actually do LAN games, which makes it O.K. for me.","October 22, 2015","true","5.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","6"

Very much a real time game, it incorporates popular fundamental elements of the genre as it's commonly defined such as base building, veterancy and key named hero units capable of having a pronounced effect on the tide of battle, but wheras highly regarded titles of a similar age and make such as WarCraft 3 and Command & Conquer lean more toward the tactical aspects of combat, Kohan II leans more toward the strategic elements by foregoing individual unit micromanagement and having orders issued at the command level: companies are composed of captains, front lines, flanks and support units, and you control their composition and formation; column formation affords greater movement speed, but leaves the company's flank and support units exposed, while attack formation places the frontline where it belongs and is crucial for making pushes into enemy territory, yet limits a company's movement speed in a forced march.\n\nAlthough units are smart enough to fight to their full potential when given sufficient orders, sometimes valor and good equipment can only go so far--Kohan II's scale of battle can become very large, and terrain plays a critical role in the flow of armies: open ground favors calvary, while heavily wooded areas shield men from arrows but limit their movement speed.  Impassable mountains and lakes can form bottlenecks where armies clash that result in grueling melees lasting minutes of real time or more.  And despite its fantasy elements--clerics, wizards, barbarians and more--there are witheringly realistic conditions: no mortal army, no matter how experienced or well led, can battle endlessly.  Prolonged combat takes a toll on morale and companies who have multiple wounded units may route, break formation and flee for safety in the face of tireless undead waves, who knowing neither fear nor mercy can march as ordered until they overwhelm their enemy or are ground into dust.  Lines of supply play an important part as well, with a visible indicator for your personal territory marking where your units can rest and recuperate and where they will flee if routed.  In keeping with their forlorn and ravenous nature, the forces of the dead need no such succor, their numbers replenishing almost constantly no matter how far from their decrepit forts their companies may be.\n\nThe story can be described as contemporary fantasy, with characters who fit the description of ignorant hero, righteous do-gooder, bitter scapegoat, wise advisor and eldritch madman.  Though the land of Khaldun has never been without its strife, a primordial evil threatens to consume everything, and though the heroes--unlikely and cynical as some of them may be--harness the might and the will to avert the end of the world, they do not do so without cost, illustrating the brutal lesson that noble victory sometimes requires sacrifice.\n\nSo, yeah, pretty good buy for $10.  Devote a weekend to this game, you won't regret it!","August 18, 2014","true","12.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

You play an intangible ruler and combine a Race (primarily responsible for unit and building diversity) and faction (responsible for statistical augmentation and a splash of unit variety). You then start in a fairly 4x-esque starting position: one lone city and a map full of darkness. From there, you explore, conquer new settlements, and amass an army that sweeps across the realm like a terrible inferno.\n\nThe big difference, however, is on a lack of micromanagement. In fact: you can't. Your units will select targets for their spells and attacks on their own. It's up to you to make strategic decisions, such as setting up flanks, calling for mass retreats, and developing your empire rather than clicking a spell button as fast as possible.","September 30, 2014","true","14.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The only virtue it has is to teach new players about the basics, the rest depends on the players to experiment with setups.\n\nThe skirmish/multiplayer has got insane amount of replayability due to the map generator and the plentiful faction/race combinations. The AI in this game is pretty meh, however, the custom AIs which are available at Chimaeros' website can teach a thing or two about resilience and suffering :)\n\nThe biggest thing going for this game is being insanely modable.

KIS is argurably my favorite game ever, so question is, does Kings of War actually succeed in its task?\n\nThe graphics are no longer based on sprites (which, though beautiful, are outdated) like KIS, but use actual threedimensional models, which any screenshot will reveal to you. These graphics are decent enough, and comparable to other games from its time (LOTR: Battle for Middle Earth, Rome: Total war), but graphics aren't timeless, and by todays standard they can be an eyesore to look at to some. Don't play this game for its graphics!\n\nAnother change from the original was the diversifying of different races. I like this, because it makes for interesting gameplay, playing your strengths to your advantage, exploiting your enemies weaknesses while attempting to prevent them from doing the same to you. However, while the game races are balanced once you get well into the game, a new player might feel like some races are unnecessarily powerful. Good to keep in mind if you pick this up without experience.\n\nThe combat is made to rely less on micromanagement and more on tactics/strategy. You command units in squads, which you compose yourself, and once they engage in combat you can only really tell them to run, the rest is up to them. There is a decent selection of abilities and passives the units have, giving quite some depth to composition of armies and individual squads. On top of this, heroes called Kohans, the game's namesake, can be added to squads, and will contribute with buffs, spells, tactical advantages or just pure physical prowess. On top of all this, squads can level up, growing in strength, and Kohans can even gain stronger versions of their spells.\n\nEconomy is another step away from micromanagement, with only one true resource. Gold will accumulate in your tresury when you have town collecting taxes, or exporting other "raw resources". The raw resources, stone, wood, iron and mana, are simply a means to and end. They do not accumulate, and you simply have yields (+), for example from a woodmill or warehouse, or you have a decline (-), by maybe exporting a resource, or needing it for your troops. Those combined give you a net combined suprulus or deficit. A surpulus gives you nothing, but a deficit means you have to pay a part of your gold income to sustain whatever outputs you use the resource for. This means a net 0 of all resources means maximum efficiency.\n\nOh right, and the story is essentially just there to provide stuffing for the lore. The game is designed as a multiplayer experience, with custom games being the feature. While KIS and its expansion provided a generic but decent enough story with somewhat varied missions and maps to warrant me two playthroughs, I see no point in completing this one, and I don't intend to. If you pick this game up, a great plus is to have someone to play with, even though the AI is decent enough. Gameranger supports this game, if you want to play it multiplayer.\n\nMy personal pet peeves with this game is that the buildings producing resources are weirdly balanced. While in KIS, a standard woodmill would produce 6 wood, and upgraded would produce either 4 wood more (10 total) or sell 5 wood for 10 gold (1 wood 10 gold/min total). This meant you could either increase production (more raw resources), or increase export (more gold), but not both, meaning you had to balance it, getting more resources if you had an deficit or selling if you had a surpulus. In this game (Kings of War) most upgrades that increase gold gain (exports) produce more gold than the resources you are selling should. This means, that éven if you're in debt over resources, selling them produces the money to compensate for buying them and some more. There is literally NEVER a reason to build some buildings over others.\n\nTL;DR I love this game, but I know that it's old and a lot of people wouldn't appreciate it. I still prefer KIS over this, but it's a close match. If you are interested in a more pure tactical/strategical experience, without all the micromanagement of modern RTS, but still looking for a somewhat fast RTS game, this is probably as good as it gets.","September 6, 2015","true","36.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Kohan has unique qualities that I haven't seen in other strategy games which make it fresh and exciting despite being over a decade old.  You can customise your companies with troop types to complement your strategy, add heroes to groups making them more powerful and adding to a company's versatility.  The combat system involves placement of troops in positions to gain advantages.  You can actually outflank and wreak havoc from the sides or behind.\n\nResource management, find and hold on to resources to gain the bonuses.  Build a fort near them to help defend.   Capture nuetral cities and then gain the ability to produce their troop types.\n\nI love strategy games and this series has always stuck in my head as a fantasticly created masterpiece.  I would LOVE to see a Kohan III with improved graphics and some new elements.  Not sure if Timegate is still in business but if you are out there, start up a Kickstarter or something, you've got my support!","November 9, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a number of unique elements to the Kohan series and Kohan II that I have never seen anywhere else, and this isn't because they suck.  Be it the regimental formations or the race/faction combination, or many other unique elements, they work.  Personally I quickly become bored with CoC or Age of _______, but I can still remember some of the truly epic battles I have had in the past playing Kohan.  Some of the features may seem odd or ill thought to those unfamiliar with them, but they aren't.  I highly recommend this game for anyone who loves strategy and tactical games.","November 12, 2015","true","87.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With undead and a lot of heroes, you might want to spam zombies to get all the heroes on the field as zombies have no upkeep.  With undead you can get 5 troops per second level city, and 9 zombies plus a builder (with 9 heroes) is pretty much unbeatable in the early game.\n\nGame consists of finding place to build a village (there are about 28 places on a big map) and then upgrading to support the upkeep of various troops.  Each village, regardless of the size can produce: rock, wood, iron, gold, or mana.  Also depending on what you have built, you are then qualified to build certain troops from that village.  But even if you can build it, unless you have enough well developed villages, the upkeep will weigh you down.\n\nThere is a subtle balance between creating wealth so you can build and upgrade, and fielding troops so you can conquer and protect.  That's why engineers and zombies with their low upkeep, are so effective and will usually allow you to develop an economic engine way beyond your opponents and you can just steam roll them by the end.\n\nOnce you get the hang of it, each game takes about 2 hours on the biggest map with the most number (8) AI opponents.\n7 different races.","April 24","true","215.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
