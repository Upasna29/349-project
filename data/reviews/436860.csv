Okay, so maybe it's not in quite the same league as Deadly Premonition - since that one was wilfully weird and this one is, for the most part, just bafflingly incompetent - but there's far more to this mystery than a quick glimpse of the Store page can possibly communicate.  Let me first attempt to explain the "gameplay" and/or "story" to you...\n\nIn Arctic alive (capital A, small A), you play a borderline-emotionless, quite possibly "bipolar" woman who needs constant anti-depressants to cope with the curious predicament she finds herself in, and is so inconsolable in her isolated loneliness that she chooses to die of hypothermia rather than try on a BLOUSE (!) which she finds in a hallway closet.  Serves her right, really, for being in the arctic wearing a skimpy, skin-tight black latex costume, but I guess it DOES make her look all Jennifer Lopez from behind.  I mean, you've gotta get your priorities straight, even in a desperate life-or-death situation, am I right?\n\nAnyway, so little Ms Sexy Bottom awakens, without any explanation, in a small cage-like partition of a room which is presumably meant to serve as her prison cell, in spite of the fact that the fence of said cage ends about two-thirds of the way up to the ceiling and her captors have generously provided her with a chair to easily hop over it.  First brain-bending puzzle...CONQUERED!  The next puzzle is HOW TO PUT AWAY A MAP OR NOTE after you pick it up to look at it.  The only method I found for getting said items out of my hands and into my inventory was to use one of the food or medicinal items already in said inventory...fortunately, my survive-o-meter for hunger is already dropping, so it's not a complete waste, and speaking of such meters...did I mention there's one with the symbol of a TOILET?!  I unfortunately didn't get far enough into the game to explore how THAT particular game mechanic works, but I'm sure it's a bit of an eye-opener (then again, she "eats" by just pushing foodstuffs in front of her face, whereupon they just magically disappear with a munching sound, so perhaps she goes potty in an equally visually - alas, not aurally! - petite manner).\n\nIn any case, she soon enough enters a corridor where a spooky figure forms out of a black puddle on the ground, before promptly proceeding to walk up and snap her neck.  No weapon in her hand yet, and no expression on her face as she dies such a horrible death.  As I alluded to above, I think she WANTS to die.  But just in case you don't share her feelings, searching a different area before braving this one will find you a note which suggests that you should stay still when he's looking at you, and herein lies one of the game's few genuinely creepy features...as it's very surreal indeed to stand perfectly still while Mr Red Eyes walks straight up to you and stares you in the face, practically DARING you to move so much as a muscle, before casually strolling on.  It's quite an effective touch, really...made all the more surreal by the fact that you're quite possibly SNEEZING ("a-choo!") from imminent hypothermia as he does so.  Though I did eventually find the whole trying-to-make-some-progress-without-him-noticing shtick so borderline impossible that I eventually just RAN straight for the nearest door, because wouldn't you know it...Mr Red Eyes can't follow you through doors.  Thank ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ for that, or I wouldn't have even made it to the sixth or seventh room in the game.\n\nI managed to achieve a few other things in the short time that I humoured this - let us be kind and say somewhat "under-developed" - product.  I managed to turn off a generator (to what effect I'm not sure, but hey, it IS a horror-adventure game), and I also managed to pick up a whole tonne of other possibly useful stuff, but alas...no weapon and no useable toilets.  Oh, and if you see a black puddle of goo which DOESN'T instantly morph into an obsidian-black gent with red eyes, I wouldn't advise trying to walk over it, as it insta-kills you for absolutely no apparent reason.\n\nNow, the Store page eloquently describes this as "a simulator with elements of survival horror".  It doesn't tell us WHAT it's a simulator of, and as for "elements" of survival horror...well, call me crazy, but I'm not sure having your neck snapped by a supernatural entity multiple times in the first ten minutes of gameplay exactly qualifies as the "simulator" component of the game's description (unless it's meant to be a "getting-your-neck-snapped-by-supernatural-entities" simulator, in which case, it is most assuredly the quintessential game of its type).  But wait, I still haven't mentioned the single most curious aspect of this game, which is...\n\nDespite the fact that this game bears almost all the hallmarks of a cheaply-made, unimaginatively-whipped-up horror game made on an engine like Unity or Unreal, it ISN'T a first-person game, and it ACTUALLY DOES LOOK LIKE all the rather spiffy screenshots and videos on the Store page!  So this presumably WASN'T made by someone who has no idea about either good gameplay OR coding...as they'd actually appear to know a little about the latter!  So if Dima Kiva ever learns anything about, y'know, logical storytelling and workable gameplay mechanics, he or she may actually be capable of making a COMPETENT game one day!\n\nIt's certainly been a surreal experience, I can tell you that.  I'm used to horror games these days being either really excellent, kinda decent, or just flat-out steaming DOG-♥♥♥♥♥.  This is none of those things.  It's closer to the kind of bog-standard incompetence you might have expected YEARS ago, before anyone had heard of things like Steam Greenlight, for example.  Which is to say...it COULD almost pass for "professional" product, at least until you actually make the mistake of PLAYING the ♥♥♥♥ing thing.  From that point onward, the cat is most definitely out of the bag, hissing and feral and ready to claw your face clean off.  Who knows, maybe this will even be knocked into some kind of shape which one could deem vaguely "playable" sometime in the future?  Stranger things have happened.  In the meantime, I shall be sure to hold my breath until I'm as blue in the face as a victim of, well, hypothermia (bear with me here, trying my best to remain topical)...\n\nVerdict: 4/10.","January 29","false","1.1"," 91 of 132 people (69%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","69","91","132","51","15"

It is a survival game (like Rust or ARK without the building aspect), with survival horror elements as well. Graphically I like the visual style, some people may not. I suppose it all comes down to personal preference. I have not made it too far yet, but hopefully I can figure out some of the other mechanics of the game and get more into it.

But in its current form, absolutely not worth it.\n\nOkay, so the English is a little shaky.  But I'm intrigued by this game.  You're in an Artic outpost and your task is to survive.  And then...came....the bugs.\n\nIt's a problem that I can't put the diary page down.  You find it, you read it....and then you're carrying it in front of your face for the rest of whatever.  The problem is, you can't interact with any other objects when you have the diary page in front of your face.  And you have to choose -- do you want to read the diary and then doom the rest of your game to nothing?  Or not read the diary and therefore miss some probable relevant information?\n\nThe interface is rusty, I can't figure out how to plant seeds, water them, and grow them.  And then there's the enemy -- the black blog that morphs into the form of a human who quickly snaps your neck.  But I am compelled to play this game!\n\nI don't know what it is -- the environment isn't particularly interesting -- it's like the movie "The Thing" without any supporting cast.  And yet, the concept is alluring -- how am I going to survive in the Artic?\n\nSo here's the deal -- DEVELOPER, fix the bugs and I will return.  You have something intriguing here.\n","February 6","false","0.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mahulabrosinc/recommended/436860/","mahulabrosinc","Mahula Bros Inc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mahulabrosinc/","235 products in account","I've been playing this game for a short while as a series for my YT channel.\n\nFirst, it does have some minor bugs that I'll overlook. I kinda like the twitching shadow monsters.\n\nSecond, there needs to be a tutuorial to teach you certain things about the game mechanics. The badly translated diary pages don't help. G-translate could've done a better job. Everything you need is in the game but it's not a "simulation" game if I have to figure out how to change my clothes. Or that the game makes you think the heroine needs an antidepresant prescription.\n\nThird, stealth is there. I kinda like it but it could've been better.\n\nForth, the story is weak. I watched the trailer after playing the game for 6hrs. Now, i don't want to play because the supposed goal is in the trailer and now i'm not interested in the ending of the game. I'll do it for my viewers but there needs to be an explanation for English speakers to understand.\n\nI am very impressed with the survival/simulation aspect of the game. Very in depth and involved. Gotta stay warm and fed and use the bathroom. Get some sleep. That's all good. I'll give a tip to all you players. You don't need antidepresants. Just a hot bath, clean clothes, a nap, food/water, a good evac, maybe play some tunes and you'll be a happy camper.\n\nI cannot recommend this game in it's current state. In my not-so humble opinion, this game is still in alpha. Biggest reason is for the less than poorly translated texts. Next, the weak story, which could be attributed to the bad translation. Third, would be the lack of tutorial for a non-user-friendly simulation/survival system. This can also be attributed to the bad translation because I've noticed now, some of the text is suposed to be instructions and hints. It took me a while to figure out what was being said about the bears. My biggest complaint is not that you have to find warmer clothes... just that it took me a day of real time to figure out how to change my clothes.\n\nOK. I'm done. I will finish this game because it seems that my viewers want it. This is a skeleton of a potentially good game.","February 8","false","8.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","0"
