Carmageddon spiced up by the ability to smack the living ♥♥♥♥ out of your opponents while you're on foot. Great soundtrack. Charismatic Liddy, boss of the Company - the gang our protagonist joins in the beginning. Rant singing Kumbaya. Four rival gangs - each with their own flavor. And all of these set in a pretty good-looking post-apocalyptic wasteland.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZachFett/recommended/328460/","ZachFett","Zach Fett","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZachFett/","897 products in account","It was a great game, however it has a lot of technical issues and I can't recommend you buy it. The Steam version is the same as the one on GOG, so don't expect that one to be any different. Both are at version 1.1 (the menu will say 1.0, this has always been the case, the patch never changed that number, so ignore it, and ignore all the people in the forum thinking they have to install the patch. That does nothing.)\n\nThe game's level design is pretty bad, but otherwise it was a fun FPS that also had decent car combat (and every car had an interior camera view!). It was fun blowing up bad guys into red chunks, and the way your weapon would transform into different versions was very cool. The animation for turning your assault rifle into a buzzsaw or sniper rifle was always entertaining.\n\nSadly, as I said, the game has a ton of issues currently. I was able to get it running on Windows 10 (though a lot of people in the forum can't get it to run at all. I did nothing special, so I have no idea why others are having issues getting it to launch), however you cannot change the resolution any higher than 1280x1024, the framerate is capped at 30fps, there's no way to increase the extremely small FOV, and if you use one of the fanmade patches to get a higher resolution (I was able to get it to launch at 1920x1080) the game will not run through Steam. Hence why it says I've only put a handful of minutes in the game.\n\nAmong other smaller issues is that the mouse will go wonky in some menus, slowing to a stuttering crawl, making it very hard to change keybindings and graphic settings. The soundtrack is screwed up and every single level starts with the same loud song (track02, which you can find under the Bonus Content folder), which plays for about 2 minutes and then stops. It doesn't play any of the other 8 songs this game has, it doesn't loop that one song, it just.. stops.\n\nThat one song will begin playing once a cutscene starts, too, so if you haven't turned it off (it's the "CD Audio" setting) then you'll have an impossible time trying to hear any of the characters.\n\nIf you don't mind playing with no music, a tiny resolution, mouse issues, and the often crashes, then it's a fun game. The level design is, as I said, kind of awful, and you'll get lost a good bit of the time. But the weapons are fun, the vehicles handle nicely, each one has an interior view, and the characters are pretty goofy and entertaining, especially whoever voiced Bork. Goodness, that voice.\n\nAnyway, I can't recommend it, it's too buggy. Not even for the $0.97 it's currently at. I hope that this game sooner or later gets an official patch to fix at least a handful of the issues I've mentioned, but until then just play something else. You aren't missing too much. This is an entertaining, but altogether forgettable game.\n\nIf you really need some Redline in your life, why not just listen to some good ol' King Kobra?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrjpsjLntm0","March 15","false","0.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

And there's a horrid clipping glitch, where textures are all over the place and covers most of the screen. Also, about 10% of the time, the game crashes immediately after starting. I contacted Retroism, the company that owns this game, and they said running it in compatibility mode for Windows 98/Windows Me has fixed lag for SOME people, so if you're having issues, that's worth a try. It didn't help with me though, and unfortunately I'm not alone. I also tried compatibility mode for Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8 with no luck.\n\nFor Win10: The game will not open, period. A popup comes up and it say "Wheels has stopped." Windows 10 isn't optimized to play most old games though, so be careful what you buy.\n\nI don't blame the devs though, it's not their fault. Old games like this are meant to be played on older softwares. I'm sure this game is badass though, I didn't refund it (I got it on sale for $1, that's actually how I heard of Redline), and I hope to eventually see a fix!","March 15","false","0.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Both the fps and the combat driving elements control great and feel good. But I strongly recommend remapping the controls. The first 9 levels (out of 12) are well designed and the combat works well. The gameplay in these levels are well paced with proper incrementing difficulty. But the last three levels of the game are very glitchy and overly difficult (which is not retroism or night dive's fault). I spent a few hours trying to finish the last three levels due to saving and door glitches, as well as the overly difficult level Area 51 (the part with the aliens). The first nine levels alone are worth playing and worth the money. I would welcome a reboot. 8/10","August 10, 2015","true","9.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I am reviewing the game for what it is, ignoring that gouging price tag completely. There are 99 cent games with more replayability and fun than Redline, even a skin on Dota 2 would net you more joy than this***\n\nRedline is probably the greatest game to have come out on January 1st, 1999.\n\nYou drive cars with physics that are neck-breaking at best, but they have more variety and challenge to them than Borderlands has ever offered. The gunplay is absolutely terrible, with one-gun-fitting-all and very little use for the sniper rifle... Or machine gun, or grenades, or the saw-thing, but ya kinda end up using all of them at one point or another. It's a little hard, even for a seasoned FPS veteran, and I'd stay away if you weren't playing for the nostalgia value, but\n\nat the end of the day, it's something to play on a rainy day, and it's a small challenge. I probably won't ever even end up finishing it, it's got 20 missions too many, is terribly linear, but if you want to see what good car firefights are, go no further than this game.","November 16, 2014","true","3.9"," 15 of 32 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","15","32","2","0"

They actually intrigued me , makes me want to learn more about this post apocalyptic wastland, but sadly, after all those missions , things just start to turn bad,the difficulty curve of this game suddenly runs sky high, forcing me to use cheats to beat this game, and all the plot just stop here,there's no more new things,the only last thing i remember is somebody in our company is a traitor and that's it ! After that you just kill this, kill that and nothing happens! All you're doing is killing people for no reasons!\n\nAnd don't even metion that those missions are so unfair, some of them even fills with game-breaking bugs !!! What makes me angrier is that every time you died your boss will mock on you,like he didn't give a ♥♥♥♥ and he can always do better than you...seriously,WTF? If i was the protagonist i will go back and quit my job with a bullet pop in his head.\n\nAt the end of the day,Redline is a meh game at best,it got shallow to none story, ridiculous difficlty curve at the second half of the missions,and some really bad controls, so , do you need to grab this game now?Definitley no,but as for the sale,for the sake of the first half missions, well you can get this game for a 50% off sale,i assure you this is the fair price for this game.\n\nEDIT : People start to unvote this honest review made by someone who actually FINISHED the game, it just sad...anyway, google it, you'll find there's NOT a single person had complete this game on Youtube without cheat or exploit the game bugs!!! Because it really ♥♥♥♥ing HARD on the later stage! Grab a pirate one and see for yourself !
