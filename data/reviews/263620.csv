This is a game you would play while taking a break from another similar "main" game. Some people would prefer to play a different game, but I don't know. Juggling a plethora of games that represent dozens of different genres would turn anybody's brain into stale yogurt. Why take the risk when you can play something similar that's stil entertaining?\n\nThis game - which I'll refer to as MKH because acronyms are fun (AAF) - falls under the genre of arena-slasher. Typically a character-action game has some mode where you fight wave after wave of enemies (Bloody Palace, Lost Chapter, Tests of Valor).  When a character-action game is literally just that wave-based mode, it becomes an arena-slasher. These are pretty rare and tend to be doujin titles, like Croixleur Sigma (also available on Steam).\n\nThe plot to MKH is: woman kills stuff with katana. Each of the five chapters are divided into five waves. Enemies are rich in number but poor in identity. There are guys with swords, red guys with swords, yellow guys with swords, big guys with swords, robots, an evil schoolgirl, and maybe 1 or 2 other different types of enemies. However, this is a short game, one that you can slash through in less than two hours.\n\nNot-evil schoolgirl (I already forgot her name) has a sweet sword and not much else when you start off. Upgrades can be purchased as well as new moves and powers. The #1 thing to keep in mind throughout is parrying. While it's easy to mash the attack button and slice evil to pieces, playing defensively is how you avoid getting your combos broken. More specifically, it's all about the parry. Blocking is fine, but it doesn't work on heavy attacks and tends to get broken by a continous assault. Timing the block just right allows NES to awesome her way through the enemy's attack and deliver a strong counter-move.\n\nThere are other tactics to keep in mind. When an enemy is struck enough times they'll start to bleed (turn red). At this point a few more hits are liable to kill the enemy, just before they die the player should sheathe their weapon. It's like that common Japanese maneuver where the samurai cuts a dozen people at once, but they only fall over and die after the sword's been sheathed. In this game it's just something you want to do to boost your skill-points & regain health, though it also does big damage to bosses. There are other abilities and skills to master, but it's better to get a feel for it while playing the game.\n\nFor the most part, MKH is a breezy entertaining slasher. It's satisfying getting those big combos while also deflecting numerous attacks coming from every angle. Keeping track of the action can be difficult though, and your sound has to be turned up to notice the enemies that inevitably attack from behind. Some more variety in the enemies and bosses would have been appreciated, but maybe it's just me. I've been playing Bayonetta 2 and it seems like every 10 minutes there's a new enemy to fight. Like I said though, MKH is a short game. 10 minutes in that game is at least 3 or 4 waves. New enemy-types would just get lost in the chaos.\n\nUnlike the games it serves a supplementary role to, MKH can be enjoyed even if you only have 5 minutes of free-time. There's no sitting through cut-scenes or loading, nor does it take several minutes to get the action. It's also possible to save in-between waves, and you certainly aren't expected to play through the whole thing without dying. Start this game up, slash through a few waves, and put it down so you can focus on your main title.\n\nAll in all, this is a worthwhile pick-up.","October 26, 2014","true","2.9"," 96 of 111 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","96","111","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rakuraiji/recommended/263620/","rakuraiji","Rakuraiji","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rakuraiji/","492 products in account","This game! What should I say? I don' know.. It's good. Somehow.\nBut 10€? I'd rather wait till you can get it for 5$/€.\n\nThe game itself has some neat graphics, as you can see in the trailer/ screenshots, it has a nice soundtrack, really accurate controls and cool gameplay.\n\nAs for:\n- the graphic: sure is nice, no doubt - especially for a game with not even 300MB in size. The downside is that, if you want some variety, you'll be disappointed. There are only 4 different enemy models (+4/5 bosses) and 4 arenas. Your attacks look nice, but nothing overwhelming or new. If you watched the trailer you've seen quite everything. Also you cant alternate your character. At all (Okay. There are only 2 costumes you can buy, but that's it)\n(also there are no lip-sync in cut scenes)\n\n- the soundtrack: more like the 3 songs. The music fits really good. But: The game contains, as far as i noticed it, like 3 different tracks (normal fight, boss battle and final boss) which will loop endlessly. Again: some more variety sure would have been nice.\n\n- the controls:  simple, yet very effective controls! Your character responds immediately and with a few buttons you can chain your attacks together to devastating combos.\n\n- the gameplay: All in all... Sadly quite repetitive. It IS a fun game, no doubt. But it feels incomplete. It feels more like a tech demo for a fighting system. You simply fight wave after wave of enemies within a circle shaped arena which you can't leave, fall/ throw enemies off or use any objects/ items.\nAfter like 5 waves you fight a boss of this arena. The bosses usually are have easy to memorize and clearly predictable attacks. That's somehow good since it won't get frustrating at all. But on the other hand it sadly makes the boss battles far too easy.\nYou start with a weak 4 hit combo attack which fills up your "katana gauge". Each attack (you don't even have to land a hit) with your katana drains a bit of it. So you'll have to chain together weaker and stronger attacks to not run out of it completely (side note: there are no other penalties to an empty katana gauge other then not being able to use the katana. Also this system gets completely pointless once you've upgraded your character a bit. I never had the slightest problem with running low on katana energy.)\nEvery killed opponent drops more or less "SP" which is the 'money' for buying upgrades for your character. You can buy a few attacks, upgrade every attack to deal more damage or have extra effects and upgrade your health (+regeneration) and your katana gauge (+regeneration).\n\nIn conclusion I'd really love to see this fighting game, or rather "fighting system", to be developed further and put into an open world, or at least bigger action adventure game with more skills and a bigger variety of attacks/ combos.\nIf you can live with a bit repetitive, short arena fighting game, you'll sure have fun with this. If you want this game and are patient: wait till it has a bigger discount!\n\n\n(On a side note: If you're planing to play on "Hard" mode right from the beginning: that's pure suicide. You won't stand any chance. You'll HAVE to do a play through on normal or easy to unlock some power ups so you stand a chance on hard)","March 11, 2014","true","5.9"," 174 of 233 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","174","233","0","1"

Even for pantsu shots for those kind of people ;P\n\ntraining exercise is handy if you're new or rubbish beat 'em up games. leveling up your character is simply done, just get high enough combo and kill your enemy for maximum points. The background music suits the fast past of the game.\n\nThe problem I had though is that the enemies attacks are slow and predictable even on hard mode, I shoundn't be able to get a 200 combo chain on an enemy just by ONLY kicking them up in the air while his teamates are in the background making thier swords....sorry I mean sticks (when they hit you, it's like they attack you with a pillow)...shine brighter. A nightmare mode should fix this.  The story also needs to be deeper, in these games, a story usually has a big role, but here, I'm more like "Who are? Why should I care? Let me see your whities!" With also only 200Mb size, I'm guessing the game will be very short which will be a shame.\n\nBesides that, the short amount of time I played, it is really inresting and fun game that its combat system makes a worth buy.\nLike come!

It also has an upgrade system and you want to upgrade health first, Trust me! Getting started with the game is hard, because it doesn't explain you that much. You have to try everything on your own and learn how it works. If you are done with learning, you will see how you block attacks from enemies. How you are beating a large amount of enemies with no problems, and then the game starts to show you all of its potential and fun.

A few costumes, no additional characters, throwaway abilities and letdown upgrades.\n-Very repetitive. Hit almost identical enemies all day long.\n-Bad AI. Enemies behave strange and are often dumb beyond belief.\n-Very small space to actually move around, limited to only small circles that you fight on.\n-Lack of graphic and resolution options. Most resolution selections are missing, making it awkward if you happen to not find your native one.\n\nThe good:\n-Rather small file size.\n-Graphics aren’t really all that great, but they are appealing enough to look at.\n-It can be pretty fun to hack and slash around at the enemies, even though it can get old fast.\n-Bosses are decently fun, even if they are rather weirdly and simply designed.\n-Good for short play-sessions.\n\nIn general, this is a game that is hard to recommend to anyone. It is nice to have Japanese indie titles coming out on Steam, and for some people supporting that might be enough. For everyone else, with the lack of proper options, replay value, as well as having barely any content, there is probably not enough here if you don’t mind a very simple game that is mostly only good for a short burst of dumb (and sadly unpolished) fun.\n\nEDIT: I usually try to stay away from writing my own opinion about something like this, but there have been too many people writing me and defending the game that I have to add a little bit of my more detailed personal opinion about how people treat such games. After playing for a few more hours, I can't imagine why people would defend this game. Even for the low price they are asking, you are practically getting a hack n' slash with terrible and imprecise gameplay, no variety in combat nor enemies, no story and annoying cutscene, bad graphics, bugs, and just no quality or content whatsoever. Not to forget that it's basically 2 hours long at best. Forgetting all of that, every time I check what people have good to say about it they just write something like "dude those pantsu" and think that makes it right. If that's the way people think nowadays, and they will let a game with no content and terrible quality slide and even defend it just because it has a main character in a miniskirt, then I am sorry for anyone that is stepping to such low levels. Come on guys. That’s just pitiful and sickening. Let's look for quality over cheap sexualization and similar gimmicks that producers try to sell a game with.","March 12, 2014","false","2.5"," 128 of 180 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","128","180","0","3"

Boohoo, I have 21.2 hours on record, and I purchased all the upgrades. You get many SP from getting many hits without getting hit, and the higher difficulties (Hard, Very Hard, and Inferno) are unexpectedly helpful for racking up SP. You just can't dodge worth a damn, learn to dodge.\n\n- "Stupid enemies, they won't do a thing." Lol try harder difficulties. But then again, with that dodging "skill", you won't survive a minute.\n\n- "Insanely difficult bosses with unblockable and/or can't-be-dodged moves, and difficult patterns requiring a lot of time to understand." If you can't block it, use Counter. If you can't Counter it, use Flourish. If you can't Flourish it, dodge it. You can avoid getting hit by every bosses' moves with any of the four. Learn to. Their patterns are not that difficult, unless you don't have the patience.\n\n- "Generic enemies." Lol many AAA titles have them too. I don't see you complaining over them.\n\n- "Generic levels, with no uniques or puzzles." Depends on how one defines puzzle, but in a general sense, lol who looks for puzzles in a hack and slash game?\n\nAny other aspects are subjective and therefore isn't enough to make this game deserve its bad reviews.\n\nI highly recommend this game to any gamers who have the willingness and patience to learn playing it properly.","May 8","true","21.7"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","32","40","4","0"

In this anime style game you will find your self fighting what seems to be endless waves of enemy’s to save your classmate who is processed. Can you handle it?\n\nGameplay: 7\n\nThe game is button smashing after button smashing goodness. You fight what seems to be endless waves of robots from normal human size to more bigger and beefier guys. While playing you have accuses to combo moves that allows you to spice up the combat by performing much crazier attacks. While having a stamina bar to use special ability’s. To gain more ability's you will need to earn SP to use to unlock other ability's. You gain SP by killing off enemy’s. The game come with mutable unlocks from harder difficulty, to unlocking costumes and such. This game will kick your ♥♥♥ and take your name if your not careful. This game will get harder as you go. You are able to use the keyboard to play but however I DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT recommend this. Do your self a favorite and get a game controller. Even with a game controller your hands will hate you after playing this game.\n\nThe game play while being very solid can very repetitive in what you do. There isn't many different kinds of enemy's to fight. While playing, the game can suffer from slow downs with all the action going on. Every level is pretty much the same circle arena where you fight with just a different background. So you'll find your self playing in a circle arena from the start to the end of the game. However a lot of these are just minor problems.\n\nStory: 5\n\nYou are in control of Misa, a blade Templar who is looking for a weapon that holds the powers of demons. One of your class mates ends up with the sword and becomes processed by it's power. You are hunting her down in hopes of saving them. The story is pretty basic but makes up in it's game play.\n\nMusic: 6\n\nThe music is in this game is pretty good. It's has a nice rock and techno sound to the music. It does a good job in keeping you in the mood of the game. While the soundtrack may not be for everyone I wouldn't mind owning the soundtrack to this game.\n\nGraphics: 8\n\nThe graphics for this game is more of an realistic anime style rather than the cute and bright colors of a lot of anime style games you see out there. Some people will argue that this game is for horny guys or for fan service for having a lot of up skirt panty moments but don't let this get to you(unless you want. I mean Hey who doesn't like up skirt shots of anime girls? Anyone? Anyone?). While stated above that the game can slow down at times due to a lot of things going on at once. Each level has there own look and style to them. While the enemy's have different colors to show there toughness. Over all it's visually pleasing.\n\nFinal Though:\n\nBeing a fan of hack'n'slash games for years. When I found this game I didn't think I was going to enjoy it as much as I did. I loved the game so much that I played it on all settings and unlocked everything I could. But man my hands hurt for days even after I stopped playing. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who are fans of hack'n'slash games like dynasty warriors. This game was so much fun and pleasing to me.\n\nFinal score: 7\n\nVist my tumblr for more reviews, and other fun stuff. www.rogue32807.tumblr.com","March 6, 2015","true","1.8"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

After reading numerous comments and reviews about MKH, I decided to give it a try - and was really happy to get a chance to play through it.\n\nIf you enjoy Japanese-themed swordsmanship with challenging technical mechanics, fighting mobs of enemies, and grinding for upgrade systems, then you will really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are fantastic - the detail in the different character models is very good, and the fighting special effects is well-done. The music and sounds are great, adding a high level of intensity to the brutal, fast-paced gameplay. The cutscenes are short but sweet, and add an anime-like feel to the narrative. Although fairly basic, the story is decent enough to keep you interested in the plot (although the fighting mechanic definitely is the shining gem for this game).\n\nThe controls can be challenging to learn - especially if you do not use a controller. The move list and tutorials are helpful, however, the default keybindings make keyboard play unnecessarily difficult. That being said, I completed several playthroughs without a controller (I will be attempting to complete it on the hardest difficulty with a controller, since keyboard play is far too brutal), so it is possible if you have no alternative. The learning curve is moderate to challenging because the later stages (and higher difficulties) really require you to utilize more advanced moves - like countering and parrying. If you cannot do this in the later levels (and/or difficulties), you will not get very far.\n\nEach "level" consists of multiple waves, followed by a boss fight. Every enemy type follows a particular attack pattern that you can memorize and use to your advantage, adjusting your playstyle accordingly. For each kill you make, enemies may drop health or experienc orbs - experience is added to your total pool, which can then be used in the abilities store (you can access this at any time by pressing ESC).\n\nThere are a variety of things you can unlock and upgrade - in particular, improving your health and "katana energy" gauge (used to perform moves with your sword) is crucial to survival and chaining more combos. Improving your normal attacks will allow you to do more damage, refill more of your energy bar (hand-to-hand attacks refill your energy), and increase attack range, among a multitude of other things. You can also unlock a deadly counterattack, which is essential for defeating higher-tier enemies, and even bosses. Special attacks can also be unlocked and improved, however, it is entirely possible to complete at least one playhrough without further enhancing these things (it will just make it more difficult).\n\nFor achievement hunters, it can be both very fun and very lengthy to unlock every achievement in the game.\n\nOverall, the game is a lot of fun, and technical players will appreciate the depth of the possible fighting controls and combinations. Definitely give this game a try.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","October 5, 2014","true","4.0"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","20","28","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DevoidLeaf/recommended/263620/","DevoidLeaf","MajesticVoid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DevoidLeaf/","809 products in account","In short, this game is a generic hack and slash. It doesn't even try to hide it, the levels are arena like in nature, and enemies teleport into the arena and waves. (which begs the question, why not just all attack at once?) Typically, I'm a fan of these kinds of games, I enjoy the fast paced combat that they offer and the quick thinking required, and as much as I wanted to like this game, too many things kept me from my eventual ragequit (yes, I'll admit it, I ragequit). To start with, the combat itself is fairly bland, with very few in the terms of combos or special attacks, it boils down to alternating between mashing two different buttons however you feel like it. Combos are not based on a length of time, but rather how many hits you can get it in before you get hit. This isn't so much a downside as it is a personal preference; combos are more challenging and more entertaining when there's a time limit attached to them, to keep you in the fight for as long as possible. Some of the controls feel unintuitive, such as moving the control stick in any direction to use your directional attacks rather than your standard ones (this could be just me, as by habit I move towards what I'm attacking). The camera is sloppy, it positions itself how it feels and makes you have to constantly tweak it in order to watch out for attacks from other enemies, making it feel like you're playing two games at once, one that involves mashing buttons, and the other that involves photographing group pictures. While not particularly a downside, the amount of fanservice tends to be a bit much.\n\nIn short, its not the game for me, but someone out there is bound to enjoy it.","August 13, 2014","false","0.7"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

Certainly do not go into this game expecting Devil May Cry or Bayoneta.\n\nThe graphics are not outstanding, but they're servicable and a lot better than I'd expect from most Indie developers working with 3D.\n\nThe combat arenas are not very diverse, in that they're all the same, a giant circle with a number of different background locations to add a feeling of progress, but in a way that helps the game. You'll never find yourself fighting with bad level design, and the format of a pure circle is perfect for what the game is all about, pure unadulterated combat.\n\nThe AI of the game has a mild Platinum touch, specifically that enemies will not attack you if they are not onscreen, a trademark of Character Action games from the Japanese developers Platinum Games.\nOtherwise AI has a problem in that all enemies follow the same movement pattern, that is they walk towards you in as straight a line as possible, then start to circle you once they reach a certain proximity. This leads to a problem where if you run away for enough time, all the enemies bunch up into one big clump, which is a problem as you are either looking at all the enemies, or none of them, making you either in for a real pounding from every enemy or completely safe.\n\nEnemies have plenty of variety, starting off with basic faceless soldiers, then getting two Elite variants, then the introduction of more enemies that also get more complex and tough Elite variants. This leads to there being plenty combinations of enemies to keep combat interesting, you won't find yourself fighting the same encounter over and over.\n\nThe game is entirely devoid of a soundtrack, which does ruin the atmosphere a little, but perhaps no OST is better than a really bad one as is common with Indie Games.\n\nThe story is barebones and merely there to facilitate the existence of combat.\n\nThe game is very short, I have clocked in about 2.3 hours as of writing this, and I believe myself to be struggling with the last boss of the game. Though I am at the end of the story, the existence of an upgrade path, and I believe a New Game Plus type feature, in addition to the game's difficulty and pure focus on combat gives it a decent amount of replayablity.\n\nRegarding difficulty, I have played the game on both Easy and Normal difficulty, I've found the game pretty challenging and enjoyable without being too frustrating, even on Easy difficulty. Bosses are somewhat reminiscent of Dark Souls, they feature large swings, and a somewhat difficult to predict movesets. Will the boss swing once and leave themselves open for a punish? Or will me attempting to punsih their swing cause me to eat a second swing? These are the kind of things you'll have to cope with if choose to play this game.\n\nOn the whole I definately recommend this game for action fans, so long as they're fine with playing something with little to no budget and an indie team behind it.","December 14, 2014","true","2.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Let's start with the tutorial, where you're told to push the Zangeki button but it doesn't tell you what button that is.  Then, in the main game, you'll find that there are only a few kinds of palette-swapped enemies, and the action is always confined to a perfectly flat, circular arena, and the enemies spawn in *very* long and repetitive waves.  Then you get to the boss fights, each of which has a horrifying spike in difficulty that will require a lot of trial and error deaths to learn their patterns.  Also, you'll realize that the tutorial left out some really important mechanics, such as Just Guard, so you'll die a bunch more until you figure that out.\n\nThe actual hack-and-slash action isn't bad.  There's a good bit of depth in the mechanics - when to use your sword, when to use your special attacks, when to parry and counter and dodge.  It's very difficult, but it's the fair sort of toughness where you always feel like your death was your fault.  The animation is stylish even if it has some technical flaws.  And you can do the samurai thing where you sheathe your sword and the enemy suddenly falls over bleeding, which is pretty damn cool.\n\nBut at the end of the day, it's not enough.  It might have good hack and slash mechanics, but all it does with those mechanics is make you grind through wave after wave of demons, awful boss fights, and boring environments.  It's just not fun.  I bought it for a dollar in the Humble Bundle, and at that price, I don't think my money's wasted, but it's definitely not worth full price.","December 7, 2015","false","2.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

I was expecting Metal Gear Revengeance mixed with Heavenly Sword. Not even close. Every "level" is a square arena with flat textures and bad graphics. Your character doesn't even travel from room to room. There is no world in this game! Waves of Daft Punk rejects appear; you kill them with your sword; the next wave appears; repeat ad nauseam. That's it. I just described the entire game for you. Oh, but let's not forget the annoying bosses that pop up at the end of a few waves. They're exactly like the normal enemies, only they require the patience of a saint to defeat. The main character (I don't even know what her name is) looks kind of like Gogo Yubari from Kill Bill. Very cool, right? Too bad her sole purpose is to shriek in Japanese and flash her crotch. Great character development. The story can be summed up in two sentences. Your friend has a sword that steals souls. Go fight her. That's a wrap, people! Award-winning writing right there! The combat, which should be the highlight of a hack-and-slash game, is pitifully shallow. There are maybe four combos in your whole arsenal. The enemies barely make sounds when you hit them. The interesting features (i.e. replenishing your health by doing a dramatic sword sheath and being able to "bleed" opponents) cower in the gargantuan shadow of bad controls. (Really? Pressing forward on the joystick makes me perform a slow dash attack? I have to keep the joystick in a completely neutral position before I attack? Wonderful.) I played this game for about 45 minutes (which is remarkably HALF of its entire run-time) and asked for a refund. I know many, pre-teen boys will buy this hoping to see some hot, Japanese babes, but the game wasn't even worth the $2.50 USD I paid for it.  Go find babes somewhere else. Or self-respect. That works, too.   3/10.","January 21","false","0.7"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","11","16","2","0"

I came into this game expecting a crappy version of MGR, but instead I got the beautiful lovechild of MGR, God Hand and DMC. A warning: I'd only recommend this game if you're a fan of at least two of these titles. If you don't know how to cancel or use i-frames, this game is liable to eat you up and ♥♥♥♥ you out, especially on anything above normal. If you can already pull this stuff off in other games, you'll find a fantastic, deep combat system. For example: enemy got you stuck in a combo? Cancel your hitstun into a sweep, then cancel the sweep into a dodge. Lovely.\nThe unique aspect of this game is called "Zanshin". After dealing enough damage to an enemy, you can sheath your sword to gain health and blade meter, which you need to use your sword attacks. In addition, enemies who have taken enough damage to become "bloodied" will take a burst of damage. While it sounds simple, it's an engaging move, and sheathing your sword to make 10 enemies burst into a rain of gore is immensely satisfying.\nIn conclusion, like I said, if you're a fan of stylish beat-em-ups and aren't afraid of a challenge, I would 100% recommend this game. If you're after cheap fanservice and panty shots, probably better to go elsewhere.","March 12, 2014","true","7.2"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

However the stages are small and have no differences other than the background. The enemies are dull and are basically 5 models used over again with different colours. The bosses can be challenging at first but you quickly learn the attack patterns and it becomes easy, the only one I died too in the entire game on my first playthrough on normal was the second phase on the last boss. The combat feels fluent however their is a very limitied amount of combos to use and upgrade, making it feel very repetitive after a while.\n\nAudio\nThe audio in his game is terrible, highly recommend playing music or listening to something else while playing this game... The sound effect of hitting an enemy sounds like hitting an enemy in a 90s Super nintendo game. The voice over is good but nothing special. Their is only one song per stage that just loops over and over again.\n\nStory\nYou are a blade templar sent to hunt down a fellow blade templar who has gone rogue and has been drawing power from a demonic sword. Thats about it.. Their is no real back story between these characters, their is no story progression or anything of the sort until the end. But even the ending was basic and gave no story.\n\nSummary\nFor the most part I love hack and slash games, however this one felt worse than X-Blades.. WIth very limited combo moves and the small amount of upgrades available, this game got repetitive very quickly. Basically kill, kill, kill, kill, fight a boss, next level, rinse and repeat. This game could have been a lot better if the developers put some effort into it. The state of it right now just seems lazy and a way to make a quick buck off school girls and panty shots. The only good thing is you can fly through it in a couple hours.","January 22, 2015","false","2.3"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","19","32","0","0"

Red ones have a special little spinny attack and some of the other colored ones do different things. There's also some big fellas that are just as easy as the regular enemies. The AI is pretty stagnant too. Most of the time, they just circle around you while you combo (and by that, i mean mash the X and Y button on the gamepad) the death out of one or two of them. On occasion, one enemy will get the brilliant idea of trying to gang-up on you, but that is usually easily dodged, unless the camera is being a ♥♥♥♥....which it does a lot. The bosses aren't very hard. They have 2-4 different attacks and thats it. You just run around them in a circle, dodging whatever attacks they have, and then mashing X and Y to damage them and then just rinse & repeat. This game is just bland. Obviously the draw here is the anime-sexy-schoolgirl-pantsu-whatever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but even if you were to buy this game JUST for that, you have to wait a while since alternate costumes cost a solid 100,000SP and you need SP to purchase combos or level up health/katana gauges. Then, you can mash the X and Y button in different ways to earn more SP to level up your combos until you can start saving up for the other outfits. Woo hoo. The only slightly redeeming thing about this game is that you can use the SP you earn to buy new combos...but there aren't even that many anyway, hence the "slightly" before "redeeming," if you could even call it "redeeming" to begin with.\n\nAs for the graphics, they aren't HORRIBLE or anything. I mean i've seen much worse here on Steam, graphically speaking. And usually for gameplay I didn't have hardly any issues with frame-rate drops, however the cutscenes only run at about 30fps. So not "good" graphics, but not the worst.\n\nAnother big flaw is the sound. The music is completely bland and forgettable. The noises the enemies make are so repetetive, i'd rather listen to a metronome while fighting then hear the same grunt of pain whenever you hit them every time. The big ones make a slightly deeper sounding grunt at least....\n\nIn sum; Don't buy this. It's a waste of time and money. If you were gifted this or got this in a bundle, just let it run in the background, get the card drops, and sell them for ~$0.22 on the market.\n\nNow, if you're looking for GOOD 3rd person hack-n-slash combo-y games, then I would like to direct you to the MUCH better DMC and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. They both have everything this game doesn't: a good story, good gameplay mechanics, cutscenes that stay over 30fps, great soundtracks, good SFX, and even better voice acting.","August 12, 2014","false","1.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This flaw does not affect your gameplay in Easy, Normal or Hard. I mean the waves after waves of enemies don't consecutively have a go at you non-stop. You could always adjust your camera direction to have your enemies in view. Well at least you have the time. BUT once you reach Very Hard or Inferno, that's when adjusting camera angle to keep your enemies in view becomes a ♥♥♥♥♥. Besides dashing around continously to avoid getting hit by the non-stop attacks of your enemies, you must adjust Misa's direction just to actually hit enemies. And take note, the time frame you have to adjust is about a split second, which you must at the same time release a combo of attacks before dashing off again.\n\nAs for the posing flaw, well I wouldn't call it a flaw. More like she poses too much after some giant combo attack. The developers probably thought, "Hey why not add in some cool poses whenever she does a combo attack so that she looks cool and all". The posing as usual doesn't affect gameplay much in easy, normal and hard. Unless you suck and mess up the combo attacks timing and leave yourself open to attacks since Misa can't actually move while posing. So how does this affect Very Hard? Well couple in together with the lack of a targeting system, having to manually target waves of enemies in a split second, your bound to not get them all during 1 of your big combo attacks. Which in turns come to you getting attack the next instant while your posing.\n\nSo unless there's some sort of update with at least a targeting/lockon system, I wouldn't recommend getting this game at it's original price. But if it's at a discounted price and you have the spare cash, then yea, why not.","December 7, 2014","false","14.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/renerade/recommended/263620/","renerade","Renerade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/renerade/","170 products in account","I was skeptical about this game at first. Watching the trailer of the main character fighting countless clones of baddies that seem to be spewed out by the generic henchmen generating machine kinda gave me Onechanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad flashbacks (and those aren't pleasant ones). But the combat managed to retain my attention. That clean, precise swordplay... the fast-paced action... those flashy lights and effects... the cool, slick, smooth moves... those tiny mini skirts - I mean, uh... those... totally practical mini skirts that don't impair one's ability to do high kicks so that one's undergarnments are pleasingly revealed - I mean... um... huh. Is it getting hot in here?\n\nAt any rate, after buying the game (for pure critical analysis, of course), I noticed the first major issue: The control scheme. Instead of pressing the "A" button (I used the Xbox 360 controller for this experience) to select options in the menues, you have to press the "START" button. The reason for this is because the "A" button is mapped for jumping. Understandable. The "A" button is normally universally known as the "jump button", but you can't exactly jump in the main menu. Unless, of course, the developers didn't want the VSYNC option to leap out of the screen and into the realm of PHYSICAL REALITY.\n\nBut I digress. Once you are able to get a clear picture of the control layout through intense study and getting a degree in reverse-psychology, the controls are failry well utilized. With a simply complex control scheme that complicates the simplicity of practicality... What I'm trying to say is that the combat is good fun. It's fast, it's direct. And simple combos mixed with dodging and countering makes pulling off some flashy moves fairly easy, resulting in you tearing off your shirt and twisting your nipples in triumph... I mean pounding your nipples in triumph. It's a real rush.\n\nThe overall experience is reminisent of those old arcade games you once played as a kid. Time Crisis certainly comes to mind as it shares an almost identical formula. It had graphics that were pleasing to look at, the gameplay was simple and to the point, and you had a blast trying your hardest to get to the next stage without messing up the flow that you had created for yourself. Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae is exactly all of that. A blast from the past, I say. And for a price of $9.99, I'd say that's a pretty fair (and shockingly cheap) deal for a game like this. Plus, watching your character kicking enemies in the face, with the skirt carefully peeling back from the angle of the kick to reveal those... strong... powerful thighs... um. Oh my.\n\nExcuse me, I need to go dump my head in toilet water.","March 19","true","0.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","6","8","3","0"

Combos are fairly freestyle, but there's a slight delay before you can block or dodge cancel attacks, and dodging and blocking requires a higher degree of precision and timing than many other games of the genre, so it most definitely takes  skill  and finesse to master. Many of the unlockable moves and areial attacks are also quite fun, and skilled players who can master parrying and flourishing will be able to unleash impressive destruction on the games swarms of eneimies.\n\nThere are a few issues however. The game sometimes becomes a bit repetitive when it throws the same set of enemies at you several times before mixing things up, making a few waves feel a bit like filler. Buying new moves can sometimes be a liability, as their inputs are often simply attack + any direction, which can be awkward when running around attacking enemies since you'll  have to carefully come to a halt each time if you don't want to accidentally use an unsafe special. I found it easier just to avoid purchasing certain moves. Some may also find being confined to an arena degrades the feeling of adventure and variety found in similar 3d action games. These issues do hold the game back a bit, but they are easily eclipsed by the numerous enjoyable sword fighting moments.\n\nIf you enjoy the sword fighting engine and don't mind the lack of an adventure feel, than there's a lot to love here. The game offers plenty of unlockable difficulty modes for players willing to explore it (I personally recommend starting on hard and working your way up), with the last ones being very real challenges. I recommend trying out the demo on Playism to see if the combat clicks with you, because if it does it will be fairly easy to ignore the games relatively few flaws and focus on the excellent combat.","June 20, 2014","true","3.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Beat up mooks "Dynasty Warrior"-style (as in clone-soldiers mostly waiting to get cut down) in confined arenas over and over until a boss appears and you advance a level. Rinse and repeat a couple of times and be done with it. Add animu-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to the mix.\n\nMaybe I am missing something here, but Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae got boring fast - despite having a lot of features (perfect guard, counter attacks and "flourishes") I don't feel the core of the hacking and slaying is really fun. Combos are mashed out for the most part and once enemies enter a red-blinking "bleeding" state you can kill 'em with a fancy cutscene by pressing a button. There is a bit of a dynamic going on between balancing damage-output and the Katana-gauge that allows for the more devastating attacks (you hold a button down and release it for some 100 Hits Nanto Seiken shenanigans) to be unleashed - but overall I found the combat to be highly unremarkable. Adding insult to injury there is little variety in enemy or stage designs and each "wave" just takes way too long as you wail on tons of enemies enough to insta-kill them with some "holy technique" scoring the big points. Big points which can be used for upgrades that, as far as I am concerned, make the character only harder to control and didn't add the variety this game seriously needs.\n\nIf you enjoy schoolgirl T&A Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae has you covered, apart from that I would recommend getting all the Devil May Cries, Legend of Korra or Metal Gear Rising and even Ninja Blade first before you drop your cash on this.","December 18, 2014","false","2.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/makaspaka/recommended/263620/","makaspaka","makaspaka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/makaspaka/","981 products in account","It's a fun game. Really fun in my opinion. It's a stylish arena hack and slash game. If you're a fan of stuff like anime, you'll probably think the combat is awesome. You slash up enemies with your sword at hyper-fast speeds and as you sheathe your sword, they all fall down, instantly dead. It's pretty cool.\n\nThe graphics aren't anything mind-blowing, but it looks pretty good and gets the job done. Honestly, it could have been all stick figure people and the game would hold up just as well. The real strength of the game is in mastering the combat. The main character, Misa, and her nemesis, Suzuka, both look well animated. Many reviews/comments seem extremely focused on the fact that you get glimpses of panties, but the combat is so fast paced that I've never really noticed. The enemies all look kinda bland, besides the bosses. They are mostly just robot businessmen (I guess...) with a few different colored suits. I suppose the giant robot enemies look kinda cool, too.\n\nAt first glance, the game's pretty short. On normal difficulty, it takes maybe 30 or 40 minutes to beat. It's designed for repeated playthroughs, though. You'll need to replay it multiple times to unlock all the upgrades. The flow of combat is very different between Normal and Very Hard (I still haven't beaten the last level of Very Hard, atm). I beat normal barely ever using the Flourish technique, but on Very Hard, I'm not sure it would even be possible to play without using it. Flourishes are extremely powerful, but require absolute precision to pull off. At the time of writing this, I've played for around 15 hours, and it's still a 50/50 chance that I'll get the timing right on my Flourishes. On Very Hard, a missed Flourish usually means death.\n\nAnother extender of playtime is going for the longest combos you can get. I've probably spent more than half of my time playing trying to achieve the highest combo I can get. At the time of writing this, my highest combo is 2059 (check out my screenshots, I was really proud of that run).\n\nAs for difficulty, there's probably a difficulty level suited for everyone. I started on Normal and it wasn't too challenging. You can pretty much just spam attacks and block or evade to get through Normal. On Hard, you'll have to start mixing up your strategies. You'll need to use Lai Strikes, Heavenly techniques, counters, and the occasional Flourish. Very Hard is as named. You'll really need to start using the advanced moves like counters and Flourishes. You'll also need to be really quick on your feet with dodging and blocking. I've been on the last level of Very Hard for around 3 hours. I now see that 'Game Over' screen every time I close my eyes, lol. As I understand it, there's one more difficulty level after Very Hard, which I haven't yet unlocked. I'd imagine that it's incredibly unforgiving. I haven't tried Easy, but I'd say skip it, unless you are really struggling with Normal.\n\nThere's not much going on story-wise. You play as a demon-slaying schoolgirl for some reason. Another demon-slaying girl who was pals with your character got possessed by a demon when she got an evil sword from ebay or something. Now you gotta kill her. It would be cool if the story had been fleshed out more, but again, the game's biggest strength is it's gameplay.\n\nOne last thing - I'd recommend playing with a controller. I'm sure there are a few people out there who are great at this with the keyboard, but it really seems best-suited to a controller.","June 8, 2014","true","16.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

The answer is yes, and that is not have a uniform involving a miniskirt. I got this game on sale for $5 during one of my buying sprees.\n\nPros:\nPretty decent graphics.\nThe player character animations are nice.\nSome flashy fighting styles.\nJapanese audio.\n\nCons:\nEnemy animations are worse that players, they move alot faster than their walking animation would allow.\nThe gameplay is basically you standing in a circle arena with waves of enemies thrown at you, all enemies are robots.\nSome cliched attacks, like sheathing the katana to have everyone that's been attacked properly suddenly spray blood everywhere.\nStory is pretty bland, you're some blade templar that combats evil and you're after a demon sword that your friend has managed to find/get possessed by. It doesn't really drive the combat either given the sword is demonic but all the enemies seem robotic, maybe it's supposed to be summoning them but there's no real explaination as to where all these freaking guys are coming from.\nThe attack animations are cool but they seem limited. You have Melee, Sword, Holy attack and you can level those up for more hits or damage and you can unlock counterattacks for blocks and aerials but that's pretty much it.\n\nIt's not the worst game you could definitely get worse for $5 but the gameplay got repeatative incredibly fast for me and without a story to drive it, it felt pretty pointless killing wave after wave of random dudes. Also, if you get the majority of the enemies marked to bleed (blinking red) you can just spam the sheathing thing to cause them to go into the spraying blood animation and basically lock them in place till they die (Pretty cheap tactic but one that's easy to figure out).","August 17, 2014","false","0.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KeetonCat/recommended/263620/","KeetonCat","KeetonCat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KeetonCat/","291 products in account","The game's character is well designed and animated (for the most part), but the game has so many problems that it shouldn't be considered a completed game. The gameplay is repetitive and long, the story is virtually nonexsistant, and the sound design is weak.\n\nThe player character model looks great, and the background looks good as well. The enemies aren't that detailed and most look the same, which is dissapointing considering how good the player model looks. The menus could use some work, but operate properly. The character model animations are good and are probably the most enjoyable part of the game.\n\nThe sound design is okay, although the limited sounds get annoying after a while. While the game isn't very big, it would have been beneficial to have some more varying sounds. Many of the sounds in the game are reused throughout, which would be okay if they weren't so obvious. The music is pretty good, I have no real complaint there.\n\nThe story (as far as I can tell) is kind of plain and incomplete. From what I've played through, the story starts right at the climax which isn't very effective for story telling. The Protagonist breifly explains who she is fighting and why and then immediately starts fighting afterwards. The dialogue is plain and doesn't tell much, which is sad because there is such a small amount of it.\n\nThe gameplay is very repetitive and could use the most work. The game doesn't start with any freeroaming (which isn't mandatory in a game, but change of pace is helpful). You fight in a small, round area which makes the sprinting useless. Enemies all have similar attacks except for the big guys, the bosses are just as plain to fight as the regular enemies. Each level is composed of a few waves, which take a long time to finish (this is the main reason I haven't finished). If the stages were shorter and provided enjoyable gameplay it wouldn't feel like such a chore to play each level. The game gives you two basic attacks and the rest of them are optional and not very effecient. I know the team wasn't very big, but the game feels too incomplete to purchase.","August 21, 2014","false","1.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

When playing the game this question still doesn't get answered what one it is trying to be, and instead feels like an engine demo for something that is to come.  The combat is easy to pick up and enjoyable, but there is not enough content or variety to the game to merit buying it.  The game does need a controller and plays closer to Dynasty Warriors but the combat style and enemies are closer to what you see in DMC.","November 20, 2014","false","3.2"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

I will not crack stupid jokes about waifus and pantyshots, and you, dear reader, will take this review not as my scores states, but by taking into account what I said here.\n\nYou see, this is not really a bad game. Its problem lies in the fact for WHO this game is. This game is, what I call, a "You Tube watching" game. The game is very short. A competent player can beat Normal Mode in around an hour or two at best. The enemies are not especially bright in how they fight and most of them can be beaten with one move -> Iai Slash. Once you get this to lvl 3 you can just hold the shoulder button and whack everything with Y. It defeats everything. Some bosses are cheap, but that is until you learn that every attack be Just Guarded. Pretty much till you get to the last Boss, you can dodge all boss attacks. At the last boss, you just Just Guard everything she does.\n\nTHAT SAID HOWEVER\n\nThis game is pretty good for zoning out. Like, you are watching a You Tube video with a lot of talking and not much going on the screen. Its as if you are playing an MMO, just for people that like Hack and Slash games. The game however is VERY SHORT. Seriously, not much content on. Like an Arcade game. You beat the game and leave it. Beat it again and so on. Like a NES title of the old times.\n\nCan I recommend the game? No, I cannot. I got it personally because I like to fight something while watching long game reviews or when I listen to long talks on YouTube and such. I view a lot of movies that are mainly 30 minutes of someone talking and not showing anything on the screen. And this game, when set to easy, is perfect for this task.\n\nI bought it for 2,50 on a sale. It is not a bad game, just incredibly short and for a niche audience. Requires not much skill nor effort to play. Ideal if this is what you are looking for.\n\nAside from all this -> During the one playthrough I made I encountered no bugs at all. ...well except for two annoyances, but these are not bugs. The camera will sometimes spaz if during a boss fight you dodge towards the enemy and hit their model, as if trying to pass throught them. Also, if you die and go to Upgrade menu - the game does not stop there. The enemy boss, even after beating you, will continue their assault despite the fact your character is dead and cannot be hit.\n\nConsider this buy if you are looking for an easy, short game. Its fun to slash people. The moves look great and you feel powerful. But that is all.","November 27, 2014","false","3.7"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

Competant Bayonetta/DMC clone that unfortunately is not deep enough or long enough to be worth the full asking price. There isn't much game here. Expect to fight lots of the same enemies in the same octogon of playable area. The gameplay is fun, but not very deep and frustrating when it shouldn't be. Your rolling has no ability to push enemies or go around them, because their collision data seems to be a giant square around them. Because of this, getting even almost surrounded means death. Even slower hack-n-slash influenced games like Dark Souls and The Witcher have much better and reliable rolling.\n\nDespite this, there is fun to be had in the gameplay, at the very least during levels. Bosses are another level of frustration.\n\nBosses have extremely frustrating collision and hitboxes, and beating the bosses involves memorizing where the damage zones for their attacks are, because they don't actually correspond to the effects at all. Most noticeable on the stage 2 boss, whose punches seem to project a damage aura anywhere in front of his body. If you play enough, you realize that the vast majority of these attacks can only be avoided when rolling in 1 direction, so the difficulty comes from finding out which direction this is. Try rolling directly into attacks first, as this seems to be the only way to beat the lock on tracking everyone but you has.\n\nWill entertain you for an afternoon.

That's about as much story as I got. I played this game for an hour, beat the first boss and there was zero plot/story development.\n\nInitially, combat is alot of fun. You can jump, block, dodge, beat enemies with your fists or katana and unleah powerful holy attacks. Every time you use your Katana, it drains your katana bar, using mele attacks on enemies refills your katana bar. In order to unleash special attacks, you have to sucessfully hit your enemies with your basic attacks in order to unleash special holy attacks. If you take a hit, it puts your combo gague back to zero. Killing your enemies earns you SP which you can then spend on upgrades.\n\nHowever, after about 10 minutes the combat becomes bland and uninspired. You fight waves and waves of enemies that are essentially identical, with identical attacks. New enemies are just reskins. Combat takes place in a closed-off, ring-like area, where you fight waves of trash and eventually a boss appears. After beating a boss, move on to the next circular arena where you fight more waves of reskinned enemies with the same music and background.

Seriously, a sword? how about a physical demon or devil? That's like saying that my shoes are possessed by the devil and those who wear them will become evil.\n\nAlso, the characters aren't all too important either. Even though their are plenty of panty shots of one of these girls, it doesn't make the game any better. It's just there to encourage you to beat the game and that doesn't work on me.\n\nThe enemies, seem to be all the same except color change and more health with little to no variation\n\nThe camera never focuses on your enemies, except for the boss. Oh jeez, remember Sonic '06 with the horrible camera? well, that's exactly where this game is taking it's camera lessons from.\n\nThe bosses take a while to kill and that's respectible but you would think the first boss would be a piece of cake, right? No, it's not. Non of them are, so if you want to beat the game, then train hard and kill anything in sight without taking too much damage or dying too much.\n\nIn conclusion, i just can't recommend this game by how bad it is. Forget about the stupid and irrelevant Boobs and\nPantsu images. It doesn't matter in this game and it shouldn't matter at all. For those who want to play a REAL Hack n' slash game that's exciting, don't get this game at full price, as it'll make you wonder why you wasted nearly $10 on a game that doesn't look or play all too special.\n\n","December 27, 2014","false","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Good character art. You will especially notice it during the cutscenes, just how good the character art is. There may or may not exist better today, but it's still beautiful in my eyes.\n\n2. Good graphics. Pretty much the same as above, except this one is meant for the environment, enemies etc. The background graphics is ALMOST as good as the character art. The enemies are well made too, albeit kind of out of place for a story like this one, or maybe that's just me.\n\n3. Cool moves and attacks. Some of them are really worth upgrading to full lvl not only in terms of dmg, but also to make them even cooler.\n\n4. Bosses are insanely hard even on normal difficulty and that's where the game really shines in my opinion.\n\n5. The camera is great during boss fights.\n\n6. Pantsu.\n\n\nCons:\n\n1. The game is fought in "waves" with the 5th one (or was it 6th?) being a boss. That in itself is good and all, but what I dislike are the waves themselves. The enemies in the waves seem mostly brain dead (except for one or two who actually take skill to defeat). In short, you can pretty much just spam attacks on them and you will be fine.\n\n2. The maps / levels are fought on a platform and thus offers very little space. I'd rather it have a bigger map and where you have to MOVE from point A to point B just to give a simple answer to an alternative.\n\n3. The camera during "waves" is just...Awful beyond words. It's so awful that you... Just kill the waves quickly 'kay?\n\n4. Like I kind of said at no. 1, the game feels repetitive during waves and unless you want to practice or want to try out a new skill you bought, you really just want to eliminate the waves quickly.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\nIt's a great fighting game, albeit a very short one (I completed it in about 4h but I didn't buy all the upgrades either) but it is worth the money.

This Japanese indie hack&slash game is pretty challenging if you're going for 100% - otherwise it's very short and dull (like, if you only go for 1 playthrough on easy). There is nothing to explore either, the levels are simply stages where it's you against waves of enemies until a boss shows up, so it really comes down to whether you like hack&slash gameplay or not. Another perk is that the protagonist is a Japanese girl in a school uniform wielding a katana, if you're into that.","August 21, 2014","true","17.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But after getting a few upgrades, you'll start getting those cool "iai feelings", something that will remind you of samurai movies and anime.

The real challange begins when you start playing on Very Hard, the enemies won't stand still like idiots anymore and will be more aggresive.

But the truth of it is that this game is a fraction in quality and quantity of some of the anime games that you can find on PS3/Wii. The PC game industry must realize that a port of said games (or even better an original game for PC) will immediately enter a market of high demand, as this game shows. Mitsurugi may be a cute anime katana fighter but she is nothing compared to playing characters like Boa Hancock in One Piece Pirate Warriors, or the characters available in Naruto Ninja Storm.

This doesn't mean that the game is worth any less when compared to them, especially considering this is an independent game whose staff consists of three developers, a musician and two voice actresses for its original Japanese release.\n\nYou attack by using hand to hand combat for charging the sword gauge, using the sword and a quick draw blade attack. Once enough damage has been dealt to the enemies, they will begin glowing red, which means they're wounded. Unlike other games of this genre, MHK has a move in which the protagonist, Misa, sheathes her sword and all wounded enemies sustain damage as she draws orbs for upgrade points (currency) and for healing herself. Moves like guarding are also available, with the possibility to counter with the sword and a special parry called "Flourish," which deals a large amount of damage.\n\nUpgrade points are, as their name implies, used to strengthen Misa's parameters like health and the sword gauge. Her moves can also be upgraded for dealing more damage, better range and mobility.\n\nThe playability of the game compares to the bigger franchises, which is always good. Replayability is key when trying to unlock and upgrade all of Misa's skills and new to the Steam version, unlocking two of her costumes.\n\nWhile the game is optimally played with a controller, keyboard controls are also available (no mouse support, though). Everything can be mapped to the user's liking.\n\nFor the asking price and the amount of hours of fun it represents, this indie game quite a bargain.","March 11, 2014","true","16.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

The story is just here to say it exists, the ending is a letdown but i did not care honestly.\n\nAs a big plus, for once this kind of game doesnt use fan service to sell, exept a panty shot here and there during some evasive actions, nothing is oversexualized, and thats a good thing, same for the unlockables costumes.","November 2, 2014","true","1.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

But I can let that pass for the price.\n\nThat aside, the combat is fun, simple but still has a little depth. I recommend you play on hard mode though, because that's where the it shines and tests your abilities. You can unlock new abilities and it's hella fun to combine them to slay down your enemies. What I really liked is the Zanshin move, which refills your Health and Katana Gauge by a bit, plus it damages all enemies that have entered bleeding state, adding another layer of strategy to the combat.\nAlthough some of the bosses have a predictable pattern.\n\nThere are a few things to unlock, mainly costumes.\n\nAll in all, it's fun and you can't complain for the price.

This is one fast paced game, you DONT put it down, you DONT stop playing, you keep going until your fingers bleed to the bones.   Meet the main character Misa a Knights Templar sworn to defeat evil, by channeling the ancient chinese arts of kung fu power from her ancestors, she becomes a Holy Ninja, blessed by god with her Samurai sword in her Japanese school uniform. Misa Must defeat the evil demon Suzuka, who in reality is her BFF AND save the world,  its only her Junior year in High school!!!!!!\n\nIn Japan everyone is guaranteed the right to bear swords, and with great power comes great responsibility as the AMAZING Suzuka finds out!!!   Suzuka even says "I'll give you my sword when you pry it from my cold dead hands!"   During the final battle all of Suzuka's clothes come off exposing her true evil, you must defeat the evil to get Suzuka back her clothes so she can contain her true inner demon.\n\nThis game has ALOT of replay value, its easy to play, the tutorial is awesome and super fast, nothing is that hard that you cant pick it up in 15 minutes.  In the last forever, there has never been a good wave attack arena game I can think of, this one so far is the best!  Even better its only 260mb.\n\n*Tips:  To defeat the 2nd boss the one who looks like he has car tires for hands dash in circles around him, and dodge those charge attacks then hit him 3 times and run away.  Rinse and repeat.  When Suzuka loses her clothes its best to avoid ALL her attacks and only attack her 3 times after her 5 hit combo.  Rinse and repeat until you can get her clothes back to contain her inner demon.\n\nRating:  10/10  Value:  $14.99","June 8, 2014","true","4.0"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

No. I'm not joking. Slap a girl in it, give her different attack animations and change the enemies and you get yourself Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae.\n\nHave I discouraged you yet? Well... don't be.\n\nTo start off this review, the menu is... a little different. You get to look at the protagonist named Misa on your right and... she looks hot, alright. Furthermore, the main menu is also where you get to change her costume, though you unlock those costumes later on in the game. Oh, and on an unrelated note, you can view the changes in graphics by looking at Misa as you change the settings, which is pretty neat.\n\nThe controls are pretty nimble. They're very responsive, but you are unable to customize your controls to your liking. You can only choose to play this game with default controls or play it like how you would in Devil May Cry (no surprise there, since the game bears so many resemblance to Devil May Cry that IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A MODDED GAME OF DEVIL MAY CRY FOR <censored>'S SAKE).\n\nThe gameplay feels repetitive as you are showered with enemies for you to kick, punch and slash your wave through multiple waves before meeting a boss in each chapter, though as you progress to later chapters, you will fight deadlier enemies. Using your katana drains the katana gauge, and if depleted, you won't be able to use the katana unless you fill it up again by dealing melee attacks or killing an enemy. Health pickups can only be dropped once you kill a boss and your overall health stays the same amount with no chance of regeneration, even before starting a new chapter after completing the previous chapter (I seem to like this feature a lot, though it does make my teeth grit in frustration as I progress to a new chapter with only a considerable amount of health left). And as you progress to the game, the game awards you with SPs which you can use to unlock costumes or upgrade your character, as well as learning new skills.\n\nMy verdict tells me that this game is a slight breath of fresh air if you're looking to play Devil May Cry as a female (assuming you got bored of playing as Dante) and if you're pessimistic enough or if you're a DMC fanboy/fangirl,  you will be disappointed with the game as it doesn't feel like the game is any different than Devil May Cry itself. However, if you can put all the blatant similarities aside, this game is genuinely fun and if you're a fan of hack-and-slash games (or Japanese girls, if you have that fetish), get it now while the game still offers a sale.\n\nRather, just get it anyway. It's bloody cheap. You don't really need to wait for a sale unless you're in a tight budget.","March 12, 2014","true","2.1"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reikaou/recommended/263620/","reikaou","Reika","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reikaou/","68 products in account","Let me just start off by saying that especially if you get it on sale, this game is really worth playing. It's pretty cheap even at full price anyway. For me it's like spending a day at the arcade or something.\n\n\nPros:\n- Graphics are nice (better than most screenshots you'll see online if you crank it up in settings, and it can probably take third-party enhancements but I haven't tried yet)\n- Lightweight program (it's like 249 MB on disk, doesn't consume a lot of RAM either)\n- Quick action (all stages are like arenas, enemies just come to you in waves)\n- Surprisingly challenging (I'll go into detail later)\n- Beautiful character designs\n- After a few skill upgrades you can be chaining combos like crazy, and that's just plain fun (if the game had only this to offer and had uglier graphics for example, it still would've been worth the sale price for me)\n- Combat against bosses requires intelligence and quick thinking. You can't just hold your block key and think you can safely tank their attacks. I'll go into more detail below.\n\n\n\nCon:\n- Not a lot to do (it's really just enemies coming to you in waves in a few arenas then a boss to end that stage)\n- Controls take getting used to, and are marked by symbols in-game instead of their corresponding keyboard/controller mapping\n- Camera control and angling isn't very good except in the boss view mode, which you can use against regular enemies, but it requires constantly pressing a button (can't toggle). Because of this, you could get hit by grunts from behind (though it's arguable that this adds to the challenge and can be a good thing for some; nobody can see behind them IRL anyway)\n- UI isn't polished, and there are translation inaccuracies\n- Lots of buttons to press; you really need to customize it to something that's comfortable for you or learn the default well\n- You can't remap existing moves (some are inconveniently placed, for example movement key + basic attack will cause you to do a flip kick, which isn't good if you accidentally do it when you wanted to do a basic attack)\n- The challenge might cause a lot of frustration and ragequitting\n\n\nI have more cons than pros but I still recommend it. I'm playing Hard mode now and the good mix of combo chaining and challenge due to high punishment for mistakes is keeping me in the game so far.\n\nOn the challenge of this game, I thought at first it'd be a simple fighting game like the Musou games from KOEI (Dynasty Warriors, etc.). Just make sure you hit first and complete your combos and you're good in Musou. No such simplicity in Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae. Even against the grunts you need to watch their movements and time your blocks and dodges. Bosses have a variety of moves, the damage of most of which can only be avoided using certain means (some moves are unblockable and need to be dodged, some moves can't be dodged and need to be blocked). You have the learn their moves and how to counter them, including what kinds of attacks work best for certain situations. You certainly can't spam combos, button mash, or sorta turn your brain off during fights. This will keep you on your toes.\n\nWhat's funny is that with boss fights whenever you get killed, you'll probably be thinking like "man I saw that move, I could've dodged that hit!" Then you retry. For me it's just the right amount of frustrating challenge that keeps me coming back.\n\nWill the game get old eventually? Yes I think so especially once you master the movements of enemies. But for now it's a wonderful distraction, and by the time I get tired of it, I feel like I'd already gotten my money's worth.","December 25, 2014","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Graceland/recommended/263620/","Graceland","Graceland™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Graceland/","315 products in account","Currently got 18~ hours and counting - Trying to unlock everything.\n\nFirst things first - It's an Arena Hack n Slash. Don't expect fancy castles to run through, or a big universe to discover. It is an Arena Hack n Slash after all.\nSecond - Use a controller. I havn't tried with a keyboard, and don't intend to, but a controller works perfectly. The controls are pretty easy to figure out, and the reactions are smooth. If there's problems you can always rebind the controls to fit, and you can also check the tutorial and the upgrade shop for what abilities are binded to what.\n\nYou're playing as a Japanese school girl who is trying to stop her classmate from turning evil due to a possessed sword. The story is not exactly huge - it's basicly just that; You're trying to stop your classmate from turning evil. So the story is not the huge selling point.\n\nThere's a couple of different enemies, and as you go through the levels, newer and stronger appears.\nYou can initially choose 3 difficulties - the AI gets stronger and more aggressive as the difficulty goes up. Once you've completed the initial 3 difficulties (or rather, you just need to win on hard) you unlock Very Hard, which you need to beat to unlock Inferno (from what I've heard atleast - I'm only on Very Hard so far). This means that you'll have to figure your way through the various difficulties by understanding each enemy's mechanics and how to counter them.\n\nThere's an upgrade shop in which you can spend points, earned throughout the game by killing enemies, to learn new skills or/and upgrade your current ones to do more damage, have a longer range, consume less energy (Katana Gauge in this game, which is acquired by either using attacks that doesn't require the sword, or by using "Zenshin" which is the withdrawal of the sword to finish bleeding enemies).\n\nThe game also has the mechanic of "bleeding" - in which the enemies becomes more vulnerable, and can take extra damage from "Zenshin", which is a type of finisher, that, actually, also serves as a healing ability if enough attacks are executed.\n\nThere's also the ability to Guard, Perfect Guard (+ counter) and Flourish.\nGuard is, well, where you hold the parry button. You can guard most attacks, but regular guard can also be broken if enough hits are taken in a row.\nPerfect Guard is when you parry on the timing of when an attack will hit you - You can Perfect Guard anything (though sometimes you'll be hit by several things in a row, which means you might not be able to perfect guard the next attack in time). You can, if upgraded / bought, use a counter after perfect guarding to deal back some damage.\nFlourish.... The strongest ability in the game, but incredibly hard to learn aswell. It's like perfect guard, however, you have to be even better in the timing. The difference between Flourish and Perfect Guard is (except you have to "buy" Flourish) is that Flourish is an attack - not a parry. Flourish essentially uses the attack of the enemy, where right before said attack actually hits you, to counter attack with an incredibly power attack. This skill is most probably essential to get down and learn if it's of the interest to beat Very Hard / Inferno.\n\nThe game is fairly short per difficulty, but the next difficulties takes more and more time because you have to go through more and more enemies.\n\nTo make it short:\n\nPros:\n- A smooth Arena Hack n Slash (comboing is pretty easy)\n- Easy to learn, difficult to master (I suck at using Flourish)\n- Nice artstyle, which is also appealing.\n- Unlockables\n- Entertaining if interested in Japanese, and hack and slash.\n- Controller recommended (I find this to be a Pro, as I prefer when these types of games needs to be used with a controller - Keyboard / Mouse just doesn't fit hack and slash).\n- Japanese school girl (Pantsu!)\n- Various mechanics (especially Bleed, Perfect Guard, Flourish)\n\nCons:\n- Repetitive (Most people don't like repetitive game, though I enjoy this game atleast)\n- Short / Underdeveloped story (this games selling point is the actual gameplay for an Arena Hack n Slash, not the story).\n\nI recommend it, with a score of probably 8/10 in the Hack n Slash genre.\n\n\n\nA little side note (a rant if you may) - For those who review games, while having played less than atleast 5~ hours of the game... Don't bother reviewing - The "recommend" reviews that says nothing but "Pantsu" isn't an actual review, nor is the rant about how the game is supposedly bad while having 0.2hrs of gameplay (Seriously - Atleast try to play the game for a bit before complaining... It might be that you just suck at the game, not that the mechanics are awful).","June 24, 2014","true","23.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You fight onsalught of enemies wave after wave with the occasional boss fight thrown in for good measure. there is the .01% story about a sword corruption a friend or something but you will mostly ignore the story anyway and it knows it so the scenes are quite short. There is no platforming and the stages ( I use this term lightly) are all the same small circular arena with a different backdrop.\n\nWhere the game shines is its satisfying combat system with upgradable moves and skills that you use coins earned from combat to buy. Very quickly this game ramps up in difficulty and understanding the mechanics and purchasing upgrades based around your style of play becomes very important.\n\nYouy will need a gamepad to really enjoy this game, however this is not much of a problem. This is the first game I have bought in years to allow you to remaps gamepad controls or select from default options, so you don't have to screw around with a 360 controller or workaround keymappers to play it, this is a godsend.\n\nThe artstyle/graphics are not of very high calibur and there is very little in terms of variety when it comes to enemies and stages however you won't notice it after about 5 minutes due to how much fun you are having.\n\n\nIf this sounds like a game you would enjoy give it a pickup, but for those looking for a dramatic story straight from their favorite anime give it a pass.","June 20, 2014","true","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

On that note, the game does seem to spike wildly between insultingly easy and frustratingly difficult.\n\nThere is a story, but it's the typical cliched anime nonsense, nothing special, but that's typical if games in this area.  The graphics, while not mind blowing, are very well done overall, though the environments are completely barren outside of the backdrop of each stage.  The music is fairly standard as well, but it fits the action well enough.\n\nAnd of course there's the fanservice.  Oh, the fanservice.  Should that really make me like it more?

It wasn't the game's fault or anything. It was because I sucked and couldn't get passed Kaiser, the second boss... lol. So I dropped the game and rage quit. But after giving it some time, I decided to come back to the game, with a clear understanding as to how to play the game. After many frustrations of losing to the second boss over and over, I finally over came Kaiser! :D I wasn't being patient enough and I made a common mistake which was mindlessly hacking and slashing. This is definitely a game where you need to take your time with the bosses and understand their attack pattern.\n\nThe story is very bare, there's just enough for you to know the goal of our blade maiden. Friend gets an evil sword, said evil sword possesses friend, heroine must stop said evil sword even if it means killing friend. Pretty simple, but it's there.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game would probably be the wonky camera controls, it moves a little too fast for me to follow my enemies. The game is also very short. I hope there is going to be a sequel to the game.\n\nI suck at reviewing video games so I'll cut to the chase. Would I recommend this?

Gameplay is straight forward, the story is very short, level design is repetitive, and has limited enemy variety. You can't go around exploring areas, but instead you are tossed in to a small area and kill waves of what appears to be Daft Punk having access to cloning vats. The selling point of this game is the cute gir— Uh, I mean, the selling point is the panti— *ahem* One of the best part of the game is the combat. It's varied and deep akin to other hack and slash games like Devil May Cry and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. On my first playthrough, blocking was tricky for me and it's not as forgiving as the parry mechanic in MGR. But yeah, it was my first playthrough and the game is replayable (*ahem*getting*ahem*that*ahem*school*ahem*uniform*ahem*unlock*ahem*).\n\nFor a game that cost me next to nothing, Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae is one attractive and fun hack and slash.

In spite of this it is still good fun because the combat feels pretty visceral with some interesting mechanics like the Holy technique attacks, which can charged up and then cancelled into blade attacks. The graphics are also pretty good considering that it must have been made with a tiny budget.\n\nI think a lot of the negative reviews were from people expecting something more on par with Platinum's character action games, despite the fact that this game is simply a doujin game. As long as you buy the game being aware of what you're getting into and acknowledge that it won't be as good as say, Bayonetta, it is good fun.","February 14","true","1.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It offers a simple control scheme, but once you invest some points into the skills in the upgrade menu, you'll find that the game has some in-depth mechanics that are well implemented. Like all hack n slash games, you control one character, in this case Misa, against hordes of enemies in a small arena with no obstacles and no obstructions in the way. That's quite perfect for this kind of game, as you wanna make sure you have full awareness of all enemies around you and combo them to your heart's content. Like every game in existence, there are pros and cons to this game:\n\nPros:\n- Great control scheme that feels good, nothing convoluted\n- A ''Zandatsu" feature well implemented that can tip the battle to your favor\n- Plenty of action to be held in this game!\n- Uh, hot chicks with swords\n- Nice visuals and fluid swordsplay\n- Good variety of skills that flow well into one another\n\nCons;\n- very limited enemy archetypes, offers very little imagination\n- Very short game, but then again it's to be expected when it's only about 300mbs\n- The timing on the ''Flourish'' and '' Counter'' moves feel very awkward\n- No camera lock-on feature?\n- Roll hurtbox is funky\n- Next to no unlockable content to unlock, other than costumes I believe\n\nPersonal input:\nSince I play just about every hack n slash I can think of, this game is a defnite buy for any fan of the genre. It's hack n slash to its purest, with quite possibly the shortest story i've seen in a long time. It does have its faults, with no lock-on feature which to me is quite crucial in a hack n slash, but it doesn't hinder the pure adrenaline rush this game provides. As it stands with its current price, I'd say wait till a 50% sale comes up for it, but if you do buy it as is, then know you're getting your money's worth in the action, not so much for the story nor content.","March 12, 2014","true","9.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Just combat. Now if you don't mind being trapped in a circle, it's pretty fun!\n\nI like the fluidity, the movement, and the general ease of stringing moves together and dodging/blocking through things! Graphics and sound are nice, Misa is really elegant and cool as well!\n\nI hope it gets a sequel, and I hope the sequel has some more proper exploration through Japan, though. I wanna explore buildings and fight through the streets and such!\n\nSo while it's probably a bit repetitive, if you're a big fan of fast-paced action games and you really like the -action- part, fighting constantly through hordes, this game should be pretty fun for you.\n\nWhile I certainly wish you weren't so confined, it is a small doujin game and if this game does well hopefully we'll get more, with some better you can actually run around and explore! I don't personally mind, given the price and size of the game but I know there are those of you who would/are turned off by this. Have fun, guys!\n\nBasically, if you have no attention span, read this NOW:  It's a fairly short game. No exploration. You fight in circles. Not many enemys to fight, either.\n\nBut if you get it cheap, and you really like DMC and Ninja Gaiden style action games, I think you're in for some fun! Personally, I like those kinds of games a ton. If you also like them a ton, I highly recommend this game.","August 8, 2014","true","4.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","3"

I come back about two months later and still see "pantsu". You must be asking "They made a game about panties then?" and if gameplay footage of this game is an indicative about anything, it's that this is not a game about panties.\n\nWhat is it, then? I hear you asking. It's an arcade-style action game that not coincidentally features a female protaganist. Who wears a short skirt. Don't my words as being conservative or anything. I am merely trying to help you understand how this "pantsu" thing started. So panties are not what you will exclusively get to see in this game. Most of the time, you will be saying "HOLY ****!" or "There are so many enemies!" or shouting at your mother why you are vociferating. She will come over and say "It's just a game." and you will want to beat the daylights out of her. But I digress.\n\nWhat we have here is a fast-paced action game with a female protagonist with a story that could not care more about itself even if it tried. So this is a story about a girl, a blade-templar, named Misa tracking down and killing her classmate, Suzuka, who is possessed by a demon sword and popping up monsters all over. At first glance, you would think "That sounds like every other fantasy story." And you would be right. The writing for this game is simply uninteresting. How did Suzuka come in possession of a demon sword? Who are the blade templars? Is there no way to save Suzuka? All these questions flutter about inside your head and there is no answer for them. At least, in the game.\n\nBut the story is not the charm of this game. People who love it, including yours truly, love it for the high-pace and high-action. It feels like a Devil May Cry game. Or something out of a Devil May Cry game. Though DMC has so much more substance in comparison and has a story and lore to go with it. The combat is challenging. The crowds are not overly aggressive as long as you can put some distance between you and your targets.\n\nMy first disagreement with this game, though. is how you have to rely on upgrades to get you through the game. I mean, you can survive until the last boss without any upgrades to health but eventually you will have to take them. Boss fights are a little bland for my tastes. You can't take them head on. They have too much range or are too spammy for you to take advantage of anything.  That is if you wish to get unclose and personal. That is it, really. I would have liked it if you didn't have only one viable method of fighting a boss. It's always space, holy tec full charge, space, holy tec full charge, bleed, zanshin. It ends up being repetitive than fun.\n\nNow for the big question: Is it worth buying? Well, if you are well-versed in action games and like the adrenaline pumping into your vein or simply looking relieve some stress. then you will like this game. But if you don't like repetitive tasks, don't like action games, there is a good chance you won't like this game. If you are looking for your entry into the genre, I suggest you seek something easier.","August 23, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The main characters may look nice and I'd expect them to have been the main selling point, but the gameplay itself is lacking.\n\nThe stages are all set on circular arenas with only the arena texture, the models surrounding the arena and the enemy waves varying. There aren't many different enemy times outside palette switched ones - cyborg(?) men in suits, large cyborgs, some cyborgs wielding a huge blade and some armored knight-lookalike. Sure, at least the two first have palette switches that denote different attacks, but the enemies are sorely lacking in variety. The phases before the level end boss are in general pushovers and I've managed to clear them (on normal difficulty) pretty well just mashing two buttons (sword slash and sword sheathing).\n\nKilled enemies earn the player skill points which can be used to purchase new skills and upgrade old ones - not that there are all that many of them. I'd think Streets of Rage had more different moves than Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae has.\n\nWhereas the fodders are way too easy, the bosses are in comparison very hard. Prepare to die by their hand several times - until you figure out that maxing out the sword sheathing and the special counter skill allows you to beat the enemies just by retrying the battle until you've managed to time your counters to enemy attacks the necessary 3-5 times to kill off the opponent. I still have trouble beating even the first two bosses, yet I've managed to complete the game (on normal difficulty).\n\nOn hard difficulty, the fodders become challenging as well and even the first level can cause trouble.\n\n(EDITED: Added the note about hard difficulty and the fourth common enemy type.)","March 16, 2014","false","8.6"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","16","32","0","0"

Already had it from Playism, but I bought it again here during the Steam Sale to support the devs and publisher. For 2 1/2 bucks, this is probably the best arcade experience you're going to find on modern PC.\n\nIt's just stylish battles in arenas, and there isn't a ton of enemy variety. The visuals are a little basic, but the character models - especially main character, Misa - look fantastic, as do the bigger enemies (not so much the guys in suits who look like Daft Punk imo).\n\nThat stylish arena battling, the real meat of the game? It has plenty of depth to provide for really  intense combat that ramps up pretty quickly. And it's just addicting failing > purchasing upgrades > trying again, just because you keep doing better and better. It's definitely one of those games where all the upgrades are hefty. You feel their impact immediately after hopping back into the game. The way upgrades should be.\n\nI highly recommend this title. At $15, $10 or (like it is now) $2.49.

It felt unfair, unpolished and clumsy, and yet I found myself continuing to play, just to beat that damn second boss.

Now the reason that i would recommend this to anyone is the fact that its on sale currently and anyone who likes grindly japanese hack and slash games might enjoy this. The only game i can think of to compare it to that makes sense is Onechanbara as the combat is the same as well as how you unlock all of your abilites but thats about it. Everything in this game achievement wise can be completed in probably 6-8 hours if youre fast probably 10 if you take it slow and the replay value is very low after everything is done.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xiaomu/recommended/263620/","Xiaomu","Xiaomu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xiaomu/","161 products in account","I didn't really go in expecting much from this game, though it was hard to tell exactly what I was in for because most of the gameplay videos out there are made by people that are more curious about the content rather than actually being good at action games like this. That said, it's actually kind of fun in its own way and does blend things from games like DMC3/4 and MGR while still creating its own unique dynamic.\n\nThe main gameplay consists of using your hand-to-hand moves which replenish your blade meter and then using your blade moves which grant long reach without losing any of the speed you'd get from hand-to-hand moves at the expense of using up the aformentioned blade meter. Like MGR the game kind of revolves around dodging and parrying (although it works more like DMC's Royal Guard style) and hacking away at enemies until they are "bleeding" (like MGR's Zandatsu-able enemies where you have to whack them until they turn blue and can be cut). When an enemy goes into a bleeding state, your blade moves cause significantly more damage but it also, more importantly, opens up enemies to your finisher move (called Zanshin) which puts you in a vulnerable state while you sheath your sword away, all flashy-like, as if you were Vergil's own daughter. This move lets you regain health, regain all your blade mode meter and does a whole bunch of damage based off your current "style" ranking (which increases whenever you hit people, block moves, do your special blade moves but decreases severely whenever you get hit. Style affects your general damage and can also instant kill bleeding enemies when using Zanshin I believe), however you are extremely vulnerable and it only affects enemies that are in a bleeding state; all other enemies can attack you freely. It's like if MGR's Zandatsu didn't have any invulnerability.\n\nThis leads to you wanting to balance between hacking away with both fists and swords, using your special AoE moves that do massive damage but take massive amounts of blade meter and using Zanshin when its safe and with as many bleeding enemies as possible to up your rank and get more points. I've only just beaten it on normal mode, which was still pretty challenging as it took me a while for the whole meta of the game to click but there is replayability in harder difficulties plus moves and costumes to unlock from that you'd have to do in more than one playthrough. No clue on if enemy AI is remixed in hard mode but the enemy waves are along with the enemies being tougher in general in terms of having more HP and doing a little bit more damage.\n\nThis game is a game first and foremost, and though it lacks the combat depth or general refinement that DMC, Bayonetta or even MGR have, it still manages to be fun for what it is as long as you're not expecting anything more than an arena Hack n' Slash with a flashy moveset and laughably clichéd story. For the $8.50 that I bought it at, I'd say its worth it but ONLY if you're an enthusiast of games of this genre (or a hardcore weaboo).","March 14, 2014","true","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Or something.\n\nWhat may appear to be a shallow and lazy hack and slash type action game really isn't as bad as it might seem. At its core it shows a lot of premise, with fighting mechanics requiring precise timing to perform counters, dodging, blocking and looking for openings to counter attack. When your in the rhythm, it is rather enjoyable.\n\nThere are two main types of attack, fists and blade. Using your fists builds up your blade meter, whereas using your blade attacks slowly drains it, however you deal more damage that way. As you continue to do damage, you'll build up charge in your blade, when unleashed it will do further damage to bleeding enemies and recharge your health meter. Finally there is a "holy"attack, hold down the third attack button and it will slowly charge, tap the modifier button however and it'll surge blade power into it, making it come charge instantly for each time pressed. In the heat of battle, this will help with crowd control.\n\nThe biggest downside to the combat is how repetitive it is to smash the same two attack buttons over and over again, doing 20+ hit combos on a base level bad guy. This element of grinding in an action game is not exactly the most exciting way to progress.\n\nThe other major problem is the game feels incredibly incomplete. Animations don't transition well between different movements, they just happen immediately and it looks a little jarring. Secondly the level design is non existant, you are in one arena running around killing the same types of enemies over and over.\n\nThe ultimate downside is there is a solid foundation to expand this into a solid side scrolling beat-em-up, but no real budget allowance to make it happen. As an action game that feels like a sloppy Ninja Gaiden, I don't think it would fare too well. Make it a beat-em-up not unlike Final Fight however, it could do quite well.\n\nVisually it's pretty basic, but crisp. A lot of time went into the main characer's model which is always good for an action game, but everything else is pretty lacking. Sorely lacking really.\n\nIn the end it's a cheap wave after wave action game that is insipidly bare bones, with some potential to become something rather good. It just needs a story, level design, more enemies, more music, finished animation sequeneces....well and entire game to be honest.\n\nIt's fun though.\n\n5\n\nA mediocre average game that is hugely incomplete, with some halfway decent action and a main story mode that feels like a tacked on mini game.","June 22, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are like 2 different stages that are set to 3 different daytimes. You face 5 enemy waves and then fight a boss. The graphics are solid but nothing special. The gameplay is kinda addictive and quiet fluent. Your char can wear like 5 different costumes. You get a feeling for speed and power combined with a sexy schoolgirl fighting her former classmate to purify her soul from demon spirits. After each stage you can use earned points to level up your skills or buy different clothes. I recommend you purchase this game when its on sale, not sure if 10 Euros are a reasonable bargain for you since you might get games with longer gamplay for that price. From the screenshots or Youtube videos the game looks way worse then it in fact is. The gameplay is very fun and has great potential. It reminds a little bit of Onimusha Warlords except you stick with the same sword and dont use elemental magic attacks. You can block attacks and use 2 different holy skills, nice kicks and beat the crap out of your enemies.

(Looks back at its price point..)\n- This isn't an adventure game, and will isolate players on a very small plain each stage.\n- Gameplay gets repetitive quickly , yes this game has Beat em' up syndrome too.\n- Some unlockable skills will probably be tossed in the player's trash bin of unused skills.\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, espeically those who find displeasure in a game with very strict mechanics. The use of Just Guard, Parry, and Counters in the game leaves players with a tiny window to use. Some hardcore action gamers would adapt to such, but it is difficult for people to make use of in general. Enemies attacks have priority over the player's, meaning if an enemy is attacking you aren't... unless you're some hotshot who is very good at judging the frames on attacks. While I personally see a lot of potential in its combat, it does not hold up as a novel or an exploration simulator it does make a fun, rewarding hack and slash game in my humble opinion. 7/10","June 25, 2014","true","17.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And, well, sword-wielding females making up the main cast. MKH merely lacks them wearing all but a bikini and a ten gallon.\n\nFor a doujin title, its rather respectable. Again: for a doujin title. The interface has a bit of tack to it and, as I said, the battle system doesnt feel as tight as it could have been. You are tasked with fighting things before fighting things and then fighting maybe other things before getting a boss fight. Who you fight. My main gripe with said fighting was how easy it is to trigger annoying, weak, inappropriate and, most importantly, slow to recover attacks without meaning to do so. I feel like that could have been easily avoided by having them only activate with another independent button -- a lock-on, for example.\n\nThe difficulty isnt to be sniffed at either, bosses in particular will be quick to whittle away if you dont wise up quick enough and its surprisingly easy to get stunlocked by mere mobs (another negative trait shared with the Onechanbara series). With no means to cheese enemies via a ranged attack or super mode featuring health regen the latter battles on higher difficulties can become a test of mettle more than anything.\n\nIts a good little slasher and a fine example of what can come out of Comiket, just dont go in expecting a perfectly polished experience.","March 12, 2014","true","5.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Suzuka a close friend of yours has gotten her hands on the Demon Blade and is being corrupted by the powers it holds. The swrod manafests enemies and bosses through Suzuka's life force. So what do you do in turn? Fight your way through countless enemies and bosses in between stages.\n\nThere are 5 stages and 6 bosses. Between waves 1 - 5 of a stage you fight the indifferent mobs and at stage 6 you take on the boss. A lot of people complain about the difficulty which I do believe is there, for a while atleast. Once you get the patterns of the bosses down it gets easier. Similar to Dark Souls (don't kill me please) mixed with Ninja Gaiden. Really the hardest part of the game for me is the mobs at the higher difficulties. Even when you get their patterns down the sheer number of them at times can throw me off. Of coarse I plan to change that as I only have 10 hours in and am planning on getting all the emotes, backgrounds, badges, cards, and acheivements for the game.\n\nThe mechanics are pretty solid for me. I don't have much experience with this genre so I can't go in further details other than I find them very enjoyable. Fluid for the most part and plenty of defensive options that that are hard for me to get down and pat (i.e counter, flourish, just guard).\n\nStory very linear but that doesn't matter to much with this kind of game. Cute girls, hard bosses, fluid combat, high combos. What's not to like about this game? How ever I have to say even if people like the Hack and Slash nature of the game it is VERY linear. You are set in an arena with changing back grounds after every boss fight. Enemy moddles are mostly the same but I don't mind that. For $2.50 or even the full price I would highly recommend this game, as I am enjoying it imensly.

The main characters may look nice and I'd expect them to have been the main selling point, but the gameplay itself is lacking.\n\nThe stages are all set on circular arenas with only the arena texture, the models surrounding the arena and the enemy waves varying. There aren't many different enemy times outside palette switched ones - cyborg(?) men in suits, large cyborgs, some cyborgs wielding a huge blade and some armored knight-lookalike. Sure, at least the two first have palette switches that denote different attacks, but the enemies are sorely lacking in variety. The phases before the level end boss are in general pushovers and I've managed to clear them (on normal difficulty) pretty well just mashing two buttons (sword slash and sword sheathing).\n\nKilled enemies earn the player skill points which can be used to purchase new skills and upgrade old ones - not that there are all that many of them. I'd think Streets of Rage had more different moves than Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae has.\n\nWhereas the fodders are way too easy, the bosses are in comparison very hard. Prepare to die by their hand several times - until you figure out that maxing out the sword sheathing and the special counter skill allows you to beat the enemies just by retrying the battle until you've managed to time your counters to enemy attacks the necessary 3-5 times to kill off the opponent. I still have trouble beating even the first two bosses, yet I've managed to complete the game (on normal difficulty).\n\nOn hard difficulty, the fodders become challenging as well and even the first level can cause trouble.\n\n(EDITED: Added the note about hard difficulty and the fourth common enemy type.)","March 16, 2014","false","8.6"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","16","32","0","0"

And while the action is certainly white knuckle, with numerous combos and upgradeable skills, it's the intricately detailed and complex narrative that will have you talking about Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae long after the credits have rolled.\n\nOn the surface, it's about two teenage girls crossing swords in a battle to the death. But if you dig deep enough, you discover that the developers are actually commenting on the societal pressures that adolescent females in Japan must wade through each and every day. The struggle of Misa is one of innocence and purity versus the seductive lure of moral bankrupcy. Or perhaps....it is Suzuka the player should sympathize with. The girl that shuns forced traditions in a quest to establish her own identity.\n\nNo matter which way you look at it, this is the game that The Fullbright Company (Gone Home) wished they had created.","July 4, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Learning and leveling up skills requires hours of collecting in-game currency, but since the core gameplay is all about beating up the same 6 repeating enemy types, you might be too bored with that to notice that the game's a huge grindfest. Throw in some bizarre input commands for special moves, and you've got a recipe for a cumbersome game that is in no way worth the effort it requires. Even if you summon the superhuman amount of patience it takes to learn the intricacies of this game, there's nothing to do but Story Mode. The addition of something as simple as a survival mode could have redeemed this game by at least some measure, but the developer found it more appropriate to put that sort of effort into modeling perfectly heart-shaped butts.

That story is once again reminiscent of older arcade games, and is packed 100% with action anime tropes of course.\n\nIf you're good with brawlers you might finish it in two hours. Or even less.\n\nHowever, beating the game unlocks harder difficulties which are so much harder, that it almost starts feeling like you're playing an entirely different game. (I am pretty sure I will not be able to beat the hardest setting actually XD).\nThere is also a grind quest to unlock new anime-classic costumes by earning points, it seems this quest seems to require around 10 game completions.\n\nThe conclusion is that these incentives to keep playing might be worthless to you, as they only matter if you like the game enough to keep playing after the first run.\n\nSo, would I recommend a two-hour-to-beat-once game?\nWell, in this case, yes.\n\nIt's only two hours, but those are quite awesome and entertaining, especially if you're into anime.\nThe character, Misa, does't have a huge number of moves, but it's more about mastering them. All of the moves are useful and truly mandatory in harder difficulties. In my humble opinion, this is better design than having a huge moveset that you only use at 30% of its potential.\n\nI know for sure that I had more fun with this game than with some hi-budget brawlers. I recommend it for anime and brawler fans especially. However, avoid like plague if you hate anime clichés.\n\nAnd also : to truly enjoy this game, you NEED a controller. Preferably with twin analog sticks to have best control of Misa and the camera at the same time.","September 18, 2015","true","16.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Using your sword skills, you fight rounds of enemies in an arena styled environment until you reach the boss of the level.  Repeat this again for more levels and that basically sums up the game.  There's a story but it's very simple and barely the focus of the game.  But the point of hack and slash games don't have to lie in story, it's in the combat although having a nice story is always a treat.\n\nYou start off with a very simple sword skillset and as you defeat more enemies you can unlock more skills or make your existing skills stronger.  Unfortunately the enemies aren't very varied, with many just being variations of the same types with more health and more damage with one or two new moves along with a different colored model.  This means that hitting enemies can start feeling like a chore as they become tankier and aren't as visually exciting.  The actual fun part of the swordplay lies in the counter system where perfectly timed counters deal massive damage to the enemies.  Because of the small window available for performing the counter, the first attempts will most likely end up in failure but once done correctly, it's immensely satisfying.  Even after finishing the game, I still find it fairly difficult to do.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game with the caveat that you should like hack and slash games a lot and will find it more fun if you perform counters correctly.  Otherwise if you're looking for a Dynasty Warriors game, you won't find it in this.  Hopefully if the developers makes another game in the series, they'll expand the weapon types and the variety of enemies as well as create a larger, more interesting environment to fight in.","November 29, 2014","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Their designs are neat, but you can never really tell what attacks of theirs you CAN'T block.  The controls are a bit sluggish but I guess they were going for the "hard to master" approach, or smooth things out with the level system.  The moves you can get very early on start to help out, and then the upgrades just soar you into hack and slash queendom.\n\nGood to numb your brain, nothing too complex.  The only thing really challenging is learning what each boss does and dying a few times before you get which attacks you can't block or counter.  Keep me in the wave arenas.  The bosses are just something to change the pace, but they're annoying.

I do not know how well the game plays on a keyboard.\n\nFantastico:\n+ tight controls and fluid gameplay\n+ fun boss fights\n+ runs well and is super flashy\n+ satisfying challenge\n\nLame:\n- repetitive at times\n- pretty barebones experience\n\n-----\nLess simply,\n\nMKH is a very straightforward hack and slash game. There's no exploration to speak of, no weapon to wield other than your trusty katana, and MKH's story doesn't really try to do anything beyond creating a reason for you to cut some dudes. But you know what? That's all okay. MKH does the hack and slash in "hack and slash" well.\n\nExpect to fight legions upon legions of varied opposition, and don't expect them to be all that easy to dispatch. Because of the difficulty of these fights, the game's sense of impact, and your flashy moves, cutting into MKH's enemy hordes is very satisfying. However, the composition of a horde only switches with each new wave, and each wave lasts for quite a decent amount of time, so fighting normal baddies is prone to becoming a stale experience.\n\nFortunately, the boss fights, which come after every five waves of typical baddies, do a good job of breaking up any monotony. These fights are easily the highlight of the game. They're the kind of fights where, even if you win by the skin of your teeth, you will want to retry for a more convincing more flashy result. They're so much fun to play. Be ready for boss fights that will test your reactions, timing, and adaptability. In particular, the fights with the main antagonist, Suzuka, are a complete blast to play.\n\nMKH is a short game as it doesn't feature any extra modes or content, but, if you love a challenge, the game is highly replayable thanks to its multiple difficulty settings.\n\nIn the end, MKH is a super solid game. The controls are tight, the action is fluid, and the enemy encounters demand that you devise some semblance of a strategy to face them. If you're a fan of hack and slash games, give MKH a try.","March 5, 2015","true","15.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is entirely focused on the combat, missions are about 5 waves of enemies on the same circular platform then a boss.  Controls are reponsive and a plethra of tightly timed counters makes for some allowances for quick paced combat which is not fully explored even on inferno (hardest difficulty unlocked after clearing hard and harder difficulty).  It contains all of the elements of a great hack and slash with nothing unique, but also nothing confusing or inhibitive.\n\nArt style is clear, but uncreative.  Rather cynically I believe it was a choice mostly to expand the audience cheaply and effectively.  There is a story which is a stereo typically childhood friends turned cop vs robber.\n\nOverall I would get this game if you are looking for another hack and slash or if you are interested if watching school girls  fighting with swords.","March 17, 2015","true","10.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So instead let’s just stick with pantsu may cry because you basically play as Vergil, the level format is similar to bloody palace and like the 4th game most of the budget and development time went into the combat system and nothing else.\n\nThe story is… there… occasionally, you play as Misa, a sword priestess cutting down waves of demons as she tries to catch her classmate who has been corrupted by the demon sword, that’s about all there is to it. There’s nothing interesting about the plot but it’s so simple and very rarely rears its head that it never becomes a detriment to the game.\n\nThe combat on the other hand is the sole reason to buy this game. Misa’s move set revolves entirely around her katana, her hand to hand attacks charge up a bar that allows her to use standard katana attacks as well as more powerful attacks with more range that have to be charged. The stand out superstar of this combat system however is her sheathing mechanic.\n\nIf you’ve watched enough anime in your life, you may be well aware of the cliché of sword fights where the finishing blow only appears once the winner sheaths their sword. Pantsu may cry translates this trope wonderfully into gameplay, if an enemy takes enough damage they start flashing red, Misa can then sheath her sword causing them to take more damage as well dropping health and spirit money that is used to upgrade her combat. As well as being as flashy as hell, it’s quite useful for staggering enemies as well as getting health without going through the effort of killing enemies, in fact enemies/bosses that would previously block Misa’s attacks without staggering can be stunned and juggled once they start flashing red which provides players an opportunity to go ballistic on an enemy that use to be a pain in their side.\n\nThere is no level design, you fight enemies in waves on a circular platform with an environment that occasionally change between fights, but just like the story that just means it doesn’t interfere. Most of the enemies and bosses are petty uninteresting with the exception of Suzuka, Misa’s classmate, who makes a great final boss with a fairly deep move set with attacks that have similar starting animations making them difficult to telegraph.\n\nMy one gripe with the combat is that there is no lock-on, so with no real method to focus on a single target, some of Misa’s attacks will go in a completely different direction than intended, also some attacks don’t string together, there are times when there’s that awkward pause between combos because the attack you inputted requires your katana to be sheathed, it’s an unnecessary nuance that convinces you to switch between hand to hand and katana attacks but it’s very minor and might not even be noticed on a 1st playthrough.\n\nThis game doesn’t have the depth of other hack n slash games such as Devil may cry and anything platinum makes, but it’s a £7 game that lasts around 4 hours and it’s great to play in between games. I hope this sheathing mechanic carries on to other games and I’ll gladly recommend it to anyone provided they’re aware that the combat is the only part of substance to the game.","March 28, 2015","true","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That's this game in a nutshell.\n\n"No game, actually, I clearly was not hit and I shouldn't have died. I have footage, you're wrong."\n"Actually, game, contrary to what you believe, I did press the button at the right time."\n\nThese are things you might hear yourself saying while playing this. The last boss is particularly guilty of just being wrong: your super powerful retaliation move must be pressed "just before the enemy's attack connects" (super specific description there dev). The problem with the last boss's final form (yes, this is one of THOSE...) is that the solid parts of her are covered by an imprecise particle effect; you cannot actually see when the attack connects and I wouldn't be surprised to find out that the attack's collision detection is completely random.\n\nI'm only half joking. There are many moments in my time playing this game where I felt the established mechanics were ignored, and there aren't any design features implemented to help the player learn from their mistakes. Then again, this is an indie game from a very small team, and in that light it's a very impressive creation. I had fun playing (until I reached the last boss on Normal), and there really aren't enough games that push your reflexes to the limit. If you like that type of game, highly recommended- just be prepared for indie level design and polish.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nList of problems in no particular order:\nThere aren't that many moves, and there are very clearly two or three "correct" moves that you should sink your experience points into, or you're going to have a bad time.\nSince there are only a few "correct" moves, the gameplay isn't incredibly varied and can get a tad monotonous. However, the game is short enough that I didn't get bored with it before clearing Easy+Normal. I intend to clear Hard, haven't started yet.\nWhen you get to the final boss in particular, there's really only one viable move: the very hard to time counter. I had fun fighting the boss on Easy, but on Normal, anything other than the counter isn't worth doing (until the boss is bleeding), so the fight is just you standing around being pummled, praying the counter will work at least four times (in addition to the game being wrong about timing, the counter attack is not guaranteed to hit) and hoping the boss doesn't use ranged attacks....\nThis game was meant to be played starting on Easy, then you level up your character and continue onto the harder difficulties. This is not explained or hinted at, and you're allowed to pick any difficulty from the start. If you, like me, always choose the hardest difficulty for every game you play, you're just not going to have fun. The experience will be frustrating, boring, monotonous, and victory will just not feel rewarding. It took me months of infrequent sessions of this game to finally swallow my pride and select Easy... Where I more readily learned the game's mechanics, and I discovered that your level carries over to new games- I previously thought you just started each game with a blank slate.\nI found the terminology to be a bit difficult to process. Everything has its own fancy name and not necessarily helpful icons. The icons are almost color coded to what would be the colors of the 360 gamepad, which kept throwing me off, and while there is a picture of the controller on the button mapping screen, the icons of each move are not pictured in that screen. What a mess. The move descriptions aren't the clearest translations... None of this was particularly intuitive. Be prepared to put forth some effort to get past the learning curve.\nGame's engine is artificially limited to 60fps","February 12, 2015","true","12.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In the early stages, it has far more interesting combos.\n\nEssentially the plot of the game is, you are a schoolgirl, fighting motorcycle helmetted dudes in suits. I think they're supposed to be robots...which are spawned by a demon sword, which is used by your best friend.\n\nPros:\nBoss fights - on inferno.\nYou can live out your sword wielding schoolgirl fantasy.\nPantsu.\nVery satisfying perfect guard/flourish. Very difficult timing.\nSheathing the sword is badass (and also is your strongest attack, provided you have max zeal).\n\nCons:\nHigher diff's and non-boss waves are a lot of "run in circles, spam one button, finisher, run in circles".\nZero story.\nZero stage variation.\nLast boss is impossible if you don't flourish, a joke if you do.\nFairly grindy level up system.\n\nI'd recommend it if you're looking for a decently challenging arcade style game. Its basically a lower investment DMC/Bayonetta. More technical (fewer parry frames) than those games however, and more punishing. The bottom line is, I had fun playing it, and if you see it on sale for cheap, its worth a buy.\n\nHint: learn to flourish early. If you don't, good luck on inferno.\n\nBIG HINT: If you are used to leaning the stick towards the enemy, do not buy sonic slash or flash kick. These change your combo while moving, into a (imo) incredibly bad combo. Sonic slash has a HUGE afterswing delay, tiny hit stun, and is strictly worse than the standard sword combo. Flash kick sets up an aerial combo...which is just bad. Stay on the ground people. You have been warned. There is NO way (aside from starting a new game) to remove these upgrades once you purchase them.","March 6, 2015","true","11.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, the sword action is fast and responsive. The ugrades you gain will challenge you in to finding what slash can cancel in to which kick in order to continue an unbroken chain of attacks.

A simple enough arcade game with a level of complexity somewhere between The Bouncer for PS2 and Devil May Cry 4, though requiring the precision and focus of an Onimusha game.  The gameplay is fast, frenetic and chaotic, while remaining mostly clean and not frustrating at all.\n\nThe story's lacklustre, sure; A presumed order of demon hunting templars houses an evil sword.  One of the students steals it, another pursues her.  End of story.  Don't go expecting much in the way of tears or feels and the like here folks, we're in it for one thing: Hardcore fantasy samurai action.\n\nIn terms of aesthetics, you play as a full thighed woman in a short skirt with a long sword against somewhat unimaginative enemies (Swordsmonster in a suit, cyborg swordmonster, almost Berserker from Fate/Stay Night, a knight), with a relatively uninspired soundtrack.  The characters voices only rarely venture towards annoying, which helps, and the attack sounds are alright enough.\n\nOverall, for a game made by one dude and a coupla voice actresses, this is a helluva product.

Upon starting up the game, you are given a 2-minute blurb of generic short-skirt anime-babe save-the-world mumbo jumbo, then thrown into a fight with a bunch of samurai robots in business suits. Combat initially feels jerky and stilted, and the enemy AI is less than stellar. Mere moments into the action, my expectations were rapidly hitting rock-bottom, but I decided to play on. Fortunately, the game gets its act together soon enough.\n\nIgnoring the story entirely, MKH is actually a competent, demanding arcade beat-em-up. Each stage places you in a circular arena, in which you must take down five waves of opponents, each more difficult than the last, capped with a boss monster. While combat initially feels sluggish, and the early enemies are laughable, both problems solve themselves in short order. You eventually start to grasp the nuances of the combat system, allowing a skilled player to duck and weave in and out of combat, hammering foes with punches and sword slices, leaving the opponents a bloody wreck, all without ever giving them a chance to strike back. Later foes block and even counter your attacks, brutally punishing you if you attempt to button mash and forcing you to fight cautiously. They also don't all look like murderous C-3P0s, which helps the aesthetic tremendously.\n\nOpponents that have been damaged enough start flashing red, signifying that they are now more vulnerable to your basic attacks and are also capable of being instantly defeated through use of your cinematic sword-sheathing magic. Slaying enemies grants you SP, which you can spend to buy upgraded skills or better durability, as well as occasionally offering up big blobs of health. All in all, MKH is goofier than it intends to be, a bit repetitive, and doesn't exactly have the most complicated system in the world, but it's still a fun bit of slice-em-up action to burn an afternoon with.","August 10, 2014","true","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Finally, normal enemies are fodder for you and it's all about learning to react to each boss' telegraphed attacks.\n\nThe final difficulty is supposed to be painful but when you learn a certain holy technique you can exploit, you can just breeze through the game until the bosses.

You eventually just have to learn how to use defensive manuevers and flourishes and suddenly the game's beyond easy, but until you get good you'll be tearing your hair out. If you don't like DMC style games you'll hate this and that would be totally understandable.\n\nDon't buy it unless it's under $5, or get it via the Humble Bundle along with a bunch of other stuff (it's available at this time.)","August 12, 2014","true","8.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

At first I didn't know what was going on but once you get the hang of the mechanics fun and do some upgrading it gets a bit enjoyable.  The best way to describe it is like a very, very watered down version of Ninja Gaiden 3 (xbox/ps3), kind of like a very early, early  prototype of that game.  DO NOT BUY AT FULL PRICE, it is not worth more than 2 or 3 dollars at most, as you will play it for a couple of hours, beat it and probably delete it off your computer or forget it's in your library.\n\nIf you want to know what it consists of:\n\nYou are placed in an arena-like area where you fight enemies in an enclosed space.  You defeat a certain number of "waves" of enemies then boss fight -> cut scene -> repeat.  I'm having fun playing it but this game is really very limited in its execution and after a few upgrades you will plow through everything.  I recommend it only when it's on sale - if not you won't miss much.  It does have a silly charm to it - when playing it, I felt that with some more development, play testing, balance and variety, it could have been a more highly recommended game.","September 8, 2015","true","8.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The sound design is sparce, the levels are always large, circular arenas, there's only a couple tracks of music in the game, the story is tacked on, and there's only a around 10-15 enemies. That being said, the one place that it isn't barebones is the actual combat. It's quick, frantic, and satisfying with the potential for an incredibly high skill cap if someone were to dedicate enough time to it. If you're looking for a a large game that you can sink dozens of hours into finding secrets and new areas, look somewhere else. However, if you're looking for a game with an insane amount of mechanical depth, buy this.\n\nI'll put it this way: If you'd consider paying 2.50-10 dollars for a version of DMC3/4 that only contained the Bloody Palace, then buy this immediately.","June 18, 2015","true","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/parsignia/recommended/263620/","parsignia","Paparsley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/parsignia/","350 products in account","Everything about this game is incredibly barebones. The sound design is sparce, the levels are always large, circular arenas, there's only a couple tracks of music in the game, the story is tacked on, and there's only a around 10-15 enemies. That being said, the one place that it isn't barebones is the actual combat. It's quick, frantic, and satisfying with the potential for an incredibly high skill cap if someone were to dedicate enough time to it. If you're looking for a a large game that you can sink dozens of hours into finding secrets and new areas, look somewhere else. However, if you're looking for a game with an insane amount of mechanical depth, buy this.\n\nI'll put it this way: If you'd consider paying 2.50-10 dollars for a version of DMC3/4 that only contained the Bloody Palace, then buy this immediately.","June 18, 2015","true","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you like a game with deep storyline this game is not for you.\n\nGameplay : This is a basic Hack & Slash game where you have to fight waves of enemies before you fight the boss. You will face several type of enemies with different abilities and gain SP points when you kill the enemies to buy upgrade for you character. It is repetitive as you fight wave after wave but the challenge and fun is still there . The combat system is I think the most enjoyable feature of this game. Start form basic attack from the beginning then you will get new attack/skill when you upgrade your character. This new skill will add new way and combo for you to defeat you enemy. Some of this skill are very straightforward & some will required skill & practice to master it. This may make you want to replay the game on harder difficulty (or probably the same) just to test this new skill/move you unlock. The boss of this game can be annoying if you not pay enough attention to its movement and pattern. Pay enough attention it will be walk in a park.\n\nMusic & Voice Acting : Average…\n\nOverall : It is a very fun game to play. Especially when you manage to unlock all upgrade for you character. I really recommend this game if you want to play a simple yet fun beat em up game and my rating of this game is 7/10\n","October 27, 2015","true","14.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Art-wise, it's fine. Liked the animations, the designs of the enemies have this neat robot theme, and the girls are cute even with the ecchi. Backgrounds and arenas are nothing to write home about. A big circle for the arena, backgrounds change but aren't that impressive.\nThe story barely exists, your friend has an evil sword and you want to save her. Done, whatever, moving on.\nControls are finicky, playing this game on a mouse and keyboard is impossible. It's designed for a controller and nothing but. The tutorial and interface are also a problem, they tell you to hit certain attacks without button prompts.\n\nAll that aside, when you do have a controller and know how things work, things get fun. The system allows for a lot of insane combos and bouncing around. You can block, but it's actually better not to since it kills the flow. Bosses are insanely hard and become a lot of fun if that sort of challenge doesn't aggrevate you. Enemies start off from peons you step on to to behemoths that pose a fair challenge in their own right. Difficulty spikes up quickly enough to keep things interesting.\n\nFor me, the buy was worth it based on the art and gameplay. It doesn't price itself too high so it's worth it if you like these sorts of games.

The game have game play and mechanics similar to Oneechanbara and Ninja Gaiden 2 but add the "tate" system from Shinobi to the formula too.\n\nThe game can be difficult for people that have not experience in games like Ninja Gaiden or Shinobi. You will need to use the block button, run, dodge and use crowd control in order to survive every wave also the recommended is to start on Easy and collect all the skills on your first walk-through the move to normal when you have all the upgrades.\n\nThe game also change the amount of enemies that you get in each wave if you select Normal or Hard and on Hard you will fight more aggressive enemies and the bosses have one "super move" available too.\n\nOverall a good game and worth even a price of $10 or $15 but for $2.50 it was a really good deal!","June 27, 2014","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's a small ongoing storyline that doesn't make a huge amount of sense, but the main idea of the game is to slash your way hoardes of enemies, playing as Japanese school girls.\n\nThe difficulty does soon start to ramp up, but exploring different actions and what not is pretty interesting.

The control system for this game has the camera controlled by the keyboard, and the attack skills have absolutely no variation besides the original two or three swipes.\n\nThe skills themselves are completely broken, as you can kick enemies up in the air and kick them back down while staying invicible. Other skills simply hit every enemy around you, stunning them and slowly killing them.\n\nOverall the gameplay is boring and repetitive, and only a Call of Duty player could ever find it even slightly amusing\n0/10 Would play again","June 24, 2014","true","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Art-wise, it's fine. Liked the animations, the designs of the enemies have this neat robot theme, and the girls are cute even with the ecchi. Backgrounds and arenas are nothing to write home about. A big circle for the arena, backgrounds change but aren't that impressive.\nThe story barely exists, your friend has an evil sword and you want to save her. Done, whatever, moving on.\nControls are finicky, playing this game on a mouse and keyboard is impossible. It's designed for a controller and nothing but. The tutorial and interface are also a problem, they tell you to hit certain attacks without button prompts.\n\nAll that aside, when you do have a controller and know how things work, things get fun. The system allows for a lot of insane combos and bouncing around. You can block, but it's actually better not to since it kills the flow. Bosses are insanely hard and become a lot of fun if that sort of challenge doesn't aggrevate you. Enemies start off from peons you step on to to behemoths that pose a fair challenge in their own right. Difficulty spikes up quickly enough to keep things interesting.\n\nFor me, the buy was worth it based on the art and gameplay. It doesn't price itself too high so it's worth it if you like these sorts of games. Getting it on sale is fine, but you can't argue with an asking price of $15 for this level of challenge.","June 27, 2014","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game have game play and mechanics similar to Oneechanbara and Ninja Gaiden 2 but add the "tate" system from Shinobi to the formula too.\n\nThe game can be difficult for people that have not experience in games like Ninja Gaiden or Shinobi. You will need to use the block button, run, dodge and use crowd control in order to survive every wave also the recommended is to start on Easy and collect all the skills on your first walk-through the move to normal when you have all the upgrades.\n\nThe game also change the amount of enemies that you get in each wave if you select Normal or Hard and on Hard you will fight more aggressive enemies and the bosses have one "super move" available too.\n\nOverall a good game and worth even a price of $10 or $15 but for $2.50 it was a really good deal!","June 27, 2014","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Keyboard controls by default are REALLY bad and somehow they didn't consider the mouse for controls?\n\nThe game itself isn't bad if you're just looking to kill time in between long hours of other stuff. $10.99 might not be the right pricetag though.

Hack and Slash - This game is very stress-releasing at the same time rage-inducing. Stress-releasing because when you think of your boss and hate him, play this game; rage-inducing is when you die over and over again in the 2nd boss and decided to quit instead.\n2. Panties - Recommended for weeabs who likes school girl uniforms and panties. These otakus love to see Misa tumble around and don't care about her dying because they've alredy won. They saw the panties. lol.\n3. Japanese game - Requires alot of grinding if you want to upgrade Misa like those vicious slashes and kicks. This level system allows your character to become stronger when things become difficult like the stage bosses. If you have fully upgraded the character and still defeated by the boss, forget about gaming.","December 23, 2014","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You'll need a lot of patience and good reaction time to get to the end.  When you kill enemies you get SP which can be used to level up your attacks and upgrade your skills which will make fighting bosses a bit easier.  Even after you beat the game, you can go back for new game+ and finish upgrading your moves, or if you want you can save up 100,000 SP to get the alternate costumes for your character.

That's this game in a nutshell.\n\n"No game, actually, I clearly was not hit and I shouldn't have died. I have footage, you're wrong."\n"Actually, game, contrary to what you believe, I did press the button at the right time."\n\nThese are things you might hear yourself saying while playing this. The last boss is particularly guilty of just being wrong: your super powerful retaliation move must be pressed "just before the enemy's attack connects" (super specific description there dev). The problem with the last boss's final form (yes, this is one of THOSE...) is that the solid parts of her are covered by an imprecise particle effect; you cannot actually see when the attack connects and I wouldn't be surprised to find out that the attack's collision detection is completely random.\n\nI'm only half joking. There are many moments in my time playing this game where I felt the established mechanics were ignored, and there aren't any design features implemented to help the player learn from their mistakes. Then again, this is an indie game from a very small team, and in that light it's a very impressive creation. I had fun playing (until I reached the last boss on Normal), and there really aren't enough games that push your reflexes to the limit. If you like that type of game, highly recommended- just be prepared for indie level design and polish.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nList of problems in no particular order:\nThere aren't that many moves, and there are very clearly two or three "correct" moves that you should sink your experience points into, or you're going to have a bad time.\nSince there are only a few "correct" moves, the gameplay isn't incredibly varied and can get a tad monotonous. However, the game is short enough that I didn't get bored with it before clearing Easy+Normal. I intend to clear Hard, haven't started yet.\nWhen you get to the final boss in particular, there's really only one viable move: the very hard to time counter. I had fun fighting the boss on Easy, but on Normal, anything other than the counter isn't worth doing (until the boss is bleeding), so the fight is just you standing around being pummled, praying the counter will work at least four times (in addition to the game being wrong about timing, the counter attack is not guaranteed to hit) and hoping the boss doesn't use ranged attacks....\nThis game was meant to be played starting on Easy, then you level up your character and continue onto the harder difficulties. This is not explained or hinted at, and you're allowed to pick any difficulty from the start. If you, like me, always choose the hardest difficulty for every game you play, you're just not going to have fun. The experience will be frustrating, boring, monotonous, and victory will just not feel rewarding. It took me months of infrequent sessions of this game to finally swallow my pride and select Easy... Where I more readily learned the game's mechanics, and I discovered that your level carries over to new games- I previously thought you just started each game with a blank slate.\nI found the terminology to be a bit difficult to process. Everything has its own fancy name and not necessarily helpful icons. The icons are almost color coded to what would be the colors of the 360 gamepad, which kept throwing me off, and while there is a picture of the controller on the button mapping screen, the icons of each move are not pictured in that screen. What a mess. The move descriptions aren't the clearest translations... None of this was particularly intuitive. Be prepared to put forth some effort to get past the learning curve.\nGame's engine is artificially limited to 60fps","February 12, 2015","true","12.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The replayability of this game is low after beating the hard mode or (if you can) very hard mode. About the price of the game, i think its worth while on sale (i got it while 80% off), its because of the game replayability.

I do not know how well the game plays on a keyboard.\n\nFantastico:\n+ tight controls and fluid gameplay\n+ fun boss fights\n+ runs well and is super flashy\n+ satisfying challenge\n\nLame:\n- repetitive at times\n- pretty barebones experience\n\n-----\nLess simply,\n\nMKH is a very straightforward hack and slash game. There's no exploration to speak of, no weapon to wield other than your trusty katana, and MKH's story doesn't really try to do anything beyond creating a reason for you to cut some dudes. But you know what? That's all okay. MKH does the hack and slash in "hack and slash" well.\n\nExpect to fight legions upon legions of varied opposition, and don't expect them to be all that easy to dispatch. Because of the difficulty of these fights, the game's sense of impact, and your flashy moves, cutting into MKH's enemy hordes is very satisfying. However, the composition of a horde only switches with each new wave, and each wave lasts for quite a decent amount of time, so fighting normal baddies is prone to becoming a stale experience.\n\nFortunately, the boss fights, which come after every five waves of typical baddies, do a good job of breaking up any monotony. These fights are easily the highlight of the game. They're the kind of fights where, even if you win by the skin of your teeth, you will want to retry for a more convincing more flashy result. They're so much fun to play. Be ready for boss fights that will test your reactions, timing, and adaptability. In particular, the fights with the main antagonist, Suzuka, are a complete blast to play.\n\nMKH is a short game as it doesn't feature any extra modes or content, but, if you love a challenge, the game is highly replayable thanks to its multiple difficulty settings.\n\nIn the end, MKH is a super solid game. The controls are tight, the action is fluid, and the enemy encounters demand that you devise some semblance of a strategy to face them. If you're a fan of hack and slash games, give MKH a try.","March 5, 2015","true","15.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So instead let’s just stick with pantsu may cry because you basically play as Vergil, the level format is similar to bloody palace and like the 4th game most of the budget and development time went into the combat system and nothing else.\n\nThe story is… there… occasionally, you play as Misa, a sword priestess cutting down waves of demons as she tries to catch her classmate who has been corrupted by the demon sword, that’s about all there is to it. There’s nothing interesting about the plot but it’s so simple and very rarely rears its head that it never becomes a detriment to the game.\n\nThe combat on the other hand is the sole reason to buy this game. Misa’s move set revolves entirely around her katana, her hand to hand attacks charge up a bar that allows her to use standard katana attacks as well as more powerful attacks with more range that have to be charged. The stand out superstar of this combat system however is her sheathing mechanic.\n\nIf you’ve watched enough anime in your life, you may be well aware of the cliché of sword fights where the finishing blow only appears once the winner sheaths their sword. Pantsu may cry translates this trope wonderfully into gameplay, if an enemy takes enough damage they start flashing red, Misa can then sheath her sword causing them to take more damage as well dropping health and spirit money that is used to upgrade her combat. As well as being as flashy as hell, it’s quite useful for staggering enemies as well as getting health without going through the effort of killing enemies, in fact enemies/bosses that would previously block Misa’s attacks without staggering can be stunned and juggled once they start flashing red which provides players an opportunity to go ballistic on an enemy that use to be a pain in their side.\n\nThere is no level design, you fight enemies in waves on a circular platform with an environment that occasionally change between fights, but just like the story that just means it doesn’t interfere. Most of the enemies and bosses are petty uninteresting with the exception of Suzuka, Misa’s classmate, who makes a great final boss with a fairly deep move set with attacks that have similar starting animations making them difficult to telegraph.\n\nMy one gripe with the combat is that there is no lock-on, so with no real method to focus on a single target, some of Misa’s attacks will go in a completely different direction than intended, also some attacks don’t string together, there are times when there’s that awkward pause between combos because the attack you inputted requires your katana to be sheathed, it’s an unnecessary nuance that convinces you to switch between hand to hand and katana attacks but it’s very minor and might not even be noticed on a 1st playthrough.\n\nThis game doesn’t have the depth of other hack n slash games such as Devil may cry and anything platinum makes, but it’s a £7 game that lasts around 4 hours and it’s great to play in between games. I hope this sheathing mechanic carries on to other games and I’ll gladly recommend it to anyone provided they’re aware that the combat is the only part of substance to the game.","March 28, 2015","true","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The Options menu even feels like it has a Japanese accent. If you're looking for story, this probably isn't the best game for that. If you're looking for a Hack'N'Slash, this is a great game. It places you in a circular areana, facing waves of enemies. A key part is making the enemies bleed as that affects how they fight. It's pretty hard at first, and the tuturial doesn't help too much. You can figure it out on your own, it's just going to take a bit. Overall this is a fun game if you like Hack'N'Slash games, but if you aren't quite into those I would defenitly steer clear of this one.","November 7, 2014","true","34.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In the early stages, it has far more interesting combos.\n\nEssentially the plot of the game is, you are a schoolgirl, fighting motorcycle helmetted dudes in suits. I think they're supposed to be robots...which are spawned by a demon sword, which is used by your best friend.\n\nPros:\nBoss fights - on inferno.\nYou can live out your sword wielding schoolgirl fantasy.\nPantsu.\nVery satisfying perfect guard/flourish. Very difficult timing.\nSheathing the sword is badass (and also is your strongest attack, provided you have max zeal).\n\nCons:\nHigher diff's and non-boss waves are a lot of "run in circles, spam one button, finisher, run in circles".\nZero story.\nZero stage variation.\nLast boss is impossible if you don't flourish, a joke if you do.\nFairly grindy level up system.\n\nI'd recommend it if you're looking for a decently challenging arcade style game. Its basically a lower investment DMC/Bayonetta. More technical (fewer parry frames) than those games however, and more punishing. The bottom line is, I had fun playing it, and if you see it on sale for cheap, its worth a buy.\n\nHint: learn to flourish early. If you don't, good luck on inferno.\n\nBIG HINT: If you are used to leaning the stick towards the enemy, do not buy sonic slash or flash kick. These change your combo while moving, into a (imo) incredibly bad combo. Sonic slash has a HUGE afterswing delay, tiny hit stun, and is strictly worse than the standard sword combo. Flash kick sets up an aerial combo...which is just bad. Stay on the ground people. You have been warned. There is NO way (aside from starting a new game) to remove these upgrades once you purchase them.","March 6, 2015","true","11.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Art-wise, it's fine. Liked the animations, the designs of the enemies have this neat robot theme, and the girls are cute even with the ecchi. Backgrounds and arenas are nothing to write home about. A big circle for the arena, backgrounds change but aren't that impressive.\nThe story barely exists, your friend has an evil sword and you want to save her. Done, whatever, moving on.\nControls are finicky, playing this game on a mouse and keyboard is impossible. It's designed for a controller and nothing but. The tutorial and interface are also a problem, they tell you to hit certain attacks without button prompts.\n\nAll that aside, when you do have a controller and know how things work, things get fun. The system allows for a lot of insane combos and bouncing around. You can block, but it's actually better not to since it kills the flow. Bosses are insanely hard and become a lot of fun if that sort of challenge doesn't aggrevate you. Enemies start off from peons you step on to to behemoths that pose a fair challenge in their own right. Difficulty spikes up quickly enough to keep things interesting.\n\nFor me, the buy was worth it based on the art and gameplay. It doesn't price itself too high so it's worth it if you like these sorts of games. Getting it on sale is fine, but you can't argue with an asking price of $15 for this level of challenge.","June 27, 2014","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The Options menu even feels like it has a Japanese accent. If you're looking for story, this probably isn't the best game for that. If you're looking for a Hack'N'Slash, this is a great game. It places you in a circular areana, facing waves of enemies. A key part is making the enemies bleed as that affects how they fight. It's pretty hard at first, and the tuturial doesn't help too much. You can figure it out on your own, it's just going to take a bit. Overall this is a fun game if you like Hack'N'Slash games, but if you aren't quite into those I would defenitly steer clear of this one.","November 7, 2014","true","34.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But it just makes you go through, waves, through waves of eneimes, and it gets pretty tiring (after wave 4).

In order to use the counter or flourish skills you need to have perfect timing (which is not likely to happen a good percent of the time). Most of the basic enemies are simple to deal with, but once you reach enemies that dont get stunned until they "bleed" it becomes tedious.\nUnless you can master flourishing it becomes a game of hit and run. Also, the difficulty between the normal enemies and the bosses skyrockets. You will most likely die a few times before you get the hang of how to beat the boss.\n\nThough, I have to give the game some credit, For how cheap the game is it has well animated characters and the boss enemies look decent (though I cant say the same about the normal enemies). I think this game needs a bit of work but all-in-all is worth $10 if you have a little extra money burning a hole in you pocket.","January 11, 2015","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I should not be able to kill three enemies in a row with my eyes closed, especially when said enemies take a minute and a half each to kill.

Well what do you expect from a hack n slash about anime girls?\n-Extremely short campaign. I've beaten the whole thing multiple times on the hardest difficulty and I still only have 2 hours logged. My first play was about 45 minutes in length\n-A bit too easy. Even on the hardest difficulty few if any of the enemies pose a serious threat to a skilled player\n-Very small "arenas" for each stage rather than a full level. In each of these arenas designed to look like some location or another you see small snippets of the story in a cutscene, fight a few waves of enemies and then fight a boss. Very simple; but not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nIn summation: get it if you enjoy hacking and slashing, but wait until its on super sale, like 50-75% off would be fine.","August 26, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

That being said I love hack and slash games with a decent combat system. If you are the type of fan who is super into games like Bayonetta or Ninja giaden specifically for the combat then you might like this game. It has a simple time based/reflex based combat system where you simply combo enemies repeatdily and time your parries and counter attacks as you see them coming. The game rewards you for not getting hit by giving you charges for your holy attacks and red orbs when you kill enemies. All that being said I only recommend this game to pure action hack and slash enthusiast since this game is just basically you in a arena killing enemies in numerous waves until you get to the boss. There is no platforming or puzzles or any other basic extra type of game play you'd expect in a standard hack and slash game...just combat in a room/area. So far I've beaten 3 bosses. I've enjoyed the game for what it is and personally I think  Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae is better than DmC or ninja gaiden 3 despite it being a barebones and simple action game.","September 1, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

For it's price, this game is quite good. Especially if you picked it up during the Summer Sale, as I did.\n\nThe graphics are rather good, especially since the game is 300Mb in size or so. Unfortunately, there isn't much of a variety when it comes to enemy and level designs. Basically the levels are sealed arenas like the Bloody Palace mode in Devil May Cry games.\n\nThe soundtrack is ok, but it has only 3 songs and they get quite repetitive. After two hours I just switched the music off and went to my Metal Gear Risng and Devil May Cry soundtrack folders.\n\nGameplay and controls... controls are quite responsive and fast, you won't feel some sloppy reactions to your inputs. The gameplay is rather repetitve. No, you have different moves and techniques like blocking at the last moment to block a very powerful attack (similar to Royal Guard style from DMC3), different cancels, launcher attacks, dodges, but after finding a combo that is most effective for your playing style it all becomes quite repetitve.\n\nAll in all... it feels incomplete, like a tech demo. It's fun, don't get me wrong, but I would love to see these gameplay mechanics to be expanded in a more "complete" character action game.\n\nOh, and it can get quite difficult at times, especially on the final boss. Also, don't start at Hard mode, it exists as a NG+ type of mode, when you really need your upgraded skills.","July 3, 2014","true","6.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
