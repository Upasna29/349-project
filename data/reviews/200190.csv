For every breathtaking mural there's a dozen cheap tags ranging from the generic to profane. Similarly, Sideway: New York jumps violently between an abundantly stylish and creative platformer, to a cheap, controller hurling annoying one. Unfortunately, the imbalance often shifts toward the later, and even then the good parts only serve to highlight how frustrating the rest of the game is, which no amount of personality can save.\n\nBy now you've hopefully gathered that Sideway is based around graffiti, placing you running and jumping along cluttered walls, shifting from different panes and using parts of the environment to create a makeshift path toward the end. It's a really neat idea that's pulled off with a good deal of success, even when it's more often used for style than a core gameplay mechanic.\n\nThis is fine at first when everything is new and bursting with creativity, but Sideway falls on its face about halfway through by being at least twice as long as its content can sustain (which isn't saying much when it clocks in at just around 3 hours). Level designs start to repeat, backgrounds become less interesting as the originality wears off, and the 3-4 track soundtrack just keeps cycling through over and over (it will be going around in my head for days to come I'm sure). It also back loads most of its boss fights, which are easily among the most infuriating and poorly designed of any game I've played all year. Compared to the rest of the game, they create huge roadblocks that I wouldn't be surprised caused many players to simply give up on the game (which might honestly be for the best, as at that point the challenge is only going to keep rising).\n\nLater levels also begin to focus heavily on combat, which is clunky, boring, and by far the worst element of the game. It's hugely perplexing why the developer chose to put so much effort into this one portion of the experience, but it's clear they spent a good deal of time on it and all that's come from it is a lesser game than we might otherwise have seen.\n\nFor the first hour or so I was really digging everything about Sideway. Its style is great, the premise original, and the entire package bursting with personality. But the further I got the more it seemed to try and put me off the entire game, spoiling the experience that came before and causing me to rather despise the game by the end. I hope the developer gets a chance to make another game and learns from the mistakes made here, but I won't be disappointed if we never end up seeing a Sideway 2.","August 23, 2014","false","3.1"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","25","32","0","0"

There are some noticeable problems that would frustrate you, but if you do get the game working, it is an enjoyable game. If I recall, the game does not like multi-monitor setup, so you will have to disable all other monitors to play the game.

It tracks collectables on each stage (up to 100%, with rewards), but sometimes you'll have to restart the damn thing because the stage has branching paths and without going down one or another, you don't know which can be returned to and which is the one-way cannon forward in the level. Add in some frustrating sections that rely on "turn the level the right way" or "beat up one of the most annoying enemy types in the game" to proceed (there are plenty of these by the end) and it really seems like a game I'd love to have a sequel that fixes this crap but this is not really worth it for a lot of people unless you want to try rushing through an unfairly-designed platformer full of irritation.","July 16, 2012","false","5.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","3"

What bothers me about it is how bad they communicate anything to the player. I didnt even realise until the 4th level that I had a punch attack and I never needed it in the game, because i could just use the jump kick to kill anything. Another example of bad communication is the slug thing that you can stun and jump over. Any other enemy you can kill, but not this slug! Frustrating to say the least. It's also very hard to plan how to jump when you cant move the camera and just slightly see behind the next corner. The game is basicly a 2D game in 3D space, which is very awesome in theory. But it's also in some places frustrating when you the game dosent communicate very well what corners you can and cannot cross by, although I did realise there was a little indicator through what looked like a green 3D box sticking out. If you could move the camera around the corner and see what you're supposed to jump to, that'd be great. But you have to go around the corner, go back and then make the jump instead, in some places. The first boss also didnt come with a tutorial for me, so I had no idea what to do. I found out that I could jump on his head to stun him, and then he'd charge (ridicoulessly) fast at me. I ended up looking up on the net what to do, and even with that done, I got annoyed at how I didn't even have a split second to make the jump. I don't recommend this game as a result of that and what really felt like terrible level design to me.","October 14, 2014","false","2.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I was hoping that with the graffiti based art style that there would be more painting/tagging involved like Jet Set Radio. Sideway is really more of an old school platformer "collectathon" with a nice art style, head-boppin' rap music, and an intriguing yet a tad gimmicky "play on the walls of a building gameplay". It's easy, especially boss battles.  I finished this game in about 4 separate sittings no more than 64 minutes (not including all secret tags and collectibles).

The action  occurs on the sides of   three-dimensional buildings.   If Nox jumps off the edge of one wall, he  ends up on the wall around the corner;  this gives the levels a labyrinthine aspect.  It takes some getting used to initially, but the transitions are as smooth as silk.\n\nThe game also has  plenty of secrets, that  become  more elaborate as Nox’s abilities develop.

The mechanic of playing a 2D game on the sides of 3D buildings so you can wrap around and end up sideways in a previous section is kind of a neat idea, but it mostly ends up being problematic because it frequently makes it non-obvious how different sections are connected. The game also doesn't entirely feel smooth on what should be waaaay more than enough hardware to run it (i5 2500K@4.5GHz, 660 Ti, SSD, 1920x1200), even though FRAPS says it's sticking around 30fps with v-sync. It's not bad, but it's not that great either, which is kind of disappointing after they made Madballs in Babo Invasion, which was probably the only legitimate excuse to use the term "amazeballs" (See, because it was amazing, and it was about balls...get it?

The ideas behind Sideway New York are unique and fresh, even for a platforming action game. The artwork is distinctive, cartoony, and with an air of playfulness also. The level design is what sets the game aside from others of the same genre. It is a combination of two-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces with a novel way of going about the buildings and other structures. The game screen often flips and changes angles as you progress through each level, and you must find ways to jump, skip, slide, and pounce around the environment. All of these actions are not very fast paced, but they coincide with the game adequately, and in an enjoyable manner. The storyline is short and casual, not going very far away from the usual beat the bad guys who kidnapped my girlfriend fare, but this does not get in the way of game play gratification, as you will be mostly busy platforming and appreciating the levels and environments. As you advance through the game world, you will unlock special abilities that are both fun to use and applicable within the game world. They range from special attacks, to special jumps, and even gliding through the air. There is also the option of collecting tags in the levels, but this does not reflect any changes in the storyline or game play whatsoever. It is a mere collection mechanic for your own accomplishment and bragging rights. The ability of playing with a partner in local co-op is available, but I have not personally tried this. The soundtrack seems to have only about three or four songs that loop endlessly, which makes for quite the repetitive listening experience. On the other hand, it is done entirely by renowned underground hip hop artist from Boston, Mr. Lif. This means that depending on what your musical tastes are, you will be either pleased, neutral, or annoyed. Either way, the music may be turned off or kept on. There seems to be a serious bug with the options menu, as sometimes, it will not allow you to exit it and get back to the game. The only way to fix this major problem is to end the game in Task Manager; which also means you will lose all progress if you were mid-level. There are several instances during certain levels, which involve mechanics unique to Sideway New York that are slightly unintuitive, and the game does not do a very good job of explaining clearly how to go about accomplishing certain actions. This means there will be much trial and error before you are able to figure out how to approach some situations. The last two boss battles can be a bit frustrating, as they require several precision based actions, until you are finally successful. For a short and casual cartoony game, Sideway New York gets most what it is trying to accomplish right, and for what it is, it is quite enjoyable.\n\nSideway New York is good.","March 20, 2014","true","5.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Its gimmick is that you're a piece of living graffiti painted onto a building, which is visually cool but only occasionally affects gameplay. One way it's used is that the direction of gravity on the surface of a roof is decided by the direction the player entered the roof. This property could have been used to create some clever puzzles or mazes, but it never was.\n\nThe player starts the game with limited movement abilities, which makes the first few levels boring. Judging from the Steam achievements, about 40% of players got bored and quit between the first level and the first boss. Things pick up later on as the game introduces some standard abilities like double-jump, gliding, and swinging from grapple points, which allowed the designers to create more interesting and challenging platforming.\n\nA hip-hop soundtrack is provided by Mr. Lif, courtesy of Skullcandy. (Skullcandy branding is all over this game, making it feel like an advergame.) The few tracks included quickly got repetitive, leading me to turn it off entirely in favor of my own collection.\n\nMuch of Sideway feels off. Hitboxes seem to extend beyond their sprites. Jumping from a swing isn't based on momentum, instead giving a fixed vertical boost. Combat is simple button-mashing, and the game would be improved by its removal.\n\nSideway is a short game, and I doubt the promised sequel will ever exist.

It would've been better if they used the mechanics from Paper Mario Wii, so: 2D the whole time and 3D only when you have to switch around stuff. Other than that, the concept is fun and it works I guess. It IS enjoyable, despite my ranting.\nAnyway, don't get me started on the music, I hate the music, I really do, it's not my style. I have to disable the sound to even enjoy this game at all. Ok, ok, I'll stop criticizing now.\nAll in all it's a decent experience.\n\n[Rating: 68/100]","December 18, 2011","true","0.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Using the buildings themselves as the levels you traverse across the walls and roofs of the skyline itself collecting items, abilites, and fighting spray painted enemies along the way.\n\nThe level design is incredibly well thought out, because you platforming along the side of a building or roof, which generally have four sides to them, the perspective and orientation of the level is constantly being rotated and flipped as you slip around a corner and switching your axis. This makes the maps very dense and tight, you never get bored going through a level because you'll be attacking it from several directions in very quick succession.\n\nThe art direction is perhaps one of my favorite part of the game, a vibrant, bright world of Graffiti and spraypaint pops out from the muted, cool coloured canvas of the urban environment. The character design is eye catching and organic, with its fluid animations further complimented by the smoothness of the camera as it rotates around corners as it follows the character. Everything looks like a urbanised flash cartoon, or Adidas commercial.\n\nThe music in the game surprised me a lot. As some one who isn't in any skretch a fan of Hip Hop, I quickly came to love the rythyms and tones they set while I parkoured on the side of a high rise. The soundtrack, which was prepared by SkullCandy (headphone maker) and Hip Hop artist Mr. Lif, is unforunately reused a lot throughout the game, but they're good enough tunes for me too not mind too much. Though I wish the game developers would sell the soundtrack as a whole on itunes.\n\nSubway New York is a great game, an fine example of how a platformer should be made. But it has one GLARING, UNEXCUSABLE FLAW. It has got to be the sloppiest, half hearted console port I've ever seen. It becomes abundently clear this was first made for the Playstation 3 with its terrible default keyboard layout, its jump right in two player coop, its "do not turn off console" while saving messages, and sometimes refering to a controller instead of a keyboard. This game was made for a joystick and it shows, you'll struggle it make jumps and get inexplicibly killed in the environment, not to mention confuse your keys in the middle of a fight and suffer a cheap death, AGAIN!!\n\nIf you grew up playing Super Mario Bros you owe it too yourself to give Sideway a try!\n\nBut be sure to use a proper controller!!","December 11, 2011","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
