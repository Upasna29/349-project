I could write several pages about why this game is enjoyable to play, but there are a million reviews that can give you that.  Instead, let me explain why all of the negative reveiwers are wrong:\n\n1 - Most of the negative reviewers can't read.  I don't know how to put this politely, but it seems that 9/10 of the negative reviews I see about this game come down to the fact that the reviewer didn't understand how a certain card or area worked.  For example, they'll say things like, "I couldn't use my Psionic Blast card in the middle of combat????"" ... when the card clearly states when you can use it.  I'm sorry, but if you can't even read, you shouldn't be reviewing games.\n\n2 - Many of the negative reviewers are 'hung up' on the game's randomness; in their minds, this means that the game does not "require any skill".  Several reviews talk about the random nature of the dice rolls and card draws--you even have YouTube personalities getting uptight over the randomness--and they all try to make the same, idiotic argument:  that the game isnt' as "good" as, say, Dota 2, or League of Legends (where skill is required).  Of course, what they are trying to say is that, in their estimation,  the game lacks strategic depth.  This is, of course, entirely false.  While the game may be easy to play (not requiring much skill), Talisman has layers upon layers of strategic depth, in that the entire game is built around choice-based risk management and knowledge of the game.\n\nYou see, these YouTubers who have NO FAMILIARITY WHATSOEVER with the game--and thus no strategic understanding of what they should be doing--and are just throwing dice and drawing cards, at random, and then simply pronouncing the game "dumb", "dull", or "without merit"--they're all just talking out of their asses.  They're like chimpanzees poking at a keyboard, as they make one bad decision after another.  And because the game isn't, say, League of Legends, they simply pass it off as crap.  Meanwhile, they raise up games like Hearthstone, etc.,  even though they are equally abstract and are driven by a similar kind of randomness.\n\n3 - Talisman is difficult for many reviewers to even classify, much less actually review well, and for a very specific reason.  On the surface, the game is "abstract", much in the same way that other boardgames, like Monopoly, are abstract.  The game board is an abstract "construct" that you move around by random dice rolls.  At the same time, you are playing a discreet character, in an almost RPG fashion, with spells, abilities, statistics, inventory, followers, etc.  These two aspects of the game, when combined, seem to confuse many reviewers who are simply incapable of appreciating the game as a whole.  They tend to focus on one of the game's aspects, while ignoring the other (or getting confused by it), and then lay all kinds of criticisms without looking at the whole game.  These are reviewers who simply cannot "pair" the RPG aspect with the abstract, boardgame aspect, so they simply trash the game without a second thought.  I'm sorry, but if you're too stupid to understand a game's overall design, you shouldn't be allowed to review it.\n\nDon't even get me started on the negative reviewers/monkeys who can't figure out the UI.  I mean ... really?  The game can be played on an iPad, but you can't figure out how to use the UI?  If nothing else, that tells you what kind of reviewer you're dealing with.\n\n4 - The base game has its flaws, but with DLC, Talisman: Digital Edition is a really great game.  Some reviewers complain about the game's standard ending--and, I would have to admit, the standard ending, in its own way, is rather lacking, and it can certainly take a while for the game to conclude.  There are options to make the game end faster, but of course the negative reviewers again fail to mention (or even see) this.\n\nMore than anything, though, it's worth noting that, the game's ample amount of DLC provides a metric ton of content, from 20+ new characters to play, additional game boards/regions, NPC's, hundreds of new cards, items, etc.--as well as dozens of new endings, both revealed and unrevealed.  And more are coming, as Nomad works to "finish" and/or round out the rest of the game, so that it matches the full boardgame (with all expansions) developed by Fantasy Flight Games.\n\nTo judge Talisman WITHOUT the DLC--which EVERYONE knew was coming--is just a huge disservice to the game.  I understand that reviewers are tasked with reviewing the base game on its own merit, but really anyone who is familiar with the board game will tell you that to review the base game alone is just a waste of a review.  With DLC, Talisman: Digital Edition is a great, very enjoyable, game, and any reviwer who "trashed" the base game--knowing that it was basically "unfinished", in a sense--is just ignorant, in my opinion.  They could at least mention the fact that DLC changes the base game completely.  Of course, none of these negative reviewers ever come back to re-review the game, with all of the DLC.  Like every good tabloid "writer", they're simply happy to skewer an easy target, and just move on.  It's shameful, really.\n\nAnyway ....If you are a boardgame fan and are thinking about getting Talisman, and are "on the fence" because of all of the negative reviews:  Don't worrry.  Don't listen to them.  Just get the game.  And get the DLC as well.  It's well worth it.  The negative reviews are largely written by people who can't read, who only played the base game, and are so used to playing FPS games, MOBA's, etc., that they don't even know what to make of Talisman.  Their reviews are crap.","November 1, 2015","true","116.2"," 253 of 302 people (84%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","84","253","302","41","6"

We are resilient, we are focused, we keep on playing the objective instead of mindlessly hoarding items for the rest of our days. But Talisman isn't meant to be played against the AI.\n\nIt's an incredibly fun game if you have at least two friends to play with. Please buy this game so I can pretend I have friends. It has huge replay value, a wide variety of characters and game modes, and even more if you buy the DLC, which isn't necessary, but I've done it anyways, because who gives a damn, it's my money, bro, don't tell me what to do.\n\nIt's a lot like Game of Thrones, not in the sense that you can have sex with your siblings, but more like you can furtively ruin the game for other players out of nowhere, like it's Wedding day.

I'd heard about the digital edition quite a while ago, when it first entered the Steam greenlight process (originally as Prologue, the single player edition). I've followed the progress up to the point where it was released though Steam Early Access and then jumped at the chance to get it.\n\nI've had a real blast playing both the Digital Edition (just against AI opponents at the moment) and playing the Prologue (single player variant game). My wife also expressed interest in playing it again (either Board version or Digital edition) so we gave local multiplayer a try using Steam Big Picture on her laptop, hooked up to our TV, and passing a mouse between us. It was a lot of fun\n\nIf you've ever played the boardgame, then I highly recommend the digital version. The game is faithful to the original in virtually every respect, with the addition of the Prologue single player edition which makes for a very enjoyable single player experience. There's no online multiplayer in the early access version yet, but it is coming in time for the full release of the game.\n\nIf you've never played the boardgame, but are interested in fantasy themed adventure boardgames, then track down the Demo of Talisman Prologue (http://www.talisman-game.com/prologuedemo/) and give it a try.","November 26, 2013","true","125.8"," 98 of 112 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","98","112","0","0"

I have played extensively on This Digital Deluxe version of Talisman now and can render the following Analysis:\n\nKeeping in mind that it IS still in Pre-release stage overall it is an enjoyable gaming experience one can play with the whole family (Up to 4 players).\n\nPros:\n\n1.) Simple to learn and play\n2.) Ease of use - the game is entirely mouse driven. One can play with the keyboard sitting on the desk, feet kicked up ... using only the mouse as you relax in your favorite chair.\n3.) In-game voice chat which can be muted by individual player\n4.) Fantasy based ... always a plus :)\n5.) Family Friendly - as long as you are not overly religious (Devils, demons, angels, undead etc are contained within)\n6.) A Mandatory Random setting!!! The host can set the game to Classic mode where no perks (Runes) can be used and all class choices are random, this is an option missing from other games (DoTP needs this badly)\n\nCons:\n1.) Glitches up terribly in Multi-player if someone leaves the game normally locking it up. (SP w/Bots works fine)\n2.) Game glitches if you alt/tab out to do something else\n3.) Re-playability isn't that good. It takes a couple of games to see all the spells and Adventure cards but once you have run through them once or twice, things tend to get repetative. They definitely need a wider range of spells and adventure cards.\n4.) Class balance isn't that good. Some classes are very noticeably more powerful than other classes and have abilities that give much greater advantages over other players (Prophetess and assassin come to mind)\n5.) Using AI's in Multi-player runs the risk of hanging the game up. Bots usually get hung up in the City at the alchemist and they go into an infinite loop and the game cannot progress from there but as of 1-7-2014 using all humans in MP games hasn't botched up unless someone rages quits .... which is common if the game is not going their way.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game as I expect all these problems to be worked out before its final release version.","January 7, 2014","true","108.3"," 72 of 82 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","72","82","0","2"

So, you'll find that the majority of negative reviews are from people who don't like Talisman.  Well duh.  That's not to say all negative reviews are irrellevant.  You just can't trust the meta score for a title like this and people playing a game they already know they'll hate makes for some pretty biased reviews.  The Steam ratings and reviews are generally more reasonable, though you do still see this happening.\n\nSo, are you new to Talisman?  New to board games in general?  No problem, simple way to see if you might enjoy it.  Youtube.  Go watch gameplay of the actual board game and/or the digital version.  If you find yourself wanting to take one of the seats and play - then this game is for you.  If it looks boring and you lose interest fast (as many people do with board games) then look elsewhere.  Lastly, I'm sure there are outliers.  People who like the board game but hate the digital version.  But, again - that should become obvious to you as you watch it played.\n\nI think Nomad has done an excellent job translating the game.  And as someone who has moved half-way across the world from their board game friends, it's a great way to keep in touch and get my fix.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_award/recommended/247000/","blue_award","Blue Award","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_award/","803 products in account","Digital edition of classic fantasy RPG board game, Talisman. If you know the board game and like it, think no more, you need this.\n\n..what if you don't know Talisman? I still recommend it!\n\nHeed this, though: old school board games tend to have different sensibilities than modern digital games and it may be bit too random for your taste. If you can't stomach being on top of the world only for your game to be turned into ashes in your mouth because of no fault of your own or genius of your opponents, but rather pure chance of bad dice rolls... This may not be for you.\n\nThat being said, people tend to look overly superficially and claim the game requires no skill. It's not true. Knowing what you're doing is half the battle. Yes the base rules are relatively straightforward, but there are many intricate synergies between your character and what's happening on the board, and seizing opportunities for such synergies is crucial to survival. More experienced or intelligent players *will* have enormous advantage over others.\n\nBut yeah, the other half of the battle is pure random rolls and there's always a small chance your next card will be something like a basilisk that rolls a double and you just simply die there and then, on the spot, game over. Or if someone makes grim reaper pay you a visit and you roll 1, pay fate to reroll, and still roll 1... Amygdala deeply rustled and cortisol city, you can get enraged and it is not pretty.\n\nAnyway...\n\nIt is quite a boon that there exist multiplayer scene for this game. Maybe not 24/7, but in reasonable European or American hours, it's not that hard to find a game. If you love the board game but have nobody to play with, digital version comes to the rescue and helps you to relive all those painful childhood memories ;)\n\nAnd all you need is base game; if any of the players who join your game have expansions, the host can turn them on, which is very nice. If your connection drops, AI plays for you until you rejoin but yes, you can rejoin, which is nice, too (though AI is only as smart as it has been programmed to be, if you know what I mean - live players can easily outsmart it but also make some stupid mistakes)\n\nThe bad things? Very occasionally the game crashes unrecoverably for some reason (even if you rejoin it will crash again), but I guess it's no better than rolling a double on a basilisk or double 1s on grim reaper so I wouldn't worry too much about it and there's always hope it will be fixed.\n\nIf you're a salty person, the game is generally not for you, as mentioned earlier.\n\nUI sometimes is not intuitive e.g. you can be quite puzzled when and how to cast a spell like Weaken or Freeze, or get confused and reroll a die when you actually wanted to pick one of the two outcomes in some situations.. only experience can help you here and hopefully fellow players if you ask nicely\n\n\nSee you on the Crown of Command, adventurer","April 10, 2015","true","157.2"," 48 of 54 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","48","54","2","2"

My partner and I enjoy playing and we laugh hard at the antics which play out over the board, but there are still way too many things not working as intended, too many bugs, too many instances where the user interface doesn't do what you may want it to do.\n\nThey're charging a lot of money for content that isn't even created yet, and the stuff that is already there often does not work as advertised. I've had a lot of fun with this game, but as yet it still acts way too much like a beta version for Nomad to be charging full price.\n\nI can recommend this game only to hardcore fans of the genre like myself.

The appeal of this game as a digital copy of the board game is twofold:  The computer manages all the fidely cards and components (plus no clean up or set up), and this digital edition is WAY cheaper than than the physical game.  Playing games with AI can be great too if you have no friends.\n\nIf you have no idea what Talisman is but are intrested in this game, let me lay it out for you:  Talisman is a RPG in a box.  You pick one of a million characters with unique abilites and attributes and race against other characters to reach the 'crown of command', a game space that slowly kills all the other players.  If you kill everyone else, you win.  The thing about the crown is that its locked away in an inhosptable wasteland that your weak character will not be able to reach right away.  As a result, you gotta level up, fighting monsters, encountering events, and PVPing other players.  Awesome stuff.\n\nThis game is not without its faults though.  This game is extremely RNG based.  Everything is based on dice rolls.  There is strategy in the game, sure, but alot of the time so many random things you can't control are happpening that you kind of have to just roll with it.  This is essentially the heart and soul of the game, so if this is unappealing to you, this game might not be for you.  Now personally, normally I hate games that are overly based on luck, but Talisman is great because it never pigeon holes you into situations.  Every turn you have a choice on which direction to go, where on the board(s) to travel, who to interact with, etc and these choices give you an illusion of freedom and often a way to blame yourself for your bad luck.  Went into a cave and got ♥♥♥♥ed by a dragon at level one?  Should have gone to town, your opponent would have got the dragon instead.  Now, this game does have a 'fate' system that lets you reroll dice, giving you some control over your luck, but it can be hard sometimes to know when is best to reroll and sometimes you can just reroll bad rolls again(dice rolls are seeded at the begining of the game, so reloading doesnt work).\n\nThis game does a great job of always giving you something to do and work towards, and the various expansions give lots of variety and alternative scenarios.  If you get this game I highly recommend some of the expansions (get the season pass on sale to get all future expansions cheap), specifically the reaper and the corner boards.\n\nBefore rounding out this review I just want to provide a shout out to the company that made this digital adaption, nomad games.  Originally I thought this company was just porting this game from the ios and wouldn't care for the quality of the game post release.  How wrong I was.  Not only do they participate on the forums frequently and respond to posters, but they have even developed and distributed free content based on customer critisism.  This is very rare these days and exremely praiseworthy.\n\nObjectively Talisman isn't the greatest game ever made, but I seriously love this game regardless.  It may be luck heavy but the experience of travelling around the board, collecting loot and getting stronger before racing to the end against other players is great.  Laugh at your friends as the dice ♥♥♥♥ them, then cry out in amazement as they get the luckiest card draws, but most of all enjoy the ride and the emerging narrative that the game provides.","April 17","true","30.9"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

I would happily recommend this to anyone, regardless of whether one was a fan of the original tabletop Talisman.\n\nTalisman: Digital Edition has HUGE replay value, owing to the random nature and variety of card draws, and the large assortment of character classes available. Each class allows (and often requires) you to approach the game in a different way. You can also customize various game rules before starting up a new game, which adds to the variety and replayability.\n\nThe DLC is also strongly recommended. Each expansion adds a massive number of new enemies, events, items, classes, and additional rules.

Well iam sure that i have to point out that  9/10 of all my latest games shows bugs (some game breaking some minors ones).\n*MP (public games) is most of the time a place for leavers and quitters.\n*The ai is improved compared with the one years ago, but still not worth to buy this game for a single player. You only can cheat the game (you add runestones to the ai and give them a big advantage)\n*They changed there Season Pass conduct, and released one DLC (The Shaman) without giving it for free to the former buyers.\n* A constant dropping number of people playing online on Steam\n\nFinally i have to note that ca 400 of my hours where used for beta gaming,  and as a long time supported and as a former member of most of the groups and even the founder of the german group.

While it's vaguely interesting, it's massively dominated by luck rather than strategy, and plays at a snail's pace once you know what's going on.\n\nThe default Crown of Command victory mechanic harshly punishes any player trying to win, effectively removing them from the game and having them roll a die every turn to see if they get closer to winning. During this time, other players can interrupt the lead player or heal themselves, build up their strength, reset the lead player's advantage, and then walk in and win an hour later. Luckily there are houserules that deal with this (instantly winning or disabling healing when someone reaches the Crown).\n\nThey try to keep it interesting with the runes, which you earn by playing a lot. All the runes do is give you a minor, but unfair, advantage. Additionally, custom classes and cards which were easy to incorporate in physical editions are sold in relatively expensive DLC packs, leaving the core game feeling sparse.\n\nIt could be fun as a lighthearted game with friends every once in a while.","April 4, 2015","false","11.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

My Elf soon discovers that he has a nack for lifting, so he begins to Lift all across the land. He soon becomes the strongest Elf, to the point that Dragons immediately burn up and die by simply being in his presence. The Elf soon becomes known as Bicelf, master the bicep and all things body building. The Elf then notices that a stream of protein powder has appeared in a forest, aswell as a stream of life in a another forest. Enraptured by its beauty he rushes to the stream with great passion ,and proceeds to travel back and fourth between the streams, mixing them into the ultimate protein shake, and in the end drinking the all the streams had to offer. However, while the Elf was busy mixing his poretin shake, a Dwarf who came from a noble line, decends into a pit of dispair in the tavern as he drinks his life away. He soon contracts every STD in existance, and came across a ball, of which whispers to him of darkness. However, because of the sheer number of STD's he has become a STD himself and begins to poison the entire land, slowly draining the life from anything he touches as nothing can fix him, and when I say nothing I mean nothing no healer, no magican not even a angel could heal him. My Elf hearing of this taint on the land travels to meet it, but the STD riddled Dwarf eludes him at every turn. Unable to catch the Dwarf, the Dwarf proceeds to devour all who live. The Dwraf of whom chases after a ninja who, has lost all honor and decended into killing innocent animals in the forest. Even trying to turn his sword into gold, but failing and leaving himself with a half sword half clump of gold that no one will buy. My Elf continues to destroy dragons by simply looking at them, but cannot catch the Dwarf. Seeing no other option my Elf turns to the crown of power, deciding the only option is to purge the world of life, of which will include the STD riddled Dwarf or as the towns call him, the destoryer of worlds. My Elf begins his journey entering the center world, melting the sentinal with a simple flex of his pecks. Now, with his 2 mules, Unicorn, ring of power, crown of soloman, battle axe, Mecernary, Alchemist, Water canister, chestpiece and most importantly the Talisman, he begins his journey into the wasteland. Back in the outside world, the Dwarfs power grows, and he finally reaches and mugs the ninja. Stealing his chestpiece for himself, and trading his kills in for strength, and slowly growing in power. After a short journey my Elf reaches the doors to the desert and begins his journey, in its harsh and unforgiving environment. As he travels through he soon meets death himself, death of whom claims to be stronger than the Elf. Hearing this, my Elf declares that nothing is stronger and begins to fight death. The battle lasts for days, but eventually my Elf gains the upper hand, body slamming death into the ground, and crushing him between his biceps. Having beaten Death to death, our hero proceeds to the crown. But, along the journey he is confronted by a pack of wolves, which he incinerates, by simple showing his perfect and well toned pecks. Now, at the last leg of his journey, he stands before the crown taking a moment to savor the moment he purges the destroyer of worlds. After, savoring the moment he then grasps the crown, placing it atop his head, and the purge begins. The Dwarf however, who has grown much stronger, feels the purge as it begins to take affect and makes a dash to stop the Elf. However, as he comes upon the sentinal he is torn apart by the sentinal. The ninja having seen this, runs out and uses a magic spell he learnt to destroy all the items the Dwarf held. As the items are thrown into the infinite void, a faint whisper could be heard by the ninja, telling him of the power of the ball the Dwarf possessed. But, the ninja's mind though devoid of all honor still retains its strength, and the ball is left to the void. The Dwarf unable to reconsitute himself, due to the purge begins to slip into the void, pulling all his cancerous STD riddled flesh with it. The Elf whom still wears the crown, finishes the purge, destroying the ninja and all life on earth, and sealing off the void so that nothing, not even the Dwarf could return. The Elf however, being the only thing alive on the planet, uses his powerful muscles to create life and begins to repopulate the world. Writing down the events tha thave transpired, so that the future generations of this world could read of their history. However, the Elf could not stay for long as his muscles soon became so perfect that he can no longer reside with the likes of mortals, at the risk of incinerating them from its sheer perfection. Ascending to the relm of the gods instead, where he could become the god of lifting.\n\nGood game 10/10, would purge the world of life to stop a insideous STD riddled Dwarf again.","July 3, 2015","true","36.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","75","6","8","8","2"

Having played dice with Death, and won, I was quickly on my way to true dominance. The Crown, so near my grasp... was snatched away in an instant. The troll who had tried so long to surpass me, always failing, clearly made devilish deals with that prancing imbecile of a wizard. I was blindsided by a curse and I had to choose between the total loss of my considerable physical strength, or another roll of the dice. I rolled, and I was made a toad. For three long rounds. I could no longer carry my dazzling array of mystical arms and armor or my enchanted trinkets. My followers abandoned me, thinking likely I was simply a toad now and would remain that way. I was forced to enter the Werewolf Den, and there I was brutally beaten back to Death's Door. Then I was shoved back to the Crypts where, weak and confused, I was banished from the inner-realm back to that hell-hole of a city. Gathering myself, freed from the toady curse which had ailed me, I prepared to ascend the ladder of chaos and ambition once more. The damage however had been done; despite defeating the Sentinel in my weakened state and  battling my way back into the inner-realms, I was ultimately undone by the coniving treacheries of that damnable troll.

You fight monsters and gain stats along the way(Just like Monopoly, THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO BUY THE PROPERTY- a.k.a fight the monster). This was one of the worst boardgames I've played, as it is linear, without any tactical sense or strategy required, and being 95% luck based clearly does not help.\n\nThis is coming from a huge boardgame fan - having played quite a huge number of them (Descent, Arkham Horror, War of the Ring, Cosmic Encounter- to name a few).\n\nMy Gameplay Session - Played a warrior, not knowing the rules, rolls some dice. Rolls more dice, arrives at the center early because it seems to be the goal- doesn't have to spend a brainwave to think. Realized that I can't get to the middle without an item, attacked an AI and got the Talisman. Arrived middle, then a 30 minute snooze-fest of rolling dice while the enemies heal up and die so very very slowly.\n\nI'm not saying that a good game needs to have some degree of complexity. I've enjoyed simple games like Ticket to Ride or Cleopatra, that at least its not a boring snooze fest. There is no immersion, I don't feel like a warrior, its just a label and gimmick, at the end of the days, Classes are just player modification that does very little to differentiate you from one another- you don't have to be smart about it, you just need to have half a brain and huge amounts of luck to do well in this game.\n\nI don't understand why this game has the "Strategy" or the "RPG" tag with it. It should instead be replaced with the "Casual" Tag. This game reminds me with many of the App games and certainly does not belong in these categories.\n\n3/10\n\n","July 22, 2014","false","6.4"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","1"

To win the game your character must stand at the Crown of Command where you get a chance to roll a dice, if you get 4, 5 or 6 every other player losses 1 life. I've just been stuck in a game for hours upon hours while a character with 8 life and a runeblade (Lets him heal 1 life whenever he kills something) stumbled around the board killing hoards of wolves, bears, bandits and anything else that he came across.

It is good that you have the option to only allow core characters, but I would like if there would be an option to disallow certain characters like the Martyr, Black Witch etc.\n\n-I would like a workshop, so people could make custom boards, cards, characters etc. Even tough there is alot of content released, I would enjoy for example a mod where you can replace the art with the original oldschol art.\n\n-Even tough the game is a skill based game, there is alot of luck involved. At times it feels like you are playing the odds at poker. I like it but some might not.\n\nAt the end tough this is a solid boardgame adaptions, with some flaws, but its fun overall.

I have played a lot of Talisman and it already isn't a game I'm very fond of. Almost the entire game is luck. What you roll to move, what cards you draw, whether you complete combat, it's all a coin flip. The main test of skill is knowing when you've acquired enough random loot to try the inner layers of the board. It's a very light game mechanically. It's rare that other players' turns have effects on you, so there's a lot of downtime. It's a social game.\n\nThe port is kind of a mess. Not only is the interface generally clunky requiring what feel like unnecessary taps to get to the information you want, but it's ported from the mobile version and clearly optimized for a touch screen, not a computer. For example, all of the controls are on the left and right edges of the screen where your thumbs would be on a tablet. It's a clunky version of an okay, very random board game.","December 24, 2014","false","1.3"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","21","39","0","1"

This game mimics the classic board game well but it\'s a vastly different experience when you play with a physical board, miniatures and a jolly group of friends in front of you. With the digital game, it just feels hollow without the expressions and emotions involved when a plan comes together or falls apart.\n\nThe game itself is quite easy to pick up but expect to spend at least 2 hours per playthrough depending on how many players in a match. There\'s a lot of downtime as to be expected with most board games while waiting for your turn to roll around and the mechanics are pretty rudimentary and very RNG dependent. Imagine your delight as you reach the very anticlimatic finale which is the Crown of Command. While there, expect to spend the remainder of your turns and probably 45 mins of your life just constantly failing a 50-50 chance a zillion times just to ATTEMPT to end the game while other players counterspell you, heal back up or just try to reach you.\n\nAside from destroying my mouse on multiple clicks to try to speed things up in frustration, the worst came when another player finally reached the Crown too then promptly died and left all his junk on the same tile which prompts an encounter at the start of each turn asking if you\'d like to pick up their stuff even when your own inventory is full thus adding more time to the excruciating endeavour.\n\nIf you must play the game, then I whole heartedly suggest playing the physical tabletop version with some good friends instead of the digital one.","June 1","false","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I was left with playing blind and ended up just walking away, since the computer controlled characters decided they all wanted to bash on me, so I kept loosing turn after turn, effectively turning the "game" into a slideshow.\n\nI trust the game will work out to be a lot more fun if you already know what it's all about, but I have no way to tell. My recommendation is therefor this: If you don't know the game, stay away from it. I just doesn't work as a stand-alone product.","April 5, 2015","false","0.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You can play the game whenever you want with a decent AI that does make weird mistakes or unnecessary decisions at times, or you can play online with strangers or friends. The UI does take a bit of getting used to, but it's pretty intuitive. There are bugs, but the team accepts feedback through the discussions page and they're fairly diligent in working them out.\n\nI actually reccomend getting the season pass with this, by the way. It comes with all the expansions and DLC characters (except the charity Shaman).\n\nI have a lot of fun achievement hunting in this game too (I am a proud owner of the Immortal achievement), although admittedly some of the achievements are really specific and weird.","November 24, 2015","true","166.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I’ve played a lot of board games where I start out with a big group of friends and a lot of excitement to play. Four hours later, I wonder – will this game ever end? Talisman: Digital Edition is a very faithful port of the classic board game and allows you to play either online with friends or against AI opponents.\n\nI’ve played a lot of this since I bought it, partially because it doesn’t require that much attention. It’s turn-based so I can play while watching an episode of some tv show, or I can tab out to do other things. I really like when board games are digitized. Not having to keep track of a tabletop full of life tokens and counters and spells, or put them away at the end, is a big plus for me.\n\nIf you like the Talisman boardgame, you’ll probably like this.

It's just fun (at least for a while).\n\nUnfortunately, there are some issues with this "digital version". It's glitchy and you have to fight the user interface more often than not: managing to cast spells at the right time so that they'll do what they are supposed to requires trial and error. Also the AI mostly runs around randomly looking for ways to commit suicide.\n\nOverall I give it a very cautious recommendation.

It isn't the most deep and well designed board game, it's a bit too based on luck and while it's easy and can take more time to learn than most modern euro board games. That said, Talisman is a fun game to play with friends and socialize. This adaptation in particular is really good and faithful to the original, with a lot of controls to create and enforce house rules, and there are many expansions packs for you to pick and them to release.

Let me explain why, the game itself is fun and good. It is more monopoly and chance related than your choices but it is fun to play with four people. It is the board game, so if you enjoyed the board game it you'll enjoy this. Only buy it on sale though, because... the board game is around $40 and you can just split that four ways with friends if you want.\nNow to the negative.\nMy problem is the game needs to be fixed. The spell casting is wonky, two DIFFERENT people with me accidently casted Immobilize on themselves because there is no Confirmation in some instances. When you play you'll get it, it is quite difficult to explain. There is also no Cancel button to take back and attacks or spells you use. This to me, is part of the fun with the game to scare/intimidate your opponent. Also, sometimes people misclick!\n\nAlright so I'll try to explain the spell casting. I have a spell called Psychic blast and it adds my craft to my strength for the fight. Except you for some reason can't activate it during combat? Unless it was qued up before? When it's qued any thing that triggers a fight will cast it, and sometimes you don't remember that it was qued and it goes off on something you didn't want. This is the same issue with Coutner Spell which is extremely frustrating.

Кидай собі кубик, совай фішки і гати бізнес/опонентів. Тема більш серйозних настолок в пост радянському просторі розкрита слабо.\nПо-перше, це дуже специфічна забава: деякі настольні ігри (особливо за редакцією правил D&D) настільки складні, що для розуміння найбанальніших аспектів потрібно витратити чимало часу на ознайомлення з правилами.\nПо-друге, коло фанів та гравців хоч і розширюється, проте недостатньо швидко: знайти компанію для гри в реалі доволі тяжко. Проте розробники Talisman - комп'ютерного аналогу одноіменної фентезійної настольної гри від Games Workshop взяли курс на широкі маси.\n\nТа незручна мить, коли параметр "Удача" прокачаний на 1Суть гри на перший погляд виглядає доволі тривіально: ось тобі карта, ось тобі персонаж. Мета: "всіх гепну і буду царювати". Тут варто зробити уточнення, що сценаріїв є достобіса, але всі вони доступні лише в додатковому контенті... Проте відривати кревно зароблені гроші не обов'язково: стандартна карта доволі реіграбельна - велика кількість унікальних персонажів, що доступні зі старту, дозволить розбавити ігровий процес.\nРухаємось ми по карті кидаючи ігрові кості ("дайси"). Якщо результат нам не дуже підходить, використавши один бал долі можна перекинути дайс. Також ця особливість стосується і певних локацій на карті (відьма, чаклун, цвинтар тощо). Особливо недитячий накал пристрастей і бурління емоцій викликають моменти, коли, в надії перекинути на що-небудь, окрім того що було, гравець отримує те саме значення на дайсі. 99% ragequit'ів і пригорілих штанів припадають на ситуації, коли вдруге випадає єдина нейприйнятна подія з шести можливих.\nПересунувшись на певне поле, ми тягнемо карту з колоди подій. Події можуть бути різними: від дракона до того самого Талісману, який дозволить нам пройти до фінального рівня карти і, подолавши усі перешкоди, почати робити масовий абзац менш везучим опонентам.\nВ процесі екстермінатусу ворогів нам допомогатимуть шмотки, супутники і навіть нейтрали (заваливши певну кількість істот можна прокачати магічну або фізичну силу персонажу). Проте, хоча багато чого і залежить від удачі і випадковості, не варто сліпо на неї покладатись, адже карти з закляттями і купа різного спорядження існує не просто так. Мудрі рішення - запорука перемоги.\n\nДля тих, хто любить очима Графомани можуть йти лісом, дивитись тут немає на що. Все гарно промальовано, але не більше. 2D інтерфейс доволі зрозумілий: якщо на карті стоять хрести, то це кладовище, якщо стоїть храм... Ну, ви зрозуміли.\n\nЛожка дьогтю в банці медуПохила навчання доволі крута. Перші 2-3 гри ви будете вигрібати механіку і задавати питання "Що я? Хто я? Чому я?!".\nДругий біль - відсутність локалізації: якщо ваша англійська складається лише із "My name is Vova" - бути біді. Тексту багато, читати його треба, інакше вашому протеже настане каюк.\nІнший мінус - наявність у онлайн іграх тролів або людей, які через тільки Богу відомі причини стають AFK: чекання по півтори хвилини на хід гравця (яких може бути до 4х) вибішує жвавіше, аніж виступи наших депутатів. Трохи покращує ситуацію автозаміна хронічних слоупоків ботами і можливість продовжити гру пізніше.\n\n- Зараз буде шістка!\n- Ага, кидай вже.\n- Нуууууууууу....! [censored]!!!!!!Гарний тайтл, якщо є компанія друзів (зі знанням англійської) з якими можна забацати конфу в скайпі і розібратись, хто найвезучіший покидьок на селі. Трошки осторонь стоїть гра з незнайомими гравцями по Інтернету. Отже якщо ви запросто зриваєте джекпоти в казино або хочете долучитись до серйозних "настолок" і ваш інгліш включає не тільки сакральне "F*ck you!" - ласкаво просимо","July 8, 2015","true","9.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","8","14","4","1"

Talisman: Digital Edition brings to the plate the concept of sitting down with three friends and experiencing the thrill of telling a character’s story through each roll of the die.  Though Talisman does bring a lot to the plate in terms of accessibility and content, frustrating mechanics and game-breaking bugs riddle what could be an above-average title.\n\nTalisman pits a chosen character against three players, human or A.I., in a quest to retrieve the Crown of Command.  To do so, one must obtain the coveted Talisman to cross the Valley of Fire.  Getting to the Valley of Fire is no simple feat, as one has to train their characters to withstand the demons, monsters, spirits, and other characters out to end their journey.  Each character comes with five stats: Strength, Craft, Lives, Fate, and Gold.  Strength determines how much damage you can do against strength monsters.  Craft shows how much damage you can deal to craft-based monsters, as well as your stat to how many magic spells you can hold.  Lives are your total life counter, when you hit zero, you drop all your items and go back to base stats.  Fate is your re-roll counter, use a Fate counter to re-roll for a better number.  Gold allows you to buy certain items from vendors, as well as bargain with certain monsters.\n\nThe goal in Talisman is to beef up a character, retrieve a Talisman through either completing a quest or through prayer, and reaching the Crown of Command.  Doing so is no easy or short task, with most games taking easily over an hour to complete, depending on dice rolls and which cards appear.  Though the allotted time spent on one game may put off players, getting three friends in the mix most certainly makes the time much more enjoyable.  The accomplishment of getting a character to ludicrous levels and auto-killing dragons makes the long journey well worth it, especially when a character can auto-kill a friend’s character; the fear one can put onto people is wicked fun.\n\nBut where Talisman shines with its cooperative play, there are many design decisions that can frequently darken the experience, mainly how luck-based Talisman proves to be.  Almost every move one does in Talisman is based off the luck of the die: movement, combat, everything on the path to victory relies on something completely out of control.  Items and objects can help the strain of progressing through the map, but there are spots on the board where one unfortunate roll can wipe away almost an hour’s worth of progress.  It’s almost as if Talisman does not want the player to win, opting more to continue progressing characters to no discernable end, something a game should never do.\n\nThe most disappointing factor in Talisman is its abundance of game-breaking bugs and issues that plague aspects of the game.  Through the 11 hours I played, at least once every two games would freeze or lock into a game-breaking screen.  Whether it was being stuck in an item screen, the “roll dice” button refusing to work, or being stuck perpetually casting a spell, it’s a hard pill to swallow letting a game go one to two hours only to have to exit the game with no accomplishment or satisfaction for the time spent.\n\nTalisman also has one unbelievably laughable issue with its Warlock Quests; Warlock Quests are specific quests, like visiting an NPC on the board, or acquiring armor, that fulfilling the quest will grant you a Talisman and get you on the path to victory.  If a player happens to acquire a Talisman and not finish their Warlock Quest, the path to get to the final section of the board will be blocked off until the quest is complete, regardless of if the character already has the prize at hand.  What’s even more baffling is there’s no way to remove a Warlock Quest unless the character dies completely, this is almost game breaking when a Warlock Quest like “Slay a Dragon” is in possession, leaving one to hope that they can find one to two specific cards in a 100+ card deck amongst three other players.  Situations like this become more common than they should be, and it’s a really sad ordeal to see a game come to an abrupt end after one can get so enveloped into their game.\n\nTalisman has every right to be a popular, fun, and engaging game to experience with friends and players online.  Each character plays a different role and each game plays out different than the last.  It’s just a shame to see such a bright experience be crippled by frequent crashes, freezes, bugs, and some laughable design choices that do nothing but encumber the experience.

Timing of spells is the biggest one offhand.  You often need to play a spell at the start of the affected character's turn but, at least when playing against the computer there is often no delay between after one character has moved (signifying the end of the start of it's turn) and the turn ending meaning.  The queue system is very clunky and it is very easy to cast a spell/use an item too early, too late, or even at the completely wrong time due to it being playable at the wrong place in combat.\n\nAlso you cannot look at the board outside of your turn causing you to waste time doing it on your own turn if you missed something.  In singleplayer you can look at the board outside of your turn but it pauses the game.  There is no sort of event log or even way to view the discard piles (that I am aware of) so often things will flip by and you'll have no idea what transpired and no way to look.  As mentioned in the comments there is an event log and it seems to have some good options for filtering.\n\nIn multiplayer there are often problems where one or more person will be disconnected and you get to rewatch the computer play the same turn(s) over.  This seems to happen more often later in the game and w/ the city expansion but that's just my experience from 2-3 games.  Frequent crashes and glitches can cause players to miss the end of game meaning they get no in game credit or achievements for anything they would have earned there for potentially several hours of effort.\n\nThere was a recent patch addressing many outstanding issues with the game.  End of game crashes most notably were addressed and I haven't seen that happen in the few games I've played since.  I haven't seen any midgame crashes either, but I have not tried playing with the city expansion again.\n\nOne upside is the Season Pass actually comes with all the dlc with the exception of one which contributes to charity.\n\nIf most of these problems were addressed I would absolutely recommend this game especially to fans of the physical game.","January 13","false","25.8"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","19","36","0","2"

If you think of this as an adaptation that's easier to play with [due to no setup, no space needs, and you can give copies of the game to your friends] then this game... well, is amazing!\n\nThere's a lot to take in, at first. Empty board spaces means random encounters, means fights with monsters or loot, or spaces that permanently will help or hinder whoever next lands there. You have many characters with special abilities to choose from-- or set everyone to random characters!\n\nThe goal of course, is get a Talisman card while improving your character's stats through encounters and finding items. Best challenges like crossing a river, going through a portal, fighting demons, rolling dice with Death Itself... there is just so much inside this board game! Many paths to take, different ways to beat challenges.... You must survive the trials, and the other players- to make your way to the center crown... To hopefully kill the other players until you are the last man standing.\n\nThat last part is essentially a 50/50 chance each turn, but there's an option to house rule it to make it finish easier-- such as making players unable to heal if someone is in the center, or just straight up make it a race to the finish.\n\nDid I mention that there's not a huge penalty with dying? Apart from other characters stealing your stuff- if you have a rough time you can totally respawn and bounce back--- unless of course, it's the endgame, and someone controls the Crown at the center of the board.\n\nIn short, although there's no take-back option if you select the wrong spot to go to--- or Queue the wrong spell and say, accidentally alchemize your Talisman card as soon as you get it--- This game is phenomenal once you understand what's going on, what strategies you can use.... and definently playing more than the Warrior will lead you to realize there' a lot going on in this board game adaptation!\n\nYou can quit single vs Ai games any time and return to them later. Doesn't work in multiplayer--- and the one big constraint is time. This game is amazing-- but you do need a free evening, my first match literally took 90 minutes. But TtheWriter mentioned the physical game did that too, so I was somewhat prepared--- most steam games I believe aren't this massive.\nI'm the sort of gamer who absolutely adores replay value. I've got 188 hours in The Binding of Isaac, and I can't even record a Let's Play of that. This though- Talisman can be recorded if you set Fraps to record the Aero desktop and then set'er in fullscreen.\n\nAnyway, this game is amazing if you have the patience to figure it out, and the background of a D&D enthusiast to appreciate the combat system and lengthy quest.","July 1, 2014","true","191.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Lots of fun, the additional playable characters and the expansions really add to the experience as well.  The UI is simple and intuitive, and I have yet to run into a card that is bugged.  The AI is a bit stupid, and will very rarely make a play for the crown.  There is no difficulty slider to make them better.\n\nHowever, if you buy this you should realize you are buying it baiscally for vs. AI play or hotseat play at home.  The online servers are absolutely rubbish.  95% of the time online games will crash at launch.  On the rare 5% occasion an online game actually starts, it will crash or lag out in the first couple turns (if not during character selection!) 95% of /those/ times.\n\nShould you actually manage to get off the ground with an online game, odds are good that something unfortunate will happen to someone and that person will ragequit, which invariably crashes the game as well.\n\nI say, without exaggerating, that I have actually managed to complete 3 online games out of about 200 attempted.  It baffles me that the game can be so very good and the online technical bits can be so unbearably useless.\n\nConclusion - If you are a longtime talisman fan, and you have real-life friends to play with, hook this up to your tele and get a wireless mouse to pass for a fun evening.  Or, if you don't mind playing against AIs slightly less intelligent than your average cocker spaniel, pick this up.

What made  the game fun was playing with other people face to face so that Diplomacy-like dynamics gave the game another level.  Thus  It became a "beer-and-pretzels" game for kicking back at the end of a long day of serious gaming.  It helped to be heavily medicated.  It was fun and relatively mindless.\n\nThat is missing in single-player and even multiplayer when not face to face.  However it would be a fun game for lightweight gamers and young gamers and I can recommend it for that.\n\nThree games in, single-player, I wish I had not bought the game.  I could have bought a number of games I would have enjoyed more with the $15.  If it had been available at GOG.com I would have bought it there with their 30 day guarantee and would be returning it tonight, the same day I bought it.   I would readily give it up for $10.  Now, after I try it online multiplayer,  it will likely go in a special folder for  mindless day games when I am sick and medicated and bored with HULU but unable to function in a game that requires too much thinking.\n\nThat said, it was well done, attractive with a good interface and plays faster than the boardgame version.  Not for me but definitely a good game for some.  Hard core gamers will probably be disappointed.   The die rolls bring too much luck into the game and not much skill...but Monopoly (which I got bored with at 8 yrs old) has been wildly successful for almost a century.  This could be a good family gaming night entry.\n\nOne final comment.  After an online multiplayer game starts, there appears to be no way to communicate with others in the game to, for example, agree to stop until "tomorrow at 1pm". So it will probably be necessary to use a voice chat and wear headphones.  Otherwise people will be unable to warn you that they are dropping out or lost their connection.  Sorry, Corpse.\n\n__________________\nAfter playing a bit longer.  Interface not as good as origionally thought.  It is easy to accidentally lose cards because of similar moves in different parts of the game.  It can be very ambiguous at times.\n\nFurther, at Level 8 character, I am trapped in a loop that lookis like the AI will repeat forever while I am trapped in the center Casting Command Spell repeatedly and unable to leave.  Since the AI has a poltergeist it repeats it's move over and over...because each time it IS the best move for the AI.  After playing up 8 levels with my troll I have no way out without starting a new game and losing all progress.  Now I really do not want to waste my time playing TALISMAN unless they remove this bug.  There are places in the game that will just hang you up in a loop with no escape.  I remove my recommendation from when I first played TALIZMAN DIGITAL","June 17, 2014","false","126.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I purchased the season pass for this in order to get all of the expansions as they become available. While I certainly get a bit itchy to see the next one come up immediately, it is not because of undue slowness of release so much as my enthusiasm. That being said, do not expect to pick this thing up and have all content immediately, or even in the next couple of months. I feel that the quality of the experience definitely is worth the wait, but if you are an "instant gratification only" sort of gamer, then I would advise waiting a little bit. I say this because the value of the season pass is incredible. Since this is a bit of a financial leap, I downloaded the demo of the Prologue, liked what I saw, and went for it. A comparison of the cost between the tabletop version of the game + expansions will send you reeling, and to me was a great option as a way to eventually test the expansions out before investing in the physical boards, since I don't play often enough to justify buying all of them.\nTotally worth it, in my opinion!!!\n\nThe Game:\nThe game varies in small ways from the Prologue, as it has been updated and refined, and I consider these differences to be in the best interest of the game for playability and ease of use. Keep in mind that the prologue is designed as a single player experience, and the interface is adjusted accordingly.\nUnfortunately, I have not been online with the game and can therefore not comment on that.\nThe House Rules and various play options are fantastic.\nThe DLC: In between releases of expansions, features are updated and new characters are added to the mix. These have interesting abilities and seem balanced, though I am still playing through to try different play styles, since some characters are meant to flourish when played in a particular way.\nI was really pleased with the way that the Reaper expansion was handled. There are some great adventure cards and characters, but the Reaper himself is not my favorite game element. When the community spoke, the developers listened and added the ability to deactivate the Reaper while keeping the rest of the expansion in play.\nFrostmarch has just been released, so I look forward to checking that out as well.\nI expect that some members of the community may say that this content "should" be released faster, I really think that the quality is well worth the wait, and that the characters that are added in between expansions keep the worst of the suspense at bay.\n\n","June 24, 2014","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you think of this as an adaptation that's easier to play with [due to no setup, no space needs, and you can give copies of the game to your friends] then this game... well, is amazing!\n\nThere's a lot to take in, at first. Empty board spaces means random encounters, means fights with monsters or loot, or spaces that permanently will help or hinder whoever next lands there. You have many characters with special abilities to choose from-- or set everyone to random characters!\n\nThe goal of course, is get a Talisman card while improving your character's stats through encounters and finding items. Best challenges like crossing a river, going through a portal, fighting demons, rolling dice with Death Itself... there is just so much inside this board game! Many paths to take, different ways to beat challenges.... You must survive the trials, and the other players- to make your way to the center crown... To hopefully kill the other players until you are the last man standing.\n\nThat last part is essentially a 50/50 chance each turn, but there's an option to house rule it to make it finish easier-- such as making players unable to heal if someone is in the center, or just straight up make it a race to the finish.\n\nDid I mention that there's not a huge penalty with dying? Apart from other characters stealing your stuff- if you have a rough time you can totally respawn and bounce back--- unless of course, it's the endgame, and someone controls the Crown at the center of the board.\n\nIn short, although there's no take-back option if you select the wrong spot to go to--- or Queue the wrong spell and say, accidentally alchemize your Talisman card as soon as you get it--- This game is phenomenal once you understand what's going on, what strategies you can use.... and definently playing more than the Warrior will lead you to realize there' a lot going on in this board game adaptation!\n\nYou can quit single vs Ai games any time and return to them later. Doesn't work in multiplayer--- and the one big constraint is time. This game is amazing-- but you do need a free evening, my first match literally took 90 minutes. But TtheWriter mentioned the physical game did that too, so I was somewhat prepared--- most steam games I believe aren't this massive.\nI'm the sort of gamer who absolutely adores replay value. I've got 188 hours in The Binding of Isaac, and I can't even record a Let's Play of that. This though- Talisman can be recorded if you set Fraps to record the Aero desktop and then set'er in fullscreen.\n\nAnyway, this game is amazing if you have the patience to figure it out, and the background of a D&D enthusiast to appreciate the combat system and lengthy quest.","July 1, 2014","true","191.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But this game is still fantastic, and the expansions and huge number of characters and special abilities make up for it. Especially if you get all the expansions. (There is the reaper expansion which adds 4 characters, various spells, and enemies, new events, and places, and all new treasures, The Runestone expansion deck, which is a deck of cards used to power up your characters quickly, and apparently can be carried over from game to game, and 5 new character packs, that juat add new characters in the game, such as the Genie, etc.) and the ability to make houserules, as well as possibly choose  the character you play, all adds new quirks to the game as well as the much feared Reaper, who at the whim of a player could out right kill you, with a bad roll of the die. The quest for the crown of control has never been more wrought with danger, and intrigue. If you are a fan of the classic board game, or a fan of the adventure board game in general you'll want it all, and the prologue version of this too. Oh and this version, has steam achievements. (Unlike Prologue)\n\nOverall Numbers:\n\nGraphics: The game board looks good, and the cards and characters look spectacular, a definate step up from the prologue edition of this game. 10/10\n\nControls: Easy Peasy , fast and responsive, easy to master. 10/10\n\nAchievements: This game has got them, and they are fun to get too. No score for this but well worth mentioning if you like that stuff.\n\nFun Factor: Get the whole package and it is awesome, you'll love this game, it's not perfect, but it is really good. 8/10\n\nNotes:\n\nUse the Zoom In button on the side of the screen to look and see who is at what space, as well as what card is on that space.\n\nMake sure to become friends with who you play with, you never know when you might get an extended game and need to save.\n\n","May 26, 2014","true","67.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Progress to a certain point, only to be knocked all the way back. I won't go into too many details so as to not ruin anyone's first playthrough, but the game unnecessarily takes longer than it should.\n\n2: Buggy! We encountered the following bugs in the original & frostmarch expansion:\n\nBug 1: Player is unable to finish their turn because they can't perform an action, i.e. discarding a card.\n\nBug 2: If you quit the game (such as to clear out the error in Bug 1) and then rehost, the AI encounters a bug where it will not perform its turn until the timer completely winds down. The only way to prevent this from completely ruining your game is setting the timeout for each player's turn at 30 seconds, then at least you only wait 30 seconds.\n\nBug 3: Finishing quests. There are some items that are INCREDIBLY picky as to the order you complete them, so much so that it won't always be apparent. i.e. if you pick up the false grail, you are required to visit the Castle to discard it. However, you can only discard it during a certain action while visiting the castle. It's easier to see in action than it is to explain, but let's chalk up to poor game mechanics.\n\n3: Sometimes awfully boring, depending on what class you pick. A lot of these classes (i.e. the ones that don't draw spells) are highly dependent on landing on tiles that have associated actions that they can complete. Unfortunately, this isn't always the case. This game seems to highly favor the spellcasters, because the spells allow you to overcome or encounter things that being a melee-focused character would not. This is unfortunate.\n\nOverall, would not recommend. Played through it twice, and we all found each session very obnoxious at a certain point. It was always one of the three items above, though.","July 5, 2014","false","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had the boardgame version of Talisman and several of its expansions years ago, and played it a lot. The biggest problem I've encountered with this version is the usability. Spell casting, for example, is kind of dreadful. Several times I have tried to cast spells--even after learning the system of queueing spells--and had them not cast; I have accidentally cast spells when I simply wanted to read the text to see what they do, wasting them; and I have tried casting spells at the times that are indicated in the text, only to find out, nope, that was not the right time to cast it.\n\nImportant information text from the game is ill placed at the top of the screen in a box that is not prominent and doesn't stand out.\n\nThere are an awful lot of confirmation clicks as well--too many in some cases. Also, sometimes the confirmation text is not the best. For example, when you're learning the game and you view your followers, the "Dismiss" option can leave you wondering, Wait, will that dismiss my follower? Dismiss is a term in gaming that, in my experience, has always been used to get rid of followers. A better term for getting rid of message windows is simply "Close."\n\nI hope there are improvements to the game design.

The visuals are functional but do not give you a sense of satisfaction. The movement feels awkward and clunky and you can never seem to get a view of the board that you really want.\n\nLike the original game it ends up being a lot more luck and very little strategy. It falls into the same trap or you can eventually just almost start a game over completely from scratch just due to bad rolls or you will have 10 to 15 turns where nothing actually happens.\n\nThis was a missed opportunity to update the game modernize it and make it more fun such as adding simple mechanics that could have sped up gameplay.

The visuals are functional but do not give you a sense of satisfaction. The movement feels awkward and clunky and you can never seem to get a view of the board that you really want.\n\nLike the original game it ends up being a lot more luck and very little strategy. It falls into the same trap or you can eventually just almost start a game over completely from scratch just due to bad rolls or you will have 10 to 15 turns where nothing actually happens.\n\nThis was a missed opportunity to update the game modernize it and make it more fun such as adding simple mechanics that could have sped up gameplay. Instead you are treated to a game does exactly the same as it was 40 years ago, and even then there was criticism that it simply dragged on too long.

It is a fair question: It is a very enjoyable board game, and a faithful recreation of the original source material. The gameplay is everything you would expect: Easy to pick up and play, harder to master, and the randomness of the card draws, the dice rolls and the shape of the board presence after about 50 turns in (and you will be playing more than this locally) means that no two games are ever the same in any playthrough, and victory is never certain: A risk-taking AI or one that gets better luck with their dice rolls could always be one step ahead of you, but there's always some way or another for the AI to be betrayed or lose their advantage, given the numerous random events that can transpire in the course of a game.\n\nWhy can I not recommend this game? Most who've played the board game or those who know how board games work in general know that it's better to play with friends. Unless you're willing to pass a laptop around - or play hot potato with the seat where your desktop is hiding out - the ability to play with friends since the 25th or so has nosedived. A quick look at the bug reporting section of the forums gives all the confirmation you may need: The change to the back-end of their online component has a lot of issues following a shift from a Steam-dependent component. I don't know why this change wasn't tested out before releasing it to the public (assuming that development costs aren't an issue) but it doesn't change the current state of the online component right now: A broken, unstable mess.\n\nHaving played several games online with the friends I also bought the game for, I got to experience some of these issues first-hand: Gameplay freezes after casting certain spells, the AI refuses to move in a timely manner in online games, starting up online games can sometimes be problematic to the point that you have to recreate the room (I always made mine private, but I would imagine this issue becomes worse for public rooms) and I've even experienced a crash in the 15-ish hours I've played this game online - or at least attempted to without any of these problems arising. Out of seven games, I only managed to have two completed: One was a two-player game, another a three-player that the other two players were forced to drop out of because they ended up having issues.\n\nSo to reiterate: In it's current state, this game is not completable online, in some cases it might not even be playable online. If you just want to play with your friends around the party table on a laptop or want to kill some time by yourself playing against some AI's, then this is a faithful recreation of the board game that you will get plenty of hours of enjoyment from (and given how the other 15 hours have been single-player and without any issues at all, I have no doubt of this). If you are, however, looking to play with friends over an online connection or have any desire to use the online component at all, then I have to recommend that you hold off until the issue is resolved with it's online component, as it is not in any fit state to be worth your time or your money.","December 28, 2014","false","49.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It mostly consists of a lot of random dice rolls, lots of redundant clicking, and obfuscated information.\n\nThe overall gameplay feels like being on the cusp of winning a game of trivial pursuit, but you can't role the exact dice roll needed to land in the center of board. Or perhaps like a game of Chutes & Ladders where you never know whether you're going to go up or down.\n\nThe physical board game is probably much more fun. This game is probably also more fun if you're playing with some friends.\n\nThe game is a "traditional American" board game, where most of the gameplay is determined by random events, with very little choice left up to the player for how the game progresses. Random events can completely make or break the game for you.\n\nThere is some player interaction in the way of being able to cast counter spells during another player's turn, but the UI and digital game mechanics here are a bit wonky.

If you like the random dice role and random card drawing type of game, and are willing to tolerate the cumbersome UI, then you might want to give it a go, but I still don't recommend paying more than a couple dollars for it.","December 30, 2014","false","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is fun, online or offline (but still better with friends).  If you like the board game, you'll probably like this version, as they did a good job getting the basic Talisman experience in here.  The UI can feel kind of awkward sometimes because of weird button placement and the need to click more times than necessary to do certain tasks, but it's possible to get used to and then it stops detracting from the game at all.  The game also has some advantages over the original such as not having to shuffle decks and manage pieces, and letting the computer do the combat math and automatically enforce the rules prevents any player from losing an encounter because they forgot to add an extra strength point from a follower that they lost in their inventory.   It's a more convenient way to play, in several regards.\n\nThat's why it's such a shame that the game is so buggy.  Sometimes the game breaks the rules in frustrating ways (spells targeting untargetable opponents, characters being unable to use abilities when they should be able to, cards that should only be used a limited number of times never disappearing from the board, etc.)  So far, every game I've played has had at least one bug that breached the rules.  They can be mildly amusing at best but game-breaking at worst.  The frequency of these bugs is the problem, as they wouldn't be much of an issue if it was just occasional.  But so far it's been every single game.\n\nThe bottom line is this: if you like Talisman, this is a pretty good version of it.  It gets all the content even if it lacks some of the streamlining it could have.  However, the frequent bugs are frustrating and having a bug break your game 90 minutes in is enough to make you not want to play again.  If the developers could take care of the bugs, I would definitely recommend getting this game.  Unfortunately, I'd now only recommend getting it on sale.","January 24, 2015","false","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have to admit I never had a chance to play the original board game - but if you had friends to play this with you, I could definately understand why you would sink Hundreds of dollars into this game. I guess I should be happy getting this for under $6.\n\nSince this is a video-game however, you still have something to get out of playing A.I. opponents. My first match took just over 2 hours, getting to know the game, and complaining to my computer enemies. All the random elements definately add a lot of spice to the flow of gameplay.

The main goal of the game is to build up your character by travelling around the board, gaining Strength and Craft by events, killing monsters, and sometimes, luck. There are three "sections" of the realm, and once you get to the inner most area with a Talisman, you attempt to kill the other players off by casting the "command spell", which has a 50% chance of all players losing one life. This is the only way to win the game, as killing the players before someone is at the center just results in that player gaining a new character.\n\nI recommend getting the Gold Pack, as the expansions make the game that much more fun to play, and the benefit of more character choices makes the strategy more varied.","June 30, 2014","true","55.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've been an owner of multiple versions of Talisman over the years and was very exicted to see this being worked on. While it has some bugs and annoyances, overall I think it's a great start. I'll go over some of the issues first.\n\n1) Random crashes. Yeah , they happen. Hopefully they clear up before it goes live as this completely ruins a live game.\n2) Bad network connectivity. People randomly just disconnect. Whats worse, is there is no way to re-join a game (that I am aware of) to continue. AI takes over.\n3) Spell casting is not intuitive. I played for over a month until i realized I can queue up a spell to automatically cast on the next players start of turn. Casting counter spell at the right time seems rough. The general responsiveness of double clicking spells is bad. Sometimes you have to click 20 times for it to actually work.\n4) No way to stop zooming into the board. This might be good for most people are a new to the game, but veterans dont need to read the board every time and would rather keep an overall look of the board. They need to make this an option.\n\nOther than these three issues, the game is great. The rules are handled very well, I have only found one or two issues I have had to report on rules. The animations dont overbear the game. The speed of turns is just right, with included features like auto-kill when there is no need to roll opposing dice.\n\nOne feature i'd like to see is allowing AI to play your turn for you while you take a bathroom break :)","February 11, 2014","true","59.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Skill does matter to a degree, but you can and will get completely destroyed by unlucky dice rolls again, and again, and again, and again. This is not a competitive skill based game and it is highly recommended you play it when you are drunk/high/give no ♥♥♥♥s otherwise your friends will get mad at you when all their dice rolls are going great and then you proceed to steal all their stuff and win while doing absolutely nothing other than steal all their stuff.\n+: The game is mostly stable after several updates and performs great although it'd be impressive if it didn't considering it's a simplistic game.\n+: The DLC works similar to PAYDAY 2 where if one person has it everyone in the same game as that person also has it except for the character classes.\n-: If you buy this game even though you hate luck based game you're gonna have a bad time.\n-: Games do take a long amount of time, upwards of 4+ hours at times.

The physical game is more expensive, especially if you end up buying all the other characters and expansions, so I would definitely suggest buying everything on steam and testing it all out to see what you like and don't like. It is also makes the rules very clear opposed to the physical copy, which makes you guess at some rules because of wording. All in all, I would suggest getting this game if you are at all interested in buying the physcal version. You may even like this version more, as you can always join tables online if you want to play but your friends are unavailable. It is sometimes buggy and won't load characters the first time you start it up and friends join, but that problem goes away the second time you start the game.

All the heros are fun, some more powerful than others, but every one of them can win if you manage to use its abilities to its full potential.\n\nAlthough there is some skill involved in this game, most of the player's performance is driven by luck. Preety much all actions (movement, combat, encounters) are defined/influenced by the dice rolls. This means that no matter how experienced you are, you can get destroyed by a noob who installed the game 10 minutes prier, which can be frustrating at times.\n\nAnother thing worth noting is that there are lots of possibilities for turning the tide in the middle of the game. This means that even if you're losing completely and the other players have much better stats than you, theres always a chance one of them will suddenly turn into a toad (and therefore leaving all objects/followers available to pickup) and allowing you to get all his stuff. Or maybe someone is about to enter the Crown of Comand (the place you need to reach to win the game) and you cast a spell on them and force him to loose his Talisman, the one object that allows them to get there. This triggers a lot of people, but i personally think it adds a lot to the game, and even though this stuff has happened to me numerous times, i end up having a laugh about it because at the end of the day, the game is fun. Just note that there's never a guaranteed win/loss, and you can always hope for a comeback or fear your demise!\n\nExpansions make the game a whole lot better, and the more you have, the more varied the game becomes and the more ways there are to make your way up to the top!\n\nPros:\n-Lots of fun with friends\n-Wide variety of heros\n-Playable on a toaster\n-Great to play at work (Tab in when it's your turn)\n-Unpredictable\n-Amazing when you have access to expansions\n-You dont have to purchase all the expansions in order to enjoy them provided that you play online with a player that owns them!\n\nCons:\n-Very luck driven\n-Games are super long\n-Not as enjoyable if you dont have access to expansions","May 30","true","107.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had never played the boardgame and went blind into this one, together with 3 other people. We imidiately spent 9-10 hours into this game. The first game we played just vanila to get to know how the game works. It was quite fun already. After that we added the expansions and the game just got even better! The game can drag on quite a bit due to it's RNG... but it's the fun type of RNG, so that's totally okay!\n\nThe goal of the game is simple. You must be the first one to reach the middle. In the vanila version, you have the crown of command there, which will do damage to each other character 50% of the times (based on a d6 roll). Characters normaly respawn/get rerolled when they die, but not when someone is in the middle. If one player is left on the board, they win.\n\nThe game features quite a lot of characters to choose from. They all have their own set of stats, aswell as a set of special abilities of which some are shared, while others are unique. The most fun way to play, though, is that everyone starts with a random character and upon death they get a new, random character! During the game you will encounter many different kinds of events, monsters and items. The more expansions you have, the more random and sometimes deadly the game becomes.\n\nI would say, if you aren't sure about buying this one. First buy the vanila version only. Once you know if you'll like it, feel free to buy the rest of the DLC, they're all worth it. Though you do not need the Runestone Deck DLC, you can unlock these ingame as far as I know.\n\nEdit: The runestones basicly give you boosts to your character: you can start with more in a stat or you can more easily upgrade your character and so forth. They seem to be designed for those who want a game that'll end more swiftly. Personally I'd suggest to play without these, unless everyone has them and you want your game to end sooner.","June 25, 2014","true","83.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But keep in mind Tailsman is a long game so a multi[player game could take 2 hours but rules can be adjusted to speed game up -- I am having plenty of fun just playing AI and gaining experience to get runestones. Also AI games can be saved and started right back up if you don't wanna play through all at once.\n\nGet the season pass I would of in retrospect gives you access to all DLC and with new characters  and expansions and more planned for soon release I would of saved more.\n\nAlso unlike a lot of Steam games I encounter the creators of this game actually update and expand.\n\nI hate new games you play once and developers take theri money and run with no concern for customers----Tailsman Does not do this--- my guess is because the physical board game Tailsman has a huge following like Axis and Allies and that they truly care.\n\nThe only downside is I think the graphics could be a little crisper or HD like  I guess but I understand need to stay true to game.\n\n10 out of 10 for me.

I have played Talisman the boardgame since 1st edition and all the further editions (3th was the worse). I have the new version and I can asure that the digital edition is exactly as the board game (some small changes but nothing that afect the overall game).\n\nthe first impresion I have of the digial version of the game was spot on as what I wanted, as close as posible to the board game, no issues with rules or mistakes made by other players. I like the dinamic of the game, sure the graphics could be better or at least some efect when making combat or magic but that is like superfluos to the game (that is what imagination is used).\n\nthe AI could be better or if you could select the level will be better (novice, normal, hard, insane).\nmaybe for more options of players, but is ok with 4 as it can be a little bothersome or tedius to wait for other players to make their move.\n\nTo any boardgame player I highly recomend it, with just one exeption, there is a lot of bugs and there is no rulebook, so sometimes you get a card to make you do someting (I had an orbe to let me change the action card if the first I get was not so good, I could not figure out how to activate it, so I did not use it). and the bigest complain I have right now is that the AI is freezed "thinking" and could not continue the game, and were are all in the crown area fighting for it... and I am  the strongest, better armed abd with more lives that the others AI !!!!! so is an almost win esenario but cant finish it, or began another game w/o losing this one.\n\nSo I recomend to buy it, with discount, and I really hope the developers correct all the bugs soon.\n\nP.S. sorry the mispellings (english not my first lenguaje) and the long rant but belive me this game (and hero quest) were the first board games I played and I am really happy with the digital version, but disapointed that is not well defined and buged.","November 27, 2014","true","13.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The season pass is 60 bucks and is supposed to offer a savings so, that gives you an idea of the price of DLC.\n\nI LOATHE the spell system though, it needed to be done differently. More often than not any 'questionable' spells (ie ones that play during others turns or counterspells) often result in mistakes or missed opportunities.  I definitely consider this a con.\n\nOverprices and terrible spell system aside, any fan of the board game should be nothing short of pleased with the digital version.

When making choices, you often have to consider the odds of an awful thing happening. Yet, even when the ONLY way something bad can happen is if I roll two 1's in a row, that's what WILL happen... and it doesn't happen infrequently. It happens over and over and over again. I've only EVER been able to get into the middle track once and no matter what character I play, the computer controlled players get nearly all good luck and I get nearly all bad luck. Frankly, it doesn't even feel like luck. It feels like the computer is actively controlling the dice rolls so it can hose me.\n\nThe game itself had ample opportunity to be enhanced graphically for a computer via animated cards and board and combat, but the developers chose to not do anything but reproduce the board and the cards exactly as they would appear when playing around a table. As a result, the computer game feels lifeless and utterly uninspired. Why not use the computer to do something the board game can't with some effects and such? The answer to that question is a mystery.\n\nThe user interface is simply horrible. Every moment of every turn is stretched out into a laborious sequence of moving and clicking. The game control elements are spread out all over the screen, so you have to move the mouse from one end of the screen to the other whenever an option is presented, rather than keeping the interface elements near one another so they are easy to use.\n\nOthers have reported a plethora of bugs. I can't say I've really encountered any, but then I've never actually played much beyond the beginning of any game. My 'luck' is SO bad that I can barely get started before I'm so far behind that catching up is impossible. It isn't much fun to continue playing when losing is a foregone conclusion, so I end up quitting to play something that is actually fun.","September 2, 2014","false","8.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game is being ever improved and i think its unfair to have these lingering reviews about its early phase just laying around stinking up the place. I've only played the vanila game but i've enjoyed every hour of it...well every hour i wasn't a dam toad. Online games are only unstable when you get a whiney ♥♥♥♥♥ that leaves cause hes not winning. The only time a person leaving was "maybe" justified was this fellow that was toaded 4 times within like 10 turns. He had the worse fate rolls I've ever seen lol. Other then that though MAKE FREINDS! I just started freinding people who stick threw games to the bitter end. I expect my list to grow as i add more hours to the ticker.\n\nIF you want a more Fact based review:\nIts a fantasy game that feels like a mix of magic the gathering and D&D. Granted its more "shallow" forms of the two but threw the Hybrid style of play it becomes deep. THIS GAME NEEDS CONTEND and it gets it threw the expansions.\nHow do i know this? GUESS WHAT! if one person who owns all the expansions sets up a game then you don't need them to still play and enjoy the expansions. Granted its a little jaring to suddenly have new characters and endings but its also a very fun renewal to adventure. Also its a great way to see if you give a dam about the 5$ dlc or not.\n________________________________________________________________________________\nUPDATE 4/3/15: So wow this game finaly has the content it needs(as DLC mind you). As of writing this its only 5$ and free to play for the weekend. This is a god dam gem right now for this price. I still hate all the DLC but if you add the expansions (not individual character dlc) it comes to a modest 25-30$. I still have yet to see a justification for a 60$ seasons pass unless you must have EVERY ounce of DLC for this game. All gripes aside. Get it for you and your freinds. Enjoy it. Turn into a taod or maybe slay a vile Cold hearted queen.

Its also great fun and probally without this game's idea's you could forget most of those great warhammer games, skyrim, baldurs gate and kiss them all goodbye.\n\nUpdate: 23 September 2014.\n\nConsidering the games time of release, the frequent bugs, latency issues and eagerness to release downloadable content (individual character cards which are not actually offical board game game cards. Whilst not addressing bug issues first, has resulted in compounding errors/crashes due to adding cards from introduced cards from the expansions that have not been coded properly to new merge abilties for example with older ones.\n\nUpdate 2/12/2014\n\nSince the Dungeon Expansion...\n\nI recommend this game now on the basis the decks are a lot better, the new board and characters are amazing. A lot of bugs have been fixed (still a few kicking around). House rules implimented including the "standard character" rule for true fans who do not wish for the overpriced $2 dlc cards pay to win implimented.\n\nAnother great feature is now you can add and remove players while in lobby instead of totally rehosting. Not only to mention that players who only have the base game can join any game and still use all the dlc so long as the host has provided them. This paves way for those who really like the game and encourages those not sure to buy the base first and not feel being ripped off so bad.\n\nI would recommend buying this, and make sure the dungeon is on!","December 29, 2013","true","375.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is often critisized for being overly dependent on luck at the expense of strategy by those who deride such types of games.  I like to refer to it as fantasy Monopoly, where instead of property you go around collecting objects and followers (and battle enemy monsters and players) until you're powerful enough to win the game.\n\nDespite its detractors, Talisman has maintained a passionate, loyal and extremely devoted following.  Like Monopoly, its appeal lies in its simple, light-hearted and accessible nature that isn't complicated, difficult or overly strategic.  In other words, the very things it is criticised for.  That's not to say there aren't strategic elements but they're certainly not dominant.  It's a game you can wistfullly play while the hours pass by (and I do mean hours) without thinking too much.  If that's not to your liking, there are plenty of other more serious games to consider.\n\nTalisman benefits enormously from the digital transition which has been implemented fairly well, with some exceptions.  Most notably are occasional bugged rules and weak AI players, but these don't detract too much from the enjoyment of the game.  I was pleasently surprised by the friendliness of online players also.\n\nIf you appreciate light-hearted and fun games that anyone can pick up or enjoy board games with great artwork on the board and the cards then I can highly recomment Talisman.  I have over 100 hours logged so far and I find it's a great (and addictive) distraction and great to take your mind off things.\n\nI should note that the base game is a little bare and Talisman benefits when played with some of the expansions.  The season pass is also fairly pricey, but I got it on sale so I think it's good value if you can wait until a sale.  Given the number of characters and expansions I can't recommend buying them separetely.  You really have to go all in and get the season pass if you want the extra content.  It's not worth buying expansions in dribs and drabsm but if you had to I'd say Reaper, Frostmarch and Sacred Pool are recommended first because they don't add extra boards (regions) that chcange the game a bit.","February 17","true","218.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've played the tabletop version of Talisman before and always thought it was an awful game. I love board games, have dozens of them, but Talisman... It takes the features of games like Monopoly and other trail games and try to entice you with a mildly interesting (though generic) fantasy setting, but the truth is it remains as boring, flawed and outdated as Monopoly itself.\n\nThe game may drag for hours and hours without an ending in sight and everything is about randomness. There's no skill involved playing in Talisman, all you can do push your luck in a general direction and hope for the best. I understand why a game like this would be popular 20 or 30 years ago, but today we have plenty of better board (and digital) games to play. Maybe *huge* fans of Mario Party would enjoy playing digital Talisman, but I just can't recommend it to anyone else. You want to play "digital board games" on Steam? Grab "Small World 2", "Ticket to Ride" or anything else, but stay away from Talisman.","April 4, 2015","false","5.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I was pretty patient about it, I faithfully reported bugs when I saw them and waited months but rather than fix the old content they kept shoveling out new content. Making Android and Itunes adaptions and adding the expansion with a half ♥♥♥♥♥ game production.\n\n\nThe UI is terrible, it places the “accept” and “drop” button as close as possible to each other making it very easy to misclick. It lacks any sense of forethought or planning.\n\nThe AI is a roomba bot gone rogue. It attacks the same players over and over even though it will obviously lose. It has almost no sense for self preservation and almost always dies. Or it cheats when it gets certain objects like the magic carpet and rolls 6's non stop.\n\nThe games had so many bugs from the beginning the developers have failed to either realize themselves or fix themselves. If they needed more money than they should have made the game advertisement supported with a paid option for people who didn't want the ads. This would have brought in a larger player base and gave people the chance to try it out. They also could have given the starting game for free and then sold the expansion and characters for more.\n\nThe general stability of the game is terrible, it crashes so often, that games frequently have to be resumed. Resume is the one saving grace of this game but in spite of all of that, the general incompetence of the developers ruins what could otherwise be a wonderful game.\n\nI can't recommend this game to anyone until the developers stop shoveling new content and fix what they have now.","August 19, 2014","false","777.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

Clunky UI makes playing a harsh experience. Others mentioned that this was a mobile port and it shows. Settings are limited and it will reset some of the options every time you restart the game. Some features, like speeding up or skipping animations are not available, which tends to drag games even longer than required.\n\nHas some technical issues. With nearly 10 hours gametime, there has been couple crashes. Also, one friend kept having connection issues for unknown reason. Luckily, the session can be restored but it still requires extra time. Cashing on too many DLCs and extra junk that could have been easily bundled in bigger packages. Luckily, only the server has to buy them so that others can play with additional content. Some of the characters are much stronger than others which brings balancing issues.\n\nCore game mechanic relies too heavily on dice, especially in the early game. As most of the actions are ruled by the dice, one can find hero facing only dragons, giants and ogres with their two point strength weakling. This results in frustration as the player cannot really do anything except pray for better luck. Situation becomes ever worse with the DLCs as they bring even more monsters which makes encounters even more random. Core game could use separate decks for outer and middle regions. This way outer region could give more certain, but slow, early progress and middle region faster but more risky way.\n\nUsually some of the players get lucky in the early game and snowball out of control. When hero gets enough resources, they start to win battles automatically which makes them even stronger. Single game can easily last two hours as the early winning players makes certain that they are unbeatable until finishing the game.\n\nSummary: technically shoddy and somewhat lacking playing experience. Can be fun with friends. Recommended only for Talisman fanatics. Others should avoid or enjoy the life as a toad.","December 28, 2014","false","13.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

But if you don't mind that, it's not a bad game.  Believe the devs when they say the dice don't cheat?  You cannot convince me.  Here is just one tale of one game I played:\n\nYes, I have read that they claim all dice rolls are generated before the game even starts and the order doesn't change, ie no cheating dice.  I call BS.  Pushed my way to the crown and suddenly of the 3 AI players, 2 start doing everything they can to help/save the 4th.  The fourth starts making amazing rolls and I realize I'm only getting above a 3 one in seven rolls.  Amazing given it should be roughly 50/50 chance.  But for 40 rolls I only get 6 above a 3.  Because the other 2 AI were even using their healing spells on the 4th that means it was down to me and that 4th AI.  He bounces around the board always managing to land any time I get manage to get his health down by 2, collect 7 followers, 7 items, crazy stats, and heads for the portal that's been up since the start of the game.  About this time I get him down to 1 health and think, "Surely, this must be almost over."  Two rounds later he gets to the portal and of course rolls a 6 putting him in the Plains near the end.  Three rounds later he has rolled a 1 at the vampire and a 1 at the Pitfiends.  He's still at 1 health and I've now rolled 7 times less than a 4.  He keeps coming and I keep failing to roll above a 3.  Right before he gets to the crown I manage to roll a 6 and take him out.  The game sustained a 1 in 7 chance of rolling a 4, 5, or 6 on a six sided die for an hour.  Just me clicking "next" cause once you get to the crown there's nothing else you can do.  Exciting.

When Talisman came out, i did not hesitate to get it and have not stopped playing it since. i only got Steam Talisman working in a Windows VM today, so Steam still rates me as a Noobite, but i've got well over 200 Talisman sessions behind me on Android. It is a near-perfect rendition of the board game (which i have also bought since becoming a fan). Many consider it to be too random, but the fact is that it holds a lot of strategy (part of which is dealing with the randomness). Talisman is _easily_ my most-played Android game, and now that Steam works on my desktop machine (via a Windows VM), it will certainly become my most-played non-Android/non-Linux game as well.\n\nIf any notable degree of randomness just makes you angry, don't try Talisman, but if you're looking for a lighthearted beer-and-pretzels style fantasy romp, Talisman might just fit the bill in epic form.\n\nTip for new players: PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, LEARN THE GAME IN SOLO MODE BEFORE PLAYING ONLINE!!!! Few things are more frustrating in online play than having to wait for new players to read every single card and every single square every single turn. So please, for the love of your fellow players, play it solo _AT LEAST 50 TIMES_ before playing online. Learn 90%+ of the cards and board spaces by heart. Your fellow players will appreciate it and will stop dropping out of games which you cause to drag on for 2 hours longer than necessary because you didn't do your homework before playing. Please. Thank you.","October 16, 2015","true","14.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Originally playing with AI characters was kind of a nightmare, but the updates have improved their "decision" making skills, gameplay is still best with friends though. If you're not already a fan of table tops then this could become boring for anyone, since it takes a while for someone to win. However, having the expansions, thanks to a season pass, makes it most enjoyable. When I had the basic version it was limiting and I lost interest, fortunately sales come around often providing a great time to grab it. The pass is a good deal; the artwork and variety of characters definitely improve with each new package. I also like the idea of being able to play anytime, anywhere without worrying about finding space and set up.","November 22, 2015","true","116.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game can get very cut-throat and you will enjoy lots of laughs at the expese of other player's misfortune. The expansions make the game even more enjoyable and there are different game rules available that can make the game more exciting. If I was recommending this on the gameplay alone, I would definitely give it a great review.\n\nThat being said, this game is TERRIBLE when it comes to programming. It is full of game-stopping glitches that should have been weeded out during development. Nothing is more frustrating than to be two hours into a highly competitive and exciting game, only to have it RUINED by a glitch that will not allow the game to contine. The matchmaking is shotty at best, and the lack of a save feature to save and resume multiple games outside of the single automatic game save really gets on your nerves. This game is not worth buying unless GW fixes the bugs that are killing this game.","April 14, 2015","false","25.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Don't know what it is?  Think Fantasy Monopoly and you sort of have the idea, only instead of buying properties and gathering cash and boning your friends, you're fighting monsters, gathering treasure, gambling money, and... well, boning your friends.  It's an all-time classic board game.\n\nOnly downside is they charge about the same amount for the DLC as they do for the real game's expansions, so if you actually can get a good regular gaming group together, getting the actual game is probably a much better course of action for you.\n\nNote: as of this writing, the DLC list has shrunk down to three, so the above comment may no longer be valid, but during the Early Access, you could see listed all the expansions for the physical game at the same price.  This may turn up later.\n\nEDIT: Don't know why my play counter is 0.

The expansions make the game even more enjoyable and there are different game rules available that can make the game more exciting. If I was recommending this on the gameplay alone, I would definitely give it a great review.\n\nThat being said, this game is TERRIBLE when it comes to programming. It is full of game-stopping glitches that should have been weeded out during development. Nothing is more frustrating than to be two hours into a highly competitive and exciting game, only to have it RUINED by a glitch that will not allow the game to contine. The matchmaking is shotty at best, and the lack of a save feature to save and resume multiple games outside of the single automatic game save really gets on your nerves.

Do you own boardgames? Do you play them with your friends (hopefully!)? Than this game CAN definatly be for you. But it also depends on how much nostalgia you feel for Talisman.

And you also lose the feeling of moving components around on a board which is a huge part of the enjoyment for this game.\n\nIf you're a not a boardgamer I would recomend that you stay away from this game. It probably wont meet up with any (if any) of your expectations. This game can be fun with a few friends but you will probably end up only playing a single game of it before moving on to some other game or you know... any other REAL boardgame.\n\nTalisman in general is sadly not a great boardgame nomatter how much nostalgia you feel for it.\nIt's basicly a more nerdy version of Monopoly which is the worst... boardgame... ever.

It makes for a great way to kill some time, and is very easy to pick up and get into.","July 8, 2014","true","63.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Started playing it last week w/ my 10-yr old.  We're having F-U-N-!-!  However, he has a curfew, and I have a long work commute, so we play maybe 30 minutes a night and it's slow.  Still fun.  However, I found this Digital Edition, and O My God is it FUN!  Just won my first match ever (boardgame or PC) and it was awesome.  I think what I like most about it is that the Digital Edition really enforces the rules quite a bit on what I would have considered "grey areas" of the original rules for the boardgame.  I am very fond of this game and would highly recommend this over the Prologue edition.  Prologue does NOT allow you to play with at least one other AI opponent, and that kind of sucks!  You learn a lot more playing with a full-on opponent.  This one tonight (Priest) in particular really had me on the ropes, the one I played last night (Assasin) not so much.  Any Hearthstone players out there?  Give this a shot - much MORE strategy and the animations are just as fun!

This game takes hours to complete. The online games take even longer. Those three  reasons are what stopped me from trying this out earlier but I did try it out and I was NOT disappointed. Despite the length, most people who you play with online are super friendly and super fun to play with, which basically ends up making the length an advantage (more time = more fun). And the game itself is amazing! It's like playing a full scale MMORPG (an RPG if you don't like online play xD)! It's a game, a board game, that truly does require a huge amount of strategy. It's not just "roll you dice, move on, get to the end first", it's about thinking of where to go, what to do, how to get what you want and so on. And it's not very straightforward either, it's quite complex and utterly wonderful in all aspects. To sweeten the pot, it even has several modes and expansions to make sure you never get bored of playing! A 5/5 game if I ever played one.\n\nEDIT: I must admit that after a while, the game does get quite boring and repetitive. If you can find a group of players and form a group (relatively speaking) to play, then sure, it'll give you hours of enjoyment without fail! Besides, considering how long a game takes, you'll probably end up playing it once or twice a week, in which case it'll provide you with years of fun!\n\nOne thing I have noticed, however, is that the community has died down quite a bit. Ever since the "free weekend" ended, the number of games in the lobby is three in the maximum and that's in the European server (which, ironically, is the busiest). Once again, if you've got a group of friends to play with every once in a while, I'd recommend this game without a single moment of hesistation!","April 6, 2015","true","77.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jinsaku/recommended/247000/","jinsaku","Jinsaku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jinsaku/","1022 products in account","One of the best board games of a long past era, Talisman evokes the core of 1980s RNG heavy dice rolling board games. For those of us who lived in that time, before Germany came along and showed the world how great board games can be, this is a well realized throwback nostalgia title.\n\nThat's not to say Talisman is a great board game. It's really not. It's exceptionally RNG heavy and can be frustrating at times. But, it's also pretty fun. Particularly when playing with a group of friends over Skype, Mumble, etc. The game itself is very easy to learn. Roll a die. Move. Do what's on the board. Try to improve your character enough to get to the center, defeat the challenge, and win the game.\n\nThe software implementation of Talisman by Nomad is pretty good. The animations and sounds are good, the graphics are pretty, and it plays the way you would expect. We've only run into a few bugs, one game-breaking, over a bunch of sessions. One of the really nice things Nomad did was allow the host's version of Talisman to be played. I have the full season pack, and a bunch of my friends have the core game only. I host, and we can play with all of the expansions.\n\nThere are 3 expansions out so far. The best one at the moment is The Dungeon, which adds a large board segment to one of the corners. I'm very much looking forward to when all of the expansions are out and you can play a big mega game.\n\nGame time can run a bit long. While this is faster than the tabletop version, budget about one hour per player per game.\n\nI recommend, but this definitely isn't for everyone. I sunk about 100 hours into Talisman Prologue (which was their single-player "Beta" version of this and about a dozen hours so far for the full release. This is a fun one to pull out once in a while with friends, like any good board game.","December 24, 2014","true","55.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","3"

I spent many, many hours as a kid beating... I mean, "questing" with my friends.\n\nWe'd all be sitting on the carpet in the living room, game pieces scattered thither, huddled around the game board as if we were spying into one our dads' Playboy magazines trying not to get caught. Tensions ran high as we traversed the outer ring of the board (or Outer Earth as we called it) in search of glorious adventure and immense wealth.\n\nEventually, one friend would amusingly decide to try to kill off another; starting a great fued betwixt families, and a furious battle would ensue. With every roll of the dice, the once trusting and playful comrades, would try to land on each others spaces to chip off yet another foe's life. All in the hopes of being the last warrior standing... until of coarse... the final blow was struck... the fallen combatant, silent in his shame, with head hung low, would sit and let the anger of defeat fester like a boil. As the heckling and laughter of his friends grew louder, ringing in his ears, becoming too much to bear, the conquered warrior would growl in rage! Leaping up from the game and running away like the wind. Totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥! He'd jump upon his iron steed, and peddle off into the night, cursing us. Claiming he would never play with us... ever... again.\n\nBut... we knew he'd be back.\n\nNow that I'm a grown-up (or at least supposed to be), this digital version still lets me enjoy beating... I mean "questing" with my friends, even though we're scattered across the globe. It's awesome. And. it's a perfect game for hanging out with the guys online, having a few beers, and sharing a few laughs.\n\nIt's a great port of the board game. It's challenging, and the DLC is great.

I've had numerous glitches occur, and some aspects of the interface are rather annoying. My biggest complaint so far is having played a game as a Ninja the victory condition made it impossible to win. I was required to obtain 2 followers and then discard them in order to complete a Warlock Quest. Ninjas can not have followers. Therefore  I couldn't win. I got a cursed item that made me lose all of my quests, which I used to get rid of that quest and go take a different Warlock quest, to which the game made me take the same quest again, with no roll or anything even though the spot said to roll for it. I did have some irratations with the interface, but those could be avoided once a player becomes familiar with the game. The games been out long enough that really big glitches like this should probably have been patched out. Theres also very squirly things with the NPC players where they will often drag on their turns for a while picking up every single item on a square, and then put every item back down because they lack inventory space, even though they won't take any of the actual items. I could go on, but I got the game for a steal so I can't complain too much. Thinking im going to go buy the board game now though.

Tensions ran high as we traversed the outer ring of the board (or Outer Earth as we called it) in search of glorious adventure and immense wealth.\n\nEventually, one friend would amusingly decide to try to kill off another; starting a great fued betwixt families, and a furious battle would ensue. With every roll of the dice, the once trusting and playful comrades, would try to land on each others spaces to chip off yet another foe's life. All in the hopes of being the last warrior standing... until of coarse... the final blow was struck... the fallen combatant, silent in his shame, with head hung low, would sit and let the anger of defeat fester like a boil. As the heckling and laughter of his friends grew louder, ringing in his ears, becoming too much to bear, the conquered warrior would growl in rage!

Dying from a gut seeping wound might be more enjoyable. If you reach the crown before the AI, you better expect to choke hard and roll absolutely abysmal. If you think the AI is doing something stupid? It's because the AI has decided to give you this illusion before three turns later it's suddenly twice as strong wielding magic faster than a video game player can blame a computer for his failings. This game is not your friend. This game hates you. This game lives off of your suffering. Any achievement is to lull you into a false sense of security.

It is definitely best played with a group of friends which you can converse with. To be entirely honest, it is not that great if you play against the AI. The AI has this ability to screw themselves in ways that are entirely possible to avoid with a little bit of thought. For instance, the AI will use an axe to get across the river only to cross back to the outer area the next turn.\n\nI would highly recommend this to people which enjoy tabletop games which contain both an element of strategy and an element of luck. There is a lot in this game which requires luck, but once you have played a few games, you can get a feel of what the better spaces and strategies are. Playing with random characters also forces you to get used to new ways of playing the game, making each game much different from the last.\n\nKeep in mind, a single string of bad luck can pretty much end your run in the game or force you to play catch up for the remainder of the game if everyone else is doing well.","January 25, 2015","true","13.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've played a few matches and although game is complex (great), rich and detailed (excellent) and full of amazing details and additional content (nice, nice, supernice), I've always had a feeling I am being cheated out of dice rolls. Even compared to Chainsaw Warrior, card game that really snuffs out the players 9 out of 10 times, this game always felt way too artificial under the colorful hood.\n\nWell now...\n\nI've uninstalled the game and reinstalled it today when I saw there's a Humble Bundle package with some additional content available for a low price. I was just about to buy and indulge in playing muted Talisman and listening to audiobook again when a buddy of mine made me read a shocking post by a developer himself.\n\nThat post is available at Steam's community hub for Talisman: Digital Edition and it explains in detail the horrid decision of game devs that I really don't understand at all.\n\nThe most important part is this one and no, it's not taken out of context:\n\n"At the start of a new game, a huge list of random numbers between 1 and 6 is generated. That list of numbers is used for the whole game, in the order that they are determined at this point."\n\nI understand it this way - in the game based on factor of random dice rolls, you get a predetermined row of numbers which influence your moves. There are no true random dice rolls, no luck. Only a rigging generator.\n\nThis decision truly crushes my enthusiasm to play this game any longer and to buy any new content.

I don't know if you can still buy them, but back then you could get, like, a dozen expansions that came with additional game boards like a dungeon and one that allowed you to travel through space. My brother and I liked playing the expansions more than the vanilla game because every expansion added these wicked overpowered new characters and objects and instead of the usual gameplay strat of "just travel around the outer region for a half an hour to level up before going towards the middle" it became "bum rush the space lanes to get the laser rifle and the anti-grav belt and spend the next fifteen minutes griefing the other players until they get mad and give up".\n\nDad says: If you like this kind of nerd ♥♥♥♥, it's a pretty good buy at $5, but bear in mind that the vanilla game will get old after a couple of hours once you're familliar with all the cards and/or you don't have actual people to play with on mumble. You'll be wanting to get some of the expansions if you enjoy it and those will cost like $5 each, but they should mix up the game enough that you'll find lots of added enjoyment. I really can't recommend paying full price for everything unless you're one of those board game spergs.","July 1, 2014","true","1.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","3"

What i mean by this, is that he would honestly get down to 1 life point remaining and then miraculously roll the die into the perfect number to land on a square in which he could heal. It did not also help that he had a card that gave him a minimum of 1 gold at all times. The game finally ended when the AI moved him into the most inner ring where he had no methods of self healing.\n\nOverall it's a great game and lives up to the experiences i've had through the actual irl gameboard.

Aka, roll a dice over and over until you win or lose. The lack of strategy and the high percentage of luck mean that the hour long games that are needed to complete Talisman feel like little more than flipping a coin over and over to see who gets more tails than the other.\n\nSo 5/10 from me... but if you see this for a buck and want a few hours novelty, it could be worth it!","May 18","true","5.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Whilst I have many fond memories of Talisman from my childhood, this is a terrible implementation of a game that has long past exceeded its best-by date.\n\nTalisman itself is sadly lacking in the current era of boardgames, with little to no strategy or choice left to the player. It is dictated far more by the random roll of the die, than any particular desire of the player. Even Monopoly provides more strategy, and choice of action. This is a faithful implementation of the original, for what little that is worth.\n\nThe main issue is the interface, which is an abomination. Trying to play with friends rapidly becomes an excercise in extreme frustration, wherein you battle the shoddy controls - instead of battling your friends. Laggy, unresponsive and unintuitive are the nicest words I have to say about it. I wish I could refund it, and I feel terrible for gifting it to several of my friends who now all have a much poorer opinion of me.\n\nIf you have any fondness for Talisman, any decent memories of the game - leave them as that, memories.

The programmers haven't solved that problem well at all. Computer opponents don't have much strategy besides accumulating stats and items. They perform like mediocre bots in the single-player training missions of an online FPS. A human player would wipe the table with them every time, except the AI appears to get a boost via favorable die rolls and card draws, likely to disguise its lack of real strategy. The first few games this doesn't matter much, but after dozens of games it sucks the enjoyment out of it.\n\nIf you have 3 friends willing to play the game with you, I'd buy this game in a heartbeat. If you're going to fill in with computer players--and especially if you just want to play single-player--this is probably a pass.\n\nFor that reason--plus constant problems connecting with servers resulting in interrupted games--I have to give this game a no vote even though I generally like it.

At that price, you really can't go that wrong.  That being said, this game really walks the line between whether or not to give it a positive or a negative review overall.\n\nThe design flaws of the Talisman game really manifest itself when you play with a rigid, impassionate interpreter of the game.   This doesn't seem like a bad thing, but Talisman has evolved over the years with very little consistency: there's a huge variety of nuances in the language used.  Phrases such as "...at any time..." implies a different expectation than what is actually practiced in the game.\n\nThe honest truth is, people zone out when they play Talisman.  You miss a few turns in jail, or wait for four other players to battle dragons, abuse spells, and ponder over quests; just so you can roll a 3 and scoop up a bag of gold.  There's a whole layer missing from the electronic version of the game that you get when you are playing on the tabletop with your friends that really is the only thing that makes Talisman an acceptable use of an afterrnoon.\n\nThe game would also benefit from an ability to remove specific cards from out of the deck; because there are some really grossly imbalanced combinations as well as cards you just get sick of seeing- like the one that takes all the face up city cards and put them on top of the adventure deck.  The electronic version of the game also takes longer to play, as every step of the game is iterated out individually.  The dice roller seems very suspect as well.  I've had back to back snake eyes when dicing with death as well as +3 Craft from the Reaper in three stops.\n\nThe game does give you something to do while your waiting in a que or auto-running to your next mission, but it's hard to recommend solely on the experience it offers.  To be honest, considering how horribly overpriced the Fantasy Flight version of the game is, I would still recommend this version of the game over the table top version.  I'm sticking with my 2nd Edition Games Workshop version.","December 1, 2015","false","53.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

There's a board. There are cards, characters and a die. Great.\n\nUnfortunately once you actually start to play you realize pretty quickly that you're dealing with a tablet port that's had oodles of time put into it on the dlc-front, but not so much on  the optimizing-for-pc front. There's the base game, then several expansions, then I don't even know how many characters for a buck or three apiece, and there ain't a thing wrong with any of that assuming the game plays well and stable on the average pc.\n\nThat's where things begin to break down. There's a very long-standing and unresolved bug affecting a lot of people wherein if you afk from the game for anything more than about 60 seconds or so you'll return to a frozen screen, which you can only "fix" by force-closing the game in Task Manager and restarting. There's thread after thread after report after report on the Discussions page, and each says the same thing: "File a bug report and email it to us w/a log" and that's about it. There's been no solution to date, one year on, but boy oh boy have there been dlc galore in that time.\n\nThe game interface itself is, to be charitable, minimal. There's very little in the way of options in the settings menu, in the main game UI you'll be left to pretty much figure things out on your own since there's no tutorial of any kind, and no game manual that I've ever been able to find that outlines basic rules, etc. I played the game for months before realizing that I could click on the bar at the top of the screen that shows the current turn, and that that would show me details about turn events like card text, who rolled what, and so on.\n\nIn the same vein there are very, very few input options. You may use your mouse, and... that's almost it. Again, I played for months before discovering that clicking the spacebar = selecting whatever option is at the top right on your screen, be it "encounter space" or "move here" or whatever. There are no keys that do anything else whatsoever that I've seen. Again this is something that's been requested for a year on the forums, the ability to map some keys to common actions, and from what I can see the response has been the same every time: "Because it would take a lot of time to code for different OS's, the game is kept basically in a tablet state to make it simpler on us devs". Again, that constraint hasn't stopped them pumping out character and expansion dlc. That's the gist of it, anyway, so ask yourself if you want to pay 15 bucks for a tablet game on your pc.\n\nGame bugs: no shortage of 'em. Spell queueing is hit and miss, at best. Sometimes they work as you expect, other times they don't fire off at all or they do but not where you intended. There are cards that don't work at all in certain situations and cards that work in unexpected ways in others. Multiplayer games freeze and/or disconnect a random person, in addition to the aforementioned single player freeze.\n\nThere is little to no hovertext, which in a game where you're forced to play with your mouse almost exclusively leads to a LOT of clicking. If you want to remind yourself what stipulations exist on a certain game square, for instance, you must click that square. This is fine unless you accidentally double-click, which is easy enough to do, at which point your character *moves* to that square whether you're finished reading its text or not. The same goes for many cards like spells or potions. Be careful clicking on them if you're simply trying to read them. One extra click and poof! there goes that spell you totally didn't intend to cast yet.\n\nI could go on but there's not much point. It *is* a game, and it *is* playable, but it isn't all that enjoyable to me to the point I'd recommend it to anyone, and the reason I go so far as to give it a thumbs down is simple: after months of waiting, pleading, begging the devs to show a little love to the pc community (whose money they seem to love enough, alright) their response was to post a new thread announcing an upcoming new Talisman game they're working on. Presumably we were all meant to shout "Yay! Take my money!", but to me it felt like someone who'd just mugged me asking if I'd like to buy my wallet back.\n\nAgain, if you're a hardcore fan of the original, this will probably fulfill your digital desire to play, but it ain't gonna be a bug-free or hassle-free experience. If you're new to the gamel I'd recommend giving it a pass, unless the devs decide to pay it the attention they should've been paying from the start.","February 2","false","86.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The worst one even doesn't let you start the multiplayer match in 4 out of 5 tries, when the option "Character selection" (out of 3 Chars) is enabled, which usually is enabed for fair play. When this happens, the first player doesn't get a hero to choose from and so the room needs to be rehosted. More than that, the game crashes randomly or you just disconnect from the server, with sometimes beeing unable to rejoin the game. I've made a 4 player match where one player left the game at the beginning. Not a big deal, it happens often and the KI took over and the remaining three players continued to play for three hours. Then the player who left returned, which caused a crash to the other three players, while one was already at the crown and the game would have ended 10 minutes later. Great, three hours played for noting than frustration. The commentary of the returning player: "Oh, I made it back right in time".

However, I am talking about the original board game, not the digital edition. I am not going to describe the single player feature as it is very poor and AI does not demand any thinking from the player, making the single player game easy, boring and discouraging. Therefore, I will concetrate on the multiplayer feature since it is the only feature worth looking at.\n\nThe rules are very simple: roll a dice, move that many spaces, draw a card or cards, read them and d what the instruction tells you to do. Simple isn't it? Well, for developers it is not simple. The game is full of bugs and developers insist on working on new addons instead of correcting existing bugs. In other words - the game is not finished and really rushed and I need to point out it was released a long time ago. Too long for such issues to happen.\n\nThe game can freeze or crash just after loading it. I experienced game freeze on the main menu several times - solution, do not leave the game on the title screen or it will stop responding. You will be forced to start the game again and/or start Steam again, and/or reboot your system.\nThe game was not properly tested before release and it is more than obvious.\nA lot of cards do not work as they are supposed to. Many card effects lead to a dead end as you will not be able to do anything (I see that problem with many spells while casted on other players). Example: after casting for example, Misfortune spell on the opponent, the game stopped responding and did not give any player any opportunity to make their moves, the game stops, the timeout counter freezes and you or any other player is forced to leave the game in order to make it move on.\nConnection issues occur every game. Some players are kicked out of the server for no reason. Sometimes you cannot go back to the game you were playing.\nAfter joining the server and starting or looking for a game, your game can stop responding, forcing you to reboot your game and ocassionally your Steam and/or your system.\nWho put Quit button in the Settings? Standing ovation for the analysts/architects/developers and anyone responsible for this sensible chuckle design. I laughed, my friends laughed. Good comedy.\nThere is no way to speed up the game play. It goes very long and I played some games for such a long time that I do not recall any actual board games to last that long (and I played with 7 people at a time!). You have to wait for every action even if no action is available at the moment. For example: even though you have only one choice, the system does not automatically go with the only choice but waits for you to select it. Bad idea.\nThere is a number cards that do not work properly or do not work at all and when it comes tot he interaction betwen some cards, majority of such situations lead to a glitch, mostly forcing you to rejoin the game or restarting it.\nEach new addon comes with a new set of bugs. Beware.\nRandom Number Generator is really poor and developers should think before they do something rigged as this. There is a chance that you will throw "1" for about 5-10 times in a row which is impossible if you were really rolling dice. This NEEDS to be fixed. I remember rolling the same set of numbers several times in a row. Bad development. There is no explanation for such bad execution of dice roll simulation.\nYou can be kicked out of the game without any chance (yes!) for coming back. The game tends to bug out and nothing can be done to go back to it. Progress is lost. The most disappointing.\nInviting your Steam friends is very buggy. I have never successfully invited anyone without a crash, so I do not use that feature.\n\n\nTL;DR - If you want to play the great game which is Talisman - go and buy the original board game, you will never have to reboot anything, wait for anything to happen, look at bugs, being surprised that nothing what the card described happened. Digital edition is faw away from being a good product. It is fair for now, but it is closer and closer to being bad if noone takes care of basics like card working.\n\nLess development on new addons, more at bug fixing, please.\n\nI paid $1 for the game and that's how much it is worth\n\n\nPros:\n\n- Classic Talisman game!\n- Many addons and characters that make games more interesting\n- You do not need addons to actually play them, only one person in the game needs them\n- Very good music\n- The cards are taken straight from the board game version!\n\n\nCons:\n\n- The game is not finished\n- Bugs literally ruin the game experience\n- Connection issues that seem to go worse with time\n- No way to join the game that is currently in progress - in the board version that's what makes this game so attractive, no matter how many people are currently playing, you can always join\n- Bad mutliplayer and overall game issues force players to leave the game early (ruining the game)\n- Less and less players (20 average) playing the game online (which is very sad)\n\n\nDo not get me wrong = the game is fun but the way it was developed forces you to abandon the idea of playing. Board games are not supposed to be that frustrating when it comes to gameplay. This game would be better if not rushed so much. If developers concetrated on the Basis of the game instead of looking for easy cash selling characters or addons - I would recommend it 100%. Sadly, I cannot do that and reasons for it are mentioned above.\n\nThese issues are serious as I see less and less players online.","November 7, 2015","false","90.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

Play as one of many classic fantasy archetypes such as an elf, wizard, monk, thief (and many more!) as you gain experience, powerful items/weapons, followers, spells and so on. Adventure around the board until you're ready to tackle the dreaded inner region, reach the Crown of Command, and claim victory!\n\nIf you like gameplay that is all about playing the odds, you'll probably enjoy yourself in Talisman. At first glance it seems like a simple roll-and-move game where the player has little control over what happens to them during any given turn, but it's actually very involved as winning requires understanding how to create good odds for yourself. It's also a game where you need to understand that bad things WILL happen and there's nothing you could've done about it; or even if you lost a fight you shoulda won - it's ok because 80% odds in your favor means you'll still lose 20% of the time.\n\nTalisman is a very interesting mix of a laid back casual game (because of how simple any given turn is) and also a very cutthroat game. Players will clash in many PvP battles over the course of a game and powerful items will switch hands as players take them from each other through force or other means. You'll need to always take into account the other players, knowing which ones you should target and which ones will target you.\n\nSo if you like fantasy adventure and gameplay that's all about navigating the wims of random luck, I highly recommend Talisman. It's a light game that manages to capture that feeling of going on an epic quest and overcoming great challenges. There's a reason this game is still around despite many bigger and more involved adventure board games being released since the 80s, so play this digital adaptation and find out what makes Talisman so special.\n","December 15, 2013","true","289.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I hate that it's negative, but I am way too ticked off at this game NOT to give it a negative review. Second, this game makes me wish I had bought it AFTER the Stean refund policy change. I would refund this pile in a heartbeat. Now let me get into the things I hated about the game. Also, for the most part, you are not going to read anything here that are not in the other reviews. If you like the board game, you might like this if you don't crash. If not my gripes are similair to others\n\nSo, I bought this game a few months ago, but never got around to playing it. I left Neverwinter Nights, and get a pop-up saying if I buy a character for Talisman the profits with go to charity. Great! I love to help charity. And it is a shaman. Shamans and Druids are some of my favorite characters. So load up the game, and search the main page for a tutorial. There's none, which is troubling, but I figure, 'hey, it's probably a tutorial as you play kind of game'. Which it is. Problem is you ghave to choose your character with stats that you have NO CLUE what they do. So I do what I always do in a fantasy game where I'm not sure about the mechanics. I pick the Warrior, because it is almost aways the easiest class. I also make sure there is only one  opponent, because i wanted the make the game as easy as possiblee.\n\nThen I get into the game. My first turn I roll, get a 6 move to the temple. My whole strategy tois to get the two weapons that the fighter can have, then play from there. I roll again, then have to fight an ape. I lose. No prob. It's the beginning of the game, and I can't expect to win every dice roll. Now I don't remember all my opponents turns, (partly because he was taking turns when I was reading text) but basically he didn't have ONE bad thing happen on any of his turns. So, I take my thirds turn and fight a creature with craft, and lose again. Next turn, roll again, got a dragon, lost again. Now mind you, you don't get a choice on whether to fight or not. Some classes give some choice in some situations, but mostly, roll and get blssed or f-d. So, I'm down 3 lives, and have some event where I lose ANOTHER LIFE! My opponent. Again, my opponent has lost no life, and hasn't even had to fight. I am a WARRIOR and I have won no fights. I just want a weapon. So I spend my one gold to get back 1 hp because I am at one HP. THEN I get the second gold that would have allowed me to get a weapon.  Then I roll a demon which I would have to roll a 6 to tie. So back to 1 hp. At this point I say F this game. So I want to see what happens when you die, so I attack the creature with craft (magic) because he should have an advantage. And THEN I win. *Faceplam*\n\nAnyway I was done within 5 minutes of that. My opponent was already in the second ring. This game is JUST RANDOM LUCK. I own 600 on Steam, (though I've prob only played a little over 500 of them) and this will likely wind up on the bottom 50 of them.","June 10, 2015","false","0.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You wanted to prevent people from reloading a game and possibly rolling a better RANDOM roll? **WRONG** The same principle can be used by that same person because they know what the next roll is going to be and they just reload and choose a different course or action.

I've won this game nearly every time I played and I never left with a feeling of satisfaction. The interface of this game is atrocious. You can never make moves efficiently and half the time it is not clear how to use the cards you possess. And pray to the gods that you or your opponents never lose connection temporarily. The worst case scenario- the games takes a dump and everything goes to hell; the best case scenario- the atrocious AI takes over and immediate proceeds to ram as many items as it can into its own eyeballs in an attempt to impress the other players with its edgy suicide performance art.\n\nReally this is a terrible video game implementation of a terrible board game. I've yet to play a game that lasted less than 90min and most have lasted at least 3hrs. It takes no skill to win and the game frequently misinterprets spells or just plain bugs out and hamstrings the front-runner. All games tend toward every player colluding to ensure a swift end to the experience. How can anyone love such an RNG heavy, tedious piece of garbage. Even if you want a long-form RPG-style board game experience (and why would you) there are so  many better ones.\n\nBuy this game if you are a masochist.

It's a board game on a computer, which is perfectly legitimate.\n\nBut how does it stack up as a board game? Even there its basic design fails.\n\nDon't get me wrong. There are some great things about this board game, especially the replayability and variety of interesting scenarios (for a board game), if you're willing to fork over money for a lot of DLC. However, where the game fundamentally fails in two areas:\n\n1) You have very little ability to control where your character goes and what it does, which means you can spend long portions of the game just wondering around, rolling dice and seeing what happens (or doesn't happen, as the case may be). This makes the game very luck based, but worse than that, it becomes pretty tedious, especially when the board becomes filled with cards that effectively don't do anything.\n\n2) It's really hard to end the game; partially because the game requires you luck out on a series of dice rolls just to get to the point where the game starts to end; partially because the game doesn't really penalize you at all for trying to power up indefinitely before heading to the end game; and partially because the first character to get to the end of the game gets the dubious honor of being forced to sit there doing nothing but rolling one die to see if maybe they'll do 1 point of damage to the other characters.\n\nWith some of the above problems fixed, Talisman could become a fun board game/computer game, but as it is, you spend most of your time waiting for your turn in the hope that you'll get to do something interesting.","April 20, 2015","false","13.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Compared to Talisman: Prologue, I would say just buy whichever is on sale. Both have slow interfaces and annoying control methods. The actual board game is legendarily slow to play and these two games take the physical slowness out of the equation, but insert slowness and clunky controls where you feel like virtuality would lend itself to smoothness.\nSometimes you need to click the board to do a thing and the game will interpret your click as something else, and you'll mess up your turn. Sometimes the game's controls will screw you. All I can recommend is to be as careful as you can.\nIf you're a big fan of Talisman but you don't have friends who want to play the game on Steam with you, just buy the real board game.

The worst part about it is  the inconsistency. There are actually times where your turn is finished for you, even if the timer doesn't run out. Another issue there: there's a mandatory timer!

Once you get to the center you're stuck rolling until you get booted or you kill everyone. Meanwhile, the AI jerked around in the outer ring of tiles healing up at least as must damage I was dealing from the crown.\n\nWhile sitting through this mind-numbing experience I found that you can set "house rules" to end the game when someone reaches the crown, or to stop healing when someone is at the crown, but the fact that there are such glaring design flaws in the base game is pretty unforgivable.","July 19, 2015","false","3.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

SOMETIMES, you can resume game (which is a cool feature) but othertimes it just will not work. It gets really funky. Now, to me, there is nothing worse than spending 2.5 hours on a game with 3 other people and right as it's getting good the multiplayer takes a dump all over and we can't finish the game. The support is also non-existant (thanks Nomad) so don't believe this will change any time soon, but if enough people are buying and playing maybe that will change (I highly doubt it.

Once you get to the center you're stuck rolling until you get booted or you kill everyone. Meanwhile, the AI jerked around in the outer ring of tiles healing up at least as must damage I was dealing from the crown.\n\nWhile sitting through this mind-numbing experience I found that you can set "house rules" to end the game when someone reaches the crown, or to stop healing when someone is at the crown, but the fact that there are such glaring design flaws in the base game is pretty unforgivable.","July 19, 2015","false","3.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Truly one of the best board to digital game i've ever had the opportunity to play. The add-ons are completely worth it as well.  Now for the bad news. There have been multiple instances when playing with my group of friends where someone or multiple people will drop connection. SOMETIMES, you can resume game (which is a cool feature) but othertimes it just will not work. It gets really funky. Now, to me, there is nothing worse than spending 2.5 hours on a game with 3 other people and right as it's getting good the multiplayer takes a dump all over and we can't finish the game. The support is also non-existant (thanks Nomad) so don't believe this will change any time soon, but if enough people are buying and playing maybe that will change (I highly doubt it. Wishful thinking maybe).

Talisman is a massive game in its "analog form" and with all of the expansions and four players, the setup is considerable and games can be marathons. But that's all good as boardgamers expect that. That said, Talisman Digital Edition fots nicely on my PC, requires mere minutes at most of setup an most importantly, captures the sheer fun of Talisman, Isn't that why we play games, for fun?\n\nA few negative reviews commented on the woeful AI. But, perhaps these folk are playing the prelude titled Talisman: Prologue. I have found the AI to be pretty good. And let's not forget that Talisman is largely a luck based game. All of the so-called tactics I have seen and heard about the game must still bow to the capriciousness of the deity known as RNG; even an AI like Deep Blue cannot predict the vagaries of dice rolls.\n\nThere are a few issues that linger. One of the most annoying is when an AI opponent draws an event card. Unless you are a speed reader or you know every Talisman card by rote - and with all of the expansions in the physical boardgame there is an insane number of cards, you won't have time to read what the event is. You have to zoom in on the board section where the event is. The same holds true for other non-spell cards. This has been brought up to the devs but as yet there has been no fix for this.\n\nThe digital version allows you to earn runes which grant advatages in gameplay. [AI also collects these as well]. I like the mechanic as it lends a sort of leveling up feeling.\n\nThe Dungeon Expansion is next up and I cannot wait for its release! If it is as faithful as the physical version of the game, it's going to be a blast.\n\nI think that Talisman Digital Edition is a wonderful introduction to the fun world of tabletop boardgaming and it scratches the itch of tabletop boardgamers who want to play without the crazy setup and rather forced solo variants for the physical game found round the interwebz.\n\nThis is a STEAL at the price and I would advise buyers to spend a little extra dosh and get The Reaper and Frostmarch expansions as they add considerably to the game.\n\nI hope that more boardgames experience a digital conversion. Are you listening Games Workshop and Fantasy Flight?\n\nEDIT: 18 November. The Dungeon expansion really ramps this game up considerably. The AI can be quite nasty and that's good as Talisman is a cut throat game.\n\nI am hopeful that the devs will release Blood Moon and The Dragon next. These two expansions literally change the game, adding a bit more unpredictability to a game that can punch you in the face already and have you smiling about it.\n\nUPDATE January 15: Ya gota love this developer. With the latest update there are two new free characters. These two are not even present in the physical boardgame but were last seen in the 1986(!) version of Talisman. More achievements plus what seems to be a hint that the Highland expansion is next!

I immediately liked the game.  This Talisman: DE is a digital Board game, literally.  You play as a variety of classes trying to buff your stats and make it to the center of the board before anyone else gets there.  The game relies heavily on RNG type randomness, Most actions involve dice rolls, and most "encounters" rely on the way the deck is "shuffled".  Another thing to note, I don't know if I'm just unlucky, but this game is long, I have been in the same game for about 4 hours now. no one has come very close to winning yet. I don't know how long the average game against the ai lasts, but mine are always terribly long.\n\nOverall though I like the gameplay and art a lot. The art reminds me of classic Dungeons and Dragons art, and less grimdark games workshop art. I recommend this to anyone still interested after all that. I dont know  what kind of player will like it most really. If you get it, I hope you have fun!","April 3, 2015","true","11.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

At that time it had a huge number of bugs and other problems, particularly with multiplayer, but those have been entirely rectified.  This is a fantastic adaptation of a great board game.  It takes a long time to play, especially with a lot of players; less time than the actual board game though since you don't have to bother with setting it up or putting it away.  The game itself is quite a lot of fun for any RPG and board game lover.  It's a great value too, especially if you pick it up on sale (and it goes on sale fairly frequently).

I still own 2 versions of the original board game which I have played countless times.  As such I can confirm the game rules are superbly accurate to the original, making this game a must for all Talisman fans.\nOn occasion, it can be difficult to use an ability or specific card during your turn (within the time limit given) as the game will not remind or encourage you to check your inventory lists, so you need to pay attention.\nThis is a rare occurance, however, dependant on character chosen rather than any particular oversight due to the game design.  There are plenty of new characters to purchase as well as three of the original six expansion packs already released.  Dice roll for me is depressingly unlucky (just as it always was for my board games) so i find the gameplay quite difficult.  Animations are colourful and the addition of runestones and customisable rules keeps the game interesting. You can even save your progress on multiple games and come back to them when you want.\nI highly recommend this game already and will love it even more when the Timescape expansion is added.","January 29","true","15.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Without the expansion content enabled, it's a much more straightforward and less interesting experience.  The UI could also benefit from some adjustments, as it's sometimes difficult to click spells before the game moves past the point where they're legal to play, and at times you're forced to make a decision without the ability to click around to examine details of the game state... issues which can both be largely mitigated by familiarity and careful attentiveness, but which will hopefully be remedied in the future.\n\nAll of this together makes for a game that's a lot of fun with a bit of investment, but which does not make a good first impression.

Love it!\n\nI'm a board game/TTRPG junkie (multi-time Gen Con attendee). There's a ton of content here, and the game is fun and challenging at the same time. It's nice to be able to just jump into the digital edition without setup, and even with some AI that's not TOO bad. It does make a few boneheaded mistakes though.\n\nFor instance I usually play with random characters against 3 AI. I had the Troll. I killed one of the other characters and forgot to loot ALL the items (my own fault, hit the button to quick) and the Devil's Minion CPU player swooped in and grabbed it all including the follower that reduces the Peril of Plane's requirements by 1 die. OMG.\n\nThe Devil's Minion made to the the Crown of Command, because he made it there so early he only had 5 STR and 6 CRA. I got EXTREMELY lucky and grabbed the poltergiest as a follower on the right side of the outer region of the board. Along there was "The healer with 2 free heals " (thankfully I got turned to Good along the way!) and "The Shrine", next to them was the Forest. So since I could only move one space it was great that I could keep moving back and forth between these spaces healing myself and trying to bump up my craft at the Forest. I also had spells of one Counterspell, one Random, and one Temporal Warp. I was going to use the Temporal Warp when I finally started making my run to the Crown! I made a huge mistake by going into the Village and not realizing it ditched the Poltergiest! OH NO!\n\nSince I had 10 STR and 5 CRA, I decided to make a run for it. The Devil's Minion rolled BADLY on quite a few Crown spells. I luckily made my way all the way to the Crown with 11 STR from figting one monster along the way and cashing some in.\n\nSo the Devil's Minion had 5 lives, I had 4. But I definitely had the upper hand from a mathematical standpoint. So what does the Devil's Minion do when he fights me, he picks STR!! WHAT IN THE. I was afraid it was going to be a race to 0 to see who could roll luck (he COULDN'T beat me in STR 11 vs 5, but he had a chance in CRA 5 vs 6). So I whittled him down to 1 health, and THEN he finally lets loose with a CRA attack and actually wins. I beat him the next turn.\n\nThis is what I mean by the AI makes some poor decisions. What should have been a nail-biter, ended up being a big WHA? What is he doing?!\n\nStill love the game!!","September 12, 2015","true","36.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is a very faitfull adaptation, and the expansions have never been more accessible. They are doing hot-seat right with regard to hidden cards. And a great set of houserules avaliable. If you are not familiar with talisman, it is a very laid-back game where the focus is more on experiencing stuff than actually making any big decissions that matter. This newer version include a faith point system that older versions didn't have, that somewhat alievates the otherwise a bit "snakes and ladders" feel the game might get when you are used to it. So recomended if you want a easy somewhat competitative game with fantasy theme (the theme is strong with this one). If you want more challenging decissionmaking there are probably better options.","July 15, 2015","true","11.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So much fun to level up your character, gaining strength and craft to fight enemies with. The object of the game is to reach "the crown of command" in the center of the board. However this is not so simple. You will have to go on different quests throughout the game to gain an object known as a "Talisman" to get the various places on the board. You will need one as you travel from the middle region of the board to the center region. However many things could happen between getting one and getting through to the center region. A player could fight you and kill you. A witch, bear or demon could spawn on you and destroy powerful or useful items you're carrying. The worst? Being turned into a toad. This is where all your items are dropped in the space you have turned into the toad. While playing as a toad, other players can pick up your items. It's a very challenging game and extremely time consuming. The 8 hours i have played.. 6 of them is just one full game of talisman, where unfortunately i did not win! I have the actual board game too and the digital version helped me learn it better as it gives you tutorials on your playthrough. Of course these can be turned off! If you are a fan of fantasy, board games and strategy then this one is definately for you! For what it is, i give it an 8/10. The game itself is excellent, but as i say you need a LOT of time spare if you're wanting to finish a game!","July 10, 2015","true","11.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This can be reduced by changing the game options.\n\nBe warned, this game contains:\n- My average game length is 1-2 hours, but it can be much longer.\n- Devastating random events. A single die roll MAY (and will) destroy you.\n- Horribly broken AI (which gives you a fighting chance of victory).\n- Waiting on AI turns (sometimes their turns are longer than your own).\n- Predetermined dice rolls (no restarting to cheat against the AI).\n- Lots of "Confirm" buttons when several could be replaced by having an "undo" button instead.\n- No "auto play" option for times when there is no choice involved.\n- Massive amounts of pay DLC.\n\nI recommend it, but its certainly not for everyone!","July 6, 2015","true","11.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
