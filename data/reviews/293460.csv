Imagine something like Zombie Shooter mixed with Project Zomboid in a way. You move around a city, collecting quests and loot and you're surviving against the undead. I've come across 8 different types as well as bosses [which actually feel like bosses].  The loot system is great [imagine Diablo with more of a weapon variety including  Handguns and Shotguns] and I'm liking the chracter progression [level up and you choose the equivalent of perks to add to your skill-set]. There's also a noise system in the sense that if you fire a gun, they all know where to come to munch on you. You can stealth around them but the loss of XP is just too much for me to do that.\nThere's things I'd like to see though. Possibly some character creation or at least some customization with different armour/gear sets.\nI also think this would be insanely good as a co-op/Multi-player game.\n\nThere's no many bugs as of yet. I've seen enemies clip through terrain and even get stuck within walls but nothing game-breaking as of yet. Also some of the animations are really clunky [especially the attack animations] and I've also found that when I go onto the screen to create a profile and then back out, the interface crashes and I have to restart.\n\nAll in all, I think this is a pretty solid alpha and I can see this being quite good with some work. I'm looking forward to the updates ^_^","May 9, 2014","true","4.0"," 57 of 67 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","57","67","0","0"

Basically, it is a third person action, with 3 levels zoom in and out.\n2) The game is pausable real-time.  This allows you to pause the game at any time to check your inventory, your map, quest logs, Infected Monster Entries, Journal entries for tips on how to play or books you read or dialogs you have had which are recorded.  You can review your Character Page  with Attributes and derived skills, Your Doctrines aka Training etc.\n3) Now Imagine that the game also includes a vast action RPG system that is similar to Fallout 1 and 2 or Arcanum's system but for this WW2 meets the Infected Apocalypse setting in NYC.\n4) You increase your attributes  like Strength or Accuracy and your derived skills such as Unarmed or Rifle skill through USAGE of that skill.   Want to shoot pistols better, shoot them a lot.  This will improve things such as Pistol skill and likewise related attribute of accuracy.  It is all clearly explained with all the detail you need by browsing the various menus either via mouseovers while paused or a click on something for more info.  Also explained in a narrative form in the Journal of C.J.  that is provided in-game.\n\nSo what you have is an action RPG with the depth of Fallout Series with the perspective and look of Nation Red creating a deep game that feels much like a Post Apocalyptic Zombie Story.   It's a bit like Dead Island/Diablo/Baldur's Gate with a skill system that feels like Arcanum/Fallout.   If that doesn't sound interesting to you, well I don't know what will.\n\nNow, there are all sorts of loot as well in this game.  Sure you have the usual clubs, pistols, revolvers, shotguns, submachineguns, machine guns, flamethrowers, grenades, placeable mines, flares, carbines, rifles of WW2 type vintage but also each may have one to several modifications on it when it is found.   In addition, you may find enhancement modification kits for them, then you can also enhance things with serum etc.   It's as if Titan Quest or Diablo mods had gone WW2 on you, and runes had become kits.   In other words, it's fun to explore and fight if only for loot.   Areas eventually do respawn, the longer you are away from a map, the more likely and numerous the respawns.   Meanwhile you have quests, safe areas that act as towns in fantasy rpgs, etc.\n\nBalance is really well achieved.  The currency is serum.   Serum allows you to nullify for a time the bad effects of infection,  but it does not cure it.   Each time you take serum you will need more vials of it to push back the raging infection in you.  Infection levels have detrimental effects and full infection leads to death.   So serum is precious.   You can sell and buy for serum.   There are also scraps.  Scraps allow you to repair items yourself, but you can also pay repairers to repair with serum or purchase or find repair kits.   Likewise for infection you may find Infection Kits, but those are more rare.   As mentioned, there are also Enhancement Kits as part of loot, these modify weapons with certain requirements and a scraps requirement, but then they act like runes in Diablo enhancing your current weapons by simply dragging the Enhancement Kit onto the qualified weapon.   Loot therefore is precious in a multitude of ways and can serve many needs.  Sell for serum as currency or to fight off your infection.   Get serum by killing infected aka mutants/zombies all of which may have different mutations and traits as well as basic traits due to type  of mutant, and there are many base types already.   Batteries keep your flashlight juiced, and it can get very dark.   Want to stay fresh, then don't get Tired or Fatigued by staying near campfires (barrels with fire to heat you up), or get into a fully covered building and get out of the elements for even quicker recovery.   Any type of fatigue, stamina effect to aiming etc, it's all in there.   It's all something to consider.   Need more scraps, break down a weapon and scavenge its scraps to fix another you prefer, or if you can get to a trader perhaps you prefer to sell it for serum, then use the serum to pay the trader to repair the weapon -- but then don't expect your Mechanical skill for repair to raise as well.  Decisions, decisions.\n\nAgain, you raise skills and related attributes by USAGE.   You TRAIN in DOCTRINES to enhance related abilities in those skillsets and attributes, which you qualify for by meeting certain attribute and skill combinations.   It seems at first a little confusing, but just remember -- if you USE the weapons or RUN AROUND a lot, you will expect to soon be able to train related Doctrines, while also improving your related skills and attributes.    It's more Skyrim than Oblivion.   What you do alot creates your effective class, but there are no classes per se -- it all depends on how you play that character.\n\nDifferent weapons have different base ranges and attack speed, they have different durability, etc.  It's all there as you would expect, want, and hope.\n\nBesides the Campaign mode, there is the Prologue which serves as a Tutorial, and there is Survival Mode.   I have to say I enjoy Survival Mode a great deal as well.   It's basically Nation Red with the above described random loot and skill development.   Want to simply fight an RPG arcade mode fighting wave after wave ... I used to call this Hassle-Mode, but the beauty of it is there is no hassle RPGing ... you simply don't worry about the story but otherwise it's Nation Red with RPG and loot.  So quick action fun is there and you also get to explore quickly the various doctrines and styles of play.\n\nOk, so the game is definitely at the level of most Betas -- it is playable and enjoyable, more polished than most, but it still has some minor bugs and is undergoing a lot of polish and development.   It was fun already back in September.   It's only better now and getting better.\n\nWhat are the biggest weaknesses?   Well, the main character may seem a bit drab looking, the rest looks good.   It plays fast even on medium/high settings of a mere Intel HD 2500 gpu ... yes that's right, your heard me right.  NO FRAMERATE ISSUES on that or better, period.   The range of view is a bit claustrophobic, but it makes exploring very exciting.   Most weapons are simply expected to be used within 20 meters or less -- often within 10 meters.   But that makes it more Diablo 2 like and adds to the chance of being surrounded, so you have to stay aware tactically.   Music is good, gameplay is addictive.   Combat is not quite as visceral with impact as Nation Red, but there is a ton more variety to what you experience.  I suppose it might be described as Fallout Tactics meets Nation Red with a story to boot.\n\nHighly recommended especially given the sales prices such as during this 2014 Steam Winter Sale.  The game is going to take at least 35 plus hours to complete one time, but you can play it so many ways and then there is survival mode.   Finally, this is a newish developer trying to make a larger, unique, breakout game for the company.   They are very involved on the forums, knowledgeable, caring, and quick to answer often in a few hours, but always in a couple of days if they can.   They also seem very organized and thoughtful in what they have tried to do.  They don't seem to fall behind schedule.   Perhaps some of you, like me, remember the frequent missteps of companies like Troika.   They made great games at least in terms of the many systems and concepts, but they constantly fell behind the contracted deadlines.  The reason was they could not accurately estimate how much time the various concepts would take to implement and when to stop adding features -- publisher/money issues or not.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Penworth09/recommended/293460/","Penworth09","Penworth09","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Penworth09/","154 products in account",""I Shall Remain" is a wonderful ARPG that has nifty and fun features which remind me of Dungeon Siege 1 and 2.\nTL;DR: I recommend you buy it.\n\nNow, for a slightly in depth review, I'll do the cons first:\n\nCONS:\n*The story's more of "tell don't show," character wise, with the protoganist literally saying what he's feeling and thinking about at the moment, but that's a slight complaint.\n* Early-game is hard, but that should be manageable once you find a way to get more serum.\n\nPROS:\n* The doctrine system and Dungeon Siege like character development. I think more ARPGs should follow this format. Your character progresses by using a weapon. Using a shotgun increases your skill for that, which in turn increases your rifle skill and in turn increases agility.  Once you level up, you gain a "doctrine," which are essentially skill trees which help you customize your character even further, as well as research points for further specialities. You can build your character to be a leader with buffed NPCs, or a solo rifle wielding killing-machine.  The system is fun because it feels natural...why would I ever put my hard-earned points into small arms when you've been killing enemies with your trusty winchester shotgun?\n* New spin on post-apocalyptic games: When you think "post apocalyptic," you think of Fallout, right? Past a future time with robots and computers? Well, this game takes place in the 1940s, sometime after WW2, and things have gone terribly, terribly wrong. Its a cool and novel way of looking at an old trope.\n* Serum: You're also infected. Which means you have to kill zombies to gain their zombie blood, from which the serum's derived. BUT the main currency in the game is serum. So there's a tight balance between getting skill points (by selling serum) to keeping some in stock for you to use before you become too infected that you can't fight anymore. It's a tight balance that keeps you on edge.\n\nBottomline: Game is Fun, pay and play as soon as you get the CashMoney for it.","August 27, 2015","true","8.6"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","22","25","2","0"

I thought it will be just another fun action Diablo-ish version of a game set in a post apocalyptic setting. Boy was I wrong!  I found beneath all of this a very complex RPG system. With a lot of statistics, skills, doctrines and a very interesting game play. I love the play style of older games like Gothic, Fallout or Baldur’s Gate where you are rewarded for exploring. In I shall Remain this is wonderfully done by balancing this exploration feeling with the treasures and dangers of the unknown world. It always feels like an adventure to explore some new building or new map never knowing what you may encounter.  Also the great ambiance and atmosphere provided by the music and art style augment this feeling.  I also like the mechanics in the game, the scavenge, night-day, stamina and infested state are greatly enhancing the atmosphere and are very well integrated in the story and the survival feeling that you have when playing.  I’m having a blast with this game so far and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good thrill but also for those searching for a game with a little more depth!","May 12, 2014","true","2.3"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","0"

The gameplay is somewhat similar to State of Decay, minus vehicles, but actually smoother and more polished in this "alpha" state. Also there is an interesting twist in that your protagonist is infected and periodically needs serum to control the disease. The graphics are very nice.

Oak's Quick Look video at the bottom of this review.\n\nThis game is a great example of Early Access games. Low price point. Very playable game. Plenty of content. Clear vision. Thoughtful dev team.\n\nMost important factor: The game is fun and the mechanics are smooth. It’s not easy to combine multiple genres of games and come out with something that is isn’t confusing to the senses. I didn’t feel like I was playing a roguelike one minute, an RPG the next, a Strategy the next, an Adventure the next and an ARPG the next. Each time the mode of the gameplay changed ever so slightly, it was always appropriate to the situation in the game. Because of this, the game moved along fluently and without breaking immersion. The story held tight as a result.\n\nStrong points of the game that made me enjoy my time:\n\n•	It’s a survival game with varying loot drops, like common, uncommon, etc. Those who are loot mongers like me and enjoy the loot variations of Diablo, Borderlands and Zigfrak will enjoy that fact immensely.\n•	The camera swings easily, the shots are true, and the interaction is spot-on.\n•	Great atmosphere from the wonderfully-appropriate music and sound effects right down to the creepy shadows that hide zombies and dirty look of the screen (which is indeed adjustable to your liking by the way). When you’re outside, it feels like it. When you are inside, the confinement adds to the claustrophobic life or death situation you are in.\n•	The gun reticule is appropriate to the gun you are using. If you’re using a pistol, the reticule is closer to your character; use a rifle and you get a longer aiming reticule and better accuracy. A great way to simulate aim difference in a top-down game.\n•	You can go it alone or bring in survivors to your fold and form a squad. You can then interact with the survivors in your squad much like Baldur’s Gate, Might and Magic, etc., by transferring items, sharing the carry load, specializing each member in ranged or melee, completely separate skill trees and so on. I highly suggest creating a squad. It really adds to the game play.\n•	An intense and well-written story that is gritty, but not too over-the-top set just after WW2 in New York. You consistently have a sense of purpose in the game. I was very surprised by the research the dev team put into character names. One such name is described in my Quick Look vid.\n•	There isn’t a CHANCE that you will get infected. You ARE infected and have to manage that by gathering a serum to keep your infection at bay. This same serum is used as currency to barter with NPCs for upgrades and supplies. There are consequences to your actions here.\n•	I can’t fall down open sewer grates to my death. The character stops at the edge. +1\n•	You are rewarded for exploring. I went off the beaten path a few times and was rewarded with a loot container. When you loot a container or object, there is a chance you will fail. There is a progress bar that counts down as you hold your spacebar to simulate time taken to loot. If you fail your attempt, you may loot again, but it takes longer each time afterward. This really adds to the “Oh Crap” factor when zombies are nearby. Loved it.\n•	When you are outside, you start incurring a tiredness penalty. The more tired you are, the slower your health and stamina regenerates. Nice touch. You can rest up in clearly marked buildings on the map (and mini-map) by going inside and getting out of the weather.\n•	There are varying mobs. Such as common, elite, boss, etc. Each tougher mob drops appropriate loot. And, you have a proficiency level in your stats that gives you a BONUS when killing each mob type after you have leveled up your kill count with that particular mob. Very, very cool.\n\nThere are more, but some are surprises that I don’t want to spoil.\n\nWhat I didn’t like about the game:\n\nThe fact that the text sometimes auto-scrolls and I missed some of the story. I was quickly contacted by the dev after my review vid and told that I could have just paused the game. Very true and that wiped out the only thing I didn’t like.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a survival experience with good atmosphere, story and mechanics. This game is well put together. Here’s the kicker: At the time of this review, it was still in Early Access. Very impressive and very exciting for us. :) I can’t wait to see what the future holds for this game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLYnFzq97WM&list=UUb8-Xfh-YYjBhRtvEaJBZsA","November 19, 2014","true","4.8"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

First, the atmosphere is superb. At times desolate and claustrophobic, the levels demonstrate a nice variety with logical obstacles rather than invisible walls, and the sepia option (which is adjustable) adds to the period feel. Special mention should be made of the score: though at the moment the tracks are limited, the music is somber and beautiful.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, ISR includes RPG elements and a degree of character customization where your levels increase based in part on what weapons you favor or activities you perform. You can find, learn or purchase additional skills for further specialization. While each NPC teammate specializes in a particular skill or weapon class their specific attributes (endurance, strength, accuracy, weapons proficiency, healing, etc) can be developed as the player chooses.\n\nCombat features an impressive variety of enemies, each susceptible or resistant to certain types of weapons. In addition to firearms and melee weapons you can use grenades, landmines or exploding barrels to effect more strategic kills. There is a significant survival aspect involved as well, since in addition to health you must also manage three factors: tiredness, stamina and infection. If these are neglected for too long running, wielding heavy weapons and environmental factors such as cold and rain will slowly reduce your efficiency in combat and ability to regenerate health and stamina. "Infection" measures the amount of virus in your bloodstream (which increased with time or from attacks by certain enemies) and can eventually result in death. This is mitigated by the use of serum derived from zombies, which provides rare justification for whaling on infectious post-humans with a piece of wood.\n\nUnusually, though the game does feature weapons durability it also allows you the option to break other weapons for parts. These parts can in turn be used to repair or reinforce higher-level weapons, which can be further enhanced with serum to increase the efficacy. Also there are flamethrowers.\n\nAs of mid-November of 2014 the only major issue is that the Survive! option, where one has a limited amount of time to prepare for zombie attacks before trying to survive the night, is prone to crashing. However, the developers are extremely active and this problem is being worked on.\n\nThis is an interesting little game with a lot of promise and a slowly unraveling story that, though clearly demonstrating the stresses of surviving in a post-apocalyptic world right on the heels of WWII, tends towards a somewhat more optimistic and cooperative view of human nature than the typical spate of Walking Dead/28 Days Later-type fare. While it has a ways to go, fans of the genre and those who appreciate the ability to shape their character to suit their playstyle should check it out.\n\n","November 24, 2014","true","88.9"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

Only in this universe, the Nazis managed to unleash a deadly virus over US territory.  As a survivor, your goal will be to fight zombies, scavenge, gather allies...you know, all the stuff you'd expect to do during a zombie apocalypse.  It has a lot going for it, what with character progression, inventory management, quests, and an economy that stresses the serum you'll need to keep from turning yourself.  While the game is still under development and has some bugs, it's thoroughly enjoyable as-is (motion blur is my biggest complaint as there's no option to turn it off). I can safely recommend this one, especially if you enjoy survival games and ARPGs.\n\nUPDATE: A dev informed me that you can disable motion blur by setting "post processing" to "medium".

Another amazing aspect worth mentioning is the day and light cycle and the weather changing system that it also affects the mood of the characters.

Fun story, fun to play. The only problems I have come accross is the hand to hand and melee fighting is a little buggy. Could just be my computer, but I don't think it is. With a few small fixes here and there this will be a great game. Definatly worth the price to play the Beta/Alpha test, whatever it is at now. Besides the small fighting issues, I am not sure I could ever collect enough serum to get my "infection" down, it is/has been full up and now I need 10 serums just to drop the 20-25% you get for a shot. I fully intend to keep trying and I am enjoying it greatly. Highly recommended to any who like action-rpg type games wether you are into zombies or not, as I am mostly not.\nCan't wait to see how the finished product rolls though.\n\nI want to make sure I add that every issue I have had has been fixed. As well as the infection/serum thing was just because I was early on in the game. When I play now I can easily keep the infection down. Rookie me thinking I would never get enough serum.

It's getting dark, you're tired and you're down to your last couple of flashlight batteries. You have to go on, you need the blood for the serum and you need the serum to hold off the pain...\n\n30 rounds in the SMG are not enough! You're not used to it, but today you're going to fire your shotgun too. These new guys are bigger and the SMG is too light for them. Ah... the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ flashlight is flickering again!\n\nGameplay\n\nI Shall Remain is all about the alternative history "zombie apocalypse" type atmosphere and the ongoing pressure of survival. You have to get guns to kill infected, you have to kill infected to get serum, you have to get serum to keep your infection under control, you have to find safehouses to rest, you have to kill infected to empty the safehouses... Constantly you have to be on your toes, to use all your resources, to even run away if necessary!\n\nCharacter development is skill based and depends on your weapon choice. Your weapon choice depends on the "luck of the drop" mainly and you also have to adapt to the enemy types, because they have different resistances and you can't afford wasting bullets that only deal half damage. On the other hand, if you use weapons that you are not used to, your chance to hit drops, so you may be firing bullets that deal no damage. The game makes you pay attention to these kind of decisions and sometimes you have to make them on the fly, because encounters tend to be unexpected and in high numbers.\nOther than that, you get "doctrines"(which work like passive bonuses) for every level. Some doctrines are skill specific and you can buy them with research points.\n\nInventory management is easy; your main concern is to have a mixed collection of weapons and sufficient parts to repair them. Some batteries, juice and medkits are also necessary, but nothing tedious is going to keep you away from the action.\n\nThe flow of the game is exactly as detailed in the intro. You always have to keep an eye on your tiredness, infection level, serum, ammunition, flashlight battery, health and stamina. You have to keep going and you have to find time to rest. You get to interact with the world and the story through written dialogue and sometimes you even get to team up with some of the survivors. The AI is decent and the story, even though it needs retouching, here and there, helps the atmosphere.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics are not mindblowing, but they do what they are supposed to. The "infected" models are varied, the weather effects are beautiful and the GUI does its job. The environment really sets the tone, you'll find yourself in damaged homes,  broken down hospitals, streets full of vintage crashed cars and blood smears. The lightning effects are quite nice, a lightning strike during nighttime that reveals a couple of hungry "infected" walking toward you is always a thrill.\n\nSounds\n\nWalking on the streets, fighting for your life is complemented by a smooth soundtrack. The weapon sounds are okay, as well as the sounds the enemies make. Especially in the sewers, things can get pretty scary. Some speech would've been nice, but it's only early access, so who knows?\n\nConclusion\n\nThe game has an old school single player experience feel to it, it greets the player with great atmosphere, has a good story, meaningful quests, interesting character development and leveling system and good level design. All in all "I Shall Remain" is a good game, with lots of potential to paint a compelling "alternative history" picture.","May 18, 2014","true","1.7"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","1"

It did take a short while for me to get used to the game control and mechanics, but then it grew on me rather quickly as it has a lot of old-school charm i haven't felt since staying awake nights as a teenager exploring the dungeons of diablo 1.\n\nNow to review the main parts of the game:\n-The loot system is well done and ballanced as it gives you enough ammo to shoot at zombies, but never more than it takes to make you feel that ammo is in short supply and not to be wasted (actually the best parts of the game for me was when i was very low on ammo and had to make each shot count).\n\n-The skill system is the best part of the game for me, there are the main weapon categories each with their bonuses (doctrines) as you progress, wich are well thought out and fit each weapon type, giving it a different play-style. On top of that there are books spread through the game that give you extra bonuses to skills that are not accessible through leveling them up via experience, so finding these thoughout the game is really rewarding.\nThere are also some minor negatives here, like the shotgun and sniper rifle being in one category and sharing some bonuses and  enemy resistances that don't make a lot of sense intuitively, but it's by no means something game-breaking.\n\n-The replayability factor is suprisingly high for a game with a more or less liniar structure in the levels available so far. Having tried out different builds (melee and heavy weapons are by far my favourite) they play and feel different enough to make it rewarding to replay the game over and over trying different things. On top of that the randomized loot also adds a lot to the replayability factor , and a good drop actually means something in a game that doesn't spam you with loot ala diablo 2.\n\n-The visuals are very fitting for the game , adding to the nostalgia feel it has going for it. It is still rather rough around the edges (the animations are pretty lacking at the moment) but there are a lot of things to be still added to that aspect that should make the game really shine. In the couple of months i have worked with the team the game has improved noticably in the visual department and if they keep it up they will have a real polished product by the end of development\n\nTo sum it up the game is not without flaws currently, but it has a lot of heart and potential, and is a welcome addition to the RPG genre bringing back some old-school gameplay and mechanics in a good way. Keep at it :)\n","May 12, 2014","true","1.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

I don't know - maybe it would bloom at the late game, but this far game feels highly unfinshed - more like a beta test, where testers have to pay to test the game.\n\nThe game is not without positive points - but this far - I've found 2 of them:\n- Advancement system, based on 'you are what you use' and unlocking 'perks' that further shape you into desired hero, which is both nice and annoying (because you can't save some points and invest them into firing rifles, for example, all of a sudden - you need to tediously go from missing every second shot to being able to hit zombie into eye from great distance)\n- Setting - most of zombie games happen in modern/futuristic settings and there are not many WW2 zombie games.\n\nBut negative points are plenty:\n- Graphics - that's my first problem. And it's not a bad quality of models or textures or anything - it's a very wrong composition of them and lighting - during my game play most of time - I've controlled brown/black (no racial offense - I mean color of his clothes) character, who was running across brown/black land killing brown/black zombies. Sometimes I couldn't see my character in that mess. Quite often I couldn't see enemies. And flashlight doesn't help much. And to add to all that - after they are killed common enemies dissipate into red mist which obscures your vision even more. If developers were aiming for 'noir' type of style - adding 'brown' to the pallette was wrong - it makes you feel swimming through some sewage. Update: Thanks to developer's reply - I found out that there is 'aging' affect in options that makes things more brown. So, turning it off helps somewhat and returns colors to the game. Stil - other graphic problems stay - hard to spot enemies, hard to notice character (there are still moments when even without 'aging' character blends with back ground perfectly), blood mist into which dead enemy turn (imagine backing off from a horde of zombies, while shooting at them - and every shot enemy bursts into cloud of mist to cover its buddies). Also, found another problems - when your character gets covered by a wall - you can see his outline through it. But when enemy gets covered by one - there is no outline, even if the enemy is hitting your character.\n- Sound - or mostly lack of it. There are sounds of gunfire and background music mostly stays very quiet, aside from moments when it plays compositions 'cat jumped onto piano and we've decided to include it into soundtrack'. There is NO in-game voice, which brings you to another problem - sometimes character tell their thoughts/feelings/else, sometimes there is even a narative, but it's all (except some dialogues) made as a string at a bottom of the screen, which is hard to notice (most of the time you'd be focused on shooting things or looking at other parts of screen).\n- Level design - levels are a mess. In some games - there is a difference between one building and another - but here they are almost same. And maps are a mess as well - sometimes you see a passage on the map only to find out that it's blocked by something. And yes, things that block your passage add insult to the game - game tells you that you are a soldier, so you expect to be trained in things like jumping ot stepping over things... but, no. A couple of tires is an impassable object. Knee-high barier - also.\n\nSumarizing my opinion - the game HAS potential.  But in curent state - it's a mess that doesn't feel pleasant to play. If you really want it - try following it and see if it would change. After fidling with graphical setting - game stopped being unpleasant, but it's still clumsy. So, I still won't recommend and name it a risky purchase - but at least now I see why SOME people may like it. I'll try to update this review if there would be any significant changes in game or my opinion.","August 25, 2015","false","1.4"," 48 of 85 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","48","85","4","22"

If you are looking for a diablo esque game with zombies and surival elements this is for you. You get to build a team as you slowly find the people in the city and do missions or save their lifeless body from the hoard to earn their trust. The rpg elements are minimalistic as in the skill progression is linear( not saying its a bad thing.) I'm just saying at this time in alpha skills only have 5 upgrade options for each path, so dont expect to have multiple classes right now since the progression is limited in that aspect and hopefully they will add more skill trees/ make different playable characters with different trees for skills. You will spend a majority of your time exploring the city and farming supplies to make it to the next mission.  The enemies seem pretty easy but in the options you can change the difficulty its easy-normal-hard-impossible in that order and there may be one more its late and my heads a bit fuzzy. For what i paid for the game it is very much worth it and if you are looking for a top down free roam with some rpg elements this game is for you. My only qualm with the game is that the camera seems uber clunky and could use some fine adjustment/tightening but other then that its pretty fun and straight forward.

The developers are very much involved in the forums and interact with the community, you can really tell the developers really care about the quality of the game.

No, but it is partly open world\nDoes this game have online co-op? No, but it is just early access and the devs have said that once they got most of the stuff for the single player out of the way, they may start work on an Online mode.\nDoes this game have ♥♥♥♥♥ devs who don't get along with those who buy their game? No they are really nice guys to know and guess what it's only 3 of them who work on ISR!\n\nI wouldn't let that fact it is not fully open world stop you from buying it, ISR is a very fun game, and the devs of it are some of the nicest guys ever. I've seen at lest one of them reply in every single discussion todate. Hell I even ended up in a nice little chat with them when I linked them a pic of my first version of the unique gun Unbreakable.\n\nAnd to add even more to how nice they are. Due to how active I am in their discussion and how helpful I've been with suggesting ideas for ISR they added recently have added or will be adding in the next update a unique Iron Pipe called Nightshade which they have said is based off one of my past steam names Nightshade (Don't believe me? Check out the discussion I started in the Suggestions and improvements secton of the ISR discussions) P.S they recently changed it to from a iron pipe to a flamethower\n\nAnother user I know called Steve Blanner also had this happen to him where the devs have added a unique small machine gun (more commenly know to us as SMGS) called Steve Blanner's Repeater. Which I have the link of Steve's gun within the game https://www.dropbox.com/s/ht4l208jw717fhh/Zombie01142015_133528849.jpg?dl=0\n\nAs for the gameplay? Well if you've come looking for bugs, this is not the place for you as I've not had any gamebreaking bugs that stop me from doing parts of the story, only the old one or two bugs that caused me to miss out on a item but nothing that stopped me from doing the story.\n\nThere is also a large choice of weapons to pick from and doing pretty much anything including walking and running can level you up.\n\nAs for the weapons don't expect anything like lazer guns or like a small lazer dagger as the game is set in WWII time so all the weapons will be WWII ones till the devs say otherwise (but we do have flamethowers and I think soon a WWII RPG)\n\nThe controls are easy to use and get used to, that I don't even see why you would want to ask for controller support for ISR as the game is pretty much made for keyboard and mouse.\n\nOh and unlike most devs the guys who work on ISR never just shoot your idea down the second you post it instead they say it may not fit well into the story or time of ISR but they never say they can't do it, hell sometimes they even think about your suggestion for the game and then come up with way they could add it to the game in a way that it would fit well into ISR\n\nThat is all I can say about the game (for now) but I will say this, you should really support this game and it's devs as they have my full support for 2 reasons.\n\n1: It's only 3 people working on this game which I find very fun to play\n\n2: As I've already said those 3 people working on this game are most nicest devs I've ever come across\n\nSo come on, what you waiting for? Support ISR as I for one want to see this game become a huge hit!\n\nAnd I forgot to add one last thing\n\nISR runs so smooth it looks like you're playing a game that isn't even in alpha or beta but as if its a already be released as a full working game already. I've never had so much fun playing a Early Access game before","January 14, 2015","true","25.5"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","10","15","2","3"

The biggest issues that have been brought up are already being adressed, THAT is how Early Access should work.\n\nAll in all, I am very much looking forward to the release and hope that ISR and respectively Scorpius Games get the attention they deserve.\nMy gut tells me they're going to finish this game 100%, no questions - and then probably pack another 15-20% on top of that, just because they're\n1) awesome\n2) convinced of their vision\n3) capable of pulling it off\n\nSo, if you came here looking for the game that would've been the outcome of "Diablo" and "Commandos" making a baby while "Hellgate London" was spying creepily through the keyhole, this is as close as you'll ever get to that!\n\n","July 8, 2015","true","14.1"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","14","23","4","1"

It is a steal for its price and is better than much more expensive games.  The ranged combat in this game is satisfying and the skill progression / development systems has allot of deph.  The downside is that there are some bugs, none I encountered were game breaking.  Thier customer support is awesome and the developers listen to what the players have to say.  The worse aspect of the game is the visuals.  Its really difficult to see what you are doing sometimes.  Trees completely cover up your character and enemies making it impossible to aim.  It is also very difficult to see at night but I think that was intended.  It makes sense that in a post apocalyptic world with not lights; eveything will be pitch black.  But even with a flashlight it is still very difficult to see.  You can use flares, to solve the problem but they are very limited.  Another problem I had is that you cannot buy ammo or explosives. You can only pick them up from scavaging or enemy kills. This makes character specialization in explosives imposssible and specialization in one gun type difficult.  You will need to pick several gun types in order have a steady supply of ammo.  Benifits from the type of guns you use are exclusive. If you use a different type the bonuses you bought with your skill points are deactivated.  The story is acceptable.  I found the music to be very good and fits the mood very well.  The whole game, especially in the beginning gives you a hopeless feeling, which is appropriate for a horror themed game.","August 29, 2015","true","48.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","3"

R. the day it released onto the early access program. I am a HUGE fan of top-down style games, after watching the trailers and doing some research I decided to take the risk and buy this EA title. I have had some crappy luck  with Steam's EA program (cough...Starforge).\nHonestly, it didn't take me long to fall in love with I S. R. and it's unique take on the top-down RPG style of games. Of course still being in Alpha there were some rough edges, but I always found it very playable and had very few crashes, even at such an early stage in development.  During I S.R.'s time in early access I've seen it improve patch after patch and month after month and of course there have always been regular content updates.\nThe devs are such an amazing group of guys/gals and are/should be an example of how to interact with the people who took the chance and supported you so early on.  I'm excited to see the game finally get released, I'm hoping that the game sells well so they can go on to make more games.\nI recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RPG's, open worlds, top-down shooters or supporting a good team of devs who have done a bang-up job with this game.","August 17, 2015","true","25.5"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

The game is slow, boring, and the visuals are muddy. I've had enemies teleport through walls. Explosions damage enemies behind walls. The visuals often obscure enemies and your player. The sound effects are laughable (even the token red barrels don't explode with any unf, or even real sound effects).  At least the soundtrack is kind of good?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLp7wIfWbfo","August 26, 2015","false","0.5"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","6","16","0","5"

It'll bring you right back down. This is seriously the most boring Action RPG I've ever played. So let's run this down:\n\nPros:\n+Gloomy, atmospheric environments.\n+Large selection of weapons (30+)\n+Expansive skill trees\n+It's another zombie game.\n\nCons:\n-It's ANOTHER zombie game!\n-Horrible framerate issues\n-Nauseating motion blur\n-Banal, unsatisfying combat\n-Artificially slow pace. Your character moves like a snail on horse tranquilizers, and scavenging takes more time than is necessary.\n-Shallow survival mechanics\n-Crosshair is NOT dynamic, and is at a fixed point in the interface, making mouse control feel unnatural and awkward.\n-Flat, boring SFX\n-DULL AS F***\n\nConclusion:\nThe slow pace combined with the horrible motion blur and dull combat led to the most boring ARPG experience in my life.

It might not be well known, but its well worth the price. It does seem rough around the edges but honestly the gameplay and content make up for any faults that small. Its a good action survival, everything is on short supply including batteries for the flashlight. Without the flashlight its nearly impossible to find your way around, or just surviving. I played a good amount of this game and was still no where near done.

No, just no. Path of Exile is like D3. This is nothing like it.\n\nVery poor controls. Horrible map setups with the painful noob developer mistake of using items you should be able to walk over as barricades. Very poor menus. Terrible collision detection. And on and on. If this was for sale for under 9$ I would say go ahead but the direction and poor contrsuction of basic game gui's shows this is just not worth the price.","April 18, 2015","false","0.8"," 15 of 39 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","15","39","0","0"
