I love the graphics, I love the theme (though I never read any of the novels) but as many here said, this game still needs A LOT of work.\n\nThe combat is unsatisfying, the ui reacts slowly if at all and the server ping is, for me staying between 100ms and 150ms, frustrating. Wich is the word I would use to describe my experience so far with this game. Behind everything you do, there are some little frustrations. Some due to the Early Access state of the game - wich I would be willing to wait out - and some I can already smell being fixable with real money. An example of the latter being that you fail a quest if you die wich means you have to abandon it and return to the questgiver to reaccept it. Wich is little more than an inconveinience but to me just feels like bait.\n\nSadly many little frustrations add up to one big one. Therefore I have to recommend to save your money at this point in time and just buy that fancy new Blizzard store mount you know you want.","October 4, 2015","false","3.5"," 204 of 222 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","204","222","2","0"

The reason I didn't get further is the game mostly did not work.\n\nI have been following this game on and off since 2008. Off mainly because I never received any emails about the game for seven years now (same email address). I figured the game had just ceased development. I noticed it on Steam recently and I guess they had some development issues and it changed hands. I thought I'd give it a try.\n\nFirst of all, I have a pretty decent setup:\n\nIntel i7-2600K, ASRock Extreme 77 motherboard\n32GB G-Skill 2566 MHz RAM\n500GB SSD\nZotac 6GB 980Ti Amp! Edition graphics\nBenq XL2420L 144Hz monitor\nWindows 7 64-bit Ultimate\n\nThe game is apparently capped at 60Hz, which is what it showed in most of the setup and tutorial areas, except when passing through the portal gate to get to the class testing areas. These don't even appear to be instances. All it seems to do is change your appearance for the class you're trying. FPS dropped to about 3-4 fps for several seconds.\n\nFirst I tried to change the key binds because I'm left-handed and always do in games. The key bind options did not work. They would appear to change when you selected them (except 'Left Ctrl', which exited the window) but they would not take and went back to the defaults when you closed the window (after pressing 'Apply'). So finally I decided to move on using the default keys. I faired no better.\n\nI went into the Warrior area first and I could use basic swing attackes by left-clicking mouse but none of the skills would reliably function. I occassionally got a couple to work but eventually they just stopped doing anything. I left that area and went to Marksman. My avatar did not change to Marksman but remained a Warrior, but I could not use the sword even. I left the area and came back, still a Warrior. After three or four times exitng and entering, I finally changed to a Marksman. None of the skills worked, not even the basic ones.\n\nI did not try the other classes because, by that time, I could see no point. I realized I was never going to play this. Now people may claim this is happening only to me and there must be a problem with my system, but I assure you there is not. I've played hundreds of games and have never found one I cannot play. After seven years of development, this game should be far beyond this point. I don't know how it got Greenlit.\n\nAnother thing that is odd in the design you may want to be prepared for: The VERY FIRST thing you must do in creation of a character is choose their name, which is totally backward. You have no idea what the avatars look like, the classes, the customization options, etc. I don't know about you, but when I play an MMO a lot of the name choice is decided on how the character looks. Every MMO I've ever played saves the naming to the very last. And by the way, the customization is very very limited. I don't know if they plan to improve this but if they don't, everyone will look exactly the same, save for their gender.\n\nI'm sorry, I wanted to like this game and recommend it. But I'm only telling you my experiences. I cannot recommmend Otherland.","October 29, 2015","false","0.8"," 243 of 275 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","243","275","4","1"

Ive been around many an mmo and while this one looked pretty and the worlds interesting (At least from the trailers) The game itself from what i saw (Which wasnt much mind you from my play time) didnt look bad at all. The gameplay even in the tutorial left much to be desired and a sour taste in my mouth. Do others enjoy it? Probably and thats fine im glad people like it I personally however cannot.

I wish there was a fence between yes and no. Because I would be sitting on it! Overall though I would not recommend the game at this stage of EA.\n\nThe Good:\n- I like the fact that character customisation is something that happens throughout the game, rather than something that is frontloaded. You give a basic bodyshape at the beginning. However the rest happens ingame. Beards, hair, accessories and all sorts are something you obtain ingame, and the look of your character is fluid.\n- The fact you can actually try out various classes ingame at the beginning. Although the current presentation is pretty awful and does little to show off the class differences.\n\nThe ambivalent:\n- Text is kept to a minimum. You don't have a wall of generic text to read upon recieving a quest. This is good in terms of keeping the flow going. However at the same time it makes the game very shallow. There is not much grabbing me to continue playing for hours on end yet here. I think here just a touch of extra narration and VA work, would really improve this. Overall though I like the way text is kept to a minimum.\n- Combat, I like how smooth character movement and jumping is. And combat can look decent, it just currently gives poor feedback. I find ranged characters play better in this regard.\n- Graphics, they are passable. At the same time however certainly not good. Particularly skyboxes and backgrounds often look horrible. And at the moment there is a lot of pop-in going on. Given how small the areas are, broken up by loading, there should be far less problems, particularly huge variation in fps. I expect optimisation to improve over time though. I hope textures and backgrounds do as well.\n\nThe bad:\n- Story is so far shallow and poorly executed. Cutscenes are largely pointless and could have been done away with. Even a minimum of voice acting might do just enough to make it more engaging.\n- Quests are highly linear and must be completed. There is no way to progress in the game without doing quests in order so far. Some quests that should be skippable are required. For example you must customise your character to progress. You must decorate and do the USpace (Player home) tutorial to progress. There is no reason that USpace should be required for story progression.\n- So far, so MMORPG, and unfortunately I don't see this changing. I think there was a unique opportunity to do something different using Williams properties. Williams describes a cyber world of simulations, and importantly social interaction. A world going beyond simple quests and combat. I think a game that didn't strictly take from Williams work and instead acknowledged the current world would have been interesting, a place not just to game, but to socially interact. Where you could jump into sims with friends and do various activities that weren't all simple combat.\n\nTo be sure I expected a typical MMO. At the same time however I hoped they would at least begin to explore different possibilities. So far there is zero evidence of them doing so. In fact socially the game so far is a wasteland. There are very few tools to interact with others. It is generic sci-fi fetch quest MMO. Very much so at the moment I am reminded of the disappointing Matrix Online.","September 12, 2015","false","4.3"," 156 of 179 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","156","179","7","3"

TL;DR at the bottom\n\nPlot/Intro\nOtherland is based on the saga of novels of the same name by Tad Williams.  In the novels, technological advances have created a virtual world accessible to humans through “surgically implanted bio-port interfaces.”  The user is able to travel anywhere and experience anything in a virtual paradise.  But paradise comes at a cost – a sinister entity exists in the virtual world and its presence causes a disease known as the “Tandagore Syndrome,” leaving its victims in a mental coma.\n\nThe game begins in a frantic rush to calm the destruction of the Virtual Reality (VR) world, Otherland.  You are met by a mysterious man named Sellars who has summoned your help in stopping the destruction caused by some devious mogul named Felix Jongleur.  After deciding whether you are Bruce or Caitlin Jenner, you are given an opportunity to test each of the 4 classes: Assassin - Energizer - Marksman - Warrior.  All classes have 3 weapons they can store which mimic specializations in other MMOs. You are told that the only way to save Otherland is to destroy a throne beneath a gigantic winged Egyptian looking creature that I can only assume is the virtualized embodiment of Felix.  You succeed in destroying the throne and the world explodes, presumably destroying everything in it.  Seven years later, you awaken in a VR holding zone aptly titled limbo and the story continues with your uncovering of dark conspiracies surrounding Otherland.\n\nOtherland is a bit of a conundrum as least as gameplay is concerned.  Everything expected from an MMO is present in some fashion or another, but there was an unnerving number of issues that forced the opinion that Otherland was rushed.  Tutorials, interface options, user friendly menus, polished mesh’s and textures, efficient quests, targeting systems, etc., were all either noticeably lacking or missing entirely.  Add to that list; absurd mob respawn times, random eternal loading screens, and a deleted character, and the frustrations associated with this release are glaringly obvious.\n\nIs it worth playing? That depends, if you are willing to support a growing project.  Like many games financed through crowd funding, Otherland will take time to perfect.  The absence of Scrooge McDuck gold vaults typically saved for AAA titles, means developers like Drago will have to piecemeal their work.  The unfortunate product of an enormous game and gradual funding is that some elements are postponed.\n\nProblemsTutorials – At the onset you are given the option to test a fully leveled version of each class before choosing your own.  “Ok cool, familiarization of the classes, right?” No. This premise is great but lacks context.  The player is placed in front of enemies and left to sort out the system, which without a framework ends up being nonstop left clicking and random button pressing.  Including a talent tree with skill explanations, or mouse-over popups for action bar icons would have vastly improved this introduction.\n\nInterface Familiarity – It’s important for players to feel oriented early in gameplay.  Where to click, what to press to bring up a shield or heal, essentially what the symbols on the screen represent.  As mentioned in the tutorial grievances, this was not present.  Additionally, certain keys did not function at the onset (when most people attempt to familiarize themselves) but unexplainably became usable down the line.  For example if you select the player equipment key “P” during the intro and first missions, nothing happens.  A likely assumption is that there is no ability to view the items you have equipped.   But an hour or so into gameplay suddenly “P” accesses the equipment screen.  Another issue is that certain keys don’t always work.  For instance, the PVP battleground menu is opened with “T,” but hitting “T” again does not dismiss the menu.  You have to hit “Esc” and bring up the options menu to close it.\n\nUser Friendly Menus – Quest's  “Submit” and “Accept” buttons were off to the left rather than at the bottom.    Scrolling your mouse-wheel to access the hidden text was futile. Instead, the player has to find a faint white scroll tab and drag it down to see the remaining quest description.  Sometimes multiple menus would overlap and complicate legibility as there was no way to move them.  As mentioned in the interface section, certain menus would not even close.\n\nEfficient Quests – The quest tracker is actually well done and the quests were simple enough.  The issue here is more about camera movement and NPC selection. Acceptance of a quest generally requires selecting the quest giver two or three times for the final acceptance of the quest.  Completion of a quest is the same.  Often times you will think you accepted or completed a quest and start running off only to realize the quest doesn’t exist or hasn’t been completed.  This wasn’t so terrible except that there is an over-the-shoulder zoom that occurs each time the quest giver is selected which can become nauseating with Otherlands bright ambiance.\n\nTargeting – Unlike other MMO’s where a mouse icon is present, or where tabbing between friendlies/enemies is available, Otherland opts for an “orient the camera in the right direction to target” system.  Not only is this a faulty targeting system, but it compounds an issue with indistinguishable NPC selections.  You can’t tell if you are targeting the right thing, this will become an issue in end-game content.\n\nBugs/Respawns/Loading Screens/Eradicated Character – All there.  Did you get your player stuck?  Well there’s no way for you to port out so I guess just wait until an admin shows up or start over with a new character.  Did you just kill that group of bad guys 30 seconds ago? Yep, they missed you.  Ready to enter the binary bar? Too bad, you have to wait forever.  Did you just get your character to level 15?  Congratulations, he’s been eliminated from our servers!!\n\nRedeeming QualitiesDespite the above issues the game is in fact functional and loaded with content.  The shading in Lambda Mall, one of the hub areas of the game, is strikingly similar to a steam punk version of Hong Kong.  The glare of advertisements and television screens obscures your vision when viewed from certain angles.  In 5-Isle, the land of the elements, the feel that you have entered a VR rendering of a Chinese farmland is comfortably fake.  Otherland’s launch screen is beautiful and, when accompanied by some smooth synthetic jazz, is reminiscent of the garden ponds from the citadel in Mass Effect.  The music was always suited to a region and appropriately complimented the ambiance.  Sound effects were properly implemented, helping to enhance immersion. Quests are plentiful and intuitive.  Most importantly the designers made sure not to have players running in circles, rather quests advance players through each zone without tiring them with unchanged scenery.\n\nTL:DROtherland is loaded with content, but it lost me.  In its current state it simply feels rushed...like they stepped up to the plate hoping to knock out a present day AAA MMO.  Too many frustrations will distract you from the game. If Early Access addresses some of these issues then player satisfaction will rise.  There is a gem inside that hunk of rock, Otherland just needs a few rounds of polishing","September 13, 2015","false","36.3"," 106 of 124 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","106","124","0","7"

I would say that the reason that I decided on  picking this up was because the concept/setting sounded interesting enough to check out. I started up by logging into the tutorial and everything seemed alright. The explanation about the different classes needs to be way better however. I also believe that there could be a pop-up window or something that explains button layout and what does what.\n\nI wont nitpick too much however because you kind of just get a grasp for everything on your own eventually after about twenty minutes. The class choices need to have some sort of explanation though before you walk into each area to test them (Like what they do, healer,dps, etc, etc,). I don't like the little fade in/fade out small print box on the side about 10 seconds before it ask you to walk into the portal to pick your class. This section needs to pop up as you test each class instead.\n\nI ran into some latency issues as well. My ping was sitting anywhere from 205 up to about 700+. I understand that this is early access, however I have to mention this. I imagine that this will be fixed with time. The servers are probably being hammered. Optimization also needs work. (This fix will also come in time I am sure).\n\nThe print is a bit small when you have a conversation with an npc to grab a quest. I shouldnt have to squint my eyes to be able to read what is being said.\n\nThe credit system: So, this is iffy to me. I understand that you need to make money, however the first thing that I want to see when I walk into the Mall area and I get a quest to customize my avatar is not to be bombarded with a whole list of stuff you have to buy to be able to customize lol. I mean, really? I just bought your game for $17.00 and not even two hours in and you want me to pay you more to customize? The least you should do is to include a few free options to make your I-robot guy look human. I understand that a lot of games have an in-game shop now days and it is a fair system when done right.\n\nIf you want an example, look at Guild Wars 2 system for motivation. The system that they have in place works because you never feel forced to buy anything. The difference here is, unless you want to look like another generic assembly line robot 101, than you have to pony up some extra cash. This is not the best thing to put right after the whole begining area folks.\n\nThe overall feel of the game I liked. The setting is...interesting and unique. The combat is different enough..but something feels off about it. I can't pin-point my finger on it..but it needs tweeking or something. I wouldn't call it bad, however it could be better. I feel like it needs to be more responsive or something. Maybe it was my ping bouncing but it felt off.\n\nThe questing feels typical but not too bland. Average at best as far as I could tell.\n\nI wish that I could recommend this title because it has the something that kind of has an allure to it in my opinion..but just the things that I mentioned and a few things that I have not are keeping me back from voting yes. Maybe in time this could change.","September 11, 2015","false","2.1"," 139 of 184 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","139","184","4","2"

I also feel  personally that a lack of Marketing,PR is a lack of effort and reflects poorly on the game as nobody  or very few ppl know or will know about the game. There are few ppl who could of brought Otherland into the light infront of thousands of ppl but chose not too because the social medias sites  have not been uptkept very well i believe one of the big time streamers who was gonna give it a try said "This Twitter looks like it was made by a 5 year old" not my words but that of one who holds weight and there for it does hurt because word of mouth is the best thing for a new ip and or new company or it can be the kiss of death.

Combat is intended as action combat but it's slow like hell. Add to that locked (animation has to complete before the next one starts) and uninspired animations which will break combat completely.\n2. Movemens feels very dull. It's not the graphics but the way it's done. Prolly it has something do to with the animations I mentioned above.\n3. Eradic server pings. One second I have a 10ms ping to the server and the next one it's over 200. And that's for Europe with the server almost next door for me.

Also many reviews have little to no hours played which seem less legitimate IMO. My review has over 300+ hours played, and though yes I am a cultist who enjoyed the novels, the game in itself is good too. I won't lie, it is an E.A. and it is unfortunate that we can't experience the whole game just yet, but the devs are working hard and I look forward to official release. I have equated this game to a dusty corvette. Once the polishing is done it will shine, for now if you play you must have a bit of patience. The devs have been extremely helpful and communicative via tickets, forums, and real time chat by friending them on steam. They've brought out two holiday events to help keep the current playerbase satisified. It is a small playerbase atm but that also means it's a tight knit community that's very helpful. Moderators are also pretty cool, even one joined us in our multiwebcam tinychat session we had one night. More details are as follows:\n\nCombat: many complain but we've seen improvements over time, such as suggested on the forums sticky modification and crosshair mods too. They have plans to do an overhaul to it, which I am personally not interested in but it seems the majority is.\n\nStoryline: I am biased because I read the books and it makes sense to me, but I have heard those that haven't read them get lost in the plot.\n\nPlayer Housing: I love the idea of having pvp like taking over of one's home so that harvesting eDna and putting up NPC guards will protect it. This feature is not implemented yet.\n\nCrafting: It is rough at the moment, no real use for it as drop gear is better and vendor pots are better. I assume they will improve this in time.\n\nMultiverse: Love this system! It gives an option to put real variety in a game. Rather than those other mmorpgs where you are stuck in one themed environment. This game being VR based gives endless possibilities to the future simulations. Can't wait to see where they go with it.\n\nGraphics: many have said they are stunning and I agree. Some parts seem dated, but with my fav mmorpg ever having been SWG I don't nitpick.\n\nCustomization: Every one of my clanmates/friends has a different appearance. Definitely better than the other mmorpgs where it appears clones are running around because so many look exactly alike.\n\nClans/Clanwars: most of these features are not implemented yet, the clanspace is pretty sweet though.\n\nClasses: yes there are just 4 (for now, but I've seen evidence there are more coming) but there are 2 stances for each giving advanced strategic players a chance to actually use their skills vs. the tab target buttom mashing that some mmorpgs offer.\n\nBusiness Model: This is the cheapest mmorpg I've ever played. I usually play FTP and spend a ton in the cashshop, or subscription and end up paying monthly for two of them. BTP is new to me, but wow I feel like I've gotten such a steal for my money.\n\nSystem Requirements: This game runs, not optimally but runs, even on my cheapo pawnshop laptop. Which is nice when I am at college away from my leeter gaming desktop.\n\nDifficulty: As of now it's pretty easy to solo most of the game and level up fast. The devs have said they will modify this, so hurry up, jump in, and level while it's easy and quick :)\n\np.s. a lot more info in the guides I & others have created: http://steamcommunity.com/id/frayena/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides","December 22, 2015","true","364.2"," 49 of 63 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","49","63","2","2"

He's actually been keeping me somewhat aware of this MMO adaptation for some time now, which is odd, because he rarely plays games himself. If he was this intrigued by a game that he most likely wouldn't play, then, I thought, the story must be quite interesting, and so I believed this was surely worth a go.\n\nUnfortunately, as you can see by my thorough lack of game time, I'm not particularly able to review the game. I have tried on 3 separate occasions to play, and every time, even in the tutorial area, I am met with ridiculous ping spikes of 500+, shoddy gameplay (perhaps caused by the ping, though who knows), and crashes. For context, I am on the EUW server, living in the U.K., and have no issue with my connection in other games.\n\nAs an example of the shoddy gameplay, while trying out the Marksman class in the tutorial (which gives you access to all or most of your abilities), I would fire at an enemy from range. If I tried to kite them, as you'd expect from a ranged class, they would reset back to their original positions, regenerate all of their HP, and evade any attacks while they moved back. Odd, I thought, perhaps they have a specific aggro range. Maybe if I try kiting them around their original spawn point, instead of far back like I did last time, it'll work? No, they still reset. As a ranged class, I have to sit in melee while they whale on me. This would be solved by a tank, of course, but it's still quite ridiculous that I can't kite.\n\nFor all I know though, it's only the tutorial enemies that act this way. I have never played for more than 10 minutes in a single session, as I always crash.\n\nI'm not sure yet if I'll request a refund, or simply wait and hope it gets better, but right now, this game is not playable for me. I can't recommend a game that I can't play.","September 15, 2015","false","0.6"," 53 of 73 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","53","73","0","0"

If you are charging for a product or service then that product or service is open to review.  If you are selling a product it is considered a final product whether it has an "Early Access" stamp or not.  EA is not a promise of fixes or updates, it is a promise of NO PROMISE of fixes or updates.\n\nI will not discuss the following topics as I have no experience with them...\n-End game content\n-Crafting\n-Clans\n\nNow, on to what I have experienced...\n\n-Tutorial-\nBeyond WASD the tutorial teaches you basically nothing.  You will discover sooner or later that left and right click have different effects with your weapons.  What are those effects?  Who knows, the game doesn't tell you.  It also does nothing to establish the universe or what is going on.  You will literally have to look up the novels on Wiki or have read them already to know who anyone is or what is going on.\n\n-Graphics-\nPassable.  Texture work on most of the NPCs and players is mostly nonexistant as the Simuloids(?) or whatever you are called all mostly have sheer metal bodies.  This isn't a complaint, could very well be a legitimate design choice based on the novels, I don't know for sure.  The different zones I have been to are infact varied and colorful, the hub world is mostly grey, however.  I am also dealing with dropping frame rates in some areas as low as <1FPS but this is not too common.\n\n-Sound-\nBackground music works fine.  Sound effects however are either very soft or aren't there.  I've noticed footsteps in some areas go away and leave you feeling awkwardly quiet as you travel.  Launch day problems?  Can't say for sure.\n\n-Combat-\nThe MMO meat and potatoes.  There are 4 classes to choose from.  Melee tank, melee DPS, ranged DPS, healer.  The skill trees are linear so I don't really see how any one ranged DPS will be too different from another once the game is in full swing.  The actual issue with the combat is the "feel".  All of your attacks are weightless.  There is no feedback when performing a skill or ability.  You will go looking for your skill tab to figure out how best to set up a rotation or what abilities do what but you will only find vague explanations like "Damages enemy/Heals party member".  There needs to be some solid data in the tooltips.  Damage dealt, range, etc.  When executing an ability it is hard to tell if you've hit or missed your target, or if the ability has actually gone off, unless it has an over the top animation.  These things matter in an MMO.\n\n-Misc. Thoughts-\nI've gone through the menus and found that I could Lock Targets using Caps Lock but this doesn't seem to have any real effect.\n\nMost in game menus are buggy or broken in the scrolling will only work one way, tool tips will stay on screen until I close the menu and reopen it to view a different tool tip, background not appearing making the text in the menu very difficult to read.\n\nTimers in the player housing are all cut off and don't fit their respective frames.  Seems like an easy fix but a strange thing to make it this far into the dev process.\n\nTake it for what you will.  Watch some (recent)youtube videos, check out a Twitch stream or two, and make an informed decision.","September 10, 2015","false","4.4"," 169 of 272 people (62%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","62","169","272","11","22"

I've hit loading issues, exe crashes, server crashes, and an inability to 'try' classes.  Finally, after skipping the best part of any MMO (character customization) I was able to try out the classes and 'beat' the throne room.  After which I was given the pleasure of watching the sub-par video cut scene with 4 men grunting in different voice tones.  Recommendation?  Skip the voice acting.\n\nNow, before I could get any further, the servers came down for maintenance.  At 2:30 PM CT.  For maintenance at Midnight CET on Nov 2nd.  Maybe my math is off, but I think I've just travelled back in time.\n\nOther complaints at this time include the quality of the grammar used in quest or interface text, inability to attack while jumping, and the barren nature of the tutorial.  As the first place a person experiences in your game, why leave out anything that would excite or entice them to play more?\n\nNow, I'm almost positive some of you are thinking "But wait, this is EA.  Of course there are going to be issues."  To which I'll respond with a quote directly from the store page:\n\nWhy Early Access?\n“Otherland is a huge game which has been in development for many years and is now nearing completion. However, as a small developer we still need help from the community to give the game its finishing touches."\n\nMany years?  Finishing touches?  Not in this build version.\n\nIn the end, I'm displeased with the game and the experience I've had so far.  I'm going to continue giving it a whirl because the underlying premise promises so much to be excited about.  But I wanted to get something out right away so that others take the "Mostly Positive" review status this game has with a very large grain of salt.\n\n-Medicius","November 2, 2015","false","1.4"," 40 of 53 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","40","53","0","0"

The first being the basic tutorial area where I could customize my character, try every class and choose it and not much else. The second being the newbie area or starting zone, where I got to fight for real, (more on combat later) the area look like it might have been knocked up in a few days maybe a little longer if you take into account the 6-7 models that the level designer copy and pasted to break up the literally flat rectangle pond that the level is comprised off. This whole starting zone looked just boring with any interesting landscape off into the skybox.\n\nThen I got to the first vaguely interesting part of the game so far, where I zone into a big digital city, of witch I spend the last 20 mins. This was OK because you can sort of justify a city being made out of cubes of gray but even then the quality was very poor. I would like to say more but literally it was so plain that there is not a whole lot else to say.\n\nThe General Look to the game was poor too, I put this game on Ultra and the textures are very low resolution, blurry fluorescent lines cover your character with some generic scifi looking gear skinned over it, the weapons had a few different models but all have the same effects. And the game just does not look up to scratch for the power of the engine. In a word this game looks old, So lets move on too...\n\nGame play\nTo say that the combat in this game was simple would make clicker games seem complicated, there were some skill attacks but none of these did any real damage compared to the autoattack, in witch you hold your mouse button down in the direction of a NPC and it slowly dies while kicking you in the shins, none of the combat felt remotely satisfying. The targeting system was what ever you put in the middle of the screen, there is no movement or dodging that needed to be done, no blocks or defensive ability apart from a weak knockback that mainly just slowed you down from killing things. There was no customization in skills that i could see and gear was generic enough for me not to care about it.\n\nOverall the only thing i can think to say is that I would not recommend anyone buy this in its current state, and unless this game drastically changes in the next few years i not sure i will even give it another chance.","September 12, 2015","false","1.3"," 35 of 50 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","35","50","0","1"

Otherland is one of those games.\nI consider myself a veteran MMO player, as well as a fairly casual gamer. While I appreciate some guidance and instruction, I've played enough to find my way around without having my hand held.\nAt this point in time, I can't bring myself to recommend this game, and here's why:\nShort version:\nPros:\n*Interesting concept - worlds with different themes. That's what had attracted me.\n*Try classes out before selecting.\n(Short list since I'm not through the tutorial yet)\n\nCons:\n*Little to no instruction in the tutorial (except for movement)\n*No skills page to learn what your combat moves actually do. This is a deal breaker for me. (Edit: You do get access to this after choosing your class)\n*Don't seem to be able to re-arrange the skills in my hotbar to where I want. What is intuitive for someone else might not be for me. Granted, I didn't pay a huge amount of attention to this, but given the only way to access skill tooltips is in the ESC menu, it likely won't work. Another deal breaker. (Edit: found it. CTRL key for anyone interested)\n*No traditional account creation. Had to wait for an automated activation email.\n*MASSIVE ping rate - 700+ms - and I'm in Europe playing on the EU server -.-\n\nLong version:\nUpon starting up Otherland, I found myself confronted with a typical ELUA and a fill-in for my email address. Entering my email informs me that I'll be emailed account activation instructions shortly. OK, that's different. After about 15-20 minutes wait, I finally received the activation email. In I go, and find myself with an androgynous... android? avatar and an NPC with a trophy over his head. No interaction instructions, eh? Fine. Start running the gamut of usual MMO controls and stumble across the action button. Get some basic instruction on movement and a little avatar customization, then away we go to the class training area.\n\nFour portals, one to test out each class before choosing your favorite. Great! No regret for picking one that doesn't suit you later. Unfortunately, there is also absolutely no instruction for combat basics or class descriptions. Not everyone reads player tutorials or class descriptions on websites, guys. Ok, so I try to check out the skills to see which does what. Skills page? Where? No? Had to go into the pause menu to get the cursor and hover over each skill. Really? So far I haven't seen much difference between the four classes. Root grenades for the ... what was it... Energizer? didn't seem to work, and I lost patience before figuring out the Assassin's sneaking. I have yet to actually choose my class and plan to give them another run, but so far I don't see myself playing this much if at all.\n\nThe concept of different themes in each world was an intriguing one, and I hope I'll find more intriguing things if I can bring myself to play beyond the tutorial... otherwise Otherland will be one more Early Access regret purchase...\n\nUpdate: Completed the tutorial and selected my class. Now have access to the skills page, inventory, and all that jazz. Woo. Followed up with the 'Rescue us from the corrupted sim' quest line, then got sent to the area after. Where I was stuck in a loading screen. I wasn't impressed before, and I'm still not that impressed. The four classes feel pretty stale. Your usual shoot'em up or hack'n'slash types, but the ping rate is still so terrible that it makes no difference. I feel like I'm poking mobs with a butter knife... My advice: don't waste your time or money unless there are some major changes since this review.","November 3, 2015","false","1.2"," 22 of 40 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","22","40","0","0"

Nothing has been fixed from that long ago beta play from the combat which is stale to the graphics (I could write a long paragraph on this but I won't) and even to the fact that the loading screens crash the game flat out says to me that the ones working on this game either signed a bad contract when buying the rights to this mmo saying they had to keep the old crap or they just aren't listening anymore and are trying to get money out of this IP.\nAt this point its clear they either need to sell the IP and game to a different studio with the resources and team to make it a great game or they need to start listening to the players. Because if they don't this once glorious game should just be returned to the developers hell it was pulled from as another "what could of been" instead of wasting those who have been loyal and waiting for years now waiting for this game.\n\nI'll remove this bad review when and if they actually do something about this game and make it into something great.

I'm also a Star Wars fan, but I don't love every Star Wars game that comes out.  However, this game appeals to me as both a fan of the series and as someone who plays games.  Sure, it has some bugs and stuff, but this is Early Access, which is pretty much just Open Beta where pre-orders get to play before everyone else, and expecting a polished product is like expecting raw hamburger to cook itself and have a bun magically appear around it.  Looking past the bugs and the other issues, I've found the game to be very, very enjoyable so far.  Combat is pretty straightforward, and like many of the game mechanics isn't exactly a new system for anyone who has played other MMOs, but they don't feel like I'm just playing a different game in a new package either.  Visiting the world and interacting with characters from the novels also helps make the game more interesting for me.\n\nIf you don't mind beta testing (and have some patience), I'd recommend checking the game out for yourself.  If you don't like beta testing, then I'll still recommend the game, just wait until it is a little more polished to get started.\n\n","January 12","true","9.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

The story and environments are varied from Tron-esque cyberpunk cities to Asian-themed areas. The whole game makes me feel like I'm playing as a player playing an online game. Is that weird to say? Probably. It's a weird game. It's definitely not bad by any means, and I think it's one of the most interesting MMOs I've played in a market of stagnation. The devs try really hard to keep the game current and interesting. There's some passion there that I really do respect.\n\nThe only thing I can't get over is the combat system. It's incredibly clunky and feels awkward to play. Enemies seem to take -forever- to kill, as my warrior archetype at least. It's not inherently bad, but it's nothing compared to action combat systems like Tera or Neverwinter or even Guild Wars 2. I really hope the devs can take a look at the combat in these other games and improve on the hit detection, hitboxes, and general feel of the the combat because right now it's just not that great.\n\nTL;DR it's a fun little MMO diversion with an interesting world that needs more players, but it definitely has issues in the combat area.","November 28, 2015","true","4.8"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

I'll start with the all too common observation that the launch was an unplayable fiasco.\n\nI was seeing lag spikes yesterday pretty much anytime I was in combat, to 1k+ ms.  During the "Choose your class" tutorial it took me about 10 minutes to defeat a "boss" monster because every little bit, me and the enemy would just stare at each other for about 10 seconds before finally resuming bashing each other's heads in.\n\nBut let's talk about the current state of affairs.\n\nCombat lag spikes seem to be a thing of the past, haven't seen them at all today,\n\nI've only tried to log into the NA server and that works just fine.  The only oddity is that the first time you play the game it queues you for the EU server and you have to change it to your desired region.\n\nThe main showstopper I have now is zoning to/from Lambda Mall causes a black screen that requires a restart of the app about half the time.  Also, the game tends to crash on me about every 20 mins or so.  So if you expect to get into this game and play for an extended period, bring several good luck charms, you're gonna need it :)\n\nFrom the state of the game about 3 years ago, I don't see a whole lot different other than the HUD's ability tray is better designed, your U|Space looks a bit better, and the placeholder login screen has been replaced with a slightly more functional one.\n\nI know Early Access is just a cash infusion while the devs continue developing the game, but still, releasing a product in this state sets a poor first impression.\n\nTL;DR - Instead of "mostly working with some rough spots", I rate this game a "carnival of crashes".  If paying to QA this game appeals to you, awesome.  Otherwise, see you in 6 months :)","September 12, 2015","false","9.7"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","1"

Very glitchy, too many bugs to report. Constantly getting stuck in geometry (had to delete one character that couldn't get unstuck), dissappearing mobs & NPC's, water effects in inappropriate places (splashing footfalls on top of a tower!?), and balancing of difficulty needs MUCH more work. Basically unplayable as yet. Will give it another go when it's in final release.\n\nSo far the interface and quests seem like a copy of every other run-of-the-mill MMO. In this case, this actually works to the player's advantage if they're familiar with MMORPGs, because there is absolutely no explanation in-game of how anything works. I really haven't seen anything (other than graphics - WAY WAY WAYYY TOO MUCH BLOOM!) that would set this apart in the genre.\n\nI like the concept, but there doesn't seem to be anything that hasn't already been done to death in the MMORPG genre. Not worth playing at this stage, but will come back for another try when it's ready. Only recommending 'yes' because the game isn't finished yet, and 'no' doesn't seem quite fair because, again, it's not finished.","December 3, 2015","true","8.9"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","1"

If you want a smooth, content complete gameplay experience- don't buy this. It is clunky and definitely has some optimization issues. Only time will tell if the developers will be able to actually get this to a launch worthy state.\n\nHowever, I like it. The world is cool, it has a sort of Phantasy Star kind of feel. Combat wise it is much like Tabula Rasa, FPS with lock on targeting. Quest dialogue is never more than a few lines of text, if that, so the story does not exactly draw one in. But the general idea is unique, you are playing in a computer world and travel among different simulations with varying themes from the far east, to lush planets, with a cyper punk city serving as the main hub. So far there are a lot of missions, housing, clans, and the crafting system just got overhauled.\n\nYou never know with early access titles, but if you have $20 you want to risk and hunger for a sci-fi mmo that is different from the mainstream- give it a try. Just understand what you're in for...","May 2","true","5.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

If you try out the game on NA or Asia servers until EU is fixed you have to live with havy lags. Im realy glad that i got a general impression in under 2 hours that tells me i dont like this game, this i way i could get a refund without any trouble thx to the new steam system.\n\n\nWhy i dont like it?\nFirst and for me most important things of all, this game feels like it was developt under heavy drug consume. The tutorial are witch looks like a wannabe matrix literally hurts my eyes, when you out of the throne room and in the first area everything looks like the graphic design where never finished and colours are so crazy that you get sick of it.\n\nA dev told me yesterday each class has 2 stances/roles. so i tryed around a bit in the training area. I have realy no idea what the talents on the numbers 2-8 do. The primary attack seems like its building charges like other games witch you can use 4 a heavy attack on the right mouse button. Than it seems you have something like a selfbuff on 1 witch recharges also through your primary attack (i think) but takes a lot longer. Every Class has 2 weapons but except the look and the style how dmg is done (fast low dmg shots or slow heavy dmg) i cant tell where the real difference are. They say warri is the tank class but there is no info witch weapon is for what, you have an axe and a spear and thats it. There are also funny shiny buttons with a skill for buttons E and Q but you cant use them somehow (so no idea what they do).\nWhen you exit the throne room you look like a human with a metal body, no idea where "wide variety of character customizations" should be here. I usualy expect the Char design right at the character creation screen but now idea when it comes here. Maybe when you waste enough time with the stupid tutorial and prolog that you break the 2hours mark and cant refund the game any.\n\nPvP\nSure i havent try out PvP but from the playstyle of the classes i think that the Energyzer will be primary the heal ♥♥♥♥♥ in PvP. The Marksman has (thx to his rifle) a very big kitting ability, while using the rifle he can run and shoot at full speed this will be for sure a big advantage in PvP because most other weapons with slow you down or full stop your character if you use them (witch makes the energizer a very stationary and vunalble target).\n\nIF you want something equal like Otherland but without bugs and so on, go and try out "Skyforge" or if you are more the Story based type witch prefers more than just action and also has fun with riddles you should try out "The Secret World". Both great games and far more enjoyable and with lot better Char and Skillcustomasation and more Classes. Basicly everything that this game has they have more and better stuff to offer. Ok there is no housing and PvP is designed in a bit other way in both games but well who cares, you can still beat up your enemy and get rewards for it, thats what is important right? ;)\n\n@Devs You guys should realy work your tutorial, it is the first thing the players see from you game and right it makes your game look realy realy bad. Sure some of your screenshoots look realy nice but when a new players sees this the tutorial first he maybe think, urghs i fell betrayed and will (maybe) get his money as long as he has the chance. The first impression is the most important thing everywhere and right it is realy bad. So you maybe think about fixing this point to or to you will happen the same thing like to the team from "shadowrun boston".","September 11, 2015","false","1.5"," 16 of 41 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","16","41","0","5"

Not surprising, all things considered. and no worse than I have seen in 15 years of Everquest. There is also the matter of refinement being needed in text and quest dialog for consistency and clarification. Also not surprising considering where game development has taken place, and the fact that original development ended some time ago and more recently was picked up by a new team.\nThe upside has multiple aspects.\nGraphics are excellent.\nContent is wideranging and expanding with development.\nQuest tasks minimize repetitive actions and advance without enormous time sinks being involved.\nProblems are addressed in an expedient manner, and dev's responsiveness far exceeds any I have experienced in the past with other companies.\nThe potential is readily apparent in the scope of the existing world at present, and bodes well for future development.\nI have 90 hours played, primarily as a marksman character on the NA server, and have thoroughly enjoyed the game thus far.

Well it seems Otherland succeeds in blowing all those stereotypes out of the water, offering a very interesting and refreshing take on the MMO genre.\n\nOtherland takes place in a proteiform virtual reality (some will fondly remember TRON or Ready:Player One) where several worlds are interconnected. SciFi, Medieval, Cyberpunk, ye olde Fantasy... What's great about Otherland in that regard is that it manages to give you a huge variety of places to explore and lores to delve into, but everything is connected by a red-thread storyline. It's not just variety for the sake of variety, it is, properly speaking, Universe Building, in all its coherence. One might add, it is all done with respect to the original works it is based on.\n\nI have to admit, the setting is what seduced me firsthand about the game, but I also ended up liking the mechanics and gameplay, even though I'm usually turned off by the standard MMO experience. As I said, the Otherland experience has nothing to do with Classic MMOs. Controls are tight, intuitive and responsive. Combat strikes just the right balance between Tactics and Action. Think Mass Effect without the active pause, or Gears of War with deeper class-based strategical depth.\n\nCustomization is also a real forte in this game. Where other MMOs will have you wear palette-swapped armors on predetermined characters, Otherland allows you to tweak your character's base model to your liking, and craft completely unique gear through an innovative Digital DNA systems. Oh and you can craft NPCs too. Yes. You can craft NPCs.\n\nNow, not everything about Otherland is great, and I have to admit, even though it looks good, and the artistic direction really nails the different vibes of the worlds, it's really heavy on light and particle effects for my taste, and you won't be able to benefit from the best graphical performance on lower-end machines, where other MMOs usually run without problems. But once again, OL has nothing in common, for better or worse.\n\nOne thing is also worth noting, OL is really polished in comparison from other  Early Access titles (i'd say more than EA titles too but that would be a bad pun). Can't wait to see what devs have in store for the following months, provided the servers hold!\n\n","September 11, 2015","true","3.3"," 12 of 43 people (28%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","28","12","43","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/niyoru/recommended/376310/","niyoru","Wintersand","http://steamcommunity.com/id/niyoru/","798 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOkay: Its a yes from me.\n\nWarning - This mini review ignores standard mmo launch woes. I am only previewing the content that works, ignoring the launch bugs such as lag, server disconnections, crashing and other such things. I will update this later if these do not get addressed.\n\n---------------\n\n1) Combat  - Its pretty fun when it works but the four classes are like four different games entirely. The combat can be clunky, awkward and at times downright impossible to play with. I am also worried that there will be zero customization, at the moment everyone has the same class and abilities so I can see no way to be a different Energizer to anyone else, except gear.\n\nMarksman is very clunky ,you lock to a single target while shooting and its hard to swap targets. Did not feel like there was any weight behind the weaponry, impact was not visible. Hard to tell what was going on.\n\nMeanwhile, Warrior feels very slow and heavy. Attacking is a slow, steady process, doesn't seem to have any weight to the attacks at all.\n\nOpposite that is Assasin, incredibly fast paced attacks and stealth and your traditional rogue nature.\n\nAnd finally, The Energizer. Some sort of wierd techno-gunmage, and the class i picked. Most responsive, VERY pretty to watch, and easiest to use for me. It was the only one I felt had any feedback to attacks.\n\nPros:\n\nFun when it works\nVery pretty gameplay wise\nSatisfying when you win an encounter\n\nCons:\n\nExceptionally clunky at times\nNot fun when it doesnt work\nVery difficult to pick up combat\nNot easy to learn a class\nZERO class customization.\n\n\n2) Gameplay\n\nStandard quest stuff really for a mmo. Go here, kill that, rescue this and do that. Not seen anything special here in the question as of yet, but the quests are given a little bit of fresh life by simply being in this strange setting. Rescuing 'player' npcs and reading the dialogue was pretty interesting.\n\nI hope to see more quests of a different nature as I progress. The story itself was pretty interesting and gripping for me, too. I like it.\n\n\n3) Visuals\n\nThey are very pretty. They are stylised, and very pretty once you get out of the tutorial zone. It has a definate VR/sci-fi feel to it which is what they are aiming at. All in all, i am very happy with the visual aesthetics of the game.\n\n4) Tutorials\n\nNeeds an overhaul.\n\nOne of the worst tutorials i have ever encountered for an online game. The explanations are short, not expandable or in depth and often they seemed to leave me questioning what exactly I was supposed to be doing at that step, and/or what that particular explanation even meant or referred to. Case in point? I am still completely clueless as to the SEED system and the research lab for my apartment and i dont know what it does. I think i must have missed a dialogue box here.\n\nAll of the parts of the tutorial could be smoother, with longer dialogue and they DEFINATELY need a 'for more information click here' thing that will expand and fully explain every system as it appears.\n\n5) Audio\n\nVery cool sounds and music. Nothing else to say here, although the healing sound effect did get particularly annoying after awhile.\n\n6) Customization\n\nThere was a suprising lack at the start, but then once i completed the tutorial zone i was allowed into an advanced shop which was awash with many, many customization options from changing races to Lizard, Magma, Rock, Metal, Cyborg and Bird skins to colors, hairstyles and all the good stuff you expect to see. Not as advanced as say, elder scrolls online but pleasing enough.\n\n7) New Player Orientation (this is not tutorial)\n\nVery, very poor. If you are waking into this game with no outside knowledge of the books, you are going in blind. I understood very little of what was going on, where I was or anything at all really. There absolutely must be an explanation for somebody who has not read the books, because inevevitably online games draw people in who may not read the background information outside of a game.\n\nThat said, i enjoy exploration and the unknown so I had a blast absorbing the world but many new players may simply just disengage and leave rather than attempt to understand or get involved.\n\n8) Summary, or TLDR:\n\nFun setting, interesting gameplay, average combat. If you like sci-fi-fantasy or have read the books, give it a go. Very, very well priced for what it is as a buy to play title. I do not regret my purchase, I hope to see more updates and bug fixes as we go. I am looking forwards to checking out more of the game.","September 11, 2015","true","9.9"," 12 of 43 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","12","43","0","1"

They have pushed a small patch out already with more in the works. The servers need to stabalize a bit, but beyond that it's nothing too huge. I have not had much time to play yet, unfortunately. I will say the devs respond to the threads here - and they seem like genuine, nice and motivated people. The sci-fi aspect to this game (cyber-punk) is something that does not really exist yet - so hopefully they can continue to add to this game!\n\nFrom what I've seen of the combat - it's not too bad. I do miss a dodge mechanic though and the UI / Controls were a little confusing at first. The patch today seems to have made those areas of the UI a bit larger, easier to read.\n\nIt seems that f1-f3 changes your stances / weapons - and im assuming each stance has different attack styles that you unlock as you level up.\n\nGive the devs a break, they are just computer and gaming nerds who have spent more time devoted to an art that most in here can say. Not fair to bash them personally because of the launch.

I like the concept of a virtual multiverse. I think with a little more love from the Devs, this could be a pretty good game. Obviously this is Early Access and the Devs are probably hard at work to fix the issues that the community points out (well, at least I hope they are).\n\nThings I felt needed work:\n-The combat felt kind of clunky at times and the targeting system can use a little more work. Switching targets didn't feel fluid and often hindered combat.\n- There would be times where I felt the skill buttons were a little unresponsive.\n- You AI friends didn't fell like they helped all that much while the enemy AI were very quick to swarm and overwhelm you.\n- Some minor graphical issues that I'm sure future optimization plans the Devs have will fix.\n- I had a cutscene not play for me in the 5square(?) area. The part where they were going to have the festival after you gathered all the villagers.\n- Character customization could use some work as well. Allowing us to zoom in and out, or turn our characters would be appreciated.\n- Some spelling mistakes in the conversations.\n- Would be nice if NPCs can be voiced in the future.\n\nThings that I really liked:\n- Good amount of customization.\n- Good graphics.\n- Big Sci-fi and Fantasy MMO fan, so that was really cool to see both mashed up in one game.\n- You get a home, and it's customizable!!\n- Story seems pretty cool, so far.\n\nAgain, it's early access, so I'm sure there will be lots of fixes addressing a lot of the issues I've mentioned and probably once I didn't know about. Honestly, the game has a lot of potential and if they can smooth out the rough edges, this can really turn into something pretty fun to play. My opinion though, if you do plan to buy one of the Editions, stick with the starter or the delux, unless you really want the following DLCs:\n\nMummy Skin DLC\nCyborg Skin DLC\n+12 Inventory Slots DLC\n+2 Character Slot DLC\n+15000 Bits DLC\n+4000 Credits DLC\nCollectors Edition Special Bar\n\nNot all that important. The only thing really good that comes out of it are the bits and credits you get. They did state that they are only optional and they will not force you to have to buy the DLC to play future updates. One time fee to access the game and that's it! I won't lie though. I did buy the delux, but only because I wanted to support the game.","September 29, 2015","true","3.5"," 10 of 39 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","10","39","0","0"

Contrary to popular believe early access is not a release candidate, so we are talking about a version which gets released to an audience with the intent to find bugs and get general feedback.\n\nThis is has to be taken into consideration. The game we have here is by no means the finished product and therfore has to be rated a such, a work in progress. In my opinion we have the perfect definition of a rough diamond. The game has so much potential, as it features a lot of unique aspects, which would differentiate it from its competitors.\n\n\nGraphics\nThe lighting is phenomenal..PERIOD!\nThe major hubs are already beautifully detailed with  loads of NPCs running around and doing their daily routines.\nEach zone is designed in a specific themeset which are all really well done and look great\nThe performenace is good and there are no frameproblems and/or lagspikes\nSound\nThe backgound audio greatly helps in the immersion in the different areas. When you are in the Mall for example you have the muttering of many people in the background as well as vendors yelling their offers.\nThe music is designed nicely as it also fits the areas really well and catches the theme of the zone\nCombat sound is OK, it yould use a bit more "OOMPF" when hitting in combat\nNo voiceovers though\nThe world itself\nThe world is one of the strongest points of the game, as you are not locked in one setting and the corresponding gearset\nYou want to be an archer in a medieval setting..you can do it\nYou want to be a marksman with a plasma gun in a shadowrunny cyberworld...you can do that as well\nThe fact that you play in settings that range from medieval to outer space makes each zone an individual experience that does not feel like the previous zone\n\nQuests\nThe game features a plethora of quests featuring all the known queststypes like "kill X of Y", "FedEx quests" and "escort the dude around"\nThe game does nothing spectacular new in this department, but also nothing wrong\nEach zone has a questarc that guides you through the whole zone and also functions as a overspanning story\nGenerally right now there is a mismatch of action sequences and "walk to" sequences, so while questing through the zones you are confronted with a load of just walking from A to B...this is pretty certain just a matter of not yet implemented sidequests\nThe gameplay\nThe combat still needs some work, as it is somewhat clunky and unresponsive\nEach class comes with a variety of skills..these skills still need a balancing pass, since at the momenet the best solution is mostly "keep autoattacking"\nAs of yet I can not give any input regarding group play (instance play or PvP), but since there is the trinagle (Tank, Healer, DD) there is certainly potential in this department\n\nInterface\nYou are presented with a functional interface that you are familiar with from other MMOs\nThe customization options of the UI are limited right now, so at the moment you have to use the standard layout and placement of the individual parts of the interface\n\nHousing\nEach player has his/her onw appartment, which is the houseing part. You can customize your appartment and unlock and create new rooms in which you can for example grow Soma\nThe fact that there is a housing component in this stage of development is really promising, considering that other games talk about housing for year and dont present anything. However as of yet the housing is implemnented only in its barebone state\n\nConcluding one can say that the game already has some really well done features and unique approaches. However as of today it also has some areas in which it has to improve, especially in the combat department.\n\nNevertheless the positive aspects outweigh the negative ones by far and I have no doubt that the game will evolve into a really fun game which features aspects that have not yet been done before.\n\nReally looking forward to the development.","September 12, 2015","true","5.8"," 12 of 45 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","12","45","0","0"

The game is definately playable, but still has a quite a few bugs, and is still in need of some serious polish).\n\nThings that need to be addressed (IMO):\n1. Server stability: they are not fully available at this point\n2. FPS/Ping: frame-rate and ping are still very bouncy.  I have encountered a LOT of lag spikes and crazy frame-rate fluxuations at all video settings (from fair all the way to ultra I only experience about a 10 fps difference but the spikes are terrible).  Just needs some optimization which will usually come after full release and NVIDIA (or the other graphics cards) get a hold of it to create the patches.\n3. Voice acting: so the sound on this game is great, but the literal lack of ANY voice acting from the NPCs is annoying to say the least, and fully takes away from the game.  I am hoping that this will be added with the full release of the game but have not read into the game enough at this point to know for sure (FFXIV ARR had no voice acting all the way through CBT, it is often times the last thing added to a game).\n4. Quests: The quests (at least through the first 10 levels and a bit beyond that) are VERY linear.  The devs have stated that this is a BIG game so I am expecting that to change.\n5. Skills: also quite linear with little variation as to how you customize your play-style.  More varation would be greatly appreciated, Especially for those that prefer PVP (as it does not really play like a skill based game i.e. FPS, variation is the spice of life).\n6. Classes: only 4 classes?!? Hope there is a chance to branch out further down the line.  Once again variation would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAll this being said, it is solid MMO with a lot of potential that I plan to keep playing for the near future.  For the $17 price tag and no subscription nor a reliance on a cash shop it is a great bargain!  Keep it up devs; please don't dissapoint!!!","September 15, 2015","true","35.3"," 6 of 31 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","6","31","0","0"

There's no current end-game content.\n\nThe 6 months (or more) that Otherland will remain in early access will mostly be a bug/polish phase for the MMORPG. This means IF YOU BUY THIS GAME, DO NOT EXPECT IT TO BE POLISHED. IF YOU WANT A POLISHED GAME, GO BUY A GAME THAT IS NOT IN EARLY ACCESS.\n\n\nEnvironment\n\nOtherland is different in that you are a simuloid or essentially a piece of code. Which allows you to go into a variety of worlds and opens up many options not typically available to standard humans.\n\nCombat/Classes\n\nClasses are pretty basic in this game. Total of 4 classes that can each have 2 different roles.\nCombat needs more polish and tweaking, it can be frustrating at times, but by no means "buggy". It just feels a bit clunky in some cases. In the same sense Tera combat felt clunky when it first came out because you had pausing between abilties. As a Marksman I can move around freely and shoot on the go, which is more than most games can say.\n\nI have completed all the early access content.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone looking for a different MMO that doesn't mind the game not being polished.\n\nI would NOT recommend this game to anyone looking for a polished MMO that is going to run like WoW or ESO. The current game does NOT run smoothly and can feel clunky a lot of the time compared to something like WoW. Otherwise you'll be saying, "Gee, I like this game... but something feels off." Yeah, it does, because you're used to extremely smooth AAA mmo's.\n\nOtherland had a bad first couple of days, don't let that deter you. It's worth it for the price if you like the idea and want to support the development of this game.","September 12, 2015","true","25.7"," 29 of 85 people (34%) found this review helpful","34","29","85","0","1"

The Login issues are annoying, but should not stand for the quality of the actual game.

If the game can stick to the high standards in the future, I think we could have a very good upcoming title. The current login and crash issue are annoying, but should not be the reason, that we let the game fall.\nI suspect that once these first problems are solved the game will develop in the right direction.\nI will keep playing and hope that Otherland can develop to the game we expect and hope for.\n\nGreetings\nZ3rf3tz0r","September 12, 2015","true","6.2"," 20 of 64 people (31%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","31","20","64","2","0"

It offers three levels, or options if you like, with varying numbers of credits which can be spent ingame on costumes and other useful but fairly standard fare like extra inventory slots, character slots, etc.\n\n\nGood bits\n\nGraphics - very bright and cheerful. The characters, in spite of the relatively low number of useful customisation (vanity!) options at present, look good and move nicely and there's an amazing variety of shapes and sizes of npc's giving us a lot of hope for future player customisation. Interestingly, the game allows you to change every aspect of your characters appearance pretty much whenever you feel like it.\n\nThere's a good variety of weapons and the very welcome ability to use any weapon you find. That means that a ranged character can have a backup melee weapon available and your melee character has the ability to pull mobs with a ranged hit. That's a really nice feature. You can actually slot three weapons, which have various effects, and swap between them at will and you get regular upgrades as you progress through the story.\n\nIt's possible to wear any costume/armour item you find. Of course, there's not always much point but being able to do so makes a very nice departure from the standard MMO system where 90% of the drops are useless to you. The npc's offer you quest rewards which are upgrades to your armour as you progress through the story, as they do for the weapons.\n\nThere's an attentive and friendly team working on the game which interacts well with the community. They're monitoring, and taking part in, discussions on both STEAM and the official Drago forums. They're open to new ideas and suggestions and doing a great job of keeping people informed of progress with bugs etc. which they are clearing at an impressive rate.\n\nSo far at least, a friendly and helpful community seems to be springing up - certainly on the forums, ingame I can't really comment since I've been soloing so far but I've had no negative issues at all with other players.\n\n\nNot so good bits\n\nCombat feels a bit clunky for an MMO. It sometimes feels more like an old FPS model. Maybe a result of using the unreal3 engine...I don't know. It's not bad and I was sitting on the fence a bit, not sure whether to put this in the 'not so good bits' section because it does work quite well. It's just not as fluid as most other MMO's, lets just say it still needs some work.\n\nAt present Otherland is a bit short on quests. The ones that exist give you a very linear progression up to about level 35, and quests are where the bulk of the exp comes from so thats pretty much as far as you can get without grinding.\n\nSome confusion over powers, quests, etc. where things aren't explained terribly well and quest markers over npc's heads but not shown on the maps lead to 'additional exploration'. That can be a pain when you're trying to work out what you're supposed to be doing but there's plenty to explore in some areas and it's nice to get around and see what the developers have been creating :)\n\nCharacter customisation (described as 'from tiny to huge') is a bit limited at the moment. You actually get from slightly larger than average to slightly smaller than average...certainly nowhere near the range of sizes the npc's enjoy. And vanity (costume) items are hidden by the armour rendering them pretty much useless at present unless you plan on standing around Lambda Mall and not doing any fighting!\n\n\nSummary\n\nA long way to go yet, lots of bugs which are being worked on and the character customisation isn't as flexible as some other MMO's but for me it's fun and I'm enjoying playing the game and trying things out.\n\nIt's worth saying again that the 'not so good bits' are due mainly to the early state of the game in its development and are being worked on. I've only been playing for a few days and I've seen some major improvements already, the development team really are getting on top of things.\n\nOverall, after having played for nearly 30 hours, I quite like the game. If you can cope with the inevitable issues that exist in all games at this stage of development then I'd recommend giving it a try.","September 16, 2015","true","57.4"," 14 of 50 people (28%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","28","14","50","0","0"

It's about the world near the end of the 21st century, in which virtual platforms are fully integrated into everyday life.\n\nIn the book virtual reality allows you to move to different worlds and experience alternative endings of well-known book stories (like for example The Odyssey and The Iliad, The War of the Worlds or The Wizard of Oz).  Also in the game there will be many different worlds, which players can explore.\n\nAt the beginning game moves us into a new virtual world. Very innovative and interesting  is that we can test every available class before we make a choose. I was playing WOW or GuildWars and had to start a game again a couple of times to decide which class suits me best. Because of that I really like Otherland solution.\n\nAlso the combat system is original and you have to get used to it gradually. Game diversifies climatic music, which helps you feel better the Otherland world. The world, which still need some grind, but even now is interesting and promising.

Not one bit, quite far from it. It have it's own style based on the cyberpunk culture and a more rough and unpolished edge to the mechanics and expression of the game that makes it much more charming then the usual WoW copycats that have cropped up the last decade or so.\n\nIt takes a while to wrap your head around the way the game works but it actualy have a decent tutoral that guides you gently though it in a couple of hours or so. There are 4 classes in the game and you can try them out in the beginnig of the game to get a feel for what class suits you play style the best which is really a nice feature compaird to most other NMMOs.\n\nThe grapics is actually quite beautiful and very unique style that I appreicate and the story while not a masterpiece it's still interesting and easy to follow.\n\nSo the basedline is that if you want to try something that is very different from what you can find today in the MMO scene and have a love for cyberpunk then Otherlands is for sure for you.\n\nIt is an early access game and with that comes some features that is not finished yet and other features that will be removed from the game as time goes :)\n\nFor now Otherlands have captured my curiousity and heart and I look forward to play it and follow it in the time to come.\n\n","September 13, 2015","true","9.1"," 8 of 36 people (22%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","22","8","36","2","0"

Concept of the world provides Otherland with incredible environmental variability, some simulations are really awesome, Mars rocks!\n\nAt this very moment, i can't give it 10/10, but definitely 3/3, because "Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three." :D\n\nP.S.: sorry for my english .)\n\nUPDATE - November 9th:\n\nServer issues from recent days seems to be finally fixed and game runs much better now (no lag spikes, infinite lag, etc.). I've sucessfully finished all available story line quests without any hard bugs (yes, there are some problems with few quests and arena is still kinda buggy, but nothing really gamebreakable) and i must say that i really liked it. Mausoleum part is great, zombies are awesome :)\nHaloween Event which was barely playable because of server issues, was finally funny, at least after the server fix. 8Square Haloween boss seems to be fixed atm, i had no problem with targeting last few kills. Game still needs a lot of work, i'd like to see patches / fixes more often, game has NO END GAME CONTENT at this moment, but anyway, i would recommend it, of course only to players who like to participate in EA / beta testing and don't expect final product :)\n\nThank you for reading, thumbs up for my fake review please :D","September 28, 2015","true","80.9"," 8 of 36 people (22%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","22","8","36","3","0"

GRAFIXX: since I run a nvida on my laptop i had HUGE fps issues to begin with, I am talkin of averaging 8-12fps essentially making it unplayable - workarround: go into your nvidia CONTROL PANEL and manually tell the grfxcard that it has to use all its juice and not just the base chip for this programm - now i run 50-60fps and that in highest setting . This is straight up a retort too all the people complaing about grafix; YES its not the newst grafix engine there is BUT if you max everything out it will actually look really nice and potentially your rig wont even be able to handle it.\n\n2. HOTBARS: now EVERY class has two PRIME skills, those skills are essentially stances. so if u you activate one that certain skills can be used and vice versa - so best solution imho was to put the prime skills on 1 (one) and than you can arrange the encessary skills in the hotbar which will change over. Now the game at this moment doesnt tell you which skill works in which stance so you simple have to try and drag themonto the hotbar and see if stays there or not. Once I had that figured out I acutally had some interessting combos running. BUT - DO NOT TRY TO DO ANYTHING HOTBAR RELATED IN LAMBDA MALL - because thats a nonpvp zone you cant do anything - just like the different stances the game wont tell you that it simply wont work giving you the impression that something is broken when its acutally not. I had a pretty nice conversation with one of the devs ingame bout a week ago point those things out to him and it sounded like the be working on impletmenting basic things to make that more obvious.\nSo by and large I have to say im quite opptimistic that the game will end up being a good product, the IP is awesome and the story unfolding very much fits into the established OL universe.\nBUT we do need a lot more players so get cracking and see you online","September 22, 2015","true","26.3"," 10 of 41 people (24%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","24","10","41","2","0"

I haven't read the books (yet) and the game doesn't exactly overflow with information during the first hours of playing, but the science-fiction/virtual reality setting looks suprisingly fresh and imaginative. The graphics, while not state-of-the-art, are very detailed and - together with some really nice music and sound effects - provide a very immersive atmosphere.\n\nCombat is relatively easy, at least as a Marksman. The targeting and target locking didn't really click with me initially but the general gameplay feeling of jumping around shooting normal and special arrows at stuff is similar to what I had in other MMOs with similar ranged classes.\n\nThere were still quite some bugs, but fortunately most could be resolved by relogging.\n\nThe game looks like it offers a lot in terms of customization. I also liked the fact that you get housing in an early stage of the game already.\n\nOverall, this game so far is in pretty good shape for an early access game in a lot of areas while needing some work on the quests, UI and bugs mainly. I haven't tested group play yet, but the 4 pretty clear archetype classes pretty much suggest what to do I guess. The Marksman feels like fun so far and I really feel like exploring this world some more.","September 13, 2015","true","18.1"," 10 of 41 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","10","41","0","0"

Good combat, amazing environment and just a great overall feel. Simple UI that is easy to navigate, decent quest objective tracker (if u get a bug, abandon the quest and do it over, takes a couple minutes at most). I really like this game and it seems to have a good community within it. Now what I wish they would add: Professions (Non-Combat ones). This game is clearly an excellent place for a true Roleplaying type of environment. You have your own apartments, live in a beautiful futuristic city and generally look like a total bad ♥♥♥ (lots of customization options for aesthetics). In my opinion, for this game to truly flourish they should add numerous non-combat professions and other integrations to encourage players to interact on a non-combat social level (as well as a combat one). I know that it's early access, so they still have plenty of time to implement stuff like that. The devs have been really cool too in responding to everyone upon launch and doing everything that they can to make the game better. Maybe there is more social stuff that I haven't seen yet. I hope to see some non-combat stuff like diplomacy, stealing, politics, etc. All in all this game has a lot of potential, few bugs for an early access launch and an amazing ambiance.

Otherland was originally announced under a different developer in 2008. Since then it has had a troubled history and now Drago Entertainment (it's new owners) are trying to finish this Action MMO. Many, may not have heard of Drago Entertainment before but they were involved in another Action MMO called Grimeland and a few other published games. Grimeland looked very promising but the publishers pulled out and that was basically that.\n\nFirstly, it is more in a true late Alpha / early Beta stage with some of the fundemental game mechnics in place and others seem to be in flux. The graphics use UE3 and althrough a little old looking it is a pretty, colorful MMO with some nice varied zones. The gameplay seems to be typical but a slightly slow Action MMO style. There is crafting and housing now plus other aspects in the pipeline. Much of this needs to be fleshed out.\n\nOtherland had been in development for a number of years, firstly under RealU and now under Drago. It comes to EA in a rather unstable state but is playable, if you are willing to be patience. The developers seem to be active on the Steam forums and in bug hunting, but it seems they have a big job in front of them. It will be interesting in seeing how Drago come to terms with the base code developed by the original developers RealU, as there is talk of Otherland only staying in EA for another six months.\n\nIt is too early to really review Otherland at the moment. Maybe, In a month and we can see how the developers and Otherland progress, so we can get a better idea for the future. For now, this Action MMO is very interesting yet has conventional in-game mechanics but brings a nice refreshing style to the grahics. Fun can be had, but for now expect a lot of rough edges which the developers seem to be working to smooth.

So far gameplay was quiet smooth for me, besides of tutorial which is kind of confusing and doesn't really\nexplains how to play. But if you are familliar with an MMOs you will easily figure it youreselves. I really liked the metamorph options which allows you\nto customise you character in basic way at the beggining and later on there are a lot of ways to change it when you reach the lambda mall. Sadly i bought only\nthe basic version of the game so i can't really test it but from what I've seen it is awesome. Combat system could be improved but it's really good that it is\ndifferent from any other MMO that i played. Also i really like how devs are addressing to the community. They are honest and they seems to really care about\nplayers opinions.As for graphics, It is quiet good for an MMO from and from what i read there is a huge variety of maps with different styles so i am looking\nforward to see how devs managed  to create all of those different simulation that i read in books. The things that i didn't liked is that there is no group content so far\nbut i hope that it will be added eventualy. So devs keep the good work, stay focused and communicate with us the way that you do now.","September 14, 2015","true","23.5"," 7 of 34 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","7","34","0","0"

I know a lot of people have been flaming about the Early Release issues, but those of us who have gone through old school WOW releases or any other game release in modern history know that launch day is going to be glitchy. I have been watching this game for some time and had really high expectations for the devs to live up to.\n\nThe first thing to note is that the Unreal Engine is a great platform and the graphics have really stood up well. The game is quite nice looking and if you are savy you will notice the little icon at the top of the Metamorph screen so you can make your toon a bit more custom even if it is just a simuloid for now. (Don't worry there are more options later - you are not stuck blue forever.)\n\nMovement is pretty nice as well. I recently played a more polished game that felt completely awful when compared to Otherland. The A and D keys are bound to strafe and movement felt really grounded to me. The jumping animation is slick and collision detection is mostly in tact. I imagine there will be some fine tuning so I am happy with it - it is EA so there will be a lot of clean up as we explore and help report issues.\n\nThe combat is pretty fun. I found myself just blasting everything mindlessly because it was so enjoyable. Some may complain that it isn't as fast paced or [enter complaint here] but I loved it. Perhaps it is because I picked the best class in the game though. /wink I highly recommend new players take a moment to review the wiki for interface commands and combat at the very least so you know what to expect. There is a tutorial zone but there are no annoying popup tooltips or other tutorials to hold your hand or walk you through stuff.\n\nThe community I spent my time with were like instant family and I can't wait to interact with them more in the future. I am sure when the typical haters move along as they always do, we will be left with some really great people to enjoy the game with.\n\nI didn't run into any hiccups / glitches or problems that would make me walk away from such a cool game. I think we are pretty spoiled with all recent game releases where the games were in beta for ages or released in Korea or other countries well before we got our hands on them. Even then those games have their fair share of login server issues and misc bugs. For a game that didn't have those benefits I'd say they did fairly well their first day. Also to note they launched both EU and NA on the same day - insane!\n\nOverall I think that the dev team has been super hands on and "johnny on the spot" when it comes to addressing our issues. Did I get stuck on the loading screen or get booted from the server? - of course I did. Did I get mad bro? - nope. It will take a few days before the initial kinks are ironed out and we find some server stability - that is normal.\n\nFor those that are willing to tough it out, they will see the diamond in the rough and really start to enjoy the game. I have to say it is the most compelling game I have played in quite a long time. The short amount of time I spent in game actually made me want to experience more and learn more about the game and start min maxing and obsessing over my gear....\n\nThis is definately worth the buy when you look at the price point and all that we have in store for us once the EA is in full swing and the servers become a bit more stable. My hats are off to the devs - great job guys and I look forward to working with you to make Otherland the game I am confident you can polish into the amazing game we have all been waiting for. / cheers!","September 10, 2015","true","161.0"," 58 of 154 people (38%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","38","58","154","6","0"

The look and feel is pretty nice and I like the colors, the story and of course the setting so far.

Big Badaboom and very easy to handle til this point. The healing powers of this class a big plus.\nStory is nice so far and I'm very curious in which way the story continues in the next hours.\nNice cut szenes and the game is full of atmosphere.

Whoever is designing the set pieces and assets is very talented.\n-The music is very well done and sets the mood for the game extremely well.\n-The main story is interesting and this game will set itself apart from other MMOs if they focus on the plot instead of tedious World of Warcraft style quests.\n-For an MMO launch there are few game breaking bugs so far and very quick server queues.\n\nThe bad:\n- It is an MMO made by a (relatively) small team and is in early access. There are a few bugs/typos although fewer than many other much larger MMOs at launch.\n- Like many recent MMOs there seems to be no reason whatsoever to associate with other players, combined with the theme of this game (virtual reality) it is easy to feel like you're playing an unfinished singleplayer game.\n-All of the cool character customization options seem to be locked by cash currency. This causes most players you see to look very similar until they get unique armors.\n-The skills seem relatively low impat which is weird in an action combat game. Every skill is basically "deal a bit of damage" oftne times not even higher than auto attack.  The combat is very fast paced so having all skills basically do the same thing feels weird. I expect this will be worked out over time.\n- The extremely detailed gameworld is somewhat limited by having the areas the player can access be only a small arena. They show you pictures of all these cool buildings in the background but you can not enter very much of them at all. The design is so cool it makes me want to explore more than I am able to.\n\n\n\nSummary:\nThis is a very creative game by a clearly skilled team and I am very excited to see what direction they take it in. If you're expecting "The Next WoW" you might be disappointed but I wouldn't be shocked if this game attracts a core of die hard fans and grows into a unique MMO experience.","September 12, 2015","true","28.2"," 18 of 60 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","18","60","0","0"

Once you get to the mall you can easily wear normal clothing.\n\nThe graphics are good honestly. If you are looking for OVER cartoony, anime wow style look then no you wont get that here and that is a GOOD thing. Don't listen to the trolls claiming it's decades old. This game is not a low grade EQ1 polygon game or even Anarchy Online.\n\nCombat is a little clunky but even Secret World was like that and they polished it out before their marketing closed beta. I do find it weird that you have some combat off the bat but only after you leave to the next tutorial world do they explain what Q and E are..\n\nThere really isn't anything this game deserves to be faulted for with negative reviews at this stage. Maybe after release and nothing gets fixed but now in Early Access... This ♥♥♥♥♥ expected to be happening.\n\nHell the cash shop only has vanity items.

The mall has lots of shops that currently have buff items, cosmetic items and crafting recipes, it also has trainers and stuff which are expected.\nThere were also some bars and clubs that seem to be social areas that I didn't bother much, also some sort of mini-game looking portals which I also didn't look into yet which seem interesting cause one of them said dogfights outside and we all know dogfights are fun!\n\n-After exploring the mall the linear quest takes you to your house and makes you edit some things around it and add extra rooms which is more or less a tutorial on what the hell the personal houses are and how to edit them. Personally I really think this shouldn't be part of the main quest incase you just want to start beating up things you have to go through that crap and I don't think I'll ever bother with customizing my floor and walls in a game. (of course some people like things like that cause no life)\n\n-Finishing the house editing part it actually takes you to the first outdoor area which seems like the game has begun here because you can take more than one quest and you don't need to edit the damn floor of the area. So there you have it, basic RPG time.\n\n~~MOVEMENT + COMBAT ~~\n\n- The movement allows lots of freedom as to jumping around and even moving around mid-air like some kind of old fashion arena game which is amazing for me.\nThe attacking seems slow at first (I'm playing a warrior) but I guess that's what I get for the class.\n\n- You have your main melee attack and a bunch of skills such as AoE and disables, but of course you should know this by playing an RPG game, it doesn't seem to be missing a specific kind of skill.\n\n- What I find interesting so is that each wepon has its own special and heavy attack. These are activated by filling up some sort of "rage" bar by melee attack and then you press Q or E respectively to use the ability. Some of these consist of a jump attack, an AoE stun, a knockback, a cone and many more I guess since each weapon I found so far seems different!\n\nTL:DR\nPros-\n-Great Concept\n-Nice social areas\n-Has plenty of skills required per class already\n-Crafting\n-Good movement+Jumping\n-Portal Travel System\n-Not pay to win (so far)\n-Make your own home/appartment style thing with rooms that can be useful besides social reasons(sort of like adding a workbench to your house in elder scrolls and such but you can add many rooms)\n\nCons-\n-Buggy(Beta)\n-Only 4 classes (adding more wont make much of a difference but whatever since there's a fantasy section and its simulation there could be a caster in this)\n-Kinda linear questing so far, can't seem to find another quest outside the main story\n-There's so many pointless AI running around in shopping area, this would be nice if it was single player but come on you can barely tell apart players from NPC cause there's just so many of them","September 11, 2015","true","48.4"," 12 of 46 people (26%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","26","12","46","2","0"

The whole idea that these worlds are all simulations in virtual world offers endless possibilities. I love how different the worlds and NPC's are. It's early access and there seem to be some minor bugs and glitches but nothing unexpected. Getting 60+ frames almost always and generally not crashing more than every 4 or 5 hour isn't bad for as early on as this game is.","September 27, 2015","true","42.4"," 5 of 30 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","5","30","0","0"

Well I´m playing on a i7 4770k and a Nvidia 970.  16GB of RAM and a 27“ Display.\nI´m not that kind of graphics junkie, I prefer a good story driven rpg instead good graphics and poor gameplay. Otherland is good looking, Unreal Engine and has a great story (based on books), lots of quest and good gameplay mechanics. I really like the beginning, you can have a try on every single player class before you have to choose one of them. You´re also able to customize your char, but not that much like in other games. Never saw a graphics style like this, most likely seen in the movie Tron, buut it´s different. The sound effects and the music are good, but voice overs are still missing. I enjoy playing Otherland, it´s a good scifi rpg.\n","September 25, 2015","true","14.3"," 5 of 30 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","5","30","0","0"

After the heavy reboot, we face challenges and a new start to settle a home in our major city mall. The four classes that can be played are Warrior, Assassin, Energizer & marksman. Each class has different abilitys and different weapon, for their own unique playstyle. Weapons and armor is either bought through AH, enemies or gotten by quests. The city is huge, and all quests will give you a taste of each world the Otherland has to offer. Not only is the game fantastic looking with it UE4 engine, but also smooth playing. The controls and combat are quite decent, but not my favorit according to aiming at enemies with Marksman and Energizer. Every player also have a option to get a apartment to customize and much more.\n\nThe game do follows with pvp as i've noticed but haven't testet it yet. I've haven't tryed puplic instances besides quests, and are looking forward to do so within some teamplay, will be updated when i'm experiencing it. I do run into bugs and issues, but if we bare with the developers, then there shouldn't go to long before it's all clear.\n\nHere is a first look:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_byA-l-lVHg&list=PLxDx_O1l8oBvsWnKB8YUfc3LViI0UpCr2&index=1","September 14, 2015","true","6.5"," 7 of 35 people (20%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","20","7","35","3","0"

But I quickly got the basics and simply explored the world of this game. And it's very unique! I have never experienced such interestingly designed world in any other MMO. I loved the music and sound effects, it made me just stay and listen for a while, and that's definetely a good sign. Also the combat system is quite fun. Still a bit laggy, but hey - it's an early access. Btw I chose Assassin and didn't feel disappointed.\n\nTo be honest, the game still needs to be optimized - I had a few freezes when the game loaded something "ad hoc", but I guess my laptop also has something to do with it. Anyway, as an early access game, it's good and I hope to see more improvements in it. Of course, crashes and bugs happens, but anyway I feel very hopeful for this moment. Definetely I'm waiting for the full version!\n\nGotta read the books, btw :)","September 14, 2015","true","2.2"," 7 of 36 people (19%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","19","7","36","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wolfsong73/recommended/376310/","Wolfsong73","Wolfsong","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wolfsong73/","121 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAm very pleasantly surprised by Otherland overall. The creators have done a great job in recreating the world(s) described in the stories. Vibrant, bizarre, and incredibly imaginative. The character customization system is very well implemented, and I like the versatility it offers now,and can only imagine it expanding into the future.\n\nIt's also neat "meeting" Renie and !Xabbu in-game, heh.\n\nI don't know what their long-term goal is with Otherland, but a virtual world like this has amazing potential to become something far more than "just a game", and I hope the developer taps into and really makes the most of that potential. Lambda Mall is the perfect social hub, and can become a great place for a strong in-game community to be nurtured and built.\n\nWith that in mind, I'm a bit concerned after playing through the first "chunk" of story in the game, where your'e sent to an Asian village. While it's a nice looking area, the amazing unique virtual world I'd experienced, from the opening tutorials, up to that point in Otherland is quickly replaced by the mundane familiarity of linear "fetch and kill" style quests that plague the typical themepark MMO for the last decade.\n\nBy the 3rd or 4th quest in, I was already bored with the place, didn't care what was going on, and just wanted to get back to Lambda Mall, to see other interesting places. Every time I'd turn a quest in, I was disappointed to see a new icon pop up. I just wanted to get it over with and was thrilled when I saw that a portal back to Lambda Mall had opened for me.\n\nIf any MMO deserves to move beyond that old and done-to-death paradigm, it's this one.\n\nNow, I understand the setting of Otherland involves a multiverse of different areas, and all aren't going to be outlandish and fantastical. That's fine. I'm just talking about the type of content. In my opinion, a game this unique, in a setting this unusual and imaginative deserves something "more"; something that plays into and off of the uniqueness of the setting.\n\nFor example, a MMO like "The Secret World" - talking only about how the questing was handled - even if you forget the investigation missions (though it's not a bad idea) did a great job of providing quest content that avoided the typical "kill # of x" or "collect # of y" routine. In TSW, the world was as much a part of the setting as any character you meet, with its various mysteries and secrets and clues playing an important role in completing a given mission. A place like Otherland would fill that capacity perfectly, and in many different ways.\n\nStill, it's early in development, and the developers have an opportunity to make something awesome out of it, yet. I'm just hoping they strive to provide an experience as unique and interesting as the worlds Otherland is set in. I also hope they really push the virtual world/community potential.\n\nAll in all, it's fun. It looks amazing. It performs well enough and I've encoutered few bugs that I wouldn't expect to encounter in a fully released game. I can easily recommend checking it out, even in Early Adopter.","October 24, 2015","true","5.7"," 4 of 35 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","4","35","0","0"
