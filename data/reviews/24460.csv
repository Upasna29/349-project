"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lol_sutton/recommended/24460/","lol_sutton","NordicAryan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lol_sutton/","122 products in account","This expansion is not a representative of what King Arthur: The Roleplaying Wargame 1 or 2 is like. The only thing that is accurately represented would be the choose-your-own-adventure style visual novel which are pretty spot on. with the choices you make directly influencing the units you will have in the battle at end. The consequences of your actions are not always clear either. forcing you at times to carefully think about your decision lest you wish to redo the "novel" chapter to get the ideal end.\n\nThe battles themselves play more like an Age of Empires campaign level in the sense that you progress. sometimes linearly. through a battle to complete objectives such as defending for 20 minutes or gathering forces from different parts of the battlefield to attack an enemy.\n\nThe campaign map has no free-roaming and is simply select one of the three champions' storylines and begin the next mission.\n\nAll in all, only get this if, like me, you love the series and are interested in what happened between King Arthur 1 and 2 (the story doesn't have anything at all to do with the legends of King Arthur, so if buy this solely because you love the King Arthur legends then this won't serve you any purpose.)\n\nFor five bucks (USD 5) the game is to me a 7/10. nearly an hour of entertainement for each dollar!","January 29, 2015","true","8.0"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

This game uses the exact same engine as the original game and the combat and CYOA book sections play out the exact same, albeit the combat had some improvements.\n\nIt is much less of a full game than its predecessor, because it is not a game. This is a stand-alone EXPANSION to the original King Arthur. So it is missing many features from the original game such as kingdom management, but this is intentional as the entire point of this expansion is to be a plot-filler between both King Arthur Games.\n\nIf you enjoyed the open world and kingdom management features of King Arthur the most, you may want to skip this. If you don't mind linearity and would like to see the before-events of King Arthur 2, definitely pick this up.","May 5, 2015","true","6.9"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

The original game and all its expansions are fantastic, but this standalone has such terrible gameplay that it's essentially unplayable.  Don't buy it unless you're getting it automatically as part of a King Arthur bundle--in which case, play all of the others and don't even install this one.","January 11, 2014","false","1.1"," 26 of 42 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","26","42","0","0"
