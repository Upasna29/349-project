You should be concentrating on evading the enemy through being a target that's impossible to hit.\nYou should be damn good if you're to get the most out of this game.\n\nAnd that's what people didn't get; they were fooled by how it looked and were expecting a more open experience. So they played it as such and moaned when they didn't get much out of it in return.\n\nBionic Commando is a linear game, and it makes no bones about it. It's not trying to be an open-world roamer; it's giving you a series of tightly packed scenarios to let loose upon as you see fit, encouraging you to experiment as much as possible with the sublime tool it's giving you.\n\nAnd boy, does it reward good play; it has the best use of an achievement system I've come across, even better than Dead Rising (although it definitely took a few queues from there).\nUnder all other circumstances, I hate achievement systems; they're poorly implemented checklists of things you're likely to do anyway most of the time.\n\nYet here, the achievement system rewards you in game as well as with achievement points (less noticeable on the PC where they're simply challenges and the subsequent rewards without the Steam achievements).\nManage to kill 3 grunts with one grenade? Congrats, have an upgrade to the amount of nades you can carry!\nTaken out 3 grunts with one grenade launcher shot? Aces, your grenade launcher radius is improved!\n\nAnd each completed challenge may lead to another, more difficult one, meaning you'll scout out opportunities while playing the levels that'll let you complete those challenges. It's rewarding you for excellent play in the best way possible, and never completely overpowered.\n\nOn top of this, you have an incredibly well realised vision of a city hit with a recent disaster of apocalyptic scale and some of the best music in gaming. The first encounter with Polycraft, BC's flying mech suits, is a particular early game highlight, with a dramatic, pulse-quickening tune driving your emotions higher as you swing between buildings kicking robot suits out of the air.\nIt's exhilirating, and makes you realise that BC is one of the best "Super-hero" games out there.\nMany games that claim to be about more traditional super-heroes end up feeling flat and distinctly non-super, but BC at its best outclasses them all.\n\nIt's about larger-than-life caricatures, ridiculous technologies, moustache-twiddling conspiracies and ♥♥♥♥ing sweet bionic ♥♥♥♥.\n\nOh, and swinging like a loon through a post-apocalyptic city while Mike Patton hollers like a howler-monkey on cocaine.\n\nIt's not without its flaws, and could really have done with a little longer in development. Being able to revisit earlier levels with some of the sweet unlocks from later in the game would have been nice; a New Game + a la Demon's / Dark Souls would have been fantastic.\n\nBut ♥♥♥♥ it. This is a near-perfect slice of third-person arcade action, bombastically delivered by people who had an obvious love for the source material.\n\nAge and SSDs has also given it that wonderful Meatboy instant restart feel, positively encouraging you to fail, so that one time in 100 you'll pull off something so incredibly sweet you'll punch the air then sadly realise you don't have an awesome bionic arm like Spencer in real life.\n\nWell, you can't have a bionic arm.\nBut you CAN have Bionic Commando.\n\nBuy it.","November 14, 2013","true","10.3"," 126 of 131 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","126","131","2","2"

Though in time the overall view of the game has rightfully improved, at the time it was a resounding "meh."\n\nAs luck would have it, days before it released my console would break down. Being a poor teenager with no income, I wouldn't have a functioning Xbox for months. And then, when I *did* get a working console... it was defective and lasted only a few weeks. So did the second and third ones.\n\nSo Bionic Commando, understandably, had to wait on the back burner.\n\nApril 2010. The fate of GRIN, and the future of Bionic Commando, was already sealed. It would get another Rearmed, (which I admit I did scream in joy at when I saw the E3 reveal trailer...) a follow up to the remake of BC, and that would be it.\n\nBut hell, it was $10 and I still REALLY wanted to play it. Sign me up.\n\nWhat I played quickly cemented the game as one of my favorites of all time. I will never forget the moment when I came up from the underground tunnel into Ascension City Park, swinging from branch to branch and flipping through the gently swaying leaves. Or when faced with snipers, fortified and watching the path I needed to take. Quickly swinging from building to building, using them as cover as I climbed. Punching the snipers out or grabbing them with my arm and sending them blasting off in a way that would make Team Rocket envious.\n\nAnd when finally granted a sniper rifle of my own? Slowing down and painting the ground with the brains of my enemies, all the while a (wonderfully deranged) Mike Patton voiced a jeering Spencer, mocking his dead opponents after every successful headshot.\n\nOr, as anyone who has played the game will know.. The Archives. Little needs to be said about the moment where Groeder sends an entire army raining down into the claustrophobic arena while the games standout track, The Gauntlet, cheers you on to overcome the odds and beat some BioReign ♥♥♥.\n\nThe swinging is easily likened to Spider-Man, but isn't quite as mindless. Your bionic arm will not automatically connect with anything just by pressing the attach button; you must aim your cursor and find a spot yourself to latch on to. It can be tense, especially when you're trying your best to get out of a hailstorm of bullets, or trying to get in a better position to attack a Biomech that is mercilessly hounding you.\n\nThe music is phenomenal. From "Enhanced Tunnel Vision", to "Hunters of the FSA", down to "Groeders Theme".. every song is incredible. And yes, of course, the standout track that everyone instantly thinks of when playing this game-- The Gauntlet. I still feel a rush of adrenaline when I hear that song... though I might just have something wrong with me.\n\nI want to keep going on about this game and why I love it. The challenge/upgrade system, the multiplayer, even further into the grappling system, Mike Pattons insane dialog, the BEAUTIFUL scenery... but I've received criticism before on writing way too much.\n\nThere is only one thing the critics got right: The story. It is... goofy. And that might be a tad bit generous.\n\nFinally, I want to address something a lot of people might not be aware of: The developers behind this game, GRIN, closed shortly after releasing this game.\n\nThose devs went on to create Overkill Software (yep, the Payday guys!) and Ulf Andersson, the genius designer on BC, ended up becoming Wolf in the Payday series.\n\nTry and imagine how different things would be had this game sold as well as it deserved to.","January 27, 2014","true","23.7"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","31","34","0","2"

As fan of the original, I am happy to see it get a modern mock up. Although it was clear they changed some things (like, the ending), I was happy that the developer brought the classic back in an updated fashion and then used it for the basis of their full on modern sequel. And in this sequel, the game play is tremendously fun. The grappling hook arm left nothing to be desired. Unfortunately that is the extent of the awesome. The story is predictable, passe, and all around dumb. Simply put, it makes little sense (even with having played the original and the reloaded version of it), and, where the voice actors do a decent job with their lines, those lines are frequently so bad that they could only save it if they lampooned it.\n\nIf you ignore the story, which you should since it is that bad, and take the game to simply be a long ride with a grappling hook and a variety of challenges, then this game is great. If you care anything about story, look elsewhere.","December 25, 2014","true","7.6"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","23","24","4","0"

If you can look away from the somewhat bad acting and the fact that it-s linear and not open world like it should've been, it's an amazing game. And don't get me wrong, the game has a great story, just not well acted.\n\nI really love the bionic arm, swinging around is not like in Spider-Man, here you have to aim your swings on your own and it feels great, doing an awesome swing while shooting an enemy hearing the epic main theme in the background is something you'll never forget, it makes you feel like a badass.\n\nTo anyone that wants to play this game, I recommend you play Bionic Commando Rearmed first. This is a sequel to that game after all. And if you see something called Bionic Commando Rearmed 2, get away from that disaster as fast as bionically possible. That game ruined the amazing franchise that is Bionic Commando.\n\nI also love this game because it's a swedish game, and I'm swedish. Its one of the first games I mention when someone asks what games come from Sweden.\n\nI'd rate it like 9.0 out of 10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raklar/recommended/21670/","raklar","Raklar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raklar/","365 products in account","This game could've been decent if it weren't for the ridiculous punishments for going as much as 10 cms off the intended pathway (instant death in most cases) followed by an awkward checkpoint that forces you to redo the same fight against the same basic grunts over and over instead of putting you at the area where you actually died, all because you missed a grab and drowned/died from radiation poisoning.\n\nThis is something that only works if you've designed the game around it, such as Dark Souls, NOT for an action game that gives you a swinging mechanic, perfect for an open world game, and then limits you to small, tight spaces because everything else is "off-limits for your mission" and therefore kills you instantly. In fact, this game punishes you so hard for not strictly following the story that trying to get the collectibles in each level becomes a non-option, as you don't want to redo the same fight 3 times and listen to the same weak dialog between characters just to get a floating blue item.\n\nIt's a game that feels like it could've been so much better had it been polished, playtested for a few extra months and based around the whole idea of swinging around FREELY without being scared of instant death screens, instead of mid/close quarters fighting with an emphasis on (an extremely weak) story.","March 10, 2014","false","2.6"," 33 of 49 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","33","49","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anigmha/recommended/21670/","anigmha","anigmha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anigmha/","170 products in account","Imagine Spider-Man with machine guns.\n\nAfter completing the outstanding 'Bionic Commando: Rearmed', I was eager to see if Grin, the developer, could transfer the swing mechanic into the third-dimension. 8 hours later to beat the game on Hard difficulty, I can confirm they did. No other game does it better, not even the Spider-Man games. There is a learning curve due to the free-form nature of the swing mechanic. But once you master it - once you grasp where to attach your grapple, know what point in your swing trajectory to detach your grapple, understand which direction to shift your weight to, and think far ahead to identify your next two or three grapple points - once you master all that will you truly feel like a "rad" Bionic Commando.\n\nThe swing mechanic also integrates with the combat fluidly. You swing around to avoid bullets, lasers, missiles and other projectiles all while getting into angles that will allow you to strike the enemy at their most vulnerable side. The enemies are usually a mix of airborne and ground units which presents a plethora of challenging scenarios and opportunities for badass maneuvers. Your arsenal is primarily the usual shooter-game affair except for this one move where you latch on an enemy with your grapple, zip towards them at high speeds and kick their face in. Swing, zip-kick, swing, shoot, swing, zip-kick, shoot, swing, shoot, and so on and so forth at different enemies without ever touching the ground. When you have a chain going, it's beautiful.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a good number of areas where the fight is too focused on the ground. You can still swing, but since most of the enemies in those areas are infantry units and sometimes there isn't much room to swing or there are too few surfaces to grapple onto, the game feels less like Bionic Commando and more like an average third-person shooter. Also, the fact that you can't zoom your gun while swinging despite being able to do so on foot means half of your bullets are likely going to miss when going for fancy shoot/swing combos. It encourages the separation of combat and swinging when the game is at its best when the two are merged seamlessly together. Thankfully the game is at its best majority of the time.\n\nNow moving on to the artistic aspects. Before the game was released, a graphic novel was made available called 'Bionic Commando: Chain of Command' (which I was still able to find via Google search). It sets up the game's plot and promised an exploration of the theme of human enhancement - using bionics beyond a "cure" for physical disabilities. Well, the game's story squandered that opportunity (although the story is still passable by gaming standards). The score, however, is an amazing modern interpretation of the 8-bit original.\n\nFinally, the multiplayer. There is nothing much to say. I've never tried it since the population is virtually nil. I would imagine Capture The Flag would be awesome with the game's unique traversal system. If you're reading this and know others that are interested, we should get a game going (though we have to use Hamachi or Tunngle since Capcom dropped their servers).","November 27, 2013","true","9.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

This game is the long awaited follow up to NES title of the same name. Once again players jump into the bionic boots of Nathan Spencer to swing around via his bionic arm, play with guns and throw cars at a giant mechanical worm.\nThe story wrapping up the action goes that following the events of the original Bionic Commando cyborgs were tossed out like garbage, while Nathan was used as a scapegoat and sentenced to death for crimes he didn’t commit. Naturally the cybernetically-enhanced people were outraged by this and formed a terrorist group to fight back, detonating an experimental weapon, wiping out the population and destroying Ascension City. Fortunately for Nathan, the attack was on the day of his execution so he gets out of jail to kill the terrorists.\nMissions take place in and around Ascension City and for the sake of level linearity most of it – except for the places Nathan needs to go - is dangerously radiated by said experimental weapon. It’s also a good idea to stay out of the water as Nathan sinks like a rock. This is also the biggest point of frustration in this game as there are several portions where you have to swing across floating mine fields - miss a mine and you’re sunk.\nThen you have to sit through a load screens which can last several seconds and make what should be a simple second or third attempt a big source of frustration. The second gripe is that these unavoidable load screens are far too common – every time you come to another check point you’re greeted by another one, breaking the flow of gameplay significantly. Fortunately, Grin has done an excellent job on the swinging controls and even indicates to you the perfect time to jump saving you a lot of unnecessary frustration. Holding down the trigger after you jump will cause you to grapple onto the closest target automatically as well.\nThe bionic arm can also be used as a weapon to throw an object/enemy. Aside from the arm, Nathan has a decent selection of guns too, including his classic machine gun. On top of that Bionic Commando introduces new toys including rocket and grenade launchers - all of which are made available via pod drops throughout the game.\nIf you can look past several frustrations, you’re in for some impressive environments ranging from the city park, down town areas to deep caves. Navigating them is the simple task of moving from way point to way point, and dispatching enemies along the way.\nAlthough going from “point A, to point B” sounds repetitive, Nathan isn’t your usual silent tough guy – his character carries the game well. He’ll let out a yell when you take an impressive jump or swing. On top of that, he can take a jump from insane heights without dying - where most protagonists in recent memory would crumple.\nBionic Commando also sports some of the craziest boss battles in recent memory, including one against a giant robot worm in a parking lot. The other enemies range in size from swarms of robot insects, to generic soldiers, and armoured soldiers with a weak spot in their back. Some fights will even see you taking on up to three armoured soldiers with nothing but rocks to throw.\nBionic Commando is a strong action game, but it's nowhere near groundbreaking. The groundwork has definitely been set for this franchise and I'm excited to see where Capcom can take it.","July 15, 2015","true","10.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","2"

Despite a slow start and some small annoyances like a lacklustre story and some weird technical choices, Bionic Commando is very fully featured and comes with its own achievements, collectible/upgrade memories, area notes, a great variety of enemies, excellent boss fights and most importantly a plain old fashioned fun central gameplay mechanic.\n\nHighlights\nThere were plenty of highlights in Bionic Commando for me and none of them stood head and shoulders above the rest because most components were fully rounded. Large open maps were very rare in gaming until Croteam came on the scene years later, and the textures, changing environments, well designed levels and artifacts all create a compelling and fairly memorable world.\nThe weapons are also rounded, and in most modern shooters you'll find yourself sticking with just one or two weapons, whereas in Bionic Commando, while the firing animations are occasionally mildly annoying, everything is well designed and different enemies and situations warrant different weapons. The variety of enemies is also worth mentioning, even if I thought the standard grunts were frivolous and redundant by the end, the different types of enemies with different variations added a depth to combat, and the boss fights all have a small setup, good intro animations and a genuine need to remember arm moves and combat techniques to progress which harks back to the good oldschool learn-and-apply method.\n\n* Consiquential achievements are far too rare and they're used here to give you upgrades and extras when you experiment with your abilities. They actively reward varied play. Bulletstorm is the only other game I can think of off-hand that does anything similar and it's very welcome.\n\nMistakes and Annoyances\nThere was nothing game-ruining here, but there were a few annoyances worth mentioning. Right off the bat the tutorial segment is a frustration because the controls are mapped for console rather than PC, which stand out because the mechanics take some time to get used to. Small things like the unskippable cutscenes which made for waiting several seconds to load the same boss fight each time you died, collectibles having a strange audio flag that pulled you out of any immersion, and the God awful menu system which makes you go through 3 menu progressions, then reload back to the title screen, then access another two menu points to quit just boggle the mind. Together these small annoyances made this feel like a slightly weaker title.\n\nThe other thing that actively takes away from the game though is the marriage between great voice acting and poor dialogue. The dialogue is really subjective, and personally I found the crude humour and occasional bad one-liner fitting for what is essentially a fun mindless action game, but after hiring such great voice actors it's a shame they haven't spent more time and effort on the story and writing, which could've easily made a good game great.\n\nRecommendations\nAt just £6.49/9.99€/$9.99 at the time of review, Bionic Commando clocks in at an average play-time of 8 hours and the collectibles add at least another 6 or 7 hours for completionists. This is also a fantastic game to come back to and I can see anyone interested in speedrunning having a blast trying for a faster completion with this game.\n\nMy conclusion then, is that this is good value for money and a good buy for anyone who doesn't mind a mildly dated and fairly mindless but strong platforming shooter with a hidden depth of ability.","August 22, 2015","true","9.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coldstonetgs/recommended/21670/","coldstonetgs","KibsNBritches","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coldstonetgs/","364 products in account","Being one of the older gamers and growing up in the NES era of harder then fsck games, this game resonated in me, thinking of the NES Bionic Commando (and having to beat it in shifts with my brother, since we were allotted a 30 minute timeframe to play games in as a kid).  I didn't know there was an arcade version before, just the NES version. But here we go!\n\nPros:  It's Spiderman with guns.  You start out with gunplay (and what you think is a weak pistol, until you start aiming for the head), but the game eventually becomes swinging, shoot and dodge and throw things action.  To me the swinging action felt natural and easy, without the "optimal swing" suggestions from the UI. There were many panic'd moments of swinging under buildings and all while dodging enemy fire, hoping for that moment when I could pop up and do massive damage.  The plot takes so many twists and turns, that you can't (until the end) guess where you are going.  It can be forgiving.  Enemies respond  appropriately to being approached in melee range (often snapping out some sort of electic stunning/killing baton, or taking advantage of your zipline).  It's gorgeous for the time, and even now.  And the humor makes me laugh (see the easter egg regarding the mechanical worm, your character breaks the 4th wall talking about it's health bar, and on playthroughs Joe suggests you fsck it which your character gives a VERY APPROPRIATE RESPONSE of uhhhhh).\n\nCons:  This is NOT the glorious open world game that it should have been. It falls into a "We'll keep the player confined due to a crappy mechanic" catagory, which makes it much more linear then it begged for.  Yes, I realized that the whole area is full of radiation, but the moment I hint about getting on the edge of where the designers ment me to be, I don't want to immediately die to radiation.  The same applies to water, yes I realize a giant metal arm would drag me down, but I didn't expect to drown in 3 feet of water before the game EXPLAINS it to me.  And while I praise the plot twists, I also lament in them... there's times where the plot makes zero sense (mysterious congression member that is only there to be Joe's foil, I'm looking at you).  Or is easily guessed.  Especially at the end where...  Well, I don't want to do any spoilers but the jump from when you fight Groder, who has final boss material written all over him especially considering the NES game, until you fight the actual final boss... makes no sense. It's like the writers and designers went "Ok we have to finish this up". The final boss battle is a simon says mashup that is painful on the keyboard (if you've gone with the origional keybinds, which INITALLY MAKE SENSE).  It's probably better on the XBox controller that the onscreen commands referense, without notating keybinds.  I felt like I was playing the old Track and Field games, letting go of the mouse to twitch/mash the F button.  Even the menus and all leave me with thise sense, losing a ton of interesting reading to the "ok, do I press the down arrow, or the actual down button (bound to S) to read all of it?" syndrome. The ending left me feeling... unsatisfied.  That's all I want to go into without spoilers.  It wasn't even worth waiting for the epilogue, especially since the last part isn't even translated (thank you wikipedia).\n\nFinal Verdict:  If you can get it on a grand sale, it's worth it. Like a $3 or less kinda thing. You'll have 5ish hours of gametime, feel mostly satisfied (until the end) that you are the speedy, dodgy, spiderman killing machine you are, only occassionally hampered by game mechanics, random deaths, and a final fight that is stupidly annoying on the keyboard with the default binds.  And you'll get that rush of being spiderman. With guns.","February 19, 2015","true","7.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","8","9","4","0"

But I had a blast unti I got there and then it was game over. Nothing left to hurt over except the ending. Don't let the ending  color this gaming experience. The game was done right with solid controls and gave you a fair amount of freedom to get creative. The developers even left it open ended in their own way but this games ending was a back-lash the end ended the next one in a heartbeat. The gameplay has everything going for it so just forget the stupid story behind it and enjoy it proper. Problem was they over reached in the story and when for the most dramatic they could think of... instead the story turned into a bad joke. Story aside, kick-♥♥♥ game. Made Spiderman seem kinda lame. He had the great story but questionable controls. Which one would you really enjoy more on that note?

It was when nearly every company was looking to have their games be more darker, serious and brooding.\n\nIt happened as Inafune was outsourcing most of Capcom's IPs to Western devs. And to be fair maybe that's the only reason this series ever made a comeback. Because of Grin's interest in the series. Or atleast that's my take from it. Even having tried to work on Strider and Streets of Rage as we know now. But back to this series. Grin made two pretty decent Ghost Recon games (and the racing game Ballistics) before making Bionic Commando Rearmed. I had no idea what the series was at the time but the remake received pretty unanimous praise back then and after playing it later I must say it's an amazing game. It's a frolicking Indiana Jones -esque action platformer where you gun down nazis and eventually explode Hitler's head in graphic, satisfying detail. It's a colorful adventure with funny writing and with gore in appropriate places. It plays, sounds, looks and reads great and it had it's own distinct vibe.\n\nNow how does this relate to the Bionic Commando Reboot and to what I said earlier about bad timing? That vibe is gone. See when Grin could reimagine the series for the reboot, they took all the story elements and made them super super serious. Basically gave it the ol' 'Man of Steel' treatment. Nathan "Rad" Spencer is now an angry vet with cornrows and a gravely voice. He's been left to rot in jail for years after saving his country but having been sentenced for "war crimes". Nathan is called to action one last time by his old friend Super Joe who also talks all broody and is voiced by Steve Blum doing his Jack Cayman voice. Joe tells Spencer that unknown terrorist group has nuked one of their cities, killing millions and it's up to Spencer to traverse the city and find out who's behind the attacks. Spencer also looks to find his lost wife.\n\nAlso worth mentioning briefly is that Nathan Spencer is voiced by Mike Patton whose music I love but I think he's terribly casted in this game and his delivery doesn't come across believable in the slightest. He's better at voicing characters like the Darkness.\n\n(Spoiler) Super Joe later turns out be evil and it's revealed that Joe killed Spencers wife so that her mind could be put into Spencer's trusty Bionic Arm for it to have worked in the first place. Joe and Spencer later have their final battle in the sky. Joe ends up dieing with Spencer falling down out of the sky. It's uncertain if Spencer actually dies and the game ends with cliffhanger with no sequel in sight ever. (End Spoiler)\n\nIt's these kinds of changes to the story and mood that affect other areas of the game and by extension my enjoyment. You see form follows function. So with a darker mood in the story comes a darker color palette and environments in the art direction. That said the game is too grey. Like way too gray compared to the vibrant palettes of the previous games. The environments also consist mostly of different parts of a destroyed city. It's a sad contrast to the caves, factories, jungles, mountains and forts of the previous games. I shouldn't feel depressed when playing a game about a guy punching evil in the face. Unless it was done well like in Rambo or First Blood, but that's beside the point. I don't think that's what the series should be.\n\nTonally the game is a mess. Imagine if in the Raiders of the Lost Ark, Marion just died a horrible, bloody, murder porn death in the hands of the nazis because Lucas and Spielberg were feeling edgy that day. Also Marcus Brody wishes Indy dead throughout the whole adventure. Sallah sells Indy out to the nazis and him and Indy have their final battle on top of the ark where Sallah melts into nothing but you don't see if Indy died or not because maybe he was able to avert his eyes at the end, who knows. Indy collapses behind the ark and as you think the camera will pan around to show him alive the screen goes black and the credits roll. Also the movie is in black and white and instead of the Raiders score, it's the Schindler's List score.\n\nThe gameplay however is great and that's where the problem lies. Even with the depressing tonal shift it's a joy to just play. Especially just swinging around in the environment is a lot of fun. It's hard to give this game a clear yes or no recommendation. Just this muddled maybe. It's a game that you maybe should try but it's also one that you don't lose much by not doing so. And I am honestly surprised how well they turned this series into 3D and would love to see someone else implement these grappling mechanics into another game. However one flaw with the gameplay itself is that mechanics encourage exploration. You want to see just where you can get to with the bionic arm, but the game is sadly overly linear. The areas may look open but there are invisible barriers everywhere to block you. Some kill you instantly and others simply don't let you progress. This ties into the bad timing. Were it made today the game would surely be open world and similiar to likes of Just Cause 3. And while this 'modern way' doesn't work for every IP, it would've sat perfectly with this one.\n\nThe icing on the cake is that this game sold poorly when it came out. It was going for that mass appeal and just didn't reach that audience. After Bionic Commando, Grin made a Terminator Salvation tie-in game before going bankrupt.\n\nEx-members of Grin then formed a new company called Overkill who made one good game (Payday) after which they ♥♥♥♥ out a turd called Payday 2 and have since been the stars of their very own, self-inflicted microtransaction debacle. Only this time it took them 2 games to burn themselves. One could say it's like poetry.\n\nAnyway. Bionic Commando Reboot. It's okay.","November 30, 2015","true","4.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","3"

It really isn't. (Depends on your computer though.) It's a rather short game, only lasting about 5 hours if you get good at it. But those five hours have a lot going for them.\n\nThe combat is excellent, always pushing you to do your best against the multides of enemies. But it reaches a point where it keeps throwing the giant mech robots at you (Which is conviently after you learn how to use and instant kill grapple.) The combat manages to flow smoothly into the swinging mechanic, and you can zip around the area, using that as your advantage against the many enemies the game hurls at you.\nThere is seriously nothing more fun than tossing your enemies around like little dolls.\n\nBut, the game has an challenge mod, where you get in-game abilities and perks for completeing them. The problem? This only works in story mode. If you level jump to an earlier area, you can can't collect any missed collectables or try to complete any challenges. So, if you like to speed through the game and keep the momentum going, you'll miss out on a lot.\n\nThe boss fights are hit or miss. Some, like the fight against a giant robot worm, manage to be exciting. Others, like the last boss, are annoying. None of them really take advantage of the swingings, so you'll be fighting bosses on a lot of flat areas. (It would have been really fun to fight the last boss by swinging off his flying drones and shooting him from above.)\n\nThe story though, and by extension the big plot twist, is bare bones and stupid. Your goal is to fight off some terrorists while trying to find out what happened to your wife. New characters come in and pop away forever in the same cutscenes they're introduced in, and very little feels resolved. The game even ends on a cliff hanger, and you just feel cheated by the end.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes. But get it on sale. Like for 2 dollars. Because it won't last long enough (Since the multiplayer servers are down forever) to justify a big price. (There is a reason it's only 1$ to buy it for a console.)","September 13, 2014","true","7.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

Graphics satisfying. Overall, its worth it. But I recommend getting it on sale. I'm going to bash this game yet recommend it. Strange.\n\nBe aware the porting is sloppy. That is the most noticeable frustration. Movement like walking on terrain and jumping can be frustrating but because you can swing around, it makes up for it. Plot isn't anything special. Graphics are acceptable. Voice acting of Spencer is overacting and I'm a Mike Patton fan--however the script is pretty bad so that doesn't help. It's unfortunate.\n\nI agree with other reviewers on the aggravation of hitting a contaminated zone and dying quickly when your are having fun swinging around. Bad game design. Also bad designing is dying, having to watch an animation sequence, dying again and having to watch the animation sequence again. This game is full of little things like that. Just bad choices, like giving Spencer dreds. ?? Probably for easier animation. Put a hat or helmet it on him instead.\n\nI don't know what they were thinking when they wrote this game and why they did what they did but its done. Nothing we can do about it.\n\nHaving mentioned all these, I still had fun. I recommend it because it is different. There are strong and original action sequences that stand out. One of the strengths of this game is being able to use your surroundings to attack the enemy. Nice!! I am a Bionic Commando fan so I am a little biased. But if you have to make a choice between this or Bionic Commando Rearmed, get Rearmed.","October 9, 2014","true","10.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Both were kind of boring to me. This wasn't. It was awesome.\n\nStory\n\nYou play as Nathan Spencer a guy who is on death row. He is released and given a chance to earn his freedom and the location of his wife by taking down the enemies in a town that was nuked. You fight against Bio Reign a pro bionic terrorist group. In the time between the NES game and this one bionics are outlawed because of a rumor that it causes agression (and other reasons). Yes it sounds like a Hollywood remake of something simple (like half the shows on TV) but it works out fine. The story is very cool and is told through conversations between Super Joe and Spencer and messages on relays. Half of the time Spencer is serious but the other half he is not. When killing enemies he sometimes gives one liners like "Sucks to be you!" and "Go long son!". When he tries to put a password in and it isn't right he says "Well that sucks". Also the big gunmen are cocky and call you names that a 7th grader would make.\n\nGameplay\n\nYou use your bionic arm to attach to objects and swing. Use W to swing forward and S to swing back. You can also "reel in" to objects (attach to it and ram yourself towards it). It's very fun and you can go far with it. Lots of people say it's hard but it's not really hard to me. In midair even if you are not close enough to your latch target yet you can hold the cursor there and when your body gets close enough it will latch on. The harder thing to do is to reel in to attack bionics in the back (if you dont aim right you will latch to the ground). There are two kinds of enemies, regular gunmen and bionics. Gunmen can be killed by your guns and grenades or your bionic arm. You can throw objects in the world at them, fling an enemy up and throw one at the other. The bionics are the real fun enemies to fight. You swing around looking for objects to throw while dodging their attacks and then wait till they get close enough to attack while worrying that they will get you before you can throw the object. It's very fun and intense.\n\nMusic\n\nThe music is really good. It is very epic and sounds patriotic for some reason. Most of the tracks are remixes of the original theme (which are still good) but some of them are ambient and it has a very cool action theme. There is a fight in a library that will give your goosebumps because of how epic the music is making it.\n\nYou will feel so free when you play this game and swing. You can go great heights in distance and combat with just your arm. And it's pretty easy despite what others say. Checkpoints are available right before big fights so I don't understand why some reviewers like GT said they weren't. The only problem is that if you want to get all of the collectables the checkpoints are unforgiving because you could get the item (after risking your life for 5 min trying to get it) and then miss a swing or die from the enemies before you get another one.

With that out of the way...\n\n... I think whether you enjoy BC or don't - depends on the difficulty setting you intend to play on. Seriously. You get a choice of: NORMAL, HARD and COMMANDO. You can't change your choice afterwards. I like to get the most out of my games, so I chose COMMANDO immediately. And on COMMANDO... things get very very very very messy, and still other things which would make the game challenging now make it cheap.\n\nAnd that's what BC is: C-H-E-A-P. And I don't mean price-wise.\n\nBC's challenging (or frustrating) difficulty comes from its checkpoint system, where they're pretty far apart. And basically your character Spencer is not a badass; he's a wimp that can get killed by each and any single enemy you encounter. You're armed with a pea-shooter, and occasionally you're given special secondary weapons with very limited ammo. But the pea-shooter's your main thing. Piu-piu-piu-piu, goes Spencer as he has to fire 5-10 bullets into one soldier. Bam, bam, bam, goes the soldier as he kills you in three. Oh, and they can shoot you from literally miles away, even if you don't see them. Reload checkpoint.\n\nOh, your extendable grappling arm - aka your bionic part that the game's all about? Yes, you can grab enemies with it, toss them around. But about 0.5 seconds after you hook onto them, they whip out a sort of taser and send a jolt across the arm. If you're not at full health then - you're dead. Reload checkpoint.\n\nYou can go melee with the foes. And yes, they will again whip out their taser and bash you with it. Health scenario from above? Reload checkpoint.\n\nSnipers? One hit takes you out, with your default health. There's always at least 3-4 of them aiming at you from different directions. They can shoot you across the whole map. Ka-bam! Reload checkpoint.\n\nThere's robots - flying nimble crafts, or heavy earth-bound behemoths that will pump you full of led and rockets. You can't just shoot them, there's a technique to beat each. And yes, they will soon start coming out in pairs and trios. Reload checkpoint.\n\nScenario: you take out a pair of flying polycrafts in a crazy battle, and while you take a second to congratulate yourself, some 5-6 soldiers parachute from the sky and shoot you dead. Checkpoint? Oh, it was placed BEFORE the fight with the polycrafts. Enjoy! And the game's full of it, so full of this damn cheapness that about a third of the way in I just thought of giving up... and I rarely, rarely, rarely give up on a game, at least for difficulty reasons.\n\nYou die in 5 seconds if you fall into water, because Spencer can't swim since his arms weighs a ton. If your stray a little from a seemingly open-world levels, you die of "radiation" in an equally quick amount of time.\n\nDespite it all - BC is a GOOD GAME... as much as that's hard to believe. The Spiderman-like mechanics of your bionic arm are pretty neat, if a little buggy at times. They do take time getting used to. You get to dispatch of your enemies in plenty of awesome ways. The challenge system is awesome: the game offers you to perform challenges (kill 5 guards with one grenade, etc.) and rewards you with character ability and/or weaponry upgrades. There's also collectibles for your hoarding needs. The catch? Well, completed challenges and collected collectibles get saved AFTER the checkpoint. So you may find yourself pulling off extremely difficult challenges or getting that inaccessible collectible, only for a random guy to shoot you - and then you have to repeat the WHOLE section again, and do everything from the start.\n\nMy playtime's 12 hours at the time of this writing, and I'm only at about 55-60% completion of a single-player playthrough. That's pretty long for a very linear 3rd person shooter/platformer.\n\nBottom line: If you can get past its quirks and cheapness, BC can be very fun.","September 26, 2014","true","19.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/1PlayerSlayer/recommended/21670/","1PlayerSlayer","StrangeAxle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/1PlayerSlayer/","209 products in account","I'll start by saying I've re-written this review to be a little more coherent and sensible.  Bionic Commando has gotten a lot of flack, and caused an unfortunate closing of GRIN studios, whom which had a decent amount of fame due to their hit remaster Bionic Commando:Rearmed.\n\nBionic Commando, with dreadlock Spencer, is by no means a perfect game but definitely holds ground for some praise.  The combat becomes a little repetitive and tedious at points.  However, satisfaction is the real treat of the game once you've beaten a tough segment.  This player, finding himself a little frustrated at times for playing on Hard mode first playthrough, was still happy with the presentation and overall experience.\n\nThe visuals are nothing special, but do their job.  You have your standard fare of cityscapes, and certain jungle segments that looked pretty cool, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Having a toaster with a mere Intel i7 processor, and an extremely old nVidia GT520 (yes not GTX or anything beefy), the game runs pretty darn smooth, even with hoards of enemies on screen.  Never being one to bicker about framerate drops to a certain degree, I've never noticed anything game breaking.\n\nThe soundtrack is somewhat memorable, but pretty typical military pep affair -- it's what you'd expect to hear from a game like this.  The voice acting was definitely believable.  Mike Patton did a good job as Spencer.  But their choice of famous Steve Blum as Super Joe was kind of off.  Steve's voice just doesn't fit how Super Joe's character looks in this game.  Steve could've probably done Spencer's voice, it'd have fit the look of Spencer far better, I think.\n\nThe meat of the game for me was the swinging and grapple combat as is a lot of players who've favored this game.  You're given various guns and grenades throughout the game to use to dispose your enemies.  However, there's ample opportunity to grapple, throw, and zip kick your enemies just the same, and is probably better suited for it usually eliminates enemies quicker...and it looks cooler.  You can even throw boxes, crates, and other soldiers into each other for kicks.  My only beef with the swinging mechanics, was there were a LOT of deaths in my playthrough because of the questionable range of the grapple arm.  Sometimes it felt like I had to be two feet from a surface in order to grapple at times.  There are points where you have to swing across "mine fields", where the air mines are the only things you can swing from, and sometimes if you're not used to the swinging mechanics, you may die if you're not careful.\n\nA big gripe I have with this game kinda goes hand-in-hand with each other.  I'd have loved a big sandbox world, or many different trial courses seperate from the main game --without combat -- just to swing around and have fun in.  The game offers "breaks" in between combat so you can have fun, but they're always pretty short lived.  I'd have loved a bigger playground and not be limited to blue radiation clouds that can kill you instantly, and sometimes are unable to get out of due to the somewhat finnicky range on the grapple arm.  There will be times where you'll swing where you THINK you can go to shortcut your way to an objective point, but there are a stray cloud or two that will just kill you instantly.\n\nAll in all, this game isn't absolute trash, and despite certain struggles and frustrations, I did have a blast in the end.  This game is definitely meant to be played with mouse and keyboard, and it was really fun in retrospect.  After certain tough segments, I couldn't imagine people even thinking of playing this on pad.  In fact, I think that was partly why a lot of people hated this game...\nI can see one playing it again to try to find the collectibles, but they don't really unlock anything.  It's a damn shame there isn't more to the game other than the story, and the multiplayer servers are completely trashed.  But first time through?  I'd recommend this game on PC.  7/10","March 8","true","15.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

This is my first review, so I'm gonna be rambly as hell and probably lose track of what I was saying.\n\nThe gameplay is this title is just about as amazing as one could get, for the kind of action involved.  Swinging and jumping and everything makes you feel like a big ol' badass.  Shooting is sub-par though.\n\nOtherwise the game is merely okay.  The writing ranges from mediocre to laughable.  The tone is incredibly confused.  There are funny moment and Spencer rattles off one-liners as fast as Duke Nukem, but the lines are cliche and boring.\n\nThe themes explored in the game are about as shallow as a kiddie pool, dealing with trust of one's government, loss of loved ones, and betrayal.  So much more could have been done with this game.  I just can't even.\n\nOverall, it's good for one or two playthroughs.  If Capcom could get around to adding some kind of mod support, that'd be great, but the game was a commercial and critical flop, so I doubt that would happen.  This is the game that sunk developer Grin, so there ya go.","October 20, 2014","true","7.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You notice that decoration object appear 1-2 meters before your feet like debris (not joking they appear one step ahead of you out of nowhere) and massive screen tearing, there are no graphic options like vsync (if i recall right resollution was the only one to change).\n\nThen the hook, it feels unrealistic if you ever had a swing on a rope you know this feels false, thats probably why they implemented a indicator when to release.

Swinging is really fun (best part of the game in my opinion), once you get the "hang" of it you really enjoy it, its like being spiderman but better and less wimpy. The environment is usually open letting you find your own way to objectives and they are  pretty well designed. The character dialogue had me laughing not because it was intentionally funny, but because it was so generic action hero one liners that were so over the top ridiculous for the situation. Honesty that is about it on the positive stuff.\n\nNow time to bash, the combat system fell flat for me, using the different weapons like grenade launchers and LMG's felt out of place because of the awesome bionic arm that was definitely under utilized. They didn't really explore anything inovative with the arm besided movement and grabbing enemies and throwing them (sometimes into other enemies). Melee combat could've been amazing if you used the arm in crazy ways instead of just waving it at your foes. The story is barely worth mentioning since its another "where's my girl" scenario that doesn't end well. Character are not interesting and just there as place holders as something to look at. Boss fights weren't big fights but instead surviving untill you can attack (Worm fight was my favorite). But the worst of it all is the constant technical issues that can show up at really bad times, like when you get stuck in a jumping animation in the middle of a boss fight or everytime you land after a big swing.\n\nI know I bashed this game alittle but I did have fun and I would recommend it if you are more of a hardcore gamer, but I can't bring myself to recommend this game to most gamers.","January 22, 2014","false","5.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

This is a game I really wanna see a sequel!

Still, Bionic Commando one of my favorite games - I complited it firstly and then I decided it to buy in Steam as showcase of my favoriting this game.\n\nThere's some procs of this game for my listeners:\n1) Incredible graphics - It was much better than even crysis, as looking up for the time game was made.\n2) Pretty nice plot - with really unexpected twist in middle of the game.\n3) Nicely done fighting and action system - bionic hand of main character can make every fight incredibly awesome and differet from many others, nevertheless you can make a gunfights!\n4) Game is bit hardcore - for me it's more proc, than cons.\n\nAnd then, to be impersonal, I write cons:\n1) Game is short - you can complite it in 4 hours, but in case of hardcore of game, you shall be masterful to do it. Still, you can try to collect all the rare badge items (I couldn't do it for the time I wrote it, but I swear, I'll try to)\n2) Last plot twist - this is may be spoiler(!!!!), but this twist of Spencer's wife is complitly stupid is annoying!!!

Be aware if you are a fan of the series like me, this is not the remake, the remake is "Bionic Commando: Rearmed" (which is actually not bad), and I happened to pick this up with it as a bonus.\n\nIt's a simple 3D shooter/platformer. The central character Nathan Spencer (if you aren't familiar with him) has an extending bionic arm that enables him to swing around a bit like spiderman with guns, and this is his first - and probably only - departure from the world of 2D side-scrollers.\n\nThe all-important grabbing/swinging mechanic is done nicely, enabling the player to smoothly chain swings and feeling "fun", gunplay is ok (always zoom in for max damage) and the bionic arm can be put to effect in combat - making it fun to clear a mob of enemy soldiers without firing a shot. There is some throwing around of objects which can get a little janky at times but is mostly just fun.\n\nDifficulty is not (in my opinion) punishing, and the game itself is playable enough to be fun to the end - although in traditional Bionic Commando style you will be facing lots of the same enemies, so be prepared for that. Some of the bosses are a bit easier than you'd expect, although not to the point where it spoils the game, and there is one boss (no spoilers) that makes for quite a long battle.\n\nI completed it in a shade under 12 hours, and I tend to take my time completing games. The game is generally polished, except for the fact that button presses are generally listed as control pad buttons which sucks if you are playing with a KB/M.\n\nIt's not earth-shatteringly great, but I enjoyed it from start to finish and will probably be playing it again.\n\nPS: This "review" is for the single player experience. I didn't try out multi-player - the online play doesn't seem to work. The LAN play actually looks like it will be a blast, I will try when I can cajole a friend into it.\n\nPPS: There's a little bit of gratuitous swearing in this, including for one boss fight where it happens at random.

Unconventional swinging mechanics take some getting used to but are a lot of fun if you ignore the part of your brain that says the physics make no sense and play around with it like you would any other videogame mechanic. The first and last half hour or so are the worst parts of the game. This is a completely linear game, which is fine but feels very divergent from a lot of the early environments (big ruined cityscape). Once the game comes up with more plausible methods of constriction than radiation gas the problem becomes a lot less pronounced. The game is at its best when you're fighting large groups of enemies in an open area with lots of stuff to swing around on, which is a scenario that happens fairly often. The story ranges from entertainingly corny to servicably corny to terribly corny. Also, make sure you unlock the classic skin before playing because his new design looks incredibly unfitting in a game where one of his remarks in regards to a boss is "Is that a long health bar or are you just happy to see me?"\n\n8/10","January 3, 2013","true","40.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","7"

The gimmick is cool to start off with but the rose tinting soon fades and you are left with an incredibly annoying and repetitive game that offers very little in the way of fun. You will find yourself falling to your death a lot.\nThe game itself runs well and I had very few performance issues, but with a game of this age that’s not surprising. The combat is alright, it has its moments but they are few and far between. The enemies are not varied at all, once you have fought a few you have fought them all.\n\nThe setting is pretty cool, I love this sort of thing, a huge destroyed city to swing through. But there is no exploration, you are railroaded to where you need to go. The story also is ridiculous. It makes little to any sense and that is when they bother to have any storyline in the first place.\n\nIf the idea of swinging around appeals to you then have a go. That being said don’t bother trying to finish it as the payoff is lame, pointless and full of more holes than swiss cheese.\n\nHave fun? ^_^","May 6, 2014","false","12.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

The game obviously centers around using your arm to swing around the world and fight bad guys with various weapons and abilities. The basic structure goes something like this: Swing through a short entry area, swing through the world and shoot/throw/punch enemies and swing to the end of the area, and repeat. This is broken up by a few really fun boss fights, and is mostly fun. I think the best part of this game is the main mechanic: the arm. you left click to launch your hand and grip an object, and you can swing from there. the catch is, you have to manually aim where you want to swing every single time. while it feels awkward at first to control and may turn you off,  but once you get a hang of the swing mechanics and weight of your character it becomes an absolute BLAST to fly through the stages at lighting speed. The arm lets you do other things, like grab and enemy and throw them at others, kick up and punch cars around like paper, and zip from one end of the arm to another. unfortunatley, this concept is limited by some odd design decisions. the levels are very linear, and you're often punished for exploring by being hit with radiation, this game's form of the invisible wall. radiation kills you almost instantly, and i found myself sometimes swinging to get away from an enemy mid-combat only to land somewhere i wasn't supposed to only to be killed. the guns are also somewhat tame in comparison to the arm, and feel especially weak as a result with a few exceptions. Your pistol is your main weapon and gets things done but is mundane. the other weapons are the highlight here, and most shine. the machine gun tears through enemies, the rocket launcher homes in on minibosses, the grenade launcher destroys everything in the game, the shotgun rips anything apart, and the sniper, wel... snipes. the problem with these weapons is their relative rarity, and ammo is SCARCE for these things. you will almost never run out of pistol ammo but for most of these bigger weapons you'll only get 8 shots for (with the rocket launcher and machine gun being exceptions, 4 rockets and 400 bullets respectivley). these are satisfying, but you'll be afraid to use them because of the scarcity of ammo around the game. the story is very B-movie like, and the main character is unlikable throughout the entire game. the music though? top notch remixes of the original NES themes will have your adrenaline going. all in all, Bionic Commando is not for everybody. It is a flawed game for sure but if you are like me and give it a chance you might just have some fun with this one. Keep this one at arm's (heh) length, but don't be fooled by those who panned it harshly because it's still a good amount of fun.","May 8, 2014","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lavoodude/recommended/21670/","lavoodude","lavoodude","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lavoodude/","137 products in account","Bionic Commando is clearly a game that was developed and produced with a clear target market.  I was very much shocked to find that this game apparently reviewed very poorly upon release, and am even more shocked to find that others would still regret playing this game, as it is, truly, "an underrated gem".\n\nThe most fascinating piece, is that i was actually skeptical about this game upon purchase.  It was on sale, however, and also came packaged with the Bionic Commando Re-armed game.  I've never been a fan of Bionic Commando on the NES.  I thought the game was ambitious for its time, and the controls a tad confusing.  This game came across at me as another generic third-person-shooter with another gimmick in gameplay, but it is actually so much more.  Despite my lack of interest in the original Bionic Commando, i am a huge fan of Capcom games, and this game carries with it the same love and care that most Capcom games have traditionally carried.  This game is one of the best games I have played in a long time, and it hasn't been since i played Mega Man X4 as a teenager that i felt this badass playing a video game.\n\nThe clear breadwinner of this game is the gameplay.  As i mentioned, i was worried this game would be another generic third-person-shooter, with the bionic arm being another gimmick in gameplay.  However, i am proud to say that this game took a bionic fistful of my words, and shoved them right back down my throat.  The bionic arm is clearly amazing, with the range of actions you cam accomplish with it.  Swing through the leaves like a crazed bionic Spider-Man, ready to eliminate anything that moves in the most spectacular fashions.  Grab your enemies and smash them with your iron boots!  Fling your dead enemies at your enemies!  Throw cars at your enemies!  The way this game mixes classic shooting elements and a new, bionic arm is absolutely amazing.  The way you must master your swinging through the apocalyptic ruins of the city is breathtaking, and the way you can mix traditional elements with the versatility of the bionic arm is some of the most refreshing gameplay i've seen in a while.  Bionic commando is a game that is clearly designed with the gameplay at heart, and that simply touches my heart.  The game does give you a variety of paths to follow, although the game is for all intents and purposes linear.  It's a game that requires progression in story and location, much like Halo(but no one complained about Halo being linear, did they?).  Waypoints are a way of life.  love them.  In fact, the linear gameplay may be something to be desired of Bionic Commando, as too many times i have found games leaving me wondering where i'm supposed to go, or what to do.  Bionic commando is an action game, and it makes certain to keep you in the action, as well as making certain you are the absolute center of action.\n\nThe next great thing for this game is the controls.  This typically isn't mentioned in a review as far as i've seen, but i believe it deserves note.  The controls for this game are some of the simplest i've seen in a while, yet still some of the most versatile.  The controls for Bionic commando, from the tips of your fingers to the moving image on the screen, are fluid and intuitive.  The game lets you grapple on to almost any surface, which was a shock to me, as I was expecting the bionic arm to be a gimmick to use in only certain locations.  The bionic arm changes everything, though.  You can literally make your own path, and when you get good enough, you'll be one crazy flying death monkey.  it's simply amazing.  You can do about five or six different moves along with swinging and shooting like a crazed ape, and that perfect mixture of bionic awesomeness with shooting like a normal person makes the game feel so versatile.  Also of note, the jump button works finally.  ALso of special note, this game apparently features keyboard and mouse support, but i couldn't be bothered to figure it out.  The game DOES, however, work 100% fine with wired 360 controllers, and the simple way the controls are laid out is absolutely beautiful, as well.\n\nSecond clear winner on this game experience is the sound.  The soundtrack is well balanced and masterfully crafted.  The music can be serene at times, when you're exploring the ruins of the city, but is intense and fast as you progress into more enemies and bosses.  The sound effects are amazing, and if you play the game enough, your characters WILL break the 4th wall and/or go off script.  For the sake of it's short-lived life-span, i will also mention the story here, as it basically reduces to sound.  The story isn't a bad story, but with the way it's delivered(both in simple dialogue and in the voice acting), it is a bit lacking.  The best bits of your story actually come from within the actual gameplay, and for whoever voices the mad german scientist guy, well done.  You nailed the classic video game villain with your shrill voice, and the angry german accent gave the words such strength that it filled my heart with glee every time you spoke.  It was your voice alone that made the citadel level with all of your minions at once bearable, as i had to repeat that level about a million times.  I wish, however, that i could say the same for the rest of the voice cast.  While the lines do feel very silly at times, however, the easter eggs you can come across simply make this game evenmore endearing.\n\nOf final note is the visuals for this game, which are simply astounding.  I was actually pretty surprised to find such low system requirements for this game, and had a few concerns, but thankfully i was not disappointed.  Character animations are very fluid, and feel good to watch and make.  Moving around the game feels natural, the swaying of the trees in the breeze is very pleasing, and lighting is actually very well done(even in the underground caverns).  Water for this game looks AMAZING, debris flying around the city looks fantastic, ragdoll corpses always feel nice, and nothing is left to be desired, i must say.  Close-ups on characters do look a bit odd sometimes, mostly when speaking, but luckily the game doesn't take you in that close most of the time.\n\nOverall, Bionic Commando is clearly a game made by people who love Bionic commando, for people who also love Bionic Commando.  It's a refreshing piece of gameplay with some very unique pieces, and it serves a heck of a lot of fan-service.  The game even ups in replay value, as there are certain unlockables you can only access by playing(and progressing) in the classic remake, Bionic Commando Re-armed.  this may actually tend to annoy others, believing it a scheme to grind more hours into the game, but it really isn't.  for those that love the game, this isn't even an issue, and for those who are just getting into it just have more incentive to play.  I didn't enter this game with high hopes, but it proved itself to be a game that remembers what it's like to be a video game, and that itself is something very special.  Would i recommend this game?  every day of the week.  My co-workers already think i'm crazy because i just can't shut up about this game.  whatever you might play, there's something in this game for everyone.\n\n","May 23, 2015","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On top of that, the game combines this swinging with a militaristicly styled 3rd person shooter to create a very unique experience of highly mobile tactical shooter (thanks to your generally small health bar and generally limited amount of ammunition and weapon carrying capacity).\n\nWhen this game is firing on all of its cylinders, you'll have truly amazing moments where you'll Spider-Man around large maps taking out squads of enemy soldiers, their air support, and mechs bit by bit fighting against larger numbers and gravity all at once. And it can be glorious.\n\nHowever, there are a host of very real problems too:\n\n> The radiation walled death zones can be very, very annoying\n> There isn't enough enemy variation in either the number of types of opponents, nor the AI for the more advanced ones present in the game\n> There DEFINITELY aren't enough bosses, and only one boss battle takes full advantage of all of the player's mechanics\n> The weapons are functional, but not terribly imaginative\n> The linear progression of levels is not the best choice considering the player's abilities - one big sandbox or multiple smaller sandboxes would have made much more sense considering the nature of your moveset\n> The world's tone is trying to ape Gears of War bleakness far too much, but doesn't have either that game's Bromancing or gallows humor to add necessary levity to the experience, and just becomes the king of Edgelord Grim-Dark apathy\n> The plot gets mind-bogglingly stupid two-thirds in while leaving off on a horrible note that includes a bunch of QTE's in a game without any of them up to that point (with a terrible cliff-hanger tease on top of it all), and finally . . .\n> they seriously spit on the character of Super Joe, who is ostensibly the original Capcom mascot (you'd think they'd have treated him better, considering).\n\n(Oh, and the Multi-player, which is just as amazing as the absolute best the SP has to offer - think UT/Quake 3 style tournament shooting DM with grapple swinging all over the pretty big, very vertical maps - has never found even a small audience, and so is very dead)\n\nBut all of that said - this is still a great experience every once in a while to load up and play through a run on a weekend. A fine little adventure that showed off some great mechanics that could have been very well served in a sequel that would have more time to be developed (and which understood the proper level and enemy design for a swinging super-soldier character type).\n\nIn a way, it's painful to play as a result. Because you can TASTE the missed potential with this series. But if nothing else, this might be the best possible game to teach game design: it shows you so many "Do not do this" lessons, while still retaining a core of solid gameplay that you can tell it wasn't incompetence of craftmanship that was the problem here.\n","April 15","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's executed quite poorly. The swinging itself is pretty cool and once you get the hang of the controls you can have a good time with it. But the fact that the city isn't open, and you have to watch out for water and nuclear hazards make it frustrating. You'll die at least a couple of times just because of that. Had it been an open city (or had they at least removed the water and hazards) this could've been so much better. But that's all in retrospect. Now we're stuck with this game. I also really don't like how your character looks.  Why didn't they use the guy from the original Bionic Commando ? The graphics look pretty good, with lots of colors though, so that's at least one positive thing. The game itself can be finished in 4 hours. But if you look for collectibles and finishing challenges, it can be twice that. So... if you have nothing else to play, go play this.\n\n[Rating: 65/100]","June 12, 2011","true","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Has pleasant graphics and solid smooth gameplay. The sound is good and the music is not bad. I wish I would have payed more attention to this when it came out in 2009 because I am having a good time playing it. Well mostly. The grappling swinging controls are not as awesome as a lot of user reviews would lead you to believe, but they are competent. The problem being that swing points are usually too close together making consistent swinging very awkward to do. It is also very hard to gauge when to release to swing outward correctly even though it shows you a blue icon letting you know when. You still have to pinpoint release to swing even remotely how you want to, which leads to a lot of swinging straight up or at a upward angle, or too low, as opposed to straight forward or at a much desired but very hard to do forward upward angle to propel you forward correctly. The third person shooting aspect is forgettable especially since the only weapon you have in the game is a pistol, although you can find secondary weapons sometimes like a minigun which blows, or a grenade launcher which rocks. You can also punch objects into the air then jump up and punch them at your enemy, or you can latch your grapple onto an object and whip it into them, or you can grapple onto an enemy and jump kick them twice to kill them. You can use the jump kick move for a lot of your kills.\n\nSome parts are not very fun. Mainly the part I just got passed. It didn't make any sense but up until this point, about 4-5 hours into the game, everything was very easy, then all of a sudden I had to fight two robots and the difficulty spiked massively from a 2 to a 9 and they are not even bosses, just regular enemies. They are not exactly fun to fight until I just swung objects into them with swing grapple and on like my 5+ try I killed them.\n\nOverall it was a solid purchase. I think I payed $2.50 for it and at that price it was a very good deal. Do not pay more than $5 though because it is a pretty short game. 7/10","July 5, 2014","true","8.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I paid $5 for this and still have trouble finding any redeeming value in it. It's hard to even figure out where to start when it comes to the issues, but I think my first one would have to be the sheer difficulty of the game. Anything and *everything* can kill you...and exceedingly quickly. Walk to close to fire(not even touching it), and you're dead in less than a second. Enemy hits you with some sort of electrified stick, you're dead. Flying mech-thing shoots a missle that just kind of grazes you, you're dead. Add to it that you have only have a *pistol* 99.9% of the time with unbelievably limited ammo and you're left trying to punch these enemies to death. No joke, you're sitting there *punching* mechs. The swing mechanic, as you'll read in a lot of other reviews, is also hard to get used to. Why they couldn't just simply make it as easy as it was in the original NES(or remake) game, I have no idea. They took the single most important thing about Bionic Commando and turned it in to a frustrating guessing game of "when do I release?"...and, of course, when you miss it, you're dead most of the time. Add to it these weird "Radiation Zone" areas(basically invisible walls that cut you off from going too far off the pre-determined path) that sap your life away if you happen to go swinging in to one(most times dying before you can get back out) and you've got a game that basically punishes you in every conceivable gameplay area.

I would recommend it on an extreme sale, but overall (even for $10), I cannot.\n\nA slow start to a game, and certainly a slow start to a story. They did a decent job trying to keep the old Commando perks in the game (from sounds, clothes, and music), but for what they have, they could have upped the intensity of the situation. The story doesn't feel like it impacts the game what so ever.\n\nThe game overall is decent. The premise of it feels somewhat correct, and the bionic arm isn't as limiting as some reviewers say. Although be it so, the arm's momentum feels very stiff (maybe that's the way a machine arm is supposed to be) and the swing mechanic feels limiting. One would imagine themselves swinging all over the level, but in reality one can only go in the direction that is blatantly laid out in front of them. The distance the arm can be used is also a factor, as it is not very far. There is the capability of using melee, in which the coolest part is knocking an enemy near a ledge and watching their animation struggle not to fall. Problem is, it's quite bland and doesn't give the player any impression of an impact. The shooting is bland and literally feels like it was put together in seconds. You can zoom in for a better view, and yes there are different weapons (not really to choose from, rather wait for the proper drops throughout the levels), but shooting and fighting enemies feels like a grind. Enemies aim is quite well, and snipers will take you out if you stay motionless for at tops, three seconds. Spencer can use his bionic arm against enemies, but only to jump in the air once (press A), then zip towards the enemy (pressing A again). They could have done so much more with the arm but it seems they chose not to. They could have given it abilities, or a capability to throw an opponent. Nope, none of that is present here.\n\nA game that could have been that much more, just simply lacks. The multiplayer is alright at best, and probably won't keep you busy for too too long. The choppy-ness of the jumps and the difficulty of grabbing opponents with the arm just all feel flawed. It is nice however, that they did decide to include multiplayer. If you are going to make a game with guns and a bionic arm, maybe try to incorporate the two a little better, or at least try to combine the two. The graphics are alright, and the sounds are basic.\n\nDue to the reasons stated above, I simply cannot recommend it. Unless you are a complete die hard fan of Bionic Commando, is the only way I can say buy it... and even then on sale. It hurts me to rate this game instead of calling it acclaimed.\n\nRATING : 6.0/10\n\nScreenShots :\nWhat the zip-line system looks like\n\nI wish they paid as much attention to game play detail as they did for this animation (mentioned in review when melee-ing)\n\nSend your opponents flying with this new and improved bumping system!\n\nOne of the swinging mechanics.

It was a side scrolling masterpiece: innovative gameplay, epic level design and an actual storyline.The kid in me was trembling with expectation when I started playing this 3D sequel.\n\nAlthough I was annoyed by the many modern gaming sins: no health bar, mandatory/not always well placed checkpoints (now that just added 5h of replaying through parts of levels thank you), invisible level barriers (radiation and water) and etc...Still, I was literally hooked, in part because I was curious to see what's next: the environments are lush even if the level design is either repetitive or slightly inconsistent (often too hard or too easy). By adding more realistic FPS gunplay Grin took away some of the fun of shooting bullets and chasing them while swinging with your arm, in fact shooting and swinging simultaneously is never really required so you're either playing 'Prince of Persia' jumping and flying around or 'Splinter Cell' shooting guards in buildings over the shoulder. The only two cool gameplay mechanics are the dive bomb (death from above) and the abilities to throw objects (even cars and billboards) but Spencer's a total wimp as a couple strong shots will take him down most of the time and even near the end of the game he has limited abilities and a small arsenal (only 4 classic guns). And as the controls are far from perfect (specially for precision swinging) you will die abundantly.\n\nThere are some epic moments like the boss fights, but all in all this feels for fans only, the amount of pleasure to be derived from this mechanical arm is somewhat inferior to the pain. But if you wanna find out why the hell Spencer has dreadlocks this is the game for you!\n\nPS: Haven't managed to log on to online MP so I assume it's dead.\nPPS: There are no graphic options or full controller support.","July 15, 2015","true","21.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The swinging mechanic is arguably one of the most fun to play with. Unfortunately, the oodles of stale combat shoehorned into the mix become increasingly tiresome, along with the hodge-podge placement of somewhat invisible death barriers along the intended, linear pathway. While I can say that the PC version is probably the best version of this game having played the PS3 version, it's still pretty awful. I had to quit shortly after the second boss (and even passing that was an achievement) because the game design choices moving forward just became increasingly tedious and instead of allowing the player to enjoy the experience, rather chose to punish them with clunky controls and underpowered weaponry. Overall, I'd say avoid it unless it's on sale for like $2.50 and you REALLY have a hankering for a bad time.","January 17, 2015","false","4.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The graphics are the best part of the game, which isnt saying allot, but the animation, controls and physics are ridiculously bad. Under no circumstances should anyone ever buy this game. Remember how frustrating the NES game could become, this is that times 1000. They could have made a great game but instead they decided to make the controls so bad and laggy that just trying to swing from one beam to another is a test of your patience. Once you're locked on to a beam, rather than having to swing back and forth building momentum the guy goes from 0 to 100 instantly. That isnt so bad except if you want to have forward moentum after you release you must do it a good 2 seconds earlier than it appears you should because the character wont release when you release the button. The combination of these two things makes knowing when to let go and how far your character will go once you release impossible to know for sure. I eventually grew to like the NES game because of it's dificulty, but this game is just maddening because of how they created that dificulty. If the dificulty was a result of the environments and enemies that would be fine, but the difficulty comes from the horrible controls, impossible physics and crappy character animation. The enemy AI is awful as well, they just huddle into groups so you can just mow them down in a line. The story is preposterously awful and the voice acting is so bad it makes the cut scenes unwatchable.","August 25, 2015","false","1.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

First, there are not that many different types of enemies.  There are about three or four varieties of humans and about the same number for mechanical baddies.  Second, there is a bit of a learning curve for grappling, one of the main components to the game.  Be prepared to fall to your death a lot.  Third, while I appreciated the challenge system in the game, there's really no point that I found to collectibles.  Many of the collectibles are very hard to reach and if you die before getting to a checkpoint, you have to go back to get the darned things again.  I made it a ways through the game before the issue of repetition was finally enough for me to uninstall.","October 28, 2014","false","5.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I mean it is ♥♥♥♥ing bionic commando, he was so badass and cool. but then this game was a ♥♥♥♥ up. the tutorial makes zero sence to the player because you are expected to play with a ♥♥♥♥ing xbox controller. so it took me an hour to do the tutorial but how was the actual gameplay. well i thought that the wire swinging would be so much fun, but the timing for the wire was so weird that the game knew it and did not even bother to change it. the main game mechanic of wire swinging was ♥♥♥♥ed up beyond beleif they they put a signal when to let go of the wire button. The AI is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid and all they do is aimbot you and gang up on you. the main reason you die in this game is the "radiation". the radiation ♥♥♥♥s with your mechanical arm and kill you within 3 seconds of standing in it. the only reason radiation is in this game is to prevent the player from going to explore and look around. they used the radiation to kill the player for going out of bounds. The radiation works sometimes and sometimes it does not. i found areas were i could walk on radiation and out of bounds. they were lazy with this game , honestly. they should have made this game open world if the wire swinging mechanic is such a big part of the game. this would have been a more badass spiderman game. but this game has issues, yes u cannot say that it does not. But even though this game is flawed, the ideas were amazing. one hand shoots, the bionic arm can grapple, throw and light and heavy punch. over all i give this game a 6/10 because of it's  lazy game design and radiation boundries.\n\nEdit:\n\nI actually sold this game because it was so bad, like i couldent even have fun with this piece of sh!t","May 15, 2015","false","1.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Yet developers are too stupid to release games on PC first before dumbing down the quality so consoles can play it. Instead they have to port the console quality games BACK ONTO PC with even worse quality...like what are you idiots thinking!?\nIs it really because of piracy? I'm sorry but any game, even on consoles can be hacked/pirated it's not only PC so go f*** yourself.\nAnyways, because of these beautiful console ports, we get a game like this (others including Bioshock Infinite, ALL the Grand Theft Auto's, Castle Crashers, Poorly Made Games etc.) where even though it's on PC they tell you the how to play using the f****** buttons on the CONTROLLER! No I'm using a god damned keyboard, these developers are too damn lazy to cut out the use of informing me that X,Y,A,B,LT,RT are to be used when I enabled A KEYBOARD!\nNow I'm not dissing the game, I think it's a decent game. Just the fact the information I receive is for console/controller players only frustrates me.\n\nThe game itself reminds me of Bioshock Infinite and Rachet & Clank with the use of a grappling hook, as well as Max Payne and Just Cause 2 with the third person open shooter game.\nI like the story, and the characters, it's definately better than the Bionic Command Rearmed crap they made before, but it's still an uninteresting game, it's challenging yes but there's nothing in the game that interests me to make me play it continously so I gave up.\n\n4/10","November 2, 2014","false","1.9"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","0"

That being said, I was recommended by Gameradar and that's how I got into the game.\n\nFirst thing first, yes..... the story for this game sucks. It sucks not because it's was badly written but rather the tone of the game is taken too serious. The game is literally too moody compare to the tongue and cheek of the 2d version and Spenser was taken too serious and angry to be a good protagonist (also he has dreads compare to his awesome redhead and specs, what the hell was up with that?). The game is also plagued with pretty bad twist including the famous "Wife = Arm".\n\nSo why am I recommending this game if the story suck. 1 word: Gameplay. The Bionic Arm is one of the most awesome thing to ever exist. LIterally it is both a forum of movement and combat weapon. you will never have so much fun with flinging enemies at other people while also swinging across the map. Another bonus that the game gets is that the music is fantastic, one of my favorite soundtracks I've heard. It's already a traditions to have badass music in a bionic commando game, and this is no exception.\n\nAt any time this game is on sale or during the final days of a major sell, I recommend you get this game","July 14, 2014","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SFDvus/recommended/21670/","SFDvus","SFDvus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SFDvus/","250 products in account","Bionic Commando is like having bacon in between two pieces of raw potato. Yea bacon is good and ya you can have it on its own but now its in between this uncooked potato. Yea you can eat it and the bacon will be there but in general is just ruined by this raw potato. Thats what it felt like playing bionic commando. The game is developed and published capcom with some help from grin a company known for such great games as wanted weapons of fate and terminator salvation. So if the games that came before and after bionic commando are to speak for the quality you should think about dropping your expectations but even if you do the game soil itself right of the bat by dropping you in, locked up in chains. You don't know why then some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bag sets you free just to tell you ay sorry we locked you up for 5 years but we need you to work for us now and we know about your missing wife so ♥♥♥♥ off. Woah I really want to save the world now. After the kick in the balls of an intro the game drops you into the mission with one arm and just a standard pistol and tells you to get your other arm. Thats simple alright only problem is the movement is clunky just walking around, you have a dodge that takes at least 4 seconds to do and gets you nowhere Its more of a harm to do it. so getting to your arm with around 10 enemies on the path is pretty ♥♥♥♥ when you die in 3 hits, get used to that because there are no health ups to my knowledge. Once you beat everyone and get your are the game opens up in a big way in terms of movement.  You get ability to grapple to walls and pull yourself in or swing if you have the moment. THIS  and only THIS is a redeemable factor in this whole game. Crippled by a bad story, bad level design, and bad combat the only thing that got me through this 6 hour long campaign was some of the cool stuff I can do with the swing. Heres where I direct you back to my potato/bacon comparison. if you want to bite through all the bad potato, chew it up, and swallow it.  Just to get a taste of the good bacon then maybe this game is for you. I have to admit these are some of the best feeling grappling and swinging mechanics I felt in a long time and makes we question why grappling hooks are not in every game. The movement and feel of the swing is great only problem is the bad level design and combat get in the way of just having fun with it and in some point it just gets frustrating trying to fight it so U end up just walking. like the areas where you can actually do some cool stuff, 70% of it is covered in this blue gas you can't go in or youll die and you cant even go to high in the air or youll die its like old spiderman games in that sense. its sad when games from 2003 innovate more than games only 5 years old  but overall I feel the grappling is good enough to carry you through this game if you like that kind of thing. the rest of the game is pretty bad 5/10\nCapcom's devs said that working with grin was “messed up” so i can see how some parts of the game are good but the rest are just ruined.  Grins track record is pretty sad when I looked at it. they made wanted wof, bionic commando, and terminator in 2009 but after that seems every game they were scheduled to make was canceled including a unnamed strider reboot, a unnamed street of rage remake and 3 other games. turns out they filed for bankruptcy at the end of 2009 due to lack of funds from publishers. would of been nice to see those games but looking at their past maybe this is for the best.\nSFDvus cya guys","September 18, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Character is some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with dredlocks and a mongaloid forhead, who sits around complaining and being butthurt the entire time, while your superiors you are helping just yell at you and do nonsense things that make no sense. Story has super predictable twist, and then a different super dumb one that people know if they have read PCG mag or any gaming outlet. The graphics are fine. Level design sucks and is too linear, with radiation being invisible walls that keep you from getting to use your arm as much as you want. Speaking of arm, it lets you do some cool abilities, but swinging could be better. Its super finnicky, and you have to release it way earlier than makes sense. You will constantly try to grab for an enemy and it will grab right below them. Also you can't tell if you'll be able to reach something when you jump or swing to something else, and it seems the hand is super short.\nSpencer is a ♥♥♥♥♥ that dies in like 4 shots, so you can't get close much in groups to actually use your arm. This means you have to use the boring gunplay. You are forced to use a pistol as your main gun, and it has the impact and sound of a rubber band gun, without the fun of loading it. You get a few other guns you have to switch out between having, but ammo is super scarce and they are boring and unoriginal. At least he finally figured out how to look up and down and jump, only took him 25 years to learn how to properly function in an action adventure.\nSometimes swinging can be fun and work out. The collectibles are worthless. 7/10.","March 30, 2015","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That being said, I was recommended by Gameradar and that's how I got into the game.\n\nFirst thing first, yes..... the story for this game sucks. It sucks not because it's was badly written but rather the tone of the game is taken too serious. The game is literally too moody compare to the tongue and cheek of the 2d version and Spenser was taken too serious and angry to be a good protagonist (also he has dreads compare to his awesome redhead and specs, what the hell was up with that?). The game is also plagued with pretty bad twist including the famous "Wife = Arm".\n\nSo why am I recommending this game if the story suck. 1 word: Gameplay. The Bionic Arm is one of the most awesome thing to ever exist. LIterally it is both a forum of movement and combat weapon. you will never have so much fun with flinging enemies at other people while also swinging across the map. Another bonus that the game gets is that the music is fantastic, one of my favorite soundtracks I've heard. It's already a traditions to have badass music in a bionic commando game, and this is no exception.\n\nAt any time this game is on sale or during the final days of a major sell, I recommend you get this game","July 14, 2014","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(x360ce needed for not-microsoft gamepad users, pm me if you need help)\n- The game is not easy, but is not Dark Souls hard either. But it surely needs some ability with the controls. Though that is exactly the fun in my opinion. It has the old times arcade spirit, because:\n--- If you die, you go back 5-10min play, and lost all collectibles gathered.\n--- You may die easily if not aware and skilled.\n--- This makes the game challenger and rewarding.\n- The graphics are great for a game from its release date\n--- But there's NO CUSTOMIZATION at all. (NVIDIA users may be able to change it be NVIDIA control panel, the looks great after this, really great).\n- The multiplayer function IS A LIE. The server is off.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sirhic/recommended/21670/","Sirhic","Sirhic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sirhic/","153 products in account","I bought and played this game the day it was released for Xbox 360, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Recently bought it on sale, and decided I would try it again, years later, to see if my opinion still holds. It does. (In depth below, skip to the end for final opinion).\n\nAt it's core, the game is an excellent 3D translation of the classic Bionic Commando and remake Rearmed gameplay.  The swing mechanics, while it can take some getting used to, feel precise, even when you screw up using them (getting wrapped around a light pole you have attached the arm trying to swing at an odd angle).  The arm mechanics are adapted well to combat, giving the player many options beyond a gun to kill enemies. Many of these arm combat mechanics were adapted to Rearmed 2, released a year or 2 later. Throwing things with the arm, for me on the PC, did leave something to desire, as it seemed perfectly open throws would fly backwards instead of forward. The weapons part of the combat is pretty typical for a third-person shooter, with the addition of being able to shoot while swinging.\n\nBeyond that, however, is where the game becomes a matter of taste.\n\nThe level design is similar to previous installments; mostly-linear levels confining the player to the beaten path (not unlike other modern 3D shooters).  Unlike many 3D linear games, the area boundaries aren't solid.  They consist of radiation which the player only has a few seconds to leave before it kills them, or water in which the player has a few seconds to use the bionic arm to escape before drowning (lenient considering most games, and previous installments, killed the player instantly for entering water).  I thought the level design is fine, conveying the developers' intent to have the player roam through the city completing missions for the government.\n\nGame progression is slow relative to the length of the game itself, and the pacing of the game is terrible.  By the time the player unlocks all arm abilities earned through game progression, the game is over halfway finished.  And the game itself is too short, probably a good 2-4 hour experience from start to finish depending.  The game needed at least another major section.\n\nThe story, while quirky and excessively profane, left a lot of things to be desired. And the soundtrack, while I quite enjoy it, doesn't have much variety.  I would say about half of the soundtrack is either a loose remix, or uses several parts, of the first level theme from the original Bionic Commando/Rearmed.\n\nIn the end though, the game is worth the current price ($10), and definitely any sale price.  Ignoring the story, the slow start to the gameplay picks up greatly about a third of the way through the game and you'll be flying around full speed about halfway through.  Combat is simple, and the arm and swinging opens up a variety of ways to destroy the enemy, which doesn't get old.\n\nPick it up, don't take it too seriously, and it should be a good time.","June 10, 2015","true","28.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a sequel to Bionic Commando Rearmed and the story continues off from there, placing the player in charge of Nathan Spencer.\n\nStory: The game has a cliched story about a soldier seeking revenge after some people do him wrong. The characters aren't all that interesting and the voice acting in general is pretty mediocre, especially in Nathan Spencer's case. My god does he have an annoying and unlikable voice.\n\nGraphics: The graphics for Bionic Commando are passable, just good enough to justify being in the PS3/Xbox 360 era. The game is in HD and the character models and environments are crisp, but don't expecting breathtaking graphics like Uncharted 2.\n\nGameplay: This is where Bionic Commando shines. It is a lot of fun to zip around obstacles and the environments using Spencer's bionic arm. It is also very tricky at times to get around, as the control system can be a bit finicky and you might lose track of where you are (using the bionic arm can be very tricking when swinging and grappling onto balloons).\n\nOverall, Bionic Commando is an enjoyable game that may not win any awards but is worth your time and money. It is definitely too harshly criticized and is by no means a bad game.\n\nI'd give it a 7/10.","June 13, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, the story is not so great and it's a bit linear but if you're looking for a good action/adventure game with fun combats this is still a great game. Also, unlike a lot of games that just try to copy what worked well with other AAA titles, this games adds new elements that differentiates it from the rest. The bionic arm is really great and add a new dimension to the game.","June 10, 2015","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These are kind of crude, and kill you within a second of two sending you back to the checkpoint which is hella frustrating.\n\nOverall:\nFun game, a solid 7/10 if you aren't looking for anything too serious or detailed.\n\nEdit: Just finished the game, it is incredibly short.

They give you back your bionic arm and send you loose to go kill some dudes. In return they will give you information about the location of your girly poo. End of plot and that's ok. The games more interesting aspect in dialogue/plot is just purely how much of a 90's action flick it is.\n\nThe Good\nThe combat feels solid enough without feeling like you are god incarnate killing everybody. The grappling arm feels great as you go swinging around like spider man with a machine gun. The humor is spot on and the game doesn't take itself to seriously.\n\nThe Bad\nThe game feels very linear do to the radiation. Honestly I wanted to explore this game and swing around everywhere and the game just wouldn't let me feel free to do what I wanted. The graphics are somewhat cartoonish and I don't think it was supposed to. The enemies even on normal have absurd accuracy from large distances that you can't hit the broad side of a barn at. The guns and gameplay feels relatively dated even for when it was released.\n\nConclusion\nHonestly it's the radiation that made me hate this game. I liked how everything was going at first and then bam dead... Guess I can't go that way lets try going over here... Bam dead. That coupled with enemies hitting me perfectly from distances I could hit them at just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. If you can get passed those two major problems I'd say have at it. The ideas were great and the implementation was mostly ok, but at the end of the day those two things just wrecked it for me.\n\nValue\nIf you want to give it a try I'd do so at a max of $2.50","May 24, 2015","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Megamatics/recommended/21670/","Megamatics","Optimus_Mega","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Megamatics/","212 products in account","This game has some prettyminor issues; but they became glaring problems when you need them to work perfectly to survive in Hardmode. I was already inundated with knowledge of how to play the game when I played the demo way back when this was first set to launch. I had a lot of fun; but I ultimately was not financially set enough to just buy the games I wanted at the time. Fast-forward to 2016, and I find myself buying the Humble Bundle containing this game as a bonus. Naturally I picked to play the game on Hardmode, since I already know how to play the game pretty well. I was hoping the game would give a decent challenge, and I feel much of that expectation has been met.\n\nTo refresh myself with the games controls, I took care to pay close attention to the Tutorial. Swinging, Throwing, Ripping, Heavy Uppercut Launching, and Shooting were the main subjects covered in it. To my dismay, I would find out during the actual game that I wouldn't be able to use these skills until I reached a point in the game where it would be important to progression. This of course made enemies more difficult than they should of been when I didn't have the tools I had learned to use in the Tutorial. It's one of the few negative about this game; but it's not really gamebreaking. Not being able to throw items at the first biomechs was just annoying, I was forced to use Handgrenades or rely on luck in hitting their back hatch with the pistol(as there was not enough ammo in the bonus weapon they drop for you to use).\n\nThis game makes good use of Bonuses, Challenges, and Hidden Retro Icons. You're never really left that often with an empty area; although the Retro Icons are never hidden that well. They're more or less sprawled out to challenge your swinging ability. This isn't really handled well since dying means you have to get everything you got before the next Checkpoint. I don't really have an issue with this; but It was annoying to have to rewatch certain cutscenes or grab collectibles all over again. I found myself skipping things I had already done upon dying, to save myself the sanity of fighting that extra mobs of enemies again.\n\nAfter fumbling a bit with the controls, I managed to learn of a very unique way in taking down the Biomechs. There is some deep meta with this game in regards to enemy ventilating; but sadly there isn't much variety in enemies to explore. The trimming of this unrefined depth to gameplay; was most likely for thesake of the tacked on multiplayer. This game came out right around the time Multiplayer games were being churned out left and right, so single player experiences were routinely hampered by the need to substantiate XBL subscription costs. Too bad they couldn't just work on the Single Player more, a great deal of time had obviously gone into making the swinging feel so good; but the limitations in regards to invisible walls(Death Radiators), Sparse selection in weapons, and overall underwhelming-swiftness to the plot, brings down the rest of the lasting appeal.\n\nTo tie it all together, it's not a bad game; but its way too quickly snapped together with lots of underwhelming bits, creating a very desultory feel to the game. Swinging, Fighting Enemies, and stealthly navigating the scenary, make the experience all the more fun. Perhaps multiplayer could be fun as well; but I'm not really interested in multiplayer games. Had this game poured it's heart into the Single player, it would be much better than it is. In the current day, this is probably the last we'll ever see of another Bionic Commando game; but I really hope there comes a time where the idea is explored again.","May 19","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Flinging around from building to building, whipping enemies into the air and slamming down from above like a meteor is all pretty awesome. Unfortunately, it's held back by some questionable design decisions, and a general lack of diversity.\n\nWould I recommend it? For it's current low price, it's worth a go if you're curious. But once the novelty of the bionic arm wears off, the rest of the game isn't strong enough to carry on with the show.","May 25","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is pretty samey to a lot of other story: There's a macguffin you need to get, your characters a bitter hardass while mission control snarks at you and you need to complete your mission against an army of Not-Nazis and save the world. Of course that's not EXACTLY the story but that's what I felt as a good summary. Spencer comes off as an ♥♥♥ compared to his radical self in the original and Rearmed (with good reason but still) and Super Joe shows up but he's an ♥♥♥ as well. The entire universe of Bionic Commando got a lot grittier in this one, and while it's not a huge deal for me, when I keep hearing swearing during gameplay I get the feeling it's trying too hard to be mature rather than just letting it come out on its own.\n\nThe gameplay it rather abstract but nice. Swinging around feels pretty good (though it says ♥♥♥♥ you physics) and you can grab onto almost anything you can think of on the environment and using your arm to pull off throws and impressive feats makes you feel like a badass while Spencer hoops and hollers like a madman. Gunplay is pretty meh, you have your pistol which you will be using most of the time, it's somewhat reliable but it god it eats through ammo, you also get a special weapon that can be swapped out and grenades, but good luck keeping a special weapon you like, because special weapon pick-ups are rare as hell. Also using the throwing technique is a bit add because after kiting, throwing leads to items being flung in a very odd and nonsensical angle before being throw which leads to odd situations (like a mook flying off to the right before stopping for a split second and zipping the other way to hit the thing you wanted to hit). Combat in general is kinda nice but I've come to realize 3 things about it\n\n1.Your Bionic arm is your best friend. Seriously by late game I only used my weapons to take care of Biomechs quickly or when I had to shoot someone on the double. Throwing OP\n2. Spencer cannot take a hit worth a damn in this game, but nothing's stopping from swinging to safety and healing up like a ♥♥♥♥♥, which kind of takes away from the momentum of gameplay if you ask me.\n3. Biomechs can go to hell, because they're annoying as hell and they WILL swarm you by lategame. Also aiming at their weakspot can easily lead to Spencer shooting his arm at a barrel right beside them as much as their back which leads to much frustration\n\nAlso another major issue I have with the game is that it railroads you hard. What I mean by that is that you'd expect to be able to swing around and enjoy yourself and your mobility taking out bad guys however you see fit. However, you can't as radiation has covered the city and the very second you hit an area with radioactivity, you only have a few seconds before you're dead. This gets ridiculous as you're swinging around avoiding gunfire or looking for collectibles (which do very little from what I've seen) and then all of a sudden you hear a blaring warning signal before Spencer flops over dead taking you back to a checkpoint. Speaking of which when you die, you go back and all your progress (objectives, ammo, and collectibles) are gone and you have to get them all bad.\n\nThe ending is screwy and while I won't spoil it, I feel like it was just a waste of potential of what could have been an amazing final boss.\n\nOverall, give it a shot if you find this on sale, but it is a hit and miss game. It's not horrid but you can easily hate it as much as you like it. Just be warned that this PC port is lackluster compared to other ports and is rather lazy, it's crashed twice over the course of the game for me, has no windowed options or even any graphics settings so if you have a low-end computer you probably won't be able to play this.","May 28","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
