Swap the tile you're given with any on the board to make groupings of 4 or more to damage your foes before they damage you! Get money and catnip to spend on upgrades and new ships and weapon power-ups to help you hit harder and faster to get more stars at the end of each level in order to progress.\n\nSound: Retro but a little repetitive. What you hear in the trailer is what you get. Nothing obnoxious, but nothing spectacular either. You can turn on or off sounds or music but that's it.\n\nControls: It's obviously meant for mobile as some things mention tapping. But it's all mouse from here, baby! Nothing simpler than that.\n\nGraphics: Pixels! Pixels everywhere! Except for the strangely large space behind the gameplay area which is just filled with cute cat and fish drawings. You can window the game (alt+enter) or full screen it, but it seems to always only have this tiny gameplay screen inside a giant window with the doodled background. Obviously remnants from its mobile origin.\n\nStory: Yes, there is actually a story, again, shown in the trailer. Funny and cute; steal back the cat island's catnip from the Aquarium Alliance, beating one fish into submission at a time!\n\nOverall: I'm having fun; there's a nice amount of achievements for how short the game is so it ups the replay value a little with that, and there are plenty of different ships to unlock, too. My only concern is the lack of resolution choices but it's not a must for such a little game as this, in my opinion, so I can stick it out. On launch there were a few bugs including no sound, but the Developer handled it almost immediately. I recommend this game; the price is nice for what you're getting.","June 27, 2015","true","12.1"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","25","26","6","0"

Upon launching the game I was surprised at the level of violence which the cats are exposed to, these violent fish and other hooligans seem to, without reasoning, use advanced machinery to attack these cats.\nI also question the morals of this game as when taking down the evil fish the cats are rewarded with weed (named catnip) which they can exchange for new ships or upgrading current stats.\n\nOverall 10/10 I like the cats.","June 27, 2015","true","0.6"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","83","29","35","28","0"

Yes it sounds dumb but the game is fun. :)\n\nThe mechanics are simple. There are 6 types of gems on a 6x6 table and you have to put 4 or more similar next to each other to release the effect belong to them. Have to use 4 types of attack, can repair yourself and get money which can be spent on upgrades. Upgrades make the effects stronger.\n\nI finished the campaign between 2 and 3 hours.

I don't think any of us want to know what kind of extreme measures they had to undergo to get their paws on just one more leaf. Adding in a twist of addiction gives the characters a real reason to fight and be so heroic in battle. Not to mention the tension between the malicious Aquarium Alliance and the valiant brigade of ferocious felines was absolutely fascinating yet incredible. I also enjoyed the cameo appearances from all my favorite cat memes. Including nyan cat, grumpy cat, even the one with the melon on it's head!\n\n\nI rated this game   9.9 balls of yarn out of 10.\n(-.1 for the lack of a much needed multiplayer mode)","December 28, 2015","true","1.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","7","7","5","0"

Though it feels like the map runs out before the gameplay does, in my opinion another 3/4 stars on the map to battle for near the boss would improve the endgame in many ways.\n\n\n"Man, I know how much Cats dig their nippy, there was "high" insentive to get the stash back!"","June 30, 2015","true","8.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/350610/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","I never quite knew what I was getting myself into with Combat Cats. I didn’t actively seek out to feature the game. I only agreed to feature it as part of our KISS Gameathon as a favor for my representative at KISS whose friend developed this game. Now that I have got you thinking that I’m making excuses for featuring the game I’d like you to stop those thoughts. Sometimes games slip under the radar. I mean completely under the radar. The game was released in March of last year and went unnoticed to the point that it doesn’t even have a page on Metacritic let alone reviews for it on the site. Those who count total Steam reviews there’s 21 in total.\n\nI am more than a little bit shocked that it has gone under the radar as much as it has. The match gems genre, which is essentially a large part of the game, generally has been one that has fans who pick up the vast majority of its games when it is release. The game is just $2.99 so price has never been an issue. The devs seemingly had to argue with Steam to put the game out at a price that they deemed fair – Steam wanted a higher price and a threat was made that the game would be released as a free to play title if Steam disagreed with the final price point that the game was slated at. This is something that I have never seen before. However, Steam requesting that their cut (30% of each and every product sold through Steam itself) be something significant doesn’t surprise me in the least. That’s why Steamified hopes to open our own game shop later in the year but that’s a discussion topic for another time.\n\nThere’s a high level of challenge present in Combat Cats. Some of the achievements are among most challenging and rewarding to get. There are 25 in total and although the game was only intended to be a short one if you’re an achievement hunter who refuses to use SAM (Steam Achievement Manager) to boost your stats you will find that it will take you a good while to get them all. From that perspective the game has a lot of replayability but that is determined on how much you enjoy the genre as to whether you’ll spend that time with the game. There are fifteen different levels and the game utilizes the three star system.\n\nCombat Cats is visually and audibly suffice for what it needs to achieve. It’s not going to be memorable in either way but it wont make your ears or eyes hurt either. It just adds to make Combat Cats what it is – a very solid game and a good entry in the genre. It’s not the flashiest of games but it doesn’t have to be either. I hope that by providing some much needed spotlight on the game that Steamified has been able to raise some awareness of the game. And if you love cats and haven’t played it yet then go and purr-chase the game already!\n\nAt least give the game a bloody page on Metacritic for crying out loud!\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways visit http://www.steamified.com/\nFeel free to join our Steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified","February 29","true","2.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

You can then use the gold and catnip you earn to upgrade your plane and unlock other kitty pilots, each with their very own plane. Even with the gold and catnip collecting giving the game some padding, unfortunatly the game is rather on the short side and will only take a few hours to go through.\n\nIf you cannot get enough of these matching games Combat Cats is worth picking up.","July 28, 2015","true","4.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

When I only have a few minutes to spare, I still go back and play it every once and a while despite finishing it.\n\nYou can probably cruise through it in 3-4 hours, if you just push for completion and ignore collection and achievements.\n\nI liked the idea of earning earning catnip (The leaves?) and money to buy things and upgrade ability.  Keeps it interesting.\n\nMoney was weighted quite well relative to the length of game.  This means you don't grind too much, but it takes a decent time to get the cash.\n\nCatnip was poorly weighted.  You end up topping out too quickly to where it does not matter.\n\nThe level progression was weighted quite well.  You did not have to grind too much to get the items you need to stand a chance on the next level.  In other words the abilities of the next level up were well matched to the powers and ships you have by the time you get there.  This makes it a fair fight, without too much boredom and frustration.\n\nTwo of the achievements to do with survival mode are extremely hard to do.  They are unrealistic compared to other achievements.  It does not have an enemies killed tracker so you can see how close you got, instead it has a useless points tracker.\n\nSurvival mode is kind of lame since there are not any upgrades you can do.  Once you complete the quest likely you have everything.  So you go to survival mode and basically keep getting to the same point of progress.  Since you have everything it makes catnip and money meaningless.  It would have been cool to add a new set of weapons and abilities for survival mode after the quest is complete.\n\nAs it is survival mode is kind of pointless.","November 26, 2015","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
