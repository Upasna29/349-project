Games of this genre are often a hit from the start or just flop straight away. Unfortunately Better Late Than DEAD does not have a very bright future in my eyes.\n\nGameplay is…well, almost none existent. I started out in the ocean and had to swim at least five minutes before I got to any sort of land. I spent almost an hour exploring the island, finding a couple of houses, and that is it. Whilst exploring the houses I found that each of them had their own loot, strangely enough, the houses were all an exact copy of each other and the loot was spawned in exactly the same place.  The loot that I found were again, everything you would expect to find in this type of game, cans of food, bandages, knives, etc. As far as game play goes, that is it. There is absolutely nothing else to do in this game; I didn’t find any animals, enemies, nothing.\n\nThe graphics are bad to say the least; the screenshots really shows the game in a different light to how it actually looks in real time. Awfully low quality textures on almost everything, the water certainly doesn’t look like how it does in the screenshots, and neither does the skybox. On top of the poor graphics, the animation side of the game is horrible; your character has just an awful run cycle that looks like some sort of jelly man was used to rig it – also this game features possibly one of the highest jumping ability I have ever seen in a game, I swear I was jumping up entire flights of stairs in one go… It should also be known, that from jumping, I managed to break my leg in the game twice and die from it once – lord knows how.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, I was presented with a cut scene that sets up for a quite interesting story; but that is it. After that intro, I found no other plot elements, or anything. I was particularly disappointed as I would have really liked to have seen more of it. Hopefully the developers will be adding something in via patches in the future on this aspect.\n\nBetter Late Than DEAD also has some audio problems. Whilst playing the game, you will have the same repetitive soundtrack playing in the background, and when it loops, boy do you notice it. There is an obvious cut in the track, and it just starts playing again; this for me seemed like a really basic issue which should not be seen in the game, it really ruined the game’s immersion (the little it actually had).\n\nI really expected the world I was in to be full of interesting environments and buildings to explore, but sadly due to the copy/paste nature shown in the game, it all seemed to blur together and nothing really stood out as interesting. All of the buildings are exactly the same layout, tress look exactly the same, it just looks like someone has gone in and press CTRL A CTRL V over and over again to make it seem like the world is huge.\n\nSadly the game is very poorly optimized. Whilst the game has the options to run on all resolutions up to 4k, it certainly doesn’t run well. Playability is none existent at 4k, so I had to drop it to 1080p, and even then, I was not able to reach 60 fps and that is with my monster rig.  This needs to be the top of their agenda at the very least.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, I have been playing for just over two hours; I honestly don’t see myself jumping into the game any time again soon, unless there are some major changes and improvements on what the game currently has. The last update to the game from what I can see is 18th November 2015, and even then, only two new additions to the game were added.  If anyone is interested in the survival genre, there are definitely games out there that are still in early access, and are in a much much better state than this game at the moment. Even though the game is retailing for £6,99, I still cannot recommend this game. It may improve, but it is going to take a lot for it to be even worthy of that low price.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

For those familiar with survival games, BLTD is the quintessential example - but with too many flaws currently to rationalize the price.\n\nBTLD is a game of too many button presses. In most games, you could press E or F to pick up a nearby item. In BTLD you must right-click to zoom in (on an already slightly off camera angle, another thing that bothered me), pan over to the item in question with a slightly unreasonable amount of exactness, and left click.\nThe inventory systems mirrors this as well. Clicking an item current brings up a context menu, but the only options currently are to drop or equip something. This means that all food, water, bandages, etc must be used from the quickbar, when in many cases it could be more easily used straight from the inventory. This issue is exaserbated by the fact that there are only 4(?!) quickbar slots. Eating a mango should be a quick trip to the inventory, but it is instead a matter of equipping it, activating it, and THEN eating it. Pressing the relevant quickbar key doesn't automatically activate, you must click another time before watching your character enter into an awkward eating animation.\n\nSpeaking of animations, that is another thing this game does poorly from what I saw. The character runs in a very goofy fashion, especially if he becomes injured. Injury seems to be incurred too easily - I walked for several in-game hours on a broken ankle or whatever caused by jumping off a rock that didn't come up to the character's knees.\n\nLastly, the character model is pretty ugly. His beard doesn't look even the least bit natural, and neither does his butt. It seriously looks like the left side is twice the side of his right, which is made worse by the aforementioned running animation. You're probably thinking, "I could seriously care less about this character's butt", but lemme tell you, you'll be looking at it for the majority of your time playing BLTD.","July 26, 2015","false","0.3"," 252 of 319 people (79%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","79","252","319","26","11"

I start off stranded in the middle of nowhere (game off to an intruguing start) unfortunately the controls are terrible and the inventory layout is horrid.\n\n2. The game mechanics don't work, switching different perspectives are very difficult, as to when you try to switch from 3rd to 1st, your viewing capabilities might be limited for a temporary amount of time.\n\n3. The ambience is quite pleasent, as the creators of the game are trying to give the game a mysterious feel to it, but unfortunately the music changes so abruptly as you scavenge through different villages and forests.\n\n4. The creatures that I have experienced were a bear and a wolf, which both can scare the living ♥♥♥♥ out of you if you are not familiar of your surroundings and get scared easily.\n\n5. The graphics are somewhat decent, but the motion blur is so ♥♥♥♥ing terrible that I need to get my eyes checked after I tried it.\n\nOverall Conclusion: I really do not think that you should get this game in its early stages because you will definitely regret buying it at the moment. I hope that the creators fix some of the music, sound effect and view perception bugs, which would definitely increase the gameplay and its value. But for now this game would be rated 4/10 and definitely would not buy for now.","September 20, 2015","false","0.5"," 113 of 149 people (76%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","76","113","149","18","0"

Don't worry you can eat it, as this is the main resource to get rid of your hunger bar, same for thirst.\n\nIt took me a while to figure out how to cut trees aswell, at first I thought trees were attacking me as soon as I started to hit them, little did I know I was actually cutting them, thus I got sticks. At this point I've already spend most of my time exploring and finding items which I can use to even collect these stick. (Note: Punching trees does not work, you can't punch, you will need an item of some sort.)\n\nThe borky sound/music that plays when you get near a village just annoys the f*ck out of me. If you turn your character around at some point it will just play over and over again.\n\nAnyway, I continued exploring in search for food, cause that felt like my entire main quest.\nI noticed a deer, awesome, flesh. So I chased it with an axe, untill the deer ran right through a wall and escaped.\n\nI stopped playing after I tried to craft a camp fire, like I couldn't even be bothered anymore at this point to even figure out how to get leaves.. since there is only 10% of the objects where you can get resources from.\n\nOk so to bundle this up:\n\nPros:\n- I actually liked the way how you were able to pick up items.\n- Sleeping works.\n\nCons:\n- Everything except you, can walk through walls.\n- Only 10% of the island can be used for resources.\n- Crafting, without using a wiki to even figure out where to get the resources.","May 1","false","0.7"," 51 of 60 people (85%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","85","51","60","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/combatwars/recommended/352950/","combatwars","CombatWars","http://steamcommunity.com/id/combatwars/","2032 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst thing I realized about this game...Massive mouse acceleration. From the instant you go into this game, you get slapped with that function. Lowering the mouse sensitivity doesn't change much.\n\nSecond, combat still needs a lot of work. Currently, I took on an alligator on a 1v1 match. Me with a knife, him or her with it's alligator skin and sharp teeth. I only lost about 30% of my health even though I was attacking it with a knife over the course of the fight. Apparently the wildlife flinches if you hit them so they don't attack you back. Who was the genius who implemented that? Anyways, when you're in combat and in the middle of doing an action, you can't really move your camera. So when your character swings a knife down and your prey(or enemy moves), you have to watch as your character moves back into position and then you can slowly swing your character towards the enemy again. But the most ♥♥♥♥ed up thing would be that a different alligator took me from the 70% health I was at to maybe around 5% with just one bite. I was running from a lake when I saw two alligators next to each other. I figured I would try skirting around them so to save some energy but one turns to me, nips me on my heel, and I nearly die. Freakin' unbelievable. I mean, choose one or the other. If you want to make them dangerous, take away the flinching wildlife so that they're a force to be reckoned with. If  you want this game to be easy, nerf their bite or something. Seriously, that ♥♥♥♥ was outrageous.\n\nOne thing that's interesting about this game is that it uses this perception concept that's very similar to Tomb Raider(2013) where you press a hotkey and then everything turns black and white for Lara other than things that she can interact with. Same concept for this game, except that it draws on your stamina for some reason. It's okay I guess, although it shows me things that I can't even interact with some times. For instance, I'm in a village and I'm running low on hydration and hunger. So use the perception ability and I see a water pump and a metal bowl filled with water. I walk over to it but nothing works. There's no interact key and I'm left staring at this bowl of water as my hydration meter slowly drops down. Why are the devs making it more complicated than it is? Why doesn't it allow me to drink out of the metal bowl of which the water is coming from an underground source? Do I honestly have to craft some sort of cup or bottle to drink water out of a pump?\n\nThe gameplay itself is somewhat lacking. I admit, I was introduced to the survival genre through Minecraft so the first thing I usually do is I go up to a tree and see what I can do to it. In this case, my character just grabs a tree and shakes it. I allow it to shake it a few more times until the game doesn't let me anymore and I'm left wondering what the hell is it trying to tell me to do. Now I haven't played long enough to completely put all the mechanisms down to pat, I've lost interest pretty quickly. Also, having to hold down right click just to interact with items in the world? Are you kidding me? It might sound like a petty complaint but until you've played and realized the absolute horror it is to navigate throughout a room with a ♥♥♥♥ ton of stuff on the ground, you won't understand the pain and agony I went through.\n\nLastly, I'm running a pretty powerful rig although it's not exactly the best(See my profile page for specs). Even so, I'm running this game on around 60FPS at max while sometimes it dips and stays around 40. Mind you, this is in 720p and the graphics look very subpar, especially during sunset. At sunset, it looks like all the props and assets were filtered with a weird bezel effect in photoshop.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=489541358\n\nUltimately, the game could use some more work. I do understand that it's Early Access and I do understand that its a fairly new release. But if I'm gonna be completely honest, this market is completely saturated with dozens of survival games where you need something that puts you apart from another. Currently, this feels extremely bland. Of course, the graphics looks somewhat better than some of the other survival games out there, but the gameplay falls short by miles.\n\nThumbs down for the current Early Access game although I'm fairly optimistic that it'll be improved in the near future.","July 27, 2015","false","0.4"," 83 of 137 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","83","137","4","12"

When this happens, a small circle appears on the screen and you must try to align it onto the item you want to interact with, but most of the times you will fail because by moving your mouse while the right button is pressed, you will move your camera view as well. The final result is a nightmare and it becomes literally ridicolous when the item you want to interact with, is moving in its turn (like the initial apples). Very often it happens that an interaction requires a lot more time (x10 in my opinion) than any other interaction offered by other titles (like Stranded Deep for example which is designed for being confortable because interactive objects reveal themselves as highlighted when you mouseover them). This is a real "basic" issue that in my opinion should be addressed with priority because it produces frustration. I'm playing @1900 res.\n\n2) I haven't found any way to customize keybinds. It's an early access but more players would be happily involved if devs focused more on basic gameplay while releasing content step by step. I read a lot of reviews asking for "optimizations" but honestly, optimization comes into play when 80% of all "basic" issues (movement, pause game, customizable keybinds, an essentially accurate search system etc..) are addressed.\n\n3) I appreciate the presence of the mouse Y-axis invert but mouse sensitivity should be rescaled because you need to set it at almost its minimum to have some noticible effects.\n\nThat said,I like the game but I'm not feeling attracted to help this community if these basic needs remain unaddressed. On the contrary i would be available to spend hundreds of hours to support devs with suggestions and user testing if they considered important the topics above and provided a solution (at least for points 1 and 2).","July 29, 2015","false","1.1"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","20","29","2","1"

So as my buddy was complaining about his thirst bar going down, I was going to be nice and give him a coconut I had found earlier, turned out I threw it at him instead of giving it. He died...

Steve gave me a letter and some apples and a water bottle, Steve is nice. Started to rain so I left Steve to find shelter, got really cold and started to get sick, ran into what looked like alligators, didnt get close enough to find out. Found a village with dead people, found another water bottle and some keys.\n\nNight 1 - Got very dark, had not sticks could not make a torch, spent the night in the village and surrounding woods looking for sticks and apples, found none. Decided to walk down the shoreline. I miss Steve.\n\nDay 2 - found another small island with a village, swam over and searched around, found a knife, tried to stab a tree to get wood, didn't work. decided to search the small island and found a radio tower, and 5 keys. Swam back to larger island and found another fishing village, same materials found, cloth, oil and keys...so many keys. Wonder if one of them belongs to Steve.\n\nNight 2 - Ran outta food, still no sticks, so no torch or campfire. went deeper into the island found a cottage, looked nice found 3 lighters inside. Close to starving, found out I can continously shake trees for sticks and food to drop, hooray!\n\nDay 3 - Break of dawn, an apple finally drops from a tree I am overjoyed, losing health fast, inventory is full, dropped lighters, picked up apple, started eating apple....died after taking first bite. Should have stayed with Steve.\n\nGame is very enjoyable. Optimization is a bit on the sour side but still playable for the most part (They are working on it). Graphics are decent to say the least, animations are kinda stiff and could use some work thou. Game can be played in Third or First person and the controls are smooth for both modes. Audio is nice with some good ambient noises, music gets a bit annoying thou but easily fixed by turning it off.\n\nThe Inventory/Crafting system is on the slow side, instead of click and drag you have to use a click menu, also you can not use anything from the inventory you have to equip it to the action bar first, This can easily waste precious time in a life and death situation as I had above.\n\nOverall I am impressed and look forward to see how this game progresses.","July 23, 2015","true","3.8"," 117 of 232 people (50%) found this review helpful 138 people found this review funny","50","117","232","138","7"

Fought it with a pipe that I found earlier on and won! Many minutes later, I will also have survived starvation, thirst, a wolf, and a broken leg. Suddenly a storm passes through and I catch a damn cold and die because I couldn't find shelter quick enough, (it's always the things you don't see coming). So I booted the game up again and started fresh. This time I found myself stranded on a different island! Explored for a few of minutes, found some cottages, looted the hell outta them and found some valuables. Rain storm comes through again, but this time I survive with the help of some pills and the protection of a little hut ;-) For now, I've saved my progress, and can't wait to jump back in tomorrow.

You can tell this game has a back story and im willing to put in the time to see how this game developes. For a very low price this game does outshine a few other low priced survival games.\n\nThe gameplay (for me) is smooth, fps is at 60. All of this can be tweeked to suit your own needs, but the options arent very extensive and there is no key binding for those who like to set their own (like me) but that isnt a problem at all.\n\nIn this early access, the items are few but the dangers are real. Animals as well as falling of a cliff can end it for you so what yourself. I have been testing the ragdoll and such, you limb when your break a bone which is so cool.

But couldn't find out how to cook meat, or make a campfire.. or is there one?

I opens inventory.\n\nAlso, bears. RAwr!\n\nDisadvantages:\nLow FPS results in jerky movement, even at lower screen resolutions. Is unopptimized compared to other survial sandbox games.\n\nThe mouse interaction system is still a nightmare.\n\n\nFIRST REVIEW FROM 28 JULY 2015\nHow I spent my <10 minutes in this early-access game:\n\nOoooo. I love me some survial sandbox games. I install it, and then run it. Cool intro in which the protaganist is...I won't spoil it. When I get to the island, I discover it's third-person over-the-shoulder camera. Evidently I can't switch to first person. I hate 3rd person, but I'll soldier on.\n\nGiven the jerky way this game runs, the graphics are not impressive. I suspect this will get optimized eventually.\n\nHmm. After trying the trusty E key to pick something up, I discover TAKE is not bound to E. Not a problem, I'll rebind. Hmm. ESC key doesn't let me see options to rebind keys, so I can't actually pick anything up. But wait! I can right-click on an item, and then left-click to interact with it. That is a terrible mechanic. And I still can't pick anything up.\n\nAnd when I uninstall it in my STEAM library, this cursed game's name still remains and looks like it is still installed.\n\nFortunately I only paid ca. $5 for it, and it is just released, so perhaps in six months it will be better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shyxxxtina/recommended/352950/","Shyxxxtina","Steph","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shyxxxtina/","379 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBEFORE THE JOURNEYMy mouse pointer got stuck in a designated square area when I swapped to a 1920x1080 fullscreen resolution. As soon as the intro story was over it fixed itself, that, or me hitting alt+enter a few times fixed it, not sure which one.\n\nTHE JOURNEYDay 1: I walked towards the black bodybag and read the note. (The controls are very floaty, even turning down the mouse sensitivity didn't help much). Beside him lay a few apples and a water bottle. Me and these items had a war for 2 minutes as I tried to pick them up. (The area range to pick items up is a bit off). I stood there for another minute or so, adjusting the ambiance sound because the flies were driving me crazy. I walked on, looking for anything I could try to pick up. I shook many trees vigorously, to no avail, no coconuts, no twigs, nothing. I pressed on, coming across a deer that looked yummy, yet I had no weapon to murder it with. But what is that in the distance? A huge cottage? definitely shelter. There had to be something in there I could use. I ran towards it, my little heart gleaming with joy. But then, out of nowhere, a rabid ManBearPig (Dog/wolf) attacked me and kept chasing me! I was defenseless. I tried to run away, getting closer to the shelter, but it was too late, I was dead.\nI lasted 10 minutes 23 Seconds.\n\nDay 2: Fantastic spawn. (Sarcasm). Instantly raining. I quickly read the bodybag note and chased down the apples and water bottle that was rolling away. (It wasn't even on a hill or a slope lol). I started to freeze to death as I ran along a steep cliff that I slowly descended. (Seems logical). At the bottom there was a crate, a crate with a knife. YES! I got this now. But wait, what was that? An alligator? It charged towards me and I bravely fought back with my new knife, or was I even fighting back? The alligator didn't think so. I'm pretty sure it even said "No hitbox for you!" Then it murdered me and laughed while hovering my dead corpse.\nI lasted 2 Minutes 5 Seconds.\n\nAFTER THE JOURNEYIt seems to be a pretty fun game, if you can get past the bugs and the clunky controls. I am not big on survival/crafting games, but this one has a lot of potential and caught my interest. I have yet to try the multiplayer aspect of the game, but I'm sure that will make it 100 times more enjoyable, for me that is. I don't like dying alone lol.\n\nThe game was only released a few days ago and has already undergone multiple updates and fixes. The developers listen to feedback and are quick to implement changes to better improve the game. Even in it's current state, I recommend this game. It can only get better from here on out. Just watch out for those ManBearPigs.","July 25, 2015","true","8.3"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","48","14","29","14","4"

I play on a Mac and the game ran really well in the highest resolution with all the effects turned on. I had a small mouse issue which the developer responded to in double-quick time which demonstrates their commitment to the title in my books.\n\nSo far I've only played in single player mode. The crafting system works well, I still think there's room to refine it a little. The island is very mysterious and I'm still feeling my way around. All in all I think that BLTD is a great addition to my Steam collection, especially at such a knock-down price. I'll be coming back to the game often to see how the developers are improving things. It's fine right now but I think BLTD could become a classic.","July 23, 2015","true","0.6"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","1"

You will get hints in the storyline about helping your self, and how much of your current items you used, the weight etc. The game does not offer any kind of a map, you have to remember the island.\n\nI like the idea of the game, but so far it's too empty and kinda bored me out to run around to find 3 keys that could be anywhere on the island. The game does not offer a propper multiplayer either without you are hosting it your self. This can be done by using "Evovlehq" for those who don't want to play with port-forwarding yarda-yarda. Which means, if you are reading this and think "I want to play with my friend, but no-one can host", then you cannot play together.\n\nOverall the intro and how you are getting into the game is really good. It need some more love and content, but if you want to support their idea and game, go a head. Just be careful. You're slightly limited so far.\n\nGive it some time, and come back. I will keep my eyes open for updates.\nHere is a demo: http://www.twitch.tv/theearlyaccess/v/8312170","July 23, 2015","true","1.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","2"

Important thing to remember is I have not played for extended lengths and there are still many things to learn. I have done a 30 minute video which you can see below and here are my fist thoughts:\n\nCons:\nControls seem clunky and a bit disorganised (think Dead Space but not as smooth)\nOptions are very limited and not much to change\nGraphics- although fairly good- nothing at all like the video on the store page- (I have it maxed)\nHunger drops way to fast and although I found coconuts early- I was unable to find a knife to open them\nNo Tutorial- would be nice to have some sort of beginning area to get used to what we can do\nNo map to speak of so need to explore every small area to make sure nothing important is missed\n(More to come)\n\nPros:\nUpdates are coming in on release day\nDevs seem to be very active on the forums\nGame will be community driven\nRefreshing to see a single player driven game that you can also enjoy with a few friends\nLove the opening cinematic and artwork style\nReally pretty locations of the areas I have seen\nGreat price of only 5.49 Euro!\n(More to come)\n\nSummery:\n\nOverall I would say this game is a good bargain for the price of a fast food meal that will go down better and last longer :)\nIf you love supporting early access games I would recommend this game- It still needs a lot of polish but has the potential to be something great and with no zombies!

As soon as I visited this page I got hyped and bought it. As most reviewers are saying, I wasn't able to play it at all really due to the poor optimization, which I am aware you are fixing. Additionally, I feel that there could be more options to better benefit the player in the settings.

First impressions is it runs fairly well on my rig for an  Alpha. The Island looks gorgeous even if the graphics are still bland at the moment. I have no idea what to do though, thats on me not a con. I'm walking around eating apples and that satifies me enough. The cool thing is the game has a story (correct me if i'm wrong) so it is pretty unique. With the future updates, the game will become even better. It's only like $5 now too so instead of buying those CS GO keys, might as well spend on it on a game with great potential.\n\n10/10 would eat apples again.","July 23, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

It features a perma death feature which may or may not turn away soft-core gamers. In its current state and price point its worth trying. It does have some short comings but it is also in ALPHA. Otherwise the game is solid. Heres Why.\n\nPros:\n1. Solid game play with very few bugs for early access.\n2. Graphics are good for the price point.\n3. Survival gameplay is simple yet challenging. It is fun exploring different crafting methods.\n4. The world has been crafted beautifully. It could only get better.\n5. Weather effects add to ambiance.\n\nCons:\n1. Targeting wild animals can be extremely difficult especially if they are right next to you.\n2. framerate can drop during rain and sleet effects.\n3. trying to figure out how to craft things you NEED can be a chore and kinda ruin the pacing of the game.\n4. Shaking trees feels and looks strange.\n5. There is no pause. You will continue to become thirsty and hungry while crafting or in the menu.\n\nHere are some things that will improve the game in my opinion.\n1. Character creation.\n2. Targeting\n3. start out with knife\n4. perma death is optional (should do this one first)","July 25, 2015","true","5.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

Well, to get started, it seems like it was optimized by a caveman, And this comes from a guy with a really nice  computer. The graphics are hard to look at, trees in the distance give you a headache sometimes, and even with some graphic options pumped up, it still kinda looks ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I usually dont care about the graphics, but these... these are hard to look at. The camera feels wobbly and uncontrollable at times, and first person mode is the same. I do wish you could like, sneak up on predators by crouching, or sneak away by crouching, but the animals in this game have the reflex and magical ability of a God. It feels like you are trying to guide your pee into the toilet with morning wood when swimming. The knife animation looks cool at first, but then you realize how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is when you attack something. NO SERVER LIST.\nLETS LOOK AT THE PROS: So when wielding the knife, you walk differently, and you are in a combat looking mode, and it actually does look nice, even though it is useless. The tree shaking ability seems really cool, even though it kinda ends up just giving you infinite food on the island. You can get sick by a bush, and I still cant grasp how to prevent that from happening, but it seems legit. In order not to freeze and die in rain, you have to get in  a building, which adds some depth to the game. Crafting does exist. There is a really cool pickup mode when picking stuff up, you press the right mouse button to zoom in and it gives you the option to pick stuff up. You can also break bones, lose blood, and not die.\nCONCLUSION: It is a good concept, and I hope you get it to support the game. It is full of bugs, and the game at times seems unplayable, but I still kinda enjoy it.","July 26, 2015","true","1.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stevegad/recommended/352950/","stevegad","GAD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stevegad/","28 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game has lots and I mean LOTS of potential. Its atmospheric, and the graphics are pretty good too. At time of writing I am still figuring stuff out and 25 or so deaths later, I have yet to achieve anything of any real use. I also can't for the life of me get the "Run" key set, despite trying virtually every free key on my keyboard. I like the fact that you know so little about the islands you are on, leaving lots of scope for adventure.\nIt gets dark, but mercifully you can find a bed to sleep in if you're lucky. The Wolf (sometimes the Crocodile) appear a little too early in my journey - in other words, when I have only a few Palm leaves for protection. Also, the targeting system when you want to fight back isn't easy to get to grips with, You really should be able to lash out with a stick, rather than scramble to remember what you assigned as you "Select Target" key.\nThese little gripes aside, the game was very cheap, and the good news is that if this becomes popular and the Devs don't lose interest, it has the potential to be a real grower of a survival game,  along the lines of '7 Days to Die' but with better weather and living enemies.\nI know a lot of work goes into the development of these games and it's obvious that more than a little love has also been stirred into the pot here. Keep up the good work Devs, lose the silly target system thing and introduce more animals, and the ability to grow stuff and I'll be singing your praises to everyone within earshot.\nI like it because I can see what's possible here. Thumbs up.\n\nEDIT: April 22nd.\nWell, in the nearly 4 months I have owned the game, I can still not map the run key to the one I use for almost all my games. Being left handed means a headache when wanting to sprint. I know its a small moan but its an immersion breaker in a game like this. As I said before, this game DOES have a lot of potential with a little love and care. PLEASE, please make the key bindings save. I can use the [ key to sprint in my other games, so why not here? The tendancy for loot to come from trees and roll 25 yards down a slope is a pain when time is of the essence, but monor gripes aside I STILL have a lot of faither in the game.","December 28, 2015","true","7.9"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","2","10","0","0"
