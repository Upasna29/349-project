Fun for all ages and a Buy for Kart Racing enthusiasts.\n\nfull review.Teddy Floppy Ear - The Race is a cute, little Kart Racer that has more going on than you can shake a stick at.  It has several racing modes, several kart performance upgrades, plenty of unlockables from cars to characters, several difficulty levels to accomodate racers of all skill-levels and some beautiful and cartoony courses with enough variety to keep it interesting.  Best of all, it has a surprisingly solid sense of speed, which is core to any good racing game.\n\nIt's unfortunate that this game doesn't get a fair chance inspite of it's lineage; from the perspective of a single-player Kart Racer, it's pretty darn good.\n\nThere are, however, some minor problems:\n\nFirst: the wonky controls.\nThey are soft and slippery.  They can almost feel broken when you first start playing.  But... once you adapt to the steering mechanics and adjust your driving style, you will find yourself speeding around corners and passing your competitors with ease and glee. The learning curve for me was about 45-minutes of race-time.\n\nSecond: The weird music.\nAnd as far as the music goes, it's weird and a total mismatch for what is happening on-screen. Turn it off in the Settings and play your own up-tempo music of choice.  I played EDM and Trance for this game and it kicked up the atmosphere to eleven.\n\nOnce you disable the weirdly mismatched music and spend some time learning how to control your racer... it becomes really fun!\n\nIt's definitely no Sonic Racer, but, it's certainly better and more fun than, the albeit more polished, F1 Race All-stars.  Of all the Kart Racers on Steam, it's a worth-while one.\n\nAt full price (4,99 at the time of this review), I would recommend this for Kart Racing enthusiasts. However, if you enjoy Kart Racing and are the type of gamer who is willing to put a bit of time into learning how to steer your kart, then this is an easy Buy, especially if you get it on sale.\n\npros.+ Cute pseudo-paper-cutout graphics style\n+ Well-designed tracks, including shortcuts\n+ Beautifully cartoony tracks\n+ Fun and responsive power-ups and attacks\n+ Day and night tracks\n+ Good AI competitors\n+ Solid sense of speed\n+ Split-screen, local multiplayer (I didn't test this)\n+ Many unlockables (tracks, cars, characters, etc)\n+ Kart performance upgrades (tires, exhaust, paint jobs, etc)\n+ Full 1080P Support\n+ Full Controller Support\n\ncons.- Music is just terrible  (turn it off and play your own)\n- Kart controls are sloppy, but fun once you adapt\n- No online multiplayer support\n- Limited graphics settings\n\nThis game is appropriate for all ages and skill-levels.","June 24, 2015","true","13.8"," 61 of 66 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","61","66","0","13"

Yes the game is fun but issue is at least for me the controls. You def need to keep your finger on the gas and slowly release it on the turns or you keep your finger on the gas and break on turns smoothly in order to make decent turns. So I believe this game requires more skill then expected. Keep in mind you must make a lot of SHARP turns to avoid other npc hurtful pickups and track obsticles.\n\nSo if you are looking for an easy 100% or a casual game I don't think this is a fit but believe it or not this is a bit more "competative" then what it looks like lol at least for my noobie skills. I still will play it but I do not see myself playing it a lot since it only has local co-op.\n\nSo if you are looking for something like this then this is the game for you but don't be fooled by how kiddie it looks!","August 1, 2015","true","6.7"," 41 of 47 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","41","47","2","3"

It starts off as a goofy non-serious kart racer until you actually start getting into the racing. The racing itself feels more like it is trying to be a simulator. You need to know racing lines, and the slow in fast out techniques that apply in Gran Turismo, Forza, and Project Cars. Combine that with some seriously goofy weapons. That said, i am rather surprised at how fluent the controls are on the gamepad.\n\nI went into this cracking up thinking "what on Earth am i buying for a dollar." to going "wow, this is rather fun!'. Needless to stay i am still dieing whenever i see the name of this. The music on the other hand.. i am indifferent to it, it isn't bad, yet it isn't great. I'd recommend playing your own stuff after a while.\n\nI would not recommend this for young kids who may not be experienced with simulators, this game is deceptive and they will get frusturated quickly. I certainly was not expecting the sim aspect. Think Gran Turismo with the option to cheat with goofy weapons and oil slicks.\n\nI have only played about 15 minutes, but i must say i am pleasantly surprised by the gameplay itself. Kudos to the devs on a job well done.","July 30, 2015","true","1.7"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","27","32","3","0"

It's nothing like that.\n\nMultiplayer is somewhat supported, meaning it will supposedly offer two-player split screen racing.  However, when we tried it, none of the controls would work.  Plus, apparently only one controller is supported, so the second player would need to use the keyboard.  At least, I think so, because we could not actually get it working.\n\nWe did get it to work on single player.  However, the sound effects are offensively bad, the controls are terrible, and the car would often just flip over for no reason.   Not fun, not entertaining, and certainly not worth the several dollars we paid for the game.\n\nThere was only one review when I bought the game, and it was positive.   Now there's a realistic review, so you've been warned.","May 23, 2015","false","0.7"," 62 of 96 people (65%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","65","62","96","6","1"

Likable characters, easy interface, nice variety of race types, etc.\n\nThe game suffers from a major flaw. It is WAY too hard for its intended audience which is children. The NPC characters are too unforgiving of mistakes and children will be frustrated. At higher difficulties and tracks, some of the races are very difficult. I am a seasoned Mario Kart player and even I have difficulty winning some races or time trials. I’m guessing it would be near impossible for younger kids, especially if they have not been brought up on keyboard only controls (see below).\n\n99% of the races are determined by fractions of second (which makes it even odder why the developers chose to use whole second rather than hundredths), often with racers crossing the finish line at the same time.\n\nI found the controls simple unlike many other reviewers. You basically only use A W D and the space bar with an occasional S key thrown in when you screw up and have to back up…not sure what all the fuss is. I think many Steam users are console immigrants or are not old school keyboarders (read: spoiled). The controls are fine the way they are.\n\nWhile the game has cute elements and is very enjoyable, overall I cannot recommend the game as it will not appeal to its target audience.\n","March 28","false","17.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

There are also a bunch of power-ups that speed you up or the others down (no weapons more violent than a box of thumbtacks, though). There's no story. All in all it's fairly varied.\n\nYou get two keyboard setups and you can also use one Xbox controller, which unfortunately is also all you get for split-screen. I'm calling this a beginners game because the AI and the difficulty of the challenges are no match for more experienced players once you've gotten the hang of the game (do have a look at the help before you start).  Physics are a bit strange in that you get rubber on the road long before you can hear a tire squeal, and I turned the music off after a while, but all in all it handles predictably enough for cart game physics.\n\nI'm approximately halfway through the game, and to me it feels casual and I'm happy I didn't spend any money on it. But given the variety of race modes and tracks, it'd be a good game for a budding racing gamer - and that's precisely who it's aimed at.

Not only is this game great to look at, its easy to run. A great starter game. It has local co-op so you can play it with your pals, the split-screen makes it great for parties and social gatherings. you can hook it up to the tv for hours of fun. The driving is realistic and cartoony enough to give you a unique racing experience. All together this game can go toe to toe with fallout 4, rainbow 6, or any other triple a title. In conclusion, this game cured my aids, which ment I didn't have to pay so much for my medical bills. so i quit my night job because i only worked there for the medical bills in the first place, giving me more time to play Teddy Floppy Ear - The Race.\nI can't recommend this highly enough.\nA Masterpiece in gaming","January 12","true","19.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

A surprising amount of modes and unlockable vehicles and tracks, given the low price, although it seems like all the vehicles handle exactly the same. The only real downside is the music, which I found obnoxious, but kids might like it. Older children might get bored with it quickly, but young kids and adults looking for an adorable time waster can't go wrong at the price, especially if you can get the bundle on sale (currently $1.09 for all three Teddy Floppy Ear games). If you're expecting something with the depth and variety of Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, you're going to be disappointed, but again, consider the price.

I also LOVE the graphics in this game.\n\nOn the bad side, for a Steam game, Teddy Floppy Ear over-dos it on the "happy, yay, fun time" factor. It also **HAS A GLITCH WHERE WHEN YOU SHIFT INTO REVERSE MODE, IT WON'T LET YOU STOP.** That might just be for mac users, (I use a mac) but it might be the reason why this game isn't so popular.\n\nIf you are a perspective parent, I would recommend this game for all ages 7+.\nIf you are a perspective gamer, I would recommend this game for people who want a casual game to play for a few months, and people who just want to have fun.\n\nIm not making a conclusion paragraph, because i'm too lazy, and it's 10:30 at night!!!

I would recommend this game to everyone, all of my friends must play this, it was in the autumn sale so after i finish writing this review i shall go off and purchase this and all of the other games for each and everyone, and so should you. If you are into F1 games or Mario Kart or any similar titles you should definitely purchase this game for it shall blow your mind with the glory of its gameplay, graphics and multiple and very intricate settings options. i absolutely adore this game and so will you if you spare £7.99 for this bundle of amazingness and dedicate merely 30 minutes of your time. I will be shortly nominating this game for The Game Of The Year Award 2015, i strongly advise you all to do the same so we can immerse ourselves yet again in another heart melting adventure with the comforting, lovable, ball of fuzz which is Teddy Floppy Ear himself.\n\nThis game comes with multiple features such as, and not limited to local multiplayer, full controller support (even for non brand controllers), steam cloud storage, this will allow for no space to be taken on your computer other than the initial installation. I have heard in previous comments and posts that the driving is slippery and difficult to control, this is merely due to the fact the game is presumed to be aimed towards an older audience (8-10) in my opinion this allows for the older children to feel more engaged as they have more of a challenge to face in the game. unlike the other Teddy Floppy Ear titles this game adds a far more challenging side to the series, this really stood out to me as a PC gamer as it allows for more character to flow through the series of games ranging from an easy laidback vibe in the first two games to a more front heavy vibe to the third.\n\nMonday 15th February 2016 10:10pm  -\nHowever, in my time playing along with my good friend Po, we came across a slight and minor discrepancy which was the fact even though Po's time was 1.35 and the bot Hare's time was 1.29, Po placed in front of Hare. This aroused a slight confusion between Po and myself. Despite this small problem, it was an extremely enjoyable experience and Po and I shall be returning to the game very promptly.","November 28, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","3"

However this game is ridiculously easy for me as a veteran in the racing genre and there is no challenge at all not even at the highest difficulty. I didn't even had to restart, I just played through the tracks.

The joke is there is no joke. Teddy Floppy Ear's - The Race has a good unique look that makes it stand out from a pack of other kart racing games. The real deterrent is that its a lot tougher to play, if you take a turn too hard, you will spin out and turning feels loose in general. Perhaps that makes it a better game to play with a keyboard or a steering wheel peripheral. Because of the difficulty it misses that child demographic and falls into the men who like colorful ponies demographic.\n\nYou race in single player or two players with local split screen. Before you begin, you have your choice of fourteen anthropomorphic characters and two little girls. Its a bizarre choice to have two humans girls thrown in the mix with animals. There's no sort of indication that playing as the goat is better than the dog.\n\nNext there is a choice of ten real world, European inspired vehicles including the Fiat, Maluch and the Trabant, with no indication of stats. You earn part upgrades by going through race seasons. You have them no matter what car you select. The only problem like the rest of the game is that without stats, its tough to feel any difference with or without them. Plus, once they're unlocked, you have them forever.\n\nThe tracks are all closed circuit courses with three laps each that last around 90 seconds for each lap. They each feel like a healthy length at under five minutes each, but any longer than that would be too much. Like other kart racers, the tracks are wide to make room for the chaos that ensues. These tracks all stay on the ground. There are no sweet jumps. At the most you'll go through a tunnel, under a bridge and then over it.\n\nThere are a few hazards to look out for, mud that will slow you down and water that's so brilliant its a true hazard. Normal kart racers would spin you out then and there, but with Teddy Floppy Ear's - The Race, the water affects when you next turn where even the slightest turn becomes harsh. If you ever drive through water, the longer you can drive forward, the safer you are. You always have brakes, but who uses those in a racing game?\n\nThe game lacks nitro and turbo, so the game is reliant on weapons. These weapons are all generic, bland and wholesome, but its what you want for a kids game. You run through hovering weapon icons each with their own color. White milk, yellow lemonade, maroon mud, cyan tacks, purple kibble, red fire extinguisher and blue boots. Milk makes you grow larger so you can flatten enemies if you're going fast enough. The only problem is that you're so large it becomes easy to tumble over and roll sideways. The fire extinguisher and kibble both seem to do the same thing which is a radial explosion that either pushes or tumbles over adversaries. The tacks spray a hard-to-see bed of tacks. Mud makes a mud puddle to slow down drivers, the lemonade does just about the same thing and the boots let you drive through any hazard. The mud, demimondaine and boots each give you a short nitro boost. Someone thought it would be a good idea for animals to leave pools of yellow and brown liquid on the track.\n\nOne of the best risk or reward mechanics in the game is having single weapons alone next to kiosks. Ninety-nine percent of the time you can grab the weapon just fine, but its that one percent that has you colliding into the stand. There is a respawn button, but it drops you from a bit high so its a few second penalty for using it.\n\nThe bulk of the game is short, two hours spread across four seasons with five tracks that each have a day and night to make them feel different. Three of the closed circuit tracks blend together while the castle and town feel beautiful and a fresh take with the art style. Night races are dark and only challenging because its tougher to see. There are lights and lanterns, but going over bridges and some other areas, they've been forgotten about.\n\nThere is no difficulty setting for the seasons. Instead the earlier seasons start with three tracks and the latter ones have more. It never felt like the later championships were any more difficult than the earlier ones. There are four difficulty levels for single races.\n\nTo keep you in the game there is a collector's slalom which has you collecting stars along a path. Collecting over eighty percent grants you a voucher for a free vehicle. Collect all five and you unlock the new vehicle. This feels like a great mode to increase the game's longevity without having too much development time. It sure beats having only a time trial.\n\nThen you have the floppy cups which are tournament races where you go one-on-one against drivers. It just feels dull in a kart combat game to only have one racer. It also looks awkward when I'm the winner standing alone on top of a podium meant for three.\n\nThe unsung hero is the music. Its noticeable how soothing it is with a good light beat and melody. Its rare to find flutes in video game music let alone a racer.\n\nIts a definite toss up whether to recommend the game. Its worth the cheap five dollar price tag for the two hours and whatever else you can garner from the game. It feels like the driving should have been more typical when it comes to a kid's game. Plus there should really be a kid's auto drive mode that mobile phone games seem to have. Its a game worth having a sequel for its style.","January 22","false","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
