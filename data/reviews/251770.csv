It didnt age well but it still gives off a really eerie atmosphere, mostly thanks to the sounds and music.\n\nThe controls feel a bit stiff but nothing thats impossible to handle. Some of the weapons you'll obtain are rather unnecessary since most enemies will be easily dealt with with your starting weapon. Only A few sections will need other weapons or upgrades to actually progress.\n\nI recommend checking the bonus content folder in your installation directory since it contains a strategy guide with overall gameplay tips as well as some rough maps of the areas.\n\nWhile overall saving seems to be not really necessary, unless you want to quit, it is mandatory if you are going for the final boss.\n\nIt might just have been my luck but going for the final boss I did not save beforehand. After failing the fight on my first try I was brought back to the title menu without a second chance, losing 3 hours of progress.","November 13, 2013","true","22.6"," 55 of 58 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","55","58","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiderjerusalemforpresident/recommended/251770/","spiderjerusalemforpresident","McRyan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiderjerusalemforpresident/","187 products in account","Shadow Man is a game which I revisit every year in the autumn, the perfect horror themed game, no jump scares but a lot of disturbing visuals and sound with a twist of dark humour. The graphics have not aged well but it doesn't affect the gameplay value conisdering this is from 1999.\n\nThe game is based on the comic of the same name (More specifically Volume II: the Garth Ennis era) and it does capture the feel of the comic very well. The story is about a Shadow Man called Michael LeRoi who is told of a premonition of impending apocolypse and you have to stop that from happening using whatever Voodoo powers you can get. Along the way you get help from Nettie, a Voodoo priestess and Jaunty, a dead Irish man with the head of a human skull and a body of a snake with a sense of humour.\n\nI have played and own all versions of the game (N54, PS1, Dreamcast and PC) and I can safely say that this, along with the Dreamcast version is the full, definitive game with no cutbacks like the N64 and PS1 versions. The game is pretty difficult if you are playing this for the first time. You would often get lost and backtrack certain areas but that is a good thing since the worlds (Liveside and Deadside) are very immersive, this is best played in the dark and in the night for the ultimate experience.","October 19, 2014","true","4.7"," 46 of 48 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","46","48","0","0"

It has been 15 years since Michael, the Shadow Man, took up arms to fight the so-called Five (a group of serial killers) in order to stop Armageddon from happening. Back then it was a rather interesting concept - travelling from the living world to the dead and vica versa, if need be. Emphasis was on the latter (Deadside) as Mike's powers did not work during the day.\n\nThis is a horror game - Deadside has blood instead of water when it comes to the rivers and you fight zombies and all kinds of demons. You walk on the corridors of an asylum that certainly gives everybody the creeps.\n\nIt is my understanding that the game is based on a comic book with the same title. I do not know how well this was adapted but I certainly remember this game as a classic. It was creepy and it was haunting me for days.\n\nIt was also difficult not like today's casual games. Beside the fight there were puzzle solving tasks, as well. I downloaded and installed it not long ago and was positively surprised to see it running quite well via Steam.\n\nThe game, unfortunately, did not age well (in fact, it looks quite ugly compared to today's games) but if you can see it as a 15 year old software and you have all the time in the world and nothing else to play you can easily purchase this classic.\n\nI heard there was a sequel which was never released on PC but that is another story.","August 13, 2014","true","0.1"," 52 of 58 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","52","58","2","1"

If you like Ocarina of Time (or any 3D Zelda for that matter), and you think it could have used some blood, then you'll dig this - no doubt about it. Graphics are a little crusty, but the visual design is still striking today. The enemies could not be creepier, and the low-poly models and odd motion-captured movements only make them more unsettling. It also plays fine with Keyboard+Mouse after a little key binding. The music and sound design is as good as ever, and if you go for all the collectibles, the game could last you an easy 50-odd hours. This took me weeks to finish when I was a youngster.\n\nIt's a damn shame that this game seems to have been forgotten over time. It was pretty groundbreaking back in the day, and none of it's impact has diminished.\n\nBrilliant game, and worth whatever you may pay for it.","October 30, 2014","true","1.7"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","40","42","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PtJones/recommended/251770/","PtJones","Pt.Jones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PtJones/","298 products in account","Still a Classic!\n\nShadow man was one of the many great games I owned on my n64, and one of my many games I just never managed to finish it (damn you mission impossible!), this was mostly due to it being in French (I lived in Swiss) and so I couldn’t understand what to do, but also of its complex levels structures. Nonetheless I still did enjoyed the game and found it had quite a unique atmosphere. 11 Years later I finally decide to have a go on it again, and what a surprise I must say!\n\nThe Story\n\nIn Shadow man you play as Michael LeRoi who possess voodoo powers and can travel both worlds of the living and dead. Summoned by Mama Nettie, he must travel to Deadside a place where all living things go after death. Here he must stop a great evil being “Legion” along with five serial killers who are trying to gather dark souls to bring pain and suffering to those of the living world. Michael must travel to vast lands and fight his way through them in order to gather these darks souls before evil does.\n\nThe Game\n\nApart from the straightforward story the game is offering, it still offers plenty of insight and character background for each main good or evil characters. The story is unique and quite pleasant if one decides to follow it; the game is dark, gory, and has a gothic (kickass!) soundtrack which helps to further get involve with the game. The voice cast is brilliant, especially Michael, and I must say that for its time the graphics weren’t that bad as some people claim to be. Indeed the graphic was something that didn’t really bother me; I value more gameplay, over graphics.\n\nIf offers a large number of different distinctive environments which become available once the player has gathered the necessary number of dark souls and item. This game offers quite similar mechanics seen in other video games such as in “The Legend of Zelda”. Another similar factor to Zelda would be that you are free to explore any level (as long you have the necessary number of souls), so even though it is quite linear, it still offers some freedom. However due to the large levels, the first time navigating through them can be quite a hassle because they tend to become like a maze, and so this is where perhaps having a mini map could have come in handy.\n\nThrough each level the player must solve puzzles, defeat enemies, swim, jump, climb, collect cadeaux, items, souls, were only some may be only obtainted if you possess the right ability or item. The player can fast travel using a teddy bear, and save his progress whenever he/she wishes. All the items and weapons you gather are store inside an inventory and Michael can equip two items at the same time, this makes life much easier rather than continuously scrolling to the desired item.\n\nThe Good\n\n•	Amazing Soundtrack\n•	Great story\n•	Great voice acting\n•	Long and enjoyable game\n•	Good graphics (at those times)\n\nThe Bad\n\n•	First time navigating a level can become quite a hassle\n•	Can take some time getting used to the camera and controls\n•	Some back tracking is needed to further progress through the game\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nIn overall I really do enjoy the game and recommend it to anyone who enjoys action adventures games like Tomb Raider and The Legend of Zelda. It has a deep story with an enjoyable soundtrack, and for the price I can guarantee you that its more than what it is worth for. Additionally steam are kind enough to give you the entire soundtrack, a avatar, and some PDF’s of the games map, quick reference card, and a neat strategy guide that will definitely come in handy!\n\n8/10","November 25, 2013","true","27.0"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","40","42","0","2"

Unfortunatly, I was never able to beat it because my N64 memory card corrupted. I see the PC version has a lot more in it. More enemies, more secrets, and maybe it's just spots I missed or don't remember, but it seems like there's more areas too. While exploring deadside, I found a few spots that just didn't look familiar at all. The quality is a lot better too. The default controls are a little crappy, but they can be changed. This game has many many hours of gameplay to it, especailly if you want to find all of the dark souls and secrets.\n\nThe gameplay itself is kind of like a cross between Tomb Raider and The Legend of Zelda.

One of my favourite games on Dreamcast didn't disappoint with it's mature theme, dark and heavy atmosphere and disturbing soundtrack.\nIt's few downsides (slightly samey at times, slightly clumsy controls, and it's a bit grindy in places) were far outweighed by the upsides. I never really cared for stories in games but this one had a great one. It's quite original, involving the hunt for 5 serial killers with an interesting take on who Jack the Ripper really was. It's quite a brutal tale at times.\nIt's a big game, with lots of exploring to be had although it's actually more linear than it seems. Not a bad thing. The game also gets better the farther you get, the opposite to most games these days...\nThe soundtrack is also worth a mention on it's own. It's incredibly fitting to the mature theme of the game. It's really weird and disturbing. Youtube 'the playrooms' for an example.\n\nThis PC version was a port of the Dreamcast version (or was it the other way around?) and is far far superior to the PS1 and N64 versions in everyway. If you've only played the game on the latter 2 machines or never played it at all i really do recommend it. It's a great experience. It's a great price also :)\n\nPS.

Speaking of dark, don't hesitate to put some gamma into the game and up the brightness around 10-20% as with how little light there is at times it can make navigating the larger maps more time-consuming than it has to be. I finished the game in 16 hours, give or take an hour or two idling, which I thought was a little too long, given how simple and trivial the combat becomes.\n\nPositives:\n-Interesting world\n-Presents its horror solely by being creepy- no annoying jump scares\n-French naming conventions\n-Fun characters\n-Progression (item acquisition) is somewhat variable and up to the player.\n\nNegatives:\n- The ambience is great, but there's some instances of questionable lack of lighting and informing the player of all entrances/exits to any given area, making me juggle the game with a fan-made walkthrough to double check for overlooked paths.\n-Hearing screams of agony in some of areas' audio tracks can get grating after awhile, the loop's a little too short.\n- Controls need to be toyed with at the start to get a comfortable K+M setting, and even then the mouse can be a little sensitive/ receiving conflicting commands leading to some involuntary movements, but when you need precision, you can always leave the turning to your left and right arrows, while keeping a contemporary WASD movement for general application.\n-Combat becomes trivial halfway through the game.\n-With no map system in-game, it can become a pain racking your brain to remember when and where to backtrack. I used a walkthrough containing maps of each level as a reminder of what I saw.","June 23, 2015","true","27.9"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","1"

I still love this game because of the unique atmosphere and story.  I will go down the list and give my opinion on the games features.\n\nStory: You are the Shadow Man and you must hunt five serial killers in both the world of the living and the world of the dead and collect dark souls in order to stop the end of all things. While the basic story is not the most original, the specific details and voodoo theme really make it unique. 7/10\n\nLore: I gave the story a lower score simply because I wanted to address the lore on its own merit but, if combined with the story, the score would have been a 9/10. As far as the lore goes, the game is loosely based on an earlier comic book and centers around a different hero and for that reason; I won't go into the comics. This Shadow Man, Michael LeRoi, was an English major that dropped out of school, became a cab driver, and one day some gangster/Mafioso types left a bunch of cash in his cab. He quickly paid for his sick brothers operation and bought his family gifts. The gangsters of course murdered his family and Mike ended up spiraling downhill, becoming an assassin for a local voodoo priest/crime lord in exchange for protection. Long story short mama Nettie, a voodoo priestess, implants the mask of shadows in mikes chest, the voodoo crime boss is killed and Nettie gives Mike control of his bar. At night he becomes the Shadow Man and fights the dark forces. This long back story, the bios of the serial killers, the origins of the prophecy, the voodoo references, and the characters stories give this game a very interesting lore behind it which adds heavily to the gameplay. 9/10\n\nGraphics: This game came out in 1998 and even for the time it was not the best looking game but it certainly was not the worst. I can’t rate this game graphically in any fair way since it is going to be 20 years old in a few years. For its time 7/10 today’s standards (which should not affect the score) 2/10\n\nSound: The vast majority of the atmosphere comes from the sound track of the game. While there are not a large variety of level themes, there is enough to make the levels have their own feel and they all fit the environments and add to the immersion without being overly repetitive. The only particular cases are two areas in the asylum where the background screams, laughing/crying, and sounds of torture play so frequently that it becomes obvious the music is looping. This is not a big deal though and these are some of the most frightening levels because of this. The sound effects are very fitting for the game. Fire sounds good, screams sound tortured and in pain, the sound of hooks digging into flesh can make a less then strong stomached person cringe. The voice acting is not perfect but it was, for its time anyway, very good. The characters all have unique and interesting dialogue and the actors express emotions like anger, fear, and confusion believably.\nOverall Sound: 9/10\nMusic: 8.5/10\nSound FX: 9/10\nVoice Acting: 9/10\n\nGameplay: This is the make or break category for any true gamer. The Gameplay here is not unique by any means. It is a platformer like Tomb Raider, and a pretty good one. There are items to collects that serve specific purposes, weapons to find etc. The main gameplay centers on finding 128 dark souls, each making you more powerful. These souls literally work the same way as the stars on Mario 64. The first coffin gate requires no souls to unlock the second requires 1, then 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 to open the level 10 gate. Not all souls are required to finish the game and some are very hard to find. The enemies are interesting and range from basic Zombie Mothers to psychos in gas masks wielding hooks to weird BDSM man/dog creatures clad in bondage outfits. There are 5 unique serial killers to hunt down and kill for their souls. Each one has unique character models, voices, and their own level. The final boss, while not particularly difficult is a great villain and fun to fight. Overall 9/10\n\nOverall Game Score: 8/10\n\nBugs: While there are not too many noticeable bugs, there is a particular problem with the collision detection that occasionally cause the character to stick to doorways upon entering/exiting. This problem is in no way a game breaker however and I think would be of minimal concern for most players. Occasionally while fighting, the music may skip if you are attacked and die under the right conditions. This is rare however and most players likely won't encounter this.\n\nWhether you are a fan of survival horror, platformers, or dark brooding adventures, shadow Man has something to offer everyone. With Fast paced gameplay, interesting story and level design, this game is truly and underrated gem of the late 90's.\n","November 10, 2014","true","1.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

I played the everloving crap out of it back in the day. You may have never heard of it, but believe it or not, this game was higly anticipated at the time. Then it just seemed to fade away. It got an unsuccesful sequel on the PS2 and then it just died. Shadow Man fell into the unforgiving depths of obscurity and gathered a cult following. It was forgotten, abandoned. And then it suddenly appeared on Steam. I don't know what this could mean, but I'm silently hoping for the comeback that this franchise deserves.\n\nIn case you don't know, Shadow Man is an action adventure game that takes elements from Tomb Raider, Zelda, Metroid and Banjo-Kazooie among some others and sprinkles it with a healthy dose of occult horror. Think of it as a 3D metroidvania with collectathon elements. You play as Michael Leroi aka Shadow Man, an immortal voodoo warrior who walks between our world and Deadside. Suffice to say, the apocalypse is nearing and you're the only one who can stop it. You travel across Deadside in search of Dark Souls, dangerously powerful souls that, should they fall into the wrong hands could bring about the end of the world. There's 120 of them scattered across multiple areas, and collecting them is a real treat. The more you get, the more powerful you become, so it's addicting and satisfying. You'll wanna find them all. Along the way there's plenty of platforming and shooting a la Tomb Raider, unearthing special abilities and items that help you progress like in Metroid, top it off with a lot of freedom of exploration, it's like a delicious mix of the best aspects of several different games and I simply adore it.\n\nDownside? Controls are a bit clunky. Precision platforming can be a bit of a hassle when you control like a tank. No free camera movement either. They're not bad, it just takes a while getting used to.\n\nSadly, I wish they would have done a better job with the port. No steam overlay, and I often see my taskbar and the game's window flickering in and out. I feel like the game is just barely there, that it could automatically minimise at any moment. No true controller support either. You can use an Xbox 360 controller, but it won't recognise the shoulder triggers. It's useable, but you'll have play around with the configuration for a bit. As far as I know, it's quite playable with keyboard and mouse, so there's that. Personally I haven't had the game crash yet, but I've seen other people complain about it.\n\nShadow Man on Steam isn't as stable as it should be and it doesn't look like it'll be fixed anytime soon. Still, it works for me and it might work for you too. And it's only 5 bucks. Kind of a steal for a game like this. If you're like me and you wanna get your Shadow Man fix but you're too lazy to plug in your N64 (Dreamcast, PS1), well, here ya go! :p","June 30, 2015","true","27.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

The gameplay consists of platforming, combat and exploration.\n\nIt's a very unique game and in my opinion, very underrated.\n\nYou are the Shadow Man who is a voodoo warrior walker between Liveside, which is our own world and Deadside, which is the resting place for those who have died. An evil demon assembles a team of serial killers called The Five and begins the construction of an army to take over Liveside and you're on a quest to stop him.\n\nIt follows the same sort of structure as games which were out at the time like Tomb Raider or Legend Of Zelda. You must adventure through Temples to gain items that help you progress throughout the game. There is a lot of collectible items that can give you advantages as you play through the story.\n\nThis game is very dark and almost has a gothic edge to its world. It's great value for your money (which is already pretty cheap, even cheaper when sales come around) with the game being packed with content and also offering hours of gameplay.\n\nThere is some small issues with the game in terms of the controls being very awkward (I'd recommend a gamepad as it would probably be easier) and even though I haven't had the issue of compatibility with my PC, others have.\n\nIf you can look past the dated graphics (give it a break, it's from 1999) and the slighty awkward controls, you're in for a treat. Plus, as mentioned before, it's extremely cheap in the sales and also, you get the cracking soundtrack for free. I'd strongly recommend this game.","January 21","true","14.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

And the age shows. It's not the most beautiful game by today's standards and it suffers an issue most early 3D games suffered: wonky camera controls. The controller support isn't amazing (I couldn't map the triggers of my Xbox 360 controller) but they suffice.\nIt's also lacking other advances games have made. Games have become more accessible. Nowadays, you always know where to go. It's clearly indicated or there are even markers on the map.\nIn this game, you will most of the time have no clue where to go. Which for me, was a great thing. You've got a huge world to explore and to figure out where everything is. I do recommend googling "Shadowman Map" when you get this though, since the original physical release came with that map which makes things a little easier. Yeah that's right, there's no ingame map. But it didn't matter to me, it made the game feel like more of an adventure to me.\n\nThe basic gameplay is kind of a 3D Castlevania. You run and jump through the different areas and collect Dark Souls to advance your Shadow Level, which will allow you to go through gates marked with a certain level. On your way you find items to unlock areas which weren't previously accessible. So to fans of that genre, I can definitely recommend this game to you.\n\nOne point I didn't love about this game is the combat. Bascially, you lock onto enemies and then shoot them while evading their attacks until they are dead. This will mean a lot of running backwards and shooting with enemies that come towards you. At the beginning it seems like you're almost comically underpowered, mostly because it seems like enemies are only vulnerable to your attacks during certain animations. When get to higher Shadow Levels, you can charge your gun and the fighting becomes much easier.\n\nWhile the voice acting is pretty good, the story is a little clichéd. The atmosphere makes up for it completely though. The soundtrack is amazingly creepy and while the visuals are dated, there seems to have been a lot of effort put into them. The enemies are very low poly, but still managed to scare me whenever I went around a corner and one of them surprised me. There's many levels with different themes and it's a lot of fun exploring all of them, discovering items you might need for your quest.\n\nI can definitely recommend this to anyone who loves Exploration, Horror Games, Metroid, Zelda and so on. Especially since it's very cheap now and you'll get about 20 hours of fun out of it.","June 9, 2015","true","19.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

The gameplay may be a bit sluggish and the graphics may be a bit dated, but it doesn't prevent it from being one hell of a ride through a Voodoo underworld, a huge and schizophrenic citadel of pain built in it by none other than Jak the Ripper himself, mysterious ancient temples (also built in the underworld for some reason), as well as a few creepy "real world" locations where you'll hunt down five immortal murderers including the aforementioned Jack, who's been reincarnated and lurks the London subway. And the whole time you are trying to stop the big bad demon Legion (who looks like a british gentleman, of course) who has plans to bring hordes of undead abominations to Earth from the underworld and conquer it all. I mean, how cool is that?\n\nGameplay-wise, the game plays like some sort of Nintendo 64-type collect-a-thon, like Banjo-Kazooie or even Mario 64, although with not as much reliance on platforming and acrobatics, even though there's a fair share of that still. It has a far heavier focus on combat, simple as it may be, and extremely, I repeat, EXTREMELY satisfying exploration, when in every new locale there always seem to be almost more ways to go than you can keep track of, but never too many so that you'll forget anything or get lost if you're paying the least bit of attention. And like in some similiar games you get new items and abilities that grant you passage to new areas, lots and lots of new areas. Such abilities include swimming in lava and climbing up bloodfalls, by the way.\n\nThe atmosphere is absolutely superb all around, from the desolate wastelands of Deadside, to the depths of the madhouse that is the Asylum, a place built by maniacs for maniacs (and one demon). The music is astounding, ranging from creepy to somber.\n\nAnd if you needed any more convincing, the Power Star equivalent in this game are Dark Souls. I mean, come on. It doesn't get any better than this!","January 10, 2014","true","23.2"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

A necessity for old fans, a consideration for new faces. Reason for negative review is to warn you of the (possibly) game breaking flaws contained. (May contain spoilers on game items/certain puzzles)\n\nThis game was actually one of my childhood favourites. I still remember the demo disk, which had you playing through the Asylum-map.  Entertained me enough to buy the whole game, once I spotted it in a gamestore by accident. The game has you running and gunning in the liveside (our world) and the deadside (A sort of purgatory). As you go, you collect dark souls and all sorts of useful items, both which help you continue your journey through the mazes of the deadside. You need a certain amount of dark souls to attain a certain "level" of sorts, which allows you to go through certain doors in the deadside. Same goes for the items: you need certain items to, for example, climb the rivers of blood or teleport to you another (useful) location. The game could be explained as 3D metroidvania-game. The souls and items are found non-linearly, so the game might have you running for an item which you've already gone past, but only now have the means to attain. This gives you more reason to explore previously visited levels, and at the worst could make you run around for a few hours, looking for that last soul or item you need to advance in the game.\n\nAll in all, I love it. The game gives you a constant feel of exploration, the items and lore are exciting and nothing I've seen in other games. The levels go from a setting of dark to disgusting; Babies crying and meat grinders working their way through the flesh of some poor soul. Despite the dark setting, it has good dark humour thrown in, to not make you take it so seriously.\n\nNow, the negative stuff. The negative part is mostly tied to the engine; lack of features or bugs I don't remember encountering in the original. Some of them are annoying, some of them might outright stop you from advancing in the game. I played through the game from end to finish, gathering the max amount of dark souls and Cadeaux (sort of bonus item) to gain full level and maximum health bars. Here's a list I kept adding to, during my playthrough:\n\n- Gamepad support is awful: The game plays best on gamepad, and the joystick/gamepad support is awful. It will not recognize half of the buttons on your gamepad, and there's a lot of buttons to configure to get the best out of the game. For me, this was saved by the fact that I noticed Pinnacle Game Profiler on sale the day I started playing this game, and the features of that program saved the experience completely. But this is not something you should have to do to get good gamepad-experience. Taking the extra gamepad buttons into consideration shouldn't be too difficult of a task, even when rewiving an old codebase.\n\n- Crashing to desktop: The game crashes to desktop every now and then. Might be that you'll crash couple of times in an hour, might be that you get to play all day without the game crashing. This will make you learn to save your game often, since even losing the last 15 minutes of gameplay always feels excruciating.\n\n- Enemies sometimes shoot through walls: I got killed a couple of times by an enemy I couldn't even see, but they were quite able to suck through my lifebar through a wall.\n\n- You'll fall through floors (rare): Sometimes you'll just encounter a floor, that isn't actually there, making you fall into the abyss and having to reset your level progress.\n\n- The climbing system is sometimes (more often not) broken: You can hang on to ledges in the game, allowing you much greater mobility than a standard jumping-game would afford. When trying to jump from the ledge to the actual platform, the game will force an animation on the character, which might force you through the wall of the ledge, and make you fall into the abyss (Again, losing some of the level progress). As a more major bug: in a certain part of the game you find the ability to hang on ledges that are hot/on fire. When you gain this ability, you are supposed to return to a certain level and make your way around a big flaming "barrel" by hanging on to the ledges and shimmying yourself around the object. But in this part the game is ALWAYS broken: after shimmying a couple of seconds, you will drop off the ledge. ALWAYS. As a new player this WILL make you feel like you are not in the correct place, and should look for a way forward elsewhere, causing many hours wasted. I had to carefully make my way to the very edge of the barrel, partly inside the object, and only then could I grab on the ledge, so that the game would allow for me to shimmy just long enough, that on dropping from the ledge, I would drop to the otherside and continue my journey. Awful shortcoming, and the reason I tipped this review into the negative side.\n\n- Other minor annoyances, possibly existing in the original version: There are these certain underwater propellers you need to avoid in the game, by swimming through the blades. Sometimes when trying to swim through the blades, the game will simply think that you are not actually between the blades, and hurt your character. It's as if the graphics weren't totally in sync with the engine. In other part of the game I had to open a certain door with a key, but the door simply wouldn't budge. Luckily I found a way to the other side of the door and once using the key from there, the door opened. I'm not certain if this was in the original.\n\nAlmost all of these problems are rare occurrences, and might not detract from your experience, but I felt that there were enough problems to give a negative review, as a sort of warning to new players. As an old fan, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and haven't even the slightest buyers remorse. Should you feel like you want part of the experience, and don't mind the mentioned flaws in the game, I very much recommend you to buy and play through this game.","June 27, 2014","false","25.2"," 33 of 57 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","33","57","0","1"

The difference between the two is that this one focuses on ranged combat to the point where even when Shadow Man finds a weapon that kinda looks like a sword, he ends up shooting fireballs out of it. So, instead of hacking and slashing enemies with the Soul Reaver, you will be shooting them with your "Soul Revolver".\n\nYour goal in the game is to go through different areas, while collecting dark souls which are needed to open certain gates, so you can progress further and eventually kill some serial killers (like Jack the Ripper) and the main bad guy, who calls himself Legion ("for we are many") and prevent the apocalypse from happening. Some of those dark souls will be unreachable at first, but throughout the game you will be gaining different abilities like walking/swimming in lava, climbing waterfalls of blood, grabbing to fiery edges, etc., so later you will be able to backtrack and get them. Taking notes while encountering areas you can't reach might not be a bad idea, becuse I can guarantee that there will be moments when you will be confused and have no clue where to go next.\n\nThe game has a fantastic atmosphere. While the blurry textures might be a bit of an eye sore nowadays, the music and various unsettling environmental sound effect are great. You will be hearing a lot of moaning, screaming, squeaky noises and even something that sounds like a dentist's drill (the horror). Blood and gore elements are present in the game also, if you're a fan of those type of things.\n\nI haven't encountered any issues when it comes to performance. The game was running flawlessly in high resolution on Windows 7 and crashed only once, but since there is a quick save option, it wasn't a big deal. So, make sure to save often and you should be fine.\n\nThe only real problem I have with Shadow Man is the awful final boss fight. The design of the fight is terrible and it is really hard to get a lock on the boss, to be able to shoot him, at least when playing with the keyboard (I have no idea how the gamepad support looks in this game), which resulted in me getting destroyed over and over again. Eventually I got frustrated to the point where I decided to give up. Maybe you will be more lucky and actually beat the game, if you decide to play it. I would highly recommend doing so, because, in conclusion, the game is very good (maybe even one of the best in it's genre?) and I like it a lot.","March 13","true","22.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Thats because ive owned this game since 1999 on N64.\n\nWhen I was a little kid, all of my friends played either Silent hill or Resident evil. Well, Not me. I played Shadow man. There aren't *tons* of things to say about this game, BUT I'm trying to type as detailed a review as possible, so I'm gonna stretch it out. And I'll just break it down into sections and just say what it does right, and what it does wrong. Story: The game starts off by showing you a cutscene ( None of this is spoiler, it's the first five minutes of the game. ) of Jack the ripper talking to himself, explaining that he's killing women because he's looking for immortality in his murders. ( Figuratively speaking, I assume. ) Suddenly, a man appears in his door and offers him the immortality he seeks. But in a literal sense. Jack asks who the man is, and the man replies with: " My name is legion, for we are many ". He tells Jack that hes aware that he's an architecht. To which Jack confirms it. Legion says he's building an asylum in Deadside ( Hell ), and he wants Jack to work on it. And in return, he will give Jack something that will make him immortal. Dark Souls ( Remember, this was 1999, and it was a comic book before that.) Jack accepts his deal, and upon realising he has to die in order to go to Deadside to work on the asylum, Jack shouts out " FOR WE ARE MANY " before impaling himself through his chest. ( The souls would make him immortal in the real world after hes already died. ) And now the game switches to the main character. You play as Michael LeRoi, the most recent host in the lineage of the Shadow Man. ( If you've ever played "The Darkness", it's comparable to that.) The Shadow Man is an ancient Voodoo warrior, whose able to travel back and forth freely between the world of the living, and the world of the dead. You find out that the asylum has finally been finished in modern day, and its funneling all the dark soul energy from dead side into it. You also find out that five serial killers have each acquired immortality through the souls, and are going on murder sprees on earth. So you have to collect as many souls as you can, Kill the serial killers, and deal with the asylum. Gameplay: It's VERY similar to classic tomb raider. So if youre into that stuff, you'll like this gameplay. Setting: I love the setting in this game. Deadside looks and feels like what I imagine hell would look and feel like. And this is a 1999 game. Hell is where everyone goes in this game. Without exception. And it looks like a place of pain and suffering. Lakes of blood everywhere, People turned into twisted demons, Writhing in pain, Butchers with chainsaws hunting you down, Etc Etc. It looks pretty similar to the Hellraiser movies. If youve ever seen that. Controls: Are awkward. But they work just fine. You walk with the arrow keys, and you use you're weapons with Z and X. Voice Acting: Is really strange. In that it varies. Some characters have AWFUL voice acting, some have decent, and some have really good voice acing. Like Jack the ripper, and the snake, Jaunty. It isn't anywhere near the worst voice acting i've ever heard in a game, but it isn't great either. Graphics: Bad. Not REALLY bad, Just bad. But it's old. Things it does right: It is VERY scary, The gameplay is fun, It's challenging, It has a really good story, Jack and Jaunty have REALLY good voice actors, and it never gets boring, even when you're stuck. Things it does wrong: The graphics, Some characters are very bland ( though only a few ), at least a third of the voice acting sucks, It can ONLY run in window mode if you're using windows 10, but it's actually acceptable window mode. It still fills 80% of the screen, only you have a white bar across the top of the screen. That's it. So it isnt a huge deal. And aside from all of that, It has mildly awkward controls. The Last Point: The most important thing to say about this game, is that holy hell it is extremely hard. It's a huge game, you die very easily, and it has very difficult puzzles. You may need to google or use a guide, and if you arent good at remembering locations betwen game sessions, you may need to google up or even print out a map. In Closing: I loved this game as a kid. And even as an adult today, I still kinda like it. So while their ARE other games that are worth alot more for your Five bucks, If youre looking for a classic game, or a new horror game, there's really no reason to not pick this game up. It's scary, It's cheap ( especially if you get it for $1.25 on sale like I did. ), and it's long. Fun for horror fans, puzzle fans, and fans of the classics. Alot of people call this game mediocre, and while I CAN see why they feel that way, I disagree. I think its above average.

The soundtrack has an eerie symphony that is very dark & ominous. The PC version is the definitive version period. Nothing can compare regardless if it when to Sony Playstation, Nintendo 64 or Sega Dreamcast. Thank you Steam for adding this game to your library it's a masterpiece. This is one of my best games, it's also recommended that you have a good PC with plenty of RAM & graphic power to truly enjoy this game. There's alot of backtracking in this game but it is only due to special abilities that you may not have had earlier in the game. I played the Dreamcast version but at certain points in the game the sound was very glitchy can you say Cathedral of Pain? The mouse & keyboard playing this game is key to this game & it's simple not hard at all. If anything the mouse & keyboard is the best feature for Shadow Man. This game is not for the faint of heart by no means. The story behind Shadow Man is deep & compelling & will engulf you. One man between both worlds, no soul, A dead man is walking, Voodoo is the revenge & Shadow man will stop at nothing but take souls of his enemies for he embraces it.","December 23, 2013","true","131.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was a ride! It's awesome to be able to fire it up here 13 years later and jump back into one of my all-time favorite games. With some games you've played from the past, you jump in and they turn out to be a shell of what you remembered; this is not the case with Shadow Man.\n\nThe game keeps you locked in with the inhabitants of Deadside lurking around every corner. At 30+ hours of gameplay, this is one of the longer games from it's time period. It's full of surprise encounters that will keep you looking over your shoulder at all times, Shadowgun at the ready.\n\nThe graphics are actually pretty decent, especially when compared to other 64 games. Be mindful though, this is a game from 1999; so don't be expecting your latest Crysis engine visuals. An added bonus, is that this game is indeed compatible with the Xbox 360 controller!\n\nThis game would be a tough cookie NOT to recommend.

This game is the PC Port version of that title. It was also released on the N64 and Playstation but they were little more than watered down versions. Between the two, the N64 was the more stable and easier to play through version.\n\nAs you go through the game you collect "dark souls" throughout the land of the dead, known as deadside.\n\nThe dark souls have two functions:\n1. Increase the amount of damage you can charge into your basic weapon, the shadowgun. The gun can be charged like Megaman X's X-buster for increased damage shots. Higher levels of shadow increase the max damage of a fully charged shot and increase the distance it travels too.\n2. Enable you open "coffin gates" which can only be opened if you have enough dark souls, which is measured by the levels of shadow on your shadow meter. Different coffin gates have different shadow level requirements. These gates seal off the accessible areas and levels of the game.\n\nYou will also find other useful items ranging from keys, other guns and voodoo weapons and voodoo artifacts as you attempt to stop five serial killers and their unknown master from unleashing an army of immortal zombies from deadside to the land of the living, liveside.\n\nThis is a third person shooter with dual wielding capability. You will wield two weapons to kill your enemies however most of the enemies you kill won't drop a health pickup unless you execute them with your basic weapon, the Shadowgun. You can still kill enemies using different combos of weapons but the enemies won't drop a health pickup after they die. To execute an enemy you just shoot it until it enters a sort of "stun-state" then you shoot it one more time with your shadowgun to gain a health pickup when the enemy dies.\n\nYou can hold down a button for a nice little lock-on feature that doubles as a Doom-style strafe. Therefore you can sidestep enemy fire as you missile them to death with your weapons. Although this is a third person shooter some of the more agile enemies are a little easier to shoot using the free look. Don't hesitate to use it if the lock on is causing you to shoot at the floor or at a wall while you're locked on to something on the other side.\n\nThe game has a strong horror theme to it. You're an immortal voodoo demi-god that has to travel to deadside(basically hell.) and you fight zombies and disfigured creatures. That's just the first few hours of the game. You fight nastier stuff like torture-loving psychos, asylum retainers that sound like wild boars (Don't ask.), and even serial killers later on. A “few” things will try to jump out at you but it's rare actually. The highlights of the horror come from the atmosphere and background music. Stages like the Asylum's Playrooms and the Asylum's Undercity are really going to make your skin crawl.\n\nLike the original pc version it still has gamepad support. I can't imagine playing this on a keyboard honestly.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, most stuff is easy to go through. Dying just sets you back a little bit or to where your closest teddy bear warp point was. The only real hard part is just the final boss battle's skill cap is astronomical compared to everything else you fight in the game. It will surprise you.\n\nOutside of this the only other noteworthy feature added is the option to watch previously seen cutscenes.\n\nThe only detail that will probably turn you away from the game is the age. Most first person shooter games outclass this one but during its time it was ahead of other games of its kind.\n\nIn the end, this gem is worth your time. It's also good for a scare.\n\n8/10\n\nFixes:\n*You can disregard this if you have no experience with the other versions of this game*\nYou can kill the animals in the Bayou level and in the Prison level the prison guards' heads still explode and are killable, like in the N64 version.\n\nOn the Original PC version you couldn't kill either of these enemies because it was a horrible attempt at Acclaim to dodge censors. Double thumbs up for this fix because the prison level is a god forsakened eternal nightmare to finish without being able to kill the guards without this fix.","January 28, 2014","true","18.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/recommended/251770/","Lintire","Lintire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/","194 products in account","Shadow Man is a 1999 action-adventure game in the vein of the old-school Tomb Raider games, brought to us from the long-defunct Acclaim Entertainment.\n\nI'm a stern believer in the idea that a game does not have a shelf-life. It was either always good, or it was never particularly good to begin with and you were simply making do. What flaws Shadow Man does have, and it does have flaws, don't stem from age but from some timeless design.\n\nShadow Man has a Metroidvania approach to level design. Maze-like levels, with long winding tunnels and massive, multiple-pathed layouts, some of which require abilities to access that you won't acquire for hours yet, Sprawling complexes and perpetually grey wastelands with walls so high and paths so twisty so you can end up in a circle before you realise it.\n\nThis is where Shadow Man's biggest flaw comes into play: it doesn't have a map. With level design traditionally designed to confound you and with levels a hell of a lot bigger than you'd expect, getting lost, missing a required entrance or just some small but required detail is a constant threat and hindrance to progress. This can easily become headache inducing as you're combing levels for the umpteenth time searching for a clue to progress, in a game with so many reused texture assets that every go-over just exacerbates the problem.\n\nThis lack of a map slam dunks Shadow Man from "cult classic" to "hard sell".\n\nFortunately that is the biggest of the game's problems and if you can look past that the rest easy to glaze past. It does suffer from some very underwhelming boss fights, an aspect that Acclaim Entertainment was easily infamous for, and the combat itself never evolves from "lock on and strafe/kite while firing charged Shadowgun shots".\n\nWriting - both dialogue and plot - is easily one of the game's stronger features. You play as Micheal LeRoi, an English Lit. college drop-out whose desperation resulted in the death of his family and a stint as an amnesiac hitman, who now serves as the Shadow Man for Mama Nettie, an immortal voodoo warrior for an immortal voodoo priestess haunted by his past and his own bloodied hands. Even on paper it sounds fantastic, and it's almost fully realized ingame.\n\nMicheal LeRoi suffers from some inconsistent writing. At the drop of a hat he'll switch from your usual braindead action-adventure protagonist to narrating dark scenes in prose so purple it's practically ultraviolet, belying his English Lit. education. Micheal LeRoi as an action hero is not nearly as compelling as Micheal LeRoi as a narrator, and it's a shame that Acclaim Studios Teesside didn't manage to fully incorporate the latter into the gameplay.\n\nAntagonists don't far much better. Despite dealing with some hideously and respectably dark themes - sexual assault, suicide, mental retardation - "The Five" come across ingame as a bunch of giggling bufoonish comic book villains. Which while understandable given the source material, completely undermines the themes and ideas behind them. "Legion" especially is straight-up camp.\n\nArt direction is fantastic - the dark and oppressive Deadside atmosphere never lets up for a moment, helped by both that and some truly excellent sound design (as anyone who has played through the infamous Playrooms can attest to) and the locales go wild towards the end with the completely different Liveside areas introduced.\n\nAn utter lack of handholding - while resulting in that map problem mentioned earlier - also means that exploring is its own reward. It really captures the spirit of exploration, where every area feels like a surprise and the effort put into finding it feels worth it. The game expecting you to explore in order to earn its secrets even helps it along.\n\nAs an aside, there is partial controller support, but emphasis on the "partial". Half the buttons on the gamepad I was using, the game didn't recognize. But given the relatively simple control scheme, rebindind the stupid defaults and using the gamepad anyway was easy enough. There was also a Windows 8 glitch that required running a 3rd party program to force the game to run fullscreen.\n\nShadow Man is a hard sell. It has undeniable, headache-inducing problems. But despite its shortcomings it remains an incredibly interesting game, definitely worth checking out with those with either a good sense of direction, or those who don't mind getting lost.","March 20, 2015","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Such as gripping through ledges, and end up releasing it even though i never let go. Another with grabbing ledge, but when u climb up u sometimes either fall down or somehow go through it which forces u to either restart from your last save point or use a teddy bear to teleport away from the glitch. Another glitch encountment was when i grab the ledge and move to the side, i apparently stop moving in the middle of it while my character is moving sideways. I had to hold down the key for a LONG time just for Michael to go through the glitch. There are some on important areas as well, you cant miss it.\n\nThose encounters are happening in game quite OFTEN, making the game even harder as it is to complete and feels impossible with the glitches/bugs in the way. I dont know about other versions, but steam version i would not recommend buying it from.\n\nWhat i can say is its possible to beat the steam version with glitches, all it takes is patience and some strategy on how to get around it.\n\nAside from the majority glitch issues, the game is really fun and boss battles are quite challenging indeed.

It worth playing for as long as you can bare but be warned: controlls and mechanics outdated. You may be better to just watch the cutscenes and run throughs on you tube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seK3BQF5wsg\n\nThe dark and twisting world of this game is probably the most psychologically atmospheric I've ever played. Full of barren grey mountains, like a wasteland, and moaning zombies, Deadside is all at once dreary and enthralling. The massive amount of detail and varying architecture combines to form a huge, impressive, if not psychologically disturbing, world that seems to be dripping in a serene aura.

Huge temples are filled with flowing lava, arcane wall designs, life-size statues, and waterfalls of blood.\n\nIts one of the most mesmerizing and terrifyingly macabre titles out there.

Game isn't too hard to follow now that actually have an attention span, but the controls are still not very good.  The graphics are obviously poor, but for an old game that is acceptable.  When I started playing my resolution was screwy, so I had to change some setting in the exe just to see what was happening.  The shooting, don't even get me started with the shooting in this game.  Alright I'll start myself on the shooting, it's terrible!  If I want to aim I have to switch to a whole new screen basically, and then in that screen you have a small reticle and nothing else.  That would be fine if I could move in that screen, or if the shooting key wasn't by default something so awkward as X.  Another thing that instantly made me almost want to turn the game off was all the unnecessary sounds.  There are wind chime sounds everywhere, but no wind chimes!  I know I could just turn off the sound, but if I wanted to hear the story I wouldn't get that.

The story line is original and entertaining (and great voice actors), but the graphics were made for original Playstation, so they look horrible by today's standard.  I would love to see a remake of this game by a good studio.\n\nFlorinescu- Right on, I agree.  Daevynn- Yes, PC version looks as good as graphics from 1999, LOL.  Deadjack, I agree that this game was great in its day, which is why I purchased it again for PC through Steam.  I also agree that the voice overs were all great choices- points I made in my review.  Thanks for the recap and the history lesson.  Have you played it on PC?  The keyboard controls are HORRIBLE.  Also, I don't have to know the full history to see that the graphics do not stack up to today's standard.  This review is to meant to help someone decide if they should buy it on steam and what they might expect, which is a great story, well-rounded characters, and excellent voice acting.  However, I think they rushed this game to steam without much effort into controls, so the game is nearly unplayable.  Don't critique my review if you haven't played it on steam!  This game is a jewel worth playing on Playstation, Dreamcast, or whatever throw-back console you still have lying around, but please don't waste your money on this version delivered through Steam.","November 25, 2013","false","1.0"," 11 of 57 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","11","57","0","5"

Funny enough I ended up playing it way more than he did. Fact is I played it casually over the next several years. Never quite got far enough to beat it. I had gotten far enough that I was close. I was fairly young then. As an adult now I was excited upon my discovery of 'Shadow Man' on Steam. I would strongly recommend this game to anyone with a decent computer that liked this game on consoles. The textures are smoother, everything feels more controllable, and the game options are slightly greater (in comparison to the N64 version). I also noticed a few small, subtle differences in certain areas that made it feel a little more new (again, in comparison to the N64 version). The sound is fantastic. Over the past several weeks each of my roommates have wondered into my room while I was playing. Claiming they heard the horrific sounds and were curious. They were all greatly interested in what I was playing. Several commented on its dark vibe, creepy music, and downright frightening sounds.

This game may seem cheesy at first because of it's age but if you keep exploring you will discover a really well designed voodoo game unlike any other. The music is so cool that it just stays with you. Before there were open world games there was Shadow Man which was one of the first to offer non-linear game play. The mazes and puzzles are so deep that you will not be able to complete this game without some kind of help. Even then...there are some very challenging levels that will have you pulling your hair out at first! Just keep in mind that with patience and practice comes perfect! I really wish that they would remake this game and keep it mostly the same except for better graphics and newer voice acting. It would still make an incredible game now days. I hear Wesley Snipes is available...Colm Meaney as Jaunty...Pam Grier as Nettie. One of the five reminds me of Robert DeNiro in Cape Fear.

This game may seem cheesy at first because of it's age but if you keep exploring you will discover a really well designed voodoo game unlike any other. The music is so cool that it just stays with you. Before there were open world games there was Shadow Man which was one of the first to offer non-linear game play. The mazes and puzzles are so deep that you will not be able to complete this game without some kind of help. Even then...there are some very challenging levels that will have you pulling your hair out at first! Just keep in mind that with patience and practice comes perfect! I really wish that they would remake this game and keep it mostly the same except for better graphics and newer voice acting. It would still make an incredible game now days. I hear Wesley Snipes is available...Colm Meaney as Jaunty...Pam Grier as Nettie. One of the five reminds me of Robert DeNiro in Cape Fear. The Lizard King reminds me of Michael Keaton in Desperate Measures. Some definite influences in this game but it has way more originality. If you decide to give it a shot, do NOT forget to save and...good luck to you...you WILL need it!","September 29, 2014","true","41.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only frustraiting things are controls and mouselook - but what can you expect from a 16 year old N64 game? Other than that Shadow Man works really well.\n\nFor those who don't know what to expect from the SM: gameplay is pretty much Darksiders/The Legend of Zelda, which is a pretty good thing.\n\nStory is entertaining, by the way, and the voice acting is good, but sometimes hilarious ("SHADOW MON", "HI, MOCHAEL").","February 9, 2015","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Funny enough I ended up playing it way more than he did. Fact is I played it casually over the next several years. Never quite got far enough to beat it. I had gotten far enough that I was close. I was fairly young then. As an adult now I was excited upon my discovery of 'Shadow Man' on Steam. I would strongly recommend this game to anyone with a decent computer that liked this game on consoles. The textures are smoother, everything feels more controllable, and the game options are slightly greater (in comparison to the N64 version). I also noticed a few small, subtle differences in certain areas that made it feel a little more new (again, in comparison to the N64 version). The sound is fantastic. Over the past several weeks each of my roommates have wondered into my room while I was playing. Claiming they heard the horrific sounds and were curious. They were all greatly interested in what I was playing. Several commented on its dark vibe, creepy music, and downright frightening sounds. I would like to add the price was not asking much.","December 17, 2014","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yet i'm not 100 % sure about if Shadow Man would work on some newer PCs.

The Devs really took advantage of the 3D space and made a deep web that at times can make you feel like such a jackass for getting lost but also like a champion when you come accross that one door you didn't notice that happens to hold a weapon capable of clearing a room a hell spawn.\n\nThis game does a better job of making you feel like your in hell than Doom. Now I don't say that comparing the action because this is an over the shoulder horror adventure but the environment, it's music, the fantastic lore all come together to make it hard for you to play with all the lights out.\n\n\n","May 20","true","30.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
