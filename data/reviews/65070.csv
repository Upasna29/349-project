I slaughtered everything in my path every time. Betting full amount I can each time I had copious amounts of money, bought the best I could and once I reached the boss, well... he was too easy.\n\nThe customising part is minimal. Has a few set things you can do. Things such as wheel size can affect speed so there are small factors that can come into play but you're never that close in races for it to matter other than you own personal best 1/4 mile times etc. As for styling you can do a few basic things but nothing major. Paint, wheels, tires, ride height, window tints, and some special things like gold trim.\n\nThere is a mode where you can use hydraulics to complete in competitions. I can't get it to score any points in the freestyle no matter how much I try. Probably bugged. It's fun to play around with hydros for a few mins in the test mode but it gets boring after that.\n\nIt has a score system for reputation for each race. No idea what that does. I think it might affect multiplier in the hydro mode but again, can't score, so useless.\n\nI was hoping it would get more difficult as the game went on but nothing changed. It was the same from start to finish.","December 20, 2014","false","4.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Lemur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nalgasdlemur/","949 products in account","This game is kind of endearingly awful. It looks like something that came out ten years ago, the UI is terrible, it's full of typos, and it doesn't have much to pass for gameplay. You get to pimp out non-trademark-infringing knock-offs of classic cars (Gazelles and Walkers instead of old school Impalas and El Caminos) and then race them or show off how ridiculous your hydraulics are, except both types of events have very little depth and kind of iffy controls. If you don't win, you will have absolutely no idea why you didn't win or what you should've done differently. The rate you do get money from winning is quite low and makes it feel like it's meant to have microtransactions so you can actually afford to upgrade your car in less than six months of playing. It's also very easy to completely run out of money if you buy the wrong stuff and then lose a couple races, and the amount they give you to get going again if that happens is so low that you might as well just start over.\n\nThat said, the keyboard controls for driving are still somehow better than the keyboard vehicle controls for a lot of mainstream games, especially console ports, even though they're kind of meh, which should make a lot of major publishers/developers ashamed of themselves. And I still can't entirely dislike this game, because it has that kind of charm to it that only comes from people trying really hard to make something and completely and utterly failing to succeed.","January 27, 2014","false","0.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/65070/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1772 products in account","Before going into Ride 'em Low, you must realize and accept that it is a low budget niche title. The production values are very low, and the mechanics are quite limited for a racing/driving game. Being a fan of racing games and having grown up in a city where modified cars were a part of its culture, this game quickly caught my attention. Sadly, it did not fully satisfy my expectations. The pleasant surprise arrived when I noticed the many parallels to the Street Rod 1 and Street Rod 2 DOS games I played many hours as a kid. The premise and mechanics are very similar, and all three games also share similar problems and limitations. You start the game with a lump sum of cash, head over to the car dealer, and buy a classic muscle car of your choice. From there, you will begin racing other drivers and then modifying your vehicle with your race earnings. You will also be able to gain respect points with each race win. On the other hand, races that are lost will decrease your respect points and decrease your savings. I have found little to no value of having any amount of respect. What matters most in Ride 'em Low is money. It will get you part upgrades, new cars, cosmetic changes, and best of all, it will move you up the drivers' ranking. The game relies heavily on your income while driving skills have nearly zero impact on the outcome of races, unless you are competing in the top ten. In addition, car part upgrades do not scale well at all in comparison to your direct competitors in the driver ranking. Because of these flaws, progression in Ride 'em Low means you will be forced to grind wins for money against lower ranked drivers with much inferior cars in comparison to yours. After a few hours of grinding, the game suddenly clicks together, and you will be progressing through the ranks and acquiring upgrades enjoyably. After much racing and climbing up the ranks, you will quickly realize that maxing out all available upgrades for your current car are not enough, and you must purchase a better automobile. The feeling of improvement as you buy new parts or upgrade your existing ones is satisfying. There are even subtle audio differences depending on what parts you have equipped. Edging out an opponent for a win that you have lost to previously is quite fun and rewarding. As I mentioned before, winning races has very little to do with your gained skills as a driver, but everything to do with how expensive and powerful your vehicle has become through part upgrades. With that said, there is some minor experimenting with tweaking your car's gear differential in order to achieve better overall performance. As you calibrate this, you will be able to go on test drives and find out how well the changes have impacted the car's acceleration. This can be fun after each major upgrade, and depending on the parts, differential configurations do make a difference in beating an opponent in certain events. Which introduces another major flaw in the game. There is a severe lack of tracks to race on. Even though there are four different race modes, each utilizing alternate track variations, they are far from exciting, and do not feel like an actual event. There aren't any city drivers around, ever. If the developers had added city drivers throughout the tracks and some interaction with the police, the game would have been so much better. This goes in line with the rest of the game's lack of polish and content. It's also very clear that there is much to be desired graphically. The car models have had the most attention, while the tracks and other objects around them have low resolutions and look like they are about fifteen years out of date. Competing against your opponents as you go up to the number one rank can be fun, but not in all race modes. Strangely enough, drag racing is the race mode I prefer to take part in. It's fast, satisfying, and puts your parts tweaking to the test in their purest of forms. There are three other longer race modes around very bland and uninteresting tracks, but I resentfully participated in them. The cars available to the players are all very large and heavy beasts of classic machinery. They handle, feel, and move like massively heavy boats on quicksand, and racing them around tight corners and chicanes is not fun in any way. The car physics while racing are decent, but the weight and feel of the cars as you turn are not fitting to how they should handle and perform after being fine tuned with expensive, maximum performance parts and engines. In Ride 'em Low the only simulation aspect is left to car part modification and upgrades. I have hit a solid cement wall going over 215 miles per hour a few times, backed up, and continued on the race without any problems. I have also been involved in or witnessed some extremely unrealistic but funny crashes, only to see the cars land back on the road and continue driving to win the race. Going back to the game not requiring very much of your driver skills and track experience, the true opponent challenges will only exist when you reach each of the events' top ten driver ranking. Then, the developers opted to provide you with some artificial difficulty, as many of your opponents will be driving the exact same or inferior cars and go much faster than you, even if your top of the line car has maximum upgrades and the absolute best parts. There is also some senseless performance instability coming from your opponents. Sometimes you will have to drive the same challenger more than once, and their performance will become better or worse, seemingly at random even though they are the same driver with the same car as before. The uninspired tracks also suffer from some bugs. Sometimes your car will be stuck to a light post or even a sidewalk. The only way to continue is to go to the menu and restart the race. The game client itself also has some awful problems regarding the occasional crash and the operating system's sound. After each time I play Ride 'em Low, it causes severe issues with the system sound, completely muting most of the channels, in addition to producing some very strange noises during gameplay. The only way to get the system's sound back to normal is to restart Windows. This is clearly an issue tied to Ride 'em Low alone, as I have not experienced anything like it from any other game or software. Besides the main racing events, there is also a hydraulics competition. In this event, there is no racing involved at all. Your task is to equip your vehicle with hydraulic suspensions and perform for a high score. While the idea is novel and there aren't that many games that provide the player with such a genuine lowrider experience, once you do three or four of these, there isn't really a reason to participate again. The main event in the game is truly the actual racing, and your objective is to reach the number one spot in all four racing competitions. There is a surprising amount of fun to be had tuning and racing classic muscle cars, and the game thankfully does not outstay its welcome. If you can ignore and overlook some serious flaws, and if you liked Street Rod 1 and Street Rod 2, then Ride 'em Low is at least worth a try.\n\nRide 'em Low is okay.","March 12, 2014","true","17.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I expected good graphics when I saw that, I was wrong\n- Graphics look like a 90's game, some light effects and shadows that seem to be more modern, but it still sucks.\n- Gameplay seemed promising from the description but it's just awefull. Racing sucks, car control is bad, turning just makes you lose speed, which is low anyways, you can't hit or do anything to your opponent, you will always race in straight lines, car upgrades have sick prices and you get close to no upgrade. you have to bet your money on races on straight lines and you will lose to opponents with weaker cars if you don't upgrade enough. There is no fun in the gameplay, that's the worst part. Play it only if you want to see some low riders cars and if yo uare bored to look at google images (which have a lot better graphics btw).\n\nOne of the worst games I ever played","October 28, 2014","false","0.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

You get what you pay for though and it does have room for improvement, like having a cruise mode, burnout competition, customization(pin striping, custom trim, murals, custom paint jobs like lace and panel, custom interior, custom character), car shows, car clubs, create events, change keys for controls etc. . . I have to say this is a challenging game, you have to know what you're doing in order to win and trust me you will lose and even when you have no more money the game gives you $250. In the beginning you really have to choose if you want your car to be a "Racer" or a "Hopper" for you can not have both. If you choose to go with a Racer, modify engine, gearbox(A.K.A. Transmission), fuel, tires, suspension and differential, Bet wisely. As for a Hopper buy the best or second best hydro kit and practice like crazy. Also another important thing is to NEVER SELL YOUR CAR, you get jipped and end up with not enough for another one, if so delete your game profile and start over. Trust me you are gonna have to work really hard to get anything out of this game.\n\nOn the other hand if you want a game based strictly on lowriders, I would recommend "TheLowriderGame" IT'S FREE ---->www.thelowridergame.com/index.php","June 20, 2014","true","8.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Probably not, right?\n\nGraphics\nEven though it has been a while since i've played NFS:Underground, I would say graphically Ride 'Em Low is somewhere on the same level as NFS:U was back in 2003. Personally, I don't mind if a game is not up to date on todays standards, as long as it brings something new to the table.\n\nGameplay\nRide 'Em Low starts like most race games these days; Buy a second hand car, tweak it and start racing. Unlike NFS:U, you do not get to drive around the city (as in freemode). The races themselves are pretty boring compared to other race games and I can't even name anything great about them. It seems that if you tuned your car well enough, you will win the race otherwise you will simply lose.\n\nSound/Music\nObviously a low budget game can't get the licenses for music like EA could with NFS but in this game the music is worse than the original Need For Speed game. Uninspiring Music which will most likely annoy you after a few game rounds. The  other sounds are nothing special either.\n\nConclusion\nRide 'Em Low is only interested to people who do not own and have never played any good race game over the past 15 years or own the game because of some bundle like I did.\n\n\n\n","December 9, 2014","false","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I think the developers should release an update or even a DLC. I mean really four tracks? Of course there are different varieties of tracks but they all feel unfinished. There is also the lowrider competitions in which you have three modes: hop, freestyle, dance. The more points you score the more cash you get.\n\nThere is also a multiplier that you get by applying upgrades from the "special" section in the modification tab. But I must say there alot of upgrades. Still with four tracks and one lowrider arena I still managed to suck up countless hours of fun from this game, just annihilating every car in sight by taking over the lead from the start. There is no greater feeling then that. The game is a MUST HAVE for lowrider lovers, but it is fun for average players that just wanna race n' stuff.\n\nI have to say that I recommend this game, it can't be fun for everyone but it can be for some people (and lowrider fans).\nIt still has potential.

It was decent but I wouldn't fully recommend buying this at full price.","March 19, 2014","false","29.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

While the goal is noble the implementation is lacking and leaves the entire experience feeling hollow.\n\nSome of this is on the content being presented, a drag race is by definition going straight so the play can just numbly hold down the accelerator.  Races are against single cars without any rubberbanding so you know early on if you'll win or not.  This may be accurate but in game form it's uninteresting.\n\nThe hydraulics gameplay of car dancing is hilarious as you DDR your car through a set routine.  Freestyle events appear to be bugged which was dissapointed due to it being so ridiculous to make the car hop around.","February 22","false","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
