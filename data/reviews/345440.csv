Always a little cautious about horror games. 1) Because I'm not a huge fan and 2) Seem to be a dime a dozen trying to cash-in on the craze. Can happily say thus far Vapour has surprised me a great deal. While it's not without it's flaws and I will get slaughtered for daring to even mention it. Had strong flashbacks to games like Hexen and Heretic during my playtime. Mostly because of the level design and puzzle integration rather then monsters.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFZWoS9WByo\nGameplay is straight forward enough. You play the role of a psychotic warlock known as 'Charles' who is more the a little peeved off at being kept captive and tortured for the better part of eternity. Broken free from purgatory he now must make his way through the borders of hell in some vain attempt to reach earth, reclaim his life and seek revenge on those who sent him there in the first place. Plays out rather well and more story then expected, cursing is a little overused just for effect but it's not entirely out of place.\n\nGamepad didn't work by default but it's unity so controls could probably be rebound through the launcher, keyboard+mouse controls were great. Problems were the lack of in-game options since unfortunately mouse sensitivity was through the roof and I had to tone it down via dpi settings instead. FOV sliders would be a welcome addition as well. As someone who is prone to motion sickness thankfully was able to play without vomiting though felt screen space could use expanding.\n\nIf you enjoy horror or dark adventure games it's worth checking out. Just keep in mind it contains more then a few jump scares and it's not just about 'running and gunning' as the store page might suggest . Few minor bugs that should be addressed in patches as well. Devs have plans to add future (free) content so we'll see how that goes, as this is first impressions cannot say how much gametime Vapour currently contains. Cheers folks. :)\n\nLikes:\nNon-linear level design\nBioshock-esque magic system.\nPuzzles that require some thought\nCreative monsters\n\nDislikes:\nPhysics bugs\nLoad times could be improved.\nRepeated jump scares (uses 1-3 effects so far)\nNo Achievements\n\nNOTES:\nGametime isn't logged correctly since I play offline.\nDeveloper provided a steam code. Never changes my thoughts.","July 3, 2015","true","4.3"," 66 of 94 people (70%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","70","66","94","6","5"

The game itself when you first play it feels like DOOM slapped with a bit of Elder Scrolls with the magic abilities, although the game does feature a collection of horrifying and quite disturbing monsters, jump scares are also in this game and the devs make a good use of them as well.\n\nTrying to understand this game might be difficult at first. There is no real helpful system in the beginning unless you ask a developer or someone who's played what to do. I had to ask the creator numerous times, " What do I do now? "\nHowever later in the game it shows small clips of where your objectives are located. Though the game still does not easily map out the locations with a minimap or compass which would help with the navigation of the game which may be it's biggest fault.\n\nPROS -\n\n- Interesting atmosphere\n- Unique concepts\n- Challenging enemies\n- Interactive story driven campaign\n- Suspensful horror with a mix of amnesia type feeling.\n- Dark and ominous music fit for this game.\n\nCONS -\n\n- No Minimap, system of navigation.\n- No real backstory of why you are in purgatory.\n- Difficult and sometimes glitchy campaign\n\n\nI'd have to give this game a rating of a 7.4/10 It's not a perfect game but it's a good one you should pick up. Hopefully the developers can add a minimap or navigation system soon to make the game a lot more enjoyable to everyone who has high hopes for it's future development.","August 16, 2015","true","12.6"," 38 of 48 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","38","48","2","0"

Most of the old school elements were there, flooding rooms, boulder runs, switch puzzles, as well as the old memory / tune puzzle (Much like Fallout 3's musical tune puzzle). The enemies are variable and quite a challenge to boot, my favorite battle was the first witch, while it might of been a glitch ,she spawned while the room was flooding forcing me to use the extra rooms to replenish my mana and health and then haveing to scamble to solve the puzzle before I drown after killing her, quite a challenge indeed. I loved the use of secret mana and health pick-ups, quite a nessecity to enable you to defeat some of those irratable wraiths. I was surprised when I reached the end of the game and could not reach the last room because some relics were off the path, a pleasant surprise to have to backtrack to find some secrets you missed. I quit this game twice, as in to the desktop and five minutes later found myself swearing and trudging through the puzzles again convinced that it was possible to beat that irratable wraith, even if he can drift through objects and screw you over almost instantly, if you have decided to replenish at the wrong time. Anyway I really liked the game and for a very small indie development team for their first game not a bad game at all, anyone who has the time, patients and persistence to finish this game will be rewarded with nestalgia of the old school games and when the gameplay made the game and not the story.Not to mention I played this game in one sitdown from 9pm - 5am, 8 hours of enjoyable and challenging fun.","August 13, 2015","true","8.4"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","1"

The level design is one of my favorite things about this game, I ran around for quite some time trying to figure out where to go next. I would compare the level design to Duke Nukem 3D or Shadow Warrior (the old one).\n\nExploration and your memory will serve you well in this game. and you may have to try some difficult jumping, but don't give up you'll find the way eventually. Graphically the game looks great, it uses Unity 5 and has some really great texture work. The enemies all look very good and most are not just one hit kills.\n\nOn to a few gripes I have, Minimal UI can leave you guessing what items you have collected (keys and so on) and your health is (I believe) shown by the glowing color on your arm. I realize the developers wanted a minimal UI but there is also no real explanation of the elements on the screen. Hopefully this will be addressed in a future update or patch.\n\nOverall I really recommend this game if you like Hexxen, Duke Nukem 3D, or Shadow Warrior. The Devs are really nice and are quick to answer any questions you might have and talk to you about any issues you may have running the game.","July 3, 2015","true","5.2"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","1"

It is a game so terrible it is hard to pin point where to start even discussing the issues present. So for no reason at all I shall mention the dialogue. It is simply attrocious and is what one may expect from an angsty teen who thinks simply swearing will make what is being said "more extreme". It really is embarrasingly bad, likewise the voice actor seems embarrassed to be even muttering the lines, with his delivery lacking any sense of conviction.\n\nGraphically the game doesn't even begin to look acceptable. Not only is it technically underwhelming and would have been 10 years ago, but its art design is beyond insipidly uninspired. The game also seems to enjoy crashing, for example every single time I have tried to exit the game it has cause the game to crash, this may be a minor issue, but for those using a controller in a tv set up this is an issue that is hard to overlook as it will require you to go get a mouse to continue using your system.\n\nThe game originaly ran incredibly poorly, which when it looks this bad was quite simply unnacceptable, thankfully the devs have released a patch that saw and over doubling in performance on my set up, though I must wonder why it wasn't pushed back to allow for it to launch running like it currently does. I do feel that it probably should run far better given what is on display but it is now acceptable.\n\nLikewise whilst the game controlls as one would expect with a keyboard and mouse, those looking to play with a controller may find themselves having issues as when I pressed foward my character would move foward and left, or foward and right, and was unable to move just foward using an xbox one controller (I uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers to check in what I feel was a reasonable manner that it wasn't a problem caused on my end).\n\nIn spite of all the issues if a game had compelling gameplay it may be worth watching once the crashes where ironed out if the gameplay was any good. Sadly it is not here. Animations are barely present as you run and your hands float in a set position in front of you. Likewise the map design seems to be a matter of just put stuff everywhere in a complete random matter that is entirely unintuitive to navigate. Objectives also seem to be randomly known by the players character and typically involve finidng something in the environment that you don't know what looks like and as previously mentioned will just be thrown somewhere at random. Put simply I originally played the game for only thirty minutes and then played again once the new patch released, which did fix my performance complaints, but did not fix the lack of enjoyment I was deriving.\n\nStay very, very far away. I can't even see how this disaster could be enjoyed in the "it's so bad it is funny" kind of way. To the credit of the devs they have fixed some of the issue (most notably the performance woes) but I find the game to be so fundementally unenjoyable to play, I can't see patches being able to resolve without the game simply being remade.","September 26, 2015","false","0.7"," 31 of 57 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","31","57","5","6"

First of all if your a fan of the Build Engine games (especially Blood) then this game is for you, there is also a good measure of modern Horror mixed in. Not just Jump Scares but a very unsettling and creepy environment as well, not to mention the few areas that just make you plain nervous.\n\nFor those not familiar with the Build Engine games, if you like Action/Adventure FPS games that give you maze like non-linear level design with cool weapons, awesome enemies, some intense puzzles and bit of platforming then this game is for you.\n\nThe Horror aspect is also nice and strong, some good Jump Scares and a very eerie environment, dont even get me started on the Boss enemy, that thing is straight from HELL itself.\n\nAnother thing that I like is the nice clean approach the devs took for the HUD and showing Player Info (health, mana/ammo etc.) it really draws you into the game, dont want to spoil too much though, you need to play it yourself.\n\nExtremely well done for a small Indie studio from South Africa and if this is their first commercial game I'm very interested to see what they do next.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Amazing level design that will have you exploring for hours.\n-Puzzles are insane.\n-Variety in game mechanics (Shooting/Fighting, Exploration, Puzzle Solving, Platforming).\n-Really pretty and complex for an indie game.\n-Unique representation of Player Info (Health, Mana/Ammo etc).\n-Frightening Jump Scares and an eerie environment all round.\n-Awesome enemy designs.\n-Combat is nice and varied.\n-Great attention to detail on the spells and the environment.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n-Well it is an Indie Game so I guess dont expect AAA, but as an Indie Game, these devs really created something special.\n- Another possible con, It isnt everyone's cup of tea. It is one of those games where you might struggle to figure out where to go or what to do sometimes and some might see some of the deaths as a bit cheap, but in my opinion thats one of the things that makes it an awesome games, I really like a challenge and having to figure everything out so the sense of reward is amazing, additionally there are optional in-game hints that help quite a bit, for those that want them.\n-Some people might find some of the scares too much of the Jumpy variety but I love Jump Scares, especially if they are done well and there are also a lot of other different types of scares in the game and a very creepy atmosphere throughout.\n\n8.5/10\n\nNot even done with Part 1 yet and I cant wait for Part 2, definitely going on my list of favourite indie games.","October 3, 2015","true","4.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

Not the worst story I've ever heard. Sure, it's a little corny, but it gives me a goal as a character and a bit of background. Around the end of the intro sequence I spin in the boat a few more times (it's about all you can do on the boat) and suddenly I find this weird visual glitch that throws my camera into an absolute chaos of spiraling.\n\nI get out of the boat, load the next area, test out a few controls... and by zooming in with right click I not only start doing a barrel roll, but I lose control of my ability to turn my character.

Now i LOVE horror games, in fact i only have a few games in my steam library that arnt horror. And after reading the comments for this game i was REALLY looking forward to it i was STOKED. I waited for a sale downloaded and waited containing my excitement while watching the game download. Then i started it up for the first time... enjoyed the intro boat ride down blood river... and the good times ended there...\n\nThis is one of those, where the hell do i go, what the hell do i do kind of games! There is NOTHING scarey about this game, no im serious NOTHING!!! The only "graphic" imagry is this guy covered in nails, or needles or something who keeps flashing into your screen while your trying to plan the damn game. And no i dont mean he appears in front of you i mean your screen literally changes in mid game to show you this guy. Oh and the game is incredably short, if you know what to do it should take you less than 2 hours to beat this.\n\nNow i just have one serious question, WHY IS THIS RATED ADULTS ONLY?!!??  There was no sexual themes, there was no gore, no graphic imagry, there was a tiny bit a nuity that you cant even make out but thats it. That WARNING sign is VERY misleading it made me think i was delving into a game so violent and disturbing i would have to send steam a picture of my ID upon purchase. I guess the F word has new definition that means something REALLY bad because thats about the only "adult" thing in this game.","September 29, 2015","false","1.6"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","2","8","2","1"

At some point this may turn out to be a fantastic horror game but that time is not now.  Controls are so buggy its just not fun, you have to jump up moutain cliffs with no idea where your headed which leads to some of the most frustrating moments I have had in gaming in a long time. I too was throwing out cuss words but not because I was scared. The jump scares are triggered and looped, so if you just sit there after a certain amount of time ...boo...it was cool , at first, . The art style and characters are neat looking but so irratic its just not ready yet...and the first boss or mini boss called the hell lord is a joke not because its easy or hard its once again way too frustrating for your first encounter with said evil..I will keep an eye on it and I recomend you do the same..","July 5, 2015","false","3.6"," 12 of 29 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","12","29","0","0"
