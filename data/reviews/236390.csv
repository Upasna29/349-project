I really want to like this game. Unlike a lot of kiddies who post on the forums, I am much older. I am a gamer from the 80's, growing up on simulators from the 80's and 90's like F-15 Strike Eagle, F-18 Interceptor, Birds of Prey, Their Finest Hour, Knights of the Sky, etc. These were on the Commodore 64, Amiga 500, etc.\n\nIf you are younger and unfamiliar with these titles, look them up. It will show you just how long I have been around flying the cyber skies. I can’t help but be amused when kids try to lecture players who have been flying sims for decades before they were even on the earth. Listen up kidos, you can learn something from your elders.\nWarthunder is very frustrating, it has the potential to be a really good game, but instead is held back by Russian nationalism and left over cold war era mentalities.\n\nI have spent many hours and money on this game, I have supported them financially and really have given them time to fix their problems, unfortunately they continue to run with a delusional narrative.\n\nOften you will hear people claim there is a Russian bias to the game. Well, to be blunt, yes, it true. The only people who argue otherwise always prove to be A) of Russian decent themselves and take it personally, B) Are apologists for Gaijin and tote the typical fan boy nonsense, or C) They use Russian tanks or planes and are comfortable in their over powered vehicles, afraid they will be taken away.\n\nRecently, one of the developers for Gaijin stated that “they cater to the Russian audience because that’s where the money is, they also don’t want to be embarrassed about Russian past or tech”…\n\nSo what does this mean exactly?....Basically he is saying they’re going to fudge the facts for the sake of Russian ego?\nI take issue with Warthunder because Gaijin continues to claim they strive for “historical accuracy” however they have shown no real attempt to make that so.\n\nThey make disparaging comments about German WWII tanks, planes and tech of the era. They claim their hardware was inferior to Soviet hardware, and all the publications that say otherwise is pure “western propaganda”.\nAny objective student of WWII history knows the Germans were known for having very advanced superior equipment. There is a reason Both the U.S. and the Soviets were grabbing up as many German scientist and tech as they could at the end of the war.\n\nThe Planes and Tanks\n\nWarthunder has dishonestly taken Russian planes that were underperforming or produced in low numbers, and exaggerated their abilities. They also have a whole SEPARATE development team for the Russian planes vs the rest of the planes. What does that tell you?\n\nThe P-38 lightning doesn’t perform anything like its real counterpart, I thought, “man, this plane flies like crap”, so I did some research. I found out that Gaijin gave the P-38 a heavy bomber/fighter flight model, they assigned the A-20 flight model to the P-38 lighting! But wait, what did they do with Russian planes that had unfinished flight models? They were simply void of any drag penalties. Instead, they left out variables on the planes, causing them to perform UFO like Arial maneuvers.\n\nThe bombers are all nerfed with bomb load capacity, however without any explanation, the Russian Yer is conveniently left without the same changes, and is allowed a higher capacity.\n\nALL U.S. Navy aircraft are atrocious. They don’t perform near to their real models. The  F-4U Corsair, which was nick named “whispering death” by the Japanese can’t be flown more than two minutes without it beginning to overheat.\n\nThe P-63, which was not a very good plane in general, is given super capabilities. Gee…is that because the Russians used this plane in the war from Lend Lease? Well, what does this tell you? If you look up the P-63 for the Americans, and the P-63 for the Russians, WOW!....the P-63 for the Russians is magically superior in performance despite being an export of the same plane.\n\nThe bombers?....They use to perform ok. Now their destroyed with a massive nurf where a couple of shots from a machine gun will explode a B-29! Its truly ridiculous.\n\nWanting to see for myself, I began to fly Russian planes. Sure enough, the ease in which I could fly around and destroy the enemy with ease was absurd. I shook my head in disgust and quit right there. I later came back and tried again, yet the same thing is happening in tanks as well. You have T-34’s driving around pawning Tigers for crying out loud.\nThere is so much examples of this, we could be here all day. This is only further supported by their absurd forum posts where they talk about Soviet tech being superior to all other nations in WWII. It really is amazing how strong their bias truly is.\n\nThen, Gaijiin behaves like a bunch of KGB thugs. If ANYONE brings up anything deemed slightly critical on their forums, ALL dissent is immediately locked, silenced and deleted. Threads are deleted or locked, and people get banned, simply for holding an opinion they don’t like. Google Gajiin extorion scandal\n\nThat behavior alone truly is disgusting. Here is a real kicker though….look at Gaijiin rules for the games. They state that “historical characters who violated human rights are not permitted to be mentioned”.\n\nHmm…so History they don’t approve of is out, talking about history is out….but here is the best part. Hitler is a no no…can’t talk about him. But wait!......Stalin, a monster who arguably was just as bad if not worse than Hitler, killing 20 million or more of his own people, he is perfectly fine! In fact, Warthunder will even let you put the words “For Stalin” in Russian on the side of your tank or plane! YAY for double standards!\n\nTeam Work?.....foget about it! You have kids flying around ramming, or...while you are working on a plane, they will show no dicipline or respect at all. Rather then hold off your wiing, they will try to fly in front of you while your shooting, and take your kill! Now, 3 things happen here. A} They fly infront of your fire and get hit, then you get penalized for team damge. They also will idiotically accuse you of twam killing. B) they dont get hit by your fire, but cause you to have to break off to avoid a collsion and screw up your kill. Or C) they collide into you, and then accuse you of ramming them.\n\nThere is no mutual respect for team work in this game. It would help if they would implement coms for the whole team, and allow more then 4 players in a squad. Another nice feature would be the ability to fly in the same plane. Firends should be able to get in a bomber together.\nAs of now, IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad seems to be clearly much better.\nIn the end, this is a good game that could be great. It really could be. Unfortunately, it’s undermined by its own developers who have been spoon fed Communist era propaganda to the point of absurdity, who then turns around and can’t help but put it in their own game, only to pull oppressive tact by silencing anyone who dares to point out such nonsense.\nI have been waiting a long time for them to get with the program; unfortunately I am most likely waiting in vain.\nWarthunder has become nothing but a propaganda mill, with Delusional re-writes of history where Red Army planes filled the skies and dominated over the Luftwaffe and all other nations. It’s a joke and insult to call this poor excuse of a “simulator” anything close to being “historically accurate”…only in the world of Commie make believe is this game close to anything historical.\n\nSadly, I’ll probably still play this game, only to be constantly reminded of how great it could be. I have given Gaijin about $100.00 of my money, and sadly I will never get its worth.","August 19, 2015","false","765.1"," 4,594 of 5,215 people (88%) found this review helpful 393 people found this review funny","88","594","5","393","321"

I would have recommended the game 4 years ago when it still had the benefit of the doubt, but now I wouldnt recommend it to anyone.\n\n1.57- This might be a fiarly good patch. Tons of new maps, planes, tanks, EC changes, and increased bomb damage(?). The only thing that I dont like is the complete kills on a tanks crew. It is sometimes difficult or impossible to pen a tanks hull, which means you will not get the kill if the last crew member switches to the drivers seat.\n\n\nI could see the mechanic being usefull for a tank with two crew, but have the guts and brains of your 6 friends splattered all over the tank would prevent me from freely moving around the cabin. It doesnt impact me much though, I only really play in the air war.\n\nEdit- Alright, I think Gaijin finally did it. They have completely killed my desire to play ground forces. Complete kills are almost as worthless as the crew locks and spawn camping. At least I can still fly my planes as long as I take off within 30 seconds...\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore edits- Apperently, they found a way to screw up the high tier BR even more. F80s and Hortons are now matched up with sabers and mig 17s and late war tanks now must fight the best of the cold war tanks. Random sim mode was deleted and the T-34s were given ammo that they never had. I think im done with this game for a while.\n\n\n\nEDIT- I have been playing the game again at a friends request and I have noticed some good changes.\n\n-They seem to have taken notice to us Simulator mode players and are catering to us a little bit more.\n\n-We now have a somewhat polished version of EC mode that looks like it will be sticking around for a while this time.\n\n-For the first time in recorded history, they actually listened to us and kept the normal sim mode in too. It is nowhere as good as the old sim mode, but at least they didnt make it worse this time.\n\n-They fixed the aircraft rendering at long ranges, no more 1km wide planes when viewed at long ranges. Long range spotting was way better at the launch of 1.55, but this is better than how it was a few weeks ago.\n\n\nIts nice that they stick the occasional muffin in the piles of dog ♥♥♥♥ we get for every patch. Its better than nothing, I guess.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nSuch a great idea for a game that is completely ruined by greedy and blind devs. Here are a few reasons why you should stay away from this slime.\n\n\n* Matchmaking was bad, but they just put a bullet in its head in the last patch. Cold war tanks/jets are now able to fight late war planes with matchmaking that completely favors Russia in every way.\n\n* Zero involvement with the community. Normally, listening to the players and adding what they think the game needs will make the game better. These guys dont even care about the players anymore, they hired REALLY bad moderators for the forums and straight up ban people who dont hail them as gods.\n\n* Plenty of broken promises everywhere. We were told we would have bomber internals over 4 years ago and they still have yet to add a single one. We were told we would get better matchmaking over a year ago and still have to see a single shred of that. They said they would give us awesome new damage and flight models, we still fall out of the sky if our wing gets scratched. We were told the game would stop at 1952, but they are adding vehicles from the 70s because Russia always has  to one up everyone else.\n\n* Historical accuracy was thrown out the window. They give Russian planes lower Battleranks so they always play against lower tier planes, this means that 1944 Russian planes fight 1942 and lower German and allied planes. They also like to make Russian planes and tanks WAY more powerful than they actually were\n\n* They keep reducing the armor and power of planes and tanks of the Allied and German forces because they claim that they were just propaganda and they never were that good. At the same time, we are throwing RUSSIAN documents at the devs that show how bad Russian tanks acutally were, and they call it lies and anti Russian propaganda.\n\n* There are plenty of planes that CAN NOT STALL. Most Japanese planes and plenty of Russian planes will not stall, wingtip stall or flatspin in full simulator settings. It is just like flying a spaceship while everyone around you has to obey the laws of physics.\n\n\nDo yourself a favor and stay far away from this pile of ultranationalistic garbage.","September 25, 2015","false","558.8"," 1,492 of 1,744 people (86%) found this review helpful 109 people found this review funny","86","492","1","109","43"

According to (that person), the mods actively check these reviews and downvote any of them that have any kind of criticism. Luckily for us, Steam prevents them from just deleting it like they do on their forums. I believe the top review here is negative, which is good despite my review being positive overall. People need to be aware of all the faults in this game, which are as numerous as all the things this game does right.\n\nIf you decide to download this game just be aware of the unilateral censorship and active deletion and muting of anyone who offers up criticism (constructive or otherwise) on the forum. They do not tolerate it at all and you will have your post removed and will be given a warning point. The forums are helpful, but can be avoided entirely - which is what I recommend. It's not worth the trouble to deal with the mods if you do or say something they deem critical in any way.\n\nAll that said - the game itself is very fun. It's the best plane game on the market right now. Not that that says much, but it's something. The tank mechanics are very poor though, but if you don't mind some occasional RNG wackiness, they are a fun time-killer.\n\nThanks for reading, happy tanking (and piloting).\n\nUpdate: Now that this is on the top of the 30-day review list I anticipate half their mod community coming around here to downvote it. They really are that petty and intolerant of criticism.

To start out with most people will love the game, then as you slowly progress through the tech trees (unless you buy premium which is what they want, don't do it) you start to realise something is a little off. When you are in your Tiger 2 H at 6.7 BR, just minding your own business trying not to be one shot killed by a 122mm shell from an IS-2, then you see it. A little green ♥♥♥♥ driving towards you head on, it's a T-54, yes a tank from AFTER the war fighting WW2 tanks. And well tough luck because you are at his mercy and can't do ♥♥♥♥ to him. Why Gaijin think it's fine to stick post WW2 tanks against WW2 tanks I will never know. You look at this T-54 drivers stats and he has a 90% win rate and a 3.00 K/D ratio. And this isn't just with the T-54 , it's with the majority of Russian tanks. I've noticed a pattern of Russian T5 tanks having 60 and 70% win rates and 2.00 K/D ratios almost always compared to German and American tanks who tend to have 40-50% win rates and just barely over a 1.00 K/D ratio. "There's no Russian bias!" the Gaijin apologist fanboys cry out.... yea ♥♥♥♥ing right.\n\nIf you are like me and you follow what Gaijin are up to with the development of the game, you will see that  they are completely ♥♥♥♥ing inept corrupt snow monkeys looking to get enough Rubels from their playerbase through premium currency so they can buy potatos and vodka and listen to some Russian hard bass while dancing in circles rubbing their hands together like the Jews they are. Every update is them adding a new PREMIUM vehicle that is completely broken and overpowered such as the plethora of tanks they plan to add with rockets on them. And the current rocket tank (the Calliopie) which is ridiculously priced costing £40-50 worth of premium currency and that is completely broken and overpowered. And you know what? No one asked for these, no one.\n\nAnd alas this brings me to my next point. Gaijin do not listen, ever. You ask for more balanced BRs on T5 tanks and they respond by giving some random T2 Russian tank some more bullets for the coaxial machine gun... They just don't give a ♥♥♥♥. If I were to pit Konami and Gaijin off in a contest to see who was the worse company it would be too close to call. Many veterans of this game have left it, many big YouTube channels (such as Jingles, Bismarck, RamJB) have stopped covering it. But yet the ♥♥♥♥s given by Gaijin are still 0. They are slowly suffocating this game to death with their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This used to be a good game, I mean there is no other like it. It's damage model, looks and large variety of vehicles are really un challenged. War Thunder takes a completely different approach to tanks than what World of Tanks does and In my opinion this is the better approach, the realistic damage models and logical spotting system are just so much better (meaning if you look where a tank is it's there and not invisble because of some BS "camo system").\n\nGaijin are like children, in fact I am pretty sure it's run by a bunch of chilldren, they cannot take critiscism, if you try to build a logical complaint about the game it will be dismissed on the forums by the moderators because they too are immature children indoctrinated to see only good in the game and nothing else. If I was to describe the forums I would say they are like a Russian Gulag, you really do get that impression with the much BS and censorship that goes on there. The hoards of loyal fagboys defending every broken aspect of the game regardless of what logic and reason you try to use on them. You would think a veteran player who has been playing the game from the very start would have some form of influenece on Gaijin and what they choose to do to the game? Nope. They are treated even worse than brand new players coming to the game because Gaijin realise they have lost the veteran players to the actual truth and would rather focus on brainwashing more noob players into think this is a "good game".\n\nOverall this game was something unique and still kind of is, I really can't play World of Tanks or any other WW2 flight game as a substitute because War Thunder sits perfectly in between the extreme hardcore flight sims and extremely arcadey flight games. Likewise with the ground combat. But this game is dying, slowly but surely. Not too long ago there were 100,000 players online during a new patch, that number dropped to 60,000 a few days later and has not gone past 60,000 since. Most days it sits around 40-45,000 players. Just goes to show how many people actually see this company for what they actually are, a money grabbing disgrace who have 0 regards for their community.\n\nTLDR - Take it from me, stay away. Gaijin will make you sick to your stomach in disgust with how they treat the community and the game.","September 11, 2015","false","861.3"," 349 of 399 people (87%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","87","349","399","36","2"

Rift support still doesn't work properly. If you want a flightgame for VR look elsewhere.\n\nI'll admit, I'm hooked on this game. But I just can't recommend anyone waste money on this game in the sorry state it is in now. Any player feedback talking about bad things in the game is met with passive aggressive responses from Mods, or just downright hostility. This is just one of the reasons there is no way for player intervention to fix the biggest issues currently with the game. I'm not here to explain the basic concept of the game, just the complete trainwreck this game is becoming. I'll start with my gripes with Simulator, the biggest problem:\n\nThey refuse to admit that its unfair to have third person view available for Bombers, none of the heavy bombers have cockpits at all to speak off, they basically get this virtual cockpit that makes you feel like you're flying a drone than a WWII bomber. They said they would implement bomber cockpits over 2 years ago, they started with the Pe-2/3 series aircraft, with nothing to show for it since then. Bombers in Simulator also get manual gunner control, with the same accuracy and visual awareness they get in Arcade and Simulator, while fighters in those modes also have the same accuracy and visual awareness as bombers, its not an imbalance problem per se. While back in Simulator fighters have no such luxuries, you're confined to a modeled cockpit, with no view besides what the pilot himself would see.\n\nEven today they've admitted that bomber cockpits are a 'long term goal' and that there are more important things to implement, such as more tanks post Korean War. British Tanks, Italian tech tree, More end tier jet aircraft, such as the Vampire, more bombers like the Do-17 series(With no modeled cockpit either mind you) They instead want to implement more vehicles as if that's a more pressing matter than finishing the actual vehicles already in the game. They also have no intention of changing the way bomber gunners work at all, so you'll still have that amazing third person view even with implemented cockpits. The Simulator community used to be a pretty good size when I started playing this game, most people left because they just don't do anything to improve Simulator, player counts keep dropping. They use this as an excuse to not not do anything for Simulator, because the player count is complete rubbish compared to Arcade. Like no wonder man.\n\nTalking about post Korean War stuff. They've had the issue where nobody is playing high tiers 5, the way the game is anything jet powered is in tier 5, regardless of its performance. Anything propeller driven is tier 4 or below, regardless of its performance. For a long time the Me 262, the worlds first introduced Jet fighter 1944, was facing Korean War sabres from the 1950's, it even became its own joke on the net: http://wiki.warthunder.com/images/f/f4/Me_2OP62_-_Back_to_the_Future.jpeg\n\nThe War Thunder Player Council, WTPC, was made up mostly as a PR stunt with voted player representatives, designed for improving communications between Gaijin(the game developer) and the player base. They managed to do a few things, like get the overtiered Me 262 to stop facing the best Korean War vehicles out there such as the Sabre and the Mig-15bis. But everything they've done is pretty much moot following Gaijin's "Quantatitive Restrictions" matchmaker just in the last week, the intention being that if you have a team of weak planes, against the other team of weak planes, with 4 or so really really advanced planes on each team, that they'll end up getting all the kills and the rest are dead meat. They've basically destroyed everything the WTPC had done to fix the 'end game' as they call it.\n\nThe complaints from players has always been that there was overcompression with the high tiers. But instead they just overcompress it even more, so everything from the Korean war and post is now facing WWII Jets and props. The performance devide is so big you can't get it anywhere else in the game. They've done the same with tanks too so you have what was arguably the best tank in the game, the T-10M, a Cold War tank from the Russians, facing German WWII tanks from 1944. This was all done to lower the queue times, they thought it was such an problem that people only queued in the T-10M and IS-4M, so they decide to bring the lower tiers into their games. It should have been obvious from the get go that everyone spam queued the IS-4M before they introduced the T-10M, introducing that tank was such a huge mistake. When no other nation has anything close to it.\n\nThat isn't even the best part, they've even given tanks such as the tier 4; IS-2 1944, ammunition that was developed years later, the BR-412D, only ever used on the IS-3 and IS-4M, but they give the IS-2 it in the name of "balance", its got a similar penetration as the APCR shell the Germans in the same tiers get, APCR has no explosive filler, but this shell the Russians got has even more explosive filler than the normal shells the Germans get. Insane.\n\nAll this has brown up on the forums, months ago any discussion on the "ABuse" of bombers in Simulator was met with a swift warning from a specific Senior Moderator and the threads locked. Guy thought he was 'helping' us by silencing our arguments, as if they didn't exist. As if enemy bombers landing on your airfieild and killing you on spawn with no way to stop it, over and over, is not abusive in any way at all. Here are youtube videos of exactly what I'm talking about: Unconventional AAA,\nNo such thing as ABuse,\nSpawn Camping,\nall this is 100% okay according to them.\n\nThe term "ABuse" and "ABuser" originates from how easy it is to do good with bombers in Simulator, where you openly have people admit on the forums and elsewhere on the internet, those that mostly play Arcade, "Arcade Battles user" play bombers in simulator only because its easier than in Arcade or Realistic, in order to be able to grind jets faster, and only because its easier, its much harder for fighters to take down bombers in Sim than it is in Realistic, where bad bomber pilots would be toast, while in sim even the worst pilot ever, as long as he can keep the plane in the air, can be the best player on the team.\n\nFor as long as you have such incompetent 12 year olds moderating their forums who can't even punctuate properly in any form. There will be no way to even get this message across to the developers because those 12 year old moderators will outright prevent your message from reaching them. But its not just them, even the top guys doing the decisions for the game have no clue what's going on, its as if nobody at Gaijin even plays Simulator at all, or the game in general when it comes to how they're handling tier 5 stuff.\n\nI will only stick with this game for now because I'm a co-leader of a squadron in-game, and I'm not going to abandon them because the game is falling apart.\n\nEDIT: The game still advertises its self as being an MMO, its the same 32 player limit you see in TF2. is TF2 an MMO? No? Then War Thunder isn't either.\n\nUpdate March/April 2016: Most prominent moderator I mentioned is still a Senior Moderator. But hasn't shown his/her face in the Simulator Battles Discussion part of the forum in a long time. WTPC is non existent. They just introduced the P-61 heavy fighter, without a cockpit. Its currently the most devastating aircraft to face in Simulator. Now you get 'captured' when you land on enemy airfields. Simulator is still treated like it's just DLC.\n\nThe following video explains more because I'm reaching the character limit for reviews: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=latDD3xmQMM","September 27, 2015","false","865.9"," 430 of 511 people (84%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","84","430","511","24","14"

I hardly have any complaints about the game itself, which makes it a shame that I can no longer even stand it.\n\nThe moderators of this game are the WORST I've ever encountered ANYWHERE, and that's against every website, forum, or game I've had an account on since the age of Dial-Up. The false sense of superiority and lack of basic respect that these Mods exhibit is as angering as the amount of hours I've sunk into a game that I am no longer able to play. I am still in disbelief that EVERY moderator has blown me off, with the exception of the one that replied just so he could call me a Nazi. His empty accusation isn't just offensive, but it's pathetic. I am not a Nazi and I never represented myself to be in any fashion, the mod simply formed an opinion based on my German username and refuses to believe anything different. I have been nothing but pleasant to every moderator, even offering an explanation and a solution to the man who insulted me. Unfortunately, I have received nothing but disrespect in return from the people who are refusing to reinstate my account.\n\nThe bottom line is that Gaijin needs to increase their standards of who they accept as moderators before they lose even more players.

Don't get me wrong I've had fun in this game in the past playing with friends and so on. But I have now reached the higher tiers of this game and I can tell you one thing. IT IS NOT WORTH IT. The devs went full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and they will end up destroying what could've been an awesome game. I have 3 huge problems with the devs of this game and I will outline them below:\n\n1 - LACK OF BALANCE: Yes I like realism in games but to a certain extent.. games need to be fun.. and to be fun they need to be balanced. If you love playing with russian tanks and airplanes you will have a great time playing this game. If you prefer German or American and british units go ahead and buy yourself a lot of lube because they will sodomize THE LIVING S!"# OUT OF YOU.\n\n2 - RIDICULOUS MATCHMAKING: "IN SOVIET RUSSIA YOU DO NOT CHOOSE MATCH... MATCH CHOOSES YOU" that's right folks the matchmaking on this game is ridiculous. You can not choose which map you wanna play in. You don't even get to choose which theater of war you play in so if you take for example the TBF-AVENGER medium bomber used in the pacific 95% of the time matchmaking takes you to the battle of the bulge. And that's after you select REALISTIC battles on the matchmaking. And that's when you're lucky and they don't put you on a REALISTIC MIXED Battle against overpowered russians.\n\n3- BOMBERS: I've had a lot of fun with bombing missions in the lower tiers. So once I got around tier 3 with the brits I decided I wanted to unlock one of my fav bombers. The lancaster. So after like 700 hours of playing this game without putting money into it I decided it was maybe time to spend some money and save some time so I spent about 30 euros on golden eagles and insta-unlocked the Lancaster. What I can tell you now is that next time I'll just go outside and hand the 30 euros to someone and tell them to spit in my face and laugh out loud and call me stupid in russian because this is what Gaijin did to me. The lancaster (and any other high-tier bomber for that matter) is a great choice if you like to pleasure men. Thats what I've done on any mission I've flown with these bombers.. You spend like 10 minutes flying to a bomb target only to get intercepted by a jet fighter with enough armament that it prematurely ejaculates 1000 pounds of lead on you before your gunners even smell him cumming.\n\n13/10 "If you didn't hate russians before playing this game you will now ;)"","October 9, 2015","false","798.4"," 512 of 625 people (82%) found this review helpful 186 people found this review funny","82","512","625","186","30"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDancingWalrus/recommended/236390/","TheDancingWalrus","The Dancing Walrus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDancingWalrus/","60 products in account","I bet you're wondering what a person who has this much time spent playing the game is doing by not recommending it.  Well, in short, it goes a little like this:\n\nPre-patch 1.37, the game was making incremental, but still positive steps forward.  In general, the game's biggest downfall back then was simply lack of proper flight models for a lot of the aircraft.  The economy woes from patch 1.29 had mostly been completely fixed by 1.33-1.35, and the game was just a pleasure to play and I couldn't get enough of it.  I even decided to devote my semi-successful YouTube channel completely to War Thunder.  A mistake that I'm now regretting.\n\nAfter patch 1.37, the game simply went to ♥♥♥♥.  While the game's flight models are now in probably their best state yet (but still not even anywhere close to perfect), nearly every other aspect of the game is has gotten 10 times worse.  The issues that I have with the game in its current state can be a bit hard to count, but I'll give it a try:\n\n\nNon-existant in-game economy\n\nNearly impossible grind (mostly the top two tiers, 4 and 5) for both unlocking aircraft/tanks and the aircraft/tank modules.  Forget progressing at any decent pace without a premium account, and even with a premium account, tier 5 vehicles are near impossible to upgrade without dumping money into the game.  This "grindy" element adds a pay to win mechanic.\n\nHorribly F'd up matchmaker system that is based solely upon player statistics.  For a game that prides itself on historical accuracy and authenticity, it's a bit odd to me that it doesn't even take history into account when creating matchups for the vehicles.  This in addition to the fact that Gaijin's system also does a horrible job at creating balanced matchups, so we now have a game that's  neither historical, nor is it balanced .\n\nA completely broken and unfinished ground forces.  It wasn't ready to be released in open beta, and none of the closed beta testers were pushing for a release.  Yet they did it anyway, and now we have this broken bug-fest filled with wonky damage models, invisible tanks, tiny maps, and useless terrain.\n\nThe horrible damage models is not unique to the tanks.  War Thunder now has heavy bombers flying around and taking damage as if they were the Starship Enterprise.  Not to mention the flight models of these bombers also resemble the Enterprise as well.\n\nThe development team is prioritizing prototype and failure aircraft over some of the real iconic workhorse aircraft of WW2.  In addition to this, development has now made it clear that they have plans to add certain paper planes (aka blueprint planes - Stuff that was never even built).\n\nA development team that often lies to their customer base and doesn't take constructive critisism from those customers seriously.  They have a very "The customer is always wrong" kind of attitude, one could say.\n\nThe community management team in general does a bad job of running the forums.  A lot of them are truly passionate about the game and what they do, but they don't understand the roles of a moderator/administrator.  Then again, a lot of them are just immature children (some of them literally are children) that will delete your post, put you on a mod queue, or ban you simply because they feel like it.\n\n\nAlright, I know those last two weren't necessesarily complaints about the actual game, but I still feel like they needed mentioning.  The consumer has to know what they're getting into before downloading a game and cetainly before spending money on that game.  That being said, I've finally thrown in the towel with this game.  I can't recommend playing it in its current state, and I would definitly advise against spending any money on it.\n\nPeople come for the pretty graphics, but they stay for good gameplay.\nAs of now, War Thunder only has one of those two.  I wish Gaijin luck in the long run, as they'll truly need it.\n\nThanks for reading.","July 21, 2014","false","397.1"," 901 of 1,128 people (80%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","80","901","1","9","15"

I'm barely kidding when I say this thing could probably run on a toaster.\n\nThis game has a huge variety of aircraft from all of the major players of ww2.\n\nFor the most part, airplane flight models are accurate and well balanced based on real life statistics.\n\nThere is a gamemode for everyone, want to play a highly realistic flight simulator mimicking real life? Simulator batles for you. Want an easier time but still a challenge, realistic flight models and mouse aim? Historical/realistic (the name changed). Just want to spam the cannons and mess around while pulling top gun maneuvers with flight models being only suggestions? Arcade has you covered.\n\nThere is a decent variety of maps, varying across the world.\n\nWant to drive tanks and other vehicles? Go ahead and play ground forces.\n\nBeautifully detailed aircraft exteriors and interiors.\n\nBut wait, with all of this great stuff, mostly gameplay and mechanics, why don't you recommend this?\nAnd here we get to the bad;\n\nGaijin is very slow to implement updates to their game, and have consistently ignored player feedback/ suggestionz to make the game better, for absolutely no reason.\n\nGaijin has consistently made game decisions with the intent of making money, to the detriment of players by;\n\nCreating a system that limits progression by forcing players to purchase six aircraft in each of the five tiers in order to      progress on to the next tier.\n\nAdding a research system as well as the purchasing system to force players to spend more time unlocking aircraft.\n\nReducing the money and research points earned for each kill and assist in game.\n\nCreate an upgrade system for each aircraft requiring you to spend time researching parts for your aircraft just to get it up to the stat characteristics it historically had\n\nGaijin have locked country flags behind a paywall to "prevent insults by disrespecting flags". However these flags are easily purchasable for real money.\nFor all of these there is a way to speed up the progression by spending real money. Gaijin have slowed down   progression to such a degree that you are almost forced to pay real money in order to progress in a decent fashion.\n\nThere is much that needs to be improved, for instance better flight models, a vast improvement to the leveling system and tiering system. Cockpit view for bombers and other heavy aircraft. What is not needed, and what is contantly added, is more premium (and expensive) aircraft.\n\n, for the past couple of years during sales gaijin will raise the base price of a game and then discount it to such a degree that the final price will be the original price before the sale. This is a shady and unethical buisness practice.\n\nThe endgame for war thunder (jet aircraft) is lackluster and unfinished, providing no motivation to stay once money has been given to gaijin.\n\nFinally, the tiering system, by which players are matched up against each other, is horribly inefficient and compressed, meaning players will be competing against far superior planes, and altogether making it unenjoyable for beginners.\n\nFor these reasons, I cannot recommend war thunder to players for purchase. If you can play this game without paying any money, then by all means go ahead, but it has become harder and harder to justify paying for this game.\n\nThis game has so much promise, and I desperately hope that all of these problems can be solved, however on the current path, it cannot reach it's full potential.\n\n\n","June 11, 2015","false","279.3"," 219 of 257 people (85%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","85","219","257","7","5"

The real issue is how ♥♥♥♥ed the battle rating system Gaijin implemented is. You may not notice it at first... but eventually it will drive you crazy. Because it will never be fixed, never. This is the second problem, the developer is actively hostile to player feedback. On the forums people's posts concerning negative aspects of the game are deleted by the moderating staff with no reason given. It's just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ company... The payment model, while fair, is horrendously overpriced, and never on sale. The grind for this game is absolutely insane. It takes soooo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long to grind out anything past tier 3 in aircraft that you will quickly grow sick of it. (Edit: By the way trolls, I'm saying this because I'm grinding out tier 5, not because I haven't gotten to tier 3... morons.)\n\nI wish I could reccomend this game, because at its core warthunder is one of the best flight sims out there (and when the match maker isn't being ♥♥♥♥, games can be incredibly fun) but for the reasons stated above, I simply cannot. There are developers that treat their customers with a million times the respect that gaijin shows for its playerbase. Games like Warframe really show how absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gaijin is about rewarding their playerbase and how bad their free to play model actually is.\n\nSave you time, save your money, play something else. Go outside, work out, you will feel a million times better about yourself than if you waste your time on this.\n\nEdit 1: To the commenters that say "KEKEKEK Yall just suck at this game, git gud" You will be deleted. That is not a valid criticism, and even if it were true it doesn't make any negative critique of the game invalid. I have seen frankly amazing players making the same criticisms of this game. I've been playing this game for years and have finally gotten fed up, if you are still enjoying the game I have no intention of taking that from you, I am only warning you that the things that annoy you about the game now are likely to be there for quite some time.\n\nEdit 2: I have had some time to cool down away from the game, and have even tried getting back into it for the 1.51 update. While I can say that I still have fun in this game from time to time I still cannot really reccomend it. Not yet anyway. They made some neat additions and added some cool planes, but really it's still the massive, frustrating time sink I remember. If you've only just started this game you can be forgiven for thinking that it's awesome. It is!... Until you try to be serious about progressing, then it turns from fun into literally pulling your hair out. I would reccomend trying this game, and then maybe playing for an hour or two every week but no more than that... It's hard to find a game to get your WWII flight sim fix these days, especially for free. So unfortunately it doesn't really have much in the way of competition. Once again, I wish I could reccomend this game but my opinion hasn't changed, spend your time and money on a game/developer that respects its players.","April 25, 2015","false","527.1"," 582 of 744 people (78%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","78","582","744","41","31"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kiju/recommended/236390/","Kiju","Kiju","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kiju/","210 products in account","So, I just feel like this needs to go on record, and to actually say something about it. Now... I like WarThunder. It's probably one of the best online, WWII multiplayer flight-sims out there. American, Russian, British, German, and Japanese aircraft all make an appearance, so you can fly anything from the P-51 Mustang, to a Bf-109, and feel like you're actually in the cockpit. Heck, they've even recently added in tank combat, and are even going to be adding in naval warfare in the near future! That said, this game has gone completely down the toilets within the past several months.\n\nLemme explain a bit of the history of the game. Awhile ago, there were ten tiers, and you used to have a level with all of the different factions (American, Russian, British, etcetera), that determined what aircraft you could buy, due to their tier. Lets say you managed to get up to tier 4 in American aircraft, right? Well, that means you could buy any aircraft that's from tier one, to tier four, but if you're only tier 2 in Germany, you can only buy up to tier 2 German aircraft. Get the idea? Right, good. Recently, they completely revamped their level up and tier system, making it so there are only five tiers (which condenses it by quite a bit), but instead of unlocking the next tier of aircraft, you could only unlock one aircraft at a time. This isn't really a bad idea... but the problem is, this also nearly quadrupled the amount of time it will take to unlock every aircraft of a certain faction. What's worse, is they lowered (by a *lot*) the amount of experience you earn per assist or kill, forcing you to slow down your leveling even further, and enhancing the amount of free exp you get per match, which just entices you to buy their premium currency so you can use said free experience. It has turned this game into a slog of a grind that makes progression rediculously slow and boring.\n\nThe method of experience is by far one of my biggest gripes, I'll admit. It's a sickeningly underhanded method of encouraging players to spend money on the game, to buy the premium currency so you can spend your free experience. I don't usually mind "pay to progress" games, they're usually not too terrible, but this one is rediculous. It makes World of Tanks' progression seem like a breeze.\n\nOn to the next hit against this game: balancing. With the aforementioned condensing of the tier system into only five tiers, Gaijin thought it would be clever to introduce a Battle Rating system, to compensate, and to avoid having biplanes going up against end-of-war aircraft. This isn't really so bad, and it probably could have even been a good idea, had they implemented it correctly. You'd expect the Battle Rating system to be based off of the aircraft (or tank's) stats, and understanding that something like say... a P-40 Kittyhawk, or an F6F Hellcat would be a fair match against an A6M3 Zero, as they fought against one another in the actual war. Right? Well... that's a nice thought, but it's not how it works. See, their battle rating system is based entirely on the performance of the aircraft in player hands. The better someone does with an aircraft, the higher its battle rating within its own tier. This is inherently flawed; while someone might do well in an aircraft, that does not necessarily mean that it is able to go against something better than it, and still win. An A6M3 Zero can see fights against aircraft that were built several *years* after their initial development, because their battle ratings are similar. This is horribly wrong, and does not do anything to make a game fun, or balanced.\n\nAnd, on to the last topic of my complaints. This is actually a rather common one amongst most of the player base, and - while I'm normally not one to base something on unfounded theories and accusations, you'd think that since the majority of WarThunder's player base seems to agree on this fact, it must be true to some degree.\n\nRussian aircraft, and tanks, are given unfair advantages, and handicaps. Bet you thought I was going to say overpowered, huh? Well... I won't, because most of their aircraft did function to the specs given in WarThunder. However. This does not mean that their questionable damage models, unrealistic flight models and characteristics, and their absolutely rediculously favoritism'd battle ratings, are fair. To elaborate: Russian aircraft have damage models that seem to soak up a lot of damage without the plane actually registering said hits (players coin this term as the aircraft being made of "Stalinium"). Russian aircraft also have very... generous climb and turn rates, and this weird ability to dive faster, accelerate faster, and keep their momentum longer, than almost every aircraft, even those that were historically faster and better in a dive, a turn, or a climb (An Ishak monoplane from 1934 diving faster than an F4U Corsair, for example). And lastly, they seem to have this... preferential treatment when it comes to their battle rating (LA-5Fn having a battle rating of 4.0 even though it's a 1944 aircraft, whereas the P-51D-30 Mustang has a battle rating of 4.7, with worse stats, armament, and durability).\n\nDespite all these bad things I said, WarThunder is still fun every now and then. Personally, I think it would be even better if they fixed all of the balancing issues and horribly slooooow progression they have going. It's gone from an interesting and exciting game, to a boring, slogfest of a grind that just isn't fun anymore. But who knows, maybe it's just me? Give it a try for yourself. Its worth the download. Just don't be surprised if it takes you several *weeks* to get out of the starting planes and/or tanks.","January 10, 2015","false","384.7"," 1,145 of 1,512 people (76%) found this review helpful 77 people found this review funny","76","145","1","77","44"

As much as it pains me to say that, in the current state the game is absolutely broken, especially german tanks and planes. The german planes are broken, and the german tanks are underpowered and completely outmatched by their american and russian counterparts, and the recent update to the BR system means that uptiered rank III and IV tanks get to fight russian T-10M's and IS-4's with 120mm of armor on all sides and literally unpennable from the front. all while the starting german tier V tanks arent even that good, starting tanks on that tier are the 10.5cm Tiger II (a Tiger II (H) with a slightly bigger gun), Panther II (Panther F with a slightly bigger gun), Coelion (SPAA so useless against most tanks anyways) and the Jagdtiger (Tiger II without a rotating turret and a bigger gun) which are literally no different from their tier IV counterparts besides the armament, meaning that you can be detonated with the force of a thousand suns from any direction, while you cant pen anything from the front unless its a light tank. The planes are also unbearable because of how slow the german planes turn, it takes close to 25 seconds to make a full 360 degree turn in the fockewolf, while the BF is better its still slow, you simply cant keep up with the meanuverability of other planes and as a result you are always killed. Russian planes are overpowered, shooting gigantic rounds that detonate your plane instantaniously if it hits your plane.

As soon as you play for a longer time you will see the massive racism of the developers and sheer cheek of their pay2win greed.\n\n+The game is pretty\nThis is it.. it looks good and runs well. The only + in this review.\n\n-Russian bias\nIt's real, its totally real. Russian planes outright outperform lots of other planes and russian tanks downright deflect shells with magic armor. No surprise the developers are russian. Their response to the bias is that they have "Secret documents" about WW2, probably saying Russia had magic infused armor made from Stalin's bumsweat and nosehair.\nTime and time again the community has provided declassified documents themselves, disproving the armor effectiveness and certain nerfs on especially germans, from MANY countries, even CCCP but devs/mods just ignore it/delete it.\nI would also like to add that Steam moderators have CONFIRMED that russian bias exists about a month ago from writing this review.\n\n-Pay2Win\nCertain vehicles are behind a paywall going up to 60 euro a vehicle sometimes. These are blatantly better than their free counterparts on the same rating. Special armor, non-exploding fueltanks, the list goes on.\nBut most irritating are the rocketlaunching tanks. The Callioppe for instance has 60 rockets mounted ontop of a Sherman, each rocket is DEVASTATING for other tanks downright riddling the crew with shrapnel. Add to that a insanely high RoF and a 10 second reload speed. Also the rockets cannot be taken out by shooting the canisters. No surprise its a 50 euro tank.\n\n-Map Design\nPartially to blame for the russian bias is the map design. Most maps are made specifically for close range brawler tanks ( russian ) and aircombat always at a low enough altitude to "justify" the russian superiority as russian planes were best at low altitudes ( below 5 km ).\nSpawn camping is easily done as you only need to do a small drive of about 30 seconds on certain maps to be in enemy spawn. You have a brief spawnprotection but thats void as soon as you're alive for a few seconds. You drive out of spawn then and boom, someone shot you in your side who was hiding in a bush/behind a rock next to your spawn.\n\n-Battle Rating\nThe most agrivating and full on bias thing to exist in War Thunder.\nVehicles are classed by a Battle Rating ( BR ) as to balance the matches so a lategame heavy tanks wont face 1920's tanks.\nThis is broken, there is no way around it.\nRussian vehicles have favorable BR's to their opponents. Purposely classed lower than what theyre actually worth so they decimate other countries. ( Also outperforming specialised turnfighters with a flying russian brick and magic armor )\nHow it is supposed to work is your highest vehicle will be chosen and put into a match with +/-1 BR or 1.3 in planes. Seeing as i fight BR 3.3 tanks in my 1.3 tanks, I cannot kill anything.\n\n-Developers\nAs said earlier they are racist towards anything what isn't russian. Disregarding anyone not speaking russian as less important. Deleting and banning alot of feedback on their own forum and having Steammods delete any negative feedback. Steammods also actively downvote negative reviews reportedly.\nAlso I think Gaijin spies on what you say via bots as I myself have been banned from chat while ONLY talking in Squadchat with my friends, badmouthing Gaijin. 15 day chatban for hate messages. Only hate against Gaijin though.\nGiving russian vehicles magic abilities, nerfing all other countries to oblivion (mostly germans), banning and deleting community for feedback and having a MASSIVE P2W mentality with 50 euro blatantly overpowered vehicles.\n\nEdit: Gaijin forced a youtuber to delete a video he made with footage showing a hacker. They do not want the world to see they cannot handle hackers.\n\nShame Gaijin, shame. We complain to you because we want to see a good WW2 game but all you do is hide behind your nationalism and hate on us.\n\nAlso alot of members of the community are toxic.","May 21","false","260.3"," 335 of 421 people (80%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","80","335","421","51","98"

Tanks look bad ♥♥♥. The noise of the tracks, the sound of the engine, the force of the gun. The dirt that would pile on the tank when shots landed nearby. It was awesome.\n2) No health points. Your tank died once the crewmen inside it died. Either through the tank getting shot and shrapnel spraying inside the tank, or a fire/explosion caused by your ammo/fuel taking a hit.\n3) Disabling tanks depending on where you shot them. Depending on where you hit/or get hit, different things would happen. If the driver or engine is hit the tank can't move. If the gunner is hit the tank can't shoot. If the loader is hit the tank can't load another round. If the turret is hit you can't shoot or move it.\n4)Driving around in what seemed like realistic tanks. The terrain you're driving around also looks amazing. Great graphics.\n\nWhat made me uninstall:\nRealising how horribly unbalnced the game really is and that it's never getting better. Only worse with every patch that comes out. Russian bias. Developer is a Russian company and they provide unhistorical advantages to russian vehicles.\n\n1.Russian ammo is coded to cause more fires than american/german ammo.\n2.Russian ammo is coded to have more explosions than american/german ammo.\n3.Russian tanks are coded to have a less chance to explode/catch on fire than american/german tanks.\n4.Russian tanks are coded to bounce more shells.\n5.Other tanks will wobble and screw your aim when moving or coming to a hard stop. Not russian tanks.\n6.I saw a friend go from 3-4 average tanks destroyed per match to 8-10 when he switched to Russian tanks.\n\nAll of this I ignored. The cards are stacked against you if not playing Russian tanks, but It was possible to make up for it with skill, tactics, and picking the right tanks to fight them. The last few patches just proved they won't stop stacking the cards. The highest tier is unbalanced and avoided due to Russian OP tanks. Instead of fixing the problem, they patched the game and changed the matchmaking to force players from the second highest tier to fight against them. WW2 tanks forced to fight post WW2 cold war tanks. Russian WW2 tanks allowed access to post WW2 cold war ammo.\n\nAnd now with the latest patch they introduced a new spotting/cammo system which makes a tank practically invisible unless you spend money to buy points to spot them. Every tank has a rating that determines their chance to be spotted.  Guess who it favors more? Russian tanks have a 40% advantage compared to American/German tanks. And if that wasn't enough, they wen't and nerfed the distance at which you could aim for everyone. The way I survived and did well vs the Russian Bias was to snipe them from long distances. Now they took that away. Well that's it. I'm done with this.\n\nOne of the most stupidly unbalanced/unfair games I have ever played. This game will never have a competitive scene and it's player base is declining. Don't waste your time on it.","November 5, 2015","false","186.6"," 394 of 502 people (78%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","78","394","502","23","16"

It took them a year to mess up and for us to have our first brush with disaster.\n\nAfter ignoring the many, and I repeat.... MANY complaints/reviews.... stating WarThunder has no respect, no effort, blown off, lack of responses without reading the initial complaint, ect ect...\n\nLest... we abstained and still gave them a year of my money and time.\nLike always the Review Crew spends our time getting to the truth, being fair to both sides of the coin. but now... the dragon rears its ugly head.... and we had our first problem in nearly a year (171 hours)... and you will be entertained more with our writings that follow, than the game or customer service. In short, we are completly done with this company and anyone affiliated with it!!\n\nWe begin our review...  as we now... ENTIRELY agree with all complaints! After giving them (WarThunder) three (3) months.... to fix a legit, screen shot proven, paper trailing, document provided.... complaint/request for assistance!\nCould of not had this any more obvious or proven if written in blood on a wall, with the killer standing there with a gun and a sign around his neck saying he did it!\n\nNo excuse for reundant, pathetic abuse of people, with proven and legit reasonable request(s).\nThen to degrade us when they(WarThunder) were out of options! We thought ok... its time to give back to us for being so helpful and devoted in providing everything and anything requested (even if it had nothing to do with the request) we provided it.\n\nFor months we tried to help WarThunder to help us, patient, super nice people that just got screwed worse than a hooker at a five and dime. Could not believe the HUGE loads (check my hands) of money we have spent, and sadly... and then the comprehensible (HOLY F*ck we what a word!)\n\nBack to the story... while away for a week with my son being born (truly freaking exciting past the point of pee!!! ), we returned as many do after many missed updates (9 to be exact in 2 weeks)\nWe return to find all our money(gold and coin) items(planes and tanks) gone, along with all experience and funds.. just a blank account.\n\nNow to be fair, there was a post saying some updates had data dumps ect... just send us a screenshot and proof and we will do this and that.... ok... so we did.\n\nAccount not compromised, black and white proof of purchases, no acitivity on my end and they did nothing! Did not even bother to read the complaint, responded with requesting this and that and then redundantly doing it over and over.. with nothing to resolve in the complaint. So what was a legit complaint now has 8 more things piled on... but now they expected us to go away... so we asked and pleaded. Stated we had proof and sent it more times over than you see boobies on TV!\n\nWe received a reply that was... for the lack of a better word(s)... MOTHER EXPLATIVE EXPLATIVE... after ALL THE pateince AND respect, fulfilling request after request, for over a 3 months while unable to play!! (Listen people, you can dress a turd and call it chocolate, but its still SH*T!)\n\nIt was their (WarExplative) turn to do for us! Three months enough, I believe it is reasonable not to ask any more repititious questions and cater to them.\nWe said "there is nothing more we can send you that we havent already."\nA week later we were returned to an email bearing the surreal....\n"we dont care if you leave, your a bumb ♥♥♥ american and we have a million users that spend money, goodbye dumb American." from SERGI. So now we research and got attorneys looking into things because of the email. They reached dead end after dead end with the same name coming up as the sole person responsible located in Russia.\n\nExplative, few more dirty words and gestures, and then sad face...!\n\nThere is no need for that!\nUnprovoked... bah.... oh I hope Mr. Karma checks this many times over and pays SERGI and the team behind him dearly.\n\nWe wont even focus much on the statement of ignorance, even if anyone does not like us for being from the USA, but hey, spread more racism and hate! Who's stopping you SERGI right? You sure like our/anyones hard earned  money tho.\n\nIt proved what we read from others and didnt believe for over a year, being fair like we always are.\nAlways two sides to the coin... but in this case and thousands of others, the complaints just keep mounting and are legit.\nSo we call all the numbers we could find to discover one person... SERGEI... (Stupid Mother F*cker for short) handles all their USA complaints as the big man.\n\nOk so nothing I can do, or say, but sorry I was born in a country you dont like. (Here's a gun, use it as a toothpick you racist pig.)\n\nIn Closing;\n\nYou would think on the business side... here is a great repeat customer, legit to our requests, patient, and proved they had all securities in place, proven NO activity on the account from anyplace on the globe, and provided what we had and spent over the past year from their (WTF) own records... so lets give these items back to him and figure out where they went... but NO... not one reply had anything to do with our request. But because he from the USA... wow... just no words.\n\nWhile they have the "loose one wont break the company" mentality, those who supported their game and company for a year and still giving them a chance... with one complaint with legit backing and proof provided... and what did we get... A HUGE D*C* in the AS* with a side order of HUGE (Plenty of follow thru) SLAP then BEATING in our face! So after this for just a polite simple request that even had humor in it, and a proven complaint with legit screenshots and purchase information, there is nothing they can do or say to justifiy it as training as more than one CS agent in all our tickets repeated the same thing.\n\nNo excuse for reundant, pathetic abuse of people with proven legitimate complaints that were poilite, respectful and gave them everything and then some to their requests.  Sad it took us a year for our first problem to discover such terrible abuse! Dont find out what we did, it may not happen in a month or a year but if you have anything you need for your account, simple or extensive... good luck.. go talk into a fan and have someone pour acid thru the other side... it would at least give back!\n(ok.... dont really do it, no one should hurt themselves over these terrible people who f*ck people over daily man or woman)\n\nWorld of Tanks or World of War Planes or World of Warships is where your money is appreciated and respected we have also supported for years as well... at least they are fair, read the complaints, share and compare facts and still even if you are found to be somewhat incorrect or interpret something incorrect, they take care of you, no issue, no hassle in my two prior problems in six years.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscalimer; The Review Crew's evaluations are based on paying close attention to forum response and activity, system demand, fun of the game genre, position of originality in respective genre, growth of the project in its current state at time of review, graphics as a whole for end user, presentation of the game and display, replayability, patch/tweak progress, beginner friendliness & gameplay direction, content & depth, attention to detail on small things(polish), lag and multiplayer application if applicable, badge card availability, with a minimum 8 hours of gameplay and interaction with customer base after release.

But thats not my point really.\nI have probably put 2 thousand hours and several hundred dollars into this game, and if you had asked me a year or 2 ago if I recommneded it, I wouldve said yes, all the way. But now, the game is a broken mess that infuriates me more than it entertains me.\nWhere do I even begin?\nCountry bias is strong, being a Russian game, the Russian planes are incredibly overpowered, and dont even think about getting within a kilometer of a Russian tank.\nThe customer support base is terrible. Instead of rolling out tweaks and fixes that players have been asking for for over a year, they simply add more planes to the Russian tree and maybe a few to the others and further mess up the system that is so badly in need of balancing.\nTo do anything above tier 3 in anything short of a human life time you will need to pay for a premium account, and even then, you better play realistic battles (which in my opinion are not nearly as fun as Arcade), AND EVEN THEN you better have paid $20+ for a Premium Aircraft.\nNo, this game has just become too much of a "Pay to Win" cash cow for Gaijin, rather than focusing on making it a fun experience for everyone, no matter what country or game type someone wants to play.\nI think the best line I've seen that descibes this game now is,\n"Grind 'till you die...\nor pay up."\n\n*EDIT*\n\nThis may be a petty gripe, but I think it sums up how little the developers care about their user base.  Most online games give stuff away for the Holiday season, right?  Gaijin begs to differ. You can earn 2 very low tier vehicles.... if you complete 19 challanges that are released over 19 days. NINETEEN. And they are shoot down 30 planes in "inset plane here" and destroy 40 tanks in "insert tank here."\nNot only are the rewards crap, the amount of work required and amount of time you have to grind is insane. No discounts on the overpriced planes, overpriced premium accounts, or overpriced premium currency have been offered either.\nSo Gaijin's "Merry Christmas" to their user base is basically a giant, grindy middle finger. A rather apt comparison to what the entire game has become over the last year.\n\n*EDIT 10/12/2015*\n\nNew Matchmaking system put into tier 4.\nSomehow, SOMEHOW, they have found an even more unbalanced and infuriating system.\nOn paper it sounds great, having teams put together so that they have an entire BR covrage, with a few higher BR people, middle of the rodd BR people, and lower BR people all on one team, instead of an entire team of Tigers.\nTheoretically it should be great, but in game it is the worst thing to happen since the implementation of the Battle Rating system.\nI played a total of 9 games as a 6.7 on US and USSR, and in every single game I was going up against 8.0s, and would get one shotted.\nWhat this new system means, in basic terms, is that it is garunteed that every game there will be a handful of players who will completely dominate because they have a BR advantage over almost every single other person in the game.\nAnd while that person might be you one game, I played 9 games and was always, always, ALWAYS, at the bottom of the BR list.\nIt is terrible, no other word for it, completely and utterly terrible.\nI have an idea, how about games where there is 0 - 0.5 BR spread, instead of 1 BR spread, because the 1 BR spread now is completely unfair (more so than it was before, even).\nAnd of course, 90% of people in game are complaining about it, no one likes it, but the forums have an absence of this overwhelming opinion.\nWhy? Because Gaijin is cracking down harder than ever and deleteing, locking, and banning players and posts that show any kind of displeasure with any new game additions.\nWhen Britt tanks are released I might try again.\n\n*EDIT 4/11/16\n\nSo I'm still not giving War Thunder a Recommendation. Why?\nBecause it is Crack.\nI hate it, and I hate what it does to me and my bank account, but I can't stop playing it, even if I play it far less than I used to I still play it several times a week.\nBut under no circumstances would I recommend it to a friend, still.\nThere have been some improvements, but not nearly enough to return it to its former glory.\nSave yourselves, don't get sucked in.","October 20, 2014","false","457.4"," 1,237 of 1,684 people (73%) found this review helpful 103 people found this review funny","73","237","1","103","59"

As a result  the new progression system has proven to be 4-5 x slower than it was previously to unlock the same amount of aircraft in the higher levels.\n\nThe result of all of this is that the developer has essentially covertly thru this patch increased the price and devalued their in-game currency (GE-Golden Eagles) by 4-5 times what it was pre-patch!!!\nSince it is a F2P game, it essentially means that if you decide to buy a monthly subscription it will now take you probably 4-5 months longer you need to subscribe than previously to unlock the same amount of aircraft.\nAnd I am not talking about a just a few hours here....it will now take you literaly hundreds of hours more to unlock the higher level aircraft.\n\nFor newcomers who are joining after patch 1.37 you will of course not notice any of this as you have nothing to compare the current pricing and progression but just be warned that this could happen again. I would not trust this developer again!\n\nAs a customer who bought a steam pack with a subscription and a lot of GE in-game currency before the new patch I feel totally ripped off!\n\nGaijin of course has the right to change their prices post-patch. It is their own risk or reward decision. When it comes however to devaluing the in-game GE currency for people who purchased prior to the patch at an advertised rate it is downright unethical what they have done.\n\nI have stopped playing this game as a result and I guess will never use my GE left on my account unless Gaijin makes a total turnaround and admits thier very questionable business ethics and turning their backs on previous customer base.\n\nI have lost total respect for this developer Gaijin for this and also after many people complained on their website forums about these changes and posting proof of  that the new progression system was falsely advertised and the currency de-valued, they simply deleted and ignored posts.\n\nThe WT moderators here on Steam also delete any posts which are in any way critical of these very questionable business ethics of Gaijin. I've never seen such kind of crazy censorship towards their own customers as I've seen on both the Gaijin and Steam War Thunder forums in my life.\n\nI really feel this developer should be blacklisted from selling any further products on Steam unless they offer some compensation to their customers who were caught up in this scam of suddenly overnight de-valuing their in-game currency that was bought previous to the patch.\n\nUPDATE: May 14th ->\n\nI AM CLOSING THIS REVIEW FOR ANY FURTHER COMMENTS AS I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A NEW PATCH 1.39.\n\nMY REVIEW WAS BASED ON 1.37 AND DISPLEASURE WITH THE WAY GAIJIN HANDLED THAT IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOMER RELATIONS AND BASICALLY DE-VALUING CUSTOMERS PURCHASED GE's AND IN-GAME CURRENCY WITHOUT NOTICE OR COMPENSATION.\n\nI PERSONALLY HAVE DELETED THE GAME FROM MY PC in JANUARY AFTER 1.37 AND HAVE NO INTENTION TO RETURN AND SUPPORT THIS COMPANY EVEN IF THEY MAY HAVE FINALLY MADE IMPROVEMENTS.\n\nWISH YOU ALL GOOD GAMING!","January 31, 2014","false","308.6"," 2,638 of 3,645 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","638","3","0","100"

Well, an almost embarrassingly long time. Even prior to its release on steam I played this game nonstop for a number of months. It has only been in the last six or so months that the game has soured entirely. The developers, a delightful company based in Russia called Gaijin, used to put the highest focus on gameplay and balance. They listened to the community and actually handled feed back rather well. Yet, oddly, in the last several months they seem to have put their focus on more features, more glitter in their game. They have gotten rid of the community involvement in many of the groups that have formed around the game, most noteably Reddit. (The community manager with Gaijin was removed) The community as a whole has made countless attempts to bring issues with the game to the dev's attention and have repeatedly and consistently been ignored and in some cases players were banned for voicing their concerns.\n\nGame play wise, is this game fun? The answer to that question is, "It can be." Every once in a while you might get that golden blue moon match where you're not being completely stomped by some fellow in a KV-2 and any of the heavy Russian tanks. It could be fun depending on what you drive/fly. If you prefer US tanks or planes, I wouldn't recommend trying. The Russian and German trees are a bit more enticing if you don't want to be clubbed. The main issue with the game right now is balance, or lack thereof. Shermans against Tiger IIs, 262s against Sabres, short barreled tanks being put on maps that consist of an open field with a hill in the middle trying to play against a team of long barreled snipers. Stuff of this nature is common and expected in this game and I can't bring myself to put up with it any more.

I'm going to cover the Air combat but alot of this applies to ground combat aswell.\n\nTL;DR at the bottom\n\nCommunity\n++++++++\nIf I could go back to old Warthunder (Pre 5 tier system) I would still play this game daily. This started as a great game but the dev team is just so STUPID. They constantly implement pointless and unwanted features. They don't listen to their community at all and if you so much as hint at it not being good on there website you will be instantly and permenantly banned from their forums and the moderaters for the English forums barely even speak English. (Probally with a few exceptions). This game is mostly made of new players because the devs drove away all of the vets with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Now the game just feels like a pub stomp even in the "realistic" game mode. All of the youtubers that play this game except for a few big ones have quit because the money grabbing devs.\n\nThe Never Ending Grind\n++++++++++++++++\nIt was pretty obvious that they were slowing starting to move to P2W/Progress when they added the 5 tier system. The 20 tier system allowed you to actually progress in the game instead of grinding for what seems like years for a single plane. Well if it was so much better then why did they get rid of it? So you actually have a reason to give them money duh!! In the 20 tier system every time you leveled up you would get the planes for each level so if your level 5 you get all of the planes at level 5,level 6 you get the level 6 planes, ect. Well now not only to you have to grind exp for each level but you also have to grind exp for each plane ON TOP OF HAVING TO GRIND CREDITS TO BUY THE PLANE. this makes it so depending on how much you play you may need to grind for A MONTH TO GET 1 PLANE. The only way to speed up the grind is to either: buy a premium plane, buy premium time, buy credits or buy gold to convert "Free xp" WHICH YOU HAVE TO GRIND BY PLAYING THE GAME IN THE FIRST PLACE. I thought it was called "free xp" not "pay me money so you can use the xp you ground out already :^)". I have around 2 Million "free xp" that  I could easily get a jet for but it would probally cost me anywhere from $75-150 to convert it and I refuse to give this company any money.\n\nBalancing\n+++++++\nThe 5 tier system was doomed from the start. Cramming houndreds of planes into 5 different tiers of equalness makes no sense. Which is why they brilliantly implemented "battle tiers" /sarcasm. Basically the battle tier system takes how well a plane is performing in the average players hand and appropriately places it in a 20 level battle scale. Before I even address how flawed this system is, WHY DID THEY EVEN REMOVE THE 20 TIER SYSTEM IN THE FIRST PLACE IF THEY ARE JUST GOING TO DO THIS??? Anways this battle tier system is just so flawed, like come on. Wasn't it obvious what was going to happen Gajin? When terrible players are put in good planes and perform terrible they are placed at a lower level, then good players get in the same plane and absolutely stomp. Also the nations that are played less (lets use the Japs for example) are placed very wrong on the battle tier system. Most players start off using the Americans or Russian planes. When they learn the basics of the game from getting higher levels in these nations they gravitate to the nations that are used less. So when they do good in that nation there are not enough bad players to balance out the battle tier and the planes get placed at a higher battle rating and get put against unfair opponents. This is especially true for the Japanese in realistic battles. With planes from 1939 against planes from 1942.\n\nEvery Nation is the Same\n+++++++++++++++++\nEvery single nation ends with the same planes. Even the ♥♥♥♥ing Japs have a F86 Saber. Almost every nation has an iconic premium vehicle from another nation. Americans have a Spitfire, Brits have a Mustang, ect. This makes the entire game feel pointless and cheesy, when you want to play realistic battle and try to use your light and agile Zero to out perform and out turn a clunky heavy Mustang only to be greated by the 20mms of a Premium Spitfire that some 8 year old begged his mom to buy for him.\n\nEconomy\n++++++\nThe economy for this game makes about as much sense as Russian ww1 wave charging tactics. It's pretty similiar to the battle rating system actually. Basically it takes planes that are popular and makes the prices to rearm and repair them more exspensive. Which means that the limited planes at lower levels are ridiculously pricy and make it harder to grind past. Playing the harder game modes used to pay out a much larger reward for making the player challenge themselves, now you are just barely making more than arcade mode. It is way more rewarding to just sit in a bomber at 20000 feet and drops bombs for 10 minutes wait for a fighter to spend 5 minutes to climb up to you and then suicide in the ground and respawn then to fly around and have fun in a fighter plane.\n\nSummary\n++++++\nI spent about an hour writing this review and could easilly spend days on it because this game is just so god damn bad now. I mean yeah its fun to jump in a biplane and shoot at stuff for an hour or two but when you put some serious time into it like I have you will realize that it is just one big marble block of disapointment that could have been a grand scultpure of a great game. I have put way more hours into theis game before it was even added to steam and every time I see how much time I put into this game it makes me want to kill myself. I left out a bunch of stuff because im lazy and am sick of thinking about this game.\n\nPro's\n+++\n-Flying is fun\n-Shooting is fun\nCon's\n+++\n-Literally everything else about this game","November 5, 2015","false","172.7"," 281 of 362 people (78%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","78","281","362","24","17"

The representatives are more involved with the English speaking community and most of the balance issues are being corrected, albeit slowly. With the addition of the US Army land forces faction as well as considerable efforts, I am not so certain of the not recommended review, the game itself has huge potential and will only get better as more content is created for it. I will leave the review as it is however do take a chance and try the game out since it is free, purchasing something is your decision of course.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy now most of the reviews at the Store Page of this game are negative, this alone probably communicates what the community feels accurately enough. However most of the highest voted reviews were written as an outrage towards a previous patch which had changed the unlocking method for new vehicles in game. This review will hopefully touch on a different more important issue with this game.\n\nI have played and enjoyed War-thunder for more than a year now, but stopped a while a back due to bad design decisions and overall negative behaviour from the devs. I still followed the forums and various communities however in the hopes that things might get better. At it's core it is truly an incredible game. Even with many difficult issues with the developers, I still find myself missing the thrill of flying or driving well rendered WWII machines.\n\nThe most glaring flaw with this could-be-incredible game is the crew behind it. On multiple occasions the team behind the game have shown that they do not respect their player base, ridiculing and mocking them at every opportunity.\n\nRecently after more than two years of outcry and demands from the players, the devs finally agreed to implement a 'Player Council' type of system, we have seen such initiatives from other devs in other games so this was a welcome change. However soon it became apparent that this was yet another PR move that ultimately ended up with an arrogant fit towards the players.\n\nThe community council representative that would have been chosen by the community is required (by the devs) to play the game at minium consecutively for 90 days, every day (rumours of 7 hours per week requirement) to simply keep his position. The unacceptable demands and restrictions had began. Also as a response for the currently broken system of balancing vehicles a community manager argued (with terrible unintelligible English I might add) that the community council representative can not simply relay problems of the players, no that's not enough, instead what he has to do is to provide thousand page analysis for all the 350+ Planes in the game and their real life performance to the devs FREE OF CHARGE.\n\nThat's right, the developer expects a member of the community to do their job for them free of charge to be able to simply PROPOSE changes to the inherently deeply flawed balancing system. After all that work and effort the devs reserve the right to simply ignore the proposed changes (which is their default behaviour by now)\n\nIt is easy to see past their deception. They simply answer like a bully to challenge the community to come up with a better system. “Read more then come back” Funnily enough people did write long essays about certain planes being unrealistic in game, providing photographic evidence. They got mocked in their own threads which then got locked and deleted when they started to be posted around. Devs lock and delete any and all criticism from their forums to provide a 'perfect' atmosphere for new comers, instead of working on the issues that are present in this 'Open Beta' game.\n\nAnother salt in the wound is that whenever a huge issues comes up and draws backlash from the players, everyone that complains gets the rough treatment, for months they are mocked and insulted by the team only for them to implement a change in line with the complaints months after, with the undertone that they came up with the idea themselves, or did it out of the kindness of their hearths.\n\nThis show of arrogance bordering insulting behaviour is common place today with this game. So as much as I like what the core game represents in terms of potential, such scummy behaviour is unacceptable.  As a long time fan of this game (one that was waiting impatiently for the Navy side) and as a customer that spent money on this game; I hope this game fails, not out of spite but to demolish such a negative possible influence on future developers.

Honestly i'm writing this because the War Thunder forums are run by a very strict set of rules that don't really allow much actual discussion outside of vicious attacks against a dissatisfied playerbase by elitist, relatively new players, so I cant even post a mild suggestion that something is wrong with the staff as there is nowhere to put it within the rules.\n\nThe game's moderators, forum and community suck ♥♥♥. It takes a very Russian view on the rights of the consumer when it comes to moderating.\n\nThis is the reason why so many of the old guard, players who have been around since 2012, have left. People who play the game for a long time usually like to participate in the community to help the game grow. But often they are sensible people, and in Gaijin's view those people can "disrupt new players experience" with vile topics like "Gaijin, can you please fix the netcode?" (locked and hidden, 3/14/2014) and "Beta is not an excuse" (locked and hidden 9/08/2014).  But who are the people that protect us from these disruptive and evil comments?\n\n\nhttp://puu.sh/g5NqW/5c217d7d6d.jpg\n\n\n25 Year old, foreign-speaking Brony moderators. Let's elaborate on these issues using this single puush image as a base.\n\nIt does not show it but this moderator, and in fact nearly ALL of them, do not speak English very well if at all. That applies to much of this game. Many patch notes and information released by moderators is written in commie and myself and other dedicated players are forced to try and decipher them with Google translate to figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ they broke this time. Often the reasons given for doing something so ahistorical that it's insulting (when the game claims to try and be historically authentic) is that they found, and I kid you not, "Secret documents in a forgotten Soviet bunker." This is a real thing. It's even a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ meme!\n\nThis lack of English and information also applies to many other trivial things like ban messages and explanations. A friend of mine was banned by this very moderator for having the name "AllahIsGreat" and we could not figure out why this was offensive when the friend in question is actually a Muslim. Appeals are usually met with garbled, confused English that roughly translate into "You're toxic to new players" 90% of the time.\n\nThe biggest issue with this game's hilariously strict moderation, though, is the fact that topics with criticism that the brony lords don't like can be shut down and hidden because they "hurt new players."\n\n\nThis will not affect many of you, who simply wish to casually play this game and try to participate as little as possible in the mess that is the War Thunder Community. If you do, in between the bans and thread locking, you will find quite a few nice people as the European/American playerbase is wonderful. But even in the chat of public games there are Russian NKVD mods who watch intently what you say.\n\nThis is not a comprehensive or even gameplay-focused review, nor a tired "10/10 it was gud ign" review, but you can find that in every single other review above or below me. I simply wanted to post this here considering the hilarity of permabanning a friend of mine for having an Islamic name when he is, in fact, Muslim. I do play this game a lot and enjoy it, and that is because I joined before ♥♥♥♥ hit the fan and the decade-long grind (bypassable by large sums of money) was introduced, and had all my stuff before things went bad. Seriously, you better quit your dayjob if you intend to progress in any meaningful way in this game.\nThanks for reading, and hopefully I can talk more about these issues that plague War Thunder in the future.\n\nEDIT: They just made the grind even longer by removing daily bonuses and making us use this random drop system, which will most likely give you a "Research Point Boost" rather than an experience/currency boost which the daily bonuses gave. Other than modifications Research Points are only usable using real money.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/2xgo4v/psa_boosters_dont_multiply_missionreward_premium/ Showing how Gaijin once again screws over their players with lies and inflation.\n\n\nAdditional Reading:\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/2x8i1a/147_is_a_failure_of_a_patch_wts_failings_found/\n\nClarification:\nRussian patchnotes are much larger and more detailed than the English ones.\n\nThe English patchnotes only explain generalities (I.E. "Tempest Mk II has been tuned according to data sheet").\n\nRussian patchnotes will explain details (I.E. "Tempest Mk II speed changed from <bad> to <worse>).\n\nAnd, yes, English moderators exist, but they are a staggering minority.","February 20, 2015","false","677.1"," 679 of 932 people (73%) found this review helpful 72 people found this review funny","73","679","932","72","79"

In the beginning the game had organized matches the ranged from level 1 planes to level 20, but that was thrown out the window for a poorly implemented 1-5 tier system. The effects of fighter combat is still relatively good, you can take hits in your landing gear,chip a wing, lose a flap or propeller and "possibly" still land it to be repaired. Aside from that it is a total clusterf**k of unorganized and biased combat.The new leveling system was implemented to "so called" make leveling faster, but fans pooring in data proved the latter. Leveling has become a loong grind compared to the false imformation Gaijin provided. They pretty much want you to go Premium just so you can level at the old "normal" speed.\n\n[ GRAPHICS ] The engine behind it is quite beautiful, almost any pc can run this game and the graphic settings can be tweaked so you can either have an intense and beautiful battle, or an optimized battle that still has decent graphics and details. So even your "lawnmower taped to a powersupply and running off gas computer" should be able to run it with ease given some tweaks.\n\n[ ISSUES THAT PLAGUE, AND WILL TURN AWAY LONG TIME PLAYERS ] The real issue is the constant problems with unbalanced matches, unrealistic plane mechanics, and pro russian biased company.\n-The 1-5 tier matching is complete garbage, You will often face planes that should not be in that tier/ or glitched using squad jumping( 4 players, 1 in a tier 2 setup, other players using tier 3).People use this method to use a higher ranked tier plane to literally slaughter underpowered tier planes in a lower tier match. The match making system is broken and has been unaddressed for months.\n- The plane mechanics themselves though looking beautiful dont match up to the real statistics of how that plane performed during the war.Players have made spreadsheets upon spreadsheets of data comparing both real world war data against the game and find it very off. So many planes either underperform or overperform there real world possibilities.\n- Finally, as an unwritten and talked about problem of WT, is how Gaijin: a russian game development company has been biased towards the russian nation in the game. As sad as it is, it has been proven by the fans of the game how badly biased the company has become. Almost ALL Russian planes throughout all tiers outperform in every aspect of combat. Russian planes can outturn, out climb, out run, and out gun every single nation aside from the japanese.Again when comparing real world plane statistics/data to the games counterpart it was far off in comparison. Not even the fire rate of the guns was even close to the real thing.\n\nSo this is why I give it a thumbs down. The game is fun for a week or two but becomes quite old after being slaughtered by higher tiered planes in a lower tier match and being out performed all the time by russian biased planes.","May 2, 2014","false","257.9"," 508 of 690 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","508","690","0","13"

It had great graphics, fun gameplay, a brilliant free-to-play system with only modest rewards for those willing to pay, and an easy recipe for success.\n\nUnfortunately, the Russian-based Gaijin apparently decided they no longer needed any of that in their game, and have been working tirelessly to remove any inkling of fun the game might have once had.\n\nSince the 1.37 Patch was released, the player population of the game has stagnated to the point where the only players you'll encounter are either the Die-Hard Russian fanatics or the "too stupid to quit playing" crowd. Up until today, I was in that latter category. No more. I've had it.\n\nThe planes are ridiculous in every game mode - almost none of them bearing any sort of truthful resemblence to their real-life counterparts. The weapons are comical at best - with machine guns that literally do no damage and bombs that make you pull your hair out and wonder why the citizens of Dresden were so upset. The maps are extremely tired and repeat themselves so often that you begin to quit matches before they even load, because you know exactly what Pacific Hidden Base is going to be. The game types sound wonderful on paper, but in practice are so amazingly bad that once the honeymoon phase wears off and you begin to earnestly focus on the gameplay, you realize that these guys (the programmers) have absolutely no clue what's fun and what isn't.\n\nThey're falling the way of Blizzard - where every patch removes another desperately needed piece of the "fun" equation. Yet unlike Blizzard, who calmly acknowledge that they're ruining their games with words like "casual" and "approachability," these dumb Ruskies instead completely ignore their playerbase. Totally. Even mentioning a gripe with the game on their official forums will warrant you a ban - almost immediately. Have a problem with a player in game? Report them! But beware - if you report one player multiple times (for example, you notice them cheating, so you report it, then they use a racist term towards you, so you report them again) you'll be the one banned. Notice a group of players cheating? Don't even bother - the moment you start reporting multiple people in one round, you're getting banned.\n\nDo you see where I'm going with this?\n\nCouple that with the unending stream of new cheats and hacks that are coming out almost daily, and it's plain to see why the popularity of this game has rapidly decreased. Do yourself a favor and wait for something better to come along.","March 24, 2014","false","226.4"," 406 of 546 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","406","546","0","7"

I love to know why things happened, the reasons, the causes, the impacts upon how we see things today, and what it can mean for those who care to enjoy their history.\n\nSo, as I write this review, keep the words "Historical", "Accurate", and "Fair" in mind. Cause they'll be mentioned a lot.\n\nHistorical planes, tanks and ships, all clashing upon one battlefield that allows players to simultaneous and fairly enjoy how these various war machines of history would have performed under the accurate scrutiny of Gaijin's developers who no doubt have the best interest of this game at heart, right? But what game are we playing, if not War Thunder? A game advertised as historically accurate and fair to all countries in how they are represented historically to players? Knowing they're targetting both a large audience who -wants- a fun combat flight simulator game which boasts accuracy; and simultaneously knowing they're targetting the history buffs and adamant learners who want to gleefully roar through the skies as a P-47 Thunderbolt over 1940's Germany. Surely! They would want to represent the lives lost, the battles won, and the ingenuity of men and women of this war accurately, right?\n\nNow, take every mention of those words I told you to notice before, and answer them with "No". This game was praised as the champion against other games like World of Tanks, where World of Tanks and it's corporate model is to force all players into mediocrity and a 50% win/loss range than to be fair (look up Greedy Goblin's World of Tanks article, then you will agree). Even I came in when War Thunder had almost one-quarter the number of planes is has now, and was boasted as being historically accurate.\n\nThose days are long gone, I've put in well over 300 hours of my life trying to enjoy this game. The only times I authentically enjoyed this game is when I broke down and submitted to the mentality of my close friends who call this game by it's true name: "GLORIOUS SOVIET UNION COMRADE VICTORY SIMULATOR"*. By this, I mean, I started playing nothing but Soviet Russian planes, I watched in initial glee as my scores skyrocketted. I went from being the bottom 5 players to the top 5. Then the horror hit me. I was indoctrinated. I had spent cash to turn around from the planes I -wanted- to -desperately- enjoy, yet I can't due to the GSUCVS* and it's portrayal of Russian warplanes as nigh-unstoppable machines of complete devestation.\n\nI spent cash to enjoy the best of the United States circa 1940's era planes I always wanted to fly; I spent cash and time to work up the German Luftwaffe planes, where I finally hit my peak into indoctrination. That is when I spent cash to play Soviet Russian planes like everyone else, just so my above-average flight skills aren't being held back because a single Russian plane can endure over 1000 rounds of .50 caliber anti-air machinegun fire. So my enjoyment and money spent on my "dud planes" with other factions was turned around and then I learned the "glory" of the GSUCVS*. It's taken me some time, it really has. But I can finally say, without the shadow of any doubt...\n\nThis game as made for Russians, by Russians, and most likely at gunpoint by Joseph Stalin himself, or at least by the specter of Stalin. The only hope to redeem this game would be to overhaul it, cut out the busywork of all the "prototype" and "testbed" planes that keep you from enjoying the plane you really want. Cut out the horribly overpowered and unbalaned and unfair Russian cheat engine for Russian planes. And lasty, to apologize to every player for their grievous wounds inflicted upon trying to represent "accurate" history.\n\nUntil then, I will not recommend this game unless you understand that it is NOT an accurate game, that it is a game made to pander towards old Soviet diehards who can't see Mother Russia as anything but completely indomitable and constantly producing instant-win scenarios. Play it, but do NOT spend your cash. Play it, but do NOT bother commenting on their EU/USA forums. They will simply mock you with sock puppets while they ban your forum account.","October 17, 2014","false","495.3"," 724 of 1,006 people (72%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","72","724","1","52","26"

Unlike WoT, which I have played an estimated 2000 hours of,  War Thunder's tanks and airplanes actually fight like airplanes.  Hit the engine?  The tank might burst into flames but probably won't.  Hit the commander's hatch?  The tank isn't going to magically burst into flames like in WoT.  I love War Thunder, and I am so glad it exists.  The developers are nice and like to involve the community and the gameplay is significantly more interesting overall.\n\nHowever, they have some of the very worst business practices of any F2P I've ever known.  If you buy "premium time", the game will ask if you want to buy more incessantly the moment it expires.  They've doubled their prices on packs before the Summer Sale for the second year in a row (which is completely illegal).  They even made non-steam packs on their website to get around giving Steam a portion of the proceeds.\n\nWhen the business side of War Thunder becomes this cash-grab, no matter how much money I want to give them for making a solid game, I just can't justify it.  I can't justify giving them more money just so they can program more ways to take it away.\n\nWhile this is the best tank game on the market...save your wallet.

When I first began playing this game, it was a plucky contender in the air warfare scene, brought something new to it, and Gaijin Entertainment seemed to be listening and working with the community. It had its problems, but it was fun. Over time, however.... Things change.\n\nThe state of the game now is... Alright. Mechanically, it's very good, aside from certian nations air rounds having more proclivity to "spark" (indicate a hit but do no damage) than others. However, balancing issues, along with a few bugs, remain present, and affect the game experience greatly. This alone wouldn't be enough for me to permanantly condemn the game, but Gaijin itself has also changed. Its stance towards the community has gone from acceptance, to outright ignorance, and seemingly insane greed. If you -do- get this game, never buy Golden Eagles. Their value is minimal at best these days.\n\nI could list the iunnumerable balance issues Gaijin has forced upon the game to further increase the time it takes to progress, and squeeze as much money out of you as possible, but there are plenty of people that do it much better than I can on a review. Just a suggestion, however; avoid any source that is attached to Gaijin itself. They do thier best to censor criticisms. And this is the main reason I cannot at all reccomend this game. If the company controlling it cannot bare to own up to thier own mistakes, I simply cannot see it progressing further than it has, let alone getting any better.\n\nIt's a shame, really...

The Russian tanks however, seem to dominate the game, with one-shots on nearly every single tank they come accross.\n\nA few years ago (before War Thunder groundforces) the American faction was experiencing the same problems. The American planes had extremely low max speeds such as the Hellcat having a max speed of 200 km/h. This was made note of many of War Thunder's fans and eventurely, (although not completely) War Thunder made American planes somewhat more operable.\n\nHopefully by next update War Thunder won't make such another mistake, although it is unlikely.","November 22, 2015","false","400.6"," 113 of 138 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","113","138","5","6"

This game is quite a solid platform, everything performs, mostly, as it should, and we're getting British Tanks soon. That's bound to appeal to more than one might imagine. The updates, for the most part? Reasonable. The amount of ridiculousness from those Yak-9s going through the roof? Yes, but this is why you get either a plane that can reasonably ensnare the little sky devils or go AAA if possible. Simulation is quite nice (Despite me sucking at them to an absolute degree), Realistic plays fine, and if you're not keen on either, Arcade will likely hold what you want. None of these are faulty.\n\nIt's the moderation base and the lack of caring that make me hit "No" on the recommendations panel. The worst bit? They'll silence you if you speak up against them about it. For God's sake, we're trying to help you, and you shoot us down like we're nothing but scrubs? And by the way, that is even if you pay. They don't care who you are, you'll get shut up, one way or another.\n\nAnother key problem is the graphics. ...what, you were expecting me to say Battle Rating? Find another review, they'll explain it. I personally find it hilarious when I gun down a plane with a BR higher than mine.\n\nLet's get this out of the way. Like the core gameplay, the core graphics are not an issue. Heck, they're some of the most beautiful to date. For those who play Realistic, I'm sure you'll agree with me on this if you play Ground Forces in Realistic or Simulator: There is an option within the game settings to turn the bushes OFF. Yeah, not down to a minimum, outright OFF. This is a huge problem that Gaijin refuses to fix, and it's impacting Realistic Ground Battles to this day. (And Simulator, but Realistic at the least) It's understandable for low-end PCs, but this is straight up an advantage for players who want to shoot you while you're not even able to see them if you have your bushes on.\n\nThis, and especially the lack of a caring development base, are what make me not recommend this game. If what it takes for me to change my mind is an administrative reform at Gaijin Entertainment, then so help me Arceus, do it.\n\n...on the flip side though, if you're just someone who just enjoys a good tank and plane game, once all this settles down, it's a good game. Just...don't go talking negative within the game if you expect to stay there. And hope you have fun out there.","August 26, 2015","false","389.4"," 99 of 118 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","99","118","0","1"

I've played War Thunder for a few years now, and it has finally reached the point that I can no longer play the game in its current state. I'm going to say now that I am a JET PILOT and some of these points only apply to JET COMBAT. I'm also going to try and list the points I still like, and that I find noteworthy.\n\nPros:\n-A good arcade flight experience.\n-A nice variety of vehicles to drive.\n-Fairly realistic physics.\n\nCons:\n-The community moderators censor feedback, and even youtubers like MagzTv and PhlyDaily have been hit with claims, though these claims were rescinded. Simply put, only positive feedback is allowed.\n-Jet combat is hopelessly unbalanced for new jet pilots. If you have a MiG-15, F-86 or Hunter F1, you'll be fine. If you're just getting into jet combat, be prepared for a horrible grind, or prepare to open your wallet.\n-The company treats its playerbase like idiots. They refuse to share any information on the statistics they use to balance the battle ratings, claiming we won't be able to understand them.\n-The instructor system in realistic prevents players from gettoing out of flatspins, which can happen in midair rams. Its not a bad system, but the inability to turn it off completely without using a joystick in infuriating.\n-The company moderators also have the devil's own job of trying to defend the companys actions. This can lead to problems with historical accuracy. This is a quote from a community manager:\n\n"The actual performance of the Meteor and Venom in fact exceed the performace of all F-86 series aircraft"\n\nThis is once again referencing the statistics that we are not allowed to see, making sweeping generalisations and in general rebuffing the requests of the community for a rebalance in battle ratings.\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend this game to anyone, I have lost my faith in Gaijin entertainment, and I hope in future they fix these issues so I can give them a more positive review. Will I keep playing it? Yeah, until my premium time runs out, then it can sit in my steam library til its fixed.","January 29","false","699.5"," 85 of 98 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","85","98","7","4"

Straight up, no questions about it. they have created a game that is so awesome, that even when they throw historical facts out the window, thousands flock to sing its praises. This game is like no other, it has no real competitors, and therefore, Gaijin gets to do whatever the heck they want to, and we will still play. This game has a ridiculous bias, it can be overcome, but it shoudn't have to be. The fact is, if I fly a Fw190 D9, one of my best planes, I will be on par with a totally unexperienced Yak-3P pilot. There is something wrong with that. I don't mind unbalanced combat, but I sure as hell want historically accurate combat. I wouldn't mind if match making put 15 Russian players on each russian team, and 5 on the german team, but they should have those german tanks/planes historically accurate, and therefore vastly superior to their Russian counterparts.","December 12, 2015","false","730.7"," 113 of 140 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","113","140","6","14"

I was a late player to the scene.  I didn't start playing War Thunder until a couple of months ago.  It was such a fun experience and I would play constantly.  At first things didn't seem so bad, but then I got a glimpse of what the veteran WT players were so upset about.\n\nThe system that they use for research is DESIGNED TO MAKE YOU SPEND ALL YOUR  MONEY!  At first I was unlocking things at a pretty decent rate.  Now, It's like I hit a brick wall and the only way to get past it, is to pay REAL MONEY to use the experience that I have already earned.\n\nLook gajian, I'm not a game programmer or some sort of buisness man, but you guys are really dropping the ball.  Want to know how to bring people back to your game?  Here are 3 ways.\n\n1.  Hire moderators and curators who actually have respect for both new and old players.  Based on some of the evidence brought forth by other people, your moderators are incredibly rude and drunk with the power of the banhammer.\n\n2.  I understand that free to play games need to be set up in a way so that it is still profitable, but that doesn't mean charging premium currency for as much as you can get away.  500 golden eagles to buy a national flag for your tank/plane is beyond the realm of reasonable.\n\n3. I really shouldn't have to even say this but, LISTEN TO YOUR PLAYERS!  Constructive critisism sucks, but it is better to learn from it, then to ignore the advice, do what you guys want, and say screw you to the plebs and to your own game!\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nWar Thunder is a terrific game.  It has features and gameplay that no other game has been able to repeat.  The problem with that, is if a company knows there is no real competition (Gajian), they are free to charge what they want, for whatever they want.  Don't get me wrong, I will still play WarThunder from time to time, but I won't be dropping another cent on this game.  When it comes to scuzzy business tactics, I don't have much empathy for a company.\n\nIf you plan on playing this here and there, then disregard my review.  If however, you are someone who really wants to get into this game, be warned that you WILL BE REQUIRED to spend money unless you're cool playing 3000+ hours to unlock things naturally and don't mind having only a few crew  slots.","April 12, 2015","false","347.9"," 167 of 220 people (76%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","76","167","220","8","5"

For one, all aircraft are 25% less reserch points. It still takes a long time to unloack all aircraft, but at least they're making some effort to balance the progression curve.\n\n1.39 has also massively dropped the price of aircraft (and slightly dropped the price of repairs), in some cases aircraft are 1/3 of the lion price they were. Again, a step in the right direction. Original review content is below, most of the bullet points are the same.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs much as I want to, I can't reccomend this game. Gajin seems to have turned it into a money farm. Progression was always a problem in the game. pre patch 1.37 money was a problem. If you wanted to buy all the aircraft of a rank you had to either grind hard or buy premium currency. It was a constant complaint on the forums. Did Gajin listen? nope!\n\nPost patch 1.37 the problem is even worse. Money is still an issue, only now you have to research aircraft individually. Other members have done the math on this showing that it slows progression and devalues premium currency by 4-5x. The progression curve is broken. So broken that it's kind of pointless to switch between countries. if you want a jet before your 60th birthday, you grind the hell out of one country until your brain melts.\n\nThis saddens me. The game itself is wonderfully fun. The way the devs have handled it makes me want to puke. If you do play, play for free. Don't give them your money like I did.","April 8, 2014","false","522.8"," 423 of 598 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","423","598","0","3"

You will not find another game similar to this one. It is one based more on skill than anything else. No stupid reaction shots or super quick decision making. With one good shot, someone(Including you) can be killed. If not, it may take minutes to destroy a wing or light them on fire. But, then the downsides come in. Recently, they completely overhalled the matchmaking system. Maybe you've heard. They collapsed the 20 teir system into 5 teirs. And if that weren't bad enough, they changed the way of getting planes as well. Instead of leveling up a teir, which may give you 2-3 planes at once, they made  it so that you "research" each plane at a time. This makes it unbelievably grindy. in the end, it seems like a cheap way to get more people to buy in game "golden eagles" to boost research. WIth true FTP, you will be spending hours and hours just to get a planes in low teir. If you love to grind for hours with the same planes and no real sign of progression, this is the perfect game for you. I continue to play just in hopes they change it. But as for 10-19-2014, they haven't.\n\nUpdate on 12-21-2014\nAs of the new update...I am speechless. Gaijin realy, really hates this game. They, for some reason, feel so pressured to release American tanks that they have not a care in the world for anything else. They put in an under-teired plane here, another OP plane over there... You get the point. The banshee...No comment. They feel that a plane that has a rediculous energy retention and almost a thousand kph top speed belongs in the lowest teir of jets. Flown correctly(not that hard) a person can defeat a whole team of German jets. The new British jet doesn't even have a finished flight model. And obviously the worst of all, they have delayed the implication of the proposed "fix" to the battle rating system. That would have made the game half decent again...maybe. But it doesn't matter if they keep the current cash cow of a system they currently have. I rarely...RARELY play this game anymore. It just isn't fun. I have tried realistic battles, and those are better, but seeing planes on my team that are 2 teirs under me when playing just... just isn't fair for them. Arcade, which i presume most players will spend most of their time in, just feels like a huge cluster ♥♥♥♥. All in all, I don't recomment even downloading this game at it's current state. Don't fall for the huge money trap that is War Thunder.","October 19, 2014","false","259.5"," 318 of 451 people (71%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","71","318","451","7","9"

So then you buy premium and a premium plane to help get tier 4 and 5.  You finally get your first jet, or your first tier 4 or 5 tank.  But guess what, you have to grind modules to make your plane or tank even worth using.  Tanks are especially the worst.  God help you if you get a tier 5 tank.  You will need to grind parts to even repair your tank, after that you need to grind again to unlock fire extinguishers.  The developers just outright ignore the community and the forums are comparable to, if not worse than early 1940's Germany.  The CEO of the game practically called all the player base "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s".  Please don't waste your time on this game.  If you read other reviews, most people with less than 500 hours like this game.  Most with over 500 don't like it.

Adding unecessary ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like planes no one likes or knows, forcing you to buy and research planes to get the next one, and this applies to ALL planes. Unlike before, you could skip the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ planes you didn't want. You even have to pay for putting your country's flag on your plane. A F****** FLAG. You know those Plane camos you like? Pretty cool right? You have a choice of paying about a dollar or grind the F*** out of it. AND I MEAN GRIND YOUR F****** ♥♥♥ OFF. JUST FOR A PLANE CAMO. If that isn't enough to ♥♥♥♥ you off, Gaijin(The devs) have the BALLS to go and announce that the game is balanced.\n\nIT. IS. NOT.\n\nThe Russian planes are so F****** undertiered, That you can't actually face the REAL planes they faced in WW2. The LAGG-3 variants were so ♥♥♥♥ IRL, should be the same here right? (Pardon me) ♥♥♥♥. NO.\nThey are the most overpowered piece of ♥♥♥♥ you will ♥♥♥♥ing see at tier 1. You have a 20mm and 2 12,7s. Sounds not too bad right? Well, the only problem is, the closest thing that comes to that is The American F2F-3 Buffalo. WHICH HAS 4 12.7s. Now here's the thing.\n\nYour cannon is so ♥♥♥♥ing op. you can actually take down a plane in 1 hit. WITHOUT HITTING ANY VITAL PARTS OR AIMING AT ANY. I am not ♥♥♥♥ing joking.

I started playing 2-3 years ago, and even back then they didn't know what they were doing, but at least they seemed like they were trying. They listened to the community sometimes, but now... too many bad changes and patches that don't seem to be letting up any time soon. Now they refuse to listen to the community. The first 6 months are fun for some due to ignorance of the grand scheme of things in terms of issues, plus the early tier planes are the most fun, but after that it spirals quickly out of control and becomes not fun anymore. Even going back and playing the old planes isn't fun for me. The matchmaking changes have been horrible, and (as much as its overstated sometimes), there's a debatable Russian bias and they straight up retcon history sometimes.\n\nI love the game to death, it has so much potential, and there's nothing more that I would love to see than this game to become what it could be, but as long as its in the hands of such an unorganized and dysfunctional development team, that won't be happening any time soon. This game is the epitome of one of those FPS's that seem promising for the first few months, and then you realize how much of a grind it really is.\n\nIt's not even just the fact that it's a grind, it's not about taking forever to unlock planes, it's not about the fact that it will take the average user about a year to get their first jet, because it's possible to have fun in this game without jets. In fact, jets are one of the most unbalanced and un-fun parts of this game, besides ground forces. The early tiers are some of the most fun, in fact. That's why you so often see players with about 100 hours or less giving WarThunder positive reviews, yet as you go up through the hours, most of those players start giving negative reviews.\n\nThe real issues lie in the dev team's unwillingness to listen to the community, their horrid, horrid, HORRID mod team who watch over their forums like hawks and strike down almost all criticisms of the game with impunity, it lies in the fact that they've made some painfully obvious cash grabs in the game, like making it so you have to pay for country flags because "teamkilling was an issue." Most of the community, if not all, wants the game to succeed. We offer criticisms and ways to fix the issues, they give us bans, longer grinds, and horrible BRs.\n\nThe dev team's unwillingness to not only fix the FM issues, but even their complete failure to acknowledge them, means that the game is doomed if it continues on the path it's currently on. BRs are complete trash, if you aren't flying the flavor of the month plane then you might as well not be flying. If you're not driving a Russian tank, you might as well not be driving.\n\nNow, because of Gaijin's failures, hundreds of veterans like me, and others with even more time in the game than me, are jumping ship. Not because we don't care about the game anymore, but because Gaijin doesn't. Its sad because most  bad review of this game is from a player who has played for a long time, and most of the good ones are from complete new users who are still able to enjoy the game before they realize how truly bad the situation is.\n\nThe nation balance is garbage. Japan gets screwed over soooooo much. Germany has been getting pounded on, or at least was last time I played, Russia has always had curbstomping abilities over the other nations, and the US flip flops depending on the tier. British are just everywhere. I personally stopped playing consistently about the time when ground forces started having the issue with the foliage, where you would be at a severe disadvantage (and I'm talking gamebreaking severe) if you kept your grass/foliage on. I have logged on a handful of times since, but only for 2-3 rounds and then I just get tired and sad. I want the game to be good. The sad thing is, though I have been playing for 2-3 even back then and through the years, I can never truly say the game has felt completely good. There have always been a number of broken FMs, the economy has gone through various levels of ♥♥♥♥, one nation is always curbstomping another, etc. About the time they removed the 2x bonus, that's when the crashing spiral downward in quality started.\n\nGaijin's PR is horrible, especially with their whole "guys, don't judge, we're still in beta" excuse which has been a lie ever since you've been able to pay to get ahead in the game. It's been a lie ever since they started using it as an excuse to disregard their personal flaws and using it as a way to completely shift the blame from them over to the community. It's been a lie because most games in beta survey the userbase, asking for feedback, while Gaijin denies feedback at every opportunity. Ever since their PR team straight up quit the subreddit, calling it a "toxic environment", most likely due to the fact that they were unable to control what was said (unlike their forums, where they have total control and use that control freely), there was no hope for their PR team. A development team that will readily call their community, who offers criticisms and only wants to help the game get better (though I do concede that a lot of the players will get pissy after a bad patch, but who can really blame them?) isn't fit to run a game.\n\nI really do want this game to be good. But as long as it continues on the path it's currently treading on, I will not recommend it, or play it.","September 26, 2015","false","122.1"," 73 of 85 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","73","85","0","0"

Somehow, I fitted right in, getting a lot of kills, unlocking plane after plane. The game was extremely friendly to it's players, I never had the feeling that I was underpowered or anything. It was just awesome, especially cooping with friends. The game breathed the love for military aviation, it was a dream come true for me. The gameplay was just heartpounding fun as you twisted and turned to get behind your opponents. The historical battles were fun too. Moreover, you had an easy custom single player mode to brush up on your flying skills offline, which was very useful, since I wanted to make the jump to Simulator difficulty. You just had so much content in this game. Had.\n\nThen along came patch 1.37. The sky is now filled with nearly invincible ME-109's and La-7's, stuffed with cannons. Arcade dogfights have lost all appeal to me. Now it is just 'fly at each other with all guns blazing'. No tactics, no teamplay, no interesting dogfights. Any one-on-one dogfights are a thing of the past, the battlefield is just a frantic swirl of flying cannonballs without logic. It has nothing to do with flying or dogfighting anymore. In fact, the more I learned about fighter-tactics, the worse I became on this game. Unlocking planes is a thing of the past as well. Researching ANY plane takes ridicilously much time. The only way to speed up the process is -of course- by paying lots of money. Oh, and should you eventually manage to research and buy a game, it will have reduced speed, agility, armor, everything, just to make sure you have to pay again to unf*** your brand new plane. Moreover, this upgrade-system makes all historical accuracy obsolete, since a plane that historically is lower in turn-rate for example, can now outturn a not upgraded airplane that should have superior turning abilities.\nThe easy customizable missions from the single player have dissappeared altogether. Now you get to chose between flying missions with a scenario fully controlled by the game, and not the player, or flying practice missions against biplanes and real life players. The latter are usually beginners, or dudes who want to test their brand new jet on easy prey. Not much practice there. And you need it to overcome the immensely steep learning curve to Simulator battles. Because of this, almost no-one plays this mode anymore. Gaijin scared away their first fans: the flight-sim boys.\nLuckily, the historial battles remain, together with the events-mode. This is an oasis of relief in an ever deteriorating game. Matchmaking is seemingly more fair here, teamplay is more important, and historical accuracy is restored a little. However, there are not much players on this mode, the learning curve is very steep, the waiting time for a match is quite high, and the absence of room for mistakes makes this game mode very difficult for new players.\n\nIn sum, a charm of a game has turned into a mean money-making machine, discarding it's fans of the first hour in favor of the arcade-shooter public with big wallets. The player-friendly environment has turned into a frustrating grind and totally uninteresting gameplay (in arcade mode), focused only on making money. My sad conclusion: if you like planes and dogfighting, look somewhere else. It may seem cool if this is your first time on this game, but believe me, it is nothing compared to what it once was.","January 18, 2014","false","108.4"," 410 of 592 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","410","592","0","8"

I was once flying my Tier 4 Me410 U1/A4 and I hit a Tier 2 Yak with a 50mm Air Target round... The Yak survived... This has happened more than once.

Now, because the developer is doing all of this whilst the rest of the game is unfinished, no criticism should be reigned because it is still in beta. Following that logic, I’ll give a summary list of my gripes discovered through the 200+ hours I’ve had in the beta.\n\nThe replay system is horribly unfinished. The UI for it is almost entirely missing, along with the entire in-game chat. Bomber turrets do not animate, and sounds are frequently absent.\n\nThe in-game UI is poor, is often hard to see against the terrain or background, and does not do enough to convey information to the player. Useful details such as the fuel timer are inexplicably disabled by default.\n\nThe game menus are an improvement, but once again, certain pieces of information are hard to see at first glance, or obscured in another menu. For example, you cannot view the historical data on your selected plane unless you enter the customisation hangar.\n\nThe matchmaking system is incredibly frustrating, badly designed, and made even worse than before due to recent changes. Matchmaking will never be perfect in any game, but in War Thunder, I have nothing positive to say about this atrocious system. Games should never punish players for doing well, being skilled, or playing with their friends, yet that is exactly what this system does.\n\nThe spread of planes across nations is strange, with firepower and battlefield roles varying greatly. Not every nation has access to a fighter-bomber or bomber early-on (particularly Germany), some nations have a wider variety of fighters (Russia, for example), and some fighters are too well-armed and too manoeuvrable for their level (again, a game balance issue). Some planes, such as the Swordfish, a British torpedo bi-plane, are rendered useless due to a complete absence of naval targets for their level. Some planes are the opposite - the I-153 Soviet bi-plane has unique access to rockets and bombs, which all other bi-planes do not have.\n\nMost plane names are given as easy-to-confuse number & letter designations, despite the fact that all planes had names. Even after 200+ hours, I could not remember that the Ju-87 is a Stuka! I can remember Blenheim, Swordfish, Spitfire etc, but the others? I had to correct this review because I got the Ki-53 mixed-up with the I-153, so in most matches I had no idea what I was fighting!\n\nThe currency system is completely and utterly irrelevant to the game. Ammunition and repair purchasing is trivial; the currency system exists as a lever through which the developer can push their micro-transactions and progression-purchasing.\n\nThe progression system, as mentioned, is deliberately slow to encourage purchasing. This is compounded by experience for each plane crew, for each nation, being different. This actively discourages players from trying other nations, and does nothing beneficial for the experience.\n\nWorthy of note is the Ace qualification. This is a plane crew upgrade which cannot be earned through the in-game currency and normal play. It is an upgrade which can only be purchased with real money and adds a significant amount of power to your plane and stacks with the other crew qualifications. Here, more than anywhere else in War Thunder, is the definition of ‘pay-to-win’, and there should be no argument. This is a purchase of power, with real money, which has a direct impact on game balance and cannot be earned through in-game progression.\n\nThe patching system through the launcher is atrocious, CPU intensive, and has twice prevented me from playing for over a week. The launcher uses their own custom torrenting system which is vastly inferior to any freely-available torrent software. Because it refused to function correctly, I was unable to play War Thunder for two months since the last big patch. I had to get a copy of the game files (all in Russian) through BitTorrent in order to get it working. The fact that this system remains unchanged is beyond ridiculous.\n\nThere are added problems in Historic and Full-Real Battles (or whatever they’re called now). I have encountered issues with the in-game Instructor fighting me for control of the plane. This was particularly evident during the first few attempts of Historic mode, when I would crash uncontrollably on the runway or slowly drop out of the sky. Even when disabled, the game Instructor regularly fights the player for control of the plane during a sharp but controllable turn. This causes the plane to wobble alarmingly during a turn, forcing it to turn even slower than usual.\n\nThe above problem does not exist in Arcade mode, because the problem comes as part of the ‘realism’ package that makes the plane handling sluggish. There are also issues with fuel tank sizes being too small for some lower-level planes, and maps being too big (the two problems are linked, by the way).\n\nTo briefly mention the Meta problems . . .\n\nI have noticed an alarming attitude with regards to the three game modes, particularly from moderators. The opinion of the invested is to snub arcade mode and those who play it as being sub-par, with the prevailing defence for complaints being: ‘you do not have a right to complain about game balance if you play arcade mode’. Frankly this is a rather disgusting attitude to have, which I suppose could be akin to some sort of elitism. I have played many hours on Historic mode and if you put the choice to me I would choose Arcade in a heartbeat. If Historic / Full-Real are “the way it’s meant to be played”, then it should actually be fun to fly the bally planes!\n\nAnd finally, Gaijin Entertainment is also notable for the trademark abuse and legal bullying of Brandon Harris which started in May 2013 and is STILL ongoing (I can’t link here, but I recommend you search for that). Couple this with allegations of censorship of criticism on forums they control, and you have further relevant information for anyone considering a purchase of War Thunder.\n\nSo how can I conclude this?\n\nThe sad part is that there is a terrific warplane simulator here, which feels great to fly, has a reliable physics engine, and has realistic damage models that put rival titles to shame. But all of this is buried under bad design decisions, micro-transactions, and a company of dubious integrity which I do not trust to fix War Thunder’s problems before launch.","January 3, 2014","false","217.8"," 167 of 230 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","167","230","0","19"

So yeah. Not bragging but this is pretty much a valid review instead of "this person is definitely paid by the other company". Playing this game isn't something I'm proud of anyway, I don't write "I've played Warthunder for a long time" on my resume.UPDATE 2: Some minor edit.UPDATE 3: Some more edit.As always, something gets into me and I reinstalled the game as 1.57 released. As always I won't recommend this "game." As always, few sections telling you folks why this game is bad and I won't recommend it.\nIn case you don't believe me that I'm long time player, look for the name "Udonge".\n\nAir battle:Actually, it's somewhat kinda enjoyable. , but as far as I can tell, it has fewer people than before, maybe it's just me, not sure.\n\nGround battle:Rewriting the whole section for latest stuff.\nI feel it's getting worse, cheats exist after all, it ain't fun when the opponents can see you through the whole forest, also it's not fun when the RNG strikes. Your shot that should penetrate the enemy somehow bounced off while their shot that's almost parallel with your top of turret punch through the armor and kills the entire crew. It's just not fun to play.\nActually the bushes aren't that bad.\nOne thing that I think that will ruin gameplay: Anti tank missiles.\nNow where the hell's my M1 Abrams, or the M60A5 at least?\n\nEconomy and research and stuff like balancing:♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\nWhat a load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It still takes a lot of time to unlock stuff because the reward isn't enough for you to unlock high tier stuff. Tanks? It's already a endless grind at mid tier.\nAnd balancing? "♥♥♥♥ the balancing" said the Snail. The 5 rank with battle rating system clearly works better than the good ol' days of 20 rank system doesn't it? Have fun fighting things that more advance than yours.\n\nCommunity/Devs a.k.a. my favorite partSince I was permanent read only on the forums because of no reason at all, I rarely go there now.\nBut well, I mentioned something about cheats up there right?\nSo they finally admitted cheats actually exist. Guess what, I still remember they days when they denied all the claims of cheats and hacks.\nNow they admit cheats do exist after PhlyDaily's vid was shown. Guess what, devs started a poll to ask people what they should do. Results? "Strike any such videos, according to our license, and fight any advertisement (or "discussion") of illegal modifications in general, regardless of any "disclaimers" in a video." In other words, nothing about cheats and stuff can be discussed to "prevent promotion of cheats". How's that affect community?\nIf someone posted a vid about cheats on his Youtube channel, devs can strike on his channel even the guy is against cheats, and his channel is ruined because of Youtube's three strikes out policy, even the first strike can already screw up his channel as many abilities are restricted.\nAlso, mods don't change much, still the same NKVD. And constructive criticism section is still useless, devs don't listen to players anyway.\nConclusionNew conclusion:\nNot recommended if you're gonna play tank battles. Planes on the other hand, maybe, maybe you can give it a shot. And that's it, I won't be playing this again.","November 4, 2015","false","478.3"," 80 of 100 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","80","100","7","2"

It really was historically accurate with real plane statistics and I welcomed the WT as modernized IL-2 1946. However in the last few years this game went to ♥♥♥♥. Somehow russian planes have the best engines, best aerodynamics and weapons. While in reality these were one of the worst flying planes out there. Same goes for tanks. I mostly play US tanks and the fact that M36 can't penetrate T34 up front is just simply BS. Also the magical power of T34 grants you immortality since you can bounce off 128mm german shells that ripped this piece of technological disaster to pieces. No. Just no Gaijin. Stop it. You're killing your own game because some idiot in the management decided russia to be the best nation of WW2 while in reality it was one of the worst, looking both from political or technological view.\n\nThe change of matchmaking makes you go with US starter tank go against T34 1942 which is balanced af. Same goes for planes and everything in the game. Once they said that there won't be any prototypes, yet Germany and Russia got ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of prototypes including E-100 (Wasn't even fully constructed ever) and Maus. I don't really get why are devs sh**tingng into their own mouths with all this.\n\nAnother problem is the historical accuracy at all since US planes have weak engines, UK weapons are innefective and the glorious Russian planes have best stats at everything. The fact that russian vehicles overall had many problems, for example the transmittion on T34 lasted for 30-50km after being completely damaged. The fact that T34 goes for about 30km/h on a terrain is just simple BS. it couldn't go above 15 km/h in terrain due to crappy transmittion. And to shift to 4.th gear you would need some sort of superhuman power. The fact that every russian plane can catch up to US plane is BS aswell. Most of the russian planes had problems with weak engines followed by overheating. Just play some IL-2 1946 and you'll see what I'm talking about.\n\nIn overall, due to russian bias in first place, terrible matchmaking on the second place and the great responsivity of the devs I really don't reccomend this piece of WW2 russian biased BS.","May 13","false","796.0"," 77 of 98 people (79%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","79","77","98","8","9"

Now, when I first heard this, I was skeptical as there are whiners in every game. There is definitely some questionably statted russian tanks, but the problem to me is the matchmaking. The matchmaking is terrible, you are often matched against overtiered tanks that you have no hope of penning. I get that there are game balancing issues vs. historical accuracy, but when you are in your Tiger I or Panther staring down a Tiger 2 or some cold war russian behemoth with futuristic ammo, you literally can't destroy the other tank without some heroic flanking maneuvers.

I haz anti aircraft unit in battle? Me gonna wipe out entire enemy tank company with ma anti aicraft unit armed with a death ray.\n\n2. Description will be available soon.\n\n3. Random number chances in a game about realism? They got wot!?!?! A Tiger 1 Tank? Don't worry Comrade, chances are every shot that Tiger tank does (even at historically deadly ranges of up to 2000 yards) will deflect on my T34 tank even if it is a shot at the rear of said T34 tank.\n\n4. If you still want to play the game or are relatively new to the game avoid the hours when people who play this in a near religious zeal come out to play (they all seem to come from the one time zone and their tanks majority of which in tier 2 and 3 battles are the T34 tank, they are also pimped up, in fact each tank resembles a Communist parade float and not a freaking machine of war), you will quickly find out what I am talking about.\n\n5. A Soviet T34 tank can somehow survive a close proximity shot from a Stug III F variant+, you know the vehicle designed by the Axis during the war to provide close fire support to infantry that was also used primarily to knock out pill boxes and other entrenched positions, then later it was used as a tank destroyer in combined arms Panzer divisions.\n\n6. The Pz 38t Aus F is a tier 1 tank that is well protected and you would think "wtf is this talk about the Soviet tank bias?" but then you quickly find out as you advance in the tiers and unlock and play with new tanks that the majority of the German Panzer tanks have the exact same armor config as the Pz38T Aus F tank and in battles consisting of tier 2 tanks (yes the very next tier), 50 by 30 by 30 armor config is not going to protect you from instant death especially against Soviet tanks that for the majority of them have deadly HE (high explosive) ammunition, said ammo can kill your entire crew (and knock your tank out) if the shell hits (keep in mind historically the Soviets up until 1942 had many different types of ammo for their tanks and for the most part they were all ineffective against German armor, this changed with the introduction of the improved T34 which also led to the rise of the MBT concept).\n\n7. There is no penalty in tank battles when someone jumps into an aircraft and does a kamikazi run on you, considering that this act is a deliberate death in an attempt to knock your unit out, also the fact that in air battle gameplay modes the killing of your own team mates deducts end game credits really begs why such a similar act in tank battles is not further frowned upon (there is in the form of bonus credits an incentive to try and make your aircraft survive until the timer runs out but the incentive is too small for most people to even bother about it).\n\n8. Axis units progressively get worse in actual gameplay performance vs Allied nations units, an example is the paper thin armor on Japanese aircraft vs the nearly indestructible Soviet aircraft (same tier). "Son that aint a "heavy fighter" at all". Also see points 4 and 5.\n\n9. As a free 2 play game it is obvious that grinding will be included yet what does not make sense is that when you unlock a new tier of vehicles you cannot purchase (you can still research it, no problems there) a tank that you really wanted unless you have purchased the tank in the previous tier that preceded it, for example say you wanted the infamous Tiger 1 tank (tier 3) but don't like the look and bulky feel of the Panzer III M (tier 2), well bad luck then as you are forced to purchase the Panzer III M before you are allowed to purchase the Tiger 1 (the next tank in the chain).\n\n10. Victory day celebrations did not have discounts on German tanks.\n\n11. Not sure if hackers or just the weirdness of lag but sometimes you get shot at through solid rock (I have the replay to prove it).\n\n12. All the above could become moot if they would rework the matchmaking, since as it stands currently it is now only about matching similar tiers of tanks to each other, nothing is considered in regards to individual player skill (the game keeps track of your "service record" so why not go further and match players with like "service records"). The game will eventually (if not already) become unfriendly to new players.\n\n13. Not really the fault of the developer but base campers ruin the game, only willing to advance forward when more experienced players are willing to do the majority of the dirty work (this could also be made moot if the dev reworked the matchmaking (see point 12)).\n\n14. This is not a net issue as I have a fiber optic connection but sudden and massive drops in FPS from sub 60 to around the ~15 frames per second mark, this happens rarely but always at the most inconvenient rage inducing times.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn conclusion, the game is visually impressive it also has (at least early on in tier 1) that "one more game" feel however once you advance beyond tier 1 you quickly learn just how unbalanced the game is and how some included underlying mechanics and design decisions ruin the game, Keep in mind that I have been playing video games since the late Atari 2600 days and the first ever tank game that I played was 'Conqueror' by Ocean Software (a 1988 PC game designed for 286 computers with CGA/EGA or VGA monitors), War Thunder is very similar to that game in that it is also an external camera view 3D (but with real basic low poly 3D graphics) game, however it was single player only and I must say 'Conqueror' makes much more sense then this, since in 'Conqueror' a Kv1 tank going up against a Panther or Tiger tank is 9 out of 10 times going to get wasted while in this, it is more about is the random number generator in my favor and also is the damn Soviet tank equipped with HE rounds or not?\n\nEdit: Reworked for clarification some of the points listed in the review.","May 13","false","166.0"," 71 of 90 people (79%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","79","71","90","8","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fwb_Schultz/recommended/236390/","Fwb_Schultz","II./JG1_Schultz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fwb_Schultz/","67 products in account","The game is very fun if you ignore all historical value this game once promised. While in Closed beta the devs were very clear that the historical timelines would be the building blocks for this game. For example a very common aircraft like the 109 G6 or P51 would be more common because the repair cost and xp reward would be greater then aircraft that would be considered over powered for the year it flew. So in 1945 when 262 would be seen. The 262's cost of repair, ammo, and xp would give you no reward that would make it worth running it too much. Now the devs only see the money, not the historical value. If anyone opened a history book on the P63 and the P36 you'd see they had a habit to flat spin. I understand there is a Simulation mode, but that still doesn't adjust the year differences. An F6F has no buisness seeing HE112s! A late 1930s plane versus a mid 1940s plane.... I either will say the devs really just don't care about their older fans, or that most pilots of the US planes are so bad and complain so much that they need to be matched with planes from pre and early stages of the war. The Devs don't like the Japanese, they get a plane every 4 or 5 patches. The Russians are armed to the teeth with 1950s clubbing seals on 1945 German planes (execpt the Mig and F86)... Again my biggest gripe with this game is the Devs changing the one promise that made them stand out. For those who don't care about historical value you'll love this game. For those who are fanatacis about WWII aviation and armor you will be disappointed by the following(assuming you don't buy your way up the tree); Airforces (teir/nation) Russian:5 Japan:3 US:5 German:4 Britiain:4 ground forces German:4 Russian:5. I've played all the nations and grinded every tank and plane with out buying my way up the tree and with out using only premium planes. In WoT yeah I milked the Type 59 for every xp and credit it would let me take. Crap off topic, again not historical and will please the biggest spenders... the Americans and Russians.\n\nOh and the reason they keep the 262 at tier 5 with a battle rating to meet the F86s and Mig 15s.... it's 30s! The HE162 was hit with the nerf club, so grinding the German Mig 15 is impossible and will take a life time to grind with out the 130% gain from the HE162.\n\nIt's been said before and I will say it here. The other major killer of this game is the teams... I have been on some teams that just know what they are doing! They can aim, they know how to use altitude, BnZ, and stall fighting.... but that is rare 70% your team will be stuck on the deck killing AI and shooting AAA with a high altitude fighter.\n\nAlso high altitude fighters like the TA 152, FW 190Ds, P51s, ect never really see the best of thier abilities because the fights again never make it above 5km. The Yak fighters historally were great on the deck and at low altitudes. With out a doubt there!\n\nWoT vs WT ground forces.... at least WoT is less grindy. The one BIG plus to WT groundforces, none of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t lower plate weak ♥♥♥♥ for the German armor! More importantly when the US tanks are launched none of that weak hull crap either. The M103 was a beast in real life and I expect to see it tear IS4s and T54s apart. The KT 105 is less leathel then the KT in tier 4. Don't grind for German tier 5 it's not worth it. Get Tier 4..... if the grind doesn't kill you.\n\nWhen GF first came out the Simulator game mode was amazing! The experience was AMAZING! and the credits poured in! Then the Devs demanded more money and longer grinds and beat the crap out of GF. I literally made it to Tier 4 in about two days from the initial release of GF. Both Russian and German trees.... now... pffft I still am not close to getting my Tier 5 tank because it's too painful to play this arcade crap!","November 17, 2014","false","442.7"," 148 of 211 people (70%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","70","148","211","10","11"

I was going to make a very long winded explanation how this game's utter ♥♥♥♥ but I'm almost certain there's +300 more people that can do that better than me.\n\nGaijin prides itself on this game, touting it as a historically accurate representation of late '30s to mid '50s Tank and Aircraft combat. And they do make a good job of representing the vehicles as accurate as possible. But if you want actual, historical scenarios that took place, you are so ♥♥♥♥ed. The tier and BR systems pretty much spoil this game's "historical accuracy" by having planes and tanks be ranked about how powerful they are. So, late B-17s, B-24s, and Lancasters, instead of facing mid war Axis fighters, go up against late war props and even early jets simply because they'd be too over powering for aircraft they had historically faced. Or have King Tigers, a late World War Two tank, face Cold War Era Soviet, Brit, and American tanks because the devs just slap a BR on it and it gets mixed in with a BR that's slightly higher than that of the King Tiger's.\n\nAdd that to how little the devs actually listen to their following, do whatever the hell they want, and systematically SILENCE those who disagree with their decisions on the forums. When the Japanese flyers and community wanted the H8K flying boat to be added, the developers labeled it to be "possibly premium". When the update finally dropped, what do you know, the H8K became a premium aircraft because ♥♥♥♥ the fans, they made the game, they make the shots. For Christ's sakes, on the Dev server before the latest patch dropped, the P-61A was listed as an obtainable aircraft to all, no pay-to-fly or use. Then, at almost the last second before the update was put into effect, they decide to make the P-61A a premium aircraft. If those two scenarios ain't a huge middle finger to your fans, I don't know what is.\n\nOnce you look past all that, you can still have plenty of fun with this free but ultimately narcissitic ridden game that tries to make you cough up money so hard that they'll make the game a slow-as-hell ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ until you fork over your hard earned cash to make the act of getting new aircraft an exciting event and not something akin to being a chore.

They actively censor any discussion of their game that paints it in a negative light, even going so far as to create a poll asking forum members to choose between changing core mechanics of a game mode, or issuing copyright strikes against any video that discusses hacking in War Thunder.  Add to that their absurdly draconian chat rules and the e-thug moderators that gleefully ban anyone who has the nerve to disagree with them, and you have an environment that is extremely hostile to free speech.

If you do manage to get a plane, good luck affording it if you've been buying modifications for your existing planes, since you have to buy it after 'unlocking' it.\n\nThe game balance has been screwed over too.

I love WW2 themed simulator games. When i first joined up War thunder almost 3 years ago, it looked very promising. This was the first (♥♥♥ you Wowp) decent flight-sim/arcade that looked decent in a long time. War thunder is certainly a pleasure for the eye, worthy of the latest graphical standards set to date.\n\n\nProgression:\n\nDo you want to fly the most epic post war jets?\n\nDo you want to know what it is like to fly an me262, hunter of the late war skies?\n\nDo you want to drive those legendary king tigers and Pershings?\n\nWELL TOO BAD!! (or pay up)\n\nProgression is nonexistent. The grind is SO terrible that it if WW2 had Gajin mechanics we would still be flying biplanes to this day. The first tiers are okay i guess. But starting from mid tier 3 , things get grindy fast.  An average match in planes gets you about 1400 rp and with tanks even lower than that (excluding boosters). When you need to research this plane/tank you want and its 75k rp or more, you are about to pull your hair out. Things get worse as you progress, as you are grinding your way through 5464 of the same planes with almost no real difference between them. Really, do we need to have 20 types of bf109, 25 types of yak and 57 types of spitfire? god please. Yeeeyy i just grinded a 89k spit for 3 months only to find out that the stock version of that plane is ten times worse that your spaded spit you used to get it. THE STOCK GRIND IS ♥♥♥ WRECKING. You have to be a masochist to enjoy this. If you like wasting your time and effort, like playing for weeks/months for minimal reward, you will be thrilled by this game. Unless you pay...\nYes i do realize there is alot of difference between an bf109 F2 and a G2...\n\nBalancing:\n\nThe BR system was invented by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ platypus. You face plane/tanks that are + 1.3 - 1.3 compared to you. However, most of the time its + - 2.3...\nFor example: If I used a plane of BR 3.3, you are constantly matched by planes up to 5.3 or more. Happened 5 times this week alone. I suppose the gajin-lovers among  you think this is impossible and will whine to try to prove their point.The BR system is broken as f***. Unless you pay...\nBR distribution is foul as well. Certain german tanks/planes and japanese planes face things they should not.. which\nbrings us flawlessly to the next point.\n\nBias:\n\nGajin has said there is no bias countless times. However, there just is.\nTanks: The T34 and to extend the T34-85, is the single most OP tank in Gajin history, able to block shells from Tigers, Panthers and occasional King tiger. Deflection shells can happen of course, but when A T34-85 block 5 shells of a Tiger to the rear with no damage, uses his supersonic turret traverse speed to turn to you and one-shot you through the thickest part of your armor (NOT IN A WEAK SPOT) at a 30° angle, I just call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. KV's and Su's have this too, but not to the UBER-MOTHERLAND-PRIDELY way of the T34. Conclusion, don't play tanks unless you use a russian tank. Preferably a T34 or variants. If you really do have to play another nation, which isn't recommended for your mental sanity, use 50 - 60 ducks premium pay wall tanks of the Germans or Americans.\n\nPlanes: Not as bad as the bias in tanks. The real problem with planes (RB) is the over-preforming UFO's like the I185. Also the big spread on the BR causes poor lower tier germans to face higher Pay to win russian premium P63 noobs.\n\nPro's: - Swordfish\n- Exit button\n- AFK climbing\n- Low intelligence level players, being easily offended or fooled.\n- 1 byte/sec download speed gives you time to do the chores of the house\n\nCONCLUSION: I would write down a lot more, but please refer to Crabman's review for additional information.\n\nOnly three ways to fully enjoy this game:\n\n- be a pro russian rebel, with a secret shrine to Gajin and Stalin in his cellar, while doing ritual sacrifice    on innocent germans. Preferably well spoken, as you need to carry out Gajin's orders on how to mute the critics of this game. Be prepared to crush the dreams of others. One day, Gajin might send you a hair of Stalins moustache as a reward.\n\n- Be a millionaire and spend over 500 bucks on this game to get every single premium plane, soviets preferred, and buy 10 years of premium time.\n\n- be mentally unstable, and enjoy to cause pain to yourself and are ready to face depression.\n","May 23","false","1.2"," 58 of 72 people (81%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","81","58","72","10","7"

I suspect powercreep.\n- Stock planes to "upgraded" planes have a huge performence delta making the level grind painful and hard.\n- There has been a lot of "remove content to make it pay2get/unlock with grind", skins, decals, unlocks etc.\n- Bombers are having a hard time getting properly balanced, in low tier they are Bullet Sponges while they die like ♥♥♥♥ in Mid/High tier games.\n- If you put 5 Nations into the game support them all equally or don't bother adding them in the first place .\n- Power of Stalinwood and Leninium - If you know what I mean. (This is pretty open to debate though and it's not the case with every plane)\n- The whole Jet/High tier stuff seems fairly unfinished right now in terms of content and balance.\n\nIf you want a real "simulator" that is equal to RL don't bother, sim battles is a nice mode but it still lacks realism and complexity. I recommend IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad for WW2 sim nuts and DCS (modular free2play too) world if you want to play with modern Jets.\n\nIf you want some "quick" action without a huge learning curve, realism and arcade mode should be good modes for you.\n\nTL;DR\nI don't recommend buying anything for this game atm due to the amount of big changes especially to premium content but it is worth getting to have some fun :)","December 17, 2013","true","86.7"," 546 of 853 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","546","853","0","16"

I think this was around version 1.21\nThe game was extremely fun. Ofcourse, since it was Beta it contained a lot of bugs and imbalanced planes (it was only planes back then), some of which were fixed within the week or month, others that are still not fixed today. But all was okay and the community was very relaxed so to speak.\n\nNow you got to understand one thing, War Thunder at the time had around 20 tiers, that was perfectly balanced for every plane out there and matchmaking could very much handle it the way it should but all of a sudden within a few patches they changed the Tier 20 system to a ridiculous Tier 5 system, a system that even up till today takes way more hours of grinding to get the next plane than it was ever before. Now that they hightened the grinding levels was understandable in a way because some people could grind to the latest Tiers within a few days/weeks, so they had to level it out for the whole game and paid players.\n\nBut oh boy, that is also where the poo hitted the fan, because their matchmaking system, which used to be somewhat flawless now was utter crap that used "BR ratings" to set you up with others and even up till today people find ways to abuse this system and get with extremely good vehicles in games agains people with extremely bad vehicles. It just doesnt make any sense.\n\nOh yeah and up untill today, they still have not fixed a lot of bugs. One of which that is very bad for a game like this, hit detection. If you fire up to 20 bullets from a plane, the connection can make it so that you only hit the other plane with 5 or 10 of them, while on your screen it can look like you hitted it with 15 or even all 20 bullets.\n\nPlease stay clear of this game, but if you really want to play it, do not give/pay any money untill they do something about all the bad things.","May 22","false","277.3"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","39","43","0","3"

I started playing when tanks didnt exist and planes were only feature of this game. It was fun, we had 20 tier system, no stupid BR system, yes German planes were OP in that time, but havent met them every battle. Game was balanced except German planes were overperforming as i wrote. Then came BR system which worked in first few monts even in CBT of Tanks, but then when tanks came out strange things started to happen, but it wasnt that bad as its now. In first year the russian tanks was heavily underpower. Then came patch that make game playable on both sides for nearly half of the year. US tanks beta was full of new things, mainly US tanks offcourse, Shermans were amazing, they wasnt OP as many players cried because they aimed for turret and not for hull.\n\nFALL OF THE GAME\nAnd now begins my critic: Gaijin nerfed US 76 mm and 90 cannons to ground, WTF is that you cant kill Panther to hull with 90 mm APBC? Russian tanks began to be massively overperfoming only in cannons, and not in armor, you could kill them easily. And now am I in year 2015 and MASSIVELY STUPID APCR NERF AND SCLOPED ARMOR BUFF. After this STUPID PATCH soviet tanks began to be massively OP in arnament and bull..... armor. T34 once bounced my KWK 36 APCR, really? I dont need to write about useless British tanks, their repair cost and their useless ammo. And i cant forget about MASSIVELY TOXIC COMMUNITY ON FORUMS, which are brainwashed and they dont take any arguments, even if there are true. I got ban by nearly nazi moderator because i very bravely saying true about the game.\nI understand that Gaijin cant make everybody happy, but clearly Russian Bias is stupid, it seems like Gaijin has Putin´s pistol near head and they cant nerf russian tanks. Gaijin is trying to make players happy by making premium tanks, thats STUPID and it will make many players to leave, not to come.\n\nCONCLUSION\nDont start to play this game, its NOT WORTH IT in its currect state, maybe it will be fun in first tier, but you will very fast see how is game broken.","February 2","false","789.7"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","35","39","4","4"

Had a match in Berlin, spawned north side. Thought I'd flank around wide in my M18 Hellcat, sticking to the back roads for the time being. Ideal conditions for the thing. Oh, they've hit my speed again, welp. Pan camera around checking for any enemies, it's realistic and I'm pretty far forward, don't want any surprises in my glorified armored car. Why... is an Allied T-34-85 able to keep up with me while I'm going full tilt on a long stretch of road. In an M18. Seems legit and in no way pants on head.\n\nThe average thought processes behind someone who actually loves tanks and did their homework:\n\nWar Thunder 'Realistic Mode'. Where we took out the Russian ammo's inaccuracy, nerfed American mobility and gun depression, didn't bother fixing their ammo to behave like it's real world counterpart, still haven't nerfed Russian HE ammo hitting up to 2 tiers higher than it's supposed to. Still haven't modeled German armor correctly to represent how weird the Tiger's front armor was, cool. Still haven't fixed American APHE actually not having HE filler, awesome. Oh and the German round velocity still blows, check check. Oh they hit the American mobility yet again, still haven't fixed their armor. And now their biggest strength, air power has to deal with Assault Fuses. On a plane you wouldn't bother dive bombing in. Secret documents showing this is how the real war went? Huh, that's interesting. Why doesn't the T34's engine explode as often and why does it take multiple HE direct hits to track tanks? Well.. alright we'll roll with that. Huh, that crew hatch deflected an AP shell at 70 meters, that's new...\n\ntl;dr - World of Tanks more accurately modeled the guns in their arcade game than Gaijin did in Realistic.

However after a year and a half of gameplay from their original launcher (2009-1010) i began to notice a trend of "small" patches, which seemed unusual, but i pushed them aside.... I switched over to Steam to track how long i played the game (downloaded it from here about 2 years ago), and i've noticed my times on the game per day have been steadily decreasing from the lack of ability to deal with the crap they continue to shovel down our throat as players.\n\nPro-... no, i'm not going to bother with this. There are no pros anymore.\n\nThe first thing i can't stand is their way of "sales"... i'm sorry, i bought the Ace pack when it was 39.99  (flat, no sale) and then they INCREASED the base price 3 weeks later to do a 40% sale, so now instead of it being 40 bucks it's 50 without a sale. That's NOT a sale, that's inflation. I'm sorry but you don't Con your players like that. That's flat out rude no matter what your explination is to doing it.\n\nSecond, the nation bias is absolutely appalling! I've NEVER heard of biplanes carrying late-war era Shvak cannons all because "They'd be underpowered against the other nations" yet you have the audacity to nerf bomber strength (armor and gun accuracy/gunner count and this is being linked to all of them not just one before you proclaim i'm saying something out of context) for the Wellington, Mitchell, Flying Fortress and the Super Fortress, give the Ishaks and Yaks insane handling ability and ramming survival and make the early-game completely lopsided to the russian airforce! Which, mind you, was KNOWN for having several crippling errors such as weak frames, crap peashooters that broke down at the slightest jerking of the aerilons and were known to stall at low altitudes due to how the fuel intake was situated within the frame.\n\nThirdly: The german and american tanks were instantly smashed for their armor ratings both realistic and arcade (arcade is understandable), while the Russians get armored MBT'S from the late stages of the 60's into the early stages of the 90's!? (T-54 models) You're literally making this game so difficult to grind other vehicles that you're pushing people TOWARDS other games.\n\nFourth: speaking of 1960-1990, now you're bringing in new planes which is awesome, however, the planes your bringing in have nothing to do with the era of planes from the other nations. If you're so intent on bringing in RUSSIAN early 20th century jets, where the hell is the 1990's prototype Warthog attacker for the American side? Instead what do we see? Some snazzy one-shot P-51 remakes and a twin fuselage german prop plane that is a flying matchbox. GG gaijin.\n\nFifth, and most important: Your communication with the public is TERRIBLE. You speak like you own the world, then toss us, your customers and players, aside to support the kiddies who have their parents' credit cards while many of us put forward suggestions that can support the growth of this game as a whole. (such as support for using ALL your tanks in arcade, the removal of planes in arcade tank battles which would make spawn killing less detrimental and the increase of tank map size so that people aren't able to shoot from one spawn to the other for an instant kill. This is just Arcade issues.\n\nI can go into much worse conversation about the hell of the "magic armor" of the T-34 in realistic battles surviving multiple BLACK impact shots from Tigers and Tiger II's of various models (8,8, 10,5, 7,5, 105mm derp on the M4, short 8,8 on the PZ IV and so forth) yet they're able to pen the top front plate of practically all tanks it faces and igniting a fire or ammo rack when it turns YELLOW, leaving you completely wrecked compared to a tank that in historical records *struggled for months* against those tanks when facing headon due to their out dated ammo types and low velocity guns.\n\nYour chat mods are also extremely one-sided. They let slip the slander upon America involving russian chatter but the MOMENT someone speaks ill of Russia they get chat banned! The moment they complain about the russian tech being biased, or the moment they are approached with fixes to failed coding that didn't get updated in nearly 7 years, REAL CODERS TRYING TO HELP YOU! They ban them! like they're the plague!\n\nYou don't read tickets with thoughtful support, and if you do you only nit-pick problems that are given to you so you can blame the customer's computer (no matter how fancy it may or may not be) And if the computer checks out you blame the internet provider! YOU REFUSE TO ACCEPT ANY BROKEN FORM OF YOUR GAME EXISTISTING.\n\n\nBut i digress, You intentions are clear, you're not here for your customers, you're not here for your players. you're here for Russia. And for the ability to slander ALL countries out-right to give you that "we reign supreme" nationalistic pride that you would no doubt rip into ANY company not associated with russian communication/historical "records" (and have on Armored Warfare already from the look of their forums when i see russian chatter on there and in-game)\n\nIn otherwords? I HIGHLY SUGGEST to all new players thinking of this game, AVOID IT AT ALL COST. The only reason i even look at this game once every 4-5 weeks is because i spent money on this game i refuse to let go without being used  to the best of my ability. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS GAME IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOUR SANITY.","March 4","false","313.9"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","39","47","6","5"

You will meet Tanks more than 10 Years more Modern than your own in some Cases. And in many Cases you will be met With Enemies you simply cannot Defeat. Worse as some Parts of the Matchmaking are thus not Played. You will either have to Grind around them. Or will constantly Play as an sole Lower Tiered Tank in an very High Tiered Match.\nThe Last and most Persistent Problem in the Game is the Incompetence of the Mission/Map Creators. Which are placing Objectives right next to the Respawn. And Practically Force People into Spawncamping. Which Results in Enemies Spawning onto you while Capturing the Enemy Base. Or People Sitting nicely Hidden 300m behind your Spawn and Killing you without you having any Chance to Fight Back.\nThe by Far Worst Problem however. Is and Stays the Abuse of Low Quality Graphics.\nEspecially in the Realistic Game Modes. There is no Extra Markers on Enemy Ground Forces. This causes an very heavy Interference for Players with High Graphic Quality because they see alot more Bushes, Trees, Grass and Objects than Players with a Low Graphic Setting which thanks to this will see Tanks much easier especially in Cities Forested Areas.\n\n\n\n\nRight now my Judgement on this Game (Pls note the Date of this Review as things might change for better or for worse in the Future)\nis that\n\nAir Forces AB is Fairly Playable and Enjoyable given you want Fast Action.\nAir Forces RB is Very Good with Minor Problems.\nAir Forces SB is Nice in General but its nothing for True Simulation Players.\n\nGround Forces AB I got no Idea as I never really Played it\nGround Forces RB Is currently outright Unplayable thanks to the Incompetence and Stubborness of the Devs.\nGround Forces SB is Fairly Playable but very Limited as you cannot choose which Tanks you want to Play.\n\n\n\nSo I as an Ground Forces Player will not Recommend the Game.\nIf your more into Air Forces I suggest you take a look at it tough :)\nWell in the End you need to Check for yourself anyways. And its Free so Give it a Try.\nJust Expect to be Frustrated alot on stuff if your getting into it some Further.","January 21","false","810.0"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","31","36","2","1"

How you have gone astray.  Initially it seemed like quite a nice combat flight simulator, with the revolution that mouse could be used.  As time went on the game devolved into a series of longstanding issues that have not been resolved:\n\n1.  The Developers come from a Russian world view.  The map structure, is centered around a Close Air Support (CAS) concept; strategic bombers have markably pitiable splash radii.  Consequently, the majority of USAAF combat takes place at a low altitude where B-17 and B-24 strafe AAA and pillboxes with their .50 cals.\n2.  Variety for the sake of variation is pointless.  The developers are very keen on adding new planes to the game, some with no differences (Spitfire Mk 22, 24 have the same FM).  The Flight Models are invariably a placeholder (OP/UP) upon a new plane's introduction which borks balance.  Gaijin has a goal of adding more planes, but fails to balance them due to misuse of statistics in determining Battle Rating.\n3.  Realistic Battles and Simulator are the red-haired stepchild.  If you want a realistic flight simulator, look to IL-2 BoS.  Of late Gaijin has ignored the misuse of Bombers' mouse aim gunners in the mode of Simulator where joystick is all fighters can use.  Attempts by the community to redress this have been suppressed by Gaijin.\n4.  Gaijin is a very Russian company.  Their relation with the English speaking community is lacking.  Most famously a developer remarked the Me 262 was doing fine fighting F-86 Sabres because it was "feeling itself at its Battle Rating".  Attempts by the community to curb the bomber spam in Simulator Battle have been met with denial and suppression.  Gaijin is markedly loathe to admit a mistake on its part (reliance upon an unofficial TAIC is used to balance the N1K Shiden Kai) and forum threads are frequently locked upon criticism.","August 19, 2014","false","506.9"," 52 of 73 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","52","73","0","0"

Since then the Game gradually went downhill. The Introduction of an excruciating, unnessecary Vehicle/Module Grind (especially at High Era Vehicles) and the outright broken Battle Rating System. Combined with the sheer amount of broken Features and the dismissal behaviour of Gaijin to Community Feedback, in addition to their Soviet-/Cold War Mentality made me stop Playing the Game a long Time ago.\n\nThe Grind\nBarely noticeable at low Level Vehicles it will soon begin to get ridiciulous at Mid to High Era Planes where some unlockable Modules will cost more RP than most of the Era 3-4 Planes.\nStarting with Patch 1.31, Gaijin continiously reduced the Credit/RP income which forces you at some point to buy a Premium Account and/or overpriced Premium Vehicles.\n\nBtw: Don´t bother to convert your Free RP via Gold as the Conversion Rate isn´t worth your Money (1:45 Ratio)\n\nBattle Ratings\nThe Battle Rating System was originally designed to replace the Static 20-Tier System but made the Gameplay with every new major Patch procedural worse as more and more Vehicles are compressing the BR Brackets, resulting in Mid-WW2 Planes sealclubbing Pre-WW2 Biplanes or Korean War Jets clubbing late WW2 Prop Planes. Since its introduction Gaijin claims that the BR System is working as designed which simply isn´t true.\n\nGaijin\nGaijin went from an open, transparent Company to ignorant, nationalistic Bigots who don´t give a damn about their European/American Playerbase, effectively shielded by their Forum Mods/Community Managers from any constructive Criticism and have an openly sycophancy attitude towards Gaijin. Many of those Mods often resort to trolling and outright abusing their Powers against regular Players. Even Youtuber/Streamer are affected.\n\nHistorical Accuracy and Balance\nTo give them Credit, Gaijin manages to recreate Aircraft/Tank Models with great Details but that´s it. On multiple occasions many Tanks and Planes were "corrected" via "Secret Documents" from unverified Russian/Soviet Sources and were thus stripped from certain Equipment Modules and/or recieved inferior Performance Characteristics compared to their Real-World Counterparts. Most of these were applied to Non-Russian Vehicles. At the same time, many Russian Vehicles recieved considerable buffs (the Best example being Post-War Ammunition added to T-34/T-44/IS-2 Tanks).\n\nThis Russian Bias - which is constantly being denied by Gaijin - killed the Game for many of the Players.\n\n\n\ntl;dr - I can´t recommend this Game anymore","May 28","false","895.7"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","3"

I'm no longer a regular player like I used to be, I only come back whenever there are major content patches to see if Gaijin finally pulled their heads out of their you-know-where and started listening to their playerbase.

After the first day matches are extremely unbalanced. You'll take your tier 1 tanks or maybe your first tier 2 tank into battle excited for combat, only to realize you're facing late tier 2 or maybe even tier 3 tanks that you can't damage at all!\n\nWhy is this happening? Because the devs have decided to impliment this incredible "battle rating" system without telling anyone it was coming or even explaining why it was needed.\n\nYou know that old saying if it's not broken don't fix it? Derp!\n\nSo how this works is it takes your top three tanks in your load out, does some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ math with them, then poops out your battle rating. This is supposed to help in matching you to people with a similar ranked load out, but it doesn't work at all!\n\nThat's right, Gaijin has put this system into works and it does the EXACT OPPOSITE of what it was intended.\n\nSo I did a little research to find out what this battle rating garbage is all about.\n\nOverall BR = A/2+B/4+C/4\nOverall BR = (6.0 / 2) + (5.7 / 4) + (5.4 / 4) = 5.775\n\nThen it rounds your value UP to the next bracket.\n\nThat's from the wiki page.\nhttp://wiki.warthunder.com/index.php?title=Battle_ratings\n\nHowever when you actually get into a game and look at the player's ratings, you'll notice that you're is maybe a 2.7 with a few 2.3.. But then look over at the other team and it's 4.7, 3.7, 3.7 for their entire team, save maybe one or two.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nTier 1 units are typically between 1.0-2.0 BR\nTier 2 are 2.3-3.7\nTier 3 3.7-4+\n\nThere are a few exceptions but generally that's how it works. So when you look at your BR with everything 2.3 or less, then the enemy BR is all 4.0+ you are not going to win, period!\n\nMany variations of turn speeds, fire rates, ammo types available, penetration on ammo, armor,  ect goes into the different tiers. So when you have a tier 1 tank fighting a late-tier 2 tank or even a tier 3, your armor penetration on ammo simply isn't high enough to deal any real damage. Your only hope is to use extremely high penetration ammo (which still most likely will bounce off) and pray you hit something vital.\n\nHowever, here is the fun part, the high tier enemies don't need to worry about aiming or using good ammo to wipe you out quickly. It's point-click-dead for you. In air battles, they will turn faster, fly faster, have more ammunition, shoot faster, do everything possible better than you.\n\nYou may be able to get lucky and find someone as out-matched as you are and kill them before a high tier wipes your face in the dirt giggling, but typically you will be obliterated within seconds of spawning.\n\nThis wouldn't be so bad if it didn't have such a wide range of tiers it places into every battle. For example, some of the final tier 1 tanks can compete with tier 2 tanks.. Not all of them can but some can. However, they can't do much of anything against a tier 3 tank. Even if you are the most elite pro sniper you are still at a massive disadvantage because you must use pin point accuracy to inflict any damage at all, then the damage is very minor. All your enemy has to do it hit you anywhere at all with basic ammunition and you're done in one hit.\n\nThis is by far the worst aspect of this game and completely ruins the multiplayer PVP aspect. Other than this the game is fantastic and I would recommend it. Maybe you'll be lucky enough to never see one of this awful matches. But there is no way I can give this game a thumbs up when it allows vets to prey on complete noobs. (Yes you can be in the starter tank and fight T2-T3 tanks every single match, that happens a lot)\n\nBut then there's also the spawn camping. Oh yes! This game is also 50% spawn camping. Most maps are designed so that the teams can instantly begin shooting at each other from spawn, or only have to move a little bit to fire directly into enemy spawn points. A lot of the maps have hills off to the sides that tanks can perch on then snipe everything in the map with ease, once these hills are taken it's impossible to compete. The horrible part about this is usually one team spawns on or right beside one of these incredible tactical positions and begins dominating your team in spawn or just out of spawn soon after the match begins. There is nothing more disappointing then spawning 3 times only to be killed instantly without even being able to fire a single shot. This game has zero spawn protection and in most cases players rush to get into the easier spawn camping spots, then it's game over.\n\nUntil this is fixed I'd say don't waste time on this game. Many of it's players are quitting and going to other games because of Gaijin's horrible decision making and failure to listen to it's players.\n\nOn top of all that the community doesn't do much to help out new people and is infact encouraged to prey on them. You'll notice during your first few matches how some of the enemy team are level 20 generals running around in noob tanks with maxed out crews (Its easy for them to rack up kills and get huge points for doing it!). If you're lucky to avoid that, then once you get your first few tanks you will most definitely realize the unbalance of this game's match making. Try your best to get those high tier tanks/planes but you will -always- be pitched against higher level tanks/planes and players without any mercy.","March 30, 2015","false","49.6"," 40 of 53 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","40","53","2","1"

"Enduring Conflict". This is a fantastic gamemode that needs to be about on a permanent basis. The match is pretty much 6 hours on a drop in drop out basis. They need to fix the rewarding however as if you do not stay until the end of the match you will not get your rewards, they also need to add a few more objectives but overall it's perfect. You get to respawn as many times as you like in RB or SB and keep flying out your favourite planes from battle rating 2.3 to 4.3 (there are other barackets too). I feel for once gaijiggles have pulled out a golden egg and I cant wait to see it hatch, fingers crossed it's not rotten and it tuns into something grand.\n\n\n\nWarThunder is a little hit and miss for me, there is no doubt that this is the best game out there for it's genre, but whilst there is nothing to match it the game is plagued with problems within staffing and general game development.\n\n\nRecently the game has been on a decline, from what has been fun is now just beyond a joke. The development team continue to nerf aircraft such as the Mosquito, an aircraft iconic during 1941-1942 for it's excessive speed and maneuverability, it was given the nickname "the wooden wonder". However this game doesn't reflect this at all, the aircraft used to fly great however it has been nerfed to the ground so much that it's slow and does not maneuver very well compared to it's historical counterpart, in fact it has been nerfed to the point where the early planes it was built to outrun and outpace can catch it fairly easily, it faces late war prop planes which far exceed the Mosquitos capabilities. This is but one of many planes that have seen nerfs, the fabled Griffon Spitfire? Nerfed, engine HP is greatly reduced, 150 octane fuel removed. F8F Bearcats? Nerfed, Ta-152 and various other german planes? Nerfed, Japanese planes? Nerfed. Russian planes? Buffed.\nDon't get me wrong, the gameplay is great but the balancing is terrible.\n\n\n\nNow the official forums are just a complete and utter **** show. Overly power hungry/mad community moderators and admins handing out bans and warnings to players talking about issues in game, broken planes or any other issues regarding the games development, they will make snide remarks and as soon as you make a retort they will come down on you and claim that you're causing a flame war when anything you say is far from it.\n\n\nI would like to reccomend this game, but the games is beingg ran into the ground by a poor development team and a corrupt band of misfits patrolling the official forums taking away peoples freedom of speech. Slowly but surely Gaijiggles is becoming an Authoritarian company, or maybe it already is.","July 5, 2015","false","363.1"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","37","49","4","3"

They have for a long, long time had very strange ideas especially when it comes to balancing the game. Their system for the relative matchmaking between vehicles (their "Battle Rating") is only initially based on expected performance, and is then ONLY based on player statistics. If players do bad in a plane it means the plane is bad and should get lower BR to get easier opponents, with absolutely zero investigation into WHY the plane does bad.\n\nCouple that with strange ideas like low graphics quality completely removing some graphical entities from tank battles (like some types of bushes) and the CEO effectively insulting anyone that thinks it is a bad system to not make the world representation at least have the same objects rendered in different quality of graphics and you are in for a fun time.\n\nTheir interaction with the community is basically to tell us to give feedback, and then completely ignoring absolutely everything that's said. At the odd occasion that they don't completely ignore it they just completely misinterpret it and destroy the game that way instead.\n\nIt is tragic that the above happens, because the game's ENGINE is excellent, and the game has an enormous potential, but the management at Gaijin is so incompetent that calling them "monkeys" is an insult to actual monkeys worldwide.\n\nGaijin doesn't treat this as a game. They are simply milking it on money for all they're worth, and seem to treat it more as a test-bed for developing a game engine. How fun the game is is completely irrelevant as the code works on a technical level.\n\nThere is no question about if they'll ever get the game on its feet. The only question is "How long can you put up with the growing mountain of ♥♥♥♥ before you leave?"","September 26, 2015","false","510.9"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","27","32","0","0"

I say that as someone who's played for what is honestly years now, starting all the way back in 1.27. Has the game worn on me a little? Most likely, but what I think has happened is Gaijin saw money and got greedy.\n\nProgression is my main complaint. The progression way back when I started playing was nice. You'd play for a week and unlock a plane or two and you'd have something new to play with. With patch 1.37 they changed the entire progression model, claiming you'd be able to get down the line faster than ever. That was a lie. Now you could play an entire month and would maybe unlock a single aircraft.\n\nThen it got worse. Gaijin slowly reduced the experience you recieved from your aircraft, upped the experience cost of everything, and charged more for premium vehicles. With every major update, they would put more obstacles in the form of more vehicles, some barely historic. Normally, a game that adds content like that would be great, but when it's used to extend the grind to later tiers it becomes a chore. The progression is a joke now. If you were to start today, you might see a jet in about 18 months. That's a long time to dedicate to what feels like a rapidly declining game.\n\nOverall though, the gameplay is still reasonable. For the most part, aircraft fly and fall apart convincingly, and tanks feel properly heavy like they should. It's got a solid core game. The biggest issue is the actual grind, and when a game starts to feel like work is really when you should drop it. Would I pay any more of my hard-earned money to these developers? Probably not, and if I do that time is a long ways away when the game undergoes radical changes. Would I recommend this game? In it's current state, absolutely not.","August 21, 2015","false","264.1"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","31","39","0","1"

I finally came into conclusion:\nWarThunder is free to play. As in, it is free to roam around the map, and be cannon fodder for overpowered russian biased players (even more if they're paying for premium or premium vehicles). You can drive around in a nice model of Tiger 1 which was no match for any other tank for a good few years, and used to anninhilate every russian t32, in this game this won't be it. You will get upranked and will have to fight ridiculously overpowered (cannon wise, shell wise, movement wise) soviet vehicles. Tbh, even high explosive charges feel to do a lot more damage once you fight for the russians... I'm no expert, but afaik Gaijin is a russian company, hence the bias...\nDon't get me wrong, I'm far from being bad at this game, I camp around, play the Tiger tactically, get my several kills most of the time, but it is a struggle. Gaining wins in Ralistic Battle? Yeah, right. 1/20 is a win.\nIn Sim battles, it's better, but there aren't that many battles for Tiger1 in sim.\nAnd don't even get me started on planes...\nDid I mention scores of russian speaking players? Not having anything against, but most of the communication is done in russian without asking...\nWhat elsee... ooh, lots of spawn camping. You spawn in, bam, right into the back. It seems fair to Gaijin. Cause, you know, russian tanks are fast and nimble, by the time Tigers get to objective, theyre already at our spawn, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ everyone as soon as you spawn in.\nSo if you think you enjoy being shot in ridiculous OP affected ways most of the time - this game is for you.

The engine is amazing. Great graphics and solid performance, even on weaker systems. The variety of tanks and aircraft is unmatched, and the 3 distinct gamemodes are all varied enough to be entertaining. What Gaijin consistently fails to understand, however, is their playerbase.\n\nI'm not even going to go into the whole "Russian bias" argument, just know that there are compelling arguments proving  it. Even if all the overperforming vehicles were British or American or Polish or whatever, the sheer amount of denial and refusal to address overperfoming vehicles, or mis-tiered ones is laughable. We have World War II era jets like the Ho 229 and the P80 facing off against cold war era ones like the Mig 17 and F 86 Sabre. Late war tanks like the Panther II VS some of the best post war tanks like the T-54 or T-10. The Yak 3P is currently much better than what's tiered against it, as is the I-185, a plane prototype that killed both it's test pilots and was cancelled.\n\nThe grind is also unreal. Someone calculated that, without premium, and with a pretty good 2.5 k/d, it would take a person roughly 2000 hours to grind out a top tier vehicle's modules. Not a vehicle, just to unlock every unlockable module on a vehicle. That's roughly a year of grinding if you played 166 hours a month. That's insane. This kills the playerbase at the top tiers, which is causing all sorts of problems with the matchmaker as tanks are drawn up from the lower tiers to fill these games.\n\nSo, overall, I still hold out hope that Gaijin will fix this game. They have the power to make this the best game of it's type on the market, bar none. But for now, stay well away before you get invested in a sinking ship.\n\nEDIT: So, this just happened: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxQqhkoq9k\n\nFor those of you who don't want to watch the video, here's the rundown. Illegal modifications for War Thunder have begun to circulate, and multiple Youtube channels who make War Thunder videos covered these mods. Chief among which was a mod that put vehicle markers above enemy tanks in the RB battle mode, effectively giving the player accurate information about enemy location that would not be available to him otherwise.\n\nGaijin then put a poll on their official forums, asking for player feedback on one of 2 options.\n\nOption 1 gave Gaijin a blank check to copyright strike videos covering these illegal mods, effectively censoring their own community with unlawful copyright strikes (Yes, these would be unlawful, as critique of copyrighted material is covered under fair use)\n\nOption 2 just put those overhead markers on enemy tanks in RB for all players, "Making the illegal modification useless", and also ruining the gamemode of choice for a significant portion of the playerbase.\n\nThis is ♥♥♥♥ing disgraceful, and even I doubted Gaijin would stoop so low. What they are doing is giving their own community, the dedicated players who keep interest in the game alive, an ultimatum. Stop covering these illegal modifications, or we will ruin the gamemode that you like. Keep in mind, they aren't even attempting to fix the exploit that allows this mod to work, no, they just want to bury it so that no-one can complain about it.\n\nThis is truely disgusting behavior. They are admitting to the entire playerbase that they are more willing to issue unlawful copyright strikes, potentially destroying entire Youtube channels dedicated to making content about War Thunder and putting Youtubers out of business entirely, than address an actual problem with their game. This is not how you make a good game, and this is not how to reward those who create free publicity about your game.\n\nThey have since backed down, and deleted the poll, but the issue remains. They were completely happy to do this in the first place. They saw no issue with threatening their own community with mass censorship, rather than deal with an actual problem in their own game. I'm calling it now. Gaijin will never save this game.","February 18","false","734.2"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","20","21","4","3"

I'll be discussing the flying portion as I have the most experience with it.\n\nThe primary issue here is that the devs are Russian, and like all Russian devs who make WWII games the commie propaganda shines through heavily and the Russian bias is extremely tangible, either due to national pride clouding the devs' honesty or them being force fed Red Army propaganda as children.\n\nThe key to having fun in this game is extremely simple: ignore Russians entirely. Don't play maps that pit you against Russians, and you'll have few complaints. The other factions balance well against each other, but compared to the flying saucer-tier unrealistic flight models of the Soviet Air Force(whose real life achievements include the worst kill-death ratio in World War II, the most plane crashes in the war, and probably the most pilots flying under the influence of alcohol), you'll find yourself raging out due to blatant imbalancing to favor Russian players and Russian planes(like pitting post-war Russian aircraft models against early/pre war German/Japanese/British/American ones, which is extremely prevalent in the first three tiers but consistent throughout the Russian aircraft tree). A good way to test the insane imbalance is by starting the game as a non-Russian faction, and then picking up the Russian tree after you've learned the ropes to experience maximum seal clubbing as you can climb sharper, dive faster and turn quicker than anything else in the game.\n\nThe secondary issue is that these devs have added many types and classes of aircraft to the game, and any that aren't fighters or interceptors(70% of the aircraft models in this game) don't serve a purpose or benefit their team in any way. Bombers/ground attackers/fighters that focus on ground targets are nothing but a liability to/drag on their team and dog chow for opposing fighter aircraft. They do not serve a purpose in game modes that end 95% of the time in team wipes, even though there are ostensibly mission objectives for bombers to complete that almost never get done.\n\nFlying anything that isn't an air superiority fighter is choosing to play 'Getting Shot Down Simulator WW2'. Fighting Russians in anything that isn't Russian(with few exceptions) is also playing 'Getting Shot Down Simulator WW2'.\n\nThe Russian bias, wonky flight models/characteristics and horribly imbalanced game modes bring my score for this game from a solid 7/10 to a 5/10. As it basically still in 'active beta' release, I cannot recommend it until it is more polished and the devs learn English well enough to read their forums.

What 1.37 added was different way of proggression from the much more simple 1-20 tier system with 20 being top and 1 being the start it was compressed into only 5 tiers, what was expected was rough boundries eg Tier 4 vs Tier 4 well nope... If you play tier four your more than likely to experiance the wrath of a MiG-15 pilot booming and zooming your spawn throughout the whole game, still not the worst part thought, both Arcade and realistic are now flooded with bomber pilots flying to the enemy base blowing it up and letting the AI gunners act as laser guided heat seeking laser beams that track and destroy all life, this is still not to mention the horrible progression system that in a whole translates to "Give me all your money if you want to be good" the game requires countless grinds through horrible and buggy (Not to mention unbalanced) aircraft and then it makes you pay for it as it takes months to progress to a higher tier without a premiuim account or buy paying to progress. All this to unlock a slightly less broken aircraft just infront of it (Which comes stock so it's probably worse) The game went downhill from 1.37 flight models are now copies and objects not fully registered meaning you can fly through houses or you'll slam into an invisible 50ft tree.

Hell, I saw this train wreck 2-3 years ago and stuck for it for a year past the point of "I don't like where this is going," before I stopped playing more and more, finally stopping outright at the ~2.5 year mark.\nAll the while I tried to get the word out as best I could on what was wrong with WT, how it was wrong, why this actually constituted being called "wrong," and possible solutions to fix it.\nThis largely fell on deaf ears because the devs/community representatives/etc (whomsoever it concerns) are too busy being sycophantic, self-serving, ignorant, intent on dazzling the playerbase with smoke and mirrors, and a general disregard for major problems in the operation of the game and its general gameplay.\nThat I stuck around for so long shows just how good War Thunder is at its core. That is, its most basic gameplay is absolutely phenomenal even if it has problems due to imperfect flight models, bad balance choices for tiering in both directions, blatantly improper use of metrics for determining balance, damage models that feel like the devs threw darts at a dart board to determine how strong things were (my favorite being P-47 wings disintegrating to 0.30 caliber shells that the overwhelming majority of planes during WWII were largely immune to except in insanely large quantities measured in hundreds upon hundreds of individual strikes)...the list goes on.\nBut the devs don't care about fixing the actual problems with the game, flat out aren't being told it due to incompetent community representatives for one reason or another, and instead focus on pushing out more buggy, imbalanced, badly designed but gloriously modeled filler instead of spending a couple patches just making the game more fun at the gameplay level. This coupled with the blatant cash grabs that they've done making the game significantly more expensive to accomplish significantly less, and people are finally starting to wise up to those who left before and why, and choosing to leave as well.\nOr, to put it another way, for them, they just had the final straw put on the camel, and its back is broken.\nThis problem has been a long time coming, and people were desperate for the game to improve, but they're just now giving up. The game could have been that good.\nBut it also shows that the problem takes a very long time for most people to detect, and Gaijin right now is banking on that high turnover rate to stay profitable.\nThe best anyone can do is try to make people just joining the game stay away from it by warning them that it has serious problems, but this feeds back into the first point: The core gameplay is just that good that it masks the absolute failure that is its metagame and mismanagement for significant amounts of time. And until the reviews tank WT, this will continue to be the case." -Taranok\n","September 26, 2015","false","294.5"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","26","32","0","0"

Every single patch for the last year has been a mounting disappointment for me and the community. Just look at the feedback on the official forum or subReddit. Do not be fooled by their shiny graphics & vehicles. By the time you get to the mid-high tier matches you will understand why nearly all of Gaijin's most dedicated consumers have left the game. The developers, TIME and TIME AGAIN have demonstrated that they are INEPT at improving the gameplay. Any attempt to "fix" these balancing issues you will encounter as an intermediate player will make the grind EXTREMELY slow and YOU WILL NOT HAVE FUN. Gameplay in every mode (arcade, realistic, simulator) is slowly shrinking into enclaves of people abusing broken game mechanics, such as completely UFO flight models of aircraft that haven't been amended for months, tank shells that won't kill an enemy tank's crew member despite skewering him in the face, anything you can imagine in terms of WTF. Not to mention the recent battle-rating amendments that completely DESTROYED high-tier gameplay. You, new players, once you start getting a couple hundred matches into the game and unlock new tanks, you will come to realize that the developers will NEVER, AND I MEAN NEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LISTEN TO YOU OR YOUR PROBLEMS, EVEN IF THE GAME IS ENTIRELY BROKEN. Tell me new players, does a first model A6M Zero from 1939, deserve to fight a P47 introduced four years later? The devs certainly think so, and they will tier these two aircraft at almost the SAME battle rating! How about the ME-262, a jet introduced in 1944, routinely fight MiG-15's and F86 sabres from the Korean war? The developers have actually tried to JUSTIFY this, despite these aircraft being WORLDS apart in terms of performance. And now because there are no more players who want to offer themselves as cannon fodder to superior planes, the queing times for these higher-level matches are getting longer, and longer, and longer. Gaijin's solution: lower the Battle-Rating ceiling so that Korean war jets fight WW2 German PROPELLOR-DRIVEN planes, and 1944 tanks fight End-Game Cold War tanks that are virtually impervious to their guns. Forum moderators will shoot down negative posts without reading your feedback. Instead of fixing these ages-old broken game mechanics the developers insist on adding shiny new tanks at prohibitive prices to lure naive, trusting new players like you, and you will regret it. Take my word, I have been on the forums and other social media for years now, and I can tell you with the utmost certainty that the WarThunder playerbase is dying. Slowly, sure, but progressively and steadily. And The only ones to blame are Gaijin and their inept staff. I am almost certain that Warthunder will become a ghost-town before ships are released.\n\nI tried to cram as many reasons for YOU to not pick up this pile of garbage that WarThunder has devolved into within the last two years. Take it as you will, but know that you are funding a HYPOCRITICAL, CRIMINALLY INCOMPETENT, and GREED-DRIVEN company that does not care an OUNCE about what you think. Don't wait until you wasted a couple dozen hours into the grind, only to discover what the rest of the veterans already know. Trust me. My screen-name is cdahdude5, and if you really are curious to see how much time I've invested in this game go here and search my name: http://thunderskill.com/\n\nGaijin's playerbase was already shrinking, but this last patch of theirs is the nail in the coffin. Their losses are too great now, and I am highly pessimistic that the Gaijin staff will somehow save the game, and actually LISTEN to what their players have to say. Jesus coming back to Earth is more likely at this point.","September 25, 2015","false","384.9"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","1"

But it is everything but good.\n\nIt is really a pain...\nYou play great flight sims like Cliffs Of Dover, Battle Of Stalingrad or Rise of Flight just to find out that the multiplayer servers are ghost towns. Then you try out War Thunder. You are amazed by the graphics, the amount of content and the huge playerbase and it is even free to play!\n\nBut your amazement doesn't last for long.\n\n\n(1) The "matchmaking"\n\nFirst you start to realize the matchmaking is more than a little "off". Espacially playing the german tech tree is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥. If you pay attention and have a little knowledge about these ww2 vehicles you will notice that there is a huge time rift between the planes you are flying as germany and the planes the allied forces fly in the same match.\nBut it doesn't stop there. It isn't just the germans who suffer.\n\n-The entire game consists of sealclubbing and getting sealclubbed.-\n\nThe gamemechanics themselves support this by controlling everything for you by mouseaiming and target markers so that seemingly the only thing that matters is the vehicles performance.\n\nAt this point you might think: Yes sure, matchmaking is bad, but the game is still in beta, so it will eventually get better after the next patch.\n\nNo it won't. I'm playing this game for three years now and have invested houndreds of hours into it (didn't play it from steam) and I can tell you it gets worse and worse after each patch.\n\n\n(2) Flight models, "Realistic Battles" and "Simulator Battles"\n\nIf you are like me and you aren't interested in arcade games you will probably go straight into "realistic" or "simulator" battles. The problem is, that most of War Thunders player base is concentrated around arcade battles so the other two game modes get less and less attention by the devellopers each patch. They are basically removing content from these gamemodes instead of improoving them. For exemple since one patch that has been released this year "Realistic Battles" now have mixed factions. You will fly in an american plane side by side with a japanese one to shoot down germans and brits. That is what they call "realistic" now.\n\nSame ♥♥♥♥ goes on with the flight models. Almost all flight models in the game are placeholders. Some of them seriously broken. (Just to name two simple examples: With the japanese biplanes you where able to fly up straight into the air without stalling and reaching heights in which the pilot would probably freeze and suffocate. The bf 109 on the other hand gets its combat flaps ripped off when reaching speeds over 300kph)\nBut what does Gaijin do about it? Nothing! Since three years we get in every new patch new vehicles to attract new players and the old flight models remain untouched.\n\n\n(3) The root of all evil. Gaijin itself.\n\nThe problem with this game is not its engine or its game concept, its the company behind it.\nGaijins aim is to make quick money with this game. Moneymaking is nothing bad and every company needs to make money to survive but Gaijin has taken a rout which pisses on its playerbase in the worst possible fashion.\n\nHow does Gaijin make money? Do you need to pay money to play the game? No. Is it pay to win? Kind of, but thats not the main problem. What is the main problem then?\n\nThe main problem is, that Gaijin doesn't aim to earn money with long time players, but with players that jump in, get a first glance of the game, are amazed and pay money to get quickly to their favourite vehicles. Gaijin doesn't care that these players will soon realize that they have sunk money into a game that is horrible. Gaijin doesn't care that these players will leave with anger as long as there are new players comming in and paying money to get quicker to their desired vehicles. This is why the game is so bad because the game doesn't need to BE good to earn money, it just needs to LOOK good.\n\n\n(4) Gaijin and the playerbase\n\nAfter all the problems I have listed here I think this is the worst of all. I've allready said, that gaijin just uses new players to milk money out of them, but I think the worst thing is how they are treated afterwards.\nWhen people realize the problems with the game they go on the forum and complain about them. The most natural thing to do you would suggest, espacially when you have paid money for game content. Wrong!\nEven when people reaveal problems in the game in the most modest and friendly way they are are verbally attacked by Gaijins moderators in the worst and most childish manner. Posts and entire threads get deleted, players blocked or banned for simply pointing out problems and Youtubers get threatened for uploading videos criticising the game.\n\nThats Gaijins propaganda machine at work. They don't want the game to look bad for potential players because the potential players are their money base and not the players allready playing the game for a few months.\n\n\n(5) Summary\n\nThere is no game in the world that provokes as much fellings to me as this one. The reason being is that this game had so much potential to be an entry for a complete new generation of players into flight sims. It had so much potential to become something really big and revolutionary. But in the end this dream has been destroyed by the greed of its company: Gaijin.\n\nDo not play this game. I've sunk 20€ and probably well over 300 hours into it for nothing but pain, anger and frustration.","November 7, 2015","false","99.2"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","3"

Which was a massive mistake. I should have played this game every day when I had the time. I didn't, and I'm kicking myself for it.\n\nI think that this game should have stayed with the 20-rank system. Let me tell you why.\n\n-From what I've seen, overtiering wasn't a problem, as aircraft used to get into matches with others which were at worst 2-3 tiers higher than it.\n\n-Gaijin had 20 tiers of unlocks to play with, so putting an aircraft in slightly the wrong tier wasn't a big issue. Nowadays, if Gaijin screw up the battle rating on a plane, that plane becomes infuriating to fly - not that there's anything wrong with the plane, but because the matchmaking it gets is downright unfair. A perfect example of this in action is the low-tier German tech tree.\n\n-Expanding on 'overtiering', every plane and tank has its own battle rating. This is how matchmaking works for each of the 5 nations:\nUK: Fair matchmaking for appropriate aircraft.\nUS: Good matchmaking.\nJapan: Seems alright, I wouldn't really know.\nUSSR: TROLOLOLOLOL OP MATCHMAKING FOR OP PLANES TROLOLOLOLOLOLOL\nGermany: Don't even get me started... flying low-tier Germans is PAINFUL. Worst matchmaking, easily.\n\n-I have 95 hours on record or thereabouts for this game. It's by far the game I've played most on Steam - 90% of those hours have been spent after patch 1.37 was introduced. My highest tier aircraft is the F4U-1a Corsair, a rank 2 aircraft, and I'm at tier 2 with most other nations, after 85.5hrs played AFTER patch 1.37. If I keep playing this game, I reckon it's going to take me another 200 hours to get my first jets. Grindy, grindy, grindy, grind.\n\n-However, Gaijin are taking steps in the right direction to make the grind shorter and more bearable. They've reduced the amount of RP and Lions it takes to research and unlock aircraft and tanks by a large amount. Then they reduced the amount of RP you earn from tank battles. Errrr... not so keen on that, Gaijin.\n\n-Gameplay is solid for the vast majority of the time. Despite my lacking skill both in the air and on the ground, I can enjoy myself most of the time whilst playing this game. Maybe it's because I'm interested in WWII combat, maybe it's because I like unlocks.\n\n-Most of the planes and tanks you'd expect to be in the game are here.\nYou've got plenty of Bf-109 models, plenty of Fw-190s, He-111s, Do 217s, Spitfires, a few P-47s, a few Mustangs, A6M Zeroes, a G4M1, LaGG-3s, MiG-15s, you get the drill.\n\n-The game *should* look gorgeous on max settings. You do need a good computer to run it on max, though, but it should be worth it. I have a cr**py laptop though, so I can't confirm or deny anything.\n\n-Money is a problem from what I've heard. I try to always keep as large a sum of money on my account as I can.\n\nOverall, the game has its ups and downs, pros and cons, but I think the cons outweigh the pros, especially for your average Joe gamer - someone stuck down at low tiers, enduring idiot players, awful vehicles, what have you.

You -could- skip over it and not even read it, like this game does with it's tanks. "Oh unlock this tank, but if you use it you'll face Korean era end-game content that can pen you from ANY angle -what so ever- and since you can't pen THEM and you're too slow to maneuver around, you just have to bend over and take it!" So you're better off skipping this tank altogether, Tiger II H for example. Let's not even get into the ammo racks situation. Russian racks don't explode, period, once in a blue moon. German racks explode regardless of ammo-types or where you were penetraded, one stray fragment from AP will set them off.

In addition to this, the devs frequently make asinine balance changes that ultimately lower the quality of the game more often than not.\n\nI could honestly go on, but it would make this review too long going into the nitty gritty.  The point is, as long as Gaijin is running this game, it will always be destined to get worse over time, not better.\n\nDespite this, the raw gameplay will suck you in and the overpricing will wring you for all you're worth before it tosses you aside with its easily missed legacy problems.

Trust me when I say this. It's a good game concept and to be honest I would like to continue playing this game, it was a good game. Now, well, you have to understand that these game developers like most other game developers in our current age are greedy little ***** who don't pay attention to the game but to the money. What can we do? Stop other people from wasting their time and money. Don't play this game. I would rather play 'Armored Warfare' or 'World of Tanks'. At least you can continue getting tanks without much need of the use of money. 'War Thunder' on the other hand, if you want to get above tier 3, you can either pay up or grind for the next 3 to 5 months for 1 tank or plane. The game itself is good, but the developers decisions are not.\n\n<EDIT>\n\nI think it would be more for ground forces vehicles than planes. Some high tier planes can be accquired much easier than high tier tanks. But all in all, after a certain stage higher in the tech tree, it becomes almost impossible to unlock anything without the use of money, unless you are willing to spend almost 3 to 4 months depending on how much time you have. This means the game is catered more towards the players with more money to spend. Don't get me wrong, you can still obtain vehicles at high tier without the use of money. It is just not practical with the amount of time you need and have to grind through. For someone who does not have 24 hours a day to play every day. A great game suddenly becomes a chore. As I have said, I would still continue playing this game, but I cannot recommand it as of yet because of how the developers react and respond towards bad reviews and handle these situations. If you would like to understand more about why I gave this review.

I had purchased the Sherman tank package in order to get access to early beta (which was only 2 nights a week and a time that I could not play).  I logged in recently to find I had a negative 2000 golden eagle balance and was notified that it was due to a bug on Gaijin's end.  I had not received the extra golden eagles but the system thought I did and removed it.  Gaijin's solution was to zero my balance and thus remove the 2000+ golden eagles that I had bought via steam.  I am not happy with the customer service on this and thus I cannot recommend this game for fear this could be a common situation in the future.\n\nAlso in ground forces. There is a serious bias towards Russian equipment. It was good but not that good. BR system needs a complete overhaul.  The economy for ground forces is atrocious and an embarassment for the design team.  Very difficult to make a decent profit in a win let alone a loss.  The lockout for leaving a battle is a joke.  It makes sense in Arcade mode but in realistic or simulator you get one vehicle maybe two before the match is done.  Once gone (god forbid you down't spawn in a rock and have to bail) you have to wait a stupid amount of time for something you have no control over, or very little.  I had hopes but frankly the game has a long ways to go.","January 23, 2014","false","405.1"," 39 of 58 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","39","58","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SgtBreastroker/recommended/236390/","SgtBreastroker","SgtBreastCannon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SgtBreastroker/","102 products in account","This is my 1.37 review.\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/cc8c867e167736659a21271ae1160e5f.png\n\nThis is the 1.39 review.\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/5b835eaacc8e4ac4d9a5eebd0429d5d9.png\n\nThis is the patch 1.41 review. I've spent enough time to get an idea of the new additions and new mechanics that were introduced with this patch and I'll highlight them below. First thing to note is that Patch 1.41 is not as big of a patch as 1.37 and 1.39 were. In fact it was released under a month that 1.39 was out. I'll highlight the changes below.\n\nThe biggest addition of patch 1.41 was the introduction of Ground Forces into the open beta phase for everybody. While this had a lot of hype built up and player numbers rose even breaking 100k the beta only introduced two countries, Germany and Russia. These countries don't even have fully fleshed out trees which I can understand but it makes me wonder when the other nations will get their Tank trees AND have them fully fleshed out.\n\nThe gameplay of Tanks is rather interesting. You have a tank, you play on different sections of familar maps given the task of eliminating other tanks, capturing objectives or defending points. Tanks is excellent with the detail that Gaijin have placed into the game. Like planes every part of a tank reacts differently to how it will perform when hit. Your ammo can cook off or your tracks can get off. You do get the option to repair mid battle which is risky but useful. Something that is annoying however is the constant artillrry spam that all players do. Some realism aspects like armor thickness and certain shells not being able to penetrate is a great addition but doesn't bode well in the term of balance. Some reserve tanks are not competitive against even Tier 2 tanks as their shells can not pierce the armour. This is ignoring some tanks which are just unspeakably broken (KV-1).\n\nFor the planes we had a few additions. Germany received two new Me-262 Jets, one placed on the way to the German Sabre, and other with a 50mm cannon placed in a separate destroyer line (the Me410 with the 50mm cannons). The British received more Spitfires bringing their total in the entire tech tree to 13. The Americans received two B25 variants, one with a 75mm cannon and the other with an impressive 12 .50 cal mg's. The Russians get a Mig with cannons with a BR that guarantees low tier clubbing and the crazy brother of the I-185. The M71 Etalon.The Japanese received a cockpit for the Ki45 line. (yes, just cockpits).\n\nThese aren't the only changes, there were a massive amount of BR changes and these truly go to show how much Gaijin don't pay attention. Russian and American BR's went down while Germany and Japan skyrocketed. The high tier Japanese props have a higher BR than the Yak 15 and Yak 17 Jet. Granted those Jets are awful but that doesn't fare well for the fractured Japanese community. The Me-163 jumped back up into Mig and Sabre games after the amount of crying on the forums may have deafened Gaijin while the Mig 15 and Bis for Russia went down, the cannon Sabre went down whilst the German variants remain at 8.7. The msot controversial change was the P63 going from a 5.3 to a 4.0 Seal clubbing has never been so obvious. It leads to games all over the place. There is no balance, just pilot skill used to base the BR's which is a terrible decision as countries with large player bases have lots of data whilst countries with smaller playerbases have less data. It is why Japan are soaring high. Tier 2 A6M2 against Tier 4 La7 and P51? Clearly working as intended.\n\nIt's hard to give an honest opinion about what I think about this patch. Some areas could really do with a fix. Japan could do with more content. The BR system needs to be on PLANE PERFORMANCE and not player performance to ensure more balance and the Tank mechanics really give more tuning. I'll recommend the game for the addition of Ground Forces but I will not recommend Patch 1.41.","March 22, 2014","true","812.0"," 44 of 67 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","44","67","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shepuz/recommended/236390/","Shepuz","Shepuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shepuz/","242 products in account","War Thunder is a "free to play" game where you can either take it to the skies in a variety of different airplanes from different nations (USA, UK, GER, USSR and JAPAN), or you can jump in a rather well modeled and simulated tanks from light tanks to anti-air (USA, UK, GER, USSR).\n\nI have quite a lot of hours in to the game and there is a reason for that. I have enjoyed this "free to play" game in the past, and I would love to keep playing it but it seems that one of the patches that came out in the last few months, or something else has changed the restock and repair fee amounts in the game.\nBack when I still played actively you were able to outfit your plane/tank and play the game without worrying whether you had enough credits to pay for the restocking of ammo and repairing it after the match, regardless of the outcome of the match itself.\nToday I noticed while playing with my Rank III german armor, that even if I managed to kill 1 or 2 enemy tanks in arcade game AND if our team won the match, I lost credits when I came back to my hangar.\nI had 96k silver lions (credits used to pay for stuff ingame), I lost 3 tanks and managed to destroy 2 and our team won the match. In the after report I saw that I got slightly over 10K silver lion credits from the match but when I returned to the hangar, it showed I had 94.5k left, which means that unless you are super awesome at this game and manage to take all the points and destroy half of the enemy team without dying yourself even once, you won't be getting much anything out of the arcade matches in terms of credits to buy new tanks.\nThis is essentially the same method World of Tanks makes you buy premium and use real money at the end-tier tanks. Without one, you won't be able to afford the repair costs after the match etc. etc. etc.\n\nThis pretty much saddens me, especially when we aren't even talking about end-tier tanks here in War Thunder, we're talking about Rank III tanks.\nBecause I have no intention of spending any more real money on this game I suppose I will just have to drop it and stop playing. It's already almost impossible to get to IS-2, Tiger 2 and beyond without using real money, and the grind fest from Tiger H1 to Tiger 2 will literally take you months without premium unless you are willing to spend every waking hour playing the tank portion of the game.\n\nIt was fun War Thunder, maybe I'll come back when you cut the repair/rearm costs between matches and actually give players a change to get to the higher rank tanks without pulling out the old credit card.","April 3","false","398.3"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","18","21","2","10"

At first it was entertaining but after 2 weeks of playing it lost it's appeal. I really shouldn't have to submit myself for hours upon hours of tutotials on youtube and reading message boards to understand the game let alone have success at it.\n\nI purchased a premium membership and nothing changed. Everytime I get shot down it's by a guy 2-3 tiers above me in a vastly superior plane. Matchmaking needs to be better (I.E tier 2 fly against other tier 2's) but it appears that's not of concern for Gaijin. Since I work and have some semblence of a life then apparently this is not the game for me since I require another three months of watching youtube video's and playing to even begin having success. There are dozens upon dozens of bad reviews regarding this game and all are centered around the 1.37 update which made me realize that it wasn't all my fault as to why I wasn't having success at this game. The comparisons to a "hedge fund" and "ponzi scheme" are accurate and I'm officially boycotting this game until these issues are fixed.\n\nThe concept is great concerning the vintage WWII planes. Soundtrack and graphics are also appealing. Flying for 2 minutes then getting shot down by a higher level plan of which I stand no chance against......is not.\n\nI purchased the premium membership 3 days ago, I'm walking away from the game and Gaijin can keep the 2700 golden eagles I have on the account.","January 17, 2014","false","84.0"," 54 of 86 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","54","86","0","0"

Far easier if you purchased in game currency of course.\n\nHowever, when they released patch 1.37 they ruined the game. Made it 4-5x harder to progress, devalued the in game currency so any prior purchases were essentially worthless... But the worst thing they did was alter the flight characteristics of some of the most popular aircraft to make then virtually unflyable... This was a game that was supposed to be balanced in terms of the aircraft/skill level of the players online. Instead you got dumped into games with players in far superior aircraft. It was like putting a Jet fighter up against a bi-plane.\n\nIf you had a preference for Bombers as many people did... forget playing it anymore. Aircraft were basically crippled and rendered useless in battles.\n\nThe they released patch 1.39 and I tried to update... forget it. They use bit torrent to spread the downloads amongst their players rather than provide a server for people to get it directly. The problem with this is that the download speeds are virtually non existant. People can turn of the sharing aspect and I suspect the majority do just that. I left the game attempting to update for 35hrs and had downloaed just 2% of the 5+GB update. At that rate it was going to take me weeks just to update the game.\n\nGaijin's customer service is pathetic, offering no help what so ever... Their advice on the slow downloads was " wait and it will finish" I saw complaints deleted, people banned for asking simple questions.\n\nI removed the game and will not play it again.","July 28, 2014","false","161.7"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

While I'm certain many of these reviewers' points have merit, I believe it is important to consider their viewpoint and that theirs might not be yours.\n\nBy all appearances, the game is not fun anymore for people who have played it for thousands of hours and/or prefer Tier V (Highest tier / Most modern vehicles) realistic/simulator mode tank battles as non-Russian nations.\n\nAs someone who has spent a couple hundred hours playing as Germany, U.S.A. and GB in up to T IV air arcade battles, and as Germany in up to T III tank arcade battles, I am here to tell you: This game is a lot of fun, I have encountered few balancing issues and fewer bugs, and I'm relatively sure I'll be playing another few hundred hours before I get bored of it and move on.\n\nIf you are interested/curious, just install the game and try it for a few hours, it's f2p, after all. Due to the slow progression, I definitely recommend getting a premium account to speed things up a bit, if you end up liking the game. If you aren't stupid/rich enough to buy the ridiculously overpriced premium vehicles (that offer no real advantage apart from another progression speed boost), you will find War Thunder to be well worth the subscription cost.","February 20","true","213.7"," 84 of 141 people (60%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","60","84","141","9","10"

At its heart, it is a very great game.  It's developed well, it looks pretty good and it offers a diverse take on the whole PvP plane or tank game.  It doesn't have stupid health bars or weird aiming mechanics, where you hit the enemy plane or tank takes a major role.  There are bugs, yes, some incredibly ridiculous, but they are usually fixed quickly.  Usually.\n\nWhere Warthunder falls short isn't in the game itself.  It's not overly Pay 2 Win, you can unluck every vehicle by purely playing the game without paying a cent.  There are premium vehicles that you can pay for, but they are usually are reskins or one-off paper tanks that usually won't give much more of an advantage.  I say usually because the rocket tanks are incredibly over-powered, but they are also hella expensive.  I've only ever seen one in game.\n\nWarthunder fails at community development.  It's community is fractured and diverse and its community managers are hostile and condescending.  Gaijin will not do a single solitary thing based on the voice of the community, no matter how hard the community will push to get something changed or added.  Gaijin bases all of its decisions on numbers, their own numbers, and are rarely wont to put any faith in their playerbase.  In fact, there are many times when they are openly hostile on their forums, placing the blame on players or entirely dismissing the voice of the community.  Their forum moderators are akin to the Gestapo or more appropriately the NKVD.  Any sort of negative opinion is immediately met with a ban and the comment deleted.  Petitions by the community are put up and vastly ignored.  Gaijin even pulled out its community managers from r/warthunder, probably their best oppurtunity to get feedback toward their game because of the upvote system,  and instead of listening they simply left.\n\nI want Warthunder to succeed, but until Gaijin want it to it never will.\n\nAlso, I just use the direct launcher instead of Steam, which is why my number of hours played is so low.  I've been playing off and on for close to three years.","November 8, 2015","false","24.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

I thought that matchmaking was sketchy enough with the old system of 20 tiers of planes you unlock through nation EXP.  Now you have five tiers that you unlock various planes by using other planes or some such thing.  But what that means for me is that I have planes that were tier 6 previously being pitted against tier 10 and higher planes in the previous patches.  I am getting killed in basically one hit all the time, and it makes me never want to play the game again.\n\nupdate as of 12/20/2015:\n\nGame still broken, matchmaking is absurd, since the Ground Forces came out I was really excited for a "realistic" tank combat game, however, there needs to be a balance between "realism" and fun.  Right now you can expect to get shot right out the spawn and then (if you aren't killed immediately) you spend the better part of a minute waiting to repair whatever got damaged.  I'm sorry if I don't find waiting very fun.

Its closest competitors are both flight sims and the super-arcadey World of Tanks/Warplanes, with WT filling a niche in the center.  It is for that reason that I enjoy it so much.  However, the "base" game mode is the Arcade difficulty, which is where Gaijin is clearly targetting.  A good majority of the game's balance is based around Arcade, and the most interesting mechanics abound there.  Realistic is where the most involved players tend to congregate, however, and the split between developer and fan focus creates some "interesting" dynamics in balance and gameplay.  And by interesting I mean horrible.\n\nThough there are certain aspects of the game that *are* balanced, there are others that have gone from horrendously overpowered to nearly useless in successive patches.  Most notably, bombers such as the B-17 were previously unstoppable death machines in all game modes, however as of patch 1.43 they have become almost paper in Realistic.  Though marginally more effective in Arcade (as with many changes this points toward developer focus) they are no longer the research/currency printing machines they once were.\n\nOf course, even with these issues, I have almost 600 hours in the game.  How, if it's so poorly balanced?  Well, simply, it's fun.  WoT is much more arcadey and has very different mechanics than WT's ground forces, and I like the higher-risk feel of WT's more "realistic" damage modeling.  The replacement of WoT/WoWP's hp system with internally modeled components and armor penetration (which is obfuscated in the other games) makes it feel like you get more information and feedback.  The planes feel easier to control.  You can one-shot people if you're skilled enough.  There are dozens of vehicles to unlock and very few of them are pre-war no-name biplanes or tanks.  The graphics engine is very very pretty.\n\nI honestly don't know.  I love the game, but also hate it.  And here I am logging in again.","November 7, 2014","true","265.9"," 102 of 174 people (59%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","59","102","174","7","0"

Hosting events, such as real battles, like the battle of Berlin, the assault on Iwo Jima and many other battles, they deliver what an enthusiast is looking for.\nThey also make sure there is something for everyone, with the "arcade battles" mode, where they put planes of any nation (USA, Nazi Germany, USSR, GB and Japan) with the "some-what" same preformance in a 15v15 battle anywhere on the globe, from Guam to Stalingrad.\n\nGameplay handle like a dream, the game is action packed beyond what you can ask from a F2P (Free to play) and there is as i mentioned before, something for everyone, if you want to dogfight, or level a military encampment to the ground with a well placed 1000kg (2000lb) bomb, or carpetbomb a convoy, even sink a battleship with a torpedo, it is right here for you.\n\nThe game preformes suprisingly well on even a low-grade PC, with a well optimised engine and good distance rendering, you can expect high fps (frames per second) almost no matter if you are playing on low or high graphics settings (depending on your PC hardware ofcourse), eigther you are flying at high or low altitude.

I thought i'd play this game maybe 10 years from when I started and still be addicted due to it's high potential. Yet now the developers have left us, and gone to sit in a pile of money we've thrown at them. Never buying a game from Gaijin again, and if you work for Gaijin and are reading this, please think about the consequences of your actions. Not only does having willingness to coorperate with your playerbase show 'care for your customers', but for the potential for you to make SO MUCH MORE money in the long run if you'd stop jacking around every update.\n\n1. FIX WHAT IS BROKEN\n2. DON'T 'FIX' WHAT ISN'T BROKEN\n3. RELEASE THE STATISTICS YOU CLAIM WHICH PROVE YOUR POINT\n\nIf you do this, many people will play your game again, I can PROMISE you that.\n\nFinally if I were to decide when everything when down hill, it was patch 1.37 when you introduced the BR system. Patch 1.35 was without a doubt the best WT patch yet, and still is. If I could uninstall and go back to the old game, i'd still enjoy is despite the lower graphics, the fewer planes, and the lack of tanks. Do you know why? Because back even if the flight models weren't PERFECT, every plane could compete with what it had to face, and it was somewhat historically accurate. By God, I wish someone would copy your 1.35 patch and simply make their own game from that! I'd pay tons of money just to play what you guys started out with.\n\n\nIf you just care about money though, Gaijin, you still greatly influence people who play your game. For example i've talked to DOZENS of people who have taken actual interests in flight and flying for a living due to their enthusiasm from playing WT. In fact, i'm one of those people. Two summers ago I took flying lessons and finally obtained a license to fly at age 17. Flying never would have been something i'd ever do if it wasn't for this game. Honestly, for people like myself, you're throwing the whole point away now. New players who once would have been so happy with WT that they'd consider taking flying lessons now quickly label WT as another, normal F2P with nothing special inside, and nothing that makes any normal player want to grasp for more.\n\nBut whatever, Gaijin won't ever read this, i'm still wasting my time with WT by typing this. It'd be better if I just end this review now, I hope this game gets fixed. I do not hope it gets fixed just so that *I* can play it again, but so that you can introduce more people into the wonderful world of Aerial Travel in the long run.

Great right? The problem here is, the base of this game is an complete and utter wreck, while most online games suffer from poorly implented band-aids, this game could use a few. The same problems that were apparent in 1.25 are still there, with each patch and addition of new content only adding more and more. At this point the game is standing on a poorly contructed foundation with a number of medicore "balances" only further eating away at it. The BR system that was supposed to be the messiah for all imbalances in the game when introduced has at best stayed in the same cluster♥♥♥♥ as it was in when introduced, and at worst has only further became ♥♥♥♥ed with more and more vehicles being thrown into it. The few times devoplers actually acknowledge a problem, we are given the same answers we were given two ♥♥♥♥ing years ago, "We're working on it". To the people who still think betas for games are actually for fixing and helping devolpment, let alone those who try to use this games excuse for one as a way to defend it from criticism, wake up. This game is going into it's third year of open beta, they've had ample time to fix plenty of these problems and yet still here they remain. I want this game to be good, there is a real lack of it's type out there, but it's never going to find that success like WoT did until they go back and wade through their own ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to fix the mistakes they made years ago.\n\nTL;DR\nThis game has been a mess for a long time and has only gotten worse. Devs refuse to fix core elements and would rather implement new unbalanced premium vehicles than actually go and fix them.","August 3, 2015","false","87.2"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","24","35","0","3"

Well, because with every update Devs also change all stats of most tanks (and planes still), their speed and their firing and pen power.\nA tank, that you have painstakingly leveled up for example, is one day very maneuverable and/or its gun has great penetrating ability , but just a day after that, after a minor patch, it is total garbage. Same goes for planes too, well certain planes and nations.\nThis all has to mean one or two things. One could be that Devs haven't yet agreed on the historical stats of said war tanks and planes, or they have but they decided to change them every so often to throw players off their feet and make us use all the other machines in the arsenal instead of playing with just our 'best ones'.\nThis situation has caused me quite some grief and a feeling that I have invested large time and some resources into a product that is NOT SOLID or sound and so I have to warn others, buyer beware, caveat emptor!\n\nThat's it, if things change in the future, this review will change accordingly.\n\nFew more observtions:\n- other players on your team not communicating, acting as bots or writing in Russian.\n- virtually NO teamplay because of this lack of communication\n- matches feel boring and lifeless because no other missions available except capture and bomb bases.\n- even though Gaijin has added PS4 players to the mix after adding tanks, active player numbers during the week have increased only by 20K at peak hours, but game modes have doubled, thus making even less players available for each mode AB, RB and SB and as result having much longer wait times for certain gameplays and more unfair matchmaking.\n- no mixed battles for arcades... that is beyond silly because very likely that would be the most frequented style of play if enabled. I think Gaijins excuse is that Heavy bombers would just carpet bomb all the tanks with constant reload....Well, can't you freakin limit the numbers of heavy bombers per match or put them on a 5 minute reload timer???\n\n- conclusion is that Gaijin makes weird and nonsensical gameplay decisions, directly influencing the FUN factor and making War Thunder just an eye candy rather than a solid multiplayer game.\n\nThis review comes from the heart with hope that THINGS MIGHT change. That Gaijin might one day perhaps hire a person that KNOWS how to organize game modes so that players actually enjoy playing the game, feel competitive and feel rewarded when they upgrade their war machines.","January 1, 2014","false","696.9"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","25","37","0","0"

I was researching the Maus but gave up in the end and just boosted my way there because of the endless slaughter of being matched against stuff i can even pen. You want to have fun in tanks, play in tier 3 and lower.\n\n- Planes are similar, i mean we've all had that moment when we just want to kill ourselfs when we get rekt by that 3.7 FW which is placed in tier 2 (Because Logic) which will ruin anything in its path. I mainly play Britian planes and i never seem to actually be killed by anything but a Yak, Lag, FW or BF. I think you stand more of a chance in planes being match against high tier planes because theyre all made out of paper, yes they can out run you but atleast you still stand a chance unlike tanks. I just wish planes actually had some more good maps, they're all so repetitive, boring and all so open.\n\n- Taking away the 2x for your first battle at first seemed like a good idea with it being replaced with the daily rewards. You would be wrong in thinking the more days you play the better stuff you would get, in fact you're actually better off just playing it every other day. For example im on the 148th day now and ive just got a 10% silver lions boost, im so glad i've been loyal to the game for this long so i can get rewarded like this! They should start adding big golden eagle drops when you get past 100 days, i mean there is literally nothing that makes me want to continue this streak apart from my head telling me that there might yet be something good.\n\n- This game is also now turning p2w with all these rocket tanks they are bringing out as premium tanks and then placing them in tier 2.\n\nSo no overall i don't think people should start playing this game unless you want to make yourself go insane or until the devs actually listen and fix this ♥♥♥♥ed up game.\n\nEdit - Just hit my 149th day and got 4 silver lion boosts of and a silver lion wager, 10/10 would waste life away again.","October 27, 2015","false","747.1"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","5"

This is good example to remember whenever we make claims about anything, comrade.\n\nMaybe if game was made by someone else we could fix these problems, but that would mean handing creative control over to people who didn't live in fear of being sent to Siberia if any actual realism slipped in or if they couldn't make their protection money payments to Glorious Leader Putin.

But now that they've patched and updated several more times, it has lost its fun factor, due to the creators having made the game extremely difficult to proceed (levels etc) without paying money.\nI started playing while they  still had levelled planes and such, and that was when you could buy the planes without research points (which now you have to buy with real money) and so you're stuck playing untill you have enough research points to buy ONE plane... ONE! You'd think that you could buy two or maybe three, but when you play a battle, your battle points go towards a single plane which is unlocked eventually after about six successful battles. So if you get this game and think you're going to coast through to the top level, be prepared to buy a premium account and dish out the money to get there.","February 20, 2014","false","382.9"," 44 of 73 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","44","73","0","1"

Although, it is free! ... -ish.\n\nBeing an old Starfox veteran, I got on well with the arcadey action in the early game, out-manoeuvring enemies and chopping their wings off with the target-leading system. Each nation has a different set of planes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, although these don't matter too much at this early stage. Needless to say, the bi-plane stage was great fun.\n\nThen, gradually, I progressed into the mid-war era of aircraft. This was fun, too, for a while. But then I started to notice a change in the play style of my team mates and my opponents. Instead of rolling away from each other to engage in a dogfight, my opponents would just fly straight towards my plane guns-blazing, then plough straight through me like a battering ram, killing both of us with no points scored either side. Get used to these head-on collisions. They happen a lot. And not just with enemies. Sometimes, you'll be chasing a plane, only to find that a cloud of friendly players has formed around you, fixated on the same target, trying to nab the kill before you do. Because of this tunnel-vision, eventually a team-mate will collide with you, then call you a 'F**KING RAMMER N00B' for your trouble. Lovely.\n\nMy main problem with this outcome is that there is very little penalty to prevent it on either side. So the conflict just develops into a war of attrition - to see which side has bought the most planes to aimlessly throw into the meat-grinder.\n\nAlternatively, you'll get locked in a dogfight with a superior plane (usually a spitfire, with its better turning circle) and no friends will be around to get it off your tail, because 10 of them will be chasing 1 bomber ... and crashing into each other ... and yelling expletives in the chat box.\n\nI get the impression that the game wants me to spend money to buy super upgrades for my planes to make them pointlessly unbeatable, like in World of Tanks, or create a squadron of other people who enjoy getting rammed by their team mates. However, my reviewing system is based off the capacity enjoy a game even if you're a friendless hobo. So, if you're looking for some quick arcade dogfighting action, this game is one for you. However, if you're a fan of aviation looking for a dedicated team-based stress buster, you'll find this game utterly infuriating.\n\nThey will eventually add tanks and ships into the mix, but until then, I'm not convinced.\n\nSorry, Warthunder.

The game was rife with potential but is constantly re-broken with every patch. The developers are really trying, but unfortunately have no way to properly communicate with the community, so they end up "fixing" what isn't broken and breaking further what's already irrepairably damaged.\n\nThe management, the forum moderators, and everyone else involved with community-to-developer relations has not a bloody clue as to what they're doing. Community asks for bug fixes and flight model updates for a certain aircraft? Gaijin ignores that aircraft. Community asks for repair costs for a certain nation to fall in line with the rest? Gaijin doubles the repair costs for that nation.\n\nAnd just don't even try to criticize them in any way. The entire management team can't take a shred of criticism, and pretends the community is out to get them, all the while actively antagonizing the community and ignoring their requests. Forum posts regarding poor balancing or unhistorical performance are met with smug, arrogant condescension.... IF they aren't flat out removed.\n\nYou want to play an arcade flight game? World of Warplanes (never thought I'd say that)\n\nYou want a simulator? IL2, DCS, the list goes on to a billion.\n\nAnd did I mention this game is free? It's free..... and I still wouldn't recommend a download. The company involved has spurned all support of the game. They deserve to watch their game crumble, but either way will end up blaming the "toxic" community they bred.\n\n3/10 - Disappointing beyond all measure, imbalanced and poorly managed beyond all comprehension.

Gaijin Entertainment has decided there is more money to be grabbed with simple game mechanics which makes the game accessible to a wider audience, even console gamers who have joined in on their PS4 as of the past year. However for people like me, this has slowly taken away everything that I initially likes. Progression has become more pay to advance faster. As a result of this new business model, Arcade and realistic battles have been gaining a lot of players, while simulator battles has been draining players steadily. It has come to a point where simulator battles only play a minor role in event missions, in which a person is not even able to pick their tier or vehicle of choice in many cases. This week I finally decided to uninstall the game when I discovered that while I was not playing the game for a few months, they changed the tank sniper mode aiming mechanics entirely to a very weird and completely unplayable state for me, with no alternative option to switch back to old style controls (at least not in simulator battles as I understand it). Which means that I can only play the by now extremely scarce simulator flight battles. There is nothing for me anymore in this game now, and I will say goodbye to it after many years of fun. If things ever change I may come back, however with Gainjin's new mindset I don't see that ever happening.\n\nTo make a simple conclusion:\n\n-Do you like World of Tanks merged with World of Planes, with better mechanics, graphics and a better experience in general? Totally play this game!\n\n-Do you like a highly immersive experience with many elements similar to the challange of simulator games? This used to be pretty good, but not anymore. Go play Il-2.","February 8","false","239.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

However, it stops there really. This game is incredibbly unrealistic even in realistic and sim. Flight models are just ♥♥♥♥ed up on so many different levels. For example whilst in real life the hunter was a rather manuverable aircraft in game its like "hur dur tis heavy must turn bad" secondly you would think with that good accleration and heavy weight it would hold energy well...nope turn slightly and you stall out. the balance is terrble adding things like the mig 17. It out runs and turn the hunter. Balance ))))) Gaijin clame no bias but it is so obvious. Tripple a easily reks my british and american jets but it never touched my russian jets. THAT is not a coincidence. It happens all the time. Also noticce how in the last patches (2) all thats happened is adding the mig 17 to overpower everything and buffing hte mig 15 to help the stomp. Russianss jets never snap there wings in turns yet the historically strong hunter easily rips at 11 gs (over 900) same with sabre. Not to mention all the other british and us jets that rip.\n\nThis is jsut a very small aprt of the game im focusing on but its a larger scale then i indicated.  Oh and about battle ratings. gaijin things ww2 era meteor f mk 3 fighting late korean war mig 17 a is a fair fight axaxaxax)))) tovarvisch such balance.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragethan/recommended/236390/","dragethan","Brandon764","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragethan/","191 products in account","Throughout the course of this game, my opinion has largely changed. I used to recall on the game as a pioneer of the aircraft simulator franchise as it embarked into the realms of World War II and its epic course, now I can only review this game as a mediocre displacement from that former realization of it being a "wonder".\n\nTo begin, the company, Gaijin Entertainment, is ridiculous at best. I used to be a strong advocate of another title of the company - Star Conflict - until they nearly dedicated all resources to War Thunder alone. The company is infamous for dropping titles and other assets in pursuit of other monetary ventures. I still rather miss playing Star Conflict as it felt like a new take on space combat (Mind you, this was before Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous, and several other acclaimed space simulators to be). Though my regards on Star Conflict do not reflect War Thunder, it reflects my opinion of the company that seems like it desires to be the next EA of Russia. Oh that reminds me, in its conveying of the depressing updates of Star Conflict, and other titles, they apparently have no English representive (Or that person needs to be fired) as it seems like the company uses Google Translate to loosely translate press releases to the customer. Personally, I like to hold onto Star Conflict and War Thunder simply so that I can read statements with grammatical errors so blatantly obivious, it is a pain to the eye while a laughter to the brain.\n\nTo the matters of War Thunder, I used to play this game on a daily basis - to this day I maintain 175.5 hours - I would most likely have 1,000+ if I did not stop playing this game however. With the release of patch 1.37, to "decrease" waiting times for flight battles, Gaijin decided to remove several tiers and merge them into a few. Now, what does that mean? It means instead of matching against a player with a similar aircraft tier, it means going against individuals that can either be incredibly above you in level or incredibly low. To me, this seems like an attack against those who are just picking up War Thunder. How is it that a company can maintain a player basis when it invites new ones into battles that are significantly outmatched? I suppose the developers are able to achieve this, but I suppose the fame will outrun its course.\n\nAs a reflection though of the current update, Ground Combat, I was elated beyond scale. I stayed up overnight to download the update and to finally get into my tank to discover how fun it was. While the ground forces update is exceptional, it is amazingly generic. I would dare to say it seems like Gaijin dissected World of Tanks to mirror the tanks and battles to the very   controls and combat. Personally, I almost laugh simply because I have wondered if Gaijin Entertainment and WarGaming (Developers of World of Tanks, Wartanks, and Warships) are brothers - family in ownership.\n\nThough my opinion and reflection of War Thunder is based primarily upon patch 1.37 and the company's background, I cannot sadly recommend this game. I still take fun in participating in air battles and tank battles on the occasion. Knowing the company's background, I cannot but wonder when they devise a new title that maintains such high success if not higher than War Thunder, when they will suddenly drop frequent updates to pursue the next monetary venture. If you're interested, look up Star Conflict on Steam and review updates and other news for the game. Everytime that I do that now, I simply get depressed. I wonder if people even know that this company has maintained other somewhat successful titles before this one, considering it seems like Gaijin throws old titles and other former successes off a cliff into a void of neglect. In my opinion, if a company releases a title, that company must maintain fixes for bugs and glitches while releasing new content to increase the player basis - in a professional manner. Considering Gaijin most likely uses Google Translate rather than an English interpreter, translations of the updates and other press notices are astounding. My yet born nephew would probably understand and convey English better than Gaijin.\n\nNOTE: This review reflects mainly upon the ethics of the company. If you are looking for a game to play occasionally that reflects your desires to defeat the Axis or Allied Powers of World War II in a simulated fashion, I would recommend this game. Though, I would stay WarGaming's titles would be a better choice. As a very frequent gamer, please take into account the ethics of  Gaijin - the next EA of Russia.","June 5, 2014","false","257.3"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","21","32","0","0"

You will always be put up against vehicles that you don't stand a chance against (for instance, Tigers are put up against Pershings and T32s, whos frontal armor is impervious to attack from the Tiger's 88mm, but sport a gun that can not just penetrate the armor of a Tiger, but go out the other end. Plus, these tanks in particular are fast, and to add insult to injury, the Pershing gets two spawns. But that is just one example. This is a reoccuring problem throughout the game.\n\nThe release of tanks promised to feature large maps, realistic specs, and no HP bars. And to some extent, it did achieve this. But once again, the matchmaker is the deciding force in the quality of this game. Also, the maps are quite tiny. Most of the time, tanks brawl it out at point blank range, which completely defeats the purpose of creating a "realistic tank sim" because the maps themselves include scenarios never feesible in real life.\n\nBut this game does have some appeal to it that makes me keep playing it. Maybe it's the graphics? No matter how much I despise this game, I can't avoid the urge to play it every once in a while, and of course, be disappointed every time.\n\nBut all in all, for a free-to-play game, it is fun for a while, and I would recommend it for someone who isn't planning on playing it for long. Definitely not for someone like myself who intended to put countless hours into it, though.","April 25, 2015","false","562.2"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","21","32","0","0"

I am an older gamer, from the mid 80's and as a rule I dont like making ingame purchases. But I am also an American and lack common sense. Ask any Canadian about us. Anyways, I made a purchase of ingame currency and it was all "lost" when I bought some upgrades. By no means did these upgrades use all of it. I submitted a ticket and to make a long story short I was told I would not be refunded the ingame currency and that I must have spent it all. What makes this all ludicrous is I never recieved the upgrades I supposedly spent everything on. I never played it again. In hindsight I dont feel I really lost too much after reading up on this companies behavior, practices and outright dismissal of historical facts. So I hope my review will temper the "very positive" rating they have right now since I dont believe they are on the right road to keeping it. I will just go back to Wot where I haven't been ripped off and they dont treat you like your IQ is 3 points above ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. That would be 73 points for all you guys who dont quite hit the mark....\n","December 15, 2015","false","11.7"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","2"

Flying a heavy bomber? Doesn't matter, one bust of machine gun from a I-16 and you have no wings. Driving a tank?

This game, for the first year or so, of its development, release and subsequent updates was a GOOD game. A fun game. A game that drew in people and stole a good chunk of Wargaming's World of Tanks fan/customer base with its air combat in one of three distinctly different game modes. All that changed with the introduction of their BS riddled battle rating system that they would, with each patch, adjust each plane's, and ground vehicles when they were introduced, "battle rating" to fight enemies the PLAYERS WHOM MAKE UP A TOP PERCENTAGE AND EXCELL within the vehicles in question while shafting everyone else. Every. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Patch. Time and time again you see a major increase in the number of SOVIET aircraft with their UFO like flight models outperforming, even though the Soviet UFO should never have gotten off the airstrip, other aircraft that make the "UFO" seem like a volkswagen. The same exact @!$^ is occuring on the ground as you see some BULL!@#$ T-34 get ammunition at a 3.3 battle rating, think Shermans and barely upgunned Panzer 4's with higher velocity 75's, that can penetrate and one shot a Tiger. A TIGER at medium to long range.\n\nAll in all, I would hope that those whom would be interested in this game..go play another game.

I actually ♥♥♥♥ something out this morning that was less ♥♥♥♥ than this game. True story.\n\nThe game is essentially a ploy to get you to pay them money. "Free" research points cannot be used unless you have eagles to convert them into usable research points... and of course eagles cost money. You can happily play through the first tier of planes for each region relatively easily, however as the tiers progress, the goals and upgrades become harder and harder to obtain, especially on free-to-play and thus push you towards getting a premium account or paying for game currency. When I first started playing the game, it certainly didn't have such an obvious push for cash but as the updates have rolled on, it's shown it's money grabbing side.\n\nMoney aside, the game is relatively good. The arcade mode is most people's favourite, with realism lowered and more emphasis on action. There are however two other online modes: Real Battles and Simulation. The game also offers a single player mode and campaign. The gameplay itself has been simplified and allows for control almost entirely through a mouse. There is a vast array of aircraft for several different regions, all of which can be upgraded and to a limited extent, customised overtime. There are also a multitude of maps, most containing land/sea units which have to be eliminated along with airfields and bases.\n\nFor more information read a better review than this one...","January 2, 2014","false","42.9"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","1"

This game, at first glance, seems like a fun game, and truthfully most of the time it is. However, the cons outweigh the pros in this game. For starters, once you enter tier 3 ground forces, the grind becomes unbelievably long and tedious. Even the modifications you have to research take quite a while, and it sucks that the game hinders you until you unlock these modifications. For example, not having parts or FPE can really screw you over, but if you play careful you should be fine. The problem lies with having to research adjustment of fire and the elevation mechanism. Your gun will be inaccurate as all hell until you research these two, which again is very frustrating. The whole battle rating system is confusing and unfair (Tiger E going against Tiger II's and T-44's when your line up is a Tiger E, H1, and a pz4 g). Some maps seems to favor certain spawnpoints, and the game can be a load of horsecrap sometimes with the gameplay. My main problem is the developers tactic of ignoring their community and making it nothing more than a money grabber pay to win game. And when I say pay to win, I dont mean buying premium tanks, I mean having to pay money to speed up a tedious research system. All in all, if your looking for a fun game to play, then by all means download this game. But dont expect to play it for too long before the games bullcrap starts to shine.","March 11","false","286.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","2"

The game has changed drastically. At update 1.39 I saw great potential in the game. Recently the developers have annoyed me to the point where I dont even want to pick this game up and play it. They advertised this game as being a simulator. All though there are some aspects of "realism", I've noticed that they have added a few things that really strike my nerve. Additions such as paper tanks that never saw combat  ie Maus, T-25, T-44, etc. Its gotten to the point where you would drive a tank from 1945, such as the m26 pershing, and be up against Leopard 1's, T-55's, and m60 pattons. On top of that the developers do not listen to the community which could possibly help them change broken aspects of the game! In short, If you love games that are historically accurate, I do not recommend playing this game.","March 18","false","736.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

I imagine that you come to this game because you like WW2 vehicles like me. Gaijin (The developers)  give you the finger constantly during your experience with the game. Insane bias. My friend pumped 300 .50 cals rounds in a yak-9 and didn't evn get a hit registered, but he could see the impacts on the yak-9. BEFORE YOU EVEN POSSIBLY THINK HE'S A BAD SHOT, THE YAK WAS LINED UP. Oh, and you know how japaneese aircraft blow up when they are set on fire? Well yeah, the fires on russian planes will take a flap off if you're lucky, and will always go out.\n\n\nWhat about the Germans? Well, as a German main, I am disgusted at how horrificly underpowered they are, it takes a fully upgraded BF-109 to be any use.

To put it simply, and kindly: a chaotic piece of s****. Armor has no meaning.

The Axis had been establishing their technological superiority at every turn, Great Britain was occupied by the German forces, and Stalin had been assassinated by German spies. The Soviet Union was broken, it's people scattered and turned into slaves by the tyrannical Führer's orders. The Japanese Empire, having suceeded in it's conquest of the Pacific, now moved it's fleets closer and closer to America itself. As the last Allied nation remaining, it was up to the US to fight, Fight for freedom before surrendering to opression. The joint japanese and german attack on America was brutal and efficient. Most coastal defenses were easily destroyed and, before most people even noticed it, the war was already lost.\n\nBut, hope always remains. For a few brave people survived, daring to live for freedom, even under the combined oppression of the Reich and the Japanese Empire. Those few people would keep on preparing, preparing for when they would retake their lands. It was so that, in the mid 50s, news reached the Resistance. News of a Nazi weapon that would ensure the Reich would reign supreme for more than a thousand years. A time machine. A device that could supress a rebellion before it even began. If the world was to ever know freedom, such a machine should never be used by the nazis.\n\nit was a costly operation, but the Resistance had no choice. I must spare you here of the details, but, after many sacrifices, the Resistance seized the schematics for this "Time machine". Some sought to destroy them, but a young scientist saw it's potentials. he made a copy of the schematics, and worked tirelessly day and night in secret. Moving around, on the run from both the opressors and his fellow resistance fighters who believed that machine would doom us all.\n\nFinally, it was done. It was but a simple machine on the outside, and there was no knowing what would happen to one who used it. The young man gathered all his courage. This was something worth risking his life for. If he failed, the world would continue being opressed forever. The Resistance would never defeat the Reich. But this... This was the single hope for mankind's freedom. With a deep breath, he took a step inside the machine, carrying with him all his knowledges and schematics of his timeline's weapons of war.\n\nAs he opened his eyes, he saw himself on a familiar place. It was his beloved hometown, once so beautiful, but now destroyed by nazi opression. That man that walked over there with a baby on his arms... Why did it resemble his father so much? The young man ran through the streets, snatching a newspaper from a nearby seller, barely able to contain his happiness. The year was 1931. The war had yet to start. This was his chance. He had a single chance to correct that which went wrong. With his knowledge from the future, he would change the course of the upcoming war.\n\nThrough many troubles which I'll spare you, he reached the US Army and convinced it's high command to give him a chance. His knowledge helped the US beyond words could permit. Some schemati the young man drew ended up being stolen, and were years later found to be in the possession of communists, but that was a small price to pay for the advantages that single young man brought to the war effort.\n\nWith his knowledges, US and USSR technology were years ahead of their time. They could work on german technology before the technology was even invented in Germany. They could throw planes that would be invented only years after in the war to aid them. And thus, the German war effort of Me 262s was utterly crushed by Sabres. Freedom was achieved thanks to the brave acts of those brave people who dared to defy tyranny even at the risk of their lives.","November 21, 2014","true","704.9"," 68 of 120 people (57%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","57","68","120","54","6"

I'm all for banter, but when people start attacking each other personally... that's an issue.\n\nIf you want to have any hope of progressing past tier 3, you almost HAVE to buy a premium account unless you are a God (news flash; you're not). Even then, this game is a tedious, un-fun grindfest. Rewards are extremely low, no matter how well you perform in a match, compared to the research price and credit cost of vehicles.\n\nThe battle rating system is just... broken. Almost nothing is rated properly. The game has a tendency of stacking teams as well. In other words one team is almost all higher battle ratings than the other. Couple this with the fact that many players lack a certain thing called "Common Sense." Then add the fact that the one team almost always has one (usually two) full squads of 4 players in a clan on Teamspeak/Vent/Skype/etc. and the other does not.\n\nWhen you add those together, you're basically playing Defeat Simulator 2014 (2014 because that's when battle ratings were introduced).\n\nIt's just... not fun.\n\nI don't recommend playing this game unless you want to give yourself a reason to just end it all... well. When it comes to tanks anyway.\n\nThe planes (minus jets. Jets are miserable) are ♥♥♥♥ing great.

The thing which really leeches the fun out of the game is the fact that as soon as you stick your head out of the first tier you will be matched against high tier 3 opponents. So how do you fight planes which are faster, turn better and have better guns and armor? Well, you don't. They will kill you head on, they will simply fly away, outturn or outclimb you if you manage to tail them. And how do you fight tanks which can penetrate your front armor with ease at long distance while you can maybe hope to damage them at close range from behind? Well, you don't.

They add vehicles and make changes according to real data.\n\nNow Gaijin make changes according to the amount of Vodka.\n\nSeveral most direct reasons that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off:\n1. US tank shells' penetration got nerfed and changed shot types (APBC to AP, like M103's M358 shots).\n2. XP55 incidents. (You should know what happened if you have the premium plane.)\n3. Bullsh*t changes to battle rating system. (Battle rating decides what vehicles you will see in a match.)\n4. Ridiculously unbalanced game while the CEO still insists the game is perfectly balanced.\n5. New vehicles always get sooooo OP for a couple of patches and then got nerfed to sh*t.\n6. Soviet noob rush kills everything.\n\nOMG can't list anymore. This list will become a 5000 words essay if you want me to list every bullsh*t currently in this game. Gaijin has been adding a bunch of unnecessary changes like UI changes into the game while the content of the game is as messy as my underwear closet. Stupid errors and mistakes are everywhere in the game. I afked for like 2 months and found out the game is even worse when I came back. I got so mad tonight and I deleted my previous 10/10 review and changed to this comment. Now I would literally give the game a -10/10 if possible.\n\nI loved this game Gaijin, we all loved this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/McKillsteal/recommended/236390/","McKillsteal","Giles Filth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/McKillsteal/","185 products in account","War Thunder is a free to play MMO Plane/Tank simulator with vehicles from the Spanish civil war, through World War 2 up to the Korean war.\nMy hours in this game would make you think I'd recommend this game, but I can't in good conscience do that. This game has both absolutely terrible qualities and redeeming qualities but ultimately it's not enough to recommend this game and below I'll tell you why. This review will be based mostly on my thoughts as a realistic game mode player.\nIf you want to skip the indepth review and just want my quick thoughts : It's a game that has great potential, but greed and lack of listening to the community are runing it. Give it a try if you're into your history or flight sim games as it's free, but you'll likely run into some things that will ruin it for you, I did and so have my friends who I play it with. Be it the grind, inbalance of matchmaking or the dreadful community.\n\nGood points\nLooks great - The game itself looks amazing, vehicles and locations have been carefully recreated to try their best to give an immersive experience and at a decent frame rate. I have a GTX 760 ti and run the air force part of the game at 100+ frames and the ground forces at 50+ frames on average. It dips from time to time depending on the map and the lighting.\n\nOptimised - Almost every update brings some new optimisation in the form of how the networking is handled or how everything is rendered and will run moderatley well on some modern potato machines.\n\nChoice - At this point in the game's development, there's a wide variety of what you can fly and drive with 5 nations : USA, Japan, Germany, Great Britain and the USSR. Every Nation has tanks except for Japan at the time of this review, and every Nation has a full air force, with Fighters, Bombers and Attackers to chose from and more are being added with each major update.\n\nProgression - To progress in this game, you research different vehicles at each tier, to progress to the next. You'll start off with Biplanes and eventually work your way up to Jets. Each vehicle has upgrades it can receive, from engine upgrades to armament upgrades like bombs or rockets, or bigger cannons. This sadly can end up being grindy if you don't have premium.\n\nGroups/Squads - If you have friends that play the game or will play it with you then you can form a group to go into matchmaking with, however you should ideally fly/drive vehicles of the same tier/battle rating (Battle rating is what defines what matches your vehicles go into, and what they go up against) Otherwise you can wind up with a slow, cumbersome biplane fighting against a post-war Jet.\n\nGame modes - There are 3 game modes in this game, Arcade which has little to no realism, other than bullets and shells have drop, certain armor cannot be penetrated by shells and you can't fly into space. 'Realistic' and that term is starting to become looser with every update but in this, your pilot can be knocked out if you pull high G turns, the flight models of planes are more realistic, you can rip of parts of your plane from going too fast. Lastly is simulator, it's called this as it is as a simulation of what it would of been like, or so they try to make it like that. In this game mode you have very little HUD, it is better off played with a joystick and your enemies have no markers over them, nor do friendlies at longer ranges.\n\nBad points\nRealism - I don't mean this as in I don't like how realistic it is, on the contrary it's not realistic enough. From them adding planes/tanks that never flew or saw action such as the Maus or the Horten 229. Another problem is in the realistic game mode which will see only biplanes fighting in the Korean war, or some Alternate history rubbish, which is Gaijin's answer to what would of happened if the cold war escalated right after WW2. Late war vehicles are going up against Korean war vehicles thanks to a new, messed up matchmaking system and is apparently no longer worth playing in late war Jets, as they get decimated by Korean era Jets.\n\nMatchmaking - This used to be a good point, or so I would believe but nowadays like I mentioned, the higher tiers are messed up and no longer worth playing. at the lowest tier, you have 'reserve' vehicles which used to only fight other reserve vehichles, but due to lack of players searching for games the entire system has been compressed, which is unfair on new players, who get absolutely clubbed if they're in a biplane, and go up against early monoplanes with cannons. Some nations are favoured more than others, but I'll touch on that later.\n\nLack of Map variety - This one was hard to word, as there's a lot of maps in the game, from almost every theater of war but some how the matchmaking doesn't like variety. Naval fighters for example in the American tree don't often get get into Naval maps, instead they get thrown in with the British on 'Alternate History:Berlin'. I've no clue why they've done this, there have been loads of terrific maps that are actually historical, such Malta and Guadal canal. This lack of variet often puts Bombers and attackers at a disadvantage as it's often more difficult, if not near impossible for them to contribute to their team, if all they have to attack is a carrier fleet, which will rip a single plane to shreds with laser guided flak( not actually laser guided).\n\nCommunity - This is pretty consistent with any game, particularly free games but the community is mostly God awful. There's obviously the few good people, who appreciate history, or how beautiful the game can look, but the majority is weeaboos, racists, unfunny meme-loving, man-childs or actual children. So just stay clear of that if you're still interested in the game.\n\nExploits - Though I said previously that they've optimised the game for bad PCs, this meant they added ultra low quality settings so even your grandma's oven could run the game, this brought the option (which has thankfully been removed since then) to completely remove foliage such as bushes and small trees in ground forces. This would give players the advantage of being able to see other players, who try to hide behind this foliage, which is more often than not big enough to conceal a Tank. Now the only option they have left in, is the ability to turn of grass + foliage in your optics, which puts players, who don't want to cheat and play the game at higher settings at a disadvantage. Another option is the game, while not really cheating is an option called 'verticle targetting' which essentially allows planes that have fixed guns to shoot bullets out the sides of their guns, rather than where they're actually aiming, which results in a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t kills and deaths as I have experienced on both ends.\n\nRussian Bias - Now alot of people are skeptical, as am I about the so called 'Russian bias' in the game as it is made by Russian developers, who were born or lived in a time where the soviet union still existed and so did the Communist ferevour. A lot of players who say it exists are just outright bad players, who think their American bomber can out turn a Russian fighter and proceed to get shot down, then claim it's 'Russian bias' that they lost. I believe it's a combination of patriotism, and unfair matchmaking. For example, Russia goes up against Every nation, including it's allies but only in Korean war games and Alt History. This is often bad for the allies as they're split between British and American planes, which fly quite differently and fight differently, resulting in a split and on top of that, more allied players fly bombers and attackers which results in less fighters, which results in them being outnumbered in dogfights (usually). Secondly you get a lot of Russian fighters, usually their post war super-prop planes that first flew in say 1946, fighting German planes from 1942.\n\nHopefully you found this review useful, if you did I'm glad I was of help.","March 10","false","692.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

After the latest update, any resembalance of balance that was left in the game was destroyed. The devs value queue times above anything else in the game and have made high tier tanks and planes extremely compressed with vehicles being sealclubbed as a norm. They refuse to use anything but player statistics when deciding where to place a vehicle's BR which leads to severe over or undertiering and further exacerbates the game's matchmaking problems. The official forums are ruled with a Stalin-like fist with any disent towards the devs' decisions being met with a ban and or post being deleted. The forum moderators do everything in their power to make sure that players have no contact with the devs and generally act like manchild wannabe dictators towards users and are constantly powertripping. the game does have a subreddit, which is better (usually) than the forums, but gaijin *officially* has no presence there. The sad thing is that the vehicles themselves have vastly improved compared to how they were two years ago, but the devs have consistently made researching vehicles a huge pain and matchmaking consistently more and more broken with every tweak they make to it. If you do get this game, just play it intermittently as trying to take it seriously will leave you burnt out and sick of it.","September 23, 2015","false","337.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

No more because Gajin had the great idea of lowering the maximum BR from 8.0 to 7,7.

So now you are faced against the top tear tanks like                   T-10M,Maus,IS-4M and others of same class whic is not very fair on my opinion. If Gajin did this to balance the german Tiger II (witch are pretty powerfu) why didin´t they lower also the IS-2 Mod44 BR.\nThe point of this review is i dont just understand the reason behind this change and it seems quite like the game is just asking for more money. Now of course i can be wrong but the "update" seems like its only goal is to make Gajin richer.\n\nWar Thunder is still extremely fun game at the tiers that this is not happening and don´t shy away from it for that reson but the players that have spent a good amount of time in War Thunder are geting trampled on by the pay to progress mechanic of this game.","September 24, 2015","false","227.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Almost every part of your tank\plane can be seperately damaged\destroyed and you must learn to adapt on the spot when this part or that becomes dysfunctional.

This fact is well known throughout the community yet the developers have still responded with denial.  In defense of the developers (Russia based "Gaijin", I believe that the bias is not simply catoring to Russians because "Russia is the best" but rather an error in the battle ranking\tiering of tanks which results in unfair matchmaking.  Specifically the post war IS2 tank is being put up against German tanks as far back as the Tiger 1.  Additionally some Russian tanks are able to use post war ammo that virtually ignores the famously formidible German armour.\nIf you want screenshots or statistical data message me or simply look for it on the internet.

"Error 80130182: The authorization server is unavailable"\nFollowed the fix instructions for it and got past that error message only to recieve another error message. "Failed to load player profile". The fixes I found suggested modifying ESET or Kaspersky settings, neither of which I use. Figured I'd try downloading the game directly. Started patching and low and behold, it started patching at an average of 20 kb/s. It jumped anywhere between 20 kb/s and 200 kb/s, a massive change from the 1.5 mb/s to 2 mb/s.\n\nThe estimated download time ranged from 56 days to 123 days. Personally, I didn't feel like waiting that long to play the game. I'd dismiss it as a problem on my end but a quick google search showed this was an issue affecting a lot of people and most of them didn't really have any idea what was causing it. If this issue changes somewhere down the road, I'd be all up for trying it, especially since it looks pretty interesting. As it is right now though, it doesn't really seem worth all this hassle.","July 18, 2014","false","0.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

It can get grindy, but you don't really need to pay a dime if you don't feel like it, but some days when they add a premium tank, it..it can feel like that at times.\n\nYou will hear Russian bias a lot, that because of Russian devs, glorious soviet vehicles must not be rendered inferior. Its a mixed bag again, but I see it more of a case that the developers would have an easier time finding specs and ♥♥♥♥ for soviet vehicles being Russian and all.\n\nBombers..they need love, they need a lot of love. If you, like me like the thought of carrying a huge ♥♥♥♥ing payload of liberation and socialism, you will not find it here much, bombers are in a funky place..they have glorious moments but more often just rendered as bait, BUT again, mixed bag.\n\nTanks are...I dunno, I don't have a great deal of experience with tanks, the BR rating, which is how they 'balance' the game seems to get more messed up in ground warfare than in the aviation side of things. Though this seems to be more end tier stuff, if you stick to the earlier tiers I've found the game is a lot more fun at times.\n\nThe game is outright ♥♥♥♥ed in terms of BR. I need to mention this, if you want an actual historical experience, stay away..do it for yourself and stay away, go and buy one of the IL-2 series, chances are, with the way they 'balance' the game, you'll often be facing ♥♥♥♥ that the respective plane/tank would never have gone up against, this exists on all levels of the BR but seems to really make an impact in the later tiers of it. GOOD LUCK! Its beyond ♥♥♥♥ed right now compared to what it used to be.","February 9","false","280.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

Sometimes\n• Fun ground combat... Sometimes\n• Wide selection of vehicles... To grind for\n\nCons:\n• A lack of admittance to problems\n• Unbalanced gameplay\n• Game relies more on type of vehicle than skill\n\nOverview:\n\nWar Thunder is an arcade like flight simulator with added tank combat for near full scale battles of both land and air. Published by the company Gaijin Entertainment and labeled as an MMO it is quite unlike any game I've ever played. There is an assortment of game modes ranging from Arcade, to Realistic, to Simulator, to Historical Events and Campaigns. There is also an assortment of Planes, Tanks, and Armored Vehicles that you can get your hands on, most of which all have their own style of play that differs from game mode to game mode. The community is rather live and active although not always in your language. None-the-less you're sure to find what you're looking for even if it isn't what you want to hear. It's an extremely fun and rather addicting game that costs you as little as a mouse click; that is assuming you can handle the grind and don't want every vehicle and advantage.\n\nThe Facts:\n\n1: Hit detection is a joke. There is a phrase we use called 'sparkling' and it's when you see your rounds sparkle on an aircraft. When this happens they do no damage because your client is not in sync with the server meaning the rounds you see hit only happened on your screen and never actually registered with the server.  This is exactly as bad as it sounds.\n\n2: Crew Points. In this game Crew Points is something that matters way too much. You gain Crew Points from simply playing the game, but in rather minute amounts. The survivability, mobility, accuracy, and pretty much everything is effected by Crew Points. I have over 1000 hours in this game and I've yet to max out a crew on any nation for either planes or tanks. This is in large part because I refused to pay money.\n\n3: Pay 2 Win. Many people say this game isn't pay to win and I understand their stance on the matter. My opinion differs however. You can pay money for more Crew Points at an astonishing rate. You can buy Crew Slots so you can bring more planes into Arcade Battle. You can buy Bushes and other Cover to add to your tank. You can buy Premium Time which helps you unlock Parts and Vehicles faster along with giving you more in game currency to unlock those Parts and vehicles. You can even unlock Parts flat out with money. Most of these you can get by simply playing the game others require money and each varies in the advantage it gives. In my opinion if you pay money and instantly become better than you were before you are by definition Paying to Win.\n\n4: The Grind for Vehicles and Parts and Crew Experience. Once you finish a grind and get a new vehicle it will have zero Parts. This fact alone puts you at a rather large disadvantage even more so for tanks with the inability to put out fires or repair and even to a larger extent to people who have no Crew Points. This essentially in my opinion throws an element of skill out the window. For higher tier vehicles you will be held at a rather severe disadvantage for many hours of gameplay until you unlock the essential items to be compete effectively. This forces users to either grind it out in what I personally think is a rather miserable experience or 'lets' the users who don't want to wait simply purchase the parts with money. All this means is the person who plays longer or spends more will be statistically better simply because of their Unlocks and Crew Points.\n\n5: Match Making is horrible. This is one of the things you will learn rather quick in this game. You will, at least half of the time, face someone of a higher Battle Rating than you and the better you do the more it will happen. In planes this means they can out gun you, out turn you, out run you, and out climb you. In tanks this can be expressed with one one word: OVERKILL. The shier disadvantage you are in when you're facing someone of a higher Battle Rating is enough to make you write a bad review like this.\n\n6: Russian Bias. There is a reason people joke about Soviet planes being made of 'Stalin Wood' or complain about the Soviet planes having laser spray cannons. What makes matters worse is they are Historically Accurate in regards to the 'Secret Documents recently discovered in Secret Bunkers'. That is an actual quote and I can't even argue it. The game in essentially built around everything that the Soviet vehicles do well at. There are exceptions to this like everything, but for the most part it is blatant.\n\n7: Cover and Concealment. Since you're able to change your graphics settings you're able to provide yourself with a clear advantage over others by removing Concealment from the game. Doing so removes most shrubs, all grass, and most all foliage on the battlefield. This allows you to see much farther and through a lot more than Tankers who are player on higher settings. This leads you to being shot from places that you can not see yourself.\n\n8: Randomness. Pure and simple randomness. From having your wing ripped off from a single small caliber bullet. To having your tank explode from hitting a tin can in the road. To having your pilot knocked out in the first shot from 1.5km out. To having your tank bounce a round off of it's barrel, have it land on your gunner port, have a sliver of it's metal touch your ammo, and have you now at the vehicle select screen wondering how. This game is completely and utterly random in most every regard that matters.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nIt's sad when you see a game with potential drift so far away from what it could become. Its even more sad when you see a game hide its problems behind the dedicated player base and by those who willingly choose not to see them. This was a fun game for me for many hours, but those hours took a toll. I started to see the problems for what they where and began to realize they most likely will never be fixed. Because the first step to solving a problem is admitting you have one.\n\nI would not recommend this game to people simply because it is not anywhere close to being friendly to new players. Those that have invested time and money into this game will always have a strong advantage over new players to an extent that it would ruin their experience.","June 9, 2015","false","170.2"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","19","30","3","0"

I haven't played tanks much, but a lot of things from the review are the same there as well.\n\nThe pay to win:\nCrew skills. Its bad enough that without paying money it will take you years to grind those up, and you really need to since they give massive advantages. Pilot vitality "skill" makes the pilot grow adamantium scales that when max out can even shrug off 20mm hits (so much for the advertised historical accuracy and realism), golden eyes for the pilot give a huge advantage in historical battles, and gunner accuracy for bombers adds chuck norrises to your crew that insta gib everything. ETC.  On top of that, there is a qualification (ace) that increases these skill over the regular limit and it can only be bought with gold, you can't even grind it up after no matter how long.\n\nPremium matchmaking: An example from the air tree - premium buffalo has 1.3 battle rating (battle rating is whats used to match planes vs each other) while the regular one thats exactly the same is 1.7 battle rating. This occasionally varies, sometimes after a while a new premium plane gets a normal battle rating, but hey, while they are the way they are for some planes, its baby seal clubbing.\n\nUpgrade system. Every plane stars out as "stock" and is gimped in performance (climb rate) by around 50% (!!!!!!!). For anyone with any clue of air combat its quite apparent that even discrepancy of 5% makes a massive difference, but the developers of war thunder had clearly too much vodka (they are Russian btw). For example - historically yak 3 is 25kph faster than bf109 g-2 and only 2kph faster than fw190 a-5. However, if you don't have the upgrades for the yak, you will never catch any of them, and if you don't have the upgrades for the a-5, you will be caught by yak3's very quickly making any historical accuracy or real tactics for those machines completely absent. Either you pay gold to upgrade your planes, or you will suffer in a horribly underperforming plane for a long, long time while grinding out millions of xp needed to even unlock the upgrades for purchase with regular currency. (on lower tiers the grind is much less significant however)\nRegarding tanks - being unable to extinguish the fire in a tank before the proper upgrade is purchased with either gold or grinded up, as well as only having 1 type of shell... well its alomost as bad as with the planes. Though with planes the differences in performance are a lot more significant.\n\nFlight models. They are completely out of whack. Most of Japanese planes have climb rates higher by over 50% than historical, making them total ufo's that out climb everything in the game and out turn everything as well. A lot of planes were and are beng added without any flight models, just a placeholder copy paste (why add them in the first place if the FM's aren't done yet?).\nHigh altitute performance is only modelled on some planes, some don't have it... KI-43 is still a ufo with a placeholder flight model for what... 3 years now?\n\nMatchmaking. The better you do at the game - the worse the matchmaking you will get. Apparently developers decided that you need to be punished for skill and your effort to learn air combat and do well, and therefore have implemented a system where trash players get put into lower BR matches to compensate for their lack of skill, and good players get thrown in to play against planes years ahead in development. Imagine dota or league of legends ( or even counter-strike) were to do something similar and give more hp to losers. Those games would be done the next day. So unless you are planning to be bad at war thunder - you are gonna have a bad time.\n\nThe false advertisment of historical accuracy:\nThere is 0 of the advertised historical accuracy in the game. The developers have stated on the official website that the current tiering is historical. Tier 1 - pre war, tier 2 - early war, tier 3 - mid war, tier - 4 late war and the final tier is corean war. So what do we have? *I've deleted the old part of the review but everything remained generally the same, some planes moved up and down but 1944 planes are matched with 1939 ones still. I'll just give one example, since I don't want to waste too much time writing about more planes like I did before. You can look things up yourself. 1944 F4U-1a corsair has the exact same battle rating as 1939 BF-109 E3, as well as some other 1939-1941 planes. The result? An unstoppable powerhouse of doom, such is the corsair flown properly. Nothing can compete with a late war Boom and Zoom energy fighter. It was so easy to club baby seals in it I genuenly felt bad.\n\n\nTo summarize: This game used to be quite a good game during early release and beta, but some of the broken ufo planes never got fixed, the developers keep adding planes with placeholder flight models to this day, the pay to win gets stronger and stronger. First it was the crew skills, then upgrades, then premium planes with lower battle ratings and ufo flight models...etc No real reason to play this game unless you want to throw in some cash to get a big advantage over other playes, and/or only fly broken ufo or rediculously undertiered planes.\n\n\nIf the amount of hours or dollars (120$) I have spent in this game doesn't not convince you I know pretty much everything about it inside out, here are some of my stat screenshots:\n\nArcade - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=198602305\nHistorical - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=585018799\nGeneral - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=585018856","November 27, 2013","false","948.2"," 67 of 121 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","67","121","0","47"

Me and some mates played all nations, both air and land, and what used to be a very good game with alot of options, has narrowed down to be a soviet game, basically. If you're flying planes you'll be generally way more successful with the soviet planes than any other nation, if you're playing land games you'll generally be way more successful in soviet tanks. And I do mean way more, like 5-6 times more.\n\nGraphics are really nice though, it's a beautiful game, but the development is going straight down the drain.\n\nYou'll hear and read alot about bias, and see developers answer it is not so. But if you play this game, play all nations and make your own judgement.\n\nDevelopers for that matter, never had any grudge with them, but seen them more or less bully critics.\n\nAnd how many games do you know of that implements censorship on their forums?

Just be aware of the community and company. The community can be good, but you got a couple of kids and clans (=oBRSo=) that act like a bunch of CoD 12 year old ♥♥♥♥.

The graphic, sound and images are quite good because they give you a feeling of actually being in the cockpit yourself. I have played about 726 hours on Warthunder, despite that this is a good game if you like warplanes and tanks of Worldwar 2 that is, this game has many issues which actually makes it less fun to play and enjoy the action.\n\nRegarding the tanks, I can say the game is very crappy. To put it simple down: it is nothing more than a kill-fest for the other party because of the many spawn campings. Nonetheless if you have the patience, you can sometimes destroy many tanks if you can keep your coolness. Regarding the warplanes, I can say the game is okay. You can choose to just attack ground troops or you could just go dogfighting in the air with the enemy planes. For me this was quite fun though.\n\nIn general the game has many faults. The most annoying fault is the matchmaking for both planes and tanks. This is very terrible because you are always put up against planes or tanks of a higher tier than your own. Now for planes it doesn't really have to be that bad if you can fly your plane efficiently. On many occasions I  have flown in bi-planes [of different nations] taking down planes like the Lagg, Yak or similar other planes. When it comes to tanks however the situation is slightly different because with tanks you can't maneuver  like the planes your way out of the enemy's path.\n\nAnother annoying aspect is the team killings and ramming [mainly in air arcade]. The hit registration is not correct or doesn't always register properly. Then you have the Russian bias [Russian planes/tanks].\n\nLast but not least the community itself. The community was nice but it tends to move towards being toxic. All in all I prefer to be neutral but to speak out my mind: I can't recommend this game.\n\nReasons for not recommending this game:\n-Terrible matchmaking\n-Incorrect historic information regarding planes/tanks\n-Faulty hit registration\n-Toxic community\n-Russian bias\n-Teamkillings\n-You have to pay for certain stuff [such as changing nickname, flag of country etc.]\n\nLike I mentioned the game is okay but due to the above mentioned reasons, you will lose fun and joy in the long run. Personally I am not really bothered by the Russian bias though but more due to the other reasons mentioned. However this is just my opinion on the game. Try it out and experience it for yourself.\n","November 6, 2015","false","726.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

If you had played this game for a while, you will start to notice that not only by ranks match making is working, but with "Battle rating" too. For example:\n\nIII tier tank BR: 3.7, 4.0, 4.3, 4.7, 5.0, 5.3 (if you got 3.7 you are ♥♥♥♥ed, the match making will put you with BR 5.0 all the time and sometimes 5.3 will apair, after a week of grind and wasted all your nerves, you will get 5.0 tier and will think : "finaly, i have walked out of this ♥♥♥♥") however, you will go of course for tier IV , now whats happens:\n\nIV tier tank BR: 6.3,6.7,7.0 (It seems ok, the max  BR that you will get in the team is 7.0 its about 1:10 of battles) But if you got 7.0 BR IV tier tank, you will be placed with max 8.0 tier witch is much more powerful when shity 7.0 (like T32) the chance with 7.0 BR that you will be placed with 6.3, 6.7, 7.0 is 10% ~.\n\nNow second:\n\nAmerican tanks (Dont choose it if you want to get more fun in the game)\n\nUntil III tier tanks its ok, seems the balance is bearable, but when you want to get IV tier tank, you will be facing alot of fu cking useless shermans against Tiger II, IS 2 (the most playable tanks at the moment) These tanks got better armor, armor piercing shells comparing with: M26, A41A1, T32, M36 GCM, (M19 is the best).\nAnd yes when you get the fu cking T32 you will be placed with 8.0 BR tanks and do nothing at all to them, you will be a fu cking meat until you get 8.0 BR tank too. And it takes again alot of nerves and time (ages) to grind it. NO FUN TO PLAY AT ALL, THEN THE TANKS IS LIKE A PAPER and cant even penetrate normaly Tiger II or IS2.. T32 should be 6.7 BR not 7.0... or the balance should change..\n\nThe american tanks is so fu cking god da mn owfuly nerfed as hell. DEV, i know it should be a realistic game, but come on, its just a GAME.... MAKE SOME BALANCE.\n\nAnd the last of it:\n\nNever choose american tanks, dont make a mistake like i did and dont waste your time... Play with Russian or German you wont regret it. I guess i'am quiting this game until DEV team make a better balance for the sake of the world\n\n","August 3, 2015","false","184.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

nope, you cant hide like this from enemy fire, you cant put your tank in a more favourable angle to the enemy fire. you'll have to wait 4 seconds to be able to do anything. also, crew doesn't give a damn if literally everything else is destroyed, but hell brakes loose if the chain is loose.\nkilling ai will not give you any points whatsoever for researching your already very weakly starting new units, so that it's even more of a pain to try and use new units. also, most matches have like 50% ai, which makes for very boring , since not very intelligent, play.\nthe greatest pros have to face the greatest noobs. fact, how else are they going to sustain their high rating?\n"this game aint a game, it's a simulation" - gaijin. the only thing that differentiates it from other games like world of tanks, (except everything mentioned) are (the very unrealistic battles (jk, but it's true)) sim battles that noone ♥♥♥♥ing plays for many reasons that i'm not going to get into. there is a lot else i dont want to get into, too, but i think i'm exceeding the character count.\n\nwould i recommend this game?\nhave you read my review?

I originially didn't link it to my steam account.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGreat game, I love flying around, dogfighting and ground pounding but there's just so much wrong with it right now. Namely, the battle rating system and Gaijins reliance on "their data" for it's balancing (the battle rating system (or BR system) is basically the match maker for those new to the game).\n\nFirst off, I'll start with my largest gripe, the BR system. This just doesn't work well enough for it to be in game, simply because the devs only adjust the BRs of planes/tanks off of player data, which is a huge problem. This makes tier 5 (highest tier in game) near unplayable. For example, the Me-262 C variants, 1945 jets with rocket boosters on them, fight F-86 F-2s and Hawker Hunters, Korean/1953 era jets. While the Me-262 Cs are good enough planes in game, they just can't catch up with, nor dogfight top tier jets (they struggle to take off their engines are that bad). Yet Gaijins "data" says they do "perfectly fine" where they are. That's only because in these battles, there are similar jets thrown into the slaughter they can actually kill outside of head ons. Vampires, Meteors (all of them), F-80s, MiG-9s, F9Fs. None of those should be in the place they are.\n\nI could rant for hours on this and all the individual adjustments they should make (lower tier planes have this issue as well to a lesser extent) but there's really no point. Gaijin refuses to listen to the community about this and just constantly refer to this invisible "data" when they make decisions like that. It's compressed tier 5 into oblivion, and as such, people leave out of frustration. Then it gets further compressed to increase queue times, loop, loop, etc. Eventually, if this keeps up, the game will die.\n\nAs for tanks, it just feels endlessly frustrating to play. Get one shot, forced to leave the match. Get shot from somewhere you couldnt see from because someone turned their graphics to the lowest settings to see you while you want to enjoy the grass/trees/smoke/etc and be immersed. Tanks are also subject to compression as well, but since I never played them much, I don't know much about that situation.\n\nHow about game modes? Well, you have arcade (AB), realistic (RB) and simulator modes (SB). AB is simple, just chaos, respawns and lots of angry children. RB is more strategic, one life and the planes/tanks behave in a more realistic fashion. It's safe to say that RB is the middle ground of this game, the one I've played most and probably the mode that suffers most from the BR compression. SB is total trash compered to other simulator games like IL-2 bos or DCS world. Oddly enough though, SB tanks is good and probably what RB should be for tanks right now imo.\n\nOh, and to finish it off, Bombers/attack aircraft are mostly useless. Bombers/attackers don't contribute to a victory outside of tier 4 (and or spam) and are just exp pinatas. In tank battles though, they're just an annoyance, since SPAA can easily one shot them. Oh and SPAA are pretty damn good at killing tanks. WAY too good in fact. One tier 1 SPAA in fact can drive 80kph and seal clubs everything it faces.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTl;dr: The mechanics/controls are fun and smooth. But the game right now suffers from balancing issues, a company that totally ignores community feed back outside of "Gimmie dis plane/tank, I'll buy it!" and in general, frustrating gameplay as a result. It has a lot of potential and could really go somewhere, but only if the devs stop and listen to the people that've spent thousands of hours of gameplay on this game.","February 9","false","413.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The developers give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about their community, it's extremely Allies biased (forget about playing German tanks and planes !) and from patch to patch they ruin their own game even more. Criticism of any kind leads to a temporary or even permanent ban from the forum, the ingame chat or even the game itself.\n\nThe game is still full of bugs, massive match-making problems, laughable German equipment, massively overpowered Russian equipment (anyone actually surprised about that ?) and a mostly completely brain-dead community. Team kills just  "for fun" are normal, players shoving your tank from bridges, into buildings, into the line of fire etc. is a common sight, and most of the players are obviously from somewhere in Eastern Europe. Now don't get me wrong, i'm definetly not racist, but most of the players behaving like asses and obviously using aimbots and the like are Czechs, Poles and of course Russians. They don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about teamplay, they don't care about shooting their own teammates in order to get some kind of advantage for themselves, and reporting teamkillers, cheaters etc. has NO effect at all. You don't even get a confirmation that your message was received by the "support", if there even is something like that.\n\nTalking about cheaters and hacks: Although the developer insists on the impossibility of using any kind of hacks, they DO exist. Looking on the web clearly shows that, as well as my own experience. Getting killed with literally impossible shots NO human could achieve within the blink of an eye, players shooting you without you even being able to see them and so on. And it's getting worse every day.\n\nThe game itself could be very, very good, but the countless flaws and an incompetent, unfriendly developer who only wants to make more and more money destroy even the small amount of fun you have sometimes when playing against an almost balanced enemy. Gaijin does NOT listen to the community's wishes, bug that have been around for months or even years don't get fixed, or are re-integrated with a new patch. Like so many other developers before them, they continue on destroying their own product because of unbelievable arrogance, stupidity and money greed.\n\nI could continue this review for quite some time, but i don't want to waste more time on it. What i deeply regret is the fact that i spend some money on this piece of ♥♥♥♥ before it went down the drain. But hey, if you're some kind of masochist who likes to get "seal clubbed" by superior Russian equipment which is far away from historical facts, War Thunder might just be your game.\n\n\nReview Update 03.26.15\n\nWith yesterday's patches a lot of mostly useful changes and bugfixes were integrated, actually making the overall gaming experience better than before. Some of the community's wishes were also implemented. The list of changes/bugfixes made in the last few weeks is rather long, so you should check it in the official forum. Regarding only the game , i'll give it a rating of 6 from 10 right now. Sadly, one can't patch away brain-dead players though, they're still around doing what they can to ruin your WT experience.\n\nReview Update 06.11.15\n\nWell, just forget about this game now. With the latest update 1.53, the devs screwed up so many things that you can only laugh about it. Since i never liked flying in this game, i played Ground Forces most of the time. And guess what: With all the changes they made in 1.53, especially the ♥♥♥♥ed up sighting system, the "zoom" which is just a joke, drastically increased costs for crew training, even stronger Russian tanks and several other ♥♥♥-stupid changes, playing GF has become almost impossible. With 1.51, i always managed to get at least 2-4 kills each round (on Tier V), depending on the enemy team's tanks and abilities. With 1.53, i can consider myself lucky if i even get to SEE an enemy tank before i get killed out of nowhere, although my crews (especially those on the German tanks) are very well trained. And of course, there are TONS of new bugs in this patch. And nothing was done about the hackers out there. Gaijin continues their year long tradition to screw up everything, while ignoring the community, not fixing bugs and adding more and more stupid ♥♥♥♥ that almost nobody wants. The only reason why i continued to play this game after my original review was the fact that it was still possible to have some fun with it, but now... the fun is gone. It's become frustrating as hell.","February 24, 2015","false","818.8"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","18","29","2","0"

I've already gotten fed up with being cannon fodders for the pro's.\n\nThis MMO combat flight sim started out fun for me. I've played a good number of combat flight sim's, both realistic and arcade-ish, so I'm pretty experienced with them. This one has good graphics and different levels of realism and numerous control options and a plethora of aircraft to choose from and tinker with.\n\nWhen I first got started, I was flying a late WWI era plane, and so were pretty much all the other players in the matches. Most if not all of us were newbies at this game. At first, it was fun and challenging, and I found myself consistently ranking in the top #2 or #3 spot on my team (this, mostly due to my experience with other combat flight sim's). But after I reached level 3, I started getting thrown in to swim with the sharks - that is, the veteran players of this game - and it got un-fun real fast. At 3rd and 4th level,I found myself being shot down quickly and repeatedly by level 20-40 players. Not only were these players way more experienced with the game than I was, their planes were way better too! I would have to line them up with my relatively slow and jittery plane and fire away at them with my plinky little 7.62mm machineguns, trying to whittle them down, while they could swiftly turn around and get behind me with their faster and sleeker planes and blow me away with just a burst or two from their 20mm cannons.","December 26, 2013","false","11.2"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","18","29","0","0"

The game REQUIRES some sort of payment to make the game enjoyable. If you enjoy watching paint dry, then boy will you enjoy waiting for your tanks to finally research! But have no fear, the waiting does NOT end there, as you need to pay in game currency to train a crew to operate that tank you spent your entire adult life researching.\n\nBut if that doesn't tickle your belly button, then don't worry, I have more good news! Those tanks you spend eternity researching will still never stand a chance against the players you're matched against who seem to be far ABOVE your level, so the excitement of researching a bad*** tank is short lived as you're eiffel towered by tanks 3 ranks above you (or by players who stole their parents credit card to purchase the Pay 2 Win tanks!) This includes having to take 50 shots at a single tank to get a penetration, but if you drive over a rock, prepare to spend 50+ seconds to repair!\n\nBut the GREATEST part about war thunder is their servers. Plenty of PING to go around! The developers must run the game from a shack somewhere on the forest moon of Endor, as you'll find yourself huffing tank fumes from players who killed you before you even loaded the map.\n\nHOWEVER! "If you do pay for premium," your tanks seem to become empowered with the magic of capitalism as you breeze through research....oh crap I ran out of premium already...as their system charges you by DAY instead of the typical monthly payment. Be prepared to install an arcade coin slot to your PC to keep your benefits coming, because the moment they run out, the game progresses slower than an African Sloth trying to climb Mount Everest.\n\nSo grab your friends! (but not more than 3 because they limit your squad to 4 people.) and huff some glue, because the amount of braincells you'll sacrifice lose from doing THAT is MINISCULE to the amount you'll lose to broken physics, monkey run match making and confusing deaths (walls don't wall properly in this game).\n\nI recommend a spare keyboard as you'll most likely bash your face against the keys a few times.","March 3","false","145.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","9","12","4","1"

I really really enjoyed it for a few weeks. Back then there were only planes in this game and since I was a beginner, I could unlock new tier aircraft rather fast without putting money into the game. I did however buy a few premium aircraft at a very 'reasonable price' ('good old times') simply beacuse I was enjoying WarThunder so much and also wanted to support the devs for this increadible WW2 fighter aircraft game.\n\nBeing a hardcore aviation junkie I spent most of my time on the realistic battles. The arcade battles are just way too unrealistic for my taste, however I still do play them alot and enjoy them aswell.\n\nAfter a while I stopped playing WT but after a few months break I came back. This was before the ground forces and the game was pretty much the same as the first time I played. I still did enjoy it very much and there was nothing to complain about.\n\nLater the ground forces was added to the game. I installed WT again and started playing tanks. In the beginning I did not enjoy the ground forces at all, simply beacuse my lowest tier tanks were facing higher tier tanks with proper armament whilst I had a worthless low caliber gun on my tank. I simply could not get any kills. Therefore I lost interest in the ground forces very fast but went back to the air battles again. I enjoyed the air battles very much but this time around I noticed that, particularly the russian aircraft were OP. Maybe this has always been the case? but I did never notice it as much as I did this time around.\n\nThen I bought a steampack where I got some golden eagles and a premium account. I also bought even more golden eagles and bought a ridiculously, insanely expensive premium tank. It literally cost close to 33 euros! For ONE god damn TANK! However I did start playing and with a premium account I enjoyed the game more then ever. Nowadays I pretty much only play tanks because I want to unlock them all. But even with a premium account unlocking new tanks was ridiculously expensive. All the time I have to spend my money on golden eagles to buy lions. This is getting really expensive. If this was a game that cost 60 euros on the steam store, you would save soooooo much money on just buying it once. The prices are insane. They are disgusting. And this is what ruins the game for me. I enjoy the game but its getting way way too expensive!\n\nAnother HUGE problem is how OP the russian tanks are! Just because the devs are russian it does not mean they should make the russian tanks 2x better than the germans. The IS-2 for example! It is ridiculous! It can take hits like nothing else, and it one hit kills the god damn Tiger pretty much wherever it shoots. Same goes with the aircraft as always. This is a major issue that has to be fixed. However I highly doubt that they will ever fix it.\n\nAll in all, the biggest issue with the game is the fact that it is virtually impossible to play without a premium account! I would be fine with that as long as all I needed was a premium account! But this is NOT the case! Even with an expensive enogh PA, I still have to put TONS of money into the game! This is solely a PAY TO WIN game and NOTHING else. Even though I love the game itself I am quitting altogether! I am not going to play this anymore simply because its so god damn expensive!","December 4, 2014","false","105.3"," 22 of 37 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","22","37","0","0"

So much so that for the Luftwaffe and Japanese planes, late Tier 3, Tier 4, and Germany's Me-262, Ar-234, And He-162 jets are quite literally almost unplayable. In tier 4 for these nations, you will commonly see on the opposing team P-80s, F-80Cs, Meteors, Yak-15s, B-57s, IL-28s, and the like. All of these are jets planes from late 1944 to 1951 and onwards. All going against prop planes from 1943-1944 with guns that lack enough velocity or power to even stay on target when attempting to engage these planes, and it's not like they can catch them. These planes cruise at about 750-900Km/ph. Now you may think, "but the axis jets get the same treatment, right?". No, they don't. Me-262s go up against F-86s, jets which were intodruced in around 1953, a full 9 years ahead of the rudimentary and clunky jets technolgy present in the 262, which has difficulty even getting up to 700km/ph in level flight. The He-162 has the same balancing problem, only it has only 2 low velocity MG151/20 20mm cannons, instead of the 262s 4 30mm guns. The Ar-234 is a jet bomber with no guns, and low speed (topping out at about 760ish Km/ph), and yet it is matched up with Meteors, F-80Cs, and IL-28s. Planes that are not only significantly faster, but also have several rather large and powerful guns. This renders all of these planes, the 262, 162, and 234, not only torterous to play, but also virtually useless, despite their historical significance. As for the Japanese planes, they have the same problems at teir 4 as the germans do, only worse due to the low armor present on most of the planes, along with low speed, making most teir 4 matches in a Japanese plane 7-10 minutes of pure seal club favoring the other team. The only saving grace for the balance system for axis players is the Japanese R2Y2 jet bomber. A manuverable hugh-speed jet bomber with 4 30mm high velocity Type-5 cannons. Other than that, most of the other late game axis planes are bunk do to quite possibly some of the worst balancing I've seen since the ACR 6.8 in MW3.\n\nEnconomy: Early on, things arent too bad, but after late tier 2, it becomes that if you get shot down before a match has ended, you end up losing money very quickly, to the point were after a few bad matches, your once baby smooth cool Million has been reduced to a pitiful 300k, hardly enough to afford or train crew for your next plane. To make matters worse, unless in an event, the most one could make during a game on average is usually only 15-30k(ish), making it take literal ages to save or pay for anything in game.\n\nGrinding: Similar to Enconomy, in the early game, researching is pretty quick, and relatively satisfying. You get to squee over getting your shiny new P-40 in only a few short matches, but later on, it begins to take days, weeks, and in the case of tier 5, possible months to unlock the new plane, and thats just to unlock it for purchase. If you don't have enough money, than feel free to cry yourself to sleep while you continue the grind so you can pay for the plane, only to have it immediately knocked out from stock-syndrome.\n\nAll in all, the game has the potential to be something beautiful, but do to the almost blatant refusake to fix some problems shown by the devs, it remains in a rather unbalanced, and in some ways, painful, state.\n\nHowever, Ground forces is pretty great except for the high cost of tanks.","December 6, 2014","false","484.8"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","1"

Yes. My best friend introduced me to it and I got hooked, we played for HOURS just pwning people in RAF planes.  It was brilliant, with wonderfully detailed models (still applies now tbh) and varied gameplay with a challenging yet entertaining game that was just fun to play.\n\nThen slowly but surely they made dumber and dumber decisions, like casualising tank gameplay (Even on sim mode!) Having imbalanced and unrealistic gameplay (Stalinwood and RAF Planes are best, everyone else suffers) making the game a grindfest and making planes too expensive (you have to grind 'silver lions' to repair planes after battle, if you run out you have to grind starter biplanes) My friend gave up about halfway through saying 'this game is just another P2W 'free' grindfest.' He's right, the game isn't as bad as others (No names), but he's still right.\n\nAnd then the team started making outright moronic changes to the game, the dealbreaker for me was when they started to make flags and certain decals in the game cost real life money, apparently because Ukrainians were using them to bully those poor poor Rooshan soldiers who play this game, after takings ze vacations in Ukrop...Comrade Pootings was made of the sad there, comrades. Politics aside, it's just a cash grab. A dirty filthy cash grab. If they really cared, they'd ban Ukrainian IP's or just removed the flags all together.\n\nIt was kinda like my ex GF, she started off interesting, fun and she was pretty too, but then she started to get fat, started chatting behind my back and asking for more and more gifts, I hoped both would eventually go back to the good times, but I knew it wouldn't happen. I knew it had to be broken off. So I unsubscribed from the subreddit, deleted it from the library, broke up with Gaijiin by text and killed and hid my computer under the patio when they started to talk back\n\nBasically, the developers suffered Hanlon's Razor (never attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance). In other words, they aren't EA, but they did make some dtupid decisions that pretty much ruined the game. so I'm writing this review, then I'm uninstalling. Sorry  Gaijiin, you dun goof'd.

The game is cross platform playable on Windows, Macintosh or PS4, which is just friggn awesome! I would still consider this game to be in beta, since they have so much more to add, and bugs to fix here and there. Sometimes, it can take several minutes to get into a match. Other times, you can't get into an arcade match at all. They have also had strange issues with spawning into a match also, where your tank for example will spawn inside of someone else, or you will fall from the sky.

Flight models vary between "incomplete" and "complete," whereby the community will argue that "complete" means 'perfect,' even though they pale in comparison to other sims. The missions that you are put through completely dash any sense of immersion and waste the potential of aircraft that were role-specific. The AI is laughable and deadly at the same time, which I'm sure an experienced simmer would rapidly recognize.\n\nAs such, I totally gave up on it, as well as Realism mode.\n\nThat left Arcade, which for a time seemed a decent distraction of sorts. A game, certainly, and not a simulation. But time tends to bring out the worst.\n\nTiering is broken beyond compare. Not only did they forsake historical accuracy, but "balance" involves throwing grossly inferior aircraft into the same match, and by that I mean there is literally not a single advantage some have over the others.\n\nDamage modeling and/or hit detection is so poor that you are forced to maintain long tracking bursts rather than make effective snapshots. Conversely, there is evidence of some skill or stat-based handicapping which makes even the slightest scratch lethal, whereas other players can take literally thousands of rounds and keep dogfighting. This dynamic is curiously absent from Russian aircraft which use cannons so large that near misses equate to instant death.\n\nManeuverability in the form of elevator authority and horizontal turn rate is also messed up, because radial Gs and therefore turn rate are fixed. This means that there is literally no way to win a turning fight against even a 1 degree per second advantage without the enemy completely fouling up, and, once again, the Russians have the best turn rates at almost every tier.\n\n"Energy retention" is a farce, primarily because of a grossly simplified physics. Heavier objects accelerate slow and decelerate fast, regardless of their momentum. Acceleration is also very linear, as opposed to being an inversed exponential function where you have to fight for the last few mph. When all of that is combined, Russian aircraft which are predominantly made out of 'wood,' even at a stage where they were using 2,000 HP engines, accelerate ridiculously fast, dive ridiculously fast, and climb ridiculously fast. Even if a metal aircraft has a higher top speed, it will take so long to get there that even some biplanes can catch and destroy it simply by hitting their top speed first. At the same time, the ever vaunted I-153 Chaika, because it's "light" and has its horsepower, is capable of outclimbing and outcruising even a P-40 at altitude. Thus the statistics seen in-game about maximum speed and climb rate are effectively Lies, and, yet again, the Russians hold the advantage.\n\nAnd finally, the "domination" game mode which is so often repeated is nothing more than a "please kill us, Russia" festival in which altitude advantage and performance are practically irrelevant. Russians armed with cannons can simply nose up at leisure and plug you with cannons, and it is only through rapid and shameless ganking that you could possibly defeat them under such circumstances.\n\nAll of this begs the question whether or not it was designed to favor Russian players, or if Russian aircraft design just happened to work best under broken conditions. The answer to that will never be known to satisfaction unless a Gaijin employee blows a whistle, which is highly unlikely.\n\nSo in the end, there really isn't much else to say. War Thunder is worthless as a simulator, and is considerably broken as an arcade game. If you play it, my suggestion is to avoid the forum, avoid the fanboys, and avoid Paying Money. It is Not a game I would pay money for, under any circumstances.","July 12, 2014","false","199.6"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","16","26","0","1"

I would have recommended the game 4 years ago when it still had the benefit of the doubt, but now I wouldnt recommend it to anyone.\n\n\n\nMore edits- Apperently, they found a way to screw up the high tier BR even more. F80s and Hortons are now matched up with sabers and mig 17s and late war tanks now must fight the best of the cold war tanks. Random sim mode was deleted and the T-34s were given ammo that they never had. I think im done with this game for a while.\n\n\n\nEDIT- I have been playing the game again at a friends request and I have noticed some good changes.\n\n-They seem to have taken notice to us Simulator mode players and are catering to us a little bit more.\n\n-We now have a somewhat polished version of EC mode that looks like it will be sticking around for a while this time.\n\n-For the first time in recorded history, they actually listened to us and kept the normal sim mode in too. It is nowhere as good as the old sim mode, but at least they didnt make it worse this time.\n\n-They fixed the aircraft rendering at long ranges, no more 1km wide planes when viewed at long ranges. Long range spotting was way better at the launch of 1.55, but this is better than how it was a few weeks ago.\n\n\nIts nice that they stick the occasional muffin in the piles of dog ♥♥♥♥ we get for every patch. Its better than nothing, I guess.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nSuch a great idea for a game that is completely ruined by greedy and blind devs. Here are a few reasons why you should stay away from this slime.\n\n\n* Matchmaking was bad, but they just put a bullet in its head in the last patch. Cold war tanks/jets are now able to fight late war planes with matchmaking that completely favors Russia in every way.\n\n* Zero involvement with the community. Normally, listening to the players and adding what they think the game needs will make the game better. These guys dont even care about the players anymore, they hired REALLY bad moderators for the forums and straight up ban people who dont hail them as gods.\n\n* Plenty of broken promises everywhere. We were told we would have bomber internals over 4 years ago and they still have yet to add a single one. We were told we would get better matchmaking over a year ago and still have to see a single shred of that. They said they would give us awesome new damage and flight models, we still fall out of the sky if our wing gets scratched. We were told the game would stop at 1952, but they are adding vehicles from the 70s because Russia always has to one up everyone else.\n\n* Historical accuracy was thrown out the window. They give Russian planes lower Battleranks so they always play against lower tier planes, this means that 1944 Russian planes fight 1942 and lower German and allied planes. They also like to make Russian planes and tanks WAY more powerful than they actually were\n\n* They keep reducing the armor and power of planes and tanks of the Allied and German forces because they claim that they were just propaganda and they never were that good. At the same time, we are throwing RUSSIAN documents at the devs that show how bad Russian tanks acutally were, and they call it lies and anti Russian propaganda.\n\n* There are plenty of planes that CAN NOT STALL. Most Japanese planes and plenty of Russian planes will not stall, wingtip stall or flatspin in full simulator settings. It is just like flying a spaceship while everyone around you has to obey the laws of physics.\n\n\nDo yourself a favor and stay far away from this pile of ultranationalistic garbage.","March 10","false","34.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

However, issues do show and as you've probably seen from dozens of reviews, Gaijin very heavily favors their country of origin.\n\nCompared to other playable countries, Russian aircraft are usually shown to be cheaper and much stronger while sitting in the same tiers and battle rankings. It can be frustrating and almost seemingly draws you into that mindset that you have to play Russian to actually enjoy the game. I was determined to use American planes as I know them best, but I found it mountingly difficult to do well with any of them and I ended up just moving onto Russian.\n\nAnother issue is there isn't really any sense of teamwork, not unless you join a group or something dedicated to it. It becomes a free-for-all and a lack of cooperation, and especially ramming and friendly fire, become very common. You ask for cover while a pack of Spitfires are on your tail and a bunch of people use the chat commands to say "Never" or "No" as you become sharkbait in the air.\n\nThere also isn't really any way to balance out which matches you play, and as a result the game will stick you into an air domination match with a team consisting of almost entirely ground attack aircraft and bombers.\n\nAlso, while a lot of planes rarely get many updates or new tiers, there are three Russian fighter lists from different manufacturers and a good half-dozen variants of the Yak-9, a plane often regarded as a UFO. Also, Russia has more jets and stronger aircraft than other countries.\n\nHowever, the music and graphics are great (the latter especially, even at the lowest possible settings). It has a good deal of replay value.\n\nI can't say I recommend it. I mean I do in a sense, if you're willing to put up with a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but otherwise you'd be better off with one of the Il-2 Sturmovik games or Birds of Steel.","January 17","false","354.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

But, unfortanutely, this game lacks any form of dev support or care whatsoever.\n\nFor starters, just reading the update posts by Gaijin made me want to delete this game and send it back to the bomb-crater it came from. Literally every other sentence was praising Russian historical documentation and how Russian books were the source of most of the information. And, honestly, I didn't care about that.\n\nWhat kills this game for me isn't that it's a Pay-To-Win game, it's a Free game that's Pay-To-Play. I was just fine in Tier 1 on my very first day, and I really looked forward to a grind and working up to my next tier of tank. I now regret sticking around that long.\n\nOntop of that, matchmaking is the definition of team-stacking, with high-tier vehicles being placed specifically in one team, especially with things like Churchills.

The fact that I'm not able to take out a wing of a I-15 with a Tier III BF109 makes absolutely no sense. The other thing being that the Axis factions become weaker compared to the Allied factions when progressing. Yet I keep playing this game, why? Because I try to cover the facts that the USSR has many advantages over the other factions. Apart from the broken balancing there is nothing good to be said about Gaijin. They keep adding in vehicles without fixing older vehicle issues and don't seem to care about their community.

Overall fun to play.\n\n=New Review, 2016=  All I play at this game's current state is Jets.  Not because jets are better, or more balanced.  That's a total joke.  I can't really think of any plane or tank that has its real life performance accurately portrayed in the game.  Then again, I only play jets.   Jets as in a general term.  I own pretty much the entire US and German air tree, some Russian, and British jets as well.  So I fly F-86/CL-13 Sabres.  Which, are underperforming in regards to their flight models.  Germany also has a GDR MiG-15bis, that does not perform as well as its Russian tree counterpart, the MiG-15bis.  Some could argue that it's Russian bias in a way, as nearly every game I play, Allied pilots scream about MiGs being a 'point and click adventure' and being overpowered.  This is also not true.  Recently the N-37, the 37mm cannon that the MiGs carry ingame, recieved a nerf.  They 'spark' on almost every shot, and fire at a lower velocity compared to its, still relatively slow, previous version.  Getting kills with MiGs actually takes some skill to use, and if the children that only fly F-86 played with MiGs, they'd cry that Sabres are overpowered.\n\nNothing in this game is truly balanced, and there's doubt that it ever will be.  I have been around since 2013, and logged about a total of 4000 hours ingame (played it before it was on steam), and every plane and tank has seen changes over the years. And will continue seeing changes.  Yes, there is a real Russian bias.  You can see this on the forums if you dare to go there, or just ask any player.  But even Russian vehicles aren't IMMEDIATELY overpowered, just because they are Russian.\n(well, maybe in tanks. Russians club anything atm that isnt British, but that's just because as of this post, British tanks are still in CBT, so the only people playing them PAYED to play them, including myself)\n\nI still recommend this game, because it can still be enjoyable, if you overlook all the broken aspects.\nBut flying props is cancer, and jets are completely broken.\n\nHere's to hoping 2016 will help fix many aspects of this once glorious game","June 24, 2014","true","397.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I'm in tier 5 America and have a positive kill death ratio in the P-51 Mustang. To anyone who has ever played this game long enough, you will praise me as your new lord or repel me in the name of Christ. For anyone else, let me tell you why.\n\nThis game has so much potential to be good, but it squanders it in the silliest of ways. So let me just get this out of the way, it is Russian biased. Not even gonna lie, don't have to because I'm in the safe Steam forums where KGB...I mean Gaijin developers can't execute my posts.\n\nImagine this.\nIt's a terrible day to be a tanker, the Germans have a tiger and you have 1 T-34, in real life you win by number advantage. In WarThunder, you win because the Tiger decided to replace it's armor with paper and lined it's hull with High Explosive ammunition.\n\nI can not believe how many times I have been "Ammo Racked" in a Tiger. You can be shot in the tracks, and your tank could randomly explode. How does Gaijin explain? The game is still in developement. That's why when tanks first came out, lets just reduce the listed capabilities of ALL German cannons by about 20% or if you wanna be technical, model it at 15 degree before even regarding what you're hitting, so technically you could hit something dead on, and still be penalized 15 degrees and just be glancing off.\n\nIs this just one case example? Definietly not. Everytime they put new stuff in the game (while completely ignoring existing issues), if it's Russian they just say screw it, raise all of its values from the previous plane, times that by 2, and make it a UFO. If it's anything else, case example the twin mustang, which is litterally a p51 times 2, is actually now 1/2 in value. Instead of making sure that the planes and tanks in the game work well and historically, they add in more planes and with the twin mustang, were too lazy to even code the second engine. WTF logic is that?\n\nLook I'm not going to recommend this game. This game feels like an abusive relationship in which many like me, were given false feelings of love. Frankly the kick that I can get out of this game is winning in a Tiger or P-51 because the odds are stacked so poorly in your favor that its the feeling of satisfaction that I like. If you play for that I applaud you. But for everyone else flying UFO planes and ww2 T-90's, you are so blind to how bad this game really is.\n\nBtw I can agree with many of the other negative reviews, but the positive reviews seem like they are from easily impressed people. The funnier ones are from people who recognize the blatant issues, but still think this game is worth it. I don't, as a WW2 history enthisiast, I have been pushed to World of Tanks. That's how bad this game has become. At least War gaming has a method to their madness.

Now I can't.\n\nI don't have experience with other flight simulators (if you can call War Thunder a simulator), so I can't say whether the game is realistic and uses accurate flight models or not.\n\nBut I can tell you that the game at it's current state is mostly not fun to play, and the developers seem to try to make the game more unfun with each update.\nThere are two main reasons for this: the grind and the (un)balance.\n\nIn order to research a new plane you have to invest a certain amount of research points towards it, which you earn by playing matches. When you finish researching the plane, you can buy it with ingame currency (buying the plane is not actually an issue, as you always have enough money).\nDoesn't sound too bad, until you see the numbers. At the start of the game it isn't too bad. A low tier plane costs around 9000 rp (research points) or less and you can earn at least 1000 per match if you do well. That's 9 games, fair enough.\nThe problem is that rp requirements for planes get exponentially bigger and bigger, while the game only lets you earn about the same amount each game. To get a tier 4 plane (the game has 5 tiers), the Fw 190-D9 for example, you will need 89,000 rp, while you are only able to earn 1200 rp on average. That's about 75 games for one plane, and each game takes about 20 minutes.\nThat means you need to grind for 25 hours for 1 plane. Want to get a jet? Play 500 matches.\nThe game doesn't reward you for playing well either. Even if you eliminate several players every match, and even if you are the MVP, the game will only give you a pitiful 2000-3000 rp at most. It's a little better, but the difference is almost not noticeable.\nOn top of that, Gaijin (the devs) keep adding more filler planes to the game that no one asks for. Those planes are virtually identical versions of planes already ingame, and I can think of no reason to add them other than as a way to slow the grind even further. They could have at least made researching them optional, but in order to advance in the tech tree, you have to research said planes. This means that you will find yourself finally researching a plane after many hours only to find it is the same as and maybe even a worse version of the previous plane. So to get to the plane you want, double (at least) the amount of time I mentioned earlier because you have to chew through a bunch of useless planes first.\nGaijin couldn't care less about this issue, and has in fact reduced the amount of rp earned significantly over the years. RP gain has been reduced over time by approximately 99% (not even kidding) since I started playing. This is also why I have such a large number of hours played on this game, because had it been this way since the beginning I would have quit very quickly.\n\nThis makes progressing the game a painful experience, and it is why I quit playing it.\n\nNow the second issue - balance. This one is a lesser issue to me because I didn't play game for historical matchups.\nThe game uses a system called "Battle Rating" to match different planes together in a battle. A plane's battle rating is supposed to reflect its ability over its opposition (a combination of the plane's armament, speed and such things). Planes with a similar battle rating will be matched together.\nThe problem is that the Battle Rating system makes no sense, and simply doesn't work.\nYou will see planes from 1943 face planes from 1941, and planes from 1941 facing planes from even 1937.\nPlanes that were rarely flown in real life are used en masse in the game against planes that never saw them in combat, and were perhaps obsolete by that time.\nKeep in mind that World War 2 lasted 6 years, and so a 2 year difference is huge. Also keep in mind, that most of the planes that fight aircraft older than them in the game actually matched their opposition well enough in real life.\nThe result is that a large majority of the planes ingame are borderline useless, because at the same battle ratings there are more effective planes, and they are outperformed by their opposition (which probably never fought them in real life). Some planes are mediocre, and some are blatantly overpowered at their battle rating.\nIf I feel like seal clubbing I can just take out my He 112-A0, F2A Buffalo, or almost any spitfire of choice (there are more options) and easily get up to 10 kills per match (in realistic battles) because my opposition simply stands no chance in their planes (of course I'd get next to no reward for this, but I sure would make a lot of people frustrated).\nIn the case of the He 112-A0, the game thinks this plane should be match against biplanes, which simply stand no chance against a pilot who knows what he's doing.\nOn the other hand, the entire heavy fighter and bomber lines in all nations are nearly completely useless. Bombers and heavy fighters are free kills to any pilot who knows his stuff in Realistic Battles (a tiny amount of exceptions does exist). Some fighters are completely helpless against their enemies, while some even a monkey can use and be an ace.\nSimilar problems occur throughout the entire tech trees of all 5 nations.\nSo why do these matchups exist?\nThat you can ask only Gaijin, which if asked would delete your post and tell you there are no such things as balance issues in War Thunder.\n\nThis brings me to the final part of this review, the developers.\nAny of the above will likely never be fixed. The developers' only feedback about the game comes through the forums. They don't read the English forums, and it's up to the community management team to take care of the user input.\nThe way the forums are managed by those moderators honestly gives off a cold war communist regime vibe. Anything that may be percieved as disagreement with the way Gaijin does certain things, or as a complaint about a major issue in the game, is dealt with in a similar way. The post deleted, the poster maybe banned, and if enough people complain about the issue that Gaijin has to address it, they will claim it simply does not exist.\n\nThere are many more problems with the game that I haven't mentioned because I haven't experienced them personally (simulator bomber abuse - no such thing according to Gaijin despite plenty of video evidence, the balance of jet era fighters, the ground forces aspect of the game in general).\nI'm not sure if the developers themselves don't care about the quality of the game, or if the community managers simply do not pass over the feedback.\nEither way, the developers think the game is fine as it is, and keep releasing more filler planes, more ridiculous battle rating changes that make no sense, almost as if their goal is to take what fun is left away from the game.\n\nEverything works perfectly well in Gaijin-land, comrade! (Except it doesn't).\n\nTL;DR:\n\nIf you have a lifetime to spend grinding, and you don't mind the terrible devs and balance issues, play this game. It is free after all. But it's a waste of your time.","October 2, 2015","false","360.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Incidentally, that is the age I suspect Gaijin's lead developer to be. But I digress.\n\nA new server update was pushed upon the playerbase recently, causing considerable backlash due to now nonexistent game balance exacerbated by bugs both large and small the developer has neglected to fix for one reason or another. The playerbase by and large advised against pushing the update immediately after the preliminary changelog was posted about 2-3 weeks ago, citing game breaking issues with balance that would be the result of it. As has been evident for everyone with half a brain cell, that is exactly what happened.\n\nTo shed some more light on vehicles' battle ratings in this game, they are tiered in regards to each other by comparison of player effectiveness. This has led to some vehicles getting hilariously undertiered because they are abused in roles they're ill-suited for whereas others have been tiered so high you're depending on your opponent being cripplingly stupid to have any chance of killing him. I assume I don't have to point out the problems inherent in such a tiering model.\n\nTo add insult to injury, some vehicles were given new ammunition types, ones they never had IRL. This has caused ground forces battles around certain battle ratings to have become increasingly lopsided for any nation that is not Russia as the new ammunition type is much more capable at penetrating angled armor on tanks.\n\nAdd to that arbitrary nerfs to certain vehicles despite the explicit statement about historical accuracy and I can only recommend you do not spend any money on it, at least right now. Maybe things are going to get better once Gaijin has felt the pressure from decreasing income, who knows.","September 26, 2015","false","955.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

No. But definitely some extensive support for the russians from devs, where we get another Yak to add to the pile of 20~\n-No options to opt out of gamemodes, like the new and awful "Air domination" which is one big cluster♥♥♥♥ you don't want to be a part of. Also, odd "Alternate history" matches that really should be able to be deselected.\n\nThis review is just for the Airplanes, by the way.

Back then it was fairly well balanced though did have its issues. However, as of now, 1.55, the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The main focus of this review is aimed at the ground forces, but has some relevance with the planes as well.\nWhen tanks were first released, they were balanced quite well. You could go into a game knowing you could do well, regardless of which nation or tank you picked. Nowadays though, Russian tanks will one shot you, regardless of where they shoot at you, and they will bounce most shots you fire at them. Those shots that do penetrate rarely hit anything vital. For a long time I've defended against the whole Russian bias, but as of 1.55 I can no longer ignore it. A prime example is HE rounds. Russian HE rounds (designed for soft targets e.g. infantry) are about 4 times as powerful as any other country, this means even well armoured tanks will get killed by them.\nWith the release of Brit tanks, we finally had something that could actually kill T-34s, but of course, they have since been nerfed, through either reducing armour, or by making rounds less effective. Fair enough on some of the "updates" they cited sources, however, they have not shown us where they get their data on Russian tanks.\nUntil this balancing is address, I find it very hard to reccommend this game, which is a shame as the potential is there for perhaps the best game of its kind.","February 1","false","138.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Thats the last straw for me and it should be for you guys too! Don't support these money sucking Rusian biases anymore until they change thier ways. Gajin can take my credit card and shove it up thier @$$es.\n\nCation, huge wall of text, but contains the truth. also, I apologise for any spelling errors. Thankyou for your time.\n\nMy Professional Review:\nTo make this more professional, I have been playing War Thunder for over 3 years. I have ssen they game grow up and add lots of awsome features like ground forces and lots of game engine additions. They also added a lot of additions that are either poor or money grabbing scemes like the vehicle research and xp conversion system. And they battle rating which is and has been one of the biggest problems with the game. you might not think its a problem at low tiers but wait till you get to tier 4 or 5, then you will be ripping your hair out every match epecially if you are a bomber player. If they would just sit down and fix the BR, the game would be 3x more enjoyable and might even help fix some of the Russain and German bias you probably heard so much about.\n\nLast, is the Gajin staff and forum moderators. While I give them credit for some of the great work they have done, they completely disregard the community and thier oppinions which is another reason why this game isn't reaching its full potential. The staff always says that if you have any opinions or ideas to make the game better, to go talk about it on the forums. Most of the time they dont read any of the suggestions most of the time unless a post is attracting a lot of attention. If they don't like what the post has to say, they will take it down and ban the author from the forums because I guess they still don't have freedom of speech in Russia. What really irritates me is thier recent actions to the community like thier " Russian Bias Party" joke which while I agree it was kind of funny, was also unproffesional. What really upset me though was thier cash grab with the new tank customization features. After recieving community backlash about charging 500 Golden Eagles for tank customizations and bush camo, which I disagree with at least paying for the bushes. They then stated 2 days later that that was only a special and raised some of the bushes up to 2000 GE.

Had some great ideas to start. So much so  that I've put quite a bit of money into this game aswell. Having enjoyed it a lot.\n\nBut in recent years, Gaijin has gone down the pan. They're not a good company. They censor negative views on the forums, regardless if they're non-trolls or non-offensive. They don't want your views if they're negative.\n\nThey do not listen to community feedback. Overpowered planes in your battle-rating? Until their statistics (Which they never release) say it's OP, nothing will be done about it.\n\nRussian tanks get ammunition that they never used in WW2. But they have it, because reasons. Gaijin claims to be more historically accurate than WoT. Ok.\n\nThere's a whole load of issues when it comes to their BR system. It's been discussed to death, you can find it if you search for it.\n\nGaijin has also in a recent poll, where someone exposed hackers. Pointing them out or something. Their poll was either you let them do copyright strikes against youtubers, or they'll ruin realistic battles. Abusing copyright law to censor. Nice one Gaijin.\n\nThey're not a nice company. They'll get no more recommendations from me.\n\nIf you still enjoy the game, good for you. But I no longer want to support a company like this.\n\nI touch on Gaijin as a company a lot in this review, but it has a lot of negative effects on the game aswell.

The other part was for having the prices of the packs go up during or just before Steam Summer Sale. Not a smart nor respectful move if you ask. Let's see if a negative review hits the soft spot more than a comment cancelled and a thread closed on the main forum to "keep people at bay and show only one point of view".\n\nF2P model:\n\nNot a huge fan of F2P but I gave it a try since I like flight sims. This F2P is not Pay 2 Win but it can get your money out of anger instead of encouraging you to pay for the fun you had (oh and to avoid the grindy grind, but this seems fair enough).\nLike being competitive from the get go based on your skills only? Not in this game, well, almost. I also don't like this F2P model in particular (Riot/LoL is a lot better IMHO but probably won't work in this game), too much advantage if you use some money in the early tiers. Gamplay levels out in mid tiers. After some hard times trying to face paying players at the beginning you can compensate with experience. Just touched a glimpse of pre-end-game and it seems to get there again. Face experienced players and pay to have some advantages (or not be at a disadvantage) with crews that can only be bought with real money. You can also get more strategic choices with planes lineup and some planes (unbalanced in many subtle ways) that will probably get fixed in the end.\n\nHard to be sure because of the many variables but I had the impression that as long as a match is between non paying customers (some hints on how to recognize them, not 100% sure) it's balanced, otherwise you're facing a veteran player or a paying player. In short: money can substitute experience. As I said not a fan of this model but not game-breaking too, just pretend you were against a veteran or pay for the product you're using.\n\nAbout game modes:\n\n- Arcade is quite fun and can be enjoyed without any special equipment typical of the Flight Sim genre, so if this is your case sure give it a try. Less skill based than other modes, just less waiting in queue and more action in game. Badly unbalanced at times. Bomber gameplay broken and game breaking. Matchmaking is questionable at best. If you do good it will penalize you with worse teammates. Some bugs here and there and improvements to be done (collisions, hitboxes and kill assignment) but also positive development on interface features polishing.\n\n- Realistic battles are too much of a compromise to me but this is quite personal, they can be fun with a friend and spending some money not to be at a disadvantage with crews and upgrades. Just a warning for all the joystick users: you have to just go directly to Simulator mode here or might have more fun with other flight games because of the mouse issue (Arcade/Realistic battles with joystick vs. mouse users? If you like a tough challenge...mouse users have a sniper rifle, joystick users have a knife, sure you can win a round or two in Close Quarters Battles...but...err...yeah).\n\n- Simulator: they're apparently shifting from the simulator aspects towards an almost Arcade oriented game. I might be wrong but this is not bad per se. Simulator is tough to get right and is a money sink, also not fun for the big audience. Some really good premises but slow progress on this game mode, mainly due to lack of interest by the server population. Not Gaijjin's fault, they have a limited but good team on that. Just lack of interest in this mode, though I have to admit that most of the simulator crowd bled away in the past months due to this already starting shift in priorities and some game breaking issues not getting attention (bomber's gunner view and sniping precision for example).\n\n\nYou can stop reading here...\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nStill with me? Then probably you're interested in why I gave a negative review...\n\n\nThe game is good. It is fun (sometimes not, but others have to win, you know the 50% win rate rule in competitive games ;)).  Pretty solid server infrastructure. The community is a bit harsh on some points but you can "almost" ignore this aspect and just enjoy the game until...\nUntil the company policies and forum policies gets in. Luckily we have a right to post our concerns on steam, otherwise the impression given by the forum would be quite far from reality for the average joe.\n\nLet me explain better: complaints and criticism are not met well, even if expressed in a respectful and (hopefully) mature form. Plenty of posts cancelled and/or edited. For example my second post on the forum got cancelled, seen happening the same for at least 2 other people in less than 2 weeks. I'm feeling bad about not having freedom of speech but you know, it's an overrated privilege :P.\n\nExample: prices for packs on steam went up just when the steam summer sale started, so they were 1 euro more expensive even at a 25% discount than before sale started.\n\nI just replied to someone pointing out that Gaijin had the power to fix a matter brought up by the Steam Summer Sale.\nLess than an hour later my post was removed and the HOT thread closed with people mocked and insulted by a Senior Moderator for "gambling" on the sale. I mean, who wants to pay more for less? If I know a steam summer sale is coming, I can wait a couple of days to see what I can get. Complaining for a "wrong" policy might have been too much, but suggesting to evaluate if it could be handled in a positive way is another thing. Or at least I thought so...anyway I perceived the price change as a bad move and I expressed it. Result: I was told I "gambled" and "lost"...but my money are still in my wallet and they "lost" 2 sales...not sure who "gambled" here... Want to do F2P? Get it right or beat your community to get money from anger instead...I don't get it but I might be wrong, only time will tell, sure I learned a lesson and I am curious about the future of the company and of the game ;)\n\nTo conclude the review on more game oriented negative aspects, almost exclusively about the Air Combat part of the game, Ground forces are not my bread and butter.\nMany things that can improve gameplay a lot are not top priority (MatchMaking balance, planes' Battle Rating balance, Flight Models and Damage Models) apparently for financial reasons to create artificial shifting gaps that attract money. This is not big news, I've seen masters of this strategy in the last 15 years and Gaijin is just making some experience in the field. If it floats their boat they're right to do so.\nEmphasis on new planes (sometimes with completely broken flight models) might be good or bad, depending if you like a good polished game or a dynamic one with frequent news.\nGrind is a bit tough but can be accepted if you have patience and dedication. Progress is like hitting a wall in the late tiers, approaching endgame, but I admit that I agree with them, if you get there you have to pay for what you got.\n\nHonestly I was in the process of doing so, just thought that with the sale I could buy 2 packs, one for me and one for a friend who played with me up to here. Just got a bad feeling about this. I'm going to buy one pack anyway probably because I feel guilty for the fun I had before. I just wanted to point things out so they can at least see it, I know they don't care but I never lose hope in mankind :P. Other people might be interested as well before committing to the game.\n\nThanks for reading through, hope this puts things in perspective for a game that has so much potential for the Flight Sim genre and for gaming in general.\n\nWolf","June 24, 2014","false","209.6"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","18","30","0","14"

Upon making an account with Gaijin and playing the game, you will discover that War Thunder is actually a semi-secret Russian Program aimed at training and educating future Russian soldiers (and hopefully sympathetic Westerners, too).\n\nWar Thunder has two main gameplay modes: Air Combat and Tank Combat. They are further divided into three modes: Arcade, Realistic, and Simulation. They are described below.\n\n>Air Arcade: Pretend that you’re playing Ace Combat! Get pursued by up to half of the enemy team! Crash and burn! Get mad at your team! Then sulk about the absence of supersonic jets and guided missiles. Pray for a sequel that follows the adventures of the Red Army under Comrade Khrushchev and Comrade Brezhnev.\n\n>Air Realistic: Pretty simple. Take off and then set your plane to climb at an optimal angle. Go take a bathroom break. Have lunch. Run for president. Win the election and get inaugurated. On your first day as president, come back to your game in War Thunder just in time to close in on the enemy. Then get shot down in a pathetic head on joust with an enemy plane. Get cursed out in Russian. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\n>Air Simulation: This is real flight! Real battle! You need a fancy joystick or else you will face humiliation. Other than that, it is similar to Air Realistic. However, you have even more free time between take off and enemy contact. So go brush your teeth. Watch a Rom-Com movie with someone. Write a masterpiece Neo-Greek tragedy. Get money and fame. Give your riches to Greece. Watch your money go to waste as you chastise yourself for not spending it on Golden Eagles, War Thunder’s premium currency. Then spend the last of your money by running for U.S. Congress. Get elected, get money, and serve three terms. After all that, go back to War Thunder and you’ll be just in time for some intense simulator action!\n\n>Tank Arcade: Drive and drift around the battlefield as if you are in a Fast & Furious movie. Then get shot. Crash and\nburn.\n- There are also time-limited air battles. This means that you only have enough time to down one plane and then do your best to impress Michael Bay by performing a fruitless kamikaze run on an enemy tank with guns blazing.\n\n>Tank Realistic: Like Tank Arcade, but with a somewhat slower pace. Friendlies and enemies alike are not highlighted by the game HUD. Therefore, you will have to look around very carefully. Your crew will all die in the process as enemies (and possibly friendlies) pick you off at distance.\n-At least the tanks don’t vanish out of thin air when hiding behind a tiny bush like that one Belorussian game with Traktors and Ducks.\n- If you blow up enough enemies before dying, you can fly whatever aircraft you bring along to the battle. Apparently 100 kilogram bombs can destroy heavily armored tanks like the Maus by exploding a few feet away.\n\n>Tank Simulation: This time with even more realism! Heavy Vodka and Borsch consumption along with Red Army Choir music recommended for the most immersive experience.\n\nNations: You can build up a massive collection of tanks and planes under the flags of 5 different countries – The major powers of World War 2.\n\n>Glorious Soviet Union – Take a step into the illustrious history of the Red army by taking control of some of the most well armored and armed vehicles in history.\n-Stalinium and Stalinwood armor will protect you from most attacks by the feeble fascist aggressors and capitalist pigs.\n-After operating their respective designs, men like Kliment Voroshilov, Nikolai Polikarpov, Alexander Yakovlev, Semyon Lavochkin, Mikhail Koshkin and Comrade Iosef Stalin will all become idols to you.\n\n>Germany – You can now live out your wildest daydreams of serving in the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe or even the Bundeswehr.\n-You will have access to majestic and fearsome felines such as Tigers, Panthers, and Leopards. However, they usually end as big game trophies whenever Kliment, Mikhail, and Uncle Joe are out on a safari.\n-Up in the air, you will see approximately 752.2412 different variants of the Bf-109 and The Fw-190.\n-As you slowly climb your way into the jet realm, things get more interesting. Adorably small, yet vicious rocket interceptors, the first operational jet fighter, and what seems to be a Volkswagen with a jet engine strapped to the roof and wings glued on.\n-At the end of the German line as a Soviet Kadet, you will be fighting misguided capitalist West Germans in their Leopards and their F-86s. You may even go toe-to-toe with some confused East German MiGs.\n-Oh, there are also Italian planes. With FIAT lawnmower engines and 12.7 mm breadstick shooters and 7.7mm macaroni guns to boot. Just don’t leave Mussolini hanging. Oh, wait…\n\n>’MURICA – Make America great again! Just not on Uncle Joe’s watch. Parade around while you deliver “MADE IN THE USA” freedom munitions in various forms by land, sea, and air!\n-Unfortunately, in the realistic realm, half of the US Air Force is tied up over Guam, fighting imaginary battles with the British as the ghosts of George Washington and Charles Cornwallis attempt to settle scores over the American Revolutionary War. The pathetic cover story for this paranormal activity is that it is preparation for the invasion of some big Japanese island. America nuked Japan. Twice. They surrendered. No invasion, bucko.\n-In the rest of the Pacific, American planes get their wings severed by burning Nippon steel.\n-In Europe, Americans fight alongside their Anglo allies to confront Krauts before getting decimated by Glorious Red Air Force and Army in the subsequent Third World War.\n-Otherwise, you will attempt to bring democracy to Korea. The best case scenario is the destruction of the Russian MiG-9 trainer squadrons and lots of dead Asians. The worst case scenario is that you will be shot down and offered as a sacrifice to Kim Il Sung.\n-In any case, if things do go well, hog all the credit and snub those damn Brits.\n\n>Great Britain/The United Kingdom/Canada/England/Australia/Mighty New Zealand/Empire of Britannia/Queen Elizabeth’s Corgi Empire/Winston Churchill – When you get tired of Russian pride, Reich nostalgia, Weeaboos, and American jingoism, strap yourself into a Spitfire or Meteor and restore the Pax Britannica!\n-Just fly around, sip tea, and make snide comments about former colonies, Russians, Frenchies, Jerrys, and Americans. Mow down enemy planes with loads of honourable British .303 or some of the finest Hispano brand Tea & Crumpet cannons.\n\n>Dai Nippon Teikoku (大日本帝國) – Make your famary proud by fighting for the grory of the EMPRAH!\n-Japanese planes boast excellent maneuverability. I guarantee that you will be able to impress your waifu by pulling tight turns in a Zero or an Oscar.\n-Japanese planes have Nippon steel wings that are as sharp as a samurai’s katana. Go ahead, sever enemy wings! Very honorabru.\n-Unprepared Anglo-American and Russian are easy prey for your agile plane and carrot stick tracer guns. Of course, the Russians will usually clip your wings while the Americans will set you ablaze like it’s the 4th of July. You can still die with honor and glory though. Banzai! KAMIKAZE!\n\nBetween the gameplay and wide diversity of players that you will encounter, War Thunder is a pretty interesting game.\n\nSpasibo, Rossiya!\nRating: XAXAXAXA/XAXAXAXA","October 8, 2015","true","387.1"," 41 of 74 people (55%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","55","41","74","45","0"

In aircraft arcade mode nearly every fight is dominated by jets and other aircraft with seemingly impossible aircraft physics.   In tanks you are cruising out looking for prey then suddenly you explode from and exploding ammo load or your crew is rendered unconscious!  So you spend money to get extra crew training points and to upgrade to ace crew and it makes little difference.\n\nThere is nothing in the game to encourage team play, I play this with a few friends and its impossible to actually play with them.  Another player here refered to it as a complete free for all, he/she is 100% right.\n\nHit aim indicators are pretty much useless, especially in tanks.  You get a green armor penetration marker, you fire a shot knowing that the round should land on a vulnerable location then all you get is "no damage" or a complete miss.\n\nDrving a big ♥♥♥ tank through the woods you clip a tree then your tank track breaks -.-  are they made from used condoms and tissue paper?  Vehicle models for ground forces are absolutly nuts.  Russian vehicles are OP, game developer is russian, nuff said.\n\nHistorically the game is way off, if you spend the time and do your research on vehicles you will see what I am talking about.\n\nNow look at both positive and negative reviews!  Positive reviews are for the vast majority from people with very little playtime and only a few sentences long.  Negative reviews from players with HUGE play time and the majority of them are quit long and descript.  I have spent a long time reading the negative reviews, I agree with them all.  1.37 destroyed the game in favor of capitalism.  1.39 did little to rectify anything.\n\nModerators and support in general is TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE, I actually got chastised by support staff in my last two tickets even though they where acurrate, polite and somewhat complimentary!

Greed ruins everything.\n\nSo when I last played this game, it was a fun as heck F2P WWII dogfighter game with an excellent matchmaking system, was not p2w, and was well optimized with great graphics! But then I heard what they did to the game, and died a little. They "REVAMPED" the matchmaking by decreasing the amount of teirs that are sorted by your level, skill, and plane that helps to keep the powerful planes with people of their strength. This lead to said powerful planes (witch consits of paid planes too) to leak into the less powerful planes matches, and causing the less powerful planes to not have a plesent experiance. After hearing that and reading a few of the other reviews which gives a much better and more recent review, I am not happy. This game used to be great, but then they ruined it.\n\nTL;DR I would NOT give this developer any attention or money until they forget greed and fix the system, IF they fix the system.","September 30, 2014","false","9.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Sadly this gets you limited research points not sure why and that becomes a problem, it forces you to use planes you probably dont want to use. for example spitfire vlc has quad 20mm but the game wants me to use a spitfire xvi which has dual 20mm and dual 7.62mm which is worse at everything apart from top speed. Make making is odd because its rarely on point, you either slaughter the enemy or get slaughtered, it could be due to the number of people that are playing it though. By the time you get to tier 4 you have to put in around 20-30 hours to research a plane which is halfed if you waste money on premium. At tier 5 you will need to push an insane 50-75hours for a plane and that extends by 10hours the deeper you go into tier 5 its a massive grind.\n\nTanks however are worse, firstly you get less kills, this means less research which in turn means it takes a lot more time to get a new tank, you are at a disadvantage if you dont have premium there. Afterthat the balance for the tanks is shameful, it comes down to pretty much having your tanks go from epic to paperweights with a minor change to the battle rating system, you arent given that choice and that bugs me big time.\n\nI used to be fine with this because i didnt have anything else to play but once i realised war thunder was turning into a monthly subscription to me i had to draw the line somewhere.","August 6, 2015","false","304.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","2"

Arcade is increasingly unbalanced with premium planes, no one wants to do Realistic because if they go 2fast4u, the wings rip off, engine failures, ammo problems, spin outs, everything real planes are susceptible to, or because Germans get 1-shot by 'mericans. However, if you can look past the fact that increasing imbalance has caused the game to become more "unenjoyable", I beg to differ all of these negative reviews.\n\nFirstly let's start off with my experience. I have at least 400 hours logged from the game before I joined Steam. I've played for about a year now, before steam, so I know what I'm talking about.\n\nOkay. So about the game itself - It's a WWII simulation. Arguably the best damn one out there that is and will be for a number of years. Mechanics in general are great, and you can fine tune your planes (And as of June, tanks) to however you want to have them. There is a higher level of customization in the game than people think - You can add decals, paint the vehicle (After getting all upgrades for it, which is kinda bs but whatever), select what bombs/turrets/bullets you want your plane to use (depends on the plane/tank), etc etc.\n\nPlaying with friends is very easy. Just set up a squadron with them after finding them in the chat. Send them a mail, add them to your friends list, then you're good to go for playing together with them.\n\nAnother thing is that the combat, while steadily becoming unbalanced from how it was over a year ago, is both intense and drawn out. Most of your time will be comprised of flying around actually looking for people until you're ~500km away from them. Ghost Shots can be an issue if someone knows what they're doing and can actually aim without having to use the target system that shows up on your screen. Overall though, when you do get into combat, it can be intense and very fun, and damage on your plane is very noticeable (Look on my video section for a War Thunder intro video, there are a lot of shots where my plane(s) damage is shown).\n\nThere is little music in the game, if any. It is recommended that you just turn on your radio/pandora/personal playlist/MP3/iPod or whatever else you have and jam to your own tunes. Keeping sound effects is optional because 3/4 of the time all you'll hear is the engine sound. The other 1/4 are planes shooting and random radio calls that get annoying ("The enemy has taken the base! We must get it back at all costs!" - No ♥♥♥♥ sherlock).\n\nOverall, the game is very enjoyable if you're not SUPERHARDCOREPVPMUSTWIN. Just be casual about it, enjoy it for what it is and you'll have a grand time on it like I do. Give it a shot and if you don't take it too seriously, you won't regret it.","August 10, 2014","true","52.4"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDapperChangeling/recommended/236390/","TheDapperChangeling","TDChangeling","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDapperChangeling/","221 products in account","TL;DR: Don't play this game. In it's attempt to be realistic, it sacrifices fun. It's patonizing, and teaches you nothing about it's core systems, while constantly telling you how to not crash into the ground. Bad controls, bad gameplay, and just not fun. Avoid. Go play Ace Combat instead. 4/10 (Numeric breakdown at the bottom.)\n\nA truely awful experience. I tried this game while losing a bet, but tried to go into it with the best mindset possible. After all, I'd wanted to try for awhile, and Ace Combat 0 is one of my favorite games. Not the same thing, I know, but, hey, maybe I'll love it!\n\nI didn't. Going in, the tutorials are god awful, meandering around and teaching things in reverse order (Such as telling you to speed up to a certain speed, THEN teaching you where the speed indicater is), and telling you simple stuff. I'm aware this is nessecary, and I'll let it go. After all, what is a tutorial but a "how to play games." (Although, there were a TON of "Yeah, I get it." moments..)\n\nSo, I was let into the game, and it was just boring at it's finest moments. And at all other times, insulting and confusing. The game boils down to "Put the circle over the enemy's circle and win.", but it doesn't.  It kept popping up reminders to "shoot the lead indicator" and "don't fly into the ground." Reminding me of core, simple concepts while I puzzled why my screen was going black, or my gun was refusing to fire.\n\nEven with these problems, I was only downed four times in five games. One was a strait forward victory, but the others were caused by being rammed, either by my team-mates or enemies, or a single occasion was my engine cut out, only to allow an enemy to take off my wing with a single shot, leaving me helpless.\n\nI was later informed that the game, in it's claim to realism, decided to make guns jam with rapid fire, pilots lose consciousness at turning to much, and bullets be useless unless you hit something vital, if they hit at all. While these are interesting concepts, and true to life, they do not make for a fun experience, especially when they are never explained in game.\n\nThe control feels sluggish and sloppy, often wavering dangerously out of control, or jerking to a knife turn with a slight shift of the mouse, when it's not slowly plodding along to get where you want. Again, I feel this is probably due to the game's aim towards realism, but it feels boring, and irritating.\n\nThe visuals are nice, but I don't have much to say on this, as I don't much care for graphics in this day and age.\n\nThe menu's are likely more understandable with time, but I felt confused as I just pushed buttons to go along with what they told me. Researching and buying and equipping weapons, nor crewing is ever explained, and left me feeling confused and upset when I felt no effect. Once again, this is very likley due to my short playtime, but I feel it needs to be much more well explained.\n\nAll and all, it's a pretty game, and for those model plane collecting realism fanatics out there, you may have some fun with this, but not being able to turn the camera to look at your plane will take away from your pleasure of this.\n\nNumerical breakdown:\nVisual: 6/10\nI know nothing about planes, but the ones I got seemed...accurate, I guess? The clouds and the explosions were lovely to look at, but it's hindered by the fact you never will get time to take it all in. I ran the game at high, and it looked very dull and lifeless.\n\nGameplay: 3/10\nI hated my short time in War Thunder. I didn't feel like a bad ♥♥♥ pilot, dodging fire and chasing my enemies down to their inevitable defeat. I felt like I was piloting a cranky hippo, and slowly following other hippos as I plinked at them with spit balls until they fell down out of pity.\n\nUsability: 4/10\nThe UI is competent enough, but due to the lack of explanation on anything important, you'll likely feel lost and confused, at least for awhile, if you don't have someone to jump you in. I gave it extra points because, on High at least, it ran like silk, never a hiccup or slowdown in sight. That in itself is to be commended.\n\nSound: N/A*\nI don't recall hearing any music, and while this makes for a much more realistic experience, it's a boring one. Bring your own music. The sounds, however, are servicable. Bullets plinking off your plane sound like bullets, and explosions go boom, but nothing that makes you feel there. Nothing that feels like a bullet hitting your plane, or the huge blast you want in a bomb.\n*Not rated due to my lack of rememberance on the topic. Utterly unprofessional to not go back and make sure, but hey, this isn't a professional review.","January 17, 2014","false","1.5"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

If you like historical games, this is the place to go. It captures the grip and pace of WWII, and yes, it does take a bit of playing to get the good planes. I've played 130 hours or so, 120 of it being on my British planes, and I'm almost at teir 4. In 20 hours, I researched about 9 US planes.

The planes you face are at many times not fair in any way. I now HATE this game...

It's fairly realistic, easy to learn, and easy to find a game. The graphics are decent and you can change cloud density and ground texture. This is mainly a multiplayer game, but it does offer some single player missions if you can get into it. That's pretty much where the good stuff ends, though.\n\nGiven that it's Free To Play, of course the game starts you out with literally the crappiest planes they have to offer. The planes you see on as the cover art and in the screenshots? Yeah, you can't have those. It wouldn't be so bad if the matches could be ranked. But every time I joined a session, there was always somebody on the other team with a faster fighter plane that takes more hits and can kill you in two shots. Why two shots? Because you're in a ♥♥♥♥ing bi-plane from World War 1 (unless you play USA and why wouldn't you unless you're some kind of commie) and they're in a German Stuka, for example. And no, you can't fly away, because you are slow as hell. So you might as well just crash into the ground and save them the trouble.\n\nTrust me when I say the dogfights that the game hypes you up for aren't as exciting as they could be. It's usually just you being chased or the other way around and going in circles until somebody gets a lucky shot (or crashes) or the 15 other enemy players arrive to gang ♥♥♥♥ you with endless tracers and bullets. And to top it all off, some people in multiplayer matches have come to believe that ramming their plane into yours is a viable strategy, even though they lose their plane in the process. The point is to NOT get shot down while shooting down enemies!\n\nIt is unforgiving, and you will start out very slowly. Unless you have the time and patience like some people apparently do to eventually unlock an actual decent plane, I would not recommend this.","January 17, 2014","false","3.7"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

No.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGeneral Overview:\nA Free-To-Play game aimed at mutliple market generally suffer in terms of game-quality along with many other issues. War Thunder runs great on PC; has a sleugth of options to fit your liking from shadow-blurring, borderless-windowed, to a mountain of adv settings.\n\n\nVisuals:\nThe visuals are absolutely stunning and gorgeous, everything to the models of the planes to the beautifully rendered fluffy clouds.\n\nSingle-pilot planes allow for cockpit-view; where the dashboards and controls of the plane are all visually working, along with the pilot and his throttle plus rudder.\n\nLandscapes are also vast and give you a sense of flight-realism as you’re staring down from the skies. Along with that, weapon-effects from 1000kg bombs, torpedos, and MG-fire are represented fantastically.\n\n\nGameplay/Game:\nWar Thunder supports a multitude of different control inputs natively; mouse/keyboard, controllers, gamepads (With a ton of default profiles for most-market gamepads.) and even Oculus Rift support.\n\nAs any F2P game though however, level-progression is slow and most newbies will likely turn away in frustration after their first hour of constant death. But I doubt anyone who wants to play a game with much depth as this will not-overlook that factor.\n\nWar Thunder has different control schemes from advanced to intermediate but the most basic control method; the one you being with is the Mouse-Control. In most recent memory, or perhaps in my entire gaming history I have never encountered a game where mouse control worked so well; it is incredibly accurate and fluid in its function.\n\nMouse-Control is great; works flawlessly and will do wonders for players who cannot wield keyboards and other paraphernalia as most hardcore gamers can.\n\n\nAs mentioned before War Thunder is a great PC game, in terms of UI, engine and stability; along with options. The developers do care for their game and it really shows.\n\n---\nGameplay is usually revolved around player-controlled airforces and AI-automated fleets and ground armies. Your team has an airfield; which can be defended and attacked; affecting scores.\n\nGenerally mission objectives are either: “Destory all Enemy Players” or “Destory Enemies Ground Troops”\n\nThe outcome of games relies on the mix of fighting between players and the elimnation of AI-troops. Focus on airfield, bases, and troops too much and you’ll notice your entire team had been wiped out. Or waste your time in a 1on1 dogfight; chasing your enemy during the entire match to find that YOUR ground forces are nearly gone.\n\nA game needs a good balance of strategy as methentined but airplane composition is also important.\n\nFighters/Bombers is the general-split classification of the planes, if the enemy team has many high-altitude bombers and you have no-fighters in the high-skies = problem.\n\nThe amount of depth and sophistication in gameplay is astounding for a F2P game, at the same time it is not without some “grinding” and novel-gameplay aspects most are bored with-do exist.\n\n\n---\n\n\nWhether you want to roll down bomb-carpets of destruction with the B17 Flying Fortress, shoot down Americans with the MIG-Jet fighter, or just have relaxing dogfight with biplanes… War Thunder is a great F2P game that should appease to new players and some adv-flight sim players.","December 6, 2013","true","47.4"," 26 of 46 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","26","46","0","0"

Through this time period, the game has had it's ups and downs, and on top of that the game has had its fill of Gaijiin not caring about it's playerbase. I've been at the  second to last tier for most of the time I've been playing the game (using the new tier system) Why, you might ask? Well, I don't have the time to devote the almost two hundred and thirty hours JUST to research, and not purchase, the next plane in line. I don't have the effort to sit back while Gaijiin's official community response to the horrible matchmaking, and substantially increased grind is "It's working as intended, none of the players understand and the blame is squarely on them." Yesterday, I was going to buy premium, OUT OF FRUSTRATION. And then I wised up really quickly, and saw exactly how much it would take for me to get to my next plane. I can safely say that this game will never get another penny from me until they fix their dreadful system. The fighting and the actual core gameplay is fantastic, and in my opinion, unmatched. That being said, the game core that supports you, like earning currency and experience quickly leeches the fun out of the game, leaving it a cold and empty husk of what it used to be. If you're thinking about playing this game, as a longtime veteran that has been watching things slowly go downhill, and the player numbers dwindle, I can only recommend that you wait until the next major patch and see where it goes from there, unless you are into grinding that makes World of Tanks, which is the game that most of us early players were AVOIDING, look like it's a quick progression system. I hope Gaijiin steps up their game, and their attitude with the international community.If and when they do, I would be more than happy to make a new review parading the turnaround. Until that point, I absolutely cannot recommend the game to anybody unless they like korean made grindfests. In which case, we've got a Russian made grindfest right here that you can possibly enjoy.\n\nGood luck, Gaijiin. Listen to your player base when they're screaming at you and dropping like flies.\n\n\nEdit: I've just recieved Jets after all the time i've been playing the game. Again, if you don't already love the game, there's not much in the way of keeping you hooked as far as progression goes.","February 17, 2014","false","151.8"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","6"

Because that's what the matchmaking will do to you.  They have tiers: different levels of planes that follow a semi-chronological order of how the planes were developed and improved throughout history.  But, in matchmaking, the tiers mean nothing.  Have fun flying a bi-plane against a jet.  The matchmaking used to work, but then they upgraded it, and now everything is terrible.\n\nSecondly:\nThe interface is awful.  I hope you like opening menu after menu after menu.  There's no real explanation for anything, and there's a lot that needs explaining (matchmaking, upgrading planes, what the currencies represent, what do my crews do, what does upgrading them get me, why aren't my friends getting my invites to my team, etc.).  The only thing that's obvious is the "start battle" button.\n\nThird:\nThe game is fremium.  It isn't 'pay to win', since there's only so much you can upgrade the planes, and they're minor upgrades anyway, but there's a constant siege of "pay money to not have to grind this."  It's not really a big deal, but if that sort of thing bothers you, then watch out.  Honestly, before they bungled up the matchmaking thing, I would have gladly paid money for this game.  It is fun, when it isn't horrifically broken.\n\nFourth:\nThe chat interface needs work.  Nothing too major, just smooth it out a bit, make it carry conversations from out of game to in game, so I don't have to constantly swap between steam chat and ingame chat.\n\nHaving said that, the game IS fun, when it works right.  When you're not being instantly shot down after five minutes of flying towards some dot in the distance.  When your weapons can actually do something against the enemy npc targets.  (Both are matchmaking problems).\n\nSo.  Until they change the matchmaking system, I'm not recommending this game.  It's great fun.  Stay away from it for now.","January 20, 2014","false","195.5"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","16","27","0","0"

The strategy was something like this, let's not develop anymore aircraft or maps, and let's make it sooooo frustrating and expensive to upgrade/purchase planes with silver that users will have to pull out their cards and pay a premium to do either.  Enjoy your big yachts and party girls.\nDisgusted","February 16, 2014","false","190.2"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","16","27","0","0"

I enjoy it alot! However the developers and chat moderators are at times completely off their rocker.   It's a natural case of pay to progress/win. Premium Vechiles recieve advantages over their progression tree vechiles of the same Tier and even model of vechile!   I'm use to being out spoken on video games I enjoy. Gaijin has a reputation of silencing negative criticism.   Promoters of the game like PhlyDaily are pentalized for giving constructive criticism. They retaliate against his criticism with removing all of his videos off warthunderlive.  Questionable bussiness practices is the bottom line!   IL-2 Sturmovik 1946 will give you all the planes and more. Same realism and it's only 9.99.   I've spent 500+ and only have 1 full tree of German planes grinded.... A year and 500+..  Warthunder could be the best in series. But, They won't stop trying to make money over a good game.   Raising prices on their "DLC" then putting it on sale!  Also know as a crime.    :)  They also sued a man who owns Gaijin.com  .  I'd look else where for the money you have to spend. Lastly! Anti-facism laws mean you can't use ww2 german ace names.

The OP russain aircraft are so painful to play against, it almost literally gives me cancer, if it hasn't already.\n\nThe constant patches and updates with un-notified changes to aircraft models within the patch notes is incredibly misleading - one day you could be flying along fine, then after the patch your aircraft could just fall out of the sky, it's wings could shear off just because you made a 2G roll, your aircraft could blow up just for looking at a russian aircraft.\n\nI would say play the game, just to understand what I mean by all of this nonsense, but I would also say do not even bother with it.  It'll be a waste of time.\n\nThe jets too - well, don't fly any jets that are British or American, because they apparently suck - by the time you get off the ground, the entire russian team of MiG-17s will be on top of you, blowing your team to pieces.  Believe it or not, a Gloster Meteor from 1942 would fly against a MiG-17 from 1952 (for those of you who are not aware, huge technological advances were made in jet engines and aircraft aerodynamics within those 10 years).\n\nIn fact, if you're reading this and you still want to play the game, fly as russians.  Deal out the copious amounts of BS, and make the game unplayable by making everyone fly around in russian op bias AF aircraft.","May 23","false","496.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The developers are iconoclasts with no respect for half-decent free-to-play models or competent community management.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's get down to the more in-depth description of what's wrong with this game:\n\n- Every subsequent patch seems to be based on strong-arming people to buy overpriced premium content rather than allowing them to do it themselves. Progress through tech trees is incredibly slow to the point of frustrating and fun-crushing. It is difficult to grind out new machines (especially at higher tiers) even by the standards of tiered F2P games.\n\n- Balance issues are present from Tier II upwards, most notable at Tier IV and Tier V (especially with Ground Forces). The game is prohibitively difficult to enjoy when the vast majority of battles involve facing off against tanks that cannot be penetrated or aircraft which effortlessly gain energy advantages. Many planes and tanks that see each other in this game simply aren't comparable.\n\n- High tier bombers are Satan's children. Honestly, though, I can see why bomber spam exists. So much horrible behaviour comes about from the War Thunder community because the devs have made it painfully difficult to actually enjoy the game, and people playing it to grind out higher-tier vehicles are obviously going to do unpleasant things in order to make it happen.\n\n- Community management is nothing short of terrible. The CMs who are present on the game's forums are unpleasant and incredibly heavily biased, acting defensively and with standoffish behaviour regardless of topic or criticism. No issues from the playerbase are getting through to the devs because these community managers act as indiscriminate gatekeepers. One of the best things that Gaijin could do at this point would be to overhaul their entire community management team.\n\n- It's not fun.\n\nThat last one hurts me a lot because I used to find it fun, before patch 1.29 where they took it upon themselves to wreck the economy and slow the grind down to a crawl. Progression became so horrible that it's hard to pin down quite when it stopped being fun, but before long I realised that I was playing for the grind rather than anything else.\n\nSo I can't recommend this game. It's a technical masterpiece, really well optimised, beautifully rendered and gorgeous to look at. If you're after a nice visual experience, give this a go. If you like good devs and fun gameplay, give it a miss.","September 27, 2015","false","679.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Due to the structuring of the game, it is often more profitable for players to focus on killing other players, when the mission objective supposedly is bombing the enemy base.\nNow, the realism is where the game falls short, in large part because of the russian tech-bias I described earler.\nFlight models are obviously broken on russian craft, and other vehicles have been artifically nerfed to make the russian ones even better.\nTanks are fun in arcade, but the physics models make them behave like something out of "Girls und Panzer", with drifting being absolutely feasable. So again, if you want historical accuracy and realism, this game isn't for you.\n\n\nI've logged in far more time than is displayed on my steam account, having played the game via the client downloaded directly from their site, for roughly 80 hours total.\n\nTLDR: Great if you want simple, brainless fun. Do NOT spend money on this game; devs are scumbags. Not meant for you if you are a flight-sim veteran and want historical accuracy. Same goes for Tanks; play WoT or Advanced Warfare if you want more realistic tank multiplayer games.","January 29","false","22.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

A lot. However, if Gaijin don't listen to their community, then I'm afraid that this  game will die. The mods on the forums are ♥♥♥♥. If you say there is a problem (battle ratings,ect.) they'll try to shut you up. This is where the problems begin. Gaijin, you will attract more people to this game if you start listening to your community and add in things they suggest. The new vehicles are cool, but there is so much to be done! Me 262s should not be facing Korean War jets, and I'm not much of a fan of the reward system. And don't get me started on battle ratings, they are that bad. Russian Bias? NOT COOL. As much as I like the Soviet vehicles, I don't like how my plane has the strongest armour ever (Stalinium?) and how I have a higher chance of killing enemy players. because my plane fires anti-German Stalinium guided explosive cannon, and I may as well say that Germany are not fun to play when it comes to fighting the Reds.\n\nAll in all, the devs are great, but the forum mods are one of the main reasons the game is going downhill. Gaijin, if you read this, stop for a second and listen to us. Its all we want. There are not a lot of games like this, and shouldn't this game be balanced and fun? As stated before, I love this game to pieces, and I have so much positive things to say about it. But I feel that this is the only way I can get my (and many other peoples) opinions out there, here, without being whined at by 5 year old mods with their heads a mile up their ♥♥♥♥. This game is full of potential, it really is. But for now, its in a nosedive, but Gaijin can pull out of it if they listen.\n\nBut in its current state, I won't be returning any time soon. Its been fun, but all good things come to an end, I guess.","October 14, 2015","false","443.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I joined them in 2013 december. Back then it was only planes and was fairly good. Had its bugs pros and cons but was good. All went to hell with the patch 1.24... and from that on it went only down.. Then came the ground forces. Man it was good. Again alot of bugs but it was good.. you would kill and get killed but it did not bother me. And after every patch it got worse in groundforces. And you could feel the bias towards russian forces. And now it just RussianThunder. Why? becouse russians dominate tier 5, dominate tier 4 ,dominate tier 3. Before the Br spread and change 6,7 was really playble BR. Well you guesed it. Down came the br nerf" it is for the people , to get the tier 5 battles going " oh yeah right... only nation benefited from these BR was russia. There tier 5 beats the hell out of anybody.

You will always and I mean always being one shoot from any possible angle and from your thickest armor.Someone hits your track kills you,someone hits your barrel it kills you,someones shell ricochet of you still kills you, even when someone hits your antenna it kills you.I tried to play more carefull,pay more attention how am i positioning,tried using terrain and building to protect me and still no use.The enemy simply shiiits on my future.When game is about to begin of course is not going to put all players in the same time and you are going to love the invisible ghosts that are hitting and blocking you from blitzing to the capture point.Lets not forget the glorius badass players who took bombers and drop bombs on your respawn point right after you return in game.You could do nothing,you returned simply to be killed and add that repair price who is devouring your silver lions.I dont think I'm going to play this game that much as i used before,simply it reached point where I'm frustrated too much.Not to talk abuot players who never communicate and i mean never. I used to have golden moment where i felt unkillable,godlike,was in top of the list,have 10-12 kills,but now this is just always bad expirience no matter what you do.(ok trolls come on let us hear how I suck how i dont know to play,come on boost your ego,confidence hope it helps you feel superior then rest)","June 2","false","227.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shintsu/recommended/236390/","Shintsu","Shintsu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shintsu/","404 products in account","UPDATED 6/1/14\n\nWar Thunder sounds great on paper, but the gameplay in this game is total garbage. The combat is awful. Since 95% of players will likely just play in arcade mode, if you get someone tailing you - you're done. I've tried every move in the air combat book and nothing works. This makes this the most infuriating game to play, because you can't escape a plane behind you. You literally need someone else to shoot them, and good luck getting help from random players.\n\nThe controls are also terrible. I don't know what sick joke people play by telling people mouse mode is good, but it's awful. You don't have a direct feel for how much you're banking at any given moment and it's very difficult to get the reticle to line up for a lead shot. Most games you'll just spend your time circling an enemy, or if you try for a head on engagement you'll likely be rammed as death by plane collision is extremely common and some try to do it on purpose (Take out a bomber which is hard to shoot down by ramming it). The playerbase is not very helpful, and no one really helps out. You're most likely to be greeted with "lol l2plane" verbatim if you ask questions.\n\nThe Realistic and Simulator modes resolve some of these issues, but the game controls still feel bad in mouse mode. My joystick hasn't arrived yet, but based on comments from many in the community mouse mode is easier than joystick mode so I doubt honestly it will get much better with a joystick. There are far less players in the realistic and simulator modes as well.\n\nBalancing is also an issue. There are some entire nations which perform far below others. Most players would say to play Russian and British planes and avoid Axis planes because they're not too good. At the starter tier, the Chaika a soviet plane is the most decried overpowered plane in the game. A high turn rate, biplane which fires 4 deadly cannons at a very rapid rate which can quickly take out the other planes at the tier and even many that are higher than it. Matchmaking will suddenly ramp the difficulty up for you significantly and start introducing you to many bombers and fighters as well as many strong ground targets which need large bombs to take out. At this point, you have nothing but light guns to shoot at ground targets and light bombs. This means you'll be forced to slug it out with the stronger planes, which you will likely lose to since they have superior guns. The overall process of getting to your next plane is very painful and doesn't feel well implemented. There are many things you can research, but the game presents them in a haphazard way that doesn't make much sense. Some tier 1 planes can't be researched, but then others can and after a random other plane is researched then a new one can be researched that is in no way related. The game's research tree is confusing, as much of the rest of the game is even to someone who knows what to look for.\n\nI spent a fair amount of time trying to give this game a chance, and it's just the most frustrating game experience I've had. Wouldn't recommend at all. If you're looking at this compared to Wargaming's games, this is way more pay to win model as you don't get any free XP (RP in this game) and with the premium currency you could easily skip up to a higher tier plane. I have played maybe 50-75 matches and I have 50k free RP that if I spent premium currency on I could unlock probably a tier 3 plane (The game has 5 tiers with multiple planes within the same tier). This game strongly rewards those who spend money, far more than a Wargaming game and it will likely prove frustrating for a player that's not hardcore into air combat and is honestly not that satisfying for someone who is interested in air combat given realistic and simulator modes are the modes you would want to always choose. A sidenote about those modes too, the matches are very long. The timer for realistic matches (More realistic than arcade but not as hardcore as simulator) is 60 minutes, to the generally 15-25 minute timer for arcade matches. The arcade mode to me just feels very off, and the difficulty curve into the realistic mode is much higher which makes it more difficult to grind for your next plane.\n\nUPDATE\n\nSo I've heard about the ground combat. I decided to try it out and see if that was any better, of course World of Tanks is the first thing to compare it to. You start out in a lowly tank with a weak gun, but you face similar tanks and all is fairly fun. Arcade mode numbs down the difficulty a bit too much since you can immediately see where the enemy tanks are even if they're in heavy cover. Realistic mode is a bit too punishing though. Unfortunately if you're moderately decent at all, you get up-tiered because of your skill level very quickly and then you'll be facing off against tanks you can't hurt. So you'll find yourself cornered on maps, with no teammates (team work in this game is somehow even more non-existant than World of Tanks, likely due to the large maps and spread out goals). Often times flanking the enemy tank and shooting the rear doesn't even work. After a dozen matches of losing and being wiped out, with minimal XP gains, I just gave up again. You also get to worry about planes bombing you at any moment, as if the overpowered tanks you can't hurt aren't enough.\n\nGaijin is never going to improve this game, clearly they've decided they want their game to be this "realistic" game that they won't back down from. Once again, realistic mode is far more sparsely populated than arcade though - and I think this is a huge mistake. Arcade mode is basically what World of Tanks is, though it has more enjoyable gameplay. War Thunder's ground combat is sloppy and feels like a mess. This game is a pretty big download and an even bigger disappointment for all the hype it receives. If you want ground combat, stick to World of Tanks (though I can't honestly recommend that anymore, teamplay is so awful there that matches are rarely fun anymore). We're sorely lacking a good game in this space now, but the choices are to make do with Gaijin and Wargaming's very mediocre games or do without. Frankly, I'd rather do without - these are just exercises in frustration and time wasting.","January 12, 2014","false","36.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Now? I cannot reccomend it, more and more changes are made without being published in the patch notes, and more and more the game gets grindier and grindier, as well as less and less fun.\nThe developers are outright ignoring community input at this point, and make changes that make the game less fun to play, then turn around and cite statistics that they refuse to show as their sources for whether community approves or disproves.\nI and many others are sick of it, as more and more vehicles are made premium that really shouldn't be, and there is such a focus on increasing the grind to increase incentive to pay that it is utterly ridiculous. I cannot stand the attitude of the developers toward their playerbase, nor that of some of their moderators.\nWhen I play a game about planes, I expect them to either be UFOs or somewhat realistic, and War thunder can't seem to decide between being a fun, instanced representation of ww2 and korean war aircraft and tanks or being a game about spaceships. There are so many arbitrary, unbalanced differences between vehicles and nations that it has lost fun.\nIndeed, many planes, despite having similar armament and turning radius, are made completely inferior for no solid reason, in arcade, where every plane has boosted stats.\nThe so called 'realistic battles' are even worse. There is no incentive whatsoever toward teamwork, or really toward anything but furball dogfighting.\nI'm sick of it, so I'm saying goodbye. There are just too many frustrating things about the game, and it's only getting worse, unfortunately, thanks to the closeminded developers, the only way for the discontent to get through is for players to stop playing.\nThe developers appear to have no interest whatsoever in keeping players around, instead focusing on bringing more players in, resulting in a high turnover rate. The only reason I stuck around as long as I have (since patch 1.27) is because of the time and monetary investment.\n\nHaving a lot of new players come in is good and all, but not when it is by ignoring the issues in the game in favor of upgrading graphics and throwing shiny crap in people's faces. Games that do that tend to have no staying power, and end up falling into memory withing 2-3 years. I have the feeling that the only reason War thunder is still so popular and not terminal is because it has no real competition.\n","November 6, 2015","false","366.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I have put so much time into liking this game, but the redeeming qualities don't outweight the cons of this game.\n\nSo, let's begin.\n\nMy first major pain point with this game is the dev team. They've pulled some pretty great things out, don't get me wrong. The game looks great and /sometimes/ runs well. Then you get times like when Ground Forces was first released. Back then you can turn almost all the foliage off. This took them over a year to fix, and that's after they stopped waiving it as "Normal competetive play". The second thing is balancing. Holy crap is balancing bad. For instance, the Valentine MK 1, in the British armored tech tree. You're only driving it to serve as points for the enemy team. Your armor means nothing, you have no mobility, and your gun is awful. That's just one example of tanks that are not worth driving because they're overtiered.\n\nSecond point, the community. While the community has good points as well, there is a lot of bad to sift through to find the good. If you make any complaint at all, you will be bombarded with insults. If you ask for help, you will be bombarded with insults. Don't like a certain tank? Guess what? More insults. You'll be lucky to find meaningful conversation or anyone who's willing to say anything other than something concerning your mother.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin is when I opened up Warthunder at the time this review was written to find that the update released today severely broke resourrce management in the game. My computer has 16GB of RAM. Warthunder was using 12. I'd never seen my RAM maxed out before.\n\nConclusion: It has ups and downs, mostly downs. If you're willing to ignore the community, you might find something of value in it.\n\nNOTE: I mostly played ground forces, I didn't like air and was kinda trash at it, so your milage may vary if you play it for air.","April 6","false","007.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

At 918+ hours I can say it is a true pay to win game.  I do not recommend this game unless you are willing to spend a couple hundred dollars or more on upgrades so you can at least have a fair chance against the other players who have  crews and or gear that can only be purchased with real money.  There is nothing wrong with using real money to buy stuff in a game but, when it comes to paying for XP so that you can lvl up your crews for the needed bonuses it adds up to a ♥♥♥♥ ton of nickel and dimes.  You will earn those same XP during each match, but at the rate of around 10 to 20 xp.  It takes several hundred if not thousands of xp to train one of around 25 skills (in Tank battles).  Good luck earning XP by just playing.\n\nLong story short, this game sucks for PVP because of pay to win.  But is the best I have seen in a while for what I call eye candy (realistic looking models and FX)  and in single player mode, you can really take the time to enjoy what the game has to offer.\n\nPS.

Unfortunately Gaijin thinks there is no such thing as to much grind, and boy are they wrong and there game is an example of it.\n\nOver all warthunder is a good game it plays well the models are good and even the player base can be kind and fun at times, and that is enough to hook some determined players that are not looking for an easy (pick up and play) game.\n\nThe sad part is Gaijin fails to help its long term players by giving them new things (I'm not talking about updates, I'm still talking about the grind). As a player who is early to mid tier four with ground forces in every country but the USA I can tell you it gets boring very fast. The income of fun new tanks and parts grind to a halt and now you are stuck with bad and boring tanks trying to just get one kill a match. No parts no silver lions no RP, NOTHING!\n\nThis is why War Thunders long term player base is slowly vanishing, if it was not for me now having fun with planes I would be long gone my self. I mean I love warthunder but this love has been tested in the past months with a large demand of hours and matches to get any thing decent or even have fun.\n\nThis would be a VERY VERY easy and quick  problem to fix (along with the br fixes) like one week tops. But that would mean that Gaijin would lose that 50$ they make from high tier GE purchases and we would not want that would we. In Russia every ruble counts! xaxaxaxa!\n\n\nSide note: If War Thunder fixes this ill stand behind it 100% again, but its just to much. War Thunder is not longer fun, its a chore.","May 27","false","438.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Which one you choose if you're looking into World of Tanks/Warplanes or War Thunder is your choice.\nHowever after playing both for a good long time I'd like to state that War thunder offers a great variety of things to do and possible some things that WoT/WoWP doesn't.  Have a comparison:\n-While WoT/WP has more tanks available War Thunder clearly has more variety when it comes to aircraft as it features bombers/dive bombers and other craft as well as nations not covered by WoT/WP yet.\n-War Thunder does NOT sell premium ammunition making players that invest in that slightly stronger.\n-War Thunders tier-system got changed from 20 to 5 tiers and a lot of work went into the game to maintain a good matchmaking balance (no invincible tanks/aircraft cause of uneven tiers.) However it seems to have infuriated a lot of people as progression seems slower compared to how it was before.\n-War Thunder does offer players coop pve missions and rewards you for playing those as well and it also features a variety of tutorials!\n-War Thunder lets you customize the paint of your tanks/aircraft and apply stickers to them without charging money for it.\n-War Thunder also offers you advanced settings like realism and simulation matchmaking which change the hud and other gameplay aspects (in terms of planes even the controls and things like wind resistance etc) to make the game feel like a simulation, though players wanting a more arcade'y experience get that as well in the standard arcade mode.\n-World of Tanks/WP mostly due to the earlier release id say offers a bigger competitive scene than War Thunder though might be subject to change in the future.\n-World of Tanks/WP gives you more detailed information in battle like hp bars, tiers (needed due to multitier battles) and lets players mod their ui. (Not sure if War thunder lets users use ui mods)\n-War Thunder's normal games are more Objective based and let players respawn a limited amount of times wheras WoT only gives you one shot at achieving your goal (games often end due to one team getting wiped out rather than objective victories)\n-The game engine that War Thunder uses is a lot prettier while maintaining a more stable framerate than World of Tanks (it also contains a at least evenly advanced physics engine)\n-At last I'd like to note that while World of Tanks/WP are seperate, the goal of War Thunder however is to implement battleships just like Wot/WP but also combine all 3 forces. Currently as theres only tanks and aircraft available those will be matched together. So ground vs air via flak tanks and air vs ground with dive bombers/heavy bombers is going to be a thing.\nIn  the end War Thunder according to the developers will try to aim for a more open world experience in which ships , tanks and aircraft will battle over control in a world domination kinda mode. It will likely be a long time till that happens but it shows that they have a pretty solid plan for the games future.\n\nI hope those facts helped you decide what you think is best for you and enjoy the game. ^^\n\nPs: I spend over 400 hours in War Thunder and used the non-steam client for a long time.","May 20, 2014","true","157.8"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","21","37","0","9"

If you've never heard of this game look it up in the Steam Store. The hisorical accuracy is also excellent (e.g.)  panzer 5 can't be destroyed by t-70 unless you hit a ammo cache; and you cant damage speed unless you hit suspension, tracks, or come up behind the vehicle and hit the engine. It also exclude some countries from having tanks, because, honestly, do the japanese have any noteworthy and non-tedious tanks? There is also a plane mode with torpedo bombers, dive bombers, and fighters.\nObviously, since it's free to play, There is a non-skill earnable currency. And, friendly fire is hardly given any punishment. People online will ram, annoy, and shoot you even though they are on your team. I was banned even though I as defending myself from a friendly killer. He relentlessly tried to murder me but I  had superior tank designs. He was'nt banned but I was.\nFor 6 days. 6 days later, the ban is reset, for no apparent reason. I restarted my computer and War Thunder, NOTHING.\n\nIn short, if you cantolerate serious crap from "friendlies," Random and unjust bans, and horrible currency functions, by all means, by it. But if you're like me and want to kill the moderators PASS THIS GAME.\n\n","August 24, 2014","false","375.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

You have an enormous amount of planes over various nations with let you play in a lot of different ways. Bomber, Dive Bomber, Torpedo Bomber, Fighters, Attackers, Jets [...].\nThe matchmaking is okay, depending on the game mode you are playing. You have the choice between Arcade, Realistic, Simulation. The names indicate how realistic each mode is.\nA huge flaw however is the huge grind it takes once you reach slightly higher levels. The sheer amount of planes which you need to research to reach a new tier is insane!\nI would still recommend this for casual players.\n\nThe tank part is incredibly bad. Many problems with it were addressed during the closed beta, but were never resolved. The Dev's were spamming unnecessary updates for stuff that did not need to get fixxed. While they tried to be realistic they went overboard and got too realistic. Tanks being able to fire rounds which were incredibly rare during WW2? Hey, doesnt matter, lets fully load them with it! Now every tank is gonna be a one shot easy kill. Bugs over bugs made this hugely anticipated game mode unplayable.\n\nOverall i do not recommend this game. The grind is just too strong and the overwhelming amount of bugs and problems within the game is too problematic.","January 13","false","242.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I'll do it a bit different this time and look at what the game actually is rated: 85%. Does this game deserve 85% rating? No.\nThere's still plenty of good in the game, but here's why this game isn't worth what everyone seems to think it is:\n\nRussian bias: This is more of an opinion, but MANY people share it. Russian planes, in arcade, are simply too good (ie: too low of a BR).\nProgression nerfs: They've happened, more than once. Way to milk players for money gaijin.\nPremium-cost doubled: Guess what the most cost effective method of premium days used to be? Buying 1 day for 100GE whenever you liked and grinding it out all day when you had time off to. Guess what it costs now? 190.\nStale mechanics: There are no mechanics here that perk my ears after a couple hundred hours. Games are "blow up units and shoot planes to win". Ground battles though? Capture the point. Literally the exact same as World of Tanks, only now there are 3 of them...whoop de do. Either way, actual grinding in the game consists of killing as many players as you can within the shortest time frame, just like world of tanks.\nPay to win?: This is mostly gaijin's fault for deciding to make every unique plane with no good comparison premium-only...Nonetheless, XP-50? Thing climbs ridiculous and has two of the best cannons in the game, nose mounted to boot. d520/521? These things turn ridiculously, and had totally broken flight models for, at least, some time, paired with another nose mounted cannon? You guessed it, no comparison.\n\nWould've given you a bonus screenshot, but that is a bonus in and of itself!

Also, the 1st tier tank battles were just fun, drifting with BTs. It's the only tier where the most players were willing to actually move and play the game as intended.\n\nBut the game suffers from being a modern multiplayer popamole full of unlockables, ♥♥♥♥-tiers. Combined with a typical multiplayer community (the plebs) and with a funny elitism element as an icing on the cake the multiplayer experience is just toxic because of the game design.\n\nLater (around tier 3) it turns into a boring grind for unlockables and TANK RESEARCH (first 10 battles with new tank just suck, because it can't do anything and gets wrecked in the first minutes). When heavy tanks appear, the game changes into a boring camping fest, where the game is won by the team who gets 4 or 5 players that are willing to move their ♥♥♥ to capture zones. Air battle events? Bah, everyone wants to enter them, but instead to contribute, they want to go kamikadze or throw bombs at an empty field.\nTank maps are few and between and all of them are insanely boring and badly designed. No wonder so many people want to camp, if you can actually shoot at the enemy spawn point exits from the other side of the map? Good thing they prevented to throw artillery strikes at them at least. That would be just bizzare. On the other hand, it's still possible to just drive into an enemy spawn with some other people and wreck a session entirely.\nRealism? Yeah. No. Although the visuals are really neat, the gameplay is just another arcade where the more expensive shells are just plain better. Now, farm few hours for them to do anything with your newly unlocked tank. They're trying to implement realistic damage mechanics, and maybe they did achieve that. I don't know, I'm not an expert on military. But when you pull it too hard, it's bad for the game. Especially if it's 100% multiplayer with a complex, huge unlockable trees that take forever to unlock.\nSure, there are worse unlockable mechanics out there, but they're just wrecking multiplayer by their definition. Well, gotta milk them F2P.\nBut the nowadays player base buys that. This is the reason TF2, Dota, Hearthstone are so damn popular. Because they approached the plebs target perfectly, throwing them a classic carrot on a stick. This is what most today's multiplayer games are: a carrot on a stick, a clever man hypnotizes his mule. People don't play to enjoy them - they play them to unlock more "cool stuff" that gives them adventage over others, rinse and repeat - persuading themselves that they enjoy it.","March 24, 2015","false","35.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

THE HOURS ARE INCORRECT. ***\n\nAs a life-long fan of aviation, This is of course right up my alley for a relaxed game, it's fun to play, especially with friends. And I believed the intial concept of War Thunder to be perfect, unfortunately, the beta progressed, and it began to show it's FUNDAMENTAL flaws. Mainly being jointly the developers and moderation team, especially in areas such as decision making.\n\nThe developers will happily break something to change the game, and 'accidentally-on-purpose' increase the performance of something and then put it on sale for a while. So, so shameless. The moderation team, are truly exempt from rules, although they like to say that they're bound by their rules too, it looks good but it's not true. The people who hold authority over them speak Russian, in Russia. They trust that the English speaking staff will manage things accordingly, but that trust is misplaced. It's ran with a very "You'll do as I say or else" atmosphere, Speaking out against their decisions results in a punishment, voicing an opinion, first-time offenses, and if they dislike you, they'll go out of their way to punish you. They particularly hire moderators that like to throw their weight around, watch general chat for a while, you'll see what I mean.\n\nThe overall direction the game seems to be going in, is very + and -. The developers don't seem to review what we tell them directly is bad, yet force it upon us (20 Tiers to 5 Tiers ahem) Oh and that annoying self inverting camera angle. The USA seem to have it easy, probably because they pay the most. It wouldn't surprise me, these guys are shameless. Although I still have hope for this game, I must rate it negatively, this may change if THEY change.. But that's the problem. Until these catastrophic issues are resolved, I strongly advise you to play other games... Whilst we all hope that they get their @#!$ together.\n\nAnd yes, I'll speak out against their power abusive ways here because I can.. Or can I?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/recommended/236390/","Yureina","Yureina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/","463 products in account","War Thunder is a massive MMO combat game thing where you take WW2-era aircraft and tanks (eventually ships) into small online matches against other players where you try to complete map objectives, kill your enemies, or just die horribly because you don't know how to fly or drive. Fun!\n\nThis game shares considerable resemblance to the games made by Wargaming, namely World of Tanks and World of Warplanes. However, Wargaming's products tend to be very "arcadey" in their gameplay, require an obscene amount of grinding, and seem to be heading into the direction of e-sports. And while it is true that War Thunder also requires lots of grinding to unlock the best toys and has tournaments of its own, it also leans more towards realism than Wargaming's products, for better or worse. The mechanics of grinding to unlock new vehicles and upgrades for them is shared, but while World of Tanks forces you to play mediocre vehicles like the M3 Lee or Jagdpanzer IV to unlock the much better M4 Sherman and Jagdpanther respectively, War Thunder allows you to get experience towards unlocking your next vehicle of choice regardless of what you choose to use. In other words, you can use the F6F Hellcat and gain experience towards unlocking the F4U Corsair, B-25 Mitchell, or even stuff much later in the research tree like the B-29 Superfortress and F-86 Sabre. So in short, War Thunder is like World of Tanks/Warplanes, but with less BS, less moneygrubbing, and far less vehicles that saw no combat or never made it off blueprints.\n\nTo answer the biggest question all people have about free to play games: No. War Thunder is not Pay to Win. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either a troll, an idiot, or a fanboy of the competition. And while you can spend money on War Thunder to increase your experience gain or to buy special vehicles, none of this feels like "must haves" as Tier VIII Premiums do in World of Tanks when credit income starts becoming a severe problem in the light of rising repair costs. Some things will take a little longer, but you can easily get by in War Thunder without spending a dime. And besides, there are plenty of awesome vehicles to use in the early parts of the tech tree, so it won't take long to get to the good stuff. :D\n\nSince the game is Free to Play, I feel as if there is little more I ought to say here. If the idea of a game where you can fly around planes or drive tanks and make people explode sounds appealing, then go ahead and give this a try. Who knows? You may end up having lots of fun! :D","March 12, 2015","true","626.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

As a result the new progression system has proven to be 4-5 x slower than it was previously to unlock the same amount of aircraft in the higher levels.\n\nThe result of all of this is that the developer has essentially covertly thru this patch increased the price and devalued their in-game currency (GE-Golden Eagles) by 4-5 times what it was pre-patch!!!\nSince it is a F2P game, it essentially means that if you decide to buy a monthly subscription it will now take you probably 4-5 months longer you need to subscribe than previously to unlock the same amount of aircraft.\nAnd I am not talking about a just a few hours here....it will now take you literaly hundreds of hours more to unlock the higher level aircraft.\n\nFor newcomers who are joining after patch 1.37 you will of course not notice any of this as you have nothing to compare the current pricing and progression but just be warned that this could happen again. I would not trust this developer again!\n\nAs a customer who bought a steam pack with a subscription and a lot of GE in-game currency before the new patch I feel totally ripped off!\n\nGaijin of course has the right to change their prices post-patch. It is their own risk or reward decision. When it comes however to devaluing the in-game GE currency for people who purchased prior to the patch at an advertised rate it is downright unethical what they have done.\n\nI have stopped playing this game as a result and I guess will never use my GE left on my account unless Gaijin makes a total turnaround and admits thier very questionable business ethics and turning their backs on previous customer base.\n\nI have lost total respect for this developer Gaijin for this and also after many people complained on their website forums about these changes and posting proof of that the new progression system was falsely advertised and the currency de-valued, they simply deleted and ignored posts.\n\nThe WT moderators here on Steam also delete any posts which are in any way critical of these very questionable business ethics of Gaijin. I've never seen such kind of crazy censorship towards their own customers as I've seen on both the Gaijin and Steam War Thunder forums in my life.\n\nI really feel this developer should be blacklisted from selling any further products on Steam unless they offer some compensation to their customers who were caught up in this scam of suddenly overnight de-valuing their in-game currency that was bought previous to the patch.\nREAD MORE Posted: 31 January 2014\nWas this review helpful?\nYes\n\nNo\n","March 19, 2014","true","0.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

The matchmaking is no longer based upon the tiers, but by the individual aircraft's Battle Rating. As for those complaining about damage models (sparking), the low velocity cannons they are using sometimes bounce (spark). Quick fixes after 1.37 significantly smooth progression. After 1.41, Ground Forces have been released. Currently, as of June 4th, 2014, only Soviet and Wehrmacht tanks are available (and still not the full tree). The devs have stated that they are focused on fleshing out tech trees for OTHER countries before finishing the current tech trees (along with the possibility of completely new trees, such as French or Italian.) My only complaint is that currently, people running computers with enough power to be used at NASA still turn grass draw distance to minimal, along with particle effects, just so that they can get the edge in simulator battles. I'm fine with those who can't run those settings with their current potato. Even I get the occasional studder on the Kuban tank map. As for pay to win, it's more like... Pay for less grinding.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SandmanEnterprises/recommended/236390/","SandmanEnterprises","Shadow Hunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SandmanEnterprises/","89 products in account","This tank/warplane simulator is definitely one of the best out there and, without a doubt, I can say that I'm in love with it. Gaijin Entertainment has certainly beaten its Wargaming counterpart - World of Tanks - with this simulator and I will tell you exactly why.\n\nI - HEALTH SYSTEM\nThere is no such thing in this game. You don't see no health bar that shows you how much damage you've taken or can still take, what you do see, however, is your tank's status. You can clearly see each part of your tank, like the tracks, suspension, engine, fuel tank, ammunition, turret and individual crewmembers. There is no way to destroy a tank just by shooting its hull continuously in areas you can penetrate (like in World of Tanks), but you can effectively disable a tank by shooting its engine, fuel tank, ammo rack or by knocking out its crew. The last option really pisses people off for a reason.\n\nSame goes for air battles. Your plane can get knocked out when it gets damaged just enough that it can't stay airborne, or when its wings are clipped entirely off. Or the pilot is killed.\n\nII - PROGRESSION\nWhile progression can be quite slow, it's generally fun and more rewarding than in World of Tanks. Why? Because it simply has a lot of things attached to it that are worth the grind! Namely, the more you earn experience, the more you can use it to upgrade your tank's modules, like, add fire extinguishers (which are free), add APCR rounds (More penetration at the cost of damage, also free), improve gun stability or your tank's turn rate which is a lot of fun. Sure, progression speed is based on how many kills you can rack up per match, or how good you perform (assists count too, and they count for a lot), but in general, it's fun and rewarding.\n\nIII - CUSTOMIZATION\nCustomizing your armored fighting vehicle is free! You don't have to pay real money to attach a flag or a symbol, or some text to your vehicle, but you do have a limitation. You can attach two things at the same time, while, if you pay, you can attach four things on your vehicle. Customization options include camoflage, world flags, numbers, sentences that tankers used to write on their tanks back in WWII and a lot more. To unlock certain pieces to paint on your tank, you need to complete a few challenges. When you complete those challenges, you're free to paint on that text or symbol that you've wanted to attach for a long time!\n\nNote, this is just a small review for the game and it's prone to editing, but overall, I recommend this game to EVERYONE who wants a good World War II tank simulator. Forget about World of Tanks and its grind and unfairness, War Thunder is the best WWII sim ever and for now, the best tank sim (Until Armored Warfare appears, anyway).","January 18, 2015","true","087.3"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","14","24","0","7"

The planes are a wonder to fly in and make you want to stick with it and learn its strengths and weaknesses.

Developed by Gaijin Entertainment, it started off as a World War 2 air combat game, but has already added tank combat, which this review will focus on. Just like the Aircraft mode all the vehicles are from World War 2. If you’re familiar with tanks from that era, or play World of Tanks then you’ll recognise most if not all the tanks.The game play, just like the aircraft mode, is based around capturing and holding territory. Think of it as one big 15 vs 15 king of the hill match with tanks. Each team has a health bar. If one team has more captured territory then their opponents health bar begins to decrease. A team wins by reducing the enemy teams health to zero. There are two main variations of this mode. One has multiple points (usually three) on the map to capture, and the other only has one point on the map. Regardless which game type is on, almost all matches are won by the team who controls the center of the map.The vehicle physics are great. Tanks move like tanks. Unlike in World of Tanks where the tanks move as if they are slow heavy cars, tanks in War Thunder behave like tracked vehicles. This mean that they slide around, struggling to get traction, especially if you are traveling at speed. This can be used as a good tactic when attacking an enemy tank, skidding around them to get a clear shot of the less protected back of the tank. You can also embarrassingly flip your tank upside down if you’re not driving carefully. Graphic wise the games mostly looks great but there are a few areas that look dated. The tanks and other vehicles look amazing. The developers have put a lot of detail into the tank models, from the detailed textures, weld marks on joints, and just little imperfections on the tanks. These give the impression that the tanks were hand-built in a factory like their real counterparts, rather than crafted using a 3D modeling tool. However the terrain looks a bit dated and can sometimes look very angular. Some of the ground textures also look blurry and stretched.The game’s audio is top-notch. It sounds like a living battlefield. Headphones are a must as you’ll hear every creek and sputter your tank makes, and more importantly the sounds your enemies will make. The best sounds are the ones made when firing your tanks cannon. No other game has weapons that are as satisfying to fire than these!As with War Thunders air combat a lot of people will compare this to World of Tanks. Comparing the two though is a bit like comparing Counter-Strike with Battlefield 2. Both share the same weapons/vehicles and on some maps have similar objectives, but they are different enough that playing both will give two different experiences. World of Tanks is more like a team death match, while War Thunder plays like large game of King of the Hill. The most obvious difference is that in World of Tanks you only get one tank per match, while in War Thunder as long as you have spare tanks and crews you can keep respawning. This makes a big difference as people are more cautious playing World of Tanks while players are more willing to take risks to grab objectives in War Thunder. Overall War Thunder tank battles are great.The combat is exciting and rewarding.One shotting a higher tier tank is a great feeling. War Thunder is free to play, and while you can play this game without ever needing to spend a single penny, if you get into it then there are plenty of tanks to buy.  Don’t worry if you don’t plan on paying for anything though, as the game is balanced enough to stop people from paying to win. If you’re a fan of World of Tanks or enjoy tank combat check this out. War Thunder plays different enough for you to happily play both.","March 24, 2015","true","106.4"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","19","34","0","0"

However, the recent changes to the economy, including the tier/research revamp, have caused the people I play with and myself to stagnate horribly.  Now, I feel like I am not getting any closer to a high-tier fighter.  That is because I am not.  On average, I have received about 500 points towards a new plane, which costs about 120,000.  That's about half a percentage.  Granted, before the XP system was flawed similarly, but you unlocked every plane for a level once you leveled up, and there were times when I got 10,000-20,000 XP, so now I have to play approximately 4 times as many games to unlock just ONE PLANE.  Not to mention, I then have to pay for it with lions, the game's currency.  So, while the early tiers seem to be pretty much the same, more or less, after about tier 3 the game becomes an unbearable grind.  So, if you feel like grinding for hundreds of hours, feel free, and obviously there are casual options.  However, I would suggest purchasing premium/eagles or waiting until they fix the economy.","September 3, 2013","false","120.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Good graphics and very fun.  Worth a shot for anyone interested!    And its FREE, there is the odd items you can buy. So far it doesnt seem at all Pay 2 Win.  So Free is Free! :D","March 19, 2015","true","110.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Matchmaking just sucks, you'll get uptiered systematicly, meaning u are fighting planes much stronger, thus making the game not fun anymore.\nAlso the killing system is completely messed up, when you shoot a plane completely out of order, but someone lands one shot before the plane goes down, you don't get the kill.\nWhen you are playing longer this means there are 100's of kills stolen from you, which is very annoying.\nThe worst thing is that Gajin doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the players and their opinions, there are countless topics with very good ideas to fix the problems, completely prepared and ready to be inserted in the game, but they just won't do it without giving an explanation.","August 26, 2014","true","182.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
