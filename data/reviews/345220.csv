The game is a turn based type stelath/action. All of which is something I normally hugely enjoy, but something didn't sit quite right for me here.\n\nThe turn based mechanic didn't seem to feel right for me. The enemies seem to walk around in real time, while your character can only move/make actions in turns. I have to say I did enjoy the first level or two but after that it seemed to get  more and more difficult to control and manover around the levels.\n\nI did find a few bugs in game where bad guys could see me through walls, run straight up to me regardless of turns and take half of my health off in two hits before I had even had a turn,  this almost turned into a game breaker for me.\n\nI do enjoy the art style, even though the graphics could be a little more polished. I also enjoyed the writing, very crude humor, one of the better features here.\n\nSadly, in it's current state, I cannot recommend Agent Awesome. Hopefully we'll see a patch/update soon to fix the bugs.","April 13, 2015","false","2.3"," 54 of 72 people (75%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","75","54","72","9","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/recommended/345220/","MartyrA2J","MartyrA2J","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/","557 products in account","When playing games like Agent Awesome one has to approach with a sense of whimsy and care free nature. Why? Well, the developer did make a game but it's game that doesn't take itself too seriously, and that feels true even in some features of the game itself. The game aims to be funny and again not be too serious. There are a lot of pop culture references, cheesy dialogue, and wacky enemies. If this is your type of thing, you might wanna keep reading. Now before we continue any further, I feel like I should just get this outta the way and say that Agent Awesome is an App ported to PC. Ergo there is no resolution control, and many other features missing that you would expect in a PC title. It's important to note the game doesn't natively support widescreen either. The menus and entire control scheme is completely based off a touch pad screen. This isn't my favorite thing in the world but that is just the way things are.\n\nSo with that out of the way, Agent Awesome is a turn based stealth/action game. The story goes after meeting up with somebody who rhymes with Mick Furry, you are dared to eliminate everybody inside E.V.I.L. a mega corporation of evil who happens to be your former employer. They are conducting evil experiments and have an assortment of insane crap between you and your objective, ranging from flying sharks, killer koalas and plain old guards.\n\nThe art style of Agent Awesome, just like the humor of the game isn't too serious. Characters have huge heads and  everything has a cartoonish vibe to it. This, I liked about Agent Awesome. At the beginning, there is also a humorous cut scene about your drunken debauchery. The levels, on the other hand, left something to be desired. Aside from occasional props, most of the levels had obviously been slapped together kinda like a Minecraft design, square by square. One thing to be noted is how pathing works in this game. All the paths are kinda laid out for you and you can't really stray from the path.\n\nThe way combat/stealth works is that you click/tap the back arrow which brings you into the tactical planning screen. From this screen you can map out which path you will take by clicking on points and connecting them together. To kill guards you tap/click on weapons and then on the victim. Once combat engages, both parties take turns whacking at each other with their perspective weapons. Depending on your loadout, health, and enemy strength your usually going to win. There are ways to screw it up, but it really is a bit of a no-brainer for the most part. My issue lies with the tactical screen. To do anything at all you must return to this screen, so you end up looking at a map more than anything else. For a game, this is very jarring and disjointed. Yes, you see the character perform your actions but it becomes silly when you want him to do something simple like just move to the next node. You have to pause the game, plan out a route and then go back into the game.\n\nNow, Agent Awesome does have quite a bit of weapons to mess around with. The one I found the most useful was the Garrote. With this item you could sneak up behind guards and kill them instantly, with no struggle. One part that was funny and, I think was a glitch, is that I would instantly teleport on their back or side depending on how close I was. This also made the game incredibly easy. The level designs I will say were pretty solid for the most part. You could stealth your way thru or slaughter indiscriminately.\n\nOne thing blissfully missing from the PC version are micro-transactions. Instead you have cash/points you earn after every level that you can use to upgrade the agent's armory. These points do rack up a bit slowly, more than likely leading to a bit of grinding to get all the best gear. The music was fine, the sound effects were standard. Nothing exceptional, but it didn't become hard on the ears. I did enjoy was the voice acting despite this. Agent Awesome obviously is a fan of Archer Sterling, they seem to take queues from the show as far as dialogue.\n\nThe game has about 12 levels for you to sink your teeth into. The levels can get rather large and there are options to turn off the dialogue for repeated playthroughs. You can probably squeeze three to four hours out of the game. Agent Awesome also features in-game achievements. There is also an encyclopedia that I found humorous.\n\nI will say that I haven't really seen many games like Agent Awesome, whether that is a good or bad thing is still up to debate. It works great for the mobile market but feels a little lacking on PC. Keep in mind though, that this is a game purely for stupid fun sake. This isn't Skyrim or anything. It's called Agent Awesome. What do you expect? So if you're looking for something different, weird, and maybe even a little stupid fun at times, check out Agent Awesome. It's $9.99 on Steam but you can probably get it cheaper on the mobile market.","August 31, 2015","true","1.3"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","23","26","2","0"

We can only hope that the developer get some money to fix some bugs, like readding the health increase (what some players see as disadvantage, even if they protection suit and health pack helps you or the thug mask). The game is not hard like some players says all 12 levels are easy-middle. You just need to use your brain. Its funny to try get the highest highscore i have after 100 Min. a score of over 20 Millions http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=490224104 with out cheating and its still feel i dont make the best perfect way to it. The game has many potential to find out. The Intro and Story is short but quality fine (like the Leonardo di Caprio/ Martin Sheen Jokes). I feel the 8 years work are compressed in this game, even if you have only 5 min real fun that its worth of this game and my brother has over 25 and i had 100 minute even if i saw the most of my brothers playing. Sure its better you be a strategy fan or a real gamer that want see all and get the best scores and hardest challenges (pistol only, Ghandi Ghost Bonus, Master Strategy+ Genocide+ Ghost Bonus Combos) but even for the others there are 3-5 hours fun for good gamers and for middle gamers till 10 and 15. Even if it feel clunky. You have some options to do so you can make 2-3 walktroughs and enjoy. The most negative reviews have not even 1 hour play time or then under 3-5 hours and write about the not good enough graphic of a indie game. Its the unique gameplay that make this game to unique game experience. You can change all time where you go, some weapons dont kill some enemys, so you need to get the right weapon with you and look for your ammo or avoid it somehow or pass it in small timing phases. Give the game a chance and enough time to find out all the little details and just enjoy it even if its only some minutes, it was hopefully worth to be entertained.

Is my favorite of its kind, it is very funny, fun to play, and has quite a bit of content to it. So for the gameplay and content, I do give it a high rating for several reasons. The first being how much content is in the game there are 12 levels each getting harder and harder as the game goes on so you have to re-strategies through each mission which keeps the game fun and interesting. Along with each level you get new enemies from police to dogs or dolphins to scientist which is unique and pretty funny. Then you have the weapons, there are 9 weapons then exras like med kit and body armor. Most of these can be upgraded several times to take on each new enemy. Then along with each level you can choose how you want to go about playing it, like  a ghost which is to complete the level killing none or very few enemies, which seems to be harder for me. So what I do is the opposite which is Genocide, killing every enemy in the level, it is also challenging, but very fun to do and the best way to try out the new weapons. So as you can tell there is a great amount of content, uniqueness, and gameplay. It'll keep you busy and having a great time during it.\nThen for the achievement hunters out there, this game isn't too bad for them. Some grindy, time consuming achievements, but nothing too crazy.\nFinally I give this game a thumbs up and a buy. If you haven't picked this game up yet I would say do yourself a favor and pick it up, you will have fun and enjoy this game.","February 17, 2015","true","7.7"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","13","27","0","1"

To get in all 12 levels the best way (master strategy/ tough guy, ghandi ghost, favorismn and other bonus ) needs the best thing of using the right items smart. You need strategy, timing and testing to get the best way to get the highest and lowest score. Its sure not a masterpiece and has only 12 levels but the challenges to find the best way to be a top god agent makes fun. I play now many hours to get the best. The sound and graphic are not the best, it has its one atmosphere feeling.

It could be a good idea but it remains a title with irony sometimes brilliant but not enough to compensate for all other shortcomings.\n\nSpendere una cifra del genere per un gioco che non offre altro che qualche sorriso e pochi minuti di gioco per livello, sembra eccessivo rispetto ad altri titoli strategici o tower defense classici decisamente più longevi e vari. Agent Awesome poteva essere una buona idea ma rimane un titolo dotato di ironia a volte geniale ma non sufficiente a compensare tutte le altre mancanze.\n\nhttp://www.gamesource.it/agent-awesome/ 4.8/10","February 19, 2015","false","2.8"," 12 of 29 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","12","29","0","0"

Yes, “Agent Awesome” is ‘playable’. Yes, it ‘involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device’. Yes, it can be described as a videogame by literally any definition of the word, but IT’S NOT A VIDEOGAME.\n\nIt’s like, ♥♥♥♥♥, videogames are for nerds and other than that freakshow Michael Anger I don’t associate with nerds.\n\nBut let me describe “Agent Awesome”, which I like to refer to as an experience of the life-affirming variety.\n\nPROS\n- You can play this ♥♥♥♥, like, a million times. Until the cows’ homecoming or the inevitable sequel. I have my way (all the time), but you can play it in yours. Stealth. Rambo. Your pick.\n- Throughout those million times, you’ll get to stare at my pretty face (and/or ♥♥♥, if you play with the camera)\n- Achievements! Get all 50 to enlarge your (internet) lady pleaser.\n- Mrs Awesome, PhD said it was “Pretty okay.”\n- So did your mother. Last night. Boom.\n\nCONS\n\n- Poor representation of my torso in polygon form (you can barely see my pectorals, chest hair, third nipple, and vestigial tail).\n- Throughout the whole ordeal, I was chewing on mint herbs. You can’t smell my breath through the interface (but you might in a future update).\n- You can only buy it once.\n- No wait, I’ve just been told you can buy it a bunch of times. You should.\n\nOVERALL\n\nYes.\n","February 17, 2015","true","0.2"," 21 of 72 people (29%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","29","21","72","45","9"
