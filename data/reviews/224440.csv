READ ON!\n\nThis game has had quite the history on Steam. Before you buy into all of the negative or positive reviews on this particular game, allow me the opportunity to provide some enlightenment.\n\nIt is true this game has been an Early Access game for a couple of years now. It is true that it is still incomplete.\n\nIt is also true that this game has been consistently improved upon week after week, month after month. It is also true that the developers consistently respond to the Community feedback, and incorporate many ideas with the direction and focus of the game.\n\nOne thing a lot of people do not realize is that this game was one of the FIRST Early Access Games through Steam, and at that time, both the developers and the Steam Community didn't really have a set standard of production of how far a long a game had to be, before it was released into the Community. Folk Tale has paid the price with mixed reviews because the initial launch of the game was virtually unplayable.\n\nTHIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE.\n\nThis game has two builds, experimental, and public.\n\nThe Experimental build is the most active, up to date version of this game as it stands now. It is updated almost weekly like clockwork. More content and fixes are added in every single patch.\n\nThe Public build is a more stabilized version of the game for those who do not mind having a slightly slower updating schedule for a more stable platform. This build is the culmination of all of the successful experimental build patches, usually about 6-8 patches, that get rolled in all at once.\n\nBoth builds are extremely playable. Almost all of the negative reviews for this game have focused on issues that have been long ago resolved, or people that are sour about buying into an Early Access game, even with the full knowledge beforehand that it was incomplete, hence Early Access.\n\nA fair assessment of this game would be that it has about 50% of its total content at the time of this writing. That DOES NOT MEAN it is only 50% playable.\n\nThe content that is available is well balanced, well executed, and with a mountain of community support behind it.\n\nIn my 25 years of gaming, I have never seen a more proactive, responsive development team that regularly updates and informs the community about the goings on of the current state of Folk Tale.\n\nShould you buy this game? I would. Even with only half of its content available, this game kicks the ever living crap out of almost every other game in this same genre. I would not be surprised, if once all the content has been implemented, this game would be priced in the $60 range.\n\nDon't let negative, EARLY ACCESS, reviews color your vision about this game. This will be a must have, and in my opinion, already is if for no other reason than the Community and Developers that stand behind it.\n\nTry it for yourself, and find the magic of Folk Tale. Give this game a fair chance, and I promise you personally, you will not be disappointed.","December 13, 2015","true","92.0"," 1,327 of 1,380 people (96%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","96","327","1","28","30"

First impressions were very positive with good contrasts, interesting visuals for the animations and I've always generally liked this genre.\n\nWell after two years I decided to give it another go and quite honestly there have been very little improvements I truly wish there was but there hasn't been. The interface is still just as awkward, the villagers are about as smart as a brick, the camera is slow, the amount of control you have feels very little and lack luster and overall it's just a big let-down on what I had imagined it would of become by now.\n\nNow before someone throws the "It's an Early Access Game" I will say that I know this, I got it on it's initial release to Early Access and I had high hopes for it but within the two years, there hasn't been much in the way of progress. I'm quite tired of seeing games with this big blue sticker being slapped on them "Early Access Game" as if to be a kind of selling point like "We'll get better soon, promise!" but for it to never actually happen.\n\nIn it's current state the game is not worth it and if I knew how slow or none existant the effort to improve and develop this game would be, I wouldn't of bought it at all because it's just a wasted space in my steam library and money from my pocket that could of been spent on things much better.\n\nDon't listen to the "Positive Reviews" all being spammed because they've all been encouraged to do it and it's really dishonest and terrible marketing on the developers part so please spend your money else where if you actually want a game.\n\n:: Edit ::\n\nI decided to indulge the comments about me apparently saying things that are untrue and sat down for a full two hour session to see the differences. Things they've added short list:\n\nUpgradable buildings but they don't work even when you have necassary resources\nMore buildings that some are simply filler and the rest are extra for "needs"\nMore worker roles that are all equally slow at their given tasks\nDiseases are a thing and the villagers are too stupid to use medicine you have stocked\n\nI understand they reworked the game but the bare bones of the game from the original early access is still all there. Things the same short list:\n\nYour NPC's are still as dense as a brick\nNo adjustable camera speed just slow and mildly faster by holding shift\nYour militia are still generally very ineffective\nResources are painfully slow to gather\nAmount of control still feels short in contrast to what it should be\nGameplay feels unengaging and lack luster just waiting on resources\nDay - Night cycle still doesn't seem to change anything\n\nSummary: It feels like a game that had high hopes in a lot of ways yet lives up to very little of them so I still don't recommend it.\n\nP.S Everyones entitled to their opinion, don't try force feed your own to others.","April 24, 2015","false","6.8"," 1,837 of 2,048 people (90%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","90","837","2","41","58"

I thought it looked like a cool concept, and I had no idea that the trailer was actually the entire scope of the game back then. In the time that this game's been in Early Access, I:\n\n* Finished a Master's Degree\n* Moved to a new city\n* Moved to another new city\n* Held three different jobs\n* Witnessed the birth of four children among my friends' families\n* Developed a hernia\n* Had enough time for the hernia to heal without surgery\n* Bought a new computer\n* Beat The Witcher 3\n* Beat The Witcher 3 AGAIN\n* Read 14 different books (CORRECTION: 15)\n* Watched approximately 1000 sunsets\n* Deleted 20 duplicates of some crazy French stalker's comments on this review. Mon Dieu!\n\nPro Tip: Wait for them to finish it, then maybe take another look.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nTo be clear, before anyone throws the other obvious argument at me... Yes, I have played the game since those early weeks and, yes, it has advanced since then. But progress has been limited, and at this pace Folk Tale is more likely to die a slow death than ever realize the charming vision it had when it first came to Steam.\n\nI've already paid for it, so I'll certainly give it another look from time to time to see if anything ever becomes of it, but the whole premise of this review is that this game's a terrible risk compared to most other Early Access titles. What exists right now is still a bit of a mess, and not worth the price, and there's a very good chance that that's all you'll ever get for your money. Anyone who doesn't already have money riding on it should definitely wait.\n\nI'm not wishing doom on Games Foundry, and I'll eat my own words if they ever manage to turn this ship around, but... don't put money on that, either.\n\nEdit #2:\n\nIn my continued drive to live at 3.82x the speed of Early Access development, I just finished another book..... "A Great and Terrible King: Edward I and the Forging of Britain" by Marc Morris. Lots of fascinating historical anecdotes, and Morris is also an incredible narrator.\n\nEdit #3:\n\nThree of Folk Tale's most loyal minions went through and downvoted... every single review I've ever written, even ones that no one had ever voted on before. I would like to thank these brave heroes for taking the time to read me previously-unnoticed reviews.","May 5","false","7.7"," 651 of 770 people (85%) found this review helpful 222 people found this review funny","85","651","770","222","3"

"Alpha 26".  - End of edit\n\nSince I'm tired of editing this review everytime Simon Dean tweaks a spider spawn or adds a couple boards to a cottage, bored with the game and unconcerned about how accurately it describes it's current progress... or lack thereof... I deleted everything previously written here and decided to ramble on about mostly nothing. I figure if it's okay for the positive reviewers to do, it oughta be okay for the negative reviewers also.\n\nSuffice it to say that whatever condition the game is in when you read this it's development track has been been slow as molasses in January and plagued with poor design choices, many to the point of being laughable if not shameful. It doesn't appear that the development team has an iota's worth of talent, relying almost solely on community feedback to not only determine the type of game it will be but also how to simply implement features in a sensible, intelligent way.\n\nThe game's (currently) "Mixed" review score is well-deserved in comparison to many other early access games with a similar amount of time in early access. For both the rabid fans and the developer this amount of time is the go-to excuse for why it has such a poor score but this is certainly not the case when we look at the glowing review scores of many other games with two or more years of early access development. Some examples include Prison Archirect, Kerbal Space Program (released) and Invisible Inc. (released). Sure, some negative reviews are based on this and others do take it into account but it is not the sticking point for the majority of Folk Tale's negative reviews. Rather, the problem is and has always been what the game has to show for those two years, most of which has been broken features, utterly horrid design choices, some of the worst AI on record and the complete absence of key game components like load/saves and management abilities. And for your information, two years of early access development is half or less of Folk Tales total development time. THisis a quite a significant factor when you understand how woefully lacking this game is/was just a few short months ago. To have even called it an alpha would have been generous.\n\nIt's also worth noting that a large number of positive "reviews" for this game are simply shill reviews, written at the behest of the developer who begged, in a long since unpinned forum thread, that they be written to increase Folk Tale's review score. Read them. What you will find is that they say little or nothing about the actual game. They just ramble on about how active the developer is in the forum and the game's potential. Why is this the case? Simple. There was just nothing good to say about the game itself.\n\nHow is the game now? I don't know and frankly, I don't care. I still don't recommend that you buy it though. Why? Because the developers clearly have no idea what they're doing. The game looks great. It pretends to be even greater. Unfortunately, the actual game has never done much but spun it's wheels. Buy it when it's finished, assuming you aren't old and grey by then. It may, at that point, bear some resemblance to what it's described to be... and perhaps it will actually work, the AI won't be dumb as a bag of hammers, every building will work as intended and managing your citizens won't be tantamount to trying to herd a flock a kittens thru a bird sanctuary.","February 18, 2015","false","14.5"," 509 of 597 people (85%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","85","509","597","37","44"

The progress is extremely slow and I think at the very least their price point needs to lower. They had to have known just how slow their progress would be and if not they should be more transparent about the issues.\n\nIf they continue at this rate of progress what will it take? Two or another three years at the most? At that point how outdated will the final product look? I suppose it could be magnificent, but I doubt it. Highly.\n\nThis game has plenty of potential, for sure, but you can say that about many games in early access. They would be more deserving of your investment than Folk Tale. This game should not have been released into early access with nothing but bare bones, I remember that it was. I didn't mind supporting the development, but time and time again, I come back and barely see anything different from the last time I checked in.\n\nI don't think anyone will get their money's worth from this title at this point and fear a Spacebase kind of situation happening here.

So after reading a lot of the outdated reviews I decided this game needed one.\n\nFirst for you impatient people, do not buy an early release game. Some devs prefer quality over quantity and these devs are just that. Yes the process is slower then most of the games I have snagged in early release but it's been worth it.\n\nSo far the demo in game shows a ton of promise and I can't wait for the RPG elements to get added into this game. But as of right now they've done a really good job with adding sandbox, character editor, and a map editor. I've monkeyed around with all the features and have enjoyed it.\n\nPersonally I could say yes buy the game now but we all have different preferences and patience levels. So where the game sits at the moment if you enjoy editing and messing around with sandbox games it's worth more of a look into for you. If your steam library is lacking sandbox like games this probably isn't the game for you.\n\nI will update this every once the game comes out of early access.\n\nYou can get more info at the devs blog here http://blog.gamesfoundry.com/","May 29, 2014","true","7.1"," 221 of 289 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","221","289","0","4"

My opinion is that it has a solid foundation now and has already begun implementing many of the big items that many of us have been waiting for. I have read a lot of negative reviews like anybody else looking at a mixed review game and there are many older reviews that really did make sense at the time they were posted, but this is now and that was then.\n\nThe game?\n\nIn short...\nYour the hero looking for treasure chests, killing enemies, and progressing through a story. Your also the one controlling the growth of the town, building walls, and making troops to travel with the hero and guard the town. However, the game is made so you can set up your town and use a summary to see whats needed or if anything is. That leaves you free to focus on your hero at times without your town falling apart. Make sure you have guards though.\n\nFew more details...\nThe game looks just like the videos, smooth and tranquil. Your townspeople walk everywhere to do their job. (transport goods, plant trees, hunt animals, eat, etc.) So you will not see somebody working a farm non-stop and you gather food over time. It is easy to get caught up watching your people and forget that you need to clear our enemies from a nest or go look for treasure chests. Do not be fooled though. Enemies are hard and your hero is not an unstoppable force. Nests and such also grow over time if not destroyed. That means larger numbers and can quickly wipe out everything you have worked for. You should also make or find better equipment for your hero, guards, and citizens. Don't want to micro manage? Make the gear, move it to your inventory, put it into the citizens place of employment, and they will equip it if they can. There is a lot more than just your city building and townspeople. (i.e. story line, settements, other heros, etc.) I will let the videos, images, and devs cover the rest.\n\nThe devs?\n\nIn short...\nWatch a recorded live feed to get a feel for them. They will look at and test things simply because a player mentions it. So yes, they work very close to the players. You can see the peer to peer communication in the live feeds all the time. Updates are pushed out as quickly as possible and content is always being adjusted to find the best settings, look, and/or feel.\n\nIn detail...\nDo you think the game is how it is now because the devs said it will be this way? If so, you are wrong. Countless things have been adjusted because of player comments and many times they are tested on the spot during a live stream. The devs are normally guys. They do talk to people but they do not talk down to people. Some of the reason things move slower than you may like is because the devs are working so close with the players to revise anything from NPC spawn rates to graphics, but don't be shocked if they say no.","December 17, 2015","true","20.9"," 96 of 110 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","96","110","6","0"

May 2013, and since the release very little has changed aside from bugfixes and the addition of a savegame feature. In my opinion the game was released on Steam too early.\nIt has a very nice art style and the concept for it looks great - but the available playable content is very, very limited.\n\nThe plan is for this to be a sandbox experience type of game with stuff like building your own town, crafting, sieges, characters that gain experience and equip items that monsters on the map/in dungeons drop, and much more. Together with the overall graphical/sound quality of the game and the chosen theme, this would make for a great experience.\n\nBut only a tutorial for one of the races is available for now, and even though the developers are commited to communication and bugfixes, the available content does not warrant the purchase of the game at the time of writing this - 28 November 2013.

I played it for a couple hours and thought to myself: "Well I supported the project, I guess I'll just wait and let the developers work." I have not been disappointed with the progress that has been made coming back to it a couple years later.\n\nBuilding is rather enjoyable and watching your town grow into a bustling city is a rewarding experience. As your city grows you're constantly devising ways to improve people's 'happiness' by offering more rations or creating new jobs to keep the populace content and working away. All of the jobs work and the villagers carry out their tasks with little prodding from the player, allowing you to focus on city planning and defending. The jobs themselves are varied and all play a role in how well your city will run. There are also research trees for each profession to improve productivity or expand the area in which they will work.\n\nThere is a fair amount of building options to make for some interesting town ideas. Buildings are also upgradeable to improve their capacity as well, allowing the player to go for a more minimalist approach if they so desire. Many of the structures work in tandem with others (A hunting lodge will have villagers collect meat, but in order to feed that meat to your citizens you must also build a butcher, etc). I like the idea of this because it makes the player have to do a small bit of planning in order to maximize efficiency of these professions. The buildings are all unique as well and visually different so smart building placement allows for some beautiful looking towns and cities. You can also place buildings nearly everywhere and rotate them as you see fit, allowing lots of freedom in where you want your town to be located as well as how you want it to look.\n\nAs for the game itself: The UI is simple and easy to get into. There are tooltips for beginners that explains what each building does, and what other buildings compliment them so that they work properly. You can also assign jobs to individuals without having to click each villager and send them off to the proper buildings, and it's easy to switch a villager from one profession to the next. There is also some layer of complexity with the research and upgrading systems, to allow players some freedom in which areas of production they wish to improve. Everything works great and I have experienced very few bugs outside of a single crash on the tutorial, which worked later when I tried again. The game runs great and is very stable for an alpha build, and it's optimized well and has no frame rate issues.\n\nThe heroes portion of the game breaks the mould a bit as you can use them to go adventuring. You can also train some soldiers to aid your heroes along in whichever endeavours you want them to have, adding a sort of real time strategy feel to the game. The heroes also have unique abilities and can even be fully equipped from head to toe with various armors and weapons (As can every villager or soldier in the game), allowing the player to make them as strong or weak as you want.\n\nAll in all Folk Tale is a lot of fun, and I can't wait to see what's in store for the future of the game.","November 29, 2015","true","6.4"," 87 of 99 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","87","99","5","0"

With a title labeled as “mixed” the first place I usually jump over to is the negative reviews and see what people are saying.  This game, with its “mixed” rating, was no different.  I saw claims that the development team wasn’t active, they were bullying people on the forums, and the game had almost no content to it.  Something to be avoided, right?  But I noticed something else.  On many of the negative reviews the developers had replied and tried to help resolve the reviewer’s problems.  That doesn’t seem like bullying to me, and certainly doesn’t seem like they aren’t active.  So I went and checked the positive reviews.  The top one was written by a fellow named “Eddie=VX9=” and pretty much his first statement was that you shouldn’t judge this game based on the negative reviews.  I continued to read his review and was fairly impressed by its content.  This led me to risk purchasing the game.  Do I regret that decision?  Obviously not.\n\nReview\nWhen I first jumped into Folk Tale I have to admit, it wasn’t a positive experience.  But it was my fault.  I’m a regular player of RTS games and figured this was just like any other so I selected to start a new campaign.  Big mistake.  The story began and I immediately realized I hadn’t a clue how to play.  Sure, I was able to grab some units and defend the village.  I was able to get a few people foraging for berries and wood.  But I didn’t understand how the buildings worked.  I had tons of meat but my villagers were leaving the village because, I later found, there was nobody turning that meat into something actually edible.  I didn’t have a butcher!  So my first shot at the campaign ended in under 20 minutes with my villagers abandoning me.  Yay team!\n\nI then went back to the main menu, clicked new game, and sheepishly clicked Tutorial.  Within another 20 minutes I had learned everything I needed to learn to give the campaign another go.  It turned out to be a fairly easy task to assign (or remove) villagers to buildings, although a little different than other RTS games.  Once I had the basics figured out, the campaign called me once more.  This time I had everything under control and really started to enjoy the game.  I found that this wasn't only an RTS experience, it has a bit of RPG dungeon crawling to it as well.  Quite a nice experience overall.\n\nAdmittedly I haven’t tried the sandbox mode yet.  I assume it's basic village building with random attacks.  I can imagine that would be an enjoyable experience.  There's also the in-game map/misison creator which gives you pretty much endless replayability in this title, and I'm heavily looking forward to messing around with it.  I did notice there wasn't any multiplayer, and I wish there was, but there is so much else available that it really isn't a big loss.\n\nNow, let’s get down to the nitty gritty.\n\nGraphically, I absolutely love this game.  I really don’t know what to compare it to because I haven’t seen any RTS games with this style of graphics.  It’s almost Disney-like, if that’s a word, with overtones from the Settlers series.  You can look at the screenshots and game play videos for yourself.  I would have liked to see better animations on buildings being constructed, like maybe showing them in different phases of construction instead of the completed building simply rising through the ground.  That’s not a major complaint though.\n\nAudio in the game was fairly well done, and I love the music, but I have some reservations when it comes to voiceovers.  Much of the campaign dialogue has voiceovers but you’ll have some instances where it almost seemed like a voiceover was missing.  A quick example would be the start of the campaign where the villain was talking to his henchmen and, while his voiceover was awesome, the henchmen had nothing but a text box.  It almost seemed like the henchmen’s voiceover was missing, which it could be considering this is still an early access game.  A game should either have full voiceovers, or none at all.  I’d like to see that corrected before final release.\n\nGame play itself is rather well thought out in Folk Tale.  A lot of the villager control is handled by an AI, which can surprisingly be turned off (per unit) if you want.  You simply assign the villager to a building (promote) and they go about the job without any further action on your part.  When you remove a villager from that task (demote) they return to a simple villager and do the “grunt work” around the village.  These villagers are your builders and resource carriers, but can also be assigned to other tasks like berry foraging and tree chopping without being assigned to a building (job).  You also have control of the distribution of materials as well as collection of taxes.  These help you fine tune the happiness of your villagers and can also help get you through tough times without your village becoming a ghost town.  The effect is limited, in that if you have no food increasing the amount of food a villager receives obviously won't have any effect.  You also have the RPG aspect, which means not only do your main (hero) units level up and get stat points, but you can also equip all of your units (including villagers).  Equipment is mostly found by either defeating enemies or forraging through the various dungeons (like the bandit cave).\n\nTL:DR & Conclusion\nAll in all I have to agree with the excellent review that “Eddie=VX9=” did.  This game may have had problems in the past but it’s well on its way to becoming a game that any RTS fan would love to have.  The RPG aspects mixed in with the RTS makes it a wonderful experience.  I'll admit this game may not be for everyone, but it's a game I'm glad to have in my collection.\n\n\nNote To The Devs\nYou're doing a great job, the whole team, and I don't want you to get discouraged by some of the negative reviews this game is getting.  Honestly, most of the negative reviews are either way outdated or absolute nonsense.  I can see the road you've laid down and I, as well as others, are very excited to see the work continue.  Keep it up!  This game has a ridiculous amount of potential in both the game itself and the community it can build around it.  It deserves to be finished, even if it's just to prove the nay-sayers wrong.  Once it's done you might even consider raising the price a little, because it'll be worth it.  Keep your chins up and speak proudly about this game when you do.  Here's to the future!  :beermug:","January 1","true","5.7"," 71 of 77 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","71","77","2","20"

Which by the way, went from a story driven game, to now, nothing more then a sandbox story builder. They completely removed the story. They also removed the tutorial.\n\nUpdates are rare, and add almost nothing. Oh, sweet, you want to fix two or three bugs? Awesome, if you updated more consistently and actually provided content instead of you know, taking content away.\n\nInterface sucks. I'm not even kidding.

This game had alot of potential, and originally, had my focus to buy it because of the story driven village mayor type feel it claimed to have. Now, the game is worse then it was when they first released it. They never update the damn thing, and when they do they dont fix sh it.

But while it attempts to marry many games we love, it doesnt play well because each of game mechanics doesnt feel consequential - It just feels like a beautiful empty porcelain vase...\n\n(As a village building sim)\nFor example, the building a village part of it does not really have any cause/effect and consequence. Do you need wood? Just cut from the abundant forrest. Need stone? There's a quarry right there. Need fish? No need to travel, the river is also right beside you. Need more people in your village? You dont have to wait ala Banished and plan ahead... Just plonk a cottage and you will have almost instantaneous  population increase. If a villager dies, a new one will come in less than a minute. Need materials to build new structures? As long as the material numbers are there, you can get anything done instantaneously. No merticulous building like in the original Tropico or Banished, where you can see each citizen chuggin along with materials in hand. What happens in the day and night cycle? Nothing! Its just a cosmetic effect. Does it matter if your buildings are far apart? Not really. There isnt a need to fine tune village efficiency because everyone is way too effcient to get to any meaningful bottleneck. This part of the game feels like a Facebook game, just with better graphics.\n\n(RPG Play)\nSo you have this avatar where you click to whack a enemy. You hit once, and he hits back and it cycles on at perfect interval. There's no weight to the combat and no real strategy to talk about. Whoever has more might and number will win every time. Its 2016 and such banal combat is really for age 5 and under. The regeneration of health point and magic is so fast that you dont need to worry about what is down the road and just bulldoze your way through...\n\n(Village Building + RPG)\nWouldnt it be great if you really build a village up like Banished, worrying about how to get enough food for next winter or your villagers will die, then painstakingly build an armory to equip your hero with the last iron resource so that he can open up a hostile piece of land which in turn allows your villagers to build a mining facility there...? This is simple causality, which unfortunately Folk Tales does not seem to be strong in. Instead, Folk Tales' two core mechanic doesnt really influence each other and is so devoid of a relationship that they are simply two games sharing a common space. Unfortunately neither one feels really well thought out...","April 25","false","4.1"," 111 of 146 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","111","146","2","0"

I tried to play the older AoE series but was left wanting. Even with HD, AoE 2 was still fun but extremely dated. I then tried Banished, fun but grindy and boring once you figured it out, and no military system.\n\nI've been searching steam and saw many possible replacements. Many games that were great looking in their own right, but not exactly what I was looking for; then I found Folk Tale. About 6 months ago I was on this very page and allowed myself to be turned away by the negative reviews. 2 weeks ago I gave it a deeper look. Most recent negative reviews were from people who put in hardly any time to give an objective review.\n\nThat being said, this game is EARLY ACCESS. It is not complete (They estimate completion next year) and does have bugs. There are missing economic systems, features, items, campaign elements, etc...\n\n1. The game is extremely playable in its current form. You can play through and enjoy it.\n2. The bugs that I have encountered some of which were annoying, did not prevent the overall game from being enjoyed.\n3. The economic system is unbalanced, but is clearly being improved/updated/added to. It can easily be worked with/around once you understand it.\n4. The graphics and style is gorgeous.\n5. It is clear that the team is very active with the community, responding to posts of all types. Watching the most recent dev blog, they have already found a clever solution to a problematic economic feature (Which was end game limiting) they had added (Which people were complaining about) and were testing it.\n6. Games Foundry releases almost monthly updates with substantial fixes and improvements. If you do the research, you will see that they have a very detailed and full roadmap.\n7. The community driven approach is refreshing, allowing you to affect the final product, People complain about the initial large scale changes to the game (As community requested). But it's clear that now that they have implemented the changes, they are moving forwards and still adding in the features they had originally intended.\n\nIf you enjoy these types of games and give this one a solid chance, I think you will find that there is a very high ceiling/a ton of potential for this game. I wish they could distribute the tutorial level for free as I think it would allow many people who are on the fence to try for themselves and not rely solely on anonymous reviews.","May 21, 2015","true","39.4"," 101 of 131 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","101","131","3","0"

As someone who isn't at all interested in 'sandbox' style game play, hearing that it has changed its course from the original intention of campaign play and humorous cutscenes makes me feel that I was promised something, but then it was taken away from me after I paid for it.  My money was meant to help aid in the creation of a game that interested me.  When playing through the tutorial, it was that style of gameplay (specifically that it had an engaging story and memorable character development) that set Folk Tale apart from the rest of the generic mess of simulation games in this community.\n\nThere is something to be said for a team that takes their vision a step further by adding fun content and dialogue.  It takes more time, but the rewards are much more satisfying and create an impact with its players.  The same old mediocre Minecraft mentality of 'Here's an open area.  Build something' is as common as the air we breathe.  Developers don't actually have to put any creative effort into it as its expected of the player to create their own source of entertainment from what's given to them.  At first, Games Foundry didn't seem to share this mentality.  This had style, appeal, and put a smile on my face when I played it; leaving me following its progress nearly every step of the way.  Until recently.\n\nNow the initial build has been scrapped and my generosity is funding a 'redesigned concept' based on a communal vote that I did not agree with.  I do understand that the development team takes the consideration of the community very seriously, but it's painful to see the initial concept tossed to the wayside when there are so many other sandboxes out there to play already.  Trying to give it another chance, I redownloaded it to see what new updates had brought us over the course of a year's time.  Seeing the sandbox mode in action only further confirms my reason to be disappointed.  I could feel my heart literally sink to the bottom of my chest at what was on my screen; a hollow, depressing, deconstructed shell of its former self.  It is unlikely I will be installing it again; regardless of full release.\n\nFolk Tale was moving down the path of something refreshing and unique to its genre, but chose to sacrificially overhaul creative integrity and design in lieu of a popularity vote.\n\nIt's sad; incredibly unfortunate because I was looking forward to this game immensely and will no longer be supporting any Early Access titles on steam from this point forward.  The idea of purchasing an apple with expectation I will receive my promised apple, then paying for it and being forced to receive an orange doesn't sit well with me as a consumer.  It builds very distrustful raport.  I do not want another development team to do what Games Foundary has done.\n\nIf a refund were possible, I would respectfully ask for one.  Much to my chagrin, I'm sure my investment was used in the very destruction of what I was looking forward to in the first place-- days and days of wonderfully rendered graphics, stories of adventure, silly voices, and village building.  Now it's nothing more than a graphical editor with bland, blank slate maps.\n\nIt was beautiful and engaging the way it was.\nNow I scroll through it in my Game Library, sigh regretfully, and continue on.\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nTLDR;\nPotential to have been a truly inspiring indie title to pave a new path into this genre, but fell drastically short by letting the controversial steam community decide what the game 'should be' after it was already in development.  Thus, the team overhauled it into a sandbox-focused project instead of campaign with interactive story content.\n\nIf you're into blank slate gameplay with some customization quirks, do support them as the quality of gameplay will be worth its pay for you.  I won't deny that they work hard on Folk Tale; regardless of opinion.  However, if you're supporting it in hopes for something more, be advised to take your money elsewhere.","January 12, 2015","false","5.1"," 457 of 679 people (67%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","67","457","679","23","27"

I was very excited about it, the team seemed to be very motivated and was communicating a lot with its community.\nTried one of the first versions and obviously it was buggy as hell, but it looked like fun. There was also some refreshing humour.\n\nNow two years have passed and we're only in version 0.3... Still, i decided to try it, just to see how much progress they made.\n\nI was quite disappointed. Even the very basic menu got some very basic bugs ! The game itself is slow (at least the tutorial), i've found myself waiting ages befores being able to have enough ressources to progress, all the villagers are slow as hell unless you're asking them to go somewhere specific (why ?).\nPlus there is no easy way to see your global production rates and consumption so you never know if you need more of some ressource until you realize you have none left :(\n\nAlso tried to equip one of my villager with good outfit so he can hunt ennemies and level up, but there is no way to find/favorite/tag villagers so whenever i needed to give the one commands, i had to look for him from his production building (no names on the icons btw... have to click and find each portrait before finding him. And "Find" is a big word as it just unzoom and move camera near the wanted villager ! Why not directly select him ?!).\n\nPlus, i don't have the "fun" feeling i had on early stages. Even though graphics are a bit funny, the game now just looks like a lambda management game and it seems to have lost its identity and originality.\n\nAgain, i've only played the tutorial of 0.3 so i might edit this review later one, but for now, as excited as i was two years ago, i wouldn't recommend this game.\n\nSorry GameFoundry :( I still hope you'll make something amazing and will continue following you.\n\nEdit : Well...

It has all the standard Strategy, City Builder, Civ and management type elements in the game with the added RPG factor where your villagers can level up and wear found loot items etc. The RPG side of the game is currently being developed alongside the more conventional elements of the genre and I am quite excited at the prospect of the final product.\n\nIt has a well developed economy and mechanics system that is still being developed and enhanced. The visuals are very pleasing and conducive to an immersive and relaxing gaming experience. Especially useful when you've had enough of shooting zombies in the face. There is a real cuteness about the game and the characters, the animations and the art style are all very well done.\n\nThe game is still early access so it's still a little limited in terms of how many hours you will get out of it in it's current state. This will change quite soon judging by the developers roadmap. Once upgradable buildings etc are implemented (which is soon) the play time will be increased further. That said once you've played whats already there you will like me, no doubt be very excited about what is coming. There is a development roadmap and the planned features will make this a well rounded and very polished game. Probably the best in the genre(s).\n\nOn to the developers themselves. They are very active devs with regular roadmap live streams showing what is being worked on at any given time. They are very active in the community section inside steam and listen to and act on feedback received from it's early access players. They have stated that they have the required funding to finish the game and have a 9 man team in place to do so. This is not some fly by night early access project. These guys are passionate about their game and that shows itself in the game.\n\nIf you like this style or genre(s) of game then I would recommed keeping a very close eye on this one. It's a game I expect to be playing for a long time to come and is a real credit to the devs.\n\nI will update this review as the game evolves and go into greater detail as the game changes. If you are unsure whether or not this is worth a purchase, at least add it to your wishlist to follow the games progress. I believe that any gamer who likes this genre, will see this product for the quality it is and consider it a worthwhile purchase.","January 12, 2015","true","21.1"," 256 of 399 people (64%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","64","256","399","17","5"

I've played and loved thousands of RPGs in my life too, (from Pool of Radiance and Neverwinter Nights, to Icewind Dale and Skyrim, right through to Divinity: Original Sin and Pillars of Eternity), but I always desired some home base and village building elements.\n\nWell peeps - we're almost there! Our dream is being realised.\n\nThis is a MASSIVE undertaking that Games Foundry has embarked on, and they should be proud of their work. I'm enjoying this game immensely, and recommend it to anyone who is willing to support a small team of devs making a big game with even bigger expectations on it.\n\nIf you don't understand the concept of Early Access and expect a well polished, perfectly balanced, and full game at this point, put it on your wishlist. However, I for one believe in the concept, I believe in the direction, and I believe in the potential, and happily supported the Devs with my hard earned cash to continue the process. Under the above proviso, I hope you do the same.\n\nNow onto specifics:\n\nFUN FACTOR: Heaps of fun with a cute sense of humour! The village building maps are enjoyable; there's a real sense of accomplishment in building up your village to a city size. There are monsters spread throughout the map to vanquish and loot, and who occasionally attack you to keep things interesting. And there's a wide range of buildings, upgrades and items to analyse and discover their interconnectedness. The dungeon crawling map is a fun addition; running around with your hero slicing and dicing mobs while collecting treasure. Overall, there is currently limited content (4 to 5 maps), but there is a in-built level editor for you creative types, and it's great fun for shorter gaming periods.\n\nGRAPHICS: Really good! Nice looking and easy on the eyes, fantastic art style and cute detailing in buildings, protagonists and mobs.\n\nSOUND: So good!!! The music and ambient sounds are pleasant and never off-putting, but the voice acting! It's top notch so far; the advisor is both posh and somewhat imperious, but his voice is lovely, the hero is extremely heroic and (Old washed-up) knight-like, but hilarious. His battle cries make me grin constantly.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Ok. The interface is a bit clunky, and there's some important missing stuff there (such as a villagers list, but that's in the works according to the Devs), for example it's difficult to both find individuals, and to equip them. But the basics are there, and improvements are being added regularly. However, the camera controls are (currently) quite bad. The camera movement is slow, and the changing of camera angles just annoying. Still, these are forgivable whilst in EA.\n\nREPLAYABILITY: Yes and no! This goes back to the first point, there is limited content, but updates are monthly. So I will come back once a month and play the same maps for a few hours again and again to check out the new stuff. I will do this until it's released. Once it's released as a full game I believe I will come back to it regularly, because there are campaigns planned, there are factions included, plus there will be custom content using the level editor.\n\nIn closing, I would first briefly like to touch on the most commonly maintained negatives in the abundance of unhappy reviews, in order to explain them more clearly, and to debunk those that don't really apply anymore. I don't do this for any reason other than the fact that I really love this game, and I don't personally feel that the current rating is reflective of Folk Tale's current state, nor its future potential. (Please keep in mind that the views and opinions expressed herein are those of the author only, and do not necessarily reflect the official position of any other individual or agency)\n\n"There's no story mode / save function / tutorial..." Not true, as all have now been implemented.\n\n"There's no updates..." Blatantly untrue! Updates have been one a month since June 2014.\n\n“It's unplayable...” Ridiculous! I have no problems playing it, and there's plenty of 'Let's Plays” online\n\n“No Dev involvement...” Preposterous!!! The Devs are invested, approachable, and transparent, consistently replying to players reviews or requests.\n\n“Game changed direction after I bought it...” This is partially true, but it changed focus (after a public survey), NOT direction. The citybuilding aspects were focussed on at the outset to get the economy and village system basics working. Now the Devs are focussing again on the RPG portions.\n\n“The Devs asked for supporters to give positive reviews to improve the rating...” SO WHAT?! If you entered your baby into a baby pageant, would you not ask your friends to give positive comments, votes and support? As I said before, the Devs are INVESTED DEEPLY in their cross-genre experience. Wishing for positive reviews and asking reviewers to reassess after so much has changed is hardly doing any harm. Wouldn't you do the same for something you believed in?\n\nTL;DR: In conclusion, I really like this game, it has amazing potential, and I love the direction it is headed in even more. It has good graphics, great sound, and is a fun and rewarding experience. If you want to see a seamless blend of citybuilding strategy and customisable character based RPG, then this is going to be it. But be warned; if you don't understand what early access is, if you don't realise it's sometimes a gamble, if you expect a fully completed, polished and perfectly balanced game right now, then hold off – it's a work in progress and currently somewhat limited in scope.\n\nBut  for me, it's starting to look like the citybuilding RPG cross-genre game I've always dreamed of.","June 12, 2015","true","15.1"," 59 of 78 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","59","78","4","9"

I agree with some reviewers that it is much too early in development for how long the game has been available, however, that is not a reason to rate the game such a low score.

At least half of all scores I've seen was some variation of, "This game still isn't finished, 1/5".\n\nI went ahead and bought this due to some good reviews from people who actually played the game, and I agree that it is a fun makeup. I like the idea of a sandbox-type game like Banished with an RPG element to change things up. Currently as of 8/7/15 there is only a few RPG elements implemented (such as the hero), but more are supposed to be implemented very soon.\n\nThe game has a clear road map to finish, and it looks very attainable. The graphics and sound are good so far, and the gameplay on harder settings have a sense of urgency to get things running ASAP before you get attacked by spiders/goblins/other beasties. I look forward to when this game is actually finished, as it should be as good as I originally thought a few years ago. This game is going in a good direction, IMO.","August 7, 2015","true","9.8"," 50 of 64 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","50","64","0","0"

I've had my eye on the game for some time, and finally took the plunge, and WOW was I suprised - for two reasons.\n\nThe game is even BETTER than I had imagined.  It is such a great blend of RPG and City Builder.... but goodness is there a lack of content and so many features missing.  Seemingly simple things like research options that are in the game, but not functioning.\n\nFor example, you can uprade your fishing huts to provide +1 fish per catch with 2 of the first tier of research options.  But then at the second tier, the +1 fish research option is there, but says (not implemented).  Why? How? lol, if the first tier is implemented, it's not like it's a new mechanic to have the code in there for +1 to each catch.  There are a ton of features like this that are not there "just because."\n\nNone of the magical items tell you what they do, so that whole really cool feature is actually not there, which seems so easy to implement.  Those are just a couple examples of features that are there, but not functioning (and actually say right in the game "not functioning" or "not implemented" or "broken").\n\nIn all honesty, this is one of the most promising games I've ever played. but for such a suprisingly great game, what happened here guys?  I put no to recommending this game, not because it's not a good game, it's amazing, but it's worthless to buy, because for $30, you can get maybe 10 hours out of it before you're completely bored.

This game is like Warcraft and Simcity made a baby, if you like building a city and making sure its safe for your towns people, this is the game for you!\n\nPros :  With this game you have the choice (as it stands now) to either play the Campaign or play in a Sandbox enviroment.  The Campaign allows you to learn the game in nice easy pace. You learn how to control a Hero and some City Watch.  But in the start thats not going to be enough to beat the level.  You will have to create a couple more City Watch.  But thats not it, you have to not only keep your town safe, but make sure your townies have food and are warm.  Because if you only produce a war like village your people will start to starve and leave.  I can't tell you how many times I have made the mistake of rushing to build a barracks and some City Watch but even before I could gather the wood, stones, and Iron my people were Starving and leaving and then there I was with a sorta nice looking town but no one but the birds to keep me company, haha.\n\nOne thing that I love of this game is the different professions that you have access to (22) you first can have a townie start his life in your town as a farmer then change him to be a miner then a monk and then to a City Watch or anything else.  And as your Townie does his job he gains xp which he uses to be a better person.\n\nAs it stands now they have Two different Factions (1) the Gladefolk and (2) the Whithering Dead.  The Gladefolk are like tree people, meaning they are all about peace, love, and mother earth.  The Hero for them is called Willow the Healer, who thus in the name is a healer, she can also revive those around her that had died in one of your awesome battles.  The Whithering Dead on the other hand are there complete opposites!  They are pretty much Necromancers, their Hero is named Lilith the Necromancer, she can raise the dead put some hex's on people and other Necromancer stuff.\nThere is another Hero named Ser Gregory who (as the game guide states) is neutral but in one of the campaigns you get him as your starting Hero He is pretty much the tank of the three main Heros.  There are some other heros that you can find around the grid as well.\n\nThe Loot!  OH MAN THE AMOUNTS OF LOOT, every thing you kill, find, harvest, or dig out of the ground has some sort of use in the game.  For example for you to make mead (Beer) for your townies so they have a better life, you first need to get honey, to get honey you need to build a Bee Yard, to harvest a Bee Yard you need to build a Monastery and then you need to train some Monks.  Sure its a lot of work just to create mead but so worth it.\n\nThere is a world editor, so if you are not feeling the grids that were put together you can create your own landscape!\n\nCons: Now mind you this game is still in early access so some of these cons are because they have not been programmed yet, Buuuut I still feel the need to put in what I have noticed.\n\nThere is a lot of weapons that can only be used by one person/Hero, Also when you go into a cave or something like that there is a lot of loot in the caves that you pick up but does not trasf to the main grid (Now I know that this is a bug or somthing so take it with a grain of salt)\n\nThere is no way to build any type of a pathway or road, like you can build a beautiful town but it will not look more like a quickly built settlement, if they were to allow you to build a road be a dirt to start then a stone road after.  The benifits of having your people walk on a road could allow your townies to walk faster or be more productive or something.\n\nThe bad guys do not respond, now they may put that in later but as of right now if you kill everything in the grid you will have nothing to fear and then it gets kinda boring.  So hopefully they will make the change if not then i guess you can just up the difficulty!\n\nNow that you know my take on the game you should be filled with the wonder that is this game if i were able to rate the game I would give it (in its state of early access) a 4.2 out of 5  Because although it is a great game if they were to say its complete now, would tarnish Games Foundry's Rep as a Gaming company!\n\nBuy this Game!

When you read the negative reviews and some recent comments you would NEVER expect such a high quality experience even at this stage of development.\n\nThe graphics are absolutely gorgeous the entire art design is just superb there is a real "fable" flavour going on and the entire aesthetic just adds to a bizarre feeling of polish even though the game is Alpha. Animations, models, textures, everything just looks and behaves so damn smooth I am struggling to believe some of the recent reviewers actually fired the game up.\n\nI will say that personally I am drawn by the sandbox aspect of the game so take that into account when reading this. I don't really care for story and campaign in an RTS I am much more interested in dozens of random maps, random events and different challenges and paths to the goal each time i play.\n\nWith that said there is a VERY large amount of sandbox content here and all the implemented systems work very very well.\n\nThe description this game gives where it says if you like Warcraft 3, Settlers, Banished, The Guild, Black & White 2 are a bit deceptive. To me it sounded like if you like those games you will like this ... what it didn't say as boldy was "we are combining ALL of these games as one"\n\nThey really have!!! the depth of this game and the realisation of its future potential makes you wonder how Anno 2205 even exists, how Settlers has gone downhill like it has ... tbh it is probably in light of the recent decline from the AAA studios that makes Folk Tale stand out that much more!!!\n\nI love management games, i love tycoon games, i love WC3, Settlers and the Guild but to have all these rolled into one game where each aspect doesn't feel like it was watered down or neglected for the sake of being able to make that statement .... I really am blown away.\n\n\nThis game is proof that a book really should not be judged by it's colour and it is also proof of just how bad things can go when marketing a bit too early. I feel deeply for the devs in that respect because it is clear to me now this is a labour of love and reading any comment on these forums from the devs should bring an immediate sense of encouragement and understanding as to why the game is as it is and how things are handled going forward.\n\n\nI cannot recommend this enough if you like ANY of the games mentioned in the description on the store page. I have no doubts this will be finished and even less doubts that it is going to be a sleeper hit. I imagine it being absolutely huge in Germany if it isn't already.\n\nThese guys truly are a diamond in the rough and all negative reviews really should be ignored at this stage. This is a game where a new page has been turned and due to the way EA works it is suffering from past mistakes but what cannot be overstated is that those mistakes have clearly been learned from and NOTHING but good things are happening going forward.","December 19, 2015","true","2.6"," 40 of 52 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","40","52","3","0"

This was partly down to the fact the the game entered early access at a very early stage of development. (probally too early)\n\nThat being said there has been a lot of hard work put into this game since last May, the art style is still very good along with the music. They have removed the origonal demo as it did not represent the game as it stands now, however I still think you can access it.\n\nThe Sandbox player mode is now a lot more playable and very addictive with 3 maps (levels) to play from, easy, medium and hard with the option to pick a Crypt map as which is WIP. Each map allows you to build up your village with varoius  building types and units.However you cant level these building yet. While you build your village theres the resourse & economy aspect thats comming together now quite nicely. this allows  you to  gather wood,stone, iron different types of food that allow you to run  and build up your town/village.\n\nThere are plenty bad guys to attack, Goblins, spiders Beastmen undead and a few others depending on map you picked  in the first instance using units you build from the Barracks. AI and ther animation are ok for now. one of things I like is the villagers going about there chores. You can also take loot from fallen foes to make your own troops better.\n\nOn top of the player mode there's the Editor where you can build your own maps & characters, In the next patch they are adding another function to this to allow scripted events of sort.. however this is all work in progress.\n\nThe Devs them selves continue to keep active in the forums and try to keep every thing as transparanet as possible they also have every few weeks live updates via Twich Tv, all of these you can watch on twitch which are good :)..\n\nI'll finish by saying although the game has plenty of bugs and still has a way to go, the Dev's continue to work hard on it and if they continue along this track there should be a very good game at the end the like of which there is not that many of this type in the market as it stands","May 24, 2014","true","32.6"," 84 of 127 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","84","127","0","0"

If you like sandbox and citybuilding games with RPG elements set in a fantasy world, this is the game for you.\n\nHow will it work?The way it's planned to be played is simple, but pretty intersting at the same time: there will be different zones, the Grassland, the Swamp and the Snow zone are already in the game. Desert and Lava zones are also planned. Each zone will have two opposing races driven by the AI, the Swamp has Goblins and Toads, for example. You'll be able to build your village, explore the world (yes, there won't be just a map, but multiple maps with different zones connected to each other like in RPGs) and choose to ally with one of the two races to try and plot against the other. All of this while you try to build a solid economy (the game has countless resources and multiple economy chains, like wheat -> flour -> bread). You can also explore dungeons, where you can find loot of differents rarities to equip your units with. It's a sandbox game, but it will also have campaign elements thanks to the questing system introduced with the Workbench: different characters will give you quests to complete, which will grant you different rewards, from a quest item to a new hero that decides to join your cause. What's even better is that you will be able to download and play maps that have been created by the players, using the Game Editor (which already contains almost 1200 pieces to create anything you want) and there are already a bunch of them! The hand-painted objects and textures give a tale-like look to each of those maps.\nAs you may have noticed, Folk Tale is not meant to be a war simulator, instead it focuses more on the lives of your folks. Indeed you'll be able to see each peasant's needs and working efficiency and decide if you want to satisfy them or let them get sick and leave the village.\nTo make a summary: this game will be HUGE.\n\nWhat can I do right now?At the current stage you can:\nPlay the tutorial: the new tutorial introduced in Patch 0.3 will make sure you know the fundamentals to build a solid and efficient village. It's very concise and simple and all the narrator's dialogues are beautifully voice acted.\nPlay the CAMPAIGN: Patch after patch, the campaign is gradually being implemented and already looks fun and witty (not even close to complete though). You can expect it to have cutscenes, full voice acting and the possibility to influence the course of the story through the choices you make when the game is complete, right now there are only a few of these things. (The reason why I put campaign on capital letters is that it wasn't initially planned, but many folks asked for it and we eventually got it!)\nPlay sandbox mode: Sandbox features are alaso available in Campaign, of course. I will use this section to also talk about the game in general.there are enough buildings, professions and resources to build your own village and manage its economy. After the addition of villagers' needs in patch 0.2.11 and building tier upgrades in patch 0.3, I can safely say it's now very playable and fun. I had a blast playing the Snow Tundra map: while I was trying to make sure my peasants had enough food (food variety is an important need) and clothes I also had to deal with the constant waves of wolves in search for food trying to kill all my citizens. After an hour of playing (and struggling), I realized I still had to start exploring the map, especially that massive monastery up ahead; they say it's full of monks...\nThe tutorial takes place in the Grasslands map, but there are also 3 maps made by the devs ready to be played and each one shows a different biome: the Stinking Swamp, the Howling Tundra and the WIP Crypt dungeon. They're all filled with enemies and locations which will keep you entertained for some hours. When you're done, you should definetely check out the other maps created by the players in this section.\nCreate your own map: before going full steam ahead on developing actual gameplay, the devs took the time to develop the game's editor, which is available right now and with whom you can create your own map, like many players have already done. There are TONS of objects and terrain tiles and it used to be a bit hard to place them one by one. Fortunately, the terrain sculpting tool makes it so much easier to build the map of your dreams.\nCreate your own quests: integrated within the game's editor, the Workbench is Folk Tale's powerful quest designer. One thing I love about games is the possibility to create my own stories and  here you can create almost every quest you like, where everything you want may happen, without having any code knowledge at all. It might take some time to learn how to use it, but trust me, it's worth it. It works with nodes: If player builds cottage, pop up dialog "Well done!". Yes, the tutorial was created using the Workbench. There are hundreds of nodes to cover an immense range of events. I especially like how you can make it so someone comes to your village and asks for your help, then you can decide if you want to help him or not and both answers will have different consequences. Same as when you decide to help a faction: the opposing one will most likely become your enemy. Everything that happens can be decided by the map's creator, so just think about the infinite possibilities a player can have.\n\nThis game is worth the money right now and, considering all the content that will be in the game when it is released, I can't see any reasons for not getting it now.","November 14, 2014","true","223.2"," 154 of 252 people (61%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","61","154","252","6","2"

I hope the campaign mode comes back. (Unless of course I'm thinking of a completely different game).\n\nI'll review the game as it stands currently. There are fairly regular updates which is important for early access. But generally it doesn't feel like much progress is being made. Game still very buggy and unbalanced. There are like 5 basic sandbox maps (inc. tutorial).\n\nWhile the general "Early Access" issues are forgiveable, so far gameplay wise there are a few week points:\n1) Combat needs serious work\n2) AI, why can't the city watch proactively defend the village?\n3) Managing soldiers, and their items (and managing items in general) is janky as hell.\n4) Managing your villagers is rather difficult, in that you have to go to each individual building, a general overview of idle workers and stuff and their statuses would be cool.\n\nThe art style is gorgeous even if the graphics generally look a few years out of date, it's not competing with AAA titles though so that's not too much of an issue.\n\nAlso, I discovered that the camera is actually useable if you hold shift while moving it. It actually moves at a decent speed. Cool feature, wish it was more obvious.\n\nI like it, you may too.

To say that this game is currently not even close to the game I would like to play only serves to remind me that I very much want this game to be made.\n\nAs such my initial review is positive. It's never a good idea to shoot down the developers of good ideas. Folktale is a good idea\n\nWith my review of the dream of the finished product out of the way, I'll now proceed with my ill-informed review of the current game based on the one time that I sat down and played it far closer to sunrise than I had intended.\n\nDesignAs is apparent to anyone who has seen the screenshots, the content for this game is fantastically designed. While the style, particularly the hand-drawn textures, is reminiscent of the dozens of Warcraft descendents, the characters and environments still have a fresh, unique feel to them. At no point did I ever feel that the content side of this game wasn't delivering. Top of the alphabet!\n\nGameplayThe gameplay is where my dreams have yet to materialize. At the time of this writing, you'll actually be able to experience two separate games upon launching the Early Access. The first is a tutorial written and programmed on what must be an earlier yet more complete version of the game. Your main concerns with this version will actually be the lack of freely placed structures and the unusual lack of the standard RTS right clicking.\n\nAfter finishing the tutorial you will be stunned to realize that the sandbox game is actually a significantly updated version of the tutorial, adding both of those features as well as a plethora of new UI elements and ways to control the game. Suddenly the game you thought might be close to finished has a long way to go but has so much more potential.\n\nLater, after you've forgotten how excited you were twice already, you'll slowly realize that you have no idea what you're doing. The game's economy has no balance; the population is refilled automatically as part of a short-cut to make the game playable; enemies don't have any way to spawn after you've defeated them once; leveling structures isn't implemented yet; leveling characters is currently useless; the item menu is buggy; there is no way to save; and several really important features are buried in the UI and left unexplained.\n\nWhat's important to my expectations of this game, however, is that most of the features of the game have been noted and exist as hollow buttons. I have no trouble seeing the game that this will be and every window has been designed carefully. The only things that I see that have been rushed are the ones necessary for the game to run.\n\nInterfaceThe interface is unexpectedly confusing. The game launches from a few different menus since it is, in fact, two iterations of the same game. None of the menus have back buttons to the main menu so I found myself quitting and reloading a few times at first. Probably the most frustrating thing is that I can't visualize the economy in any meaningful way. My best guess was to build one of everything and assign the maximum number of people to each structure. There are very complex UI elements in place to describe, in fancy percentages and statistics, exactly what is going on in any structure. Unfortunately the game runs to quickly to justify the time it takes me to grasp and micromanage these features.\n\nControlling the workforce is also annoying because the player currently orders citizens to work in certain places rather than ordering a building to hire a certain number of citizens (as in Tropico). If people aren't happy in your village, they'll leave without warning you which post they abandoned, creating holes that lead to more unhappiness and more holes. If you're off exploring the map, you might come back to discover that your whole town has unraveled and no one is working at all (an amusing byproduct of the Early Access release).\n\nAnyway, it looks as if a large portion of the UI is in place but currently does nothing so I have no real complaints. There is an economy window with no function and there are two or three extra features to extend the game that either aren't forward enough or that you just don't realize exist (science and crafting).\n\nI expect that lots of streamlining will be done along the way and the vast majority of the things I've noticed are far too obvious to be accidental. Features will be implemented and, when enough of them are stable, the devs will start paying attention to the desperate need for balance. Until then, I'm content leaving Folktale in my library for a future date.","December 5, 2014","true","5.6"," 113 of 186 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","113","186","0","0"

This is not something a lot of early access developers will put effort into doing so I'm very satisfied with supporting this game. The early access pricing might put off some people, but in my honest opinion I think the money is being used well and the developer isn't making lots of empty promises but actually delivering weekly/semi-monthly content and bug fixes.\n\nRecently played this game and I really like the addition of the research system and the dungeon-crawl-esque instances.

A lot has changed in development but I'm not even remotely disappointed.

They've taken the advice and suggestions of their players and gone from a stiff but lighthearted citybuilter to something considerably more organic and immersive (and they maintained both the beautiful style and pluck of the initial concept as they did).\n\nI was concerned back in the earliest builds that they'd make some ridiculous blunder and have the job assignments strictly gendered.

It had potential, yet that potential has gone nowhere. The game is no closer to being finish now as it was then.\n\nThe amount of progress in this early access is nearly neglibile compared to what other developers have done in early access. You can find dozens and dozens of similar complaints, more than other early access games. In fact this is one of them early access games that has given early access games a bad repuation about producing results.\n\nThere is a lot of complaints on why this game has taken so long. I can tell you exactly why that is. The developer is too busy playing with social media than producing results in the game. Think about how many hours a week a developer spends playing with social media, now multiply that by four for a month, then ten times that for a year. That is a lot of lost manhours for what?\n\nAbout six months ago the developer deleted one my posts in the forums. It was a topic where someone was bashing the game the game and throwing insults. My post was deleted yet the topic remained unlocked and the posts with insults by the troll were allowed to remain.\n\nThen last weekend I run across this topic when trying to find out why towers stopped working and if these quests in the campaign are implented yet.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/224440/discussions/0/364040961436251211/?ctp=2\n\nThe original poster was allowed to insult people giving the game a bad review repeatedly. I spoke up about how it was wrong to trivialize the terrorist attack tragedies and compare the developers to being the terroist victims. The fact a developer was involved in that topic and allowed the post to remain made it even worse. My post saying it was wrong and offensive to use a terrorism comparison was deleted, yet the post making the comparison was allowed to remain.\n\nIt could probably be a good game if the developers stopped trying to be social media stars and did their real jobs, producing video games. If you think I am wrong take a look at some of your favorite games and see exactly how much social media interact those developers do, not much if at all.\n\nThis is definitely one of them early access titles you do not touch until the game is completed. Even then I would be wary because at the rate of development you can be pretty sure the game will be released too soon (funding issues) and will be full of bugs to be patched later.","May 11","false","24.8"," 37 of 59 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","37","59","2","5"

And finally a forgiving game that goes at a relaxed pace.\nThe score is lovely, the humour a little cheesy but not overly cringworthy. And some darker choices in the campaign are great to see and follow.\nPlacing buildings feels good and they look gorgeous and unique when upgraded. It can get expensive, but its perfectly feasible to knockdown and rebuild structures when the village grows and you want to replan.\nThe RPG level on your heroes and villagers is minimal but in my opinion just the right level. At first I didn't want to micro-manage all their equipment, and I could (seemingly) safely ignore it, but I found myself eventually drawn to and actually enjoying it.\n\nSomething I love about it is the way the ground you slowly expand over still feels alive and natural. Your woodcutters automatically plant saplings as well as fell trees - so there are always trees growing in the town. The hunters still find and hunt animals on your grounds as well. And the villagers go absolutely all over the place, which looks great, all with their own needs (like hunger and new clothes), even delivering firewood to cottages which I thought was a nice touch.\n\nAnd it's great to zoom out after a number of hours see how your village has become a huge, fortified town.\n\nROUGH EDGES\n\nStill some rough edges, obviously. But not had any crashes or game killing bugs. Just a few wtf moments where things haven't been implemented, aren’t obvious, or the where the campaign isn't finished.\nVillagers can lose their gear when you start reassigning jobs, which calls for a bit more micro-management.\nAnd it needs an easier way to distribute clothing and gear to the masses. Although this in itself isn't really necessary, but it's nice to know your villagers are as protected as they can be.\nCombat is fun, but a little weak at the moment; I think it mainly needs a lot more audio.\nAnd overall it needs a bit of balancing here and there. At the moment, if anything, it's all too easy.\n\nDEVS\n\nI only just came in at the end of March 16. I looked at the Negative reviews first, and it seems that many of them are complaints at development time. Fair enough, I have a few games on my shtilist that have taken an age and I thoroughly regret backing. And this might of been one had I found it years ago.\nBut, judging this game on it's current merits, I think it deserves a much higher rating.\nJudging the devs is another thing and maybe they deserve the knock - But thankfully not for me to argue or care about.\n\n---------------\n\nAt the end of the day this is a great game in the making. I want to see this game complete.\nThis, to me, is one of those EA games where all the problems are positive ones: I just want more of it: more hero's, more gear, building animations, deeper combat, more to do in town. I can't think of anything to really complain about, want removing or drastically changing at this point.\nIt's more than just a great foundation, it just needs a more content and polish.\nMost certainly worth it in a sale if you're unsure.","April 1","true","22.4"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","20","28","0","0"

Once villagers become unhappy, they start leaving and they won't stop. This requires more balancing, as once they start leaving, businesses start to empty, thereby reducing the production of things that keep villagers happy, which reduces unhappiness even more and causes more villagers to leave.\n\nBasically when unhappiness outweighs happiness, you're  screwed. The only way to really counteract this is prior knowledge of when villagers desire what. So here is an important pro-tip:\n\nAt 30 population, your villagers will demand new clothing, and at 40 population, they will demand mead. So try your best to prepare these industries in advance before hitting the population mark, otherwise you will be crushed by unhappiness. The game itself is becoming great, but the unhappiness mechanic really guts your village when it takes effect.","January 16","true","3.1"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

Every character has his own level progression and loadout, and it's gonna be a Sandbox game which is awesome. BUT, since the release in may 2013 the devellopers haven't added anything besides the save and load feature and a few bug fixes. I know games aren't created over night but I thought the point of Early Access was, at least according to Steam, that you buy a game for a low price, you get to play it AND see the game evolve, but nothing really changed since the release. The devellopers are still working on it though because they release "dev blogs" every now and then and some youtube video's to show us what they did. So what's included in the game when you buy it in it's current state, a tutorial which takes about 1-2 hours to finish, thats pretty much it.\n\nIf one of the devellopers is reading this here's some advise that will statisfy most players; add the map editor, we might not be able to do anything with the maps we created but at least we get to play around with it. And maybe you should add showcases like they did in ArmA III, like small quests that can be started through the main menu to show some new monsters, enemies and features. I'm not a develloper but I cannot imagine it would be hard to do, and you will regain some trust with the people who have forgotten about the game or lost faith in it because they didn't see anything change for months.\n\nSo should you buy it, if you like the concept, yes. It might only have tutorial for now (and you should keep in mind when you buy it that it might be like that for another few months) but as the game grows bigger the game will become more expensive. And to be honest, it's probably the best and most fun tutorial I've ever played so the game should be great when it's released.\n\nEDIT: The developer told me in the comment section that we'll get a preview of the location editor during the christmas patch!!!","November 27, 2013","true","5.7"," 92 of 160 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","92","160","0","2"

However this review will focus only on the current game, versus the price point of $24.99.\n\nI think this game, in it's current state, is very fun. There are a few bugs here and there, but nothing gamebreaking. honestly this is how I would have expected it to be years ago, but that's beside the point.\n\nThe gameplay reminds me of sim city crossed with Banished, and World of Warcraft. The graphics are very immersive and the townspeople have a quirky charm to them. The map feels expansive enough to me, and there is a real feeling of mystery in the land. Your town may be peaceful for days and days then out of nowhere spiders are attacking.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\n\nThe world feels like it's really alive, and this is a fantastic sandbox play. My problem is the price point. I'm very glad I bought the game years back and it finally ended up being playable, however for an early access game of this genre $24.99 is pretty steep. Most games like this I have been playing and liking even more lately are around 10-15 bucks.

As with all beta, there were a ton of bugs and issues and so I put it back on a shelf until it was more polished. I think people have to realize that when something's in beta, it WILL have issues. If you're judging an entire game before actual release, you need to adjust your expectations as such.\n\nThat said, I just opened up the game yesterday after shelving it for more than a year, and wow. I'm quite impressed with the changes. This game has a little something for everyone.\n\nIt works on the same principle as other sim building games -- where you set up a village, nurture its growth by adding food supplies, shelter, and defense -- but it's so much much more than just your basic sim build.\n\nEach of the various buildings you can place in your village are upgradeable, require specific sets of values (happy peasants, enough wood, etc) to upgrade, but you can ALSO spend resources learning specialized tricks for each trade - your blacksmith learns how to make plate, your tavern learns how to host a mead festival (and brothel! oh my!) -- each building and the workers in them are part of a giant cog that makes your village work.\n\nOnce you research tricks for your trade, you can actually craft items. Yes, I said craft items. You can equip your peasants with tougher gear so they can fend off invasions of spiders or other enemies. You can make regular cloth or silk, plate armour or swords -- the choice is up to you.\n\nBUT THAT'S NOT ALL!\n\nYou also get your own "hero." A goofy, loveable type, he ventures out into the world to fight the invading forces, collect resources and discover loot. He levels up like you expect in a traditional MMO, and gains experience, stats and strength.\nThose with OCD for building sims and building sims only may have some trouble multi-tasking -- the resources your "hero" collects are necessary for some town upgrades/builds -- but it makes this game so much more complex than your traditional RPG or city builder.\n\nMy first day back playing, I lost 10 hours to the game. That's the first time a game so engrossed me in such a long time.\n\nThe pros:\n\n* You can create a bustling village, complete with its own economy (heck, you can fill your citizens up with mead and have them drunk all the time, so they don't complain about taxes).\n* Each industry (mining, tailor, bakery, farm, blacksmith, tavern, etc) is fully upgradeable. With each upgrade unlocking new skills.\n* Each industry has specialized knowlege to learn; unlocking different abilities.\n* Each sim resident can be geared up with items you craft.\n* Your hero explores the rest of the map, fights enemies and comes home with loot.\n\nThe cons:\n* While the humor is great in this game, the narrator can be a tiny bit grating at times. He's especially gleeful and sullen when your villagers get upset and leave. Bit of a drama llama :)\n\nThe game is absolutely worth buying, particularly if you love sim building and RPG. I haven't seen any other game out there quite like it.\n","April 3","true","22.3"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

You can also produce items/gear to equip your heroes (and citizens) with.

I normally get burned out on RTS games, and I'm not great at those. I adore this game. The storyline keeps things interesting. I can switch back and forth between building up my town and exploring a dungeon. Before I break down the individual aspects, I'll say this: This game is currently early access. The storylines are not complete. If you go into this, knowing that this game is unfinished and constantly progressing, you will be way happier.\n\nOkay, we'll start with the resource management aspect of this game. There are a lot of buildings to place that tie into other buildings. For example, in order to make clothes for your people, you need a weaver, cotton fields, and a tailor. There are items that you can equip to your workers depending on their profession. You can research things for each building (except the cottages); an example would be that you can expland the boundary on the windmill, which increases the space for crops. The people can either be assigned manually, or you can have them automatically accomplish tasks. As far as resource management games go, this one has a lot of little things that make it charming. I adore the fact that you can equip people with the items you find and loot.\n\nOn the RPG side of things, you start the game with a hero, Ser Gregory. There are other heroes that you can have join forces. When it comes to the dungeon runs (sounds like a digestive issue) you fight bad guys, you loot chests and barrels, you fight bosses, you get lost, you try not to get killed. They're everything you could ask for from a dungeon run. The equipment items you find have stats that affect your heroes. Certain items come in common and rare. What they have planned for loot and magical items is really exciting. Ser Gregory has special attacks he can do, the power slam, which affects the baddies that are right in front of him. There is a shield bash, and some defensive abilities. I believe each of the heroes will have specific abilities. The storyline has different paths you can take. The animations are really fantastic, and the amount of detail that goes into everything is staggering. As of right now, there are two branches of the story. You can investigate the gladefolk (which is a gorgeous, newer addition) or you can locate the sandal factory. I am really excited for where the story will go from here.\n\nLike I mentioned before, this game is still early access, so there will be waiting for certain things. I strongly reccomend trying this game out. I personally love the excitement of updates. It's like exploring the same game over and over again. I also really like that this game has a sandbox mode and a world editor.\n\n;TLDR Early release game combines RTS and RPG succesfully.

I often look through the Steam lists for games like this (because I enjoy this kind of thing) but I can honestly say I have found nothing to compare with Folk Tale's general standard of excellence and with this developers dedication and refusal to compromise on excellence. Even though it's not yet finished there is still a reasonable amount of content and more being added all the time.\n\nLet me also mention the editing tools that come with the game and are improving all the time. I have almost 900 hours on this game and the vast majority of that time has been spent using the Editor. There will be a keen group of Workshop map makers who will gaurantee the longevity of Folk Tale so we need never run out of content.\n\nYes, I have seen some of the negative reviews and frankly most of them are simply garbage.

She can’t decide if Warcraft 3, The Settlers, or Banished is the father, and she is only in the first trimester so it’s impossible to tell currently, but she does have a name already picked out for the child; Folk Tale.\n\nEarly Access:\nCurrently this game is in early access. Why is this important to say when that should be obvious? Because there are those, ah hell who am I kidding, MOST “gamers” don’t know what the hell that means apparently.  Early access games can take six months, they can take five years, they might never be finished; picture it is like a kick starter but the dev is nice enough to give you free copies of their beta’s and alpha’s as they build the game. This is not a completed game and it may never be a completed game. A dev company can promise to “complete said game” but that is all it is, a promise, there is nothing legally speaking they have to do other than slap a “1.0” sticker on the game (Craft the World) and walk away. People need to know that and understand that going into any EA game.\n\nThe Game Vision\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzDTbp4aXX8\n\nThe Game Currently (May 13th):\nCurrently the game has a tutorial and basically what I would describe as “Beta Maps”, four of them, which take anywhere from five to ten hours each to really enjoy. That means you are talking about twenty to forty hours of gameplay if you just gave each of their maps a real shot. Don’t look at “how many hours” people have put into the game, many have put far more hours into the game than it says on Steam as for some reason the hours are just not clicking over correctly (offline mode possibly?).\n\nThe three more sandbox style maps (Easily labeled on the side as easy/medium/hard) basically are set up just like most RTS games, you have a couple villagers and some supplies and build from there. Unlike most RTS games however (Other than Banished for some reason… for the life of me I don’t know why that game gets the reviews it does) Folk Tale currently does not have an “endgame”, ie. killing the enemy base, completing the mission, etc. Basically you build you city, survive and run amok as long as you desire/ can survive (ie. Banished) and that is that.\n\nAnyone who has played the Stronghold games will find this game strangely familiar, even the voice acting. The same style of walls, buildings, humor, villagers are not produced they just “appear” if you have the houses to support them and the happiness to attract them, etc. If I were to sum up the game currently I would say it is 50% Stronghold (Economy/Buildings/ Defensive Structures/Audio/Troops), 25% Settlers 7 (Economy Chains/Buildings/Villigers), 20% Warcraft 3 (Fantasy world/Combat), and 5% Banished (Possible sandbox?). (That’s a 100% right? Good…) If they threw together a random map generator and multiplied the map size by at least 3x this game would dwarf Banished in its content alone.\n\nThe combat is vastly different from Stronghold, in favor of what I see as the developers taking a page from Warcraft 3. Instead of vast, vast armies you now command a smaller crew (with heroes in the works) that can all be personally equipped with gear and upgraded as they level up. I am assuming they will have a “Hall of Heroes” style building like Warcraft to bring your heroes back from the grave- hasn’t been implemented yet.\n\nThe Problem:\nIt is so hard to understand the minds and predict the mood swings of gamers today, I would dare say it might be impossible, and at the very least it is clearly the most difficult time I can recall- and I have been in gaming a long time. Call me sexiest if you must but when did gamers start acting like a bunch of girls thinking with their woman parts more than with their brains? Basically all you have now are angry fan boi’s- I know, I get in trouble for bringing this up over and over again, but it is just sadly the truth!- and all they do is evaluate a game or a developer emotionally and then damn the facts. This game is absolutely no different. You have a group of people who didn’t like “not getting their way” in a vote that happened apparently years ago and because of that one event and how it made them “feel” they grouped up and went to war, the game itself be damned “I just don’t like the fact I didn’t get 100% of my way when I contributed a drop in that bucket!” Looking at the facts, logically, with a clear mind, I ask “how could any developer making a game in early access please every single person who signs on and supports them in early access?” and then I ask “how would you make sure that the majority of what your early access contributors are asking for, you are providing?” and I dare say that you will not come up with a better solution than what this developer did- vote and follow the vote. So looking at this logically, with your head, I ask “why hurt much?”\n\nWhy do “gamers” now go through reviews and upvote and downvote purely off of if they recommended or did not recommend, the review itself be damned? Why do “gamers” now overlook countless flaws, countless bugs, countless AI failures, pay to play/win/continue features in a game purely because “the developer… giggle*, is my friend!” (God, I am looking at you Banished/Creativerse) while at the same time these same “gamers” take dumps on games that have more content, less bugs, better AI, and no pay to play/win/continue features in their game just because something or someone “rubbed them the wrong way”? The problem? Gamers need to start putting the game first (Thank you Divinity Original Sin) and put their emotions in their purses, loyalty to a developing company be damned! (Who is Larian Studios anyways?)\n\nBottom Line:\nSo basically if you think you would enjoy a game that would have the combat and fantasy style world like that of Warcraft 3 while having the economy and base building of a Stronghold then I would strongly recommend supporting this game as I have not seen anything similar in years (Warcraft 4 is basically every modern day MOBA, no thanks, and the new Stronghold was a step back in every sense of “step back”) and I don’t know when or if you’ll see anymore. I have played AAA titles that were not as fined tuned as this game currently is, and those games have sold for over $50. The developers of Folk Tale are claiming that they are still a long ways off from where they want to end up- that should impress and scare most of us.\n\nIf you would like to see my thoughts on other games or movies check out my blog which you can find in my Steam profile or by google, search Ashley and Micah English.

The storyline in the campaign is getting  on greatly and the recent updates make the game even more playable, The resource managment + Ciry building aspecs and loot collecting add a Sim City / Diablo feel to the game which personally I feel is amazing, The merging off the two genres gives the game something very special!

It is great to be apart of the build and give my thoughts and ideas as it grows. I enjoy playing beta games and have played many different games in progress. The reason I like that is because you get to put feedback into the game so the developers can get improve the game in a way that will be fun for everyone and also have a wide variety ways of playing because many of us have different styles of playing.

It uses a similar system than most RPG, for example like World of Warcraft.\n\nRegarding exploring:\n- Folks Tale has a game breaking new feature:\nYour map is actually just a part of a whole world. You can take your heroes, all with special skillable abilities to other places.\n- There are desserts, dungeons, swamps, boss fights, snow lands.\n- Each map has allies or enemies, you can choose to smelt alliances.\n\nWhy did this game stay in early access for a long time?\n- Well the development team changed their plans aprox. 1 year ago from campain to sandbox. Since then the progress on sandbox has been enourmous and continued.\n\nHow is development doing at the moment:\n- The dev team is really hardworking. Everything they have on their dev roadmap is coming along well.\n- The dev team has a very clear strategy since they changed to sandbox\n- They even respond to the community in the forum within hours\n- They have Sunday Life streams where they present in over 2 hours !!! what they developed in the last 7 days.

Of course with some Warcraft (not World of Warcraft) RTS elements, such as champions, fighting, loot, etc.\nBut the "economy" is similar to what Settlers is.\n\nPROs:\n- Inspired by Settlers (probably)\n- Smooth building mode\n- Interesting "tree" of buildings and upgrades\n- The start phase of a new game is much more enjoyable than it looks like.\n\nCONs:\n- Sandbox has 3 levels of difficulty, one map per difficulty, so only 3 maps. You can't just start a game with a different layout and try to build it out. You always know the exact starting location. That's boring.

Just remember it's EARLY ACCESS dont buy it unless you want to help the dev's make a wonderfull little game, buying it expecting a polished product then knocking it will only snowball a problem that should not exsist. When ppl see all the bad reviews (mostly over the time it has taken, not the game itself)  it only knocks a game that is not even done yet and hurts the dev's and the process.","May 9","true","11.7"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","14","20","2","0"

It bothers me that people give this game poor reviews. It's an Early Access game!! There will be bugs! I'm sorry, but you're an idiot if you purchase an Early Access game and expect it to run perfectly.\n\nFirst and foremost, Folk Tale is (and will be) brilliant! It is exactly what I've been wishing for in a game. At the moment it's more or less just a city builder like Banished, except it will be so very much more when complete.\n\nThe realm is rich with detail, the humor edgy. It's been fun to watch this game come to life throughout the entire process. This game has so much potential it's hard to be patient while waiting for it to be complete. I've been hooked since I first purchased it, which was BEFORE any save was available.\n\nThe developers are much more transparent than any other EA games I have purchased, keeping us up to date on what is on task, sharing artwork for new features/characters/buildings etc that will be implemented in future patches. I don't know what the final price will be upon completion but I've definitely gotten my money's worth out of what exists right now.\nIf you're considering this game, ignore the haters. Most didn't even take the time to read the discussions or the Folk Tale blog. If they had, they woudln't have been wanking about half of the things they were.","February 28, 2015","true","416.8"," 50 of 88 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","50","88","0","2"

Living in an EXTREMELY rural area, I lose internet often and Steam tends to not recognize how much time I've been on this game.\n\nAnyway, I've had this game since a few months after it was released on Early Access, and I only have one thing to say about this game. SUPPORT IT!!\n\nThere are mixed reviews and I don't know why. After seeing so many Abandon Ware game from EA, I adore these devs. All they have done is listened to their players and upped their game every-single-time. If you don't agree, go to their dang website and see how much they do. Look on the forums here to see how often you can get a response from them. This game will truly be amazing when it is complete.\n\nTo keep this review from being pages long, I'll simply say this. This game in INCOMPLETE (Durr), but continually gets better. IT IS WORTH THE MONEY, because the price will only go up as it gets better. Buy now, support devs who care more about you than about pre-sales and enjoy watching a game as it develops; especially getting to be a part of having a voice in the development of this game.\n\nI definantly recommend this game to any and all.","December 9, 2014","true","5.9"," 42 of 73 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","42","73","0","0"

The devs of this game asked the community about a year ago if they preferred a sandbox or campaign mode. Most of the community chose sandbox so the entire game has been re-written the last year to acomplish that. We were told it would take awhile and now the foundation is complete so there will be updates more regularly. How many game developers do you know that will re-write the programming on a game they are developing to meet the wants of the community?  The devs of this game stay in constant contact with us on the forums and have not once failed to meet a promise they have made. Developement was slow at first but now is speeding up since the foundation is complete. This game IS worth your time and money. While its not near completion just yet it is getting there at a steady pace now. I personally have bought games on steam that the devs don't keep the community updated or leave the game broken and basically give up. If your one of those players who have had a similar experience  I can asure you that this game is different.\nIn fact I can promise you this is the most active development team I have ever seen in an early access game.

I have been watching since it first appeared and became extremely interested in it after watching some videos and visiting the developers' website.  I wrote a comment before I purchased the game and then waited til it was playable to buy it.\n\nFolk Tale is an immersive City Builder type game,  but with a twist of RPG and some of the real-time civ games I've played.  I really like the game overall.  It has great graphics (which are not my main point of interest), a deep building system and plenty to do while you're waiting on new villagers to arrive.  You can craft, battle, follow a guy or gal around and watch them work, lash the workers into a working frenzy, and even research upgrades on each of the buildings you've created.\n\nI cannot end this comment, however, without bringing to attention a few bugs I noticed in the most recent update--the experimental build which came out on Saturday.  First off, before this latest version, the battle system worked flawlessly, but now, I notice that not even Sir Gregory can damage the foes (like the goblins outside of the human woodland area or even the bandits at the beginning of the campaign).  This makes the campaign-mode unplayable again and further makes it lose some of its greatness in the sandbox mode.  I would recommend that the developers take the time to fix whatever could be causing the issue at once and then release another update (so I can kill things again!)   Also, the new happiness system is pretty cool.  It is MUCH BETTER than the old repeated warning about food supplies being low and such.  The only thing is, with the happiness system implemented, it is difficult (nearly impossible) to keep folks happy at the beginning of the game.  By the time you build a farm, a fishery and send a person off to gather up berries, the people are already leaving because of low food supplies.  I would say the easiest fix to this problem would be to change the amount of food each villager eats when they are hungry.  I know you can alter the 'rations' meter, but it just isn't enough to keep folks around.  Besides, making them eat less than they want to automatically makes them mad.  I even went as far as to give them extra amounts of firewood to offset the issue, but I could never draw in the new villagers I needed to make the town continue to grow.\n\nAnyway, I really love the game and will continue to watch for updates.  You guys are building a dynamic game here.  I know there are nay-sayers, but I think it's coming along well enough and offers quite a bit of humourous detail to offset the small downsides to the project.","October 29, 2015","true","11.7"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","13","19","0","0"

I've read the dev blogs and see that there are some improvements that truly sound interesting. I'm looking forward to having a bit of time to check out the updated version.

A city management/rpg hybrid. Like if Banished and Warcraft had a lovechild.\nThe game is in early access still, but so far plays pretty well. I love the overall aesthetic, and light-hearted approach to this. You're not going to find anything groundbreaking in terms of mythos. We have standard heroes, civilians, and creatures like orcs/wolves/spiders etc, here. But the originality lies in the merging of genres. I think it was clever to not break too many molds here: the familiarity makes the game accessible.\n\nI have encountered a game breaking bug, that seems to happen at random - is being ignored at the moment (unsure why. my guess is priorities)\n\nDO NOT LET THE "MIXED" REVIEW PURSUADE YOU\nthe negative reviews are based on issues that have long since been addressed and are no longer existent in the game.\n\nshould you buy it? YES. This game is already solid and the devs have all but proven they're committed to the cause. This is a wonderful merging of genres that hasn't seen the light of day since "Warlords: Battlecry" (released 15 years ago)\n\nPros:\n+easy to learn\n+great merging of genres\n+addictive and entertaining\n+your town IS able to become self-sufficient! (this is huge! and I hope they don't remove it. it's nice to be able to let your town go about it's business while you're off adventuring)\n+regularly updated\n\nCons:\n-still in development (which is clearly stated but that still means it's incomplete)\n-once you've built everything, stabalized resources, and cleared the map of chests, there's not a whole heck of a lot to do (see: my suggestions)\n-the occassional bug\n-lack of depth in leveling your hero\n\nUPDATE: I have about 8hrs of game time already, which is great! I'm not too interested in the campaign, mostly the sandbox mode. I've done everything there is to do in Sandbox mode. The only thing hindering this game's experience is a lack of "stuff".\n\nMy Suggestions:\n\n-More playable heroes (desperately)\n-bigger/better sandbox maps\n-caves/dungeons\n-random town-threatining events\n-some sort of wizarding or magic academy. train magic users for battle or even helpful things like enchanting crops so they yield more for a while, summon wild creatures so your hunters have a plentiful hunt, etc\n-maybe the ability to build "wonders" a la Civilization - a large, beneficial structure, that's very resource heavy but helps the town or your hero a great deal.\n-town notice board where citizens can ask the hero for assistance (basically a quest generator)","December 27, 2015","true","9.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","3"

This is an updated review from the one I wrote shortly after that.\n\nOne thing I must say: The development progresses constantly, with what appears to be a goal of polishing as it gets done. Nice work!\n\nPositive\n- It has a full editor to make lots of worlds, and dungeons that you can play in, or share online for others to play too!\n- There are 100's of free items to build with to make amazing looking worlds or dungeons\n- The game looks really polished and reminds me of Fable, with its hand painted artwork approach\n- If you play the tutorial, it is like a 3D version of a city management game, with crafting and building upgrades etc\n- You can move the camera anywhere in 3D, even following the peasants and workers around the village.\n- The game has been balanced, and is enjoyable to play.\n\nNegative\n- There is steady progress in the development, but it might appear that features are not moving along in strides.\n\nSummary\nBuy the game. I did. Why? To give this producer/coder, and his army of artists and other helpers, a bit of cash to hopefully in some years, get to a point beyond alpha. He has a great idea, and the helpers are doing what they can to support him. With a bit more cash, they might succeed and I really hope they do.\n\nAlso, if you buy the game, you get the sandbox tools (which is built into the game) for free, with 100s of items to build with and decorate your dungeons or landscapes. There is also an included visual script tool to make spawns, and quests and NPC dialogues.

A lot is drafted, but nothing is fleshed out. The game has good graphics and an immersive soundtrack. Other than that, there is not a lot to play with. Most of the production chains are useless. There is only one tier of armor, that merits the effort of making. None of the weapons are. While there are three diferent food production chains, which are not optional btw, you cannot really get a grasp of where you are standing with either of them. The hero is weaker than any basic arbalist (arbalists beeing the only military unit that do any good, having the ability to carry worthwhile armor).\n\nBasic mechanics, such as an hidden inventory slot for production and recruiting buildings are missing. This says a lot about the production value. The GUI as well.\n\nAs a summary i must sadly say, the game provides only a few hours of gameplay. One hour for the town and maybe three to get some walls around, since the mobs constantly respawn, basically the only way to get some peace for your settlers.\n\nI hope my review saves others the 20 EUR i spent, and is not regarded as an angry review. I play games for more than twenty years and i concern myself with quality and project management for a living.\n\n@Devs: If you are willing to fill the games basic mechanics with life, which would be probably an undertaking of mere hours, i am sure you will get better reviews. Rather than putting effort in the misleading advertisements, reconsider what is needed to move the project along.\n\n9/10 for the idea and concept\n2/10 for realisation","November 24, 2015","false","6.3"," 85 of 157 people (54%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","54","85","157","6","13"

This game is by far one of my most highly praised games among all of the ones I own. I personally do not rate games highly unless they either have great potential and are living up to the expectation, or delivered on exactly what I desired and sometimes more. This game while in early form, has a great location editor and sandbox foundation, as well as the development team is transparent with the community giving us updates on the game's status and what we can expect. While many people rated this game down, it has come a long way from what it used to be, with more frequent updates, blogs, and responses to the community. I have never had to wait longer than 3 hours when I posted in the forum asking a question or making some form of a comment. This game has been delivering on everything they promised and continue to listen to the community. I would highly suggest this game if you are even remotely interested by what their vision for the outcome is!","June 1, 2014","true","21.2"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

However because this should be about whether or not I reccomend the game to new buyers I've decided to change my original review to a positve one. Folk Tale now has a very clear goal in it's continued development as an early access game. With an art style remeniscent of Fable and gameplay like that of Black and White it's good fun to play for a few hours at a time making use of each new update and keeping track of the development bloggs. If your new to the game you'll know what they are offering you from the trailers and enjoy it for those reasons.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yesaja/recommended/224440/","yesaja","Yesaja","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yesaja/","222 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOnce upon a time, there was... a game, which stood in the Alpha-status for far too long regarding its reputation.\n\nI'm really conflicted about Folk Tale, to be honest. I bought it right after its release on Steam to support the development, because - as I thought - it handled a niche with a lot of potential. I played the tutorial, participated in a vote about what monsters are to be implemented (sadly, my nagas and lamias didn't make it) and regulary read the development blog. But this is about an honest review, about the question if (and if or if not, why) I'd recommend this game: The answer, at the current state, would be no.\n\nMany people here noted the time-span, in which Folk Tale has been... well, "released" on Steam and this is fairly a good point. But I'm not concerned about the actual release of the Sandbox mode, but rather about the support AFTER it's release and the frequency of implenetation regarding new ideas. Take the example from above: When do I get the chance to play Nagas and Lamias, actually? Will there be any chance? Will there be another game after Folk Tale (a question, none developer could answer honestly, at that point, no offense) and if so, what happens to this one?\n\nAt the moment, Folk Tale is just neither red nor blue. There are a lot of promises, only a few backed up by ingame content. And such, there has been no reason for an investor, to trust in this product (as said, at the moment). If - and only if - there will be a full playable sandbox mode (which isn't buggy as hell with enough "managing a whole fantasy town in a strange world"-atmoshpere), you should definetly check this out.\n\nUntil then, keep your hands by your money and wait, as those do, who have spend their money.","June 14, 2014","false","3.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xerxys/recommended/224440/","xerxys","xerxys","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xerxys/","97 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHaving watched this game for a while, I boticed that the reviews had taken an upswing recently, so finally purchased. Whilst it is an entertaining game with some very lofty ideals and far-reaching concepts, many of these have either not been fully implemented yet, or they need a lot of polish and balancing. But even as it stands, the game is playable and enjoyable, albeit frustrating at times. Yes, it has been EA for a long time, but this is a game slowly forming and maturing and can only improve with the more interest and input and backing it receives. I do recommend this game to others, but the biggest negatives thus far:\n\n* No in-game pause. There is a lot to do in the game, but it all has to be done in real time, and many of the micromanagement elements (talked about later) are left undone as you rush around, trying to keep everything going, especially in the early game. You can stop the game by opening the settings menu, but you're unable to do anything\n* Combat is very unformed. Without the pause function to regroup and refocus troops, you often find yourself throwing everything you can at enemies, with your heroes lost in the very early game, with no way (that I've so far found) to revive or replace them. Enemies also tend to wander in a little too often at times, often undoing lots of hard work.\n* Building placement and world interaction is pretty basic. Building placement is touchy (to say the least), with every building requiring quite a bit of space, or just refusing to go into places you would excpect it to go. So far, there's also no way to remove or add any in-world items beyong buildings, either. This results in a wide spread of buildings placed down with little thought, just wherever they'll fit; and with no roads and no decorations, there is little visual cohesion to help turn it into a real town.\n*Micromanagement needs to be dropped or nerfed until it's more fully-formed. The RPG elements of leveling up, making and finding better equipment, researching new things for buildings is great, but there's so much to do and precious little time. Did I mention there's no workable pause yet? Pretty sure I did. Defeating a group of enemies can result in some little bits of armor that your workers can use, or you can begin crafting armor and weapons for troops and workers, but these have to be handed out individually, piece by piece, a tedious process you quickly tire of. There seems to be no way to queue research for buildings and upgrading buildings can be a really expensive option for (at the moment) little gain in many cases.\n\nIt sounds bad, I know, but I do recommend this game. It's playable, it's enjoyable and it is slowly coming together. Many other people have complained about the lack of a serious campaign so far, but, for my tastes, I would much rather they focus on getting the city-building and micromanagement elements streamlined and rock-solid, then they can begin to flesh out campaigns and really bring the RPG elements to life. There's so much potential here and the developers are moving in the right direction. I just hope they don't lose faith in the game before it's done.","November 13, 2015","true","4.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

The graphics are so cool, and the way the people go about their business...I just love watching them. Then you have the exploration with the hero side of it. That just adds more fun things to do. Quests, dungeons, fighting off intruders, etc.\n\nIf you're on the fence, I will tell you that I definitely don't regret the purchase. If it takes a long time to add even more awesome features to the game, I hope they do it. It will just up the replayability value, in my opinion.\n\nThe game is completely playable from what I've seen, and I've played it for almost 4 hours straight with no bugs, glitches, DCs, or weirdness at all.

The game has a lot of promise and potential. I love the concept, the art and the design, but it has not reached that potential as of yet. The game has the city building (basics) pretty much down, but lacks most of the RPG/RTS features and deeper management aspects as of the moment. Beyond that, the game doesn't have very much to do once you get the buildings built and supply/production chains established, which is why the game is not at its peak.\n\nI am still recommending it because I've noticed that the developers are very active, appreciative and humble, implementing user ideas/suggestions and being very open with their community. I also feel that the game has a lot of potential to be something great.","December 31, 2015","true","1.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

I had to say I was getting mad at this game for waiting so long to do anything. At first the tutorial (like 2 years ago whew!)  was fun enough to buy. It was like Settlers 7 with a bit of on rails exploration. But unlike the massive steps back Settlers 7 took in placing things and game play, Folktale stepped forward and took the exploration off the rails and allowed free placement of buildings. You are going in the right dirrection!! I would say it is a mash of the the good old Settlers where you actually got to build your town, combined with a bit of Diablo-esk exploration and game play.

For people who like RPG, Action, Adventure, and building cities, this game is for you. Just note that it is in Early Access right now so there will be quite a few bugs and uneeded features. But aside from all of that, It is really fun to build a town, gather resources, upgrade structures, Battle against lots and lots of great enemies. Now, of course there is one huge downside to this game. As your progress, and as you build a huge and incredible Town, It starts to get boring. All of your structures end up being completely upgraded, everything is complete, and your end up with nothing to do. The worlds that players spawn in are only so big. they should be bigger though. Bigger worlds for building on, More enemies to take out, Stronger enemies to brawl with, More harder assults on your village from enemies. Everything becomes a bit too easy as your town becomes stronger and stronger.\nSo those are my thoughts on the game. There are many ups, and many downs.

The scope and ambition of this game is mighty impressive. Not coincidentally, it has been in development for years. The updates give me hope that development will progress at a decent pace.\n\nIt's very similar to the Settlers series, which is fine by me. Build up your villages with plenty of building and technology options, and meanwhile explore the map and slay enemies with your main hero and pals you find along the way.\n\nThe UI has some bits that could use some tweaking, to be certain. At least some shortcut keys exist but aren't indicated anywhere (e.g. 'I' shows inventory, with a hero selected 'C' brings up the character sheet, etc.)  Minor glitches are here and there, but thus far don't really detract too much from the game.\n\nThe biggest issue (at least with this latest build) is that the village population is extremely spiky: one minute, everybody's fat and happy, next minute you lose 80% of your people. As you hit different levels of "culture" the needs of the village increase, and this causes the unhappiness. Again, not a show stopper - once you drop down in culture (because of the exodus) the needs decrease, happiness increases and you're back where you were. Rinse & repeat.\n\nIf you're a fan of the Settlers, this is buy in my book. 8/10 overall at this stage, but time will tell whether the content will be there.","December 20, 2015","true","11.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Graphics are nice for the look the game is going for and it runs smoothly. It's got a helpful tutorial that will walk you through setting up a small village and teach you all the controls. It's definately more of a building and town management game right as combat is sparse in sandbox mode. Only the combat I've seen is  the occational bear that wanders too close to my hunters and the rat men that were guarding the iron mine close to the starting point. I'm sure it picks as you progress, and the campaign has more fighting if that's what you want.\n\nMy biggest complaint is villager management. It's easy enough to assign villagers to a role through the building recruitment dialog, but there's no way that I've seen to select them from the overhead view without just clicking straight on them. It's hard to tell who's who unless you've learned to recognize the outfits at a glance and equiping individual villagers is an outright pain in the you know what. The only way to assign villagers to combat is to box select them, which is not ideal as you may be sending poorly equiped villagers to die while your axe-weilding woodsmen and bow-sporting hunters carry on like nothing's wrong. I'd prefer to see a window with all your guys in it similar to what a lot of RTSs have or at least the ability to set groups that can be selected with a single button click.\n\nAgain, though, it's in good shape for an Early Access game, and they update on a regular basis.

It's unfortunate, but with small developers taking on big tasks that happens. I've definitely gotten impatient with this game's progress at times, but the one factor that gives me the utmost faith in this game, and its developers, is consistency. They push out a stable build about every month or so, and it bring content and mechanics every time. This game is shaping up, and it is starting to look very good.\n\nRight now the story line isn't fleshed out very well, so you've got a little bit of a city builder going. But the thing I find most captivating is that it is some sort of RPG-RTS-City Builder-Simulator hybrid. All of your townsfolk can level up and equip armor and items, making every unit you have unique. Then you have hero units that you recruit as the game goes on. Each one has different abilities (like rogues, healers, warriors, etc). You can give them gear as well. It's just a really cool idea and is improving all the time. There are dungeons to explore, enemies that try to invade, and everything between.\n\nThe game is also visually appealing to me. It's not cutting edge by any means, but the art has that World of Warcraft kind of charm to me.\n\nThe price of this game is pretty steep considering how much content is missing. As it stands you can get about 15 or so hours out of the content before you're stuck trying to find things to do other than min-maxing your units and town. But I recommend it if you see it on sell or you're looking for a game like this to get behind.\n\nIf you're not looking to buy, I at least recommend following the development of this game. When it is done it's going to be very good.","March 11","true","5.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Yes it is in alpha, but as other critics have clearly pointed out, it could have been much greater by now in all senses. My most annoying problem with the game wasn't the bugs, but instead the heavy lacking of interactivity due to the poor camera system and interactive features which were essentially non-existent through my play through. The video made it seem that the villagers would come to life and fill one with a sense of realism in the sense of the town which in turn makes everything more meaningful, but there is very little of that. You barely interact with people, no personal conversations or quests, just stats and names and the randomly generated chat sequences with other NPCs that pop up. My only nice point about this not yet finished game is the art. It is the only immersive thing about the experience of this early access title that is  worth any looking into, but yet, you don't have to buy the game for that! Just go on google images or dwell in the images above!\n\nMy rating is -2/5, 24%, 2/10 and I'd only recommend this game to the developers so they can look over this poor excuse for a game and entitle it a time waster. I'm sure as the development progresses it will be indeed better, but it’s not worth its current charge, simply get it when it’s finished.\n\n(My own opinion and this information is related/valid through my personal play through with the game)","December 19, 2013","false","2.0"," 25 of 45 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","25","45","0","1"

With a great genre combination, and an overall awesome concept- the only aspect that truly disapoints is the execution.\n\nIn its current state, replayability and game functionality are low. The game is quite easy (even on the hardest map) and only takes 2-3 hours to have seen it all. I understand it is in very early development, but the game as remained in an alpha state for years now. The response to it's players complaining of a slow pace was to seemingly split up its patches into smaller patches, all composing of bug fixes.\nI would like to recommend buying this game to support the development team, but it may just be trying to fuel a fire that has no oxygen left.\n\nIf you buy this game, don't get me wrong you will have fun for a few hours, but thats it. You still have a ways to go before playing this game with all it's features and content. I'm obviously no game development expert, but I do not at all feel this game will be finished Early or even Mid 2016 (Make me eat my words please!).","December 30, 2013","false","3.3"," 25 of 45 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","25","45","0","3"

Yes the game is still in development, but it’s to the point now where it’s fun and challenging. The hard maps are hard, frustrating, and extremely addicting to play. The updates are more-or-less pretty regular and new content is being added all the time.\n\nI think what makes this so endearing to me is that the developers really listen to feedback from players and try hard to add suggestions that make sense and increase playability. So much has gone into this game that came in from community suggestions that it’s completely different from when it was orininally launched. When I initially downloaded it, sure it was fun… but after about 2 hours I had seen and done it all. But now that Sandbox is here and stable… I can’t get enough. Great Job guys.\n\nOn a side note; I kinda feel sorry for the new people coming into game at this point. They will have missed the early “Tutorial” game and all the humor it held. But I feel certain it will be back soon, as there are still silly little things tucked away here and there in the game which promise copious amounts of jocularity to come.\n\nI highly suggest that if you join early access, you join the Dev Hang-outs and give feedback.

While the game still has a ways to go, I am confident that Games Foundry will produce a very good product. Why? Because they pump out regular updates, take the time to listen to their players, and use surveys to find out what their investors/players want! They are a very pro-active company and I enjoy the way they are approaching this project.\n\nTheir player-relations are also very good. Multiple times I have asked questions on the forums and have recieved rather swift responses! The game is on the right track, even though it did have a bit of an early turn around from a story-based RPG to a sandbox based RPG, where I can understand some players argument that they are not recieving the game they invested their money into. However, they may provide feedback to help Games Foundry produce the best game possible, because this company does listen. The best indicator of that is the fact that they made such a great turn around.\n\nAnother something that I like is that they have a roadmap on their site, detailing and outlining what they plan on making. It helps regular players like me understand what is to come and increases our faith in the company. So with that said, I will be giving Games Foundry and Folk Tale a big PLUS ONE.

I hope development continues because I really would like to see what it's like as a finished product.\n\nBy "clearing the map" I mean establishing a stable economy, setting up the villages defenses, and then taking a team out to explore the entire map and clear out all enemy camps.\n\nI enjoyed solving the puzzle of stabilizing the economy, but once I found a formula for it I was able to recreate it on every map. The pattern I used on the easy map also worked on the medium and hard maps. The differences were that the resources were less conveniently placed from one map to the next, so the village was more spread out. Also, as maps got harder, enemies would attack from more directions and in larger numbers, so the point where there was a bear den that continually spawned bears right in the middle of my village on the final map. Nothing a dedicated crossbow tower couldn't handle though.\n\nAt the moment, enemies are pretty weak, and only pose a threat to non-combatant villagers. Once soldiers have half-way decent equipment, even the hardest of enemies are pushovers. The defense towers make short work of them as well. They can mess up your town pretty bad if you aren't prepared for their attack though. Hopefully the balance gets worked out here.\n\nWhile very basic at the moment, arming my soldiers, sending them through enemy camps, getting loot, and leveling up is always fun. There are pages on each character profile for (not yet implemented) traits and abilities, which I can't wait to see. Every once in a while an enemy would drop a weapon that is like 5x stronger than any others I could get, which was pretty fun, but further contributed to combat being easy.\n\nThere is another map which shows a different kind of game-play. You start with only 4 peasants and some equipment and have to fight your way out of a crypt. It was pretty easy, but if monster balance and traits/abilities get worked out, I can see that as being another fun game mode. I can see the map editor mode being used to make fun maps similar to this one especially.\n\nI'd say I got my money's worth as is, but am excited to see what it turns in to.\n\n","May 8, 2015","true","16.4"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","18","32","0","0"

Actually it’s a phenomenal game! Some people complain about it being in alpha for a bit too long. Personally Idc, I'd rather they took t heir time to polish it than release it early and have it be incomplete. Before you read all the way through though, Ive only played the game for a few hours, and haven’t beaten any of the maps yet, so this review comes from limited experience and knowledge.\n\nThe Good:\n-It’s fun and challenging, especially after you've progressed past your basic buildings (woodcutter, stonecutter and a food source)\n-Challenging, but not too challenging. ♥♥♥♥ wanders into your town to cause a bit of havoc and stretch your resources. But you don’t have Beholders and Owlbears coming into town to ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up with lasers from their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on a regular basis. They took most of my favorite things from Age of Empires, and combined it with my favorite things from Banished (also a good game, check it out) and then threw in a pinch of Skyrim/Oblivion and Stronghold 2. The result is amazing. You can't just turtle-up and mass an army of foot soldiers to steam roll from one end of the map to the other like you can in AoE. However it’s not as stupidly infuriatingly wonderfully hard as Banished is.\n-It has the added bonus of being actually able to create soldiers (unlike Banished), and gives you enemies that you can go fight and loot. But by no means do you have to. If you like, you can just focus on the drinking of ale, the smoking of pipe weed, and finding a love of gardening.\n-If you do decide to go out and ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up, it’s a challenge. The ♥♥♥♥ you fight keeps, proportionally, 1 step above you. So you have to actually engage in your combat. Most games allow you to step on spiders and kill mice and call it experience. Folk Tale does not.\n-Individuality of the peasants. Now 9 out of 10 times this doesn’t actually matter. The 1/10 of the time it does is in the army. You can, after you've killed something, loot it for gear and treasure! So ♥♥♥♥ing neat, cause with that gear, you can equip Joe the manure shoveling leper, with the Mithril Great sword of ♥♥♥♥off and the Diamond Chest plate of Not In My House ♥♥♥♥♥, and then make Joe the savior of the land, riding valiantly on the monstrous size of his own ♥♥♥♥ which he presumably discovered after finding out he was such a badass and could slay demons with his own ♥♥♥♥ and a can-do attitude. Each peasant can be leveled up uniquely and it’s ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. You can either take the equipment or divide it out between your forces, making a well-rounded security force that is to be reckoned with. Or pour all of your resources into one hulking behemoth that could fight and beat Zeus, god of gods.\n-Visually pleasing to look at\n-Audio is likewise pleasing (kind of reminiscent of LOTR [which is the best series of movies ever made by mankind])\n-There's a great variety of building to be placed and they all do different things.\n-Enemies get more difficult to beat the further you venture from your starting point. ♥♥♥♥ gets crazy yo'.\n\nThe Bad:\nActually I don’t like 'bad' cause really this game is a gem in the making. So we’re going to say the Mediocre.\n\nThe Mediocre:\n-The Elasticity leaves something to be desired\nThis is one big category cause every problem I have comes back to this blanket criticism. What I mean is that       the game doesn’t flow as smoothly as it could have.\n1.	Buildings= There's a variety of buildings, which is good yes, but I feel some of them could be condensed. For instance I had run out of clothes and my villagers began to complain as their nips were starting to fall off from frostbite. Tight. Places Cotton field. Good. Places Tailor. Good, clothes will start to be produced. Wrong. Turns out you also had to place a “Weavers Emporium”. So my warehouse had stockpiled like 50 stocks of weaved cotton, that I then had to go into overtime to catch up on both rewarding and lashing the weavers to get them to work as fast as possible. It just seems to me, that since the only thing you use cotton for is clothes, it seemed kinda silly that you needed 3 ♥♥♥♥ing building to make one product. Placing, monitoring and upkeeping and extra building took away from the flow of the game.\n2.	Your army/security force (4 people isn’t really an army). I have no problem with the small size, in fact I prefer it, it emphasizes tactics over brute strength. I have a slight issue with the equipping of your soldiers. If there was an ‘equip all’ button, that’d be fantastic. Having to click on the guardsmen, open their inventory, open your inventory. Click boots, move boots, click mail, move mail, click gloves, move gloves, click coif, move coif, then do that 3 to 7 more times is more than a lot tedious and it takes away from the game. Like ♥♥♥♥ I got wolves eating Jim the peasant and ♥♥♥♥ing the stonecutters just caught fire I gotta take care of this but noooo first I gotta do this painfully slow process.\n3.	Researching Tech is a pain. It has a AoE feel of spending resource to research new tech, which is legit. Don’t fix what’s not broke right? Well you can go ahead and buy as many upgrades as you can afford at once, the problem is that once one is done, it won’t bounce to the second one. Say you research Chisels, hammers and masonry. Once Chisels is done, it’ll stop there, till you re-click the building, go to the tech tab and select the next tech to research. It leads to a lot of needles bouncing form building to building to check and recheck what tech is at what progress in what building then bouncing back to select the next tech to research even though you’ve already purchased it. Long story, anyway. It would be nice if, once you’ve bought a tech, it got automatically researched in the order they were purchased.\n4.	Assigning peasants a job. This one has two in one. So 1.1 you build a building, tight. Assign 3 peasants to chop wood so you can leave your last one to keep foraging berries. Then later, when you have more peasants you go back to the building, assign a 4th peasant. Jim the farmer dies from a goblin attack, go to building and take 1 woodcutter and unassign him. Go to farm, assign new farmer. Now this doesn’t sound TOO annoying and honestly it’s not. This is my smallest beef with Folk tale. It’s nearly remedied by the ability to check a box on each building titles “auto-assign” which automatically makes sure the building is full of workers if able. You do however, have to go to each building and check the box off. Otherwise no luck. It’s be nice if the box was automatically set to autoassign or you could go to the options menu and make it so. Another (preferred) solution would be to do what “Banished” and have an entire menu that shows all the jobs, how many workers could be there, and how many workers are there currently. It accommodates the fast pace of “Banished” where the east section of your village can just die from a surprise earthquake. I think it would do well here In Folk tale to.\n1.2 This, logically, should be my smallest beef, but it’s not. I like knowing where my peasants are. Like, in Aoe, you have a button to select all inactive peasants, in Stronghold they gather around the fire. In Folk Tale, I’ve got no ♥♥♥♥in’ clue where they are. And that bothers me immensely, as Im more than slightly anal-retentive and I like to specifically assign individuals to certain jobs. When I have to find four free peasants to turn into herbalists by scouring every nook and cranny of my town, its slightly annoying.\n\nAnyway. That’s all. Sorry for the long post but I do really love this game already and wanted to offer every thought I had on the matter. As of now, I give it a solid 8.5/10. With some improvements to the flow and elasticity of the game I’d easily and happily give it a 10/10.\n","May 6, 2015","true","17.3"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","19","34","5","0"

(do make you get the feeling for your town)\n- Well fitting artwork\n- Good animations\n- Good varity of units enemies (more to come maybe going into 10+? creatures, ingame there is 3 factions 2 more too come I belive that is right?)\n- Do need to think where to place building strategic (depends on the map creater if bad design then played bad thats how this game would work, a good map = a good exp!)\n\nCons\n\n- Tutorial outdated (going to be reworked later on)\n- Buildings/res is not balanced or working as it should? (buildings when building it is not right as of yet or timing and res amount is way off for now going to be balanced later on)\n- Battles is not fully there yet (no Heros or many other things that is going into the game)\n\n- Save/load (do not fully work at the moment going to be implemented ofc)\n- Leveling up dosen't work at the moment\n- Stats/ablities isnt ready yet (Coming next update?)\n- Only Tier 1 is in fuction (tier 2 and 3 is somewhat ready but not as of yet)\n- Pathfinding not allways that cind with you..\n\n\n\nNow its more about doing the awsome tutorial a thousend times :P\n\nHavent seen how they are going to make us care about the peasnt and towns folk yet..\nAtleast the devs are advancing this game and looks like they want to complete it with love in their hearts :) Leveling up works but skills after leveling up do not work (like more health to unit or damage and such).\n\nNo workable combat spells or attack abilitys (exept few prev build stuff just added in for fun).\n\nSo there is a long road to actuly get to say if I like the game or not but this far I have loved the game in how they update and were they go with this.\n\nEditor is basic and creating maps by placeing tileset here and there not as advanced like hammer or have the same freedom (scripts, adjustments to a unit/object),and  maybe adding script or changeable numbers like health, damage on obejects like when you want a giant to have more health then a normal enemy (used scale tool on enemy but no change in health and no change in damage).","July 21, 2014","true","382.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

Prior to buying in, I haunted their Steam forum for a few weeks prior, mainly due to the negative reviews on their store page, and the entire time I was impressed by how interactive and helpful the GF devs were on a daily basis.  There was a lot of animosity being leveled at them at the time because they did something virtually unheard of in game development and that was change direction based on the feedback they received from their fanbase prior to being Greenlit.  Whether or not one agrees with their decision, it's an admirable move because so much more often gamers are not listened to and their opinions fall on deaf ears.\n\nSo here we are, a year later and even though Folk Tale is just a couple patches away from 0.3.0 (that's my estimate and I could be wrong), and that's the version the devs themselves caution those who want a playable experience to wait for, I am even more reassured than I was a year ago because I've seen first hand how accomadating and unfailingly interactive the GF devs are on a daily basis and I've been watching the weekly dev hangouts each Sunday since they first started and each week, I'm amazed at what they accomplish from one week to the next.\n\nWithout a doubt, the GF devs are passionate about their game and it shows.  If you have even the slightest misgivings about this early access or just early access in general,  take a peek at the Sunday dev hangouts on twitch and keep tabs on it.  These guys go out of their way to make sure we know exactly what's going on in development.\n\nHow many other early access developers do the same?","July 1, 2014","true","54.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","1"

It's a bit of both Warcraft 3 and Settlers. Warcraft 3 because it contains an RPG element and you build structures to gain resources but Settlers, because there's a little bit micro-management with your buildings and villagers.\n\nI watch the GamesFoundry stream on twitch every Wednesday and through that, I know they are constantly updating the game to become better. They also listen to the community and make changes if necessary.\nWhich was evident from the start when the game wouldn't let you train female villagers into certain working roles, but people complained so they fixed it.\n\nAs of this date: Aug/2015, there is no victory point. Meaning  you will play a map and it will simply never end unless you did badly. However, that'll most likely change soon.\n\nIf you like to craft your own maps and give them out to a community to play, the game got a powerful and simple editor for you to mess around with. Steam workshop will be available for the game soon to facilitate map making and sharing.\n\nFinally, I would like to list some of my pros and cons:\n\nPros\n-Fun game play.\n-Great British humor (Think modern Monty Python).\n-Excellent map editor.\n-Developers heed feedback.\n-Beautiful music score.\n-Heroes and villagers can level up.\n-Love the loot system and that you can give new gear to your heroes and various professions.\n-You can research upgrades for your buildings.\n\nCons:\n-No end goal to a map yet.\n-Voice acting is a bit wonky and can be repetitive and annoying.\n-Sound design and foley is less than adequate.\n-No guard tower unless you build a wall which can ruin your village layout.\n-No story in the game, however, I know it is coming.\n-Professions, like the baker, will get flour and return it to the bakery and it'll automatically generate the bread. You will never see him make the bread which makes me feel like he should just be a carrier instead of a fully dressed baker.\n-While crafting is nice, it is a micro-management that becomes tedious for a large village, as you have to hunt down the house that can craft the item. It would be much better with a crafting tab that contained all the recipes.\n-You cannot set what sort of crop you want to grow until the field is complete. While minor, if you are pulled away from your field before or as it's being built, you might forget to set it to grow cotton and later on wonder why you never get any cloth bolts made.\n","August 6, 2015","true","10.4"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

What they are tackling is very ambitious, and I was worried at first if they could pull it off, but I'm confident they will make it happen.\n\nI get more of a settlers feeling when I play this game, although you can tell they deffinitely want to do more with the game by the time it's done.

The latest builds really make it easy to recommend the game in its current state. If you enjoy city building games like say Banished, you'll probably immediately fall in love with this game as it does more than just the typical city building things. You get to build armies, quest, loot, craft and more. Which is what drew me to the game in the first place. Games Foundry have done a great job thus far with the game, and hopefully their hard work will pay off in the end. :)\n\nhttp://youtu.be/H2mujrOqBd8","March 1, 2015","true","7.3"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

The game has a uniquely quirky vibe to it and isn't afraid to poke a little fun at itself which I find refreshing.  I absolutely adore the art of this game, it reminds me of games like Fable, warcraft or torchlight but has a personality of its own as well. - Dec 2014\n\nUPDATED REVIEW BELOW - May 2015:\n\nDoes this game have longevity potential to provide more than 8-12 hours of village builder gameplay?\n\nCurrently I have over 28 hours played, 24 of those hours have been recent experience. I bought the game when it first hit early access and played the tutorial several times through. This game has come a long long way since then. It still has a ways to go, but the sandbox game has a lot of potential. The management of all the different buildings, villagers, resources, upgrades and trying to keep the villagers warm, fed, happy and healthy all serve to keep you on your toes while you expand your village and explore the surrounding landscape. This is a game that I don't tend to burn myself out on, It's a game that I keep coming back to whenever the GF guys add something new.\n\nWith only 28 hours played you can't really call me a fan boy, that being said, I do enjoy this game and I expect to get another 100 hours or more out of it in the next year or more. It has great potential, it has great art design, great mechanics and a great feel to it. If there was a downside, I would say at the moment it is content. With only three or four maps currently available if you tend to burn through content you might run out quick.\n\n\nWith all that being said, with 24 hours played on the new content I can honestly say that I still have a lot more time to give to this great title and I really look forward to seeing more from Games Foundry.\n\nhttp://www.gamesfoundry.com/gameguide/gettingstarted/\n\nCheck out the gameguide if you are interested in the features currently available.","December 2, 2014","true","40.6"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

I would not spend money on it until more progress is made, because all that is currently available is the longest, most protracted tutorial in history, and not much else. It looks nice, but there's not much substance behind it, unfortunately. $20 is an awful lot for what some people are defending as a "tech demo", one that you'll get the same 57 minutes of enjoyment out of that I did.\n\nEDIT: For the sake of context and continuity, I've left my original review up, but I'm adding an amendment...one that isn't for the better. Sure, they got a whole whopping one level finished in three years. They seem to have fixed most of the bugs, or at least that's what I got in the 0.4 hours I could stand playing the re-engineered game. By game I mean "boredom simulator" because in 40 minutes I was so absolutely exhausted by the the gameplay I couldn't continue. When you feel a sensation of actual physical exhaustion from a game, you know it's not headed in a good direction. Everything you do in the game requires such an annoying amount of micro-management that you don't even know what to do half the time. Requirements for many tasks have no real reason for their existence, other than it was some inexplicable choice on the developer's part to waste your time. The economy/building/research system is infuriating. 40 minutes was all I could stand of this, even the tutorial will kill your interest alone. Stay the hell away from this and buy Banished instead, which is a far superior and much less tedious game.","January 10, 2014","false","1.4"," 22 of 41 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","22","41","2","2"

There's loot and you get to assign it! Also it has a fantastic art style. At the bottom of this review you can find info on the games that inspired Folk Tale.\n\nThe game is dedicated to being a sandbox & having a fleshed-out campaign. All of these facts give it very big boots to fill.\n\nThe Good Lots of genuine potential.\nEverybody here gains exp & levels up! Woo!\nIt's tackling a niche, if you're reading this chances are you feel drawn to something refreshing yet familiar\nAtmosphere is well crafted - both auditory and visually the game is beautiful.\nBuild your town and raise your heroes & soldiers to glory, equipping them for scaling threats.\nVeterans of gaming, the developers have a clear vision but listen to the community\nTools used to make the game are given to players, you get the same resources as the devs\nThe modding community here could explode - parallels between WC3 and FT start to show :)\nCrafting\nRandomly generated items = this is not yet implemented!\n\nThe Bad The game is Early Access, and it aims to be delivered by the end of 2016. And although I personally feel confident in the project, we all know of hiccups that can happen.\nThere are a lot more features destined to be released soon, but it can be disappointing not knowing exactly what the full game will contain. The goods are a plus, the lack of clarity a minus.\nThere's a lot of things on the plate right now, which means features get released but not everything already out is polished, you can really get frustrated at that - for example the UI needs some  updates.\nAt the moment (and I will strive to keep the review up-to-date) there's not many hours of content to enjoy.\nBecause the game has changed direction the updates seem patchy and can really be frustrating at times\n\nThe Verdict\nOverall is it worth INVESTING in? Absolutely!\n\nAs a game however - right now - you have to be willing to have patience. It's not complete and although fun, is brief.\n\n\nHope that helps!\n\n-----------------------------------------Similarities-----------------------------------------\n\nThe following titles I will try to arrange in order of how much inspiration they've served to Games Foundry:\n\nWarCraft III\nBanished\nMore action orientated games (like DotA)","June 20, 2015","true","13.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Like any city building game you build things like farms and butchers and make little production chains to keep your people happy, and watch them in their day to day lives. thats the City building and town sides of it. But what really makes it shine is the way you start to really get attached to your people. Each charecter can be equipped and taken on missions so you start to feel as though you have helped each one grow, and will probably get favourites and the ones you don't like so much and this brings your little town to life.\nThere is also a pretty cool editor which lets you make your own map and therefore your own folk tale story.\nThis is an EDITED review, my last one complained about the Devs never releasing updates nor keeping us informed for a long stretch of time but I have to say this has been sorted to I am now recommending this game!","January 5, 2014","true","2.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However, I am pleased to say that I have changed my mind with the changes that have been made to the game. The development has stepped up a gear and it seems that this is now a viable game. I have only recently re-installed it but what I have seen so far is way better that it was when I wrote my initial review. This is the first time I have changed a review, well done Folk Tale!\n\nedit:\nThe latest patch, as of Feb 1st, has improved things even further. The futuer for Folk Tale is looking extremely good. I won't use the term Settlers 2, oh hang on, I just have.

As it stands, it is not.  The campaign is half baked and poorly implemented, with multiple, long stretches of running back and forth across the same terrain just killing time.  It plays like early ♥♥♥♥♥♥ther quests where you run around, kill things, come back, run back, kill some more, return, rinse, repeat, rinse repeat.\n\nThe sandbox mode is interesting, but also broken and woefully incomplete.  Each resource can be gathered/created in exactly one way, and if that way is not present, too bad.  No animals around to hunt so you can gather hides?  You lose. Want to buy it at the market?  It takes 50 of those non-present resources to build a market. The economy cannot recover from the absence of a single critical component and your time has now been wasted.\n\nI expected the game to be rough and in need of polish.  It is not ready for polishing--it needs some core development, some tuning and THEN some polishing.  This game could be good in about a year.","May 19","false","13.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azurn/recommended/224440/","Azurn","[IVI]Azurn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azurn/","133 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFolk Tale, the Fantasy/SRPG.\n\nNow Ive had this game since literally the first day its been on Steam. The game is by GamesFoundry, a great group of guys who are trying to make this unique game come to life more and more with every update. Although my hours logged arnt that much compared to the others here I have played all through the maps and am currently playing with the map editor, so this gives me a refined base for the game.\n\nLets start shall we?\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are like that of the Overlord game series, but with less doom and gloom. The etxtures are simply wonderful, even close up you can notice small details in the armor of your population, the riffits on the buildings, the notches in the shields and so much more.\n\nWhile the graphics arnt on a serious manner, it gives the game a serious cartoonish feel to it without being on the Borderlands cartoonish side.\n\nI would  give the graphics an 8/10.\n\nAudio:\nThe games audio is beautiful as it has multiple sound tracks and a bit more short bits of music for special events. This makes the game feel alot more adventurous and a bit more mysterious.\n\nAside from the music of the game there is also the ambiance to the game. You can hear the frogs croak in the swamps, the wind howling in the tundras, and the trees swooshing in the grasslands. If you zoom to street level in your town you can hear people talking, music playing in the tavern, bees buzzing in the bee hives ect. It really brings the game to life and I hope they expand on this.\n\nI would give audio a 9/10\n\nGameplay:\nIn the gameplay aspect of this game it gets a bit odd but fun. The basics of the game are like any other, build your base/village, keep your people fed and happy, defend yourself, profit. While its very copy and paste in other games its very unique in this one. During the missions in the game while you build your village up there are creatures which come for your villagers heads during any point in the game. It may be goblins, toadkin, or spiders (The spiders are 1337). If you manager to survive the onslaught to get enough city guards and crossbowmen then youre set pretty much, as long as you use them wisely.\n\nA unique thing the guys at GamesFoundry are working on is a Faction system, much like in World of Warcraft, or ArchAge once you build enough reputation with 1/2 factions on the map they reward you. You may pick a hero from each faction that youre high up in while the other faction tends to hate you more and more, like your ex. But unlike your ex you can actually kill the faction that doesnt like you, or the one you dont like.\n\nAnother cool feature is the items in the game are used on the models in game. An example is the city guard, just a man with a helmet, padded dress armor, and a pike. You can give the guard a bigger pike and the model changes, an axe and it changes, ect. Same with armor, although not all models work for changing pretty much all of them do. Of course there are restrictions such as guards cant use bows and crossbowmen cant use flaming swords, its still a unique feature that focuses on detail and I love it.\n\nGamesFoundry also said they are working on a massive amount of content for the game as well, hopefully sometime in the coming months the content will be finished for the many items they are adding and I can make another eview on more aspects of the game.\n\nI would give gameplay a 9/10\n\n\nIf you guys enjoyed this review I would check the game out! Watch the videos here or on YouTube, read the forums, or if I compelled you enough get the game?  The game is updated very frequently as well, so thats always a plus to have the creators improving their work often.\n\nComments, questions, concerns? There are forums on 'Should you buy Folk Tale?' as well as the 'FAQ' forum for anything you could ask. Hope to see you in the community :)","March 23, 2015","true","46.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

Yeah it may not be complete, but it's running pretty well and there is just so, so, so, so much potential here. I absolutely love this so far. I haven't come across any faults so far in my 3 hours of play, apart from one crash but I completely understand, it's in progress and little blips are a given.\nReally excited to have come across this game and that i'll be able to watch all the new additions as it becomes one of the best games I have played.

In the case of Folk Tale, however, I'm incredibly glad I picked it up. It won't be finished any time soon, so if you're looking for something you can jump in on for cheap, and have a mostly playable game, you'd best look somewhere else. On the other hand, if you want to watch a game as it's being made, if you want a developer who actively engages with the community as it works, and if you want clear goals from an early-access that are visibly being met? This is the game for you.\nI never thought I'd enjoy what amounts to newsletters as much I have, but I actually find myself looking forward to the monthly patch notes and dev blogs. This is what all early access games should be. This isn't another Day Rust Z deal, nor is it an early access game that will never get finished or - worse- finish without making good on its promises. If you're reading this in a year or more, when the game is nearly complete or even completed, I promise you it's worth your money.","August 23, 2014","true","2.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Bah, take as long as you please Devs, this concept deserves as much polish as possible.

My old review was pretty annoyed at the fact that it was sold to me as a campaign based builder, and went sandbox. But that was a long time ago, so I decided to base my current review on what the game is now.\n\nMy main issue now is theyve had *how* long to work on it and the game is still in E.A.? This game was one of the first announced E.A. games, and it was the first E.A. game I bought. That was in....oh....2013, summer I think?\n\nThats a bit ridiculous. E.A. is not supposed to be for building a game from the ground up, as in "Hey, I got this great idea for a game...". Go to Kickstarter for that. This is supposed to be for near functional betas, that need a year or so of tweaking at the most. At least it does appear to be continuously worked on, which is nice.\n\nBut enough of that. For what is there, the game is good if you like sandbox style city builders. Its just glaringly incomplete. Like even the tips on load screens have placeholders because they havent been implemented. And the game hung at least 3 times on load, seems really unoptimized. Theres a decent amount to do, but its hard to get into when theres so much obviously missing\n\nGraphics are excellent, think cartoony "Banished". The UI is very easy to use as well.\n\nThis isnt a negative review so much as a withholding judgement to see what happens, but since Steam doesnt have that option I decided to write this review with a positive.\n\nRight now it has the framework of what could be an awesome sandbox builder. Kind of like when you send your guys to go build something and it slowly rises out of the ground.

In dialogue with the community they shifted the game more toward a sandbox game than completely story driven. The game still features many intrinsic story elements, which at release can be used to introduce the same story driven maps that were in the original tutorial map back in the day.\n\nI honestly like the way this game is going, and are looking forward to future updates.

With one swing of his mighty halberd, Bernard barely scratched the first werewolf he encountered and was killed.  While short lived, Bernard rose from the ranks of nothingness to being a great knight and protector of his people.  Truthfully, he wasn’t so great, but nonetheless, he climbed from being a simple peasant to someone with tremendous potential, even though he never realized it.\n\nMuch like Bernard, Folk Tale is a game with tremendous potential as it moves forward.  Before I continue, I want to remind everyone that this is an early access game.  Numerous features and concepts have not been implemented, bugs can pop-up anywhere, and the game is far from being completed.  It can be frustrating to see an icon that has no function or to open a building detail page only to notice several upgrades are listed, but none function.  If you are not prepared or have no desire and patience for an incomplete game, do not get this game.  Unless you would like to help fund the project, then by all means, purchase this game.\n\nWith that being said, Folk Tale is still an enjoyable experience if a fantasy city builder, with role-playing and questing elements is something that peaks your interest.  As of the current build, gameplay options include a campaign style tutorial, sandbox mode, and game editing.  The tutorial introduces the basics of building, economy and combat.  It is here that the RPG and questing elements are located.  The sandbox mode is what one would expect in that it provides total freedom to build your town without constraints or objectives.  This is the perfect testing ground to further learn the game and explore some of the currently available features Folk Tale has to offer.  And if neither the campaign inspired tutorial nor sandbox mode interests you, fire up the game editor and create your own content.\n\nWhile diverse gameplay modes and editors are great, it’s the core content that drives games into being worthwhile endeavors and consumers of our precious time.  Here is where Folk Tale has set itself up to shine.  From the moment you begin playing the game, the charming, fairy-tale inspired art direction and vibrant color palette catch and hold your attention.  The landscape and buildings come alive through color, detail and lighting (there is even day and night cycles).  The level of detail, whether it be a flower covered rolling hill, a waterfall fed stream with a pedestrian bridge, a newly constructed building or even a simple peasant, is visual treat.  While exploring the land, small, satisfying details are reviled, such enterable buildings that are alive with people and props, which make you want to continue on and see what else is down the road.  The sound is also on par with the great visuals.  The town is alive with the sounds of foot-steps, birds chirping, flowing water, wind and much more.  Once zoomed in close, brief conversations and dialogue from different peasants can be over-heard, much of it quite humorous.  The soundtrack playing in the background also does an excellent job of drawing you into the Folk Tale world with its whimsical melodies.\n\nNice visuals and sounds alone are not enough to push a game into the realm of worthiness.  For that, there must be great gameplay mechanics and features.  With the present build, Folk Tale is just barely achieving that level.  Presently, a variety of buildings can be constructed and the basic economy system is up and running.  For example, you can build a mill and farms to harvest wheat, which in turn is taken to the stock pile to be stored and later collected by the baker so toast can be produced.  This system of intermingling buildings to produce a usable product is well received.  It’s no so overly complicated that excessive micro-managing of every aspect of life is required, but there is enough to keep you busy and engaged.  However, many other buildings and features, such as upgrades and research, have not been implemented in the current build, but the blueprint is there.  This can be frustrating at times, but as I said before, the game is still being developed and being able to see what is down the road is promising.\n\nOne of the most promising and intriguing features are the RPG elements.  Going back to Bernard, I was pleasantly surprised when I selected him and noticed he was a named character.  In looking around the town, I noticed everyone, from the baker to the woodcutter to the barmaid, had a name.  While some where recycled, they each had a name nonetheless.  Beyond that, the foundation for character leveling, special abilities and inventory management was present too.  The farmers leveled up the more the fields were worked, the militia men leveled up after defeating enemies, and so it was for the rest of the working town folks.  Individual character Inventories could be accessed, which allowed for items, such as better armor or weapons, to be provided.  This in turn raised stats such as strength and armor, among other things.  And each different character, depending on their present occupation, had special abilities that could be activated.  For example, the town priest could heal units or pacify enemy units after activating some of his abilities.  Frustrating, many of these features are present, but not implemented into the current game build.  But knowing these will someday be implemented provides tremendous promise and intrigue.\n\nAll in all, Folk Tale is a visually appealing game with massive potential.  It could become one of those rare games which successfully fuses different aspects of some of the most beloved game types into one cohesive unit all while still being unique.  However, time will tell as development is 45% complete at the present time.  Concerning whether or not you should buy this game, I’d say it depends to your level of patience with early access games and your interest level in city building, light PRG, and strategy gaming.  If you can deal with this game being a work-in-progress and have an interest in this style of game, then I’d say it’s a definite purchase.  For being incomplete and sometimes frustrating do to non-implemented features in the current build, I can honestly say I have enjoyed my time and can’t what to explore the finished world of Folk Tale.","August 9, 2014","true","8.4"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","1"

Have they run out of money? A key programmer has left for pastures new? I don't know, but what I do know is nothing much has happened in the year or so since I bought this. I have a horrible feeling my money has been wasted and I should have backed someone else.\n\nThe game itself (what there is of it) is fun for about an hour but once you finish the tutorial there is little else to do, it looks like the recent update has made an attempt at a level designer but this itself looks amateurish and lacks any structure. Maybe one day this game will be finished, if there is then a demo I suggest you download that first before forking out for the 'finished' product.\n\nI really cannot recommend this game in it's current state, hopefully when/if the game is finished then I can update this mini review and wholeheartedly back this game, but judging on this past years performance I fear not.

I've had it sitting in my library for months and months and all that's availible is the tutorial. Wait until it's more developed before revisiting it.\n\nMar 23/14 - Decided to pop in to see what's new. Game now boots to a title screen with a few new options to edit landscapes and characters, but under the Play option, all that's availible still is the tutorial. Might be fun to play with the landscape editor if you're into game design, but for players it still hasn't advanced beyond the tutorial.\n\nMay 5/14 - Still only tutorial availible in the play mode.\n\nMay 28t/14 - New update published for the game. There is now a customizer for users to fiddle with the intricate details on character models (not sure how noticable customized nose length will be in such an overhead style of play). There is also a Sandbox mode added. This sandbox mode is not fully developed and is still in infancy stages. Users can construct buildings (they will not use up resources to do so) but will be unable to use them. More just a quick simulator of how you might layout a town when/if it becomes fully developed. Many buttons have not been activated yet, including map controls.\n\nJune 5/15 - This game has taken a long time to move into a playable state. However, I did some playing last night, and while some functions are not yet activated, the game is very much usable.

FolkTale has become improved greatly. I haven't played it for too long so I still don't have the best experience but I will say that this game has improved massively since launch. You can now build your own world (Which I have no clue how to do but the option is there) and your own character which isnt exactly at the level of Skyrims but then again this game doesnt have the funding of Skyrim. The story isnt exactly a masterpiece but it is passible. This game has a large choice of things to do and by large I mean MASSIVE. Since my first review the game has earned the title of Village Builder RPG and it is a more enjoyable game to play. Even if you aren't going to buy as of this point of time I would keep an eye on the developer and Folk Tale as I have seen massive improvments to the game unmatched by most others. This game doesnt get anywhere near the amount of attention it deserves. Though it isn't perfect it sure isn't a bad game I am can promise you it will continue to improve judging by the features already added. One last thing you need a BUFF PC to be able to play this at 60fps despite its cartoonish look. Overall I rate Folk Tale 8/10 for its ever improving gameplay.","June 17, 2014","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Dev blogs come out fairly swiftly, but what is actually being done? Not a lot. Come back in a year and check it's progress. I am thoroughly sorry I paid you guys any money at this point. I completely understand Early Access but nowhere did it say "please buy our game and sit with no content to enjoy for years" So in my opinion thats a crock. Do some actual programming and coding work, get this thing done. Anyone worth their salt would have had a playable product by now.\n\nEdit: State of Game June 2015. Game looks a lot more like a game now. Much of what was originally promised in the videos is not implemented yet and for how long it took to get free building, proper character action, and 1 hero...we probably wont see the rest of it for quite some time.\nThat said, Folk Tale is an awful lot more enjoyable now than it was a year ago. There are actual RPG elements coming into play now. I personally feel like Folk Tale is trying to make too many people happy. The focus is too broad. I certainly hope Games Foundry can deliver, but it's a tall order. You guys want to create a RTS, city builder/management, with RPG elements. This is really hard to do and the time to implement all of this might be enormous.\nMy suggestion for the time being is if you enjoy following a project in development go ahead and get this. You'll be following it for a while yet. If you are not patient and expect what you see in the marketing videos to be playable in game, you will be disappointed.","July 29, 2014","true","22.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

I keep seeing where they've done updates and I've checked it out fairly regularly.  The game just doesn't seem to be going anywhere.  There are a lot of aspects to this game that would make it a good game, however it seems like the devs have any real interest in working on them.  In the past year about the only thing they've really added was a save feature.  Just stay away from this mess.  I have a feeling this game will never get out of early access.\n\nAfter playing this game again I have decided to change my review to possitive.  A lot has been fixed in the game, and it's made an astonishing turn around.

It's a city-builder RPG that plays like an RTS. It's Folk Tale.\n\nFor a company with only 9 developers, only one of them being a programmer, this is amazing.

They are focusing on gameplay now, and they are adding several gameplay enhancements and mechanics.\n\nThe game still has a long way to from the time of writing this, january 2015, but I believe that they will get there and this will become an awesome game.\n\nBe sure to be watching the developer streams on wednesday (previously on sunday), to pick up the latest development progress and ask questions to the developers.\n\nEdit: To anyone wondering if you can save in sandbox, the answer is YES, via console.

After some long months away from Folk Tale I can only say I was pleasantly surprised with how much the game has changed for the better.\n\nEverything I said in my old review of the game (posted below) was improved. Now there's a pretty solid sandbox mode with a lot of different buildings available, a working save/load game, and overall a great game that will consume some hours of fun playing.\n\nAlthough still in development, now it really gives me something to look for in the future. Made me a believer again. Here's hoping to a continually good development.\n\n\n(OLD REVIEW) The game itself has a great potential. The only problem is the rate of development. It's really, REALLY slow. Like I-bought-this-game-a-year-ago-and-too-little-was-added slow. So far it's only available a tutorial (that shows a lot of the upcoming final game, with some great gameplay mechanics), a really incomplete sandbox mode, with a lot of things not yet implemented (you can't even save/load) and nothing more.\nSure, it's early access, but compared to other dev teams that usually send out various updates with a lot of content, it's quite bad.

I recently gave it another go, based off of the devs suggestion that it has in fact changed and there was a lot more content. So far, I'm having a lot of fun with it.

Reminds me of warcraft 3 - my favorite game.\n\nIssue #1 ... I have to buy shirts from market because I can't build the necessary buildings. Took me a 2 games to figure this out because everyone eventually left the village which is frustrating.\n\nIssue #2 ... The campaign got stuck when I went to talk to Nara. It created a permanant Willow character stuck at the throne room and an additional one that became playable.  I could get the antidote for the quest but when I returned nothing happened and the stuck Willow was still there with "talk to Nara and return to Nara" both remained unable to be checked off.\n\nIssue #4 ... If a non hero character dies any inventory dies with them.\n\nIssue #5 ... Many of the buildings and upgrades are not supported yet which makes balancing economy and defence semi difficult.\n\nIssue #6 ... If you craft weapons at the blacksmith for a proffession (in my case woodcutter) you are unable to unstack them. - I created 8 axes for 2 different camps (4 woodcutters each) and was forced to drop all 8 in the camp inventory. Additionally once an item is placed in a building inventory - it is unable to be removed while in use even if only 1 item on a multiple item stack is being used.\n\nIssue #7 ... The carrots harvest value is too low.  I had 6 fields of carrots with 50 population and couldn't keep carrots in inventory.\n\nIssue #8 ... Berries stop being able to be harvested as soon as you build any other type of food harvest building.\n\nIssue #9 ... I wiped out the camp of Tauren type creatures but they would randomly spawn an attack - either have them respawn in the camp so you can guage when an attack will come or eiliminate them once they are gone.\n\nIssue #10 ... Better defined use of gems, rings, charms etc... I can equip them but there is no indication of what they do. Same for many lootable items... spider webs etc .\n\nIssue #11 ... I chose to leave the goblin in the cage in Kenny's hideout but then it was permanantly there... possibly an option to come back and release him later.\n\nAll in all a good game and I understand it's still somewhat in development.

Unlike some games that are alike this function to some degree as a realistic village. You can't just spam units because you can only support the population of your town which makes it far more realistic than some other RTS games. The game is just really limited. The campaign is alot of running between two places to talk to someone, but the gameplay overall provides enough to keep you busy. In addition, the sandbox mode needs some work. It includes the same people as the campaign but no one is good or bad, you have to kill everything on the map for some reason, no one is your ally. And sandbox is very limiting because after you annihilate your opposition with your one soldier, there's nothing else to do. No one attacks or anything.

Of course it still has some way to go. My comments as of patch 0.3.3:\n- The issue with the game not loading has been partially fixed; you get a pop-up allowing you to choose running the game with the older directX, thus enabling the game to load.\n- The extra enemies roaming the world is really great (I am talking about the bears, wolves and so on). They present a nice challenge while you try to expand your city and helps level up your heroes and/or military units.\n- A better system for equipping units is needed. It might be okay finding 10 different units to equip each and everyone, but when you get just a bit above that it becomes a nightmare, really. An auto-equipping tool or a better system for finding and selecting individual units perhaps.\nIn the swamp map new units keep joining your city even though you haven't build cottages to support them. While a few of these joinings can work, it needs some limit as it becomes really hard to keep up with all the new units.\n- The storage system is still unlogical. There seems to be no shared limit for each resource and the storage house is missing update functions that allow for more storage.\n- The city wall is missing a function that allows for upgrading from tier 1 to tier 3.\n- I would really like some sort of road tool, so you can make the city look more city-like.","October 31, 2015","true","32.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

This is something to keep in mind.\nSecondly, it's updated infrequently, but the devs keep people up to date on what they're doing.\n\nThat said, it's honestly shaping up to be a pretty good game (in my opinion). As a city builder it's ok, maybe not the greatest thing on the planet, but it's capable. Where it really shines is the editor. The editing tool is a fairly robust mapping tool, that I love.\n\nLastly, I haven't put to much time into the game, so you should probably disregard my review, and read those of people who have played for a longer length of time.

This time, not because anybody asked, but because I felt the game deserved one for shot. So, here I go.\n\nThe game is fun, it will hold your attention, and it has DEFINENTLY improved over time. This is, after all, early access. But of course, it has its flaws. I thought this game to be a waste at first, of money and time. But, maybe I was just tough on it.\n\nI found the game to be easy, but then again, maybe I'm just good. Folk Tale had a certain charm to it. But, this didnt mean it was perfect. I had trouble with alot of the controls, and the tutorial helped a little, but I was still confused. Now, after playing a while longer, I created my game. I had fun, for awhile atleast. Handled the placement bugs, the bears, yada yada yada. But, eventually, sooner than expected, I hit the point where the game is complete. I've done everything, only too easy. At this point, I stopped and, said "Ok, that was fun for awhile". Deciding that I didnt wish to continue playing. Maybe I just dont like the game, not my cup of tea.\n\nI would recommend to get this game, on sale, or to get it and, make sure you decide wether you like it or not before you've gone past the TIME OF NO RETURN (2 hours). But if you like Town building, or are able to just connect with your characters, I think you'll like it.\n\nIf I could tell the dev team anything, I'd tell them to continue working hard. To keep adding and, adding. A few bug fixes, and some updates, and this game will certainly be great.\n\nSincerly,\nMastersimoligy","August 8, 2015","true","7.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","7"

Plague","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nystel/","183 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI wrote a review for this game back on April 2 and at the time I did not recommend this game.  It was not due b/c of poor content or lack of updates, but I felt the game had not been developed enough.  To me, it seemed that Folk Tale was missing some basic features.  Now that I am playing it again a month later; I want to update this review.\n\nIn the April review I listed a few concerns/issues that I had.  There were:\n1) Lack of right clicking the screen to move the map.\n2) Main resources not on the main screen.  I would have to go into menu system to view this important information.\n3) Easily calling soldiers to the fight.\n\nHere is my update, plus a few things for a wish list.\n\n1)  Even though the devs never put in a right click and hold feature to move the map quickly like in most RTS games, they did implement a "shift" function.  You still move the map with WASD keys normally.  To traverse the map more quickly, you still use the WASD keys but also hold shift.  At 1st I didn't know if I would like this, but I will say that this works pretty well.\n\nI have been told in the next few patches they are going to refine this feature further to give the player more control.  (Will be able to adjust speed of the camera, etc.)\n\n2) They fixed this.  The important rescores (wood, stone, iron, food) are all on the main screen, plus more.\n\n3) This one is kind of sort of on me.  The game has yet to have a patrol function or a QRF button (quick reaction force, military term)  but you can group your soldiers to a number key and call them into battle that way.  One thing I did notice in my earlier review; you could only have 4 soldiers at a time.  At the time the game did not have an upgrade feature for the barracks.  As of now, it does and you can recruit more soldiers through upgrading the barracks.\n\nThe devs have really been listening to the community and this is a huge plus!  In fact, after I wrote my 1st review, I was contacted by them and they talked to me about my concerns.  Amazing!! For that and all the said updates, I am now "recommending" this game!  However, do realize that it is still in early access and it has been for a while and probably will stay that way till roughly early 2016 (per game page on steam).  Do not think that this is finished project.  It is not, and the devs would agree.  However, it is still a fun game.  Visually and audibly, the game has really set the bar in this type of genera.   I look forward to future updates and Dev Hangouts on Twitch.\n\nWish List:\n\nI will update as more ideas and thoughts come to me.\n\nRoads:  It would cool to be able to build roads in the game.  It seems like on the map there are lanterns and wall around that look like they should be on a road.  Or as you build buildings close to each other, maybe a road will automatically appear.\n\nPeasants:  I am not sure if there is quicker way or not.  But having a feature where you can quickly find peasants.  I always seem to have to look around my town to locate them, when I want to manually task them.","April 2, 2015","true","5.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","5"

That being said, I am happy with the direction it has gone in, and even though it is currently incomplete, it's still a pretty fun game.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my time playing the campaign and sandbox modes, so I haven't given the map editor a whirl yet. This game's primary focus is on village building, but all your villagers can be equipped with gear and called upon to fight, and everybody levels up. You can create soldiers and arbalists as your primary fighting force, and there are unique characters with special powers, abilities and gear. While there are plenty of enemies on the maps to make conquering it challenging, they do leave you alone for a short while so you can establish your defenses enough.\n\nThe level of involvement is great and I can't wait to see what else they add to the game.

That being said, I am happy with the direction it has gone in, and even though it is currently incomplete, it's still a pretty fun game.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my time playing the campaign and sandbox modes, so I haven't given the map editor a whirl yet. This game's primary focus is on village building, but all your villagers can be equipped with gear and called upon to fight, and everybody levels up. You can create soldiers and arbalists as your primary fighting force, and there are unique characters with special powers, abilities and gear. While there are plenty of enemies on the maps to make conquering it challenging, they do leave you alone for a short while so you can establish your defenses enough.\n\nThe level of involvement is great and I can't wait to see what else they add to the game.

Looking at my hours played, this should be no surprise. Although it does not directly support modding, creators can make whatever they want of the game, be it modifying the city building, or simply create a standard RPG with factions, dungeons, boss fights and loot - completely skipping the city building aspect of it. Endless hours of fun definitely awaits.\n\nHowever, if you are just a player, content will be rather limited. Seeing as the entire campaign is going to be made in the editor they are giving to players. Then obviously the content has taken a hit and only 8-10% of the campaign is done (still some good hours though). You can randomize your own maps, pop in a couple of enemies and have fun fighting with them, but for a tailor made experience, you might want to wait a couple more months, wait for the campaign to be nearer completion or the integration and implementation of steam workshop.\n\nHowever, as it has developed, I am quite confident that it will live up to whatever expectations you might have to a game of this genre. if you are or have a little map maker inside of you, or maybe you want to tell a funny story, buy ASAP and start creating. If you are a player looking for a finished product, either wait for completion or grab the game when it pops up on sale.","December 28, 2015","true","518.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","3"

You have your peasants as your basic unit which you then promote or demote as needed to keep your city going. They can focus on gathering resources, resource processing, and combat. As it stands now the project has basic gameplay available - no resource processing yet but the buildings and roles are there just no logic behind them.\n\n/workhat on\nAs an IT scrummaster, for a team this size working 2 years on this game it looks great. Some may complain about the lack of content up to this point but you need remember that first they need to build the world and they made some changes based on community feedback which causes rework of many of the upstream tasks, thus changing their plan. The more that support their development by purchasing the Early Access to allow them to increase team size, even with the time needed to onboard the new people it would increase their velocity.  They want their game released as bad as the rest of us but I'd rather them take a page from Blizzard's book and release it when it's done that EA that patches it when it's released.

Now keeping that said in mind I can honestly say that this game reminds me of AOE, Pharo, Roma, Cesar & Others of that nature. I have always injoyed my Stratagy Games and RPG most of all and this game Is absolutly FUn and Injoyable to me because it follows them very close.\nNow that said, this game does need a lot of tweeking to become something GREAT and yes It will take YEARS to become just that.\nThe DEV team work there Buts off to get this game to us and in hopes to be be proud to say they made a game that is worth buying and playing as well, lets face it WE WHANT TO PLAY GAMES!\nSo From me to the DEVS please keep working hard and DON'T Give Up or Give in to little Pills that need to feed on negative crap! We all know you guys work very hard and try your best to give us what we all disire.\nJust one note, Fix Bugs before placing in new content as that is a Major Problem for many games out there today in there Completed state!\nAs for all you gamers out there, Ither pay a small fee and I do mean small as in $25 or less is small. $60 or more for a new Xbox, playstation games are just nuts and they show us Crap most often than not, hell we all know that I and you have payed big on some games expecting this MOST OSOME game and turn out to be nothing more than GALMMER CRAP!\nWe have become graphic spoiled and whant our $ worth. I know this because as I said I have been gamming for over 30+ years. So  when I say a Gamne is good take my advice and FOLLOW Your GAM|ING GUT and reserch the game before you buy it!, not follow some no name internet players advice! Judge a game based on what you like and how you like it but remember as Gamers we ask a lot but see nothing of the hard work put into it!\nDEVS keep chin up and GROW SOME Balls and tell players what you are willing to do and what you are not. A Great Story line in a Game Always sells and Never Disapoints. Stick to your GUNS and gammers will SUPORT YOU!\nGamers Pull the Suther out of your ♥♥♥ and GIVE DEVS some Damm respect And learn to Make up your own damm Mind, DO some fliping reserch before you buy anything!\nCheers all!","May 6, 2015","true","27.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

They keep to their promises and the updates have been great. It is addictively fun even in its current state. This is one of those games I'm not just "gambling" on as an early access purchase. I'm proud to help support it.","March 25, 2015","true","17.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

So far, after the early may 2015 patch, I think it shows quite a bit of promise.  It's been stable, the graphics are plenty good for the type of game, and at this point, there's a reasonable diversity of buildings.\n\nThere's several things that should be added (or, if they exist, pointed out where they are):\n- there needs to be a list of villagers so you can easily see how many of each kind there are, select individuals, etc.\n- soldiers don't seem to have a patrol ability.

When I saw the upgrades in each building I was excited to think of all the different enhancements the villagers would get but unfortunately , most are just a 10% increase in efficeincy . Nothing wrong with that but , even a little variety in the upgrades would be a bit more interesting . Maybe the hunters could get increased range , butchers could get stronger with a bit more damage , same with woodcutters .... I geuss what im trying to say is when panning over the upgrades a building offers only to see 10% efficeincy on ALL of them in the upgrade window ...meh ... variety is the key ...\n\ngreat game . i love it . i dont mind the slow pace at all . It can take a bit to figure out how many villagers are prone and not working ... because at first I wanted to see a ratio of villagers with no assignments and then quick key to them but it's actually not that bad whatsoever .\n\nkeep up the bug fixes .

I noticed it ages ago, so when it went on sale a few days ago, I took the plunge despite the mixed reviews. I'm glad I did. I can see Folk Tale becoming one of my all-time favorites.\n\nI've played city builders since early Caesar, and plenty of RPGs. The art is cute and really crisp. I love the look of my village, and the various looks of the upgraded buildings (only gotten to level 2 so far, though). I feel like I've barely scratched the surface, and am looking forward to getting into the RPG aspects more.\n\nI know it's not finished, but I have my own list of things I would love to see improved sooner rather than later:\n\n-- Labor management needs fine-tuning. There needs to be an easy way to list all the villagers, and see who is working where, so you can spread out the workforce the way you want it when there's a population downturn. Plus, It's virtually impossible to find your peasant. Yes, you can click on any building an see him or her on the left, as the lone unemployed person, but the Find button doesn't work for this person. Also, who is living in which houses? (Less critical, but could be fun.)\n\n-- The odd language choices confuse me. Yes, "on nom nom" is a cutesy way of saying "eat", but it looks like gibberish on the screen. Worse is "very work, much happy" which appears under every character's mini portrait in the building menu. Very weird -- it made me think the game was being made by non-English speakers, but the studio is based in London. King's English, people! Another suggestion: lose the "some" in the activity status -- because "retrieving some bolt of cotton" is grammatically incorrect and bugs.\n\n-- The buttons around an individual's portrait are confusing. What is the brain-like thing that has a dotted green line around it? I didn't see it mentioned in the Tutorial. Add the job title to these mini portraits -- they now appear only if you click on an individual's inventory. That's really tedious. I want to click on a person and see their job title immediately.\n\n-- It would be nice to be able to cycle through your citizens so you could quickly put extra armor and whatnot on them. Also, I'm tired of seeing the same guy's face, even for the women. He's not even cute.\n\n-- When a villager is sick, a green cloud appears around him or her, but there's nothing in their personal information that says they're infected (or what with, which would be a nice detail).\n\n-- Any chance of a time fast forward? That green expansion bar moves really slowly, even after you've corrected an error. It takes a long time for the changes to take effect. This is normal for city-building games, but most of those have pauses and fast fowards.\n\n-- I can't figure out a good way to use my troops. There's no real patrol function, since they don't respond to attacks unless you tell them to. I tried posting them on the borders -- that helped some, but they still seem pretty ineffective. Also, it's not clear (to me yet) how you can have both melee and rangers in the same barracks. Seems to be an either/or? I admit I haven't fully researched this -- I hope a future Tutorial will delve into town defense.\n\n-- I found some villagers doing tasks unrelated to their jobs? (Like harvesting carrots when they're a fisherman.) Is this intended?\n\n-- The resources totals at the top don't seem to go past 1000 -- even the town gold. I know I had more than 1000 coins, I just collected more taxes, but the number never changed. I'm not sure if I got credit for the money or not. I assume it's a bug and not a real cap. For another resource, iron bars, the inventory pane showed more than 1000, but the top bar didn't.\n\n-- After playing for awhile, and using the inventory, items show up as white boxes.\n\n-- What does the woodcutter do once all the trees are cut down? Supposedly I got some tree seeds, but I have no idea how to use them.\n\n-- I wish there were scenarios, ones that gradually increase in difficulty, like in Tropico or Caesar IV. And more building options (as in variety of buildings).\n\nI'm very excited by all the possibilities with this game. I hope it all comes to pass -- the city-building genre needs some great new titles.","May 9, 2015","true","5.1"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I know this is going to be an excellent game when it is done. It had gone from a test of the game engine basically up to the status it is now which is much more immersive. Fans of city builders and rpg adventure would do well to buy this game and join in influencing how you want to see the game develop. You can even create your own maps. When this game is completed you are going to be kicking yourself and wondering why you didn't get it for that cheaper price earlier on. Sure plenty of people have been burned with games that were early access and never saw completion, however, this Dev team is dedicated to what they are doing and come out with regular updates and fixes to the existing game.

I think as it stands it is a fun game and I like the direction that it is going.

Unfortunately, it is still very far from obtaining the gem they wish to create, and could possibly take too long. From what I've gathered, the focus of the game is currently being shifted toward a less scripted sandbox mechanic as proposed by overwhelming popular majority(I think). Also, the amount of features required to give this game any replayability is quite daunting for a team of this size, and as a result they will be facing a very long roadmap. In any case, I always have support for dedicated developers, and I hope they will continue to hold costumer feedback in the highest regards. For these reasons I have personally invested in their vision, and will be an active contributor if development continues. I would expect others to understand that you will not be paying for a very long period of play, but it could possibly become an engaging and extensive game in a couple painstaking years. If you don't want to throw money at the situation like i have, then at least keep an eye on it for a sale of some kind, or an update that really seals this economy pinch they're in.\n-Thanks for reading!","November 17, 2014","true","10.8"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

I will update when I put more time in, but so far I enjoy the game. Lets keep in mind I bought it even though there are mixed reviews. It is an early access game that has been early access for a long time, but so are many other games I currently play. To me that isn't a deal breaker so long as there have been updates made.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nIt reminds me of Banished, but adds another layer to your townspeople that was lacking. I like that I can research new armor to equip onto each person and learn new ways to make my farming or mining more successful. It feels like I have many more options to customize my town how I want. Plus there is even combat and looting!\n\nI was confused at first how I was supposed to find anyone in my town when I needed lets say my Hunter. Reading reviews this was a major concern to others as well. After a little while I did figure out a simple way in locating anyone that is assigned to a building. Just go to that building and it will list your workers with a little button that selects them. Not the easiest way ever. This isn't something pointed out to you in the tutorial either, so I am guessing there is plenty more that I will have to discover for myself.\n\nEven still I like the look of the game and the music as well. The voices used are pretty solid, but don't vary a ton.\n\nI am looking forward to future updates and playing the game more myself to get a better feel for it!","May 6, 2015","true","1.2"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

Also I might add that ALL the comments about the game not changing much is Rubbish. This game is the perfect example, like Star Citizen, of developers consitantly listening and iterating to the community and leveraging new funds to expand the game to something much greater than it was. They have just gotten to the tail end of actually developing the engine technology and will be building the RPG content and story. I highly recomend this game for I support their vission, which they have done nothing but prove they are consistantly achieving and moving towards through frequent updates.

It can be compared to banished BUT IT IS DIFFERENT\n**I cannot stop playing**\nBanished is a very difficult and tedious game... but this is completely different because of a few things.\n- You control the population\n- Resource collecting in general is less of a chore and more of a joy\n- Crafting\n- Loot from enemies\n- Fighting, which I'll get into here\n- Enemies spawn in groups across the map. There are even enemy strongholds\n- You build barracks to make soldiers\n- Anyone can fight but they ^ are the best\n- There are bears, wolverine-like clawed monsters, spiders and their nests, enemies weilding axes, etc.\n- Research can be performed increasing the efficiency and benefits of all the buildings (they are all different)\n- Huge impressive defensive walls can be built\n- You can make a gate anywhere in the wall\n- You can mount crossbows on the wall towers to fend off invaders\n-----------It's early access... there's so much more coming!\nThe few cons (I'm not listing things that are not implemented like potion ingredients because it will become irrelevant eventually)\n- Disease spreads like wildfire, and while it's not devestating at all if you manage it, the narrator announces whenever someone becomes sick which is often\n- Some may say the spiders come too frequently, but if you take out the nest they will stop coming. They sort of patrol around it. (A fun feature for me but maybe annoying to some who don't want to fight)\n- I can't think of any other cons\n\nThis is just a beautiful, original (as far as I can tell) and addicting game. The balance is unmatched by anything else out there right now with the addition of rpg fighting mechanics and strategic placements of guards and walls.\nMy advice: Get it now.","May 11, 2015","true","5.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I initially purchased it right out of the gates and only dabbled in it.  I was happy to take part in the early access concept because this style of game play appeals to me.  Now I am extremely happy to have finally returned to the title to take a peek at all that's happened since those early first steps.  Very excited about how the new sandbox play operates and extremely encouraged by what I've seen so far.  I know find myself wondering...how much longer? HOW MUCH LONGER for the next patch lol!\n\nThe simple way to look at this game is, if you enjoy city builders, if you enjoyed the Settlers and the Anno series, then this is the style of game that is right up your alley...AND add to that some more in depth RPG elements.

Spaced appart and marked clearly"\n\nSo I was responding a to  a4440a's review and steam said my post was to long, what I was going to post:\n\n"I have no issue that they askedd for positive feedback. They even said in the request that if you feel that the game does deserve the negative feedback it's been getting that it's on them. But requesting the people who do enjoy it to have their voices heard is not wrong. People are WAY more likely to post things when they feel negatively about something than when they feel positive. As a person who works in retail we ask for customer feedback to know how we did andd to see that we made a persons experience enjoyable. So few people actually give positive feedback for anything and there post looks no different then when a clerk asks for feedback about the service. And more than 98% of people don't give feeddback if not asked. I know this because 2% is our goal and we rarely hit it with asking.\n\nAlso the Dev's seem to be pretty good at responding to every review. So the dev team is clearly still active. Even coming back to this review after they had responded when a new patch came out. That's fantastic service. "\n\nIt should be noted one of his/her main issues was that they had asked for the fans and people who were enjoying the game to give feedback. They didn't force anyone to. They merely, and quite frankly very politely, asked people to give feedback. Yet he/she, like many others, made it seems like a horrible thing that they had done. like they had enroached on their freedoms and it was unethical and immoral. infact a few posts stated it was immoral. . . SERIOUSLY????\n\nAnd it made me realise ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is that people have been treating this game and dev's like dirt. This game is someone's and like a group of someone's dream. They may not get patches out as fast as some other dev's but they also haven't abbandoned it like SO many early access games before them. I've been watching this game and sure it's taking a while but they are working on it. It is looking good slowly but surely. They're working hard a doing a damn fine job. If you really don't think so then why not try writing some lines of code to fix the issues you are having with the game yourself and submit it to then, and wait to see what conflicts it causes in the code. Then A) you could see just how long it takes to actually write the code and B) how it almost always creates more errors that will need fixing. And hey if you do a great job maybe they could use you or you could make your own game, who knows. You don't that's for sure, not till you try.\n\nto wrap up keep it up guys/gals ignore the haters and the nay sayers. The doom talkers and the ones who act holier than thou. They aren't making a game they aren't dealing with crap you are and they are just being plain old rude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs promised (key dramatic drum beat) BUM BUM BUM (Thank you band, I'd be lost without you)\n\nREVIEW TIME!!!!!!!!\n\n\nSo been watching this game for a while, and as horrible as this may sound at first I ask you to hear it out, I even pirated this game when it had that short story with the monastery/temple thing in the snow with if memory serves were-wolves? I don't really condone piracy flat out but clearly not against it. It's a grey area for me. I believe in supportive piracy. Demo's don't really exist any more and the few that do are tailored to be as appeasing as possible which sometimes ends up being NOTHING like the game in question. So I coined the term supportive piracy, in which is you like what it was you pirated you go out of your way to support them by buying the program, movie or whatever and or donating too them the amount. Because if you support them they will make more of the things you like, and not go bankrupt. Rules for supportive piracy is if you find yourself playing it for the full story line and enjoying it. . . SUPORT IT\n\nFind your self playing it for more than 5 hours?. . . SUPPORT IT\n\nWhen back to play more after the first week you DL'd it. . . SUPPORT IT\n\nAny one of those equalls a support even if say you only played for an hour the first week then a week and a half (or longer) later you go back and play again. Yea that counts.\n\nSorry rant. . .\n\nAs I was saying I had pirated the game. It was lacking in content, and was over fairly shortly. But it had promise, still does.\n\nso I followed it on steam and added it to my wish list so I'd know if it went on sale. It did and my buddy gifted it to me, before I was ready to buy it and after I asked for a diff game.\n\nBut I decided to try it out again it had been a while, a LOT had changed graphics are way better and the interaction with your citizens is really cool. the voice acting is fun and enjoyable and has that classic british. . . smart ace to it. Is there more to be done? Sure but it's coming along very nicely and i'm excited to see what they do. It's also going a diff way then I originally hoped it would but that's not surprising I have yet to find the game style I have envisioned in my noggin.\n\nAs someone else had said it's a bit like banished but simpler. And not just in difficulty but also in concept. However also has different features, that being the exploring RPG elements that make the simpler city building aspect fit. I don't think the hard ships and deep intricacies that banished has would work well while you're out leading your troops in battle.\n\nAll in all I'd say the game is very enjoyable\n\n\n\nFor those wondering about the game concept in my noggin\n\nI guess the closest thing it would be is a castle/city builder. But builder is wrong word. . . more like upgrader. You take on the role of the person/thing/higher power? in charge. You don't control the movements of anyone (like in banished). You control what get's upgraded where funds go, perhaps the blacksmith which allows him to upgrade his furnace, or higher on additional help. Funds into captain of the guard so he can reinforce the walls with more guards or the barracks for having an army. You can also decide if certain upgrades need to be researched or if an attack is coming to call the citizens in behind the walls. As time goes on and the city grows outer walls would be made, your army goes out and secures roads from bandits. if you declare war your generals and armies attack but how and when they choose. your only concern is uprgrading the castle, city and such.","May 6, 2015","true","2.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

At a glance, it looked fun, thought I might play for an hour or so then call it quits, like with most early release games I buy.  They provide a nice distraction, but I rarely get hooked.\n\nFolk Tale, however, did not disappoint.  I'm still playing it, and can't seem to get enough.  Even at this early stage.\n\nIt should be noted that my girlfriend and myself, who are both playing it, are huge fans of the Fable series by Lionhead (except for Legends...whats that even about?!).  We love the setting, the characters, the humor, the art, all of it.  So Folk Tale is a natural fit for us.  Its a beautiful fantasy setting where everything has tons of character.  The buildings are unique and stand out amoung the beautifully rendered landscapes.  The people who live in your town are fun to watch as they go about their day doing their thing, whatever that is that you assign them to.  The interface is intuitive, but offers a ton of complexity if you want to get down and dirty.  Once I found that I could even start assigning clothes and armor to my townfolk I was completely enamored.  I imagine you could just play from a 50,000-foot level and just manage a-la 'god sim' or get down and really micromanage each and every one of your townfolk.\n\nPersonally, I love a good sim where I can make my townfolk happy and prosperous, and the idea that I can send them off on quests and watch as my world becomes a kingdom...well...I'm hooked.  It's fun, easy to learn, but complicated and with enormous depth, and they still have a ways to go, which to me means it's only going to become more and more awesome!  I love where it's going, and can't wait to see what's next.","May 11, 2015","true","9.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

This is not just a game but a game within game creation software!!! It is almost unfair to call it a game. I swore to myself after so many abandon ware or early access quiters or whatever kind of crap game rip off that comes along i was not going to "buy" another game. Most of the bad reviews mainly discuss the 2 years in early access. Yes i agree that 2 years is a little long for early access but... the producer is small and METICULOUS so deserves a little slack. o.k. i did not buy this game 2 years ago so maybe my frustration level is not as high as someone who did; but all you have to do is mess around with this "system/game/what have you" and you will see the potential this title has. I look at it like this; if you have a game that allows modding or level development you have a virtual unlimited game. Add to this that mod levels are often better than the developers. Look what the world has given us with the Bethesda products! Skyrim is 5 years old and is still relevant in any current game of the year discussion. This title has not reached that level but it has the possibility. As far as updates to this game?? After i promised to not "buy" any other games i started to keep an eye on this one. I started in January and by May there were significant additions and changes to this title so that i decided to break my decision and purchase this game.  I am not sorry i did...\n\nbtw i have significantly more time in this title than is illustrated.","May 12, 2015","true","1.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

This game is obviously unfinished, and not all features work yet; none the less,I have greatly enjoyed playing it so far. The graphics are cute, and I like all the little snippets that people say when I order them about.

Same as Age of Empires, or Rise of Nations. There is clearly a spin on it, a different approach, that obviously still needs some tweaking and other additions.

There are quirks just like in any Alpha game but the dev community is always listening, responding, and has updates monthly.   Most EA games dont have that on here at all.  I am not a fan boy of anyone game, there are games I like and games I dislike, but the potential for this game is amazing.\n\nSo, basically this game is like any other settles game at first.  Its basic management and survival ... food, shelter and security then go out and beat up others take their stuff. Ah but here is where it gets good.  You dont just build an army to go out and pick on people no you get an adventuring party!  So the chaos enues from there as you beat up monsters, dens, and dungeons and slowly build up your buildings and village.  so this is all fine and all but while I reccomend this game I have one question for the devs.\n\nEnd game?  What is the proposed end game?  Will the village get so big it dies off. thats not reasonable.   Maybe when a village gets so large it starts off and sends out a new group to a new area, like starcraft style?  That would be great then you might even get support from your other village and build it up too.  So thats my only concern with this game, what will be the endgame to it.  Could you imagine the workshop options you could have here?\n\nOther than that this is a great time suck game and I have killed lots of hours playing it and replaying it.  I hope you like it to and please see it for what it is and not the Alpha errors everyone gets it, its in Alpha ...

It took me about 3 hours to wipe out all the creep camps on the Easy map, have one of each production chain maxxed out, and about 100 villagers. After that, there was really nothing to do (I couldn't build more units, move to a new territory, craft better gear, etc.) However, if I could have kept upgrading/expanind, I definitely would have. Granted, I haven't played any more difficult maps, so there could be a greater level of depth already built into this pre-release.\n\nOverall Mechanics: Economy is similiar to Banished with a bit more depth. You construct a town that provides for typical basic needs of any citizens in an RTS, as well as gold/stone/iron etc. While you can assign villagers to different jobs, they essentially do the rest from there (you have the option to micro manage, but why bother). You can upgrade buildings to allow a greater workforce, as well as research technologies for each building. (Level 1 building = 4 workers, lvl 2 = 8, lvl 3 = 12; each building has 3-8 technologies that basically increase the gather range or add xx% to production). Right now, the most in depth production chain is about three buildings/layers deep (wheat farm [wheat] -> windmill [flour] -> bakery [bread]). Once you build a barracks, you can train archers or halberdiers (ranged or melee units) and use the blacksmith to outfit them with equipment. You can research recipes at the blacksmith and find better ones in the wild. Basic resources come from your organic production, whereas the more advanced ones are found after clearing creep camps.\n\nGlitches: I did experience a few crashes, but they only seemed to occur as I was exiting back to windows anyway, so it didn't matter. There were some issues when I'd craft/find an item, it would show up in my inventory as a blank box that I could not inspect or equip. The only villager AI isues I came across so far was when I was building the advanced walls, they would sit there and "construct" for the rest of the game, which meant my production buildings would not longer recruit them since this never-ending-construction seemed to take them out of the available labor pool. Clicking on the mini-map would direct me to a random place on the map, which was annoying. Overall, very minor issues that I am sure can be easiliy fixed.\n\nBalancing Issues: stockpiling stone/planks/iron/gold was fairly simple and quick, but I continuously had a problem keeping enough of the consumables on hand. Even when the bread production chain was fully upgraded/maxxed out (36 villagers in a population of about 90), I constantly ran out of bread. I was also constantly out of meat, fish, and vegetables. While not so much a balancing issue, I could not find a "find idle worker" button. This would have been handy when I wanted to specifically recruit only archers, as the auto-recruit for the barracks produces a mix of archers and halberdiers.\n\nOverall, this was a pretty fun game. I think it has a decent amount of potential. It has a great environment (again - it reminds me of Fable, specifically Oakvale) The devs have clearly made a solid foundation from which to continue to add depth. I look forward to future updates.","October 25, 2015","true","13.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

If they released the early access where the game is now they would not have so much of a mixed review.

It's clever and, in some areas, already polished.\n\nI hope the developers continue down this path, I'm quite excited to see how it turns out.\n\nDefinitely worth looking at if you are interested in an old timey city builder with some serious RPG slants. There are a lot of negative comments on this game, but mainly due to the crap sandwich this game use to be. If you look at recent reviews, you'll see that the reviews have come nearly as far as this game in the right direction.\n\nIn conclusion, This is a pretty great game that was pretty bad when it first came out.

It's very, very good-looking, has a great soundtrack, and an appealing UI. Playing it is very soothing - it's very smooth to play, and I reallllly enjoy the graphic style. It reminds me a lot of The Settlers series. I'm really surprised to find an alpha indie game looking this good.\n\nFolk Tale still has some way to go, with plenty of stuff still to implement, but it's definitely worth looking at if you're into this type of game.

You build using settlers and huts to increase settlers.  I like the medieval twist using Kobalds and quests (Though I have yet to be able to do any quests.)  graphics are pretty cool, nothing great. Some big issues thus far though. 1:  The adviser who says you need more bread or meat or whatever, never stops once it starts and repeats every second.  There needs to be a way to turn that off.  2: You need to VASTLY improve the skill levels to match each accordingly.  Right now even on training level it is nearly impossible to learn or improve your village.  That's ridiculous.  Training level shouldn't need advisors beyond that of the actual training and frankly shouldn't have any worries at all as training level should strictly be a learning level ONLY..  You should be able to build anything and you should never lose settlers.  The next level, the beginners equivelent should only be slightly harder, needing a timy bit of food and maybe losing settlers only after having no food for like 30 minutes or something.  Then tweak the higher levels accordingly.    3:  When you send a Villager to do something they dance around at the spot for a few minutes before doing anything, wasting valuable time you have to gather resources and build things.\n\nOverall the concept is pretty cool and has the potential to be a pretty decent hit but much work needed yet before it's really playable for any length of time.","May 7, 2015","true","5.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Spaced appart and marked clearly"\n\nSo I was responding a to  a4440a's review and steam said my post was to long, what I was going to post:\n\n"I have no issue that they askedd for positive feedback. They even said in the request that if you feel that the game does deserve the negative feedback it's been getting that it's on them. But requesting the people who do enjoy it to have their voices heard is not wrong. People are WAY more likely to post things when they feel negatively about something than when they feel positive. As a person who works in retail we ask for customer feedback to know how we did andd to see that we made a persons experience enjoyable. So few people actually give positive feedback for anything and there post looks no different then when a clerk asks for feedback about the service. And more than 98% of people don't give feeddback if not asked. I know this because 2% is our goal and we rarely hit it with asking.\n\nAlso the Dev's seem to be pretty good at responding to every review. So the dev team is clearly still active. Even coming back to this review after they had responded when a new patch came out. That's fantastic service. "\n\nIt should be noted one of his/her main issues was that they had asked for the fans and people who were enjoying the game to give feedback. They didn't force anyone to. They merely, and quite frankly very politely, asked people to give feedback. Yet he/she, like many others, made it seems like a horrible thing that they had done. like they had enroached on their freedoms and it was unethical and immoral. infact a few posts stated it was immoral. . . SERIOUSLY????\n\nAnd it made me realise ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is that people have been treating this game and dev's like dirt. This game is someone's and like a group of someone's dream. They may not get patches out as fast as some other dev's but they also haven't abbandoned it like SO many early access games before them. I've been watching this game and sure it's taking a while but they are working on it. It is looking good slowly but surely. They're working hard a doing a damn fine job. If you really don't think so then why not try writing some lines of code to fix the issues you are having with the game yourself and submit it to then, and wait to see what conflicts it causes in the code. Then A) you could see just how long it takes to actually write the code and B) how it almost always creates more errors that will need fixing. And hey if you do a great job maybe they could use you or you could make your own game, who knows. You don't that's for sure, not till you try.\n\nto wrap up keep it up guys/gals ignore the haters and the nay sayers. The doom talkers and the ones who act holier than thou. They aren't making a game they aren't dealing with crap you are and they are just being plain old rude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs promised (key dramatic drum beat) BUM BUM BUM (Thank you band, I'd be lost without you)\n\nREVIEW TIME!!!!!!!!\n\n\nSo been watching this game for a while, and as horrible as this may sound at first I ask you to hear it out, I even pirated this game when it had that short story with the monastery/temple thing in the snow with if memory serves were-wolves? I don't really condone piracy flat out but clearly not against it. It's a grey area for me. I believe in supportive piracy. Demo's don't really exist any more and the few that do are tailored to be as appeasing as possible which sometimes ends up being NOTHING like the game in question. So I coined the term supportive piracy, in which is you like what it was you pirated you go out of your way to support them by buying the program, movie or whatever and or donating too them the amount. Because if you support them they will make more of the things you like, and not go bankrupt. Rules for supportive piracy is if you find yourself playing it for the full story line and enjoying it. . . SUPORT IT\n\nFind your self playing it for more than 5 hours?. . . SUPPORT IT\n\nWhen back to play more after the first week you DL'd it. . . SUPPORT IT\n\nAny one of those equalls a support even if say you only played for an hour the first week then a week and a half (or longer) later you go back and play again. Yea that counts.\n\nSorry rant. . .\n\nAs I was saying I had pirated the game. It was lacking in content, and was over fairly shortly. But it had promise, still does.\n\nso I followed it on steam and added it to my wish list so I'd know if it went on sale. It did and my buddy gifted it to me, before I was ready to buy it and after I asked for a diff game.\n\nBut I decided to try it out again it had been a while, a LOT had changed graphics are way better and the interaction with your citizens is really cool. the voice acting is fun and enjoyable and has that classic british. . . smart ace to it. Is there more to be done? Sure but it's coming along very nicely and i'm excited to see what they do. It's also going a diff way then I originally hoped it would but that's not surprising I have yet to find the game style I have envisioned in my noggin.\n\nAs someone else had said it's a bit like banished but simpler. And not just in difficulty but also in concept. However also has different features, that being the exploring RPG elements that make the simpler city building aspect fit. I don't think the hard ships and deep intricacies that banished has would work well while you're out leading your troops in battle.\n\nAll in all I'd say the game is very enjoyable\n\n\n\nFor those wondering about the game concept in my noggin\n\nI guess the closest thing it would be is a castle/city builder. But builder is wrong word. . . more like upgrader. You take on the role of the person/thing/higher power? in charge. You don't control the movements of anyone (like in banished). You control what get's upgraded where funds go, perhaps the blacksmith which allows him to upgrade his furnace, or higher on additional help. Funds into captain of the guard so he can reinforce the walls with more guards or the barracks for having an army. You can also decide if certain upgrades need to be researched or if an attack is coming to call the citizens in behind the walls. As time goes on and the city grows outer walls would be made, your army goes out and secures roads from bandits. if you declare war your generals and armies attack but how and when they choose. your only concern is uprgrading the castle, city and such.","May 6, 2015","true","2.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

The art was a fresh detour from the norm, and the RPG aspect gave the game a more active feel. It is because of these specific things and all the pontential that I'm sad to say: this game has no direction. When is say that, I don't mean it has no direction in the sense that it lacks an attainable goal, nor do I mean that it is akin to Minecraft--the game that made directionless fun popular; Folk Tale is somewhere between what the devs said they were doing, and what a niche in the community wanted. This game doesn't deliver an immersive city building experience--in a fantasy setting, because of an impotent AI that doesn't work half the time; however, Folk Tale also doesn't deliver on its adopted promise to be a great sandbox game, because it has a particular fantasy, RPG/RTS feel to it that requires a strong, immersive base to stand alone in the sandbox enviroment. Even when you ignore the broken AI, odd development choices, and lack of clear direction, Folk Tale still suffers from a start/stop update cycle that adds incomplete, often empty features; during my time in Folk Tale it was common for me to come across a menu option, or tab and be met with "not avalible in this version of Folk Tale." The worst instance of this came when I attempted to change the scroll speed in-game; I quickly discovered that the control menu didn't exist, but the menu tab for controls was present.\n\nAll things considered, I can ignore the fact that this game isn't what I originally paid for, that it still isn't even close to being a true playable beta, or even that many pieces of the current build are either broken/barely working. The reason I can't reccomend this game is because the developers lied; the developers lied--and continue to lie--because they refuse to admit that they've messed up. The developers pretend  that everything is as it should be, and that the game is progressing steadily; the truth is that this game will likely never be released, and if it is will likely be riddled with bugs and unfinished content. Today I gave this game a final chance to impress me after waiting almost a full year for it to be developed more. Today I finally let go of any final hope that Folk Tale will be anything to me, but another reason I don't trust or wish to support indie developers.\n\nIn my humble opinion I would not reccomend purchasing this game, even once released--if it ever is--I would strongly advise anyone to steer clear of it.\n\nDo not waste your money.","January 23, 2015","false","3.4"," 86 of 172 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","86","172","4","6"

Gone is the scripted story and static building placement...instead, you now have a relatively free-form light village builder.  It reminds me a bit of "Banished", but with a few differences.  For one, it's not as harsh.  You can also loot enemies in the environment and equip things on your villagers (in addition to individually leveling them up). Combat is a bit bugged right now...that is, enemies will retreat and auto-restore their health to full making them hard to kill.  With that said, I'm enjoying the direction this game is taking.  It's important to stress what I said earlier about the game taking a while to develop...this isn't your "three months in Early Access then done" deal.  It entered Early Access sometime in 2013 and won't be done till 2016 (per the game's Steam store page).  Those seeking instant gratification and fast/regular updates may want to wait a while.  I'd recommend it for those who enjoy "Banished" or "Hearthlands", though keep in mind that the resource chains aren't nearly as complex (at least at the moment).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Djetg6erOK8","May 6, 2015","true","6.2"," 33 of 66 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","33","66","0","1"

Frequent updates on website pertaining what their goals are next.  Good changes and ideas implemented from when the game was initially placed on Early Access.  In addition, you can look for yourself on the steam discussion forums how much they have interacted with the playerbase.\n\nDefinitely a game that they keep working on and haven't abandoned; statistics show they hired more people to their small team some time ago.  Granted, such was researched by myself last year and I haven't the time to do such lately.  However, they frequently release videos and updates on their website located at:  http://www.gamesfoundry.com/default.aspx\n\nSandbox mode is fairly fun to partake in.  The game's future overall looks bright.  Hoping early reviews of the early access campaign won't affect them too much when they finally have a working released version.  The RPG village builder idea also seems to be coming along quite nicely.\n\nWhen it comes to the actual content of the game, I will not make mention.  It's early access, and things will change.  Their website has many videos, and there are other who have their opinions on the matter.  In addition, there many be many videos online, though most of those are from the early edition of early access when it first released.  The game has since be vastly updated with new technology and is no longer limited to the tutorial (and there are no longer building placement restrictions outside of said tutorial).\n\nThis review is of my opinion on April 10th, 2015.  Most of my gameplay time is from early, early access and late last year.  If you're into supporting development teams, this is a good one to invest in.  I'm constantly coming back to look at updates out of interest.  In addition, the game developer seems to be open to criticism -- as most should be -- to ultimately make for a better product in the end.","April 10, 2015","true","149.2"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","14","28","0","0"

To be honest it wasn't exactly what i was expecting. The small RTS elements in this city bulder were new and exciting for me but some bugs and a lack of features implemented stopped me from fully enjoying myself.\n\nI'm giving this game a thumbs up because while still somewhat buggy, it's early access and has a lot of potential. I can see how some people would find it worrysome that this has been in development for over two years but the developers are still highly active and that to me proves they don't plan to just abandon it but rather will make it into something special. If the game ever reaches completion then the 16$ CDN i paid for it was a steal.  that said I probably will wait a few months before opening this bad boy back up and seeing where it's headed.","May 6, 2015","true","8.2"," 21 of 42 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","21","42","0","0"

Early Access means their still working on content. If the game play is solid, that is a bonus for me and I don't care if its early access forever, as long as they keep pushing content, however long it takes. I watched someone play it on Twitch. Looked like Banished but with spiders! With the sale price, I couldn't pass up buying it.\n\nDoing the tutoral now. Its Got KoBolds!!! My villagers beat up the Kobolds with their fists! One of the Kobolds dropped a shield. We are on our way to becomming Masters of the Universe!\n\nThe gameplay is solid so far.  The only thing I see that is needed is an "Idle Pesant" button or/and a Rally Flag, at this point. I might have to gather up my slavess.... err peasents for some beatingss.. errr, letcures.\n\nYou like Survival! You like pushing peasents around!

You set off on your journey as you build lumber mills and stone works to collect the necessary resources for further your construction. Firewood, food, clothing, mead and many others resources are just a few of the things your citizens will want as you progress to a higher Culture rating. Your culture rating will determine the current needs of your people and when they will ask for the next set of items to keep them happy and working, fail to anticipate there needs could spell doom for your town, but be ever watchful as there are enemies all about just wanting for their time to take your city down. A RPG style of hero leveling allows for your characters to grow with you as you explore and build your way to victory.\n\nPros:\n\n-	The beautiful graphics and music pulls you into the game and adds that immersion feeling as you delve ever deeper.\n-	The story is both well written and quite humorous at times, allowing you to grow a bond for the characters you control and care what happens to them as you make choices that will change the story line.\n-	The multiple choices you are presented with that can change the story from one play through to the next allow for the replay value to be quite high and very enjoyable.\n-	The controls of the game are quite easy to manage and allow for a very close view of your towns people or a high up god like view of your entire village.\n-	A simple at first building technique that opens up and becomes much more detailed as your understanding of the game grows, allowing for novice and expert players alike to find something here they can enjoy.\n\nCons:\n\n-	The game is still in early access so you are bound to find a bug or two from time to time. This isn’t so much a con as it is just a fact and often times doesn’t even factor into taking any of enjoyment away that’s to be had in the game.\n\nIn conclusion, Folk Tale is a fun city builder that will take you through a journey you won’t soon forget, hours of fun building your cities will make your time here both enjoyable for those who like combat and for those who don’t. 4 out of 5.\nAC-Gamer\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTyGAG_geVh6hZ5T_o3V9jTSsT_7IevXa\nhttps://youtu.be/jyXGJitOizg\nhttps://youtu.be/UpTCNwFMOok\n","March 26","true","11.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Even though it has been in my in for two years, I still like to come back to it from time to time to see what’s changed. As some of the negatives have said, there hasn’t been any ground breaking patches to where it jumps the game close to release, but hey, the devs are active and not giving up on their game, which is rare considering I've seen a few games go from amazing, to abandoned in less than a year or two.  So in some way, I can agree with the negative reviewers saying there hasn’t been a lot, because hey, I would like to see more too, but we aren't dealing with EA here.\n\nNow what I can't agree on is the negatives saying "I wasted my money on this game", "Before you say "Early Access Game" save your money it's not worth it.". I'm just going to say it...it's an Early Access Game. A lot of games aren’t worth their prices, for example, Call of Duty being 100bucks for a full game...not worth it, but some may think it is. And for the "I wasted my money" people, you "wasted 25 bucks"...that’s 3 hours of work. Also, it is an Early Access Game meaning you are choosing to pay the price of the game to aid in the development of the game. Honestly, now a days, EAGs and Kickstarters alike are a gamble because you never know if the devs will abandon it or not. So what do you do? Just make a decision, do you want to see this game become complete? Or can you live without it. If you are truly a gamer, you want to see a game you are interested in succeed and you won’t give up on it because it is taking a while. To put it in perspective, World of Warcraft took more than 5 years to develop...and it was developed with an already established gaming company with a huge dev team. So 2 years of a game with probably 1/6th of the staff isn’t bad for where the game is. You just have to look at it from a different angle.\n\nAll in all, I agree and disagree with the Reviewers but I still will recommend this game, especially since it's on sale atm, because of the dedication on the dev team alone and the fact that I'm a gamer and I want to see games blossom!\n\nDo what you want, but remember, you are helping DEVELOPE a game, you are not buying a complete game. It will take time for it to be finished, are you ready for the long haul?\n","May 5, 2015","true","2.9"," 28 of 57 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","28","57","0","12"

Although you can tell it is far from finished, what is available in terms of gameplay is enjoyable. So far this is a sandbox village builder with a little army building/combat.\n\nThe presence of good voice acting and polished graphics/UI is something I have missed with indie games and makes it feel like a quality project in the works. I really like being able to zoom in up close and watch the villagers go about their lives. Your military villagers have inventories and take upgraded gear and weapons, and I look forward to seeing that fully implemented.\n\nMicromanaging resource production is neat, though on the easy map not really necessary as there is no challenge to keeping up resources. At this time there are 3 maps to play in sandbox mode and they are not randomly generated yet. That will be a nice feature to see.\n\nAs far as drawbacks, it's too early to start critiquing. If I had to come up with a gripe it would be that the game can feel a little slow and it would be nice to have a hotkey to speed things up occasionally rather than tweaking it in settings. I also could not sit through the tutorial, but after skipping to sandbox it didn't take long to figure everything out with trial and error.\n\nI am excited to see where this game goes and the activity and responsiveness of the devs gives me hope that this could end up a really fun game at completion.","January 2, 2015","true","10.2"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","14","29","0","0"

Most of the negative reviews are people who weren't happy with this decision, as I initally was.  After spending some time in sandbox mode, I can see that this game is still going to be something unique and intersting.  With the sandbox genre getting beat to death by developers over the last few years, Folk Tale is a breath of fresh air and a fascinating perspective on the genre.\n\nThe resource gathering is challenging but understandable and logical.  The sense of humor is on point but not over-the-top.  The RPG elements of crafting, equipping, and experience for the villagers are unlike any other game I have played.  While only having spent 3 hours playing as of writing this game, each time I return to it I am greeted by improvements and new and fun mechanics to learn.\n\nDespite how interesting and intriguing the game itself is, the main point I wanted to make in writing this review is that this game will make you feel rewarded for supporting the developers in Early Access.  They are accessible, focused, responsive, and provide a great sense of involvement and community in the developing of this game.  Early Access can be messy, it can be fun, but it the case of Folk Tale, participating in Early Access is as much of an adventure as the game is.

I stopped playing the game for awhile but when i had come back to Folk Tale i saw that the game had developed from just an easy building tutorial game into something really exciting. The game mechanics have gotten updated and made the game more challenging and the amount of buildings and how the economic system in the game have become make the game just that more interesting reminding me of a stronghold mixed with age of empires online feel as the game uses the same popularity scale as stronghold but has the ransacking destruction of age of empires online when your villages are big enough and you go questing. The tundra and swamp maps are pretty challenging if you dont understand the game at first because of the lack of resources or even the amount of orcs coming at you all at once. Overall this game is a very fun game, very humorous and has tons of potential and i cannot wait until the game is completed! One thing i hope for is a added multiplayer option where you can build and compete against your friends in a rival trade town.","May 5, 2015","true","25.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I've played for about 9 hours so far.  I maxed out everything in my village and have killed just about everything on the map.  It seems when you chop down trees you have to replant with seeds.  So far the only way I found to obtain seeds is to kill monsters.  Eventually the monsters no longer respawn and then you can't find any more seeds.  So you wind up running out of firewood, and your villagers declare that your village sucks (literally) and start to leave.  I was unable to find a way to reverse the mass exodus, and became frustrated.  I really want to like this game, and I hope eventually I will when the devs finish with it.  Right now it just seems there's no way to sustain a permanent village in sandbox mode, and that's unfortunate.  I am going to give this game a thumbs up regardless in hopes that things will change soon.  Its worth the $15 I paid for it on sale.  I wouldn't pay much more than that though.","May 6, 2015","true","9.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

Not a lot was implemented, but I wanted to see where the game would go. After letting it sit for a while, I decided to pick it back up, and I've been pleasently surprised with how far the game has come. There's still a lot to be implemented, but this is a fun game overall. The graphics are good and the economy is fairly well balanced. The crafting system as of this review is still fairly basic, but both it and the building upgrade systems add depth. The music is quite nice and certainly adds to the experience. My one knock against the game so far is that the military units you can recruit are weak and, even with some in game improvements (armor and weapons), they do not stack up well to your opponents. So, while it's still very much a work in progress, it's a very playable, enjoyable work in progress.","October 24, 2015","true","10.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There is a new story mode which is a mice change if your board of creating huge villages with little cause except build massive awesome villages. It looks very promising for the future.

They are very transparent and you can always check them out on Twitch.tv\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/gamesfoundry\nOriginally posted by Games Foundry:From a project management and commercial point of view, the way we have to run an Early Access project is somewhat different than more traditional projects. We have to be extremely agile with a fluid project plan that isn't always optimal:\n\na) to be able to recognise and react to collective player feedback that may require entire modules to be rewritten;\n\nb) to respond to a constantly changing customer environment. Receiving negative feedback did lead to a reevaluation of project task priorities, resulting in a drive to deliver playable game mechanics above all else; This can be sub-optimal from a production efficiency standpoint, but highly desirable from a commercial standpoint; We've also had to increase transparency, frequency and volume of communication in response to the needs of the wider Early Access community due to growing concern surrounding crowd funding and some failed or ethically questionable titles in Early Access.\n\nc) to rapidly adapt to new learning in what is a very new approach to game development; Early Access is still very young as a process and mistakes are being made, but very quickly learned from.\n\nThis is definitely the most agile project I've run, with scope changing fairly regularly but in a managed way so that we can remain on track and on budget.","January 11, 2015","true","2.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I have been playing it for about 2 hours now and wow have they improved this game. The combination of village building, equipment to be found and equipped on everybody (villagers too), and dungeon exploration with your heroes is great! It reminds me of the early Settlers games, or the old game Knights and Merchants.\n\nPros:\nNice graphics\nFully customizable characters\nFree building, build where ever is the best spot for the building\nDungeon/Cave exploration is a good break from the normal gather/build\n\nCons:\nIt took them three years to get where they are now, so progress is a little slow, but it is there\n\n\nWhen all is said and done, I would say to grab a copy of this.

Not bug reporting I could see as the first openning page showed it was in Alpha. But no bug reporter in the game as far I saw; or no comment section about how to make the game better. Which would be nice. First time I played didn't played nesscially play correctly, and taxed my people. Second time went much better; food and resources are your primany starting assets. Of course if you can review my second game of it. I did much better and improved after about 40 minutes of playtime. I acctually liked the game more than then many in the genre. Graphics silmiar to World of Warcraft, yet that was some 10 years ago. Cartoonish yes. My kids could learn a lot about how much would it take a long long time ago to build an empire or a village. Although very boring if you don't use your hero to explore. Which I liked. To gain food from the start; it helps gives something to do while your people work. BUT DON'T FORGET ABOUT THEM, haha. Some werid things with how the game is played. I didn't like how I "techicnally" took over a an old builiding that looked like a mine. I personally think; there should be more like as it appered to be a mine. Which I could used. A of now in my second game, so far I got an extra pheasent. I like how easy access the game is. Very easy for kids to understand and think. "Well, If I save enough wood and stone, I could get..."  All builings mostly unlocked and yes, there are builinding options. One thing that would be exciting after playing for just 40 minutes; Is how deep the game could actually go. I played on easy. Normally I start games playing Hard. But have learned to play easy first to make it simple to go from easy to hard; then to medium and crush medium. But getting an exrta pheasent. Very Very usefull. I'm thinking of adding in another cottage just to see if gets more pheasents. Because they can work from the lumbermill or whatver it's called or the stone mason which give more resources. I also saw that the woodcutter's plant tree's. Yet, my fishwoman caught loads of fish and then would have to travel. So it's a game about location, location, location. Because if I do get exrta pheasents, which come by their own accord. Then it would be useful to have them pick ujp surranding exrta picking up things; food, wood, and stone. Yet again 40 minutes in Alpha 25 or 26 and I love it. Very rare for me to play a game and still want to play more of it, normally after I play I ponder how to play correctly. Almost like an addiction to video games to me again; coming back. Normally I'll play a few hours and then ponder and analize how I played. But this game is different it draws you in. Especially if your into RPG's villiage, city buildiers from an older time. Which I prefer. Tropico 5 is a very complicated game compared to this. This lays everything out for you. May take 3-4 times to get the hang of it. BUT PLAY EASY. And dev's don't speed up. Even it takes a couple or LESS years, haha. Take your time, Take you time; Good game I would pay $50-60 for. Which is very rare for me. But 24.99 for Alpha. A little steep. 19.99 would have been better. Remeber one comment box and you'll get a whole lot of advice, or bug reporter. Also remeber stick to your roots about those comments some mjean, some harsh; some useful; some actually from other players' who made the game with you.

In my first review it had it unique idea of being the ultra medival sandbox game of decade that Stronghold 3 should of been. But no instead we're given this while the game is 70% done so far.\n\nHere's what I don't like, to get straight to the point:\n\n-The music has changed from a nice and soft melody to a bland and boring soundtrack\n-The UI is small and clunky that even trying to change the size of the UI makes it feel too big.\n-The Gameplay resembles a lot of AOE 3 (which isn't a bad game but it wasn't a good game either).    To be more specific its VERY VERY SLOW at the start for its sandbox mode.\n-Graphics seem to be dated and ashy gray; it looks like it took a step backwards than when I first purchased the game in July 2013.\n-Development of this game is crazy slow. I bought the game when it was around 25-30% complete (Estimating).\n\nI don't like it. I'm not impressed and I'm disappointed at where this game has gone.","November 13, 2014","false","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

And he gains levels for killing stuff! and then you can choose to assign a skill point! SO that's an RPG element I guess?.. until he inevitably dies from clunky controls (and OP poison) and you discover that you can also send hordes of villagers to do the same thing if you really want.\n\nMeanwhile for a resource management game, it does not give me nearly enough tools or information to 'debug' my resource flows.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doc_rock2/recommended/224440/","doc_rock2","Doc Rock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doc_rock2/","485 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFolk Tale Review\nFolk Tale is a game that combines elements from a wide spectrum of genres including RTS, citybuilder, simulation, and RPG in order to bring gamers a totally new and unique experience. The game is still in Early Access and it already has an incredible history. I first began tracking this game during its successful Greenlight campaign. It reminded me of a modern take on The Settlers series but I was hesitant to jump on board until I could see whether it would follow the same path as so many of its predecessors or perhaps it would offer us something new. And it has.\n\nWhen Folk Tale originally applied for Greenlight status on Steam, it was planned to be a typical RTS citybuilder simulation with a full-length player campaign. And while many of the features had yet to be fleshed out, the core game structure was already in place. In order to give themselves the greatest chance of funding success, the game developers at Game Foundry decided to ask the Steam Community what they wanted to see in this game and an eventual Community Poll determined that most wanted to see Folk Tale as a sandbox game. I can't recall any other time when a game's development was halted mid-stream and completely shifted in a different direction based on our opinions. But here we are. The team from Game Foundry strapped in and accepted the challenge.\n\nThis has lead to some timely delays in the game's production and the developers have unfairly caught a lot of criticism for not releasing a finished product yet. Keep in mind, this is the game we decided on and they are doing their best to give us what we asked for even though it added a lot more work for them.  There are still a ton of cool features they plan on adding to this game and they are very active in its production, providing constant updates and weekly progress blogs to keep us informed every step of the way. The game is already in a stable, playable state though. So getting the game now is not a bad idea. And, because the developers are so open and active with the Community, you could possibly help shape part of the game's future.\n\nBut what can you expect from Folk Tale right now? For starters, the graphics for this type of game are very rich and full of vivid detail. There is a fully-rotational 3D camera that operates smoothly and easily. The user interface is in place and functional, although many of the mouseover tooltips are still missing. Its not too difficult to figure out what each button does though. A majority of the sound effects and voiceovers are now finished. Most all of the buildings and economic/resource elements are in place and functioning properly. Multiple maps are available for play and editor tools have been included already so the Steam Community can already begin working on their own custom additions. The mobs of creatures have been released into the wild and will offer a bit of a challenge during your otherwise tranquil building experience. Loot and treasures can be gathered after defeating enemy threats, which can be used to equip your villagers and troops with better armor and such. A lot of research and upgrades have been added to the game already, but even more is on the way.\n\nMany of the planned features are still being developed though. Building upgrades have not been implemented as of yet. Eventually, heroes will be added into the mix but are not available at this time. The villagers and troops have abilities and skill points to be distributed as they gain experience, but currently this feature is not working. All of the villagers still share the same facial image in the user interface when selected. Other units are expected to be added in the future as well (wizards, for example). And since changing from a story-driven campaign to a sandbox style of play, there is no longer a tutorial to get players started. I believe one will be added fairly soon, and if not, I strongly urge the game developers to consider including one in order to familiarize new players with the basic concepts of the game. While I thoroughly enjoy the game already, it is quite clear that there is still a lot of work to be done. If you're one of those players who are only interested in finished products then you might be waiting on Folk Tale for a while.\n\nThe Good:\n=======+  Rich and highly detailed graphics\n+  Quality sound and voice acting\n+  Fully-rotating 3D camera w/smooth controls\n+  Variety of buildings and research\n+  Well-designed economy and resource structure\n+  Extremely mod-friendly w/editting tools included\n+  Varying difficulty to offer greater challenge\n+  Save game feature implemented and working\n+  Friendly and active game developers\n\nThe Bad:\n======-  No tutorial included\n-  No skirmish options or goal-oriented features\n-  While stable, there are still a few bugs\n-  Mouseover tooltips only half-complete\n-  Many features still not implemented or under development\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n===========Folk Tale is still a long way from completion, but is highly enjoyable already. The team at Game Foundry laid out plans for a game that will offer a multitude of exciting features and they continue to work diligently trying to make it a reality. If they continue down this path then Folk Tale is sure to be a strong candidate for GOTY (whenever its fully released). For those who enjoy real-time citybuilding simulations, I'd encourage you to go ahead and buy the game now since its fully playable. Those who are impatient and only want to experience finished products should add the game to your Wishlist and wait for completion or else you will most likely have a negative experience given the game's currently un-finished form.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","April 29, 2015","true","76.6"," 71 of 146 people (49%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","49","71","146","4","10"

Folk Tale came across my screen one day and I was very impressed by it's intended scope so I immediately purchased it in early access. It's been a year since then and I can honestly say this game has come a long way. It's an incredibly ambitious game. No other city sim comes close to the complexity of strategy and rpg elements as Folk Tale in my opinion. It's beautifully rich in detail in respect to both graphics and game play. It fills a depth nitche that was absolutely missing in Banished. Having each individual in your village have a character sheet and equipment can feel a little overwhelming at first, but once you become familiar with how the game is played it's much easier to manage. I can honestly say I never expected this game to get here. It's worth every penny and then some. If you like city builder and rpgs you HAVE to give this a try. There is truly nothing else like it.

The visuals are appealing and I love the open nature of the gameplay. The small dev team have done an excellent job in providing regular updates and they listen to the community. The usual caveats apply to Folk Tale as with all Games that are in early access so don't expect a finished game as yet.

I played it for a while until I gave up due to bugs. Tired playing it this week and found that the game seems to be worse. Like most other players i bought the game due to the visual effects and the promise that it had. But now the developers seem to have canned the game because they got their money out of it for an unfinished product so what do they care if they finish the game. Since this game I have not bought a single Early Access Game because I found that most other games out there never really have a final release they just remain unfinished or don't live up to their promise.

But, quests are ridiculous, you can finish them and save, then when you load the game to play again, the same quest is there to be completed again. Its so nice to finish quests, looting chests to find armor/weapons that only fit your main hero, but are worse than the base armor/weapons. Whats the point of that?\n\nStone takes forever to get, every other material seems to stack up fast, but not stone. Then when you finally get enough stone to build something, you get raided by some crazy half-animal warriors, and your 3 city guards aren't enough to defend the city while your one hero is out trying to complete quests you'll have to complete again. And science forbid that your barracks gets attacked (because it will be destroyed in seconds, like every other building) building hitpoints are based on lego models, and the developers must have shot at them with guns to see how fast they'd be destroyed.\n\nThe game just needs some simple fixes to the basic mechanics, and needs more help with other aspects, such as heroes, and city guards. Also, using two inventories to equip characters with armor/weapons is annoying. Plus, I want it to be easier to find each type of worker.\n\nI'll update this review as I continue playing updates. At the moment, don't buy this game for full value, or even... 20% off (which is what drove me to buy it) The game has promise, it reminds me of Fable, which is fun, but just needs help.","December 20, 2015","false","2.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

Then they took one look at it, threw up all over the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, andsent it to The Wall, to serve out the rest of its digusting, crap life, plagued by the "free-folk," White Walkers, and the knowledge that they will never have hair as great as Jon Snow.\n\nI have rarely ever given a game a thumbs down. I usually find some sort of saving grace in a game. I purchased this quite some time ago, I attempted to play it and the tutorial was so dry and uninspiring so I gave up on it. Fast-forward a few months later I really get the urge to play this game. I re-install it, and decide to opt out of the tutorial and dive into the game. It's good at being simple enough to not need to really look at instructions or a guide/tutorial. However the game is borderline TOO SIMPLISTIC. Half the items you click on say: "THIS HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET." The other half, that do work are filled with so many bugs that you want to cry.\n\nThere are barely any sound or visual cues, the game doesn't do a good job in telling you when your town is under attack, there is one sound cue "YOUR BASE IS UNDER ATTACK." However it only happens after somebody pretty much already dies. Visually many of the creatures are so tiny that even when you watch your town, you have not a clue that there's a god damn spider killing people.\n\nMy Windmill was glitched out the ♥♥♥. It rendered 3 townsmen as "ghosts," as in they were there, not clickable, but weren't farming. The tier 1/3 walls make no sense, there's no cost on them, yet they do take resources and I calculated how much it would be for the wall, but when I built one section it refused to let me build any other walls on the entire map. I tried everything to fix this.\n\nThis game may have potential, if it were 2008. The whole concept seemed cool, but the developer's take on it is so dated. To re-address my previous point, they combined two great games. The RPG elements of Warcraft 3, and the town building experience of Banished, but they somehow managed to only take the awful parts of both games, making this probably the worst experience I've ever had playing a "city builder."\n\nThis game is quite awful. I have not met a single person that played this game and actually enjoyed it. Yes, I know what you're thinking I only have 1hour on this game. I usually hold judgement of a game until I either beat story mode, or have at least 10 hours in the game. This is a very huge exception just because I am uninstalling and never playing this horrid game again.\n\nOverall I would give this game a 3/10. This is the lowest I have EVER given ANY game. All in all they tried something out, they had a great concept that was butchered with awful interactions. Your "main character" in the game, the dude that explores and beats people is underpowered, he comes with a healer who sometimes refuses to leave him, and other times runs around the other side of the map because I guess they stopped liking each other. Half the buildings make no sense, some don't even work properly (the bakery), yet you are told your villagers DEMAND it. This game is just so incomplete, broken, and left such a sour taste in my mouth, I cannot justify it getting a better review from me in this lifetime unless they fix all the bugs and make it playable. Even then I don't think they would get anything more than a "meh" from me.","September 20, 2015","false","0.9"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","43","10","23","4","10"

At the time I was very angry about a lot of things.  first being the fact that shortly after backing it.  I found myself un-able to play it at all.  Last week after the patch 0.3 I got my first crack at actually playing the game and walking thru the in game tutorial.   I was shock!  Finally I could understand and play the game with easy.  No more broken basic needs.  Or at least I didn't encounter any.  Last year I would not recommend this game to anyone.  For fear of losing a friend.  The game was so flustrating.  Most of the common stuff was broken or not even there at all.   Today I found it playable and while I think the game progression is rather slow.  I am happy to say its been worth the wait.   I feel a lot of folks will not know what to do with this game though.  Do you play it like warcraft 3 build a economy and conqueer X enemy?  Not so much.  Its more on the lines of Banish I think.  Like a sim settlement builder type of thing.  In the near future that will probably change with heros, and dungeons coming in to play.   I would recommend this on 2 things.  First they dev's have a monthly blog supporting the up comming ideals and fixs, and second its fun to play.  Don't take my word on it.  Get out there and give it a try!

First the Pro's: Easy to learn reminds me alot of Age Of Empires where you collect resources. Reminds me of Colonization where settlers come over when you are doing good:) I went and tried the tutorial and it helped me with 90% of the game.  You can assign any inactive to any job & you can change them up.Now the Con's You really have no way of knowing how many peasants are inactive until you want to build and there is no way you can call them over to any 1 spot where you can assign them tasks. Also you really can't tell how your research is going accept that it tells you when you are done. Unlike Civ series where it tells you how many turns left to get to your ending reseach.\n\nOver all it feels like Civ series but on a smaller scale. With a little more work it could be a Fun  game without the frustration you may feel from time to time. Is it worth the asking price maybe.

I've player Settlers since Settlers two, I've played the Anno series, Sim City series - any kind of management / city buidling game, I really look forward to. It is an underserved market, and Folk Tale had the potential to be really cool.\n\nBut then, the devs threw their vision out the window to try to appease to everyone (I mean, sandbox games are the hip thing now, right? Right?! Everyone loves sandbox! So hip! So cool! Like beards and old bicycles and plaid...yeah.)\n\nBasically, this is going nowhere. It has been in Early Access for "A Very Long Time". I really don't know what's going to come out of it, but I can't recommend anyone buy this until it's done and released - at which point, you might at least have a chance at knowing what you're buying.\n\nF*@*!* Early Access.","May 6, 2015","false","1.3"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","36","5","14","4","2"

Currently lacking any solid mechanics that makes me want to continue this game.\n\nCombat:\n"If you enjoyed Warcraft 3,..." After playing a couple of hours, this statement makes me wanna cringe. The combat is absolutely horrendous if you are or were a serious WC3/SC1/2 player.\n1. This game doesn't allow quick changes in the screen: when my heroes were bound to '1' by pressing ctrl+1, pressing '1' repeatedly won't take you to the screen where my heroes are. It just 'selects' them.\n2. When pressing F1 (or F2,3,4...), the screen SLOWLY moves towards the hero's location. This is very annoying.\n3. Apparently, there are no commands for stop or hold position: units go on full aggressive mode. Extremely annoying.\n4. No hotkeys for hero abilities.\n\nCity building:\nEven Age of Empires 2 has WAY more diversity, variety of resources, and construction upgrades.\n\nThere's more.

The communication between the developer and the community is fantastic to say the least, probably the best I've seen yet. The game itself goes through regular substantial updates that actually add real content to the game (surprising I know). Even though right now the game has plenty of content to play and enjoy, especially with the recent 3.0 update, every update moves the game forward to being better and better. The game is great now and I honestly cannot wait until it's finished and is an amazing game!\n\n*Edit* And to all the reviewers stating that "this isn't the game they bought 2 years ago" or that "I thought it would be a story but they took that all out for nothing", these developers (unlike many in early access) actually put forward a choice to their community. They set up a survey for everyone to take to get their input on the direction the game should follow http://blog.gamesfoundry.com/2014/05/folk-tale-player-satisfaction-survey.html and really listened to those who were playing the game. SO all these people complaining here, this wasn't the devs who suddenly felt the need to take out your favorite part of the game, it was the community saying it wanted more sandbox and village management over story.

Unfortunately this is going to be one of those games in my library that won't get dusted off. I have periodically checking to see how the progress is going.

This game is far from ready. Having bought this game within the first couple of weeks of its release I am appalled by the lack of progress and content that has been added to this game. Being released over 16 months ago and having little to none progress to show for it, I feel like I've been utterly ripped off. The game is not ready and is a long way to go before completion. The dev state that this game is 46% playable in its current state, a state which is missing a core component of its gamely. Sandbox mode. The only update I've seen happen in the last year is a slummy map and character editor being added to the games content. A feature which is utterly useless considering you cannot play the game at all. The only feature which you are able to access is the tutorial mode which has a buggy save system. The idea for this game is rather good, which was one of the main reasons which compelled me to buy this title in the first place. Even though I am fully aware that this game is an INDIE title in the ALPHA stage, I am utterly appalled by the lack of progress and at the same time amazed by how well the developers are doing. Constantly updating their blogs and making new videos and moderating the forums. Maybe if they spend less time on the forum and editing their blogss and videos and more time on the game, we would see some progress.\n\nDo not buy\n\n-A","August 25, 2014","false","2.4"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","5","15","0","0"

So much promised content but nothing works when implemented the scope for this game has just grown out of proportion.\n\nAlways hopefully and after so long in EA I figured surely by now they would have some semblemence of a nearly complete game.\nUnfortunately this is not the case. While that have added in a small questline, the issue is that it is very small and also buggy. Buttons still don't work.\n\nProgress on this game is so slow, the developers seem to spend more time writing long blogs about the changes they are making vs actually working on the game.\n\nNot worth the price.\n\nUpdate 28/3/15\n\nafter leaving this game for up to 6 months i figured the devs would have had time to flesh it out a bit. Sadly it is still fill of broken features, now there all these shiny new buttons that dont actutally work.\n\nThe game has a small amount of playable content but with no real direction and alot of the features still not working it gets boring pretty quick.\n\nVery slow development. I would still not recommend.\n\nPrevious review from about June 2014:\n\n\nAt first glance this game looked really enjoyable the tutorial was fun and and interesting with a little bit of everything.\n\nyou got to start building a town and learn what the different buildings did, you got to make an army and go on a action filled adventure killing all sorts of monsters. The tutorial introduced a game I thought I could really get into.\n\nSadly the actual game is nothing like the tutorial. Currently there is only a broken sandbox mode, half the buttons don't work, the controls are different to the ones you use in the tutorial so you have to learn what the new ones are. With the majority of the building and character controls, even menus not working the sandbox mode is very limited.\n\nThe tutorial is misleading and suggests the game is something it is not.\nThe development is slow and all around sandbox.\n\nNot worth the price.","July 3, 2014","false","30.9"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","3","11","0","0"

The tutorial seemed like it had promise and the videos seemed cool.  Until you play it and realize every single scene in the video is in the first hour of gameplay.  Then you get to sandbox mode.  A couple buildings and tier 1 units, and of course no storyline, because its sandbox mode. It is missing a lot of basic functionality, the controls are clunky and sensitive, there is very little guidance toward what needs to be done and with the small selection of units it takes a couple hours to play through the entire content available.  Which sums up to a level editor with some basic testing ability.  The early access terms say that it is intended for games a few months from completion so devs can get some help to clear that final hurdle.  This is more like a kickstarter where they haven't done much of anything and want you to pay them to work on it anyway.  I saw this game summer of 2013 and figured I'd wait and see how it progresses, and over a year later I decided to give it a shot.  I cringe to think of what was available last year and I cringe even further to think of the damage this does to the early access program.  I would say you shoud buy this game if you want to support early access, but that won't apply for another two years.  Once the devs get this game to be within 6 months of a decent release, then I would support that statement.  For now I would say stay away until at least 2016.  By then it may be in a beta quality state closing on nearly released.  My prediction is that they jumped the gun on their release on steam, will work on it until the initial profits run out, then release a heartfelt statement on why its the communities fault they cant continue development.  Oh yeah, and I only played a few hours before writing this review because thats the amount of time it took to cover all of the content, and the game became nonresponsive and crashed.  So there's that.  On a final note, if this was one guy working between shifts and on weekends I would be much less critical.  For a full development team working full time, on a commitment to build a product they got people to pay for up front, this is unacceptable progress.","October 3, 2014","false","10.8"," 12 of 30 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","12","30","0","2"

I don't have a problem with how slow the updates are coming out, for me I voted on this game when it was in green lit I liked the vision they had and that's the game I wanted to play. So as soon as it was released I got it. My problem with the game is this is not the game I bought, their vision has changed alot since green lit, mostly because the community wanted the game changed to a sand box game. That's not what this game was going to be, they where going to add a sand box game play maybe at the end of devlopment, now that's all the games about this is not what I paid for. Getting community opinions is one thing & making minor changes is ok I am all for that, but changing the game in the ways that they have changed is not fair to the people who bought into the origanal vision of this game. In time this may be a great game if it's the kind of game you want to play, for me I will have to wait and see. I would wait until it is alot more developed before invisting in this game, who know's what other changes are in store for the future.\n\nOk I did what Games Foundry asked me to do in the comments. I gave the game another try. Even putting my previous grips aside about them making it a sandbox game first and taking away the story and choices your where going to have to make, I gave it a go.\n\nAfter spending a couple of hours playing it, I still cant recommend this game. Yes they have added more to the game then just a tutorial. As an RTS you have very little control of the game. You have no lists I cant tell who is doing what and who is doing nothing. I dont even have a way to click and bring all of my gaurds together at one point. In a game like this I need to click on list so I can oversee everything not just click on random buildings to get info for it. The way people move around to do stuff you lose track of who is where and finding them can get faustrating. Just like I want to click on something and bring all none working peasants to a single place so I can look over their stats and decide what to do with them and that cant be done easily if at all.\n\nThe game world looks nice and the game runs smooth graphics are nice. For me graphics dont mean much I dont care about eyecandy if I have a good playable game that is fun. Right now it is a good looking game with no real game play and clunky controls without any real way to manage your town.\n\nSorry I still cant recommend the game and it has nothing to do with the fact it aint the game a bought when it was released. I tried to give it a fair shake anyway and as it stands it still needs alot of work and the player needs to have alot more control of everything.","February 3, 2014","false","19.9"," 12 of 30 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","12","30","0","1"

Over 2 years and only 3 hours and even a new computer. Still waste of time. Steam just added a new refund policy and what do you know, the game has been in my collection for too long.

(I need to try the recent updates with the partially complete sandbox/builder)  I honestly do see the potential in the game, and I like the idea of where the devs are going with it. Whether or not it ends up being successful depends on what features make it into the final product, and how well those features actually mesh. Right now, there's not enough to go on to really make a "yes get it, or no, stay away" kind of decision. It is very much "wait and see how it develops" at this juncture.\n\nIn it's current state, I cannot recommend it. But, I would say, do keep an eye on it, and see where it goes.
