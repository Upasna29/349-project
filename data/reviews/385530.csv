It didn't really have any lore but that doesn't matter considering it's free. The game is so simple that you don't even need the ability to read in order to figure out what's going on so even if you were my neglected goldfish, you should still be able to play. I found this game intersting considering that it's about the most creative thing you will find in the last two-three years. If you take a look at the amount of re-used jokes in Family Guy or the shooter genre, you would probably agree.\n\nPros:\nIt's free\nThe tutorial shows gameplay while teaching you (which is cool I guess?)\nIt's simple\nIt's fun\nIt's exciting\nIt's like a MOBA but fun\nIt has few micro-transactions (I didn't really notice any but I'm pretty sure there are some)\nIt has better animations than the latest Scooby-Doo series.\nThe community isn't toxic (I suggest you become good before it does)\nCons:\nTHE TUTORIAL IS SO ♥♥♥♥ING LONG! THERE IS LIKE TWO PARAGRAPHS WORTH OF INFORMATION IN IT! (and no skip button :P)\nThey didn't explain when the English version is gonna release (not that I'm complaining but it is bad for others)\nThere is a framerate drop.\nIt has a tendency to go into a process of crashing.\nThe main menu may actually never load or show you how to begin to play as there are no buttons or loading signs...\n\nIf I were you I would begin to play now before everyone else begins too however I'm not you and actually have a life away from the computer screen (the one by the TV where that rusty playstationboy 64 is kept). If you can't speak Russian, I suggest you just watch the gameplay and flashing arrows pointing at cool looking things during the tutorial as you might or might not learn something. If you told me you had a life away from anything electronic related, I would think you were lying and then tell you to wait for the English version but who knows how long that'll take?","October 8, 2015","true","0.2"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","9","15","2","0"

Its a free to download game where you pay to speed up your progress which otherwise will take you weeks to months to be on par with other players who will already be in your games with better ships and equipment .\n\nAstroLords is a game where you build your city and then go on different quests such as boss fights,pvp and defense agains aliens .You can play agaist AI but very often some veteral player will get into your game and woop your ♥♥♥ with bigger ship . Most games like this are Pay to Win and it does feel underwelming for new player when my ship has 100 defense and the other guy has 170 or more .\n\nI think this game is trying to be like multiplayer Spacerangers which is not a bad thing .It is a really cool concept and game has a lot of depth behind it more so than boom beach and games of that type .

[-]\nA little bit boring soundtrack.\nBecause this game is real-time tactic game controls sometimes feel laggy like with a 1 second delay even in a fight with bots.\nNo option to increase the text size - it is really hard to read some messages and descriptions on a big screen.\nPay-to-Win. There are premium ships and accounts in this game - kind of obvious for Free-to-Play game...\nIn case you are interested in pvp - there aren't that much people playing at the moment.------\nConclusion\nI recommend this game because it's really interesting and fun.
