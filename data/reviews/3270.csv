But we have new toys (even if they are more like re-skins of our old toys), some new enemies, some new locations and same gameplay as in original. And these days we don't have enough of gameplay like that. This game made me realise how much i miss rhytm-jumping around the level and not be forced to press "E" everywhere.\n\nBosses now are almost straight-up damage soakers, but on the other hand puzzly bosses from originals, despite being somewhat interesting in concept, gave no clue what to do at all, unlike bosses in adventure-based games.\n\nStory is more coherent than in originals, but narrative is even worse - main hero just trying to cosplay Duke Nukem with all pop-culture references and quotes.\n\nIn the end, you buy one - you get one.

It has some flaws but still catches the Painkiller feeling even from the another view of a new bizzare but cool protagonist. A perfect descendant of the original.\n\nPros:\n- Everything that was good in the original presented here as well. Level design, enemies weapons, sounds, athmosphere.\n- Graphics. They worked on this one very very hard and i say well done! Nearly everything has been redesigned to fit the new protagonist. Perfect!\n- Weapons. Old weapons with new look and minor new capabilities! The new weapons. . .Your first weapon (besides the redesigned cube) is a head of your gaoler. Most people notice it’s a cool laser shooter but the real fun starts with it’s alternate fire. It shouts on your enemies with a really scary-good sound effect, causing most basic enemies’ heart stopping (aren’t they dead already? oh well. . .) and insta-kill them into a shaking, painfull death. What a truly satisfying weapon! I could do that all day! And the new living grenade. . .\n- Cool new enemies. Oh Geishas. . .hehe!\n\nCons:\n- Even more unbalanced enemies than in the original, more insta-killers on normal difficulty. The gang members and the flamethrowers (especially the miniboss) caused me practise violent vulgarisms but also made me stand up and relax a few mins so it was nearly healthy.\n\n8/10 – Fun oldskool FPS\n\n(Sorry for my English!)","May 9, 2014","true","13.4"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/3270/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Painkiller Overdose was released in 2007, three years after release of original Painkiller. It's a single-player "old-school" FPS with Deathmatch multiplayer. And a sequel or stand-alone second expansion pack for Painkiller. It started out as a mod, being made by fans effort, and then was made official.\n\nSo, technical side of thing. Game is supposed to still work on newest systems. It even supports wide-screen resolutions, even though HUD will be stretched. So it all should be cool.\nOh, and game is as bugged as it always was. It will crash on you. Randomly. Or in some cases always in same situations. Like, when you are trying to equip tarot card after beating some level and having some amount of gold. Nope, no idea what causes it, but you will relaunch game few times while beating it for sure.\nAND loooooong level loading times. I have no idea what changed, but these take few times more than in original Painkiller. It's painful enough to make you wish that this game had either "rewind time" or more console-like checkpoint system. Or just anything that doesn't require you to reload level after death. Like, lower difficulty to die less to. Yea, it's bad even today.\nOh. And don't be surprised if ragdoll of defeated demon decides to kick you up to moon. Ragdolls don't feel done properly here.\n\nAs for multiplayer? Well, it was mostly competive one like Deathmatch. And well, I don't think it was played like Painkiller was. And with GameSpy shut down, you can still connect, but Internet Browser will not work. So it will be hard to find servers with people. Community is probably dead there.\n\nStory follow Belial, child of demon and angel, who proved to be too powerful and chaotic-neutral in war between Heaven and Hell. Who was then imprisoned by Cerberus from Hell side, while being overseen by Samael from Heaven side. And now, after Lucifer death, he was freed and out for revenge. While travelling absolutely random locations.\n\nSo, it adds whole new campaign made of 16 levels or so. On theory it's great. It has great variety, as you will travel between such locations as fantasy land, space station, egypt, riot in modern city, zombie town and it has such interesting and amazing stages as Demon Farm and B-Film Studios. And borefest of green radiation like Power Plant, yes. And not only that, but each level is filled with at least some unique monsters, scarabs at Desert or living cardboards of B-Film monsters.\nAnd yet all this random variety gives this game a cartoonish feel. What Hell? What Nightmare? Travelling around globe and time and dimension, it seems. It doesn't help that most monsters seem to be take off the wall, stereotype, futher contributing to this feel. Not that it's a bad thing.\nIt also lost some feel due to different music, which is weaker. There are some interesting parts of fight music for some levels, but it's all errr "bland epic", so to say. Ambient part is weak too. Just nothing truly memoriable, so good bye awesome metal too.\nIt'a also nice how few enemies, including old ones, gained a special death animations. Even though they are so slow at times, you may not notice that enemy is technically dead.\n\nBut hey, the game has 8 weapons. Freaking eight. And knowing how seven of them has two alternative fire modes, which use serapate unqiue ammo, and seeing how weapon switching is instant, that pretty much means that you got 17 different fire modes that you have to remember and think about! It pretty much creates a "having bunch of toys" feeling. Sure, you have many different ways to kill demons. It's probably fun for most. But you see, since functionality and effectiveness pretty much always overlaps with few of them, you actually will be lost what to use. They all do fine job and nothing is absolutely more effective in each situation, so you don't really have to think on which weapon to choose. Which is one of the things that keeps old FPS interesting, having to decide on weapon use. Well, aside from running out from ammo for some.\n\nYou will spend time scrolling around weapons to find the one with some ammo left. That's quite a lot. And game doesn't always provide you with enough ammo. Sometimes there is too much, other times it tries to give you only for some weapons and sometimes there is just plain crisis. Power Plant level comes to mind. It shows that this game started as a mod, as sometimes it feels amateurish with difficulty jump.\nAnd I don't understand the use of acid flame thrower.\n\nAnd yes, what I said, there is difficulty jumps. Some encounters will prove to be harder than others. And it's not always at the end of the levels. Like, it uses same Monks enemies in Ragnarog level. But this time, they didn't place any laying corpses around for them to be busy throwing, instead they will keep telekinetically shove player, doing hitscan damage on him from few miles away.\nAnd then you got easy-easy bosses. Who got weak points. At least they aren't the worst of Painkiller.\n\nAnd then there is a hero who tries to be baadass and Duke Nukem like, throwing one-liners regulary. Same ones. Not too clever. So get ready to hear "taste like chicken" a lot. He only rarely drops something more interesting like "did that demon just revive another one?".\n\nAnd sadly, despite having big themes variety, it just ends up being monotonous. Original game was avoiding that, it had few surprises. It had more specialized weapons, more varied monsters. It wasn't too chaotic in themes. It just had flow. While in Overdose it just feels like you kill things and then repeat, not really mattering what kills and how you kill. Or at least not enough mattering. I don't really understand, on theory it's awesome, but on practise it's not so fun. Levels also feel sometimes on dragged side. Weaker music don't help.\nAnd I wish weapons didn't gib everything just because.\n\nGetting Tarot Cards is still not so fun, by the way. Just like in original game.\n\nSo, Overdose isn't a bad game. It's not good FPS either. It has variety in level themes, but it's too repetitive in gameplay. It's the kind of game that you will have fun with, but will have to force yourself with "I should beat this game fully because I want to beat games", otherwise you will abandon it in a half way.","July 3, 2015","true","13.3"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

If you're gonna choose only one, get the original (also on steam).\n\nThe rest of this review is the BS people are complaining about.\n\nNow to the people complaining about difficulty, weapons, etc. Yes the weapons are a little weak, but you get so much ammo and all of the enemies can be lead like sheep. You can hold every weapon at once and always have the melee/death-ray cube thing with unlimited ammo (its ♥♥♥♥ing strong too), so if you have ammo issues, your aim is abysmal. Really abysmal.\n\nAs for the difficulty: Enemies with melee attacks are strong because they should never catch up to you. Seriously, you can bunny hop more than twice as fast as they walk. You even slide up and over enemies when you jump.. Even when you do get hit it takes at least 10 hits to kill you from the standard 100 HP (max HP is something between 150-250, I've never really paid attention) PLUS armour.. And if you still can't handle the enemies, there's a difficulty setting for a reason.\n\nThe load times are fine. The one guy saying the times are 10+ minutes must have a hamster instead of a processor. The load times are a little longer than most, but theyre fine.\n\nEnemy variants are plentiful (new enemies every level so far).\n\nOverall there are 17 levels, 20 minutes or more each. Even rushing through the game, you get 5+ hours of gameplay.\n\nRecomended (but Painkiller: Black beats Overdoes)","March 10, 2014","true","2.8"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"

He thanks you for your time and promptly leaves. He walks down the street, and enters a building with a large sign reading "Mindware Studios." He makes his way to large conference room, full of more suited men, eagerly waiting to hear what he has to say.\n\nThe man takes the paper he was writing on, places it on the conference table, squats over it, and takes a great big dump on it.

You are simply not given enough bullets to work with, turning what should be tense or exciting fights against dozens of enemies into pure frustration as you run around looking for what few ammo pickups have been hidden across the large expanses.\n\nWhile being forced to make the best of it with your infinite ammo starter weapon, you'll have to slog your way through countless bullet spongey enemies, many of which spawn adjacent to you, teleport or use incredibly hard to see projectiles.  Unfortunately, your character, who seems defined primarily by his ability to recycle the same three or four unpleasantly dull one liners throughout the whole game, is not nearly tanky enough to deal with these battles very well.\n\nFinally, even the weapons are merely recycled clones of Painkiller Black's arsenal, making them not so much new as modded.\n\nThe not too shabby presentation of this game is let down by almost everything else about it, but especially by the total lack of respect for the player given in the design of enemy encounters.  Mixing and matching the strict ammo rationing of a Silent Hill game with the relentless hordes of a Serious Sam makes for a poor FPS experience, whether you're oldschool or new school.","November 19, 2014","false","7.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kirux13/recommended/3270/","kirux13","The Goose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kirux13/","310 products in account","AUDIO:\nVarious styles ranging from heavy metal, carnival music, and spooky haunted house style stuff that fits the level that you are in. There is a lot of variety here and it's nice to have so many different songs to kill baddies to. Belial is a one-liner spewing jerk throughout the game. It's nice to hear him comment at the beginning of every level because it can be humorous and it gives him personality, but good lord he never shuts up while you're playing. I LOVE THE TASTE OF EVIL SOULS IN THE MORNING.\n\nVISUALS:\nLike the original Painkiller, Overdose offers a plethora of different environments to gib enemies in. A snowy viking village, the battlefields of the American Civil War, and a movie studio production lot to name a few. Every level is drastically different in theme from the previous one, so it offers a good incentive to keep going and see just how diverse this game can get. The enemies change every level to match the setting, so you won't really run into them multiple times except in a level near the end.\n\nPLAYABLILITY:\nThis game does have a tendency to get hair-rippingly difficult at times. Mainly when they pit you against a horde of enemies that have some sort of quirk that melts your health to nothing in no time flat in a claustrophobic environment. Like the Riot level. Those flamethrower enemies are ridiculous. Aside from that little balancing issue, it is the same frantic and fast paced gameplay as the original Painkiller.\n\nDELIVERY:\nThe gameplay is very similar to the Serious Sam line of games, just set to a darker tone. There is a pretty large variety of weapons to choose from; some a bit more useful than others. If you've played the original Painkiller, they're basically just reskins of those weapons. Each level offers you a challenge to complete in order to unlock Cards which can be used to grant you special powers, such as faster speed or changing how much damage you do. Overdose is the type of game that focuses more on its gameplay than its story, with maybe 4 total cutscenes in the whole game that sum up the story to that point. Easy to understand and doesn't take itself very seriously.\n\nSUMMARY:\nSo the big question is: Should you play this game? My answer to you is that you should go decide if you want to play Painkiller: Black Edition first. If you play through that and need more Painkiller to satiate your appetite, then give this a whirl. it's not as balanced or polished as Black Edition is, but it is still fun to give a playthrough. If you didn't like Black Edition, than you are sure as hell not going to like this one. It is a game with flaws, but it still pulls through in the end.\n\nFinal Score: 7/10","February 10, 2015","true","12.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Level designs are pretty decent, though some are somewhat boring-looking, like "The Asteroids", but there are some really good ones, like the valley sections of "The Haunted Valley" look really pretty, or the entirety of "Studios", dedicated to fighting older monsters on sets of previous levels, along with new enemies, which makes it a very clever variation of enemy recycling (it's done so well you can't even complain about it). Soundtrack is really great though, both ambient and fight.\n\nP.S.

There are lots of collectables to find along the way, rewarding players for exploring the maps. This keeps the pacing of the gameplay steady and allows you to take a few deep breaths after murdering countless demons and trust me, you'll need to. Enemy ai isn't the best but they will team up to ko you. Some enemies have tricks up their sleeve to be careful of. Plus there are many environmental hazards to look out for such as lava, swinging maces etc. There are also tarot cards to collect which give you special powers when activated once per level. These cards are permenant and you can unlock them by satisfying certain conditions at the end of a level. The weapons are cooler than ever, you will get some really creative ones to try as well as your conventional shotgun. Levels are well designed and have lots of hidden ammo/secrets and tonnes of enemies to kill.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the protagonist, Belial who just happeneds to be a demon/angel hybrid is a far more entertaining character than Daniel and has the tendancy to deliver one liners every now and again, particularly after consuming his favourite food, evil souls and he makes this very clear.\n\nThe only downsides are the framerate drop which often occurs when enemies spawn into the map. This can be annoying and can break you away from the action sometimes. Plus the enemy ai can be pretty stupid when it comes to pathing, something you'll find in most painkiller titles, enemies will lose track of you easily. Also be careful with your saves. always delete the ones you don't need as the game has the tendancy to corrupt data and crash the game when too many sames are accumilated. One level in particular, Animal Farm has an awful save glitch which can corrupt data randomly on that level, basically you're required to beat it all in one sitting with no deaths as i guarrentee 80% of the time, the checkpoint autosaves will get corrupted, if you want to get the tarot card on that level, i strongly reccommend playing it on daydream to save yourself the frustration of dying and having to return to the beginning of the level.\n\nOther than that, this game is worth picking up if you are looking for a cheap old school shooter with a twist.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197983662248/recommended/3270/","76561197983662248","TechieRefugee","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197983662248/","714 products in account","To start: I used to add a much longer header to these reviews, but I've opted to keep it on my Backloggery page for the sake of brevity. Also, I had written a review for Painkiller: Black Edition, but Steam Reviews were glitchy and saying I hadn't played the game for more than five minutes (which I had played MUCH more than), so I just uploaded that review to PasteBin. Here's the last bit of the URL; you should know what to do with it: yyxEHtWB\n\nGameplay: Since this game is an expansion, I'll be writing the gameplay section assuming you've read the prior review or know what Painkiller is all about, as things really haven't changed too terribly much. However, saying that nothing has changed is a disservice, honestly. There are a lot of "carry-over" weapons, such as the Shotgun/Freeze Ray and the Rocket Launcher/Chaingun, but there are a lot of weapons that were either tweaked to make them more fun or were changed for the most part, such as the ever-unloved Stakegun being changed to a toxic waste launcher and the crossbow sniper having the alt-fire of the Stakegun. You've also got grenades which pretty much for me became the "I'm out of rockets, so here's another source of boom." The titular Painkiller has been changed to a Razor Cube, but it's still functionally the same.\n\nAs far as the enemies go, there's still quite the variety. When the game introduced as much stuff as it did in Chapter 1, I was afraid that it was gonna spend itself too quickly. Fortunately, this wasn't the case. Most of these enemies are pretty fun to fight, but some of them are just plain obnoxious. Pretty much par for the course for the Painkiller series, though. The boss fights aren't nearly as cool as the boss fights from the original, and DEFINITELY not as cool as Battle Out of Hell's boss. In fact, the first boss is pretty much a throwaway one, as it is literally just a really big version of an enemy from the first level. The second one is pretty neat, but the third one isn't really all that good. Again, it's like the Battle Out of Hell boss in that you've gotta wait to be able to attack it, but unlike in BOoH, you can't influence the boss becoming vulnerable. It's just a matter of waiting around for the boss to make itself vulnerable.\n\nSomebody made the comparison to Rise of the Triad (presumably ROTT '95 and not ROTT '13, 'cuz ROTT '13 owned) in the review section, and I really think that's the most apt comparison you can make. Chapter 1 in terms of stage design is pretty great, Chapter 2 is somewhat less great but still pretty alright, Chapter 3 becomes the point where you're saying, "I just want this game to be over with." If Chapter 1 were released shareware, I'd say go get that. However, I still overall had a pretty good time with this game, even if my enjoyment declined over the span of the game for various reasons. If you're a fan of the original Painkiller and you just want more, I'd say you'd be alright with getting this. 7/10.\n\nStory: Basically, Belial be belligerant toward Samael (and yes, that was a forced alliteration). Fortunately, the cutscenes don't crash the game this time around. However, I skipped them due to lack of interest as the story really isn't very good. Honestly, these games shouldn't even have a story. Just make it a bunch of levels. Since the game did try and have a story, though, I'll talk about it. As for the dialogue, it gets REALLY tiresome. Basically, Belial tries to be Duke Nukem and make "witty" one liners all the time. To paraphrase one of Claptrap's lines from Poker Night 2, "SHUT THE FSCK UP, BELIAL! Sheesh, and people say I'm annoying!" 5/10.\n\nGraphics: Fortunately, the art design is still as fantastic as the original's. Enemies look really awesome, the stages are usually pretty huge, and the game overall just looks like every metal video ever. Just the way it should be. Fortunately, the weird screen shake glitch didn't happen like it did in the original. I still turned it off, as it really was just more annoying than anything else. As for the technical side of things, this game does require a bit of juice to get going, but as long as you've got what the recommended card is on the Steam page, you should be just fine. I didn't really experience any graphical glitches, although there was some portions of 2-5 that caused a considerable amount of lag for no reason whatsoever. This was only a two or three minute stretch of the game, so I'd consider it inconsequential. Overall, this game still manages to hold the high standard that one would expect from Painkiller's graphical capabilities. It's definitely a game that'll still look pretty awesome in five or ten years time. 5/5.\n\nSound: This game has a real big issue with peak limiting. Like seriously, it got so bad at times that I had to turn off the game audio, as it was hurting my ears. I don't know why, though. 3-5 was the biggest culprit of this issue, so be warned. Anyways, the soundtrack is a bit... different this time around. Rather than going SO METAL, the composer decided to branch out a little bit. In fact, there really isn't any metal tracks in the game at all, save for the one from the repeat level from BOoH (oh yeah, did I mention this game lifts a level from BOoH?). While the change is nice, it runs the risk of being forgettable and not necessarily conducive to what's going on in the game. And to be honest, I really can't remember a single song from this game, whereas in the original, the songs may have gotten tired after a while, but there's a lot of memorable riffs in there. It's not a soundtrack I'd get for myself. As for the voice acting, again the main issue is the dialogue the one VA has to work with, so it's a bit tricky for me to pass judgement on the quality of the VAs. However, what I can pass judgement on are the audio engine and the soundtrack, which are both honestly pretty disappointing. 2/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 7/5/5/2; cumulative score of 6.3/10. It's not something I'd see myself replaying too terribly often, but I don't feel bad about spending my time playing it, either. If you like Painkiller, you might like this. You've probably already got the Painkiller Pack that goes on sale quite often, so you might as well dive in. It's better than a lot of modern shooters, that's for sure.","August 7, 2014","true","5.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It oscilates between stupidly easy, and stupidly difficult. The monster design is not at all thought out like the previous games.  There are giant enemies who you shoot once with anything and they have to go into a 2 second yelp animation where they are completely helpless and basically stun-locked by any weapon you choose. Then there are several enemies who go invisible and then pop out of invisibility right next to you while doing damage.  This makes no sense. There is no tracking the enemy or countering this. They just do it and you have to hope you're beefy enough to soak the damage. Where as in previous games you could dodge, plan your movement and with skill avoid your enemies, now theres just too many enemies who auto- hit no matter what you do.\n\nTerrible design flaws in game play make this a 4/10 game.","December 18, 2015","false","13.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

And yet somehow, despite living in a cage, he knows movie references.\n\nI have nary an idea, so let's move on.\n\nIf you thought the original Painkiller was tough with it's hordes of enemies and some puzzle bosses, you'll be happy to know that there's not as much enemies to deal with and puzzle bosses aren't as frequent, and much easier to work with. The core principle of PK: OD is the same.\n\nBlast they demon asses and kill the main bad dude at the end, this time being Sammael.\n\nBelial's got some good firepower, like the Bone Shotgun from the original game, the crossbow/bomb launcher from Battle out of Hell, the Minigun/Rocket Launcher from the first game... yeah, there's a lot of returning weapons with reskins, but there are new weapons to work with like the Demon Head you get in the beginning of the gaqme that shoots lasers, Demon Eggs that work like remote sticky bombs, A dagger that can be shot out and float in place and eviscerate enemies.\n\nSadly, there's no weapon that shoots shurikens and lightning, for shame. :(\n\nAlong the way, Belial will face many enemies, some new like preachers that resurrect dead foes, Ladies with propellors for arms, plus some returning foes like the kids on fire from Battle out of hell, the puppets from battle out of hell...\n\nI'm beginning to notice a theme here... things being reused from the first Painkiller and it's expansion pack. Hell, even the theme park level is ripped from Battle out of hell, just with a different final part. Laziness is a sin.\n\nAnd like in the last Painkiller, if you want to get the tarot cards, prepare to deal with some BS requirements along the way, like not picking up souls, so you can't transform into a demon. Or collecting all the souls in a level, only for an enemy to be glitched out, leaving you one soul shy. :P\n\nHowever, despite all the issues, I will still heartily recommend Painkiller Overdose. It may not be the prettiest girl on the dance floor and she might have some issues, but if you have patience and are willing to see what Painkiller's like without any puzzle bosses, then give Overdose a chance. It's not much on Steam and it's pretty short.\n\nJust be careful of chicks with propellors, they're fast and they love nephilim ♥♥♥.

Compare it to games like Serious Sam or Duke Nukem, who both had enemies that were distinctly different from each other and easily displayed what sort of attacks they had. Instead, the obsession with having unique enemies for practically every level leads to boring and indistinct variations of "brown and grey spoopy thing" that often have attacks that aren't readily apparent. Also, most of the enemies with guns are hitscan. Combine this with level design that often borderlines on claustrophobic and you've got a game that falls flat on its face as a horde shooter.\n\nThe main game is slightly better than the expansion; some of the levels are actually nicely designed, and you aren't being peppered with the same 5 one-liners every 2 minutes, but it still suffers from the awful enemy design. If you do get any Painkiller game, get Black Edition and stop there.","February 6, 2014","false","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
