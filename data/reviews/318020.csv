But it’s rough around the edges and I’ll be highlighting some things that you won’t learn from reviews/watching streams but that might get your goat once you sit down and play. This is aimed at more avid RTS gamers wondering whether AoA is their kinda thing or not.\n\nComparisons:\nYeah, this is a mere license short of Act of War 2. Eugen’s Wargame sensibilities show in the map sizes and road mechanics, and there’s rolling economy and superweapon/anti-superweapon from SupCom, but that’s where the comparisons end. Whilst not really bringing much new to the genre AoA manages to smartly combine existing ideas into a surprisingly novel RTS.\n\nBase Building:\nStarting up anyone will find it easy and intuitive to just start plopping buildings down, but as you learn more and get better you’ll realize just how much room for optimization and intelligent base building this game provides. Some buildings have very restrictive placement requirements, other have none. Some explode terribly when destroyed. The placement of air control centers affect the trajectories your aircraft will use. There are buildings dedicated to optimizing your economy. Tons of depth and it’s never mundane.\n\nEconomy:\nThree harvestable resources plus power for your base are what you’ll be managing game to game.\n\nThe economies being asymmetrical is a huge factor in what makes each faction unique, rather than how other RTS games emphasize units and production mechanics. Each of the factions will harvest resources at different rates for different investments and so even harassing economies will vary in efficacy between factions and the mind boggles at the math involved.\n\nThe rolling economy setup means there’s a lot of room for optimization at the top level but it’s still friendly to new players. It’s an extremely exciting game from a management perspective and the best players right now are not only very technical players but they’re very intelligent managers.\n\nUnits:\nThis is where things are hit-and-miss right now.\n\nStarting with the bad: right now (patch .515) we still have an arbitrary delay on units responding to your orders, which makes micro frustrating. This along with generally sluggish and wonky unit behaviour can make the game really frustrating to play, especially when you’re doing the kind of razor-thin builds the game otherwise encourages. That said, the developers are in communication with some of the high level players and that’s encouraging.\n\nOn to the good: this is no Grey Goo unit roster. High level play right now is sees a lot of combined arms comps and often builds will squeeze in specialized units for specific problems. Cartel and US will squeeze sniper units into their builds to clear banks and urban areas; there’s the ADS, the coolest unit in the game, which does no direct damage but is able to blind and slow units within a certain distance; Scout CSGs can get flamethrowers to instantly clear buildings; Superhinds can drop napalm bombs on enemies. Lots of interesting units and interesting interactions, and if Eugen balance correctly this won’t be a game of the highest DPS/HP army winning but an extremely technical game of real time chess.\n\nFlow/Pacing:\nThis is probably the weirdest part of the game. It’s very comfortable to get into but as you get better there’s a lot of subtlety to internalize. Like your economy ramps up through the course of the game and it’s different for each faction. The maps and the road mechanic can also make it really hard to try and predict army movement.\n\nAoA de-emphasizes rigid build orders and attempts to reward adaptation and improvisation. It isn’t only down to the random resource spawning: with production times being much shorter and r/p/s mechanics being harsh in a C&C kind of way it’s often necessary to change your game plan. Aggressive tech switching is amazing in this game.\n\nEarly game is a tad stale if you come from say Starcraft, but newcomers should find it comfortable without being bored – even early game there’s a lot to do.\n\nMidgame gets a little more interesting but it also often has players just massing enough units to not die. Because you don’t have a supply mechanic, players can actually dedicate 100% of their resources to units, and playing vs a spammer is something to be aware of. It also makes potential all-ins harder to write-off as they don’t necessarily hit inside a certain time frame. That said, due to the way tech gets unlocked – you often unlock a lot of units at once – you’re not locked into going for a certain composition or style, and even in the midgame it feels like there are a ton of tools at your disposal and your job is to pick the right ones and use them well.\n\nLate game is where all the spice is as many of the more interesting stuff gets unlocked in this phase and players are more willing to dedicate resources to them. Is your opponent going for air control? Surely he’ll be able to scout your SW rush? But then will he even be able to mine enough RE to get up the adequate anti-SW defense? Can you deny his mining with your low-tech army or should you resort to more underhanded tactics? The variables once again boggle the mind and here intelligent, responsive play can easily beat out mindless amassing of units.\n\nThere’s also a lot of leeway for different styles at this stage. Are you the sure-and-steady steamroller? You’re covered. Responsive player? Scouting’s ace in this game. Like playing frantic high APM games? AoA loves multi-tasking. Do you like technical play, creating intricate game plans and then pulling off everything with precision? Quit your dayjob already! It’s very refreshing from the figured-out by-the-numbers metagames of many other RTS games.\n\nCaveat Emptor:\nWe’ve all been burned by new RTS games so I want to highlight some issues with the game that might not be obvious if you’re watching streams but might royally ♥♥♥♥ you off once you’ve sit down to play. Most of these have some kind of chance of being fixed.\n\nScant options for rebinding hotkeys. By hook or by crook, this will almost surely be addressed in some kind of way but this is the worst hotkey setup of any RTS I’ve ever played and it’s not very customizable.\nUnit response delay/wonky behaviours. If controlling units is your favourite part of an RTS, wait till this gets fixed for sure!\nClarity over atmosphere/presentation. Deciphering what’s going on feels supremely hard in this game, and even telling the different buildings apart takes a while.\nThis game really is on the buggy side. It’s mostly inoffensive but there’s a lot of polish work to be done here.\nEugen have really been too quick and too harsh with some of their balance patches, when I feel they should allow players more time to figure out the game.\nNo Map Editor right now. Maybe later?\nCampaign is meh and the AI is wank, so if you’re all about the solo RTS then you might want to wait for some DLCs, an expansion and a summer sale before picking this up.\nFor a more comprehensive list of issues, there’s a list of commonly requested features and improvements by the community[forums.eugensystems.com] on Eugens forums.\n\nThat said:\nThis is a legitimately exciting RTS. It’s undercooked right now but what’s here is too good for me give up on. Already this game can be excluded from the drivel us RTS players have been proffered over the last few years. If Eugen’s post-release support is good (it supposedly has been for Wargame) then it will live up to its potential, but if you’re on the fence about this game then you should probably wait and see. Me? I'm having so much fun playing this game.","September 4, 2015","true","168.7"," 614 of 677 people (91%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","91","614","677","24","27"

I simply love traditional RTS games.  By traditional I am referring to the resource, build, produce sub-genre of RTS made very popular by the C&C franchise.\n\nGrey Goo let me down and simply could not entice an audience.  Etherium was low quality.\n\nFInally I feel like someone has made an RTS game worthy to be held up against C&C Generals; one of my favorite and most well-love RTS games of this sub-genre.\n\nAct of Aggression is faithful to the formula we all love to a T.  There is economical ramp up, bases and buildings to place and sift through tech unlocks and of course lots of awesome tanks to build and roll over you opponent with...as well as infantry, air and other support units.\n\nThis is one of the most deep RTS titles I have ever played.  There is a lot to do and a lot to learn.  That fact is however a bit of a double edged sword.  For those willing to sink in lots of hours you will find tremendous replayability and depth, otherwise you might get frustrated and walk away before you get to the big payoff.\n\nIf you love RTS games and miss C&C this is 100% a game you want to engage with and spend some time learning the nuances of.  I am strictly a PvP guy so for me the SP campaign means very little.  I have been in the early access beta and have about 50 hours in 1v1 and 2v2 PvP play, so take my comments based on that fact.\n\nThere are three very distinct sides, US, Cartel and Chimera.  The US seems to be the most vanilla, traditional RTS side, Chimera is very unique in how you expand and unlock tech and the Cartel will probably be the most played side providing ambush, stealth and futuristic weaponary as a staple of game play.  I prefer the Chimera and their spider basing expanding style.\n\nI won't get into the game play much other than to say once you learn the system and there is a lot to learn you will find yourself enjoying a true RTS game without any pay items or progression breaking mechanisms.  The game is session based and each match is played fairly on even terms, everyone starts back at zero each match, no permanane tunlocks or anything like that.\n\nThe big difference (other than the amazing graphics and audio and other special effects) this game has when compared to Generals, per say, is the scale.  Maps are much larger, and while this is very different games still play in the same pace, a well played evenly matched 1v1 game averages around 20 minutes.  The map scale is big but the pace is excellent, which actually creates a little more breathing room as you can't effectively rush a player early (you sort of can using some off the wall collector rushes and such) but overall the game plays out less tense because of the shear map size.  Attacks need to be well thought out and territory grabbing becomes more important than simply rushing.\n\n\nI hope this review helps.  This is a great old fashioned through back to the glory days of RTS will new and awesome looking units that feel very powerful when you begin to unlock all of the upgrades at your fingertips.\n\nI will add one last note.  While there are many options to build off map units to call in for devestating strikes along with super weapon nukes and such, you won't see those come into play very often in competitive matches, but they are fun to mess with in skirmishes or in large team games that are stale mating.  Other than that, which unfortunately some of the off map call-ins feel very cheesy and spamable, you will find a very faithful C&C Generals like experience played out on a larger scale with less rushing, but far more intense fighting.\n\n","September 3, 2015","true","157.2"," 212 of 254 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","212","254","6","0"

If its only a couple of hours, remember that this guy probably typed his review frustrated after a certain loss or that he didnt gave the chance to actually get deep into this game.\n\nThis game has every C&C fan waiting for. As I played all the C&C games and am a big RTS fan, this game has got me completely.\nIt is hard in the beginning as it is familiar but also makes you think a bit differently and you need some time to learn and adapt to this RTS.\nPlease do so as it is a gem that will hook you up completely and drag you into the feeling of : more more more !!!\n\nThe graphics are eyecandy, and for the tacticians there is the satelite view wich let you look high above the map like a radar grid, but wich makes it very clearly tacticwise.\nThe units are decent thought out and the time to react & counter to enemy units is fair.\nfor example, at one point i saw planes coming over and lost 2 buildings, i didnt know he had air and i didnt builded AA. the time in between the two bombing runs i quickly made AA infantry, made a stealth spotter recon vehicle to detect them and 2 AA vehicles. Next run he lost few planes and he needed to adapt so he tried coming in from the other side, luckily I had spotted him for a nano sec as he flew past a unit from the east and I made  my units going to the east and could took a few out aswell.\n\nIt is very adrenaline, rewarding game that every RTS fan should try !!!

It took both parts from all three series and then mixes it together. It took some of CnC's arcady massive army, single unit aspect of the game, then add in Wargame's realism, and the result if this weird not so smooth gameplay. This game has a lot of promise, but the delivery felt kind of disappointing to be honest.\n\nPros\n-this game has some of the most detailed animation/model in the RTS genre, with stunning visual to behold.\n\n-Absolutely massive amount of diverse unit types, each does multiple roles very well, making this combined army feel some of the other RTS games failed to deliver. It has jumped away from this "one unit counters another" loop.\n\n-Each faction is special and much to its own. All 3 have their own character and promoting different type of play style.\n\nCons\n-Due to the number of different units per faction, and the tech-tree/structure layout making this game a hell of a mess for beginners. The upgrades for the units are all over the place, and the units don’t have very well defined roles.\nFor example, the Cartel faction can "upgrade" their intro artillery unit into anti-tank role, but decrease all other damage drastically, or upgrading stealth recon transports with flamethrowers that breaks its stealth. Some of the designs seems messy at the least and conflicting at the worst.\n\n-The logistic is messy, as you need to control a wide spread of map in order to able to keep up with the logistic demands. The resource points spread around the map randomly and can't be harvested BEFORE you build a pretty useless scout unit to scope it out first, but all of the resource points require a drop point, and Alu and RE resources also requires storage to store the excess amount of resources.\nMeaning you will be spending a fairly huge amount of time trying to expand your economy by building refineries all over the map, build drop points for the said refinery, then proceed to dump valuable resource trying to protect the weak refinery/drop sites.\nAlso, the resource gathers are easy targets for hostile’s forces, and they won’t be replaced automatically. This is causing the game to be too micro focused, and spreading your attention thin to multiple places at once. As you need to keep an eye on each of the refineries as how much resource is left, if the resource gathers are destroyed by the hostile forces and reassign the excess resource gathers.\n\n-Unnecessary realism in arcady settings. This is also my biggest beef with this game. The devs are trying to make a fast paced RTS games like CnC Generals, Red Alert, etc but also wanted to add in a little realism that seems to be no place for a game like this like the friendly fire for your own troops (No, I’m not talking about artillery units).\nFor example, if your own Anti-tank missile landed too close to your units, it will damage and destroy your own units as well. Or as the Cartel defensive turret will destroy everything around it when it's destroyed (even the aerial units). This is causing a huge problem for me, and harming the gameplay in the process. I often lose more units to my own collateral damage and chain reactions(such as a single destroyed turret destroys half of my base) than the enemy fire.\n\n-Unnecessary realism part 2. Some of the units have fairly long reload time, such as AT infantries. Also the enemy fire can damage and kill garrisoned units. These two factors combined with the poor targeting AI creates a huge amount of problem for the gameplay, as units will all fire on first enemy in sight. It's pretty common to see your massive force all fire on one single unit and then take unnecessary damages.\n\n-Unit control is sloppy. This game adapts the Wargame's "road system". Which means all of your vehicles will choose to use roads if ordered to move a long stretch of space. However, the pathfinding in this game is unpredictable.\nMore often than not you will see your massive attacking force be split to multiple smaller groups all driving different routes to your target, getting taking out one by one on their way there, and there's no way to keep formation. This combined with units blocking each other making the unit control for large armies one hell of a mess.\nThis combined with all of the above makes your units squashy, and expansive. Most of mid level players find themselves run out of any resources by the late game, and the game ends in this sluggish paced grindfest because the assulting units are all too squashy. You can't have this satisfying murder ball experience you get from CnC or Starcraft.\n\nI was hoping this game can revive my RTS spirit like the RTS golden age did, but the delivery fell short and the game feels just mediocre at best. Lots of questionable design decisions making this game not very enjoyable for me. This game feels like it doesn't really know what it wants to be. It's neither Wargame realistic, strategic and slow paced promoting a careful approach, nor CnC's arcady, quick, ball of death simple gameplay. More like a kid who wants to practice art in a law firm.","September 21, 2015","false","36.1"," 276 of 405 people (68%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","68","276","405","17","1"

The camera and new satelite mode is both smooth to switch between and both has it´s benefits. You will rarely see a game with this much details into the fine smaller items/units which truely makes the game great.\n\nMultiplayer is in fact surprising optimized, I´m still using my mobile broadband and have no issues playing with anyone, I rarely see a DC or a network crash even tho I´ve played with people across the world and that is truely rare in this day of age. The multiplayer is as balanced as a RTS can be and there is always a counter to every unit which makes even the tier 1 units valuable in MP.\n\nAll in all this is the best RTS I´ve played for a long long time and also in the top 5 of best RTS`s I´ve ever played, as said only thing I would have liked is more singleplayer missions however knowing Eugen Systems we are gonna get a lot of nice updates for free ^_^\n\nSo if you like RTS, specially C&C Generals or Red Alert 2 this is a MUST HAVE for your collection in every aspect.\n\n","September 12, 2015","true","178.3"," 101 of 141 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","101","141","5","9"

This is the RTS that this genre has been needing for years, technological upgrades, extensive building options, lots of units with factions that are extremely varied. And the good old gamebreaking nukes you get at the end of the game... this most certainly shows that the genre is not dead and still has economic viability. And don't worry, this game isn't a carbon copy rock-paper-scissors game. While yes, certain units are better at bringing down certain units, infantry are equipped to bring down other infantry, vehicles and aircraft, just as the other types can bring down infantry as well.

Sometimes I'm just to tired to get into a game against humans and all I want is to play a few rounds with friends. This game delivers exactly that.\n- I really enjoy the way this game approaches it's take on RTS. The resource mechanic feels challanging but not unfair (a few matches forced me to expand more than I wanted because the #%$! rare earth was quite a bit away from my base. I like the prisoner mechanic, sure, you need a some micro management for that but the reward for that effort is worth it. The airstrikes feel like skillshots from MOBAs (which I also enjoy) and added a rewarding gameplay mechanic (shooting hostile bombers down RIGHT before your base just makes my day!).\n- One of my favorite RTS games is Supreme Commander, always loved it's complexity. I was really disappointed when Supreme Commander 2 was kinda "dumbed down" to be more accessible. Still enjoyed the game. Act of Aggression feels like it didn't went for those compromises (sure, they certainly made some) and I can dig in stats and rich unit diversity.\n- Reliable netcode: This one is easy. I never finished a multiplayer game C&C Generals with the infantry general. Ever. When i picked up C&C 3 about 1/5 multipalyer games disconnected because of the netcode (I played friends, we used voice chat, so there were no issues on provider side). This shouldn't be a plus, it should be a given for every game that has multiplayer. Shame it isn't.\n\nI am honestly surprised about how many negative reviews there are. Maybe others expected something different from this game. I did not. It delivered what I felt it promiesd. Sure, the singleplayer lacks cutscenes. And balancing needs some tweaking (I mostly play Chimera). I can live with that.\n\nSo, in a nutshell: I am 33, my first RTS was Dune, played all kinds of RTS, even the weird ones like War Wind and I can recommend this game without a doubt. Is it perfect? Well, obviously not. Still a bloody fun game.","October 20, 2015","true","98.5"," 65 of 88 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","65","88","3","2"

In concept its a fine game, the skirmish works good and the gameplay feels solid and fun. It puts you in mind of the old 90s style RTS which is a good thing if you grew up on them like I did. Multiplayer is almost dead unfortunantly with only maybe a hundred on at a time but is rather nice when you can get into a match. My biggest gripe about the game has to be the single player campaigns. The voice acting is atrocious, campaign missions don't have much of a plot or point in my opinion, and in a lot of missions it feels like they perpously set you up for failure and make it to where some missions have to be played 2-3 times or more before you can actually get well enough off to beat them. The real question is does it stand up to those it is trying to live up to such as C&C 3 and Red Alert 3, and sadly the answer is no. Its a fun game with great potential and I would recomend it to anyone just itching for a classic feeling RTS, but for anyone who is unfamiliar with the genre don't buy it. You'll be waisting your  money. As far as final verdict its probably only a 6/10 at the most feeling generous. It's not terrible but deffinitly needs improved upon.","February 18","false","15.4"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","23","26","0","2"

Many of the units even have the same name. There is again a US Army which (again) deploys Marines for some strange reason. The Sryker is now a US Army unit and lacks upgrades, but the Humvee now has upgrades for TOW missiles, a machine gun, or Mortar. The Stinger soldier is now US Army. The basic marine has a LMG upgrade instead of the grenade launcher. So pretty much just a remix of the old units.\n\nYou need to set up refineries to collect oil, and put troops in building to steal cash. There is a defcon 2 and 1 you need to research before you get better buildings and units.\n\nSome small differences, they added metal and rare earth elements as additional resources. You put up buildings directly from the HQ (they send out a little constructor after a couple seconds), you need power as before, but its measured in single units rather than 100 megawatts at a time.\nThere are more upgrades, and many of them come from a traditional Armory building, which of course has prerequisite buildings.\n\nYou can zoom much further out in normal mode, and there is a satelite view mode almost as good as the tactical map mode in Supreme Commander.\n\nThe base game loads a little slower, but once you are in the game loading up skirmishes and campaigns is almost instant, which is very convenient. Graphics are almost exactly the same as Act of War but with more advanced shaders, ambient occlusion, and some other modern effects. The sound track is a faster paced, techno-rock style deal. And it plays continuously as you move from the menu to a skirmish. Theres a few more audio controls, nothing major.\n\nAI is pretty good. Even on Very Easy it puts up a halfway decent fight. Theres a few more options for skirmishes, but nothing special. You can now use WASD to move the camera around. Many commands are issued with Q, E, and R.\n\nOverall its really just a small upgrade from Act of War. If you loved the first game and its expansion, you will love this.\n\nIf you didnt like Act of War at all, theres nothing here to change your mind.","September 2, 2015","true","5.2"," 51 of 75 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","51","75","0","4"

A small force can’t demolish a base or garrisoned buildings in seconds.\nGarrisoning is a strong ability in the game.\nScouting is done well.\nAi seems good so far.\nMaps aren’t too small.\nCamera can zoom out to the entire battlefield.\n\nCons;\n\nLacking in controls / key bindings:  I kept looking in the options menu to find key bindings for options that simply didn’t exist, such as select all units on the map (not just the screen)\nCamera control is missing the ability to use a mouse (hold) button to move the camera.  If it’s not a default there should be an option to allow it.  Pushing the screen edges is slow and annoying, using WASD takes your left hand away from what it should be doing in an RTS…using the keyboard for hundreds of other shortcuts.\nThe tech tree is a mess.  Upgrades are spread out in too many building sub-menus and there’s no overall clear picture of what has been upgraded, what you can upgrade next or what is required to upgrade.  A simple SupCom style upgrade screen would be ideal.\nThe build menus are cumbersome to use.  Structures are organized by tech level instead of by function.  Tabs for defenses, resources, vehicles, infantry, tech etc. would have been much easier to use.\nDefenses seem almost irrelevant.   No wall building, very limited Anti-ground vehicle & infantry defenses.\nThere’s no way to select all units and have them show on a menu or sub-menu.  So if you are looking for a unit that you know is out there somewhere you have to physically search the whole map for it.\nNo tutorial.\nNo capturable structures other than banks\nNo dual monitor support.  In an RTS a using second monitor for the mini-map is a really nice option.  Dual monitors have been common for a long time now!\nNo custom camera memory options (i.e. to quickly set camera positions for custom areas of the map and then hit a button to go there)\nNo guard / follow option for units such as repair unit.\nNo patrol options.  Especially helpful for repair units / air units / stealth detection units.\nNo fighter jets / bombers except for off screen airstrikes.\nNo unit waypoint visualizations.\nUnits view distance doesn’t match fire distance. (Artillery should require spotters / drones or something to explain their ability to aim blind)\nNo formation options (such as hold both mouse buttons and drag for options).\nThe game is unintuitive when build queues stop for whatever reason.\nThere are too many vehicles that look the same and confuse the battlefield.\nToo many structures that seem ambiguous and unnecessary.\nThe drone camera view is cool but not fully exploited.  It should be an unlock and possibly provide more data or have more upgrade options.\nThere are very few tactical strike options that can surprise an enemy beyond the bombing ability.  So everything is about the main attack force.  No commando style drops or researched abilities to help turn the tide, or ways to promote more clandestine tactics.\nNo aggressive neutral factions in the game.  No random weather or tectonic events (not essential in an RTS but it makes things more immersive and varied)\n\nOVERALL\n\nI feel that this game has the potential to be really good but it has been let down by being rushed to market or just a lack of overall vision.\n\nIf you're a casual RTS gamer you'll probably be ok with this game.  If however you regularly play RTS games then this one will likely disappoint.\n\nI really wanted to like this game but I’ll be playing modded CNC3: Tiberium Wars & Generals: Zero Hour and SupCom until something better comes along.","September 5, 2015","false","5.8"," 170 of 288 people (59%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","59","170","288","8","21"

The single player campaign doesn't really acknowledge it and can leave one quite puzzled and sore, and barely acts as a turorial. The UI could be better and maybe there are some specific commands you'll miss from others games. There are many units and upgrades and understanding what you can do with a specific faction can be a daunting task. One tends to play the game zoomed out and units/vehicles/buildings can be difficult to tell apart. All considered the game requires quite a knowledge base to be enjoyable.\n\nSo my advice would be to go on SKIRMISH right away. There are 5 AI difficulty levels, the lowest being very gentle. Take your time and discover each faction tech tree at your own pace.\n\nNow what features are quite specific to Act of Aggression.\n3 resources + power. They work like the mineral/gaz combo from starcraft : some upgrades and units will lean rather toward one resource or the other so you'll have to either plan accordingly or know what to buy when your income is unbalanced. Now something VERY IMPORTANT : you pay only while something is being produced, not right away like in other games. There is a specific missing resource icon showing up on buildings that can't provide your order due to missing elements, so check on them and don't panic. Consider removing a queued command that is stalling your production.\n\nThe game has a fair pacing. Hard counters can kill quickly, but overall the map size gives time to plan and react to events, and swarms can be punished with entreched infantry and area of effect weapons. Defenses can be quite strong, and infantry is essential in urbanized areas.\nDowned units can leave wounded and pilots to be captured by enemy infantry, and they provide both immediate and long term income. So don't be a fool and give them to your opponent on a plate, or be a prick and fire on your own downed men if you feel that way XD. you can heal up your wounded infantry or extract your pilots, both giving you savings and avoiding their capture.\n\nA quick feedback on the 3 factions :\nU.S. is the more user friendly. Specialized units, rather solid armor, and very powerful end tier artillery and bombers. U.S. player can put their defenses wherever they please and setup quite solid defensive position with their powerful infantry. Their armor is cheap on aluminium.\n\nCartel : powerful and single resource type infantry, with insane range once upgraded. Can build their barracks in any place. Late game they have access to a really wide range of stealth units. Those have a first shot bonus when attacking unsuspecting victims. Their vehicles are quite fragile so excert caution\n\nChimaera : choices can feel quite limited in early game but the more they tech up, the more omnipotent their units become. You can turn many units into anti tank/ anti air / anti missile combo, they have some powerful upgraded infantry in end game. Their pricing is quite different from their counterparts as many units can cost a lot of a single resources instead of a mix of them. Have overall the best recon units in the game.\n\nA final word about the graphics. The game is often played zoomed out and this can be quite disappointing. The game itself is beautiful but let's be honest, infantry and smaller vehicles can be difficult to tell apart. That said, late game stages can be quite terrific, with powerful artillery and missiles barrages countered by vulcan defenses etc. These moments are quite the reward for the dedicated player.\n\nConclusion : the game doesn't provide a smooth experience at first glance. It's not as rough as the WARGAME serie can be, but you have there is quite a burden of knowledge attached to it. Once you get used to playing the factions, you'll be reap the reward, by staging successful ambushes, frantically defending a besieged city or covering large areas in ordinance.","September 12, 2015","true","46.8"," 35 of 52 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","35","52","0","0"

The standard gameplay revolves around building a base, controlling resources and producing units. It is not unlike the Command and Conquer series. Three factions—Chimera, Cartel and US—are just different enough to make it interesting. For example, the Cartel faction has awesome stealth tanks while the US army rolls through with field-upgradable Abrams.\n\nThere are 15 single player missions, mostly involving the Chimera faction, but the story is in complete shambles with awful briefings. It never explains the essentials or contextualises the missions well enough. Fortunately the mission design is quite good although far too difficult near the end, especially when there is no difficulty or game speed option. You’ll be protecting cargo trucks or taking over friendly bases—it offers quite good variety for a traditional RTS game.\n\nSkirmish against AI is decent. They can be erratic from one game to the next, and resource nodes change position to keep you on your toes. Multiplayer worked fairly well even against people from around the globe, with only slight delays when issuing orders. Micromanagement aspects do get a bit tiring, like capturing enemy soldiers or preventing your tanks from driving through an ambush—they love travelling on roads. It does not have a great many players online though.\n\nIt looks great and has no problems rendering hundreds of units engaged in battle. The camera provides a close or far view of the action and can be fully rotated. Units, especially the ground vehicles, and the environments look great. It has lots of cool detail within the maps, like civilian structures or farming equipment. There are some minor navigation issues around destroyed vehicles, and the interface could be better. Despite its issues, Act of Aggression is a rewarding strategy experience that provides a healthy flashback to earlier RTS games.\n\nRead my longer Review[www.newgamenetwork.com]","September 19, 2015","true","38.3"," 29 of 44 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","29","44","0","1"

Airplane and superweapon controls improved significantly over Act of War.\n\nCons -\nSome balance issues. Combined with randomised placement of resources, a faction can lose steam easily at certain points of the game. In conjunction with this, the flexible gameplay mentioned above is mitigated by the fact that without following a very specific build and tech tree order, you can find your resources running out and your factions losing momentum easily.\nVery lacklustre story, especially in light of how story-heavy and atmospheric Act of War was.\nVery lacklustre voice acting. Sometimes it is funny enough to be tolerable (the recon helicopters just sound so excited when they find oil) but usually just grating.\nKey bindings limited and squad hotkeys prone to getting reset.\n\nMixed -\n\nMusic is 50/50. Most of it is from free music sites and this was noticable even before I actually looked it up. That said, the picks are good and generally fit the vibe of the game. However, the selection is small and gets repetative. Understandable given the budget constraints.\nThe campaign in HARD. Occasionally frustratingly so. Whether that is a plus or minus depends on how good you are and how much you enjoy such a difficulty curve.\nHad a fairly decent community at the start. Lots of discussions about RTS games and so on and but was a bit toxic over time. Lots of racist posts spammers for some reason (Moreso than usual. These weren't 13 year olds shouting n****r for giggles but full on racist-political posts and arguments). Not the game's fault but the fact that the community chat was integrated into the game means that unless you opted out of logging into the game's online features, it was something constantly in your face and spoiled the fun a bit. Nothing that the developers could do but still bugged me.\n\nI am recommending the game because at its core, it is a good game and with a bit more polish, could've become a great and memorable experience. You can tell a lot of love went into making this game and it is a bit sad to see the review average is Mixed. However, it has its flaws and there are quite a few lessons to learn if a worthy successor is to be made.","February 2","true","44.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

You can't hold down right click or the middle mouse button so you're stuck to using the keyboard unless you want to use edge scrolling. This seems like a pretty bizzare oversight since I can't remember the last RTS I played where this wasn't a feature.\n\nNext up is the camera zoom. The satellite view just feels incredibly clunky. Going from the normal view to the satellite view feels like you're fighting with the scroll wheel. I've seen this feature praised by some and I have no idea why. If the transition was smoother perhaps I'd enjoy it more, but at the moment it just seems jarring to go from the regular RTS view to a weird satellite view.\n\nOne of the most important parts of an RTS is being able to tell the enemies army at a glance. Well, I had trouble identifying what the hell I had in my own army and I was the one that built the bloody thing. Not only this, but even FINDING your own units is a challenge because they blend into the maps so easily and have no easy identifiers.\n\nAll the units look very familiar. It's almost impossible to tell if a building is garrisoned until it's too late. In Starcraft it's incredibly easy to tell the difference between a Zealot and a Stalker. In Red Alert I can easily tell the difference between a V3 rocket and a tank, even the infantry are pretty easy to tell apart from their sillouhettes. In AoA I've just got a big mix of grey blocks moving towards another big group of grey blocks. It's hard enough to tell the difference between vehicles, infantry? Forget about it.\n\nUnits die almost instantly. I had 3 commanche helicopters shot out of the sky in about .002 seconds by 2 anti-air vehicles. I'm totally fine with heavy counters, but I think it's a bit ridiculous that I couldn't even save a single unit in that situation. The fact that it feels like an eternity for your units to respond to commands doesn't help with this either. In a game like Company of Heroes I can accept my tank may take a while to turn around since the game goes for realism and it can generally surive a few shots anyway. In AoA I tell my tanks to turn around and during the time it takes for them to stop and turn they've all been one-shot killed by the enemy. You won't see any cool micro like stutter stepping with infantry or moving your damaged tanks away from the front lines since everything just explodes the moment it comes into contact with another molecule.\n\nThe upgrade system seems way too complicated for a game that's trying to be a fast paced RTS. This sort of upgrade system would feel at home in a 4X strategy game, not an arcade RTS.\n\nI'm pretty disappointed in the amount of reviews I read that claimed this RTS to be a return to the golden age of RTS or a spiritual successor to Generals. I've been a fan of the C&C series since Red Alert 1 and this doesn't feel anything like C&C OR Generals.\n\nBut lets forget about C&C for a moment and judge AoA for what it is. It's just not a great RTS in my opinion. It feels like it's struggling to find out what it wants to be. One moment it wants to be arcady and fast paced and on the other hand there's little micro and units dying instantly with no chance of even turning around thanks to the movement mechanics.\n\nUnless some pretty major changes are made to this game I'd suggest avoiding it.","September 27, 2015","false","13.9"," 56 of 98 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","56","98","3","2"

Another important point is to know where to place your refinery, the most efficient way is to place it in the middle of an specific deposit, as this will allow you to access it without need for more than one structure per deposit.\n\nFrom a campaign perspective you get a quite simple and not too ambitious history about modern military operations and world conspiracy, while sadly it seems like this part received the short end of the budget with just videologs, the missions can still enjoyable just for the sake of the challenge, I really hope Eugen Systems may improve on that point in the coming future.\n\nThe AI in this game is quite nice, don’t expect it to make exceptional movements but it can be tricky and sometimes it can outflank you and quickly expand to capitalize their economy. Also it can defend itself quite decently against early rushes and give you a challenge once it gets enough resources.\n\nOverall the game is very good, and while there are some points which are still in need of some fix Eugen Systems team have shown they care about their games, keeping them patched and even releasing “free DLC” updates which don’t cost you a cent and add new stuff to the game.\nScore: 9/10","October 22, 2015","true","212.7"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","1"

Forget that, I had whole Helicopter fleets erased in a second. Some people prefer that system, I don't because it forces a lot of unit types into support roles and if you can't win without a strong tank army then why even bother using something else.\n\nUnit variety: While each faction has their own units they look all very much the same which makes it difficult to identify them without a closer look and thanks to the upgrade system you can make them extremely versatile which takes away another piece of tactical depth because you can safely ignore a lot of units once you upgraded one or two.\n\nLook&Feel: The UI isn't very intuitive and the build icons look all very samey which makes it difficult to find what you need without looking at the tool-tip over and over again. On top of that besides the players color everything has either brown or grey tones which might not be everyones cup of tea and makes most maps look the same.\n\nOverall the game is a very level headed experience, I never had one of those "oh ♥♥♥♥ Kirovs" moments that make other RTS so brilliant nor did I ever feel particularly smart when wining a game. Get your economy right, don't try anything crazy with your unit composition and that's about it.\n\nI would recommend this game to people who love the Wargame series and are looking for a more traditional RTS with base building but I would not recommend it to people who are coming from a C&C or SC2 angle.","September 3, 2015","false","14.9"," 46 of 82 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","46","82","4","2"

By porridge, I mean that this game is just bland, boring and thick with things that you have to do in order to try to have actual fun with the game... you have to mentally chew your way through the game rather than being excited about what tech you're going to get next, or what buildings and units are going to be available to you within the next 5 minutes.\nRather than being able to mentally streamline the experience with knowing where things are on the map after a few or so games, they've given you loads of pointless map clutter that serves absolutely no purpose and 3 randomised resources which can simply ♥♥♥♥ up your entire experience - all of those hours of the RTS skill you've attained over the years are thrown out of the window due to, guess what? A randomisation mechanic within the resources... and on top of that, there's way too much tech and units for you to ever experience everything within a single game like every other RTS allows you to do. If it's not the resources running out, it's the randomised resource points not giving you enough, or it's the resources not giving you enough in general to get past DEFCON 2.\nThe tech and unit options are convoluted and each faction ends up being a complete cobweb like mess that you have to figure out but, it's the type of figuring out that will give you a migraine rather than a mental boner due to being intellectually challenged.\nOn top of that; each faction isn't really all that different. There is no real character to any of the factions, units or anything else in the game - again, it's bland, boring and quite forgettable. It takes itself way too seriously to be actually fun... you know? A 'game' is meant to be created for others to play so that they can have 'fun'.\nIf you are wanting an RTS game for multiplayer then this isn't it. You'll probably play a few matches and you'll forget what actually happened due to how much of a 'rat race' it is. It literally feels like a 9am to 5pm day job when playing this game - rather than an escape into a world of explosions and badassery...\nBase building is quite possibly the most boring aspect of the game due to it keeping you confined to a stupid grid system rather than being able to build a base and angle the buildings so that it has some sort of 'life' and believability to it - not 'realism' but, believability - it's not your base, it's the grid and game's base. Why can't I angle my buildings so that I can create interesting layouts? Why can't I build my barracks across a road when there's nothing else that's going to be using that piece of road? It's the decisions like this that hold the game back from being successful. Woe be to the person who tells the developers their opinion on the game or else you just get called a troll, and then banned - I've seen that happen to many people.\nDon't even get me started on the lack of control scheme options - if that's anything to go by then you should avoid this game like the plague because not only does it take the genre back to 'the golden age of RTS', but, it takes it back to 'the golden age of RTS' in terms of all the bad things are more so than the good things. Don't buy this game just because of that reason alone.\nIt's obvious that the developers stayed in their little ignorant bubble trying way too hard to be unique but ended up turning what could have been one of the best C&C clones ever made. They didn't do ANY research into as to how RTS games that have been refined through other studios successes and mishaps within the very genre it's trying to tackle, nor did they even research into genres like the isometric MOBA games that have blown the gaming world wide open due to how custimisable they are, which has essentially made them take over the RTS genre. Where customisable options for the player is key to make the experience more fluent are a godsend, welcomed with open arms by players who want a clean experience within their strategy game, 'Act of Aggression' fails, and fails hard.\nPeople compare this game to 'C&C: Generals'? Those people need to get real. 'Generals' had, and still has, commercial freighter loads more character and overall colour than this game will ever have.\nIf you're going to play any RTS games by Eugen, then play 'Act of War: Direct Action', any of the 'Wargame' releases or just don't bother and just buy something like the 'Dawn of War' collection and have fun with the mods that are out there.\nAgain, I'll compare this game to porridge; it's bland and boring - avoid it completely if you have gaming taste buds.\nI'll give you my opinion on the graphics; there's way too much clutter and things going on to actually truly 'see' anything that's special. When you see so many explosions within a game just from units blowing up in ridiculous ways, it makes the bigger explosions of things like super weapons not seem as grand, you know? The graphics just end up becoming a messy affair and seem to be a 'means to an end' because they've tried to realistically scale it - which completely fails in an RTS game and devoids the entire game of any sort of character or life. Look at every single successful RTS game out there that's memorable, and that's been successful - they've all been on a disproportioned scale so that you can visually enjoy what the art department has created for you, the gamer! This isn't the case with 'Act of Aggression'! They've made it an absolute chore to try and enjoy the details that they created! It makes no sense! Come to think of it... the entire package just... makes no sense... there's literally no creative direction behind a VIDEO GAME here.\nIf you're going to go with realistic or believable scaling then create a 1st person, or 3rd person game - don't do it within an RTS... of all genres to pick?!\nIf you're going to buy this game, then buy it after the game has been fixed for usability and don't pay any more than £15 because it completely fails to carry the hype torch that the creative director made it out to be able to carry.\nMy final words to you are the following; there is no 'game' here... it's just a lot of chores followed by a visually lifeless mess... there's just no fun to be had here.\nMy overall rating for 'Act of Aggression' is; 3/10\n\np.s. To also think that an RTS game in 2015 had a beta and nothing got improved upon with the ability to remap your mouse and entire keyboard? Now that is insane and proves that this game had no creative direction what-so-ever.","October 6, 2015","false","64.7"," 66 of 123 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","66","123","4","1"

Loved the game to death.\nI saw total biscuit cover this game on his channel.\nNow, I don't always agree with TB, but his views are arguements are solid most of the time.\n\nI've been playing the game for a few days now, and am playing ranked at a  mid-high / low-high level.\nI've been watching streamers, and have been around the forums collecting information.\nI have not played the single player.\n\nWith those things in mind, i'm going to write a review with points I feel are very important and worth mentioning.\n\npositives:\n- Familiar feel / atmosphere\n- Unit variety\n- 3 factions semi-asymetrical\n- fairly active community (as of now)\n- Symetrical maps\n- Intensive micro\n- Fairly complex resource management\n- Posibility for different styles of play\n- Game looks pretty decent\n- Benchsmarks and chooses settings automatically at the start (can change manually in the options)\n\nNegatives\n- Symetrical maps\n- Varying quality of voice acting\n- 0.5 seconds unit reaciton to inputs\n- Factions are semi-asymetrical\n- Missing functionalities (there's quite a few, so i'll put these in the explenation)\n- Dev's give suggestion topics the silent treatment a lot\n- No tutorial / difficulty curve\n- No rebindable hotkeys / weird hotkeys\n- General lack of polish / unfinished feel\n\n\n\nPositives expanded:\n- Right off the bat, the music and looks plunge you into a sense of familiarity and nostalgia.\nFor me this was Red allert music, combined with visuals in a way that reminded me of Command and conquer generals (just WAY better). So, the atmosphere is set, and it's a plus. Units look flavourful, and have personalities (some just more than others, but more on this later).\n- Every faction has a variety in units, some very specialized and some good for general purpose. Allowing for variety in your strategy, or in unit selection to counter your oponents.\n- Every faction has it's own strongsuits and weakpoints. This emphazises certain gameplay in certain matchups, or in general. I consider this to be a pro and a con.\n- Both on the forums, in the chat and to a lesser extend in the (ranked) matchmaking, there's a lot of people active. It's 500 on low-tide, and 1500 at rush hours. Keep into consideration that this is ALL PLAYERS, this means singleplayer, multiplayer, ranked and chatlobby.  So basically people that have the game on, not necesarily active in a certain aspect.\nThe forums are fairly active, with suggestion threads and some guides here and there.\n- The maps are symetrical, sometimes the resources are switched up a bit, but are always in the same place. The types may vary, but all in all it's fairly same-ey most of the time.\n- Units benefit HUGELY from micro. Splitting, focus firing,kiting, move-shooting, or preventing overkill is a HUGE part of the game.\n- There are 3 different types of resources, with each being less basic and necesary for more high tech upgrades and units. Every faction has it's own collection and deposit system. What they all share is that for the aluminum and rare earth is that there's a cap on how much you can STORE at a time. This capacity can be upgraded with certain buildings.\nThere is also the prisoner of war system, capturing wounded enemy infantry or stranded vehicle pilots will bolster your economy with extra instant income, and with resource trickle, if you have the facilities to keep them in.\n- As every faction is different, and they have unit variety, you can opt for different strategies. Given not all of them work well vs certian factions or for certain factions, and there will always be a baseline, I feel that you have some wiggleroom to implement a strategem you prefer, going for certain unit and upgrades to supplement, or work around with your main army.\n- I saw a lot of people complaign about the graphics, but honestly? They're pretty damn good, and i'm not even running it at the fullest! The units look great, the environments are serviceable, though apearantly the tree's look pretty bad(?) until the point that it becomes somewhat of a meme to joke about them. Disclaimer: I'm a gameplay over graphics kind of person.\n- Benchmarking automatically, is LOVELY. This prevents you from having to fiddle in settings to find an optimum for looks, while giving the game a good run. Alright, when I spam AoE artillery the game drops a bit in framerate, but hey...it's not that bad.  The downside is that the game FORCES the benchmark, and this takes a few minutes.\n\nNegatives\n- The symetrical map makes it so that there's very little variety in tactical positioning you can do.\n- Some of the units have better LINES, but also better VOICEACTING. Some units are AMAZING (the punisher) some just are lame, and underwhelming (Vanguard sounds like a nervous frenchman, that forgot his anxiety medication and is wondering if he left the stove on at home.  He is supposed to be a highly trained uber-elite-mercenary).\n- This is something EVERYBODY complains about. When you click somewhere, the units take time to respond to your click. This is not due to lag, but it feels like it is. This makes micro so much more hard. Questions and accusations to the dev's yield little response. This is a HUGE factor in the game's enjoyment and playability imho.\n- The game is Semi-asymetrical. Every faction has a main battletank, troop transport, anti personel / AT -infantry. All with little specialisations and nuances, but in the end every faction has units that fill the same role in varying degrees of succes. (for example: US has a sniper, that is cloacked and has a long range, Cartel has a superfast (super squishy) sniper car with room for 2 passengers and medium-high firing range, while the Chimera have a stealth detecting sniper with Anti material rifle (good vs light vehicles AND infantry).\n- Lack of a timer, and a ton of other small functionalites put a HUGE damper on the playability and overal feel of the game. I'll put a link to a suggestion thread with all the missing functionality and you can determine for yourself how much of an issue it is.\n- If the dev's respond to the topics (containing suggestions), it's always very short, and very general / vague. More often than not, they just forego the trouble of opening their mouths to make themselves look a certain way, instead they just give everything the silent treamtent as a whole. Making them look like they don't care, and like they're not really incharge of situations that arise. This doesn't help me keep confidence in future titles they might or might not release.\nNow, in their favour: They have made some changes to certain mechanics that were getting a lot of flakk, but that might've been a one time occurence, only time will tell.\n- The game features no tutorial. If you want to learn to play, you've got the single player, skirmish or just downright multiplayer action. Reading guides and practising (and failing) are a MUST, if you want to get started. Luckily there is a replay system that you can use. It's basic, but it work to be able to analyse your matches (no going back on the timeline in the replay though...which just blows my mind).\n- Hotkeys. Some of the hotkeys are pretty decent, situated around the WASD combination. BUT! Then there's LUDICRIOUS ones, like ; to build a certain unit from a building. That is WAY too much space to cover quickly and efficiently. There's also very few hotkeys you can rebind. Suggestions for gridlock hotkeys have been made  (option 1 = q option 2 = w option 3 = e etc etc.) But....silent treatment.\n- This a more generalized feel, that just stems from all the things combined. I feel that all the small faults and irks in unit movement, missing functionality, voice acting quality, makes a big wrong, that I really want to ephasize. It's that nagging feeling that you get, that something isn't quite right.\n\nThere is more, but character limit.","September 7, 2015","false","144.6"," 46 of 85 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","46","85","5","12"

Why doesn't newer version include custom option from the original ?\nAnd why did they not add this custom option from reboot to the original if it was so many times requested from majority fo the community ?\n\nUpdate 24.03.2016\n\nReboot Edition.\n\nMan that the Version a majority of people did want here from start.\n+ The balance seems to be better\n+ no stupid Tower rushes anymore\n+ Unit Size\n\nBad Side is:\n-Income rate could be better, its extreme slow .\n-The AI sucks on the current stage, really bad and easy to defeat.\n-Well why did they take it so long, to realize this all problems,\nmeanwhile online sadly not really populated.\n-Yeah meanwhile nobody is on-line.\n\n\nbut still it's a big step compared top the previous version.\n\nYou can see that by the reboot edition they did put a lot of work,\nbut work that had to be done likea year ago.\n\nAt least they did try to fix the game 1 year later lol.\n\n\nThe Mayor problem by the game is just that the developer does ignore the community.\nI mean by the previous "Original AoA" game people did write already in the beta what is to do,\nbut was ignored.\n\n\nNow we have just a mayor problem that the game is by start extreme lame and repetitive.\nLook here even on the homepage several people did respond and on steam too.\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/318020/discussions/0/385428943463059188/\nhttp://forums.eugensystems.com/viewtopic.php?f=192&t=56927\nhttp://forums.eugensystems.com/viewtopic.php?f=192&t=56944\nhttp://forums.eugensystems.com/viewtopic.php?f=192&t=56955\nhttp://forums.eugensystems.com/viewtopic.php?f=192&t=56950\n\n\nIn my opinion that stuff would be extremely easy to fix, is several times mentioned and suggested what to , how to fix an so on. And even if everybody who purchased the previous game can play the reboot, its still dead on-line.\n\n\nThe developer just does not realize what here. If they wanted with the reboot to have the community back, they did totally miss the point, just by ignoring to fix obvious stuff, what besides could have been easily done.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nOn the Current Stage I have to write a Negative review about this game.\n\nI am personally a huge RTS fan and was with this game from start on.\n\n\n1 Really bad Early and Late game performance.\n- Well the Tank rush is just not stoppable, if you don't have just more tanks in late game. So the game is just about to build more tanks Abrams as USA or more terminators as Chimera to achieve a victory.\nAll the other units here are just not efficient vs Abrams and Terminator.\n\n- The Second Point is the really nasty rushes, after the last patch it becomes more worse.\nSo in stead a simply rush where you need just to buy troopers to counter, the enemy now place Refinery near your base and spams he MG-nests or Artillery Defense Towers.\n\n2 The AI works only by USA Faction, by the other 2 factions its much weaker. USA AI use Nukes, the other 2 never use their super weapons.\n\n3 Well the Story is a big disappointment.\n\n4 Awful Faction balance.\n\n5 Really Bad camera,\nThe high"satellite" view just turns the game in black and white screen, if you goa little higher.\n\n6 Complete Ignoring of the community.\nWhat wrong with the game had been several times mentioned by the community, from start on.\nThe developer just did improve here nothing since Early Access.","February 8","false","87.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The units dont seem to have the same "oomph factor" as they did in generals. Recognizing that, YES, this is not the same game, The units and structures are not easily identifiable as they dont have unique outlines (Im looking at you US), and generally lack formidable stopping power. I found myself losing consistently to people fielding units that i HAD the hard-counter for but had out produced me. Maybe im spoiled from playing Wargame: Red Dragon, but when my tank or attack helo shoots at something, it needs to die rapidly if its not armoured. Whether im just playing the game wrong is irrelevant to me at this point, i have no desire to be good at it because to do so, I will need to memorize a solid starting build order, manage my economy between three resources, buy upgrades in the right order, spam the right units, move my blob around, kite with artillery blah blah blah......

There are a few minor things that I think could be improved upon like fog of war and line of sight being a bit small. As well as the inability to build runways and control planes for air combat and controlling your bombers to avoid setup defences etc.\n\nThe only obvious downside is that there are a small number of players online at any one time, if you want to join random games and pit yourself against new people. I howver didn't buy the game for that, so It doesn't bother me in the slightest.\n\nThe Reboot edition has been my favourite version of this game however, with more focus on the fighting aspect of the game which utilises the games strong elements of the game, vs the more complex resource gathering of the original version.\n\nThe ability to switch between these two versions of the game is fantastic, allowing the player to choose what style they wish to play.\n\nThe Reboot feels like a far more C&C Generals style (which I prefer).\n\nWhichever type of game you chose, it's win win in my book.","April 23","true","47.0"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

In terms of an RTS, I think it's really, really good if you're feeling sick of Starcraft and want something more in the vein of C&C Generals. Yes, resource placement can sometimes be an issue, but its not insurmountable. As far as complaints about units looking the same, I don't get what the problem is. Every unit is labeled, and they all do in fact look different, particularly after upgrades. Sure if you play the game for 5 minutes you might be confused at first, but you learn to easily recognize the differences and move on.\n\nThe game has an incredible amount of depth, and I never felt like I had to adopt the same strategy every game in order to win. Is the game perfect? Obviously not. Resources tend to run out fairly quickly, the randomized placement is sometimes not ideal, and superweapons are really op.(but can be disabled, so it's not a big deal). With that said, it's a really great old-school RTS set in the modern era, and makes for a welcome change to playing Starcraft for your RTS fix.","October 27, 2015","true","100.9"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

Game is unpolished.\n\nA few things that would make this a star game\n\n1. Get rid of the Massive overkill.\n2. Fix control groups(multiple buildings on one hotkey, etc)\n3. Make ALL controls rebindable.(really bad for veteran RTS players... we know how we like to play... please let us.\n4. Fix pathing. I can understand you want some physics to the game, but the units feel very sluggish.\n5. Since this is a "casual" game, some clear guidance to new players for victory conditions(ie, once   -------enemy HQ is destroyed what else needs to die to win, etc.)\n6. Infantry are awesome units, however, please rethink some of the encounters they receive. Once example is artillery. Artillery is NOT A FATALITY producing unit. Its a morale lowering and injury producing unit. So why does it one shot infantry. I would love to be able to make armies of infantry and be viable as im sure others would.(I understand the transport piece, however, infantry is underwelming unless it's AA infantry.)\n7. Fixed\n8. The resource system is.... convoluted how many refineries to make X unit from X building...idk because sometimes due to pathing issues i have no money.. then im maxed out on money again.( I believe a fix would be make it so we can place extension modules(faction equivalent right next to refineries)\n9. That's all from me.

Their previous RTS Act of War was way better in my opinion.  My over all biggest complaint though is the complete lack of quality maps from the developer or a development tool to make your own.  Even DLC map packs would help but so far nothing.  I also find that this game is not at all for your more defensively minded players.  You pretty much have to be an aggressive attacker to have any chance of winning because enemies will quickly overwhelm any defenses you build by just spamming artillery units at you.  Over all I feel that most units also either have to low of health or to high of damage and need to be balanced.  The battles that do happen seem to end so quickly they barely feel like they did happen and air units get shot out of the air like they are nothing.  It definitely could have been better.

I got hooked on their first game R.U.S.E, which still has great graphics and gameplay.  Next game the Wargame trilogy which is as realistic an RTS you could play with units ranging in age from 1946 - 1992...Any war hardware guru's fantasy!\n\nOne great thing Eugen does is reward its fans who bought previous titles.  So each title I bought, I would recieve a discount for pre-ordering the next one, I think this is a cool way of paying it forward to the fans.  So obviously I wanted to play Act of Aggression as I was a big fan of C&C Generals and they are similar.\n\nAct of Aggression plays very fast which can be overwhelming if you try a skirmish for the first time.  The economy is complex and unique to any RTS I have seen, and semi-random in resource locations which is interesting.  Once you get a hang of the economy, you really need to learn the units, which their are quite a lot of.  Once you have learned the units, then the game truly gets fun because you start to build your strategy and army compositions.\n\nI am about 5 missions into the campaign and it is very polished and interesting.  I actually got my ♥♥♥ kicked on the 5th mission where you get command of the US forces.  They give you a beat up base that you repair and rebuild while defending it, and as you attack the main enemy base, another of your allies bases comes under attack and now you have to protect this one while simultaneously getting a few new units.\n\nWOW...missions 1-4 is slowly introudcing you to some of the units but then all of a sudden you recieve basically a whole new faction of units.\nI can see how this would be overwhelming to a lot of people, but I would say the depth means that you will be growing and learning a lot for a long time and I think that the TLDR; is one word - DEPTH.\n\nThis RTS is deep and has a wide variety of units and tactics, and each race feels very different from each other.  Loving it so far!  Graphics are great as well.\n\nOnly CON I would say is we need more music.  I have heard each song probably 10 times at this point, starting to turn off the music so I can stream C&C generals songs!","September 2, 2015","true","16.4"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","10","18","3","0"

AoA was released ten years after AoW, and yet its graphics are magnitudes inferior to AoW. Even by today's standards AoW's modeling and textures are superb. Meanwhile AoA's graphics leaves the game feeling like a mod laid overtop the base game. The developers said AoA would play like "90s Golden Age Real-Time Strategy Games," but it looks the part as well as it plays the part. It in fact looks like it could've been released alongside CnC:Generals Deluxe Edition in 2002. Which, AoA still wouldn't have been competitive back then because Generals DE cost $20 at launch, where AoA costs $50 today, more than double. Even had both games been sold for the same price, AoA still wouldn't have been competitive because Generals is much more alluring, less bugged, and is just more enjoyable overall. You won't be lured in to the RPG aspects of the universe in AoA, "creating your own story" in skirmishes as people would find themselves doing with Generals.\n\nBase building has been made artificially frustrating due to limitations resulting from the small building radius, even where expansion modules are concerned. There's a greater number of buildings to construct, units to field, resources to collect, and upgades to units which will actually change their appearance. However the implementation of all these things seems uninspired and sometimes outright annoying. For example, AoW's US Army tactical weapon, the Wolverine (Tomahawk) Cruise Missile, is replaced with the LGM-118 Peacekeeper in AoA , which is an ICBM that would obliterate the whole map in real life. The realistic missile silo is replaced with one in which the top pops up like one of those trash cans that you open with a pedal. If you want to upgrade your Marines so that they'll wear body armor, you can't do that unless you also upgrade them so that every one of them will give up with M16A1 assault rifles in exchange for an M249 SAW, a big, honking support weapon. These are just two of myriad examples of the nonsense which AoA presents.\n\nThe AI behaves ridiculously as well, including shamelessly cheating in immediately "sensing" any units you send onto its side of the map. A recon helicopter could be rapidly chased down and intercepted by AI tanks, which may shoot down your helicopter using its main gun, Battlefield 4 style. A lack of viable reconnaissance shouldn't be too crippling though, because resources are collected so fast that you'll be nearly immediately attacking your opponents massive unit spam with your own massive unit spam within the first few minutes of the skirmish. That could be a problem if you don't have a higher end gaming machine, considering AoA's poor graphics are even more poorly optimized, creating frame-rate issues. The AI also cheats in the most frustratingly notorious way imaginable: free money and resources, and lots of it.\n\nIt's no "spiritual successor" to Act of War, in the same way that Ghost Busters 3 won't be the spiritual successor to the previous Ghost Buster films. It's an interesting game, don't get me wrong, but it is badly executed, and it is, even today, bugged: good luck scrolling in 4K. If you ever played CnC Generals or Act of War, you won't play Act of Agression nearly as much as you played the former two. I do recommend the game, but not at its current price. Wait for the 50% off sale. Until then, you won't be missing out on too much.","May 9","true","9.8"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","19","36","4","0"

Still there are some good things in this game though, like plenty of units and upgrades to use, quite chalenging AI in skirmish on "Medium" and above, but... Maybe I should buy digital copy of High Treason instead of this.\n\nThe problem with the graphics in AoA, at least for me, is its lifeless feeling. Same was with Wargame and Ruse. The maps remind me that strange place outside the time flow from Stephen King's "The Langoliers": empty static landscapes with no tree animation, no flocks, no moving shadows from clouds... kreepy. Same stuff when the battle starts: lack of firing animation (No recoil!), poor and unimaginative firing FX, disappearing trees or bushes and units, which float through obstacles and fences like ghosts... Those graphic flaws adds no immersion whatsoever. Outsourced vehicle models  are good though.

It is quite unbalenced, Multiplayer is dead (understandably), and the Campaign is nightmarish. I am very sad to find out that it is so bad as I was hoping it would be like Ruse or Command and conquer and explore new, inovative ways to outwit and crush your enemy; making them watch helplessly as their base is razed to the ground, but it reminded me of a rip off command and conquer generals that didn't bother to steal any of the good ideas. It is all bad, all the time and seems like it was released entirely too early. The game feels like it is in the alpha stage. I waited on it to improve much in the same sense as a parent waits on a young child to quit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the bed. however, my patience was to no avail as the game just sits wallowing in it's feces with drool slowly streaming down its chin.","June 2","false","30.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Act of agression however delivers just that a great RTS experience that covers all the basics and keeps you on your toes through the match as you are forced to expand well beyond your save zone in order to keep your economy running.\n\nA great variaty of units and lots of upgrades keep you on your toes and ensure your units stay relavant, what I will say is that I find infantry units to be lacking outside of their ability to take buildings they are quite vurnerable and hence nearly all combat will be done by armor and supported by air.\n\nThe 3 factions are asymetrical which does adds this nice layer to the game and each clearly have their defined strengths, but in the end enough similarity so you are not thrown out of balance when switching factions. I personally would have loved to see it taken just a bit futher even.\n\nThe Campain is decent enough and nicely takes you through, but the story is well as classic as the RTS itself is.","December 14, 2015","true","21.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The resource mechanic is really nice and slightly differs per faction. unit diversity among the 3 factions is also good so you really play differently with each.\nwhat i dont like is the camera, the angle at which you zoom in , i really lose the overview. Any game for eternity should do it the way supreme commander did it. dont invent anything new, that camera was the ultimate camera.\ngame wise, what i miss is that units gain experience, eg. 1 -2-3 stars or something like that. if i have a tank and kept it alive through several battles it should be more effective than a new one fresh from the line.\nbtw whoever was responsible for the campaign, shame on you, thats just substandart par excellence.\nAnd sadly there are very few players. i guess there is some sort of matchmaking taking place, since i cannot see the level of other players. matchmaking sucks, it always sucked and why its still alive is beyond me.\nSo overall i would give this a 7/10. if you like RTS its a nice addition to your library and online games can be fun, although my experience there is limited.","December 19, 2015","true","24.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What does this mean to you when I say it?  I imagine most of you, much like myself, imagine a group moving at the same speed so that they remain in the same group.  This game have no concept of it.  If you select a group containing vehicles/air/infantry they will take different paths and arrive all at different times.  Good luck with this if you're waging a multi-front engagement.\n\nSupport units.  If they are with your combat units they will not stay with them.  When the group is engaged en route they will continue while under fire to their end destination.  What the heck?  Furthermore, if the group is stationary and comes under fire the unarmed repair units run away.  Really ruins the point of a combat engineer/medic.\n\nDefense.  Woefully insufficient in most cases.  Chimera probably has the best but the others are just sad.\n\nArtillery.  That there's no defense for these, especially with specifying ground attack, this is a horrible imabalance.  A similar mechanic to the anti-missile would be a good solution.  A player with antleys and rhinos should not be unstoppable.\n\nThere's a plethora of other enhancements that would make this game great.  In some other postings I have seen that people complain about the 3 resources.  A silly complaint in my opinion.  Another complaint I've heard is about how the building works.  It's rather nice in this game and I don't understand people's issue with it.\n\nThey plan to do a reboot and I am waiting to see what enhancements are made.\n\nDespite what I have said, I recommend this game.  If you're on the fence, don't get it, it won't blow your mind.  But if RTS is your cup of tea, buy it as you will most certainly enjoy it.","March 19","true","118.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I will be playing it for a long time. Finally, a quality RTS game that has all my favorite elements.\nBy Andrei Pankov on September 3, 2015\nI have been playing Act of Aggression now for about 3 weeks. I'm one of the lucky few to have seen the game while it was still in the beta phase. I am so happy for this game! I'm a die hard RTS fan, and I must say, there have not been any quality titles in the RTS genre in a while until now. (The only one at this time I also play is Company of Heroes 2, but it has been on the marked for a long time now). Act of aggression is wonderful in all respects. Graphics are fantastic. Units are interesting and variable in their uses. 3 factions to choose from have their own strengths and weaknesses. It's a pure joy to play this game online multiplayer or against a computer AI opponent. I have not played the single player campaign yet, as it has just been released, but I'm looking forward to doing so soon. Usually with the games like Act of Aggression the most fun is found in the multiplayer matches, best played against another human. It's so fun to play against another human being who is intelligent and able to react/adjust his strategy based on your own approach.\n\nThere have bee many RTS games over the years, and I want more to be made! I derive a lot of joy from building a base, making an army, and then attacking and seeing what happens. I do not need any innovation in what I already consider to be a great game design. I also hope there will be more DLCs coming out for this game. I already clocked more then 100 hours playing this game and I foresee myself playing it more and more in the upcoming months.","September 8, 2015","true","121.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Because when C&C first came out, it was in it's day one of the first to really take the RTS genre by storm, and earned a strong reputation for itself and set a rather high quality bar for others to succeed.\n\nAct of Aggression though has almost all I want out of an RTS title - Intricate resource management (they differ a bit between the factions involved), alot of detail in both units and structures, semi-realistic capabilities of units and their weaponry with a nice touch of futuristic technology, and highly variable units between the factions.\nThe weapons at your disposal are MANY, mostly structured around heavy tank combat and artillery, guerilla warfare with soldiers, followed by highly dangerous but vulnerable aircrafts and helicopters.\nThe only thing I find lacking in the game is the single player campaign, although the missions themselves were quite interesting and some rather difficult for a mediocre RTS player like myself, the introductions to the missions were a bit simplistic to my taste.\n\nIt might have had some ugly bugs on the initial launch of the title, but I personally was never bothered by it, I expected it as most should nowadays with games rolling out of the Early Access program far too soon to earn it's keep during production and advertising.\n\nOn my personal scoreboard I give it 8/10\n\nOne point lost due to overlapping sounds making my speakers screetch in pain at times with 12 Terminator tanks bombarding hard targets (this goes for almost all units if their numbers are fairly large).\n\nAnother point lost due to rather weak single player campaign cinematics, making the game feel a bit "cold" to me, they never really gave me an interesting taste of the story, luckily the gameplay is far stronger.\n\n\nA good RTS game for those "dying" to rediscover their RTS passions!","September 15, 2015","true","323.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Someone looking for a C&C experience with modern tech should just play Command and Conquer: Generals with the "Rise of the Reds" mod. (Sorry Eugen.)\n\nThe economy is probably the part that gets to most players, and will likely scare off all  but the most dedicated RTS veterans. With three different resources and a need for stability of income over a large surplus, it largely resembles that of Supreme Commander. In fact the power supply system would be identical if AoA just gave the amount of stored power a solid number.\n\nOne issue that is more significant than the economy is the linear nature of the upgrades, which at the endgame basically means that the only unit you will want to manufacture in force is Main Battle Tanks. When fully upgraded your MBTs can pretty much handle whatever the enemy throws at them and the strategy suddenly devolves into "click on tank horde, click on enemy base."\n\nOf course this is an issue with the small units in the endgame, and by the endgame you will have superweapons and bombers to harrass their base, however my point is that it makes spending painfully scarce resources on upgrades for something like a humvee seem like a waste.\n\nDo not however get me wrong, as you will notice I did in fact recommend this game, why? Because everything in between the economy startup and the endgame nuclear apocalypse is what makes it all worth it. The diversity of units, the desperate defence of isolated resource gatherers, the sneaky infantry climbing up a cliff and inserting a mortar into your backside and the US using a strategy I never thought possible, "Turret rush."","March 3","true","54.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/electrolux/recommended/318020/","electrolux","Electro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/electrolux/","212 products in account","The Reboot edition makes this an amazing RTS. It is included with every version of the game, and you just select Reboot Edition when launching the game from Steam. It still takes a while to level up your tech to end game, but single resource economy is a huge win. While the Cartel and Chimera factions do provoke some raised eyebrows at a few things, the gameplay in Act of Aggression is great and the units in the realistic US faction at least bring back fond memories of other legendary RTS games. It's a lot of fun to load up an Osprey with Delta infantry and drop it on an enemy occupied bank. The fact that you have to call in fixed wing support and it doesnt just circle on station endlessly adds a nice touch of "Wargame" franchise style realism. Upgrades are everything in this game. Expect to spend and extra 2k credits on some units to make them fully powered and operational, and you'll have to buy ammo for your top tier defensive systems like Patriots. This is worth while as they can intercept "Tactical weapons" (super waepons, nukes and the like).  The economy is still the core to this game, and even on the lowest difficulties, this game is unforgiving if you fumble the economy for even a little bit. The AI will wreck you when your production grinds to a halt. The campaign/story is alright, serves the purpose if you leave your expectations far enough behind.  On the whole, if you are a fan of classic RTS games like C&C and the newer ones like Wargame this will be a fun ride. It definitely gives you the feel of a good resource/base-building RTS with just enough of the new tricks. Definitely worth while on sale. At full price, only if you love RTS games a lot (in which case you probably already have this).","March 27","true","4.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I was expecting the "usual" Steam-released game, but what I found was a fairly well-balanced and well-planned game with an AI that poses a serious challenge (without simply cheating like the AI in Supreme Commandr, for example).  I was honestly expecting the AI to simply bum rush me in the first 10 minutes, but in the skirmish I played (on an  player map) it took over an hour before first contact was made.  Even after first contact, the expected bum rush didn't occur.  Instead, the AI sniped at me from my perimeter until he figured out where my bases were, then attacked in a coordinated strike.  It might have been a coincidence, but color me impressed.  I'll certainly be coming bck to this game to complete the campaign, as well as to play some multiplayer against humans.  My next foray will be me against 2 AI players on the same 8 player map.  It took me an hour to beat a single AI on the hardest setting, so I'm curious what 2 AI players (on the same team) will do.

I have played everything from Empire Earth to Command and conquer, SIns of a solar empire to Supreme Commander. I have been quite disheartened the last couple of years only releasing a very few decent strategy games.\n\nThat being said, this game is now near the top of my favorite RTS games list. Its a throwback to the fun medium paced games like command and conquer with effects I've only noticed in games such as RUSE (artillery looks very beautiful in the pale moon glow...). Plus, mechanics I've never seen before such as taking prisons of war to supplement your income and garrisoning banks to raid their vaults adds some flare. As of 16 Hrs of game play, this game has me hooked and if you want to feel the joy of destroying a base with a wave of tanks like in the RTS of old, but want new mechanics and systems to learn, then I heartily recommend this game.","September 8, 2015","true","32.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The reason for this is that mp in an rts is very hard to judge since preference and skill level play an important part in this. I recommend to go and look at some replays to see if would enjoy it.\n\nLets start with what the game offers\n\nThe Campaign15 Missions: 10 for the EU(Chimera) and US faction and 5 for the Cartel\nAt first it seams that this would be 2 different Campaings but story wise they are the same but from different perspectives. This means to fully understand the story you should play EU/US till you unlock a new Cartel mission then do the Cartel mission and then switch back to the EU/US missions. This is quite annoying and can create a confuse story if you don’t do it that way.\n\nPro\n+Clever Designed missions. Each mission you have to approach differently and they were quite creative when it comes to missions design.\n+ Quite Challenging. I consider myself to be quite good at RTS and still some of the later missions gave me quite a bit of trouble.\n+ Optional objective. During the missions you will get optional objectives that you can fulfill for achievements some of them are quit tricky to get and some even secret. For Completionist this gives you a reason to play the campaign or at least some missions multiple times.\n+ Okay length if you don’t rush it and take your time (Took me about 15h)Cons\n- Only 15 Missions 3 of them are Tutorial missions.\n- No real tutorial\nThe tutorial missions are a clever way to teach the player but they are not in depth enough and don’t explain all the mechanics\n- No Skirmish missions\nAll the missions during the campaign are special situations and won’t really prepare you for a real match. I would have preferred if there were 1 or 2 missions that would put you on a normal map against a normal ai , so that the campaign prepares you a bit for the real game.\n- Some missions give you too many new units at once\nThe missions often have a huge gap in the amount of different units that are available which can be overwhelming and doesn’t teach to the usage of each different unit.\n- Meh story\nWell the story really lacks epicness since its tries to stay realistic. It also lacks in presentation during the missions its often just some voice action that tells you different things.\n- Disappointing cut scenes\nAgain a presentation problem :/My thoughts\nThe campaign was more a set of neat challenges instead of a good story. If you really need a story you will be quit disappointed. But If you want some unique challenges and are willing to learn things by yourself then the campaign can be entertaining.\n\nSkirmishIn addition to the Campaign there is a skirmish mode against the AI\nThere are 18 Maps (7 of them are for 1v1)\nThe game supports Up to 8 players\nEach map can only be played in the allowed modes of the map which is strange. The modes are 1v1,2v2,3v3,4v4,2v2v2v2, FFA. If a map supports the wanted mode is listed right next the map. This means that you can NOT do custom teams or play every map in FFA\nThe AI has 5 difficulty settings which is nice\nThere are also additional settings like if super weapons are allowed, the amount of starting resources, or a maximum time limit\n\nMy thoughts\nDespite the weird mode enforcement I think the skirmish provides everything you want and allows for some nice comp stomp\n\nThe game itselfIt’s a “standard” rts you build your base you seek expansions you harras your opponent you expand. However this game has some nice twists.\nResources are scattered “random” and you have to find them before you can use them which changes the map a bit every time you play.\nYou have a nice urban warfare mechanic where you can go into building and even storm building controlled by the enemy\nNo Unit limit for epic battles\nSuper weapons and anti-super weapons\nUnit gets wounded when killed and can be captured by the enemy for resources. This might be annoying at first but adds a nice dynamic to the gameOverall if you like an rts in a “realistic” setting I don’t see a reason why you would not enjoy it. Some mechanics require getting used to but they are actually smart additions.\n\nThe factionsAs said there are 3 Different factions however they all play quite similar. They are more like C&C factions than Starcrafts factions. They all have similar units but often they have a little quirk or property that makes them different from each other.\nFor me the factions are varied enough. All play a little different and have their own little weaknesses and strengths but nothing drastic.\n\nGraphicsWell this is quite subjective but I think the games looks really nice especially the explosives and effects.\nYou have an insane Zoom Level and can Zoom in quite Close and Far.\nThe only problem I have is that at higher Zoom levels infantry becomes hard to identify which is quite a pain. The devs should have made them easier to extinguish.\nOverall I can’t complain the explosions look awesome what more can you ask for especially when there is no unit cap :)\n\nControlsI have 3 problems with the controls.\nFirst you can't rebind everything. You can rebind certain actions like “Unload” but you can’t change the hotkeys for units. If you are someone who uses hotkey frequently this might really annoy you. But I think that the game is still playable without them and enjoy able.\nThe second problem is the delay. Units don’t respond instantly in this game. My guess is that this should emulate “realistic” behavior. As someone who plays Company of heroes it isn’t that bad but if you are accustomed to something like Starcraft than it might be annoying.\nThe last problem is pathing. If you command a bigger groups of units and try to funnel them through something small you might encounter some pathing bugs. Nothing serious but still annoying when it happensOther than these problems the controls are pretty good. If you set a hotkey to a new building you get an icon of that building to your hotkey which is neat.  It also allows to move your units at the same speed.\n\nPerformanceMy PC is not the strongest but I still could run the game at a pretty high setting with a frame rate of about 30-40. However the game can get quite chaotic and really tank the frame rate if too many big effects hit the screen.\nDuring 20 hours of game play I only experienced a single crash.\n\nFinal thoughtsQuite bombastic RTS that feels instantly familiar if you played any older rts like C&C generals. It adds quite a lot of small but interesting features that create a nice gameplay. It campaign might be a bit lacking but it skirmish/online component make up for it.\nIIt is by no means perfect but it is really fun and if you look past it small flaws it offers a new old school rts and tons of fun..","September 9, 2015","true","37.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

A "WORHTY BUY" if you are a big RTS fan.\nA very well optimized PC game with beautiful detailed graphics.\n\nThere is a lack of a tutorial, but if you can read & watch YouTube Videos then you will be fine.\n\n*****Please invest in the initial butt kicking you may get before getting better, and before writting negative reviews because you suck at learning and applying a little bit of perseverance.\n\nIn it's current state: Just jumped from a 3.8 to 4.1 out of 5 which is fantastic, and this is only the beta.\nLet them fix the helicopter and attack pathfidning issue and it will be a classic.\nLet them add mod support, custom maps, and 4th Faction (a Eastern Coalition Faction of Russia and China uniting) with good balancing and it will be in my top 10 RTS games of all time.\n\n\n\nI own just about every RTS you could think of.  If you are an old school RTS fan then you will really enjoy this.  It does need a little bit of work, but if you miss old school RTS action then please pick this up.\n\nInfantry are useful, and the fact they are safer in buildings early to mid game ROCKS. So many other RTS games get this wrong. It should take a certain units & a little bit of time to root out an enemy in urban combat areas.\n\nYou can heal infantry and repair buildings, and I hope they do not cave into changing how hard it is to take a base that has a good defensive set up which reminds me of "Red Alert 2." You actually have to think in order to take a base, what a concept. :)\n\n\n\nThe negative reviews are from some RTS gamers that are spoiled with the recent slew of quick, fast paced, and simple RTS mechanics. Yet this approach has taken most of the fun out of the word STRATEGY from the RT"S" genre of gaming.\n\nIt also appears many of them have not taken the time to invest in understanding how the mechanics work which are not super new if you are an experienced RTS gamer (casual or hardcore.)\n\nIf you are disgusted with the way DoW 2 went downhill MP wise from Dawn of War 1 and highly disgusted with the way CoH 2 went downhill MP wise from Company of Heroes then you will really enjoy this game.\n\n\n\nNote 1: The Economy\nIs not as bad as Supreme Commander, please don't be scared of it.\nIt is slightly more difficult just by a simple notch than most RTS games, and I mean simple.\nIt took me 2-3 long skirmish matches to get the economy down pat, but it was not that hard.\nIt also involves a certain strat in what you build and at what time you build it just like SC 2 early game, but after that then you can start to pump units out.\n\nNote 2: Helicopter Animatiojns\nThe animations of the helicopters is really bad, but hopefully once they fix this it will just add to the loads of fun you will have playing each faction and yes it will take you time to learn each faction but not as much as you think.\n____________________________________\n\nUpdate: 4-3-2016\nOriginal much better than the new Reboot.\n\nWe get to keep the original but they had to dumb this game down due to the annoying spoiled gamers that want things simple and fast paced.\n\nOriginal= Recommended for RTS Vets & People with an average or more than average sized brain.\nReboot= Recommended for Simple Minded gamers with a slightly smaller than averaged sized brain.\n\nNot that having a smaller brain is a bad thing. The game can still be fun, but the Reboot has lost a lot of the strategy options and variables that made the original an "instant classic" for me.\n\nNote: We get to keep the Original and play both games so YES buy the game; also a shout out to the Developers for allowing us to keep both & for all their hard work to make this game appeal to two different camps of RTS gamers.\n\nThank you Devs and If you read all of this review then what are you waiting for- BUY THE GAME NOW!

Is it good? Well, it's not bad. But it's not great. From wonky camera controls and views, to imbalanced unit compositions and a mediocore singleplayer campaign that tries a little hard to be C&C. While it's undoubtedly impossible to mimic the greatness of the C&C franchise, it's not uncommon to see games doing it well. Sadly, this is not one of those games. It could use a lot more balancing and personality. And quite frankly I find the use of resources and their corresponding buildings infuriating at times.

It is good but the factions lack diversity and the best tactic can be to rush the enemy at the start of the game. Also the resource system is a double edged sword. While randomly generated resources mean games will always differ, sometimes you never have enough aluminium or rare earth or cash or all three at once. Also one the subjest of resources the game will often tell you, that you have too much of one resource and you must build more storage facilities. This is fine I like to be kept on top of things. Late game however, this can become a problem as it doesn't tell you which resource is full, leaving you to guess between rare earth and aluminum. Having said this the game is fun and does have moments that make you fell warm and fuzzy inside.

Luckily, Eugen Systems gave us Act of Aggression!\n\nThe game has a classic RTS feel and play style which works great for me. But they also use new concepts to make this game feel renewed. The main thing is using three resources which all have their importance and spawn around the map randomly every time you play a map, scouting for them is therefore always needed.\n\nThe game unfortunantly also has a small minus when it comes to certain props like fences and cars. Infantry can move right through them and walk up cliffs. This is a bit weird and will take some getting used to, but doesn’t effect too much of the overall feeling in my opinion. The game could also do good in the RTS tournament scene for those interested. All in all I find it a well made game with the quality of triple A but at a lower price.\n\nAs a last note, I see/hear a lot of people saying it’s the next Generals.

It's seriously criminal that some people have rated it so low and that it doesn't have a bigger population than it does currently. If you like traditional RTS games such as CNC and Starcraft then this is the perfect game for you. It has the perfect blend from those titles. It's basically command and conquer merged with Starcraft's macro and a more complex resource system.\n\nYou can really tell the developers worked hard on this game, the more I play it the more I love it because you start seeing the genius behind everything. A quick example would be how the resources are proceduraly generated. Because of this you can play the same map over and over and the game honestly plays out different based on what resource type spawns in what location and you HAVE to scout them to see what they are.  I'm not exaggerating when I say this game has more depth than Starcraft 2.\n\nAll three factions are badass and none of them have glaring balance issues that just makes you HATE playing against them like in so many other RTS titles.  Everytime I run up against a unit or a strategy that I find to be overpowered I always soon discover an intuitive way to counter it. The game isn't realistic but it's almost as if you can apply real world logic to situations in-game to overcome them, such as infantry being way more effective garrisoned in buildings or using patriot missiles to control air space.\n\nI think that's why so many people are disappointed because it's not anywhere near as realistic as this company's previous titles. Then it's much more complicated than command and conquer and as a result way more difficult to play. The game is unforgiving, some of your units (especailly early game) can die so fast meaning you can literally lose the game with one misclick, just like in Starcraft.\n\nI really can't do this game justice in this simple short review. It runs great, it looks great and is just masterfully crafted. The ONLY gripe I have about this game where I could see it being an issues for more serious players is you are limited in what keybinds you can change but I have already read a devpost saying they plan to rectify that soon.\n\nI loved Tiberian sun, Generals and Red Alert 3 and this game absolutely exceeds those titles in every way imaginable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GuardsmansGaming/recommended/318020/","GuardsmansGaming","Cadian Guardsman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GuardsmansGaming/","142 products in account","I've been playing Eugen System games since Act of War came out and while I was initially a fan I have to say that now I'm probably their biggest detractor. Infact I will humour you with my review of Act of Aggression taken straight from my practice script for a video I was going to to but turned into a 12 minute rant.\n\nAct of Aggression is a RTS that claims to be a return to the classical style of RTS. Many games have attempted to return to this classic style of RTS with the biggest highlight being the spectacular mismanagement of C&C Generals 2 by EA.\n\nLet me settle one thing first, Act of War and Wargame:European Escalation are some of my favourite games. Wargame was innovative and unique at the time of it release whereas Act of War was campy and fun. In these games we see the best that Eugen could do. Act of War, though fun was a C&C clone with all the failings and successes of C&C Generals. It had some interesting gimmicks that made it stand out from the group but on the whole it was a standard game backed up by solid voice acting and fun live action videos. I mention this because it is Act of Aggressions biggest failings, the voice acting in it is pathetic and dull. I've seen baby's first video game with more interesting voice acting that this. If this is what an Act of Aggression sounds like I don't want to know what an Act of Boredom sounds like. What's more the awesome Live Action movies are completely missing; replaced instead with dull, unimaginative CoD 4 style exposition clips with stock images and videos. For a company who has sold many copies of its game previously it doesn't seem to want to reinvest that dosh in to making a good game. The story is clichéd but not in the semi-entertainingly campy way Act of War's story was but in the "I'm stopping after 4 missions level of bad". But enough about story let's move on to the meat of the game.\n\nThe Game play is dull and uninspired. Units move slowly and always prefer to lock to roadways which leads to unintuitive and clunky combat. This would be a problem in a game like CoH 2 where cover is important or C&C were positioning is important but oh no, we are playing Act of Aggression where units die so quickly that all that matters are numbers and spamming OP units and the hard counters to said OP units. I stand by my statement in saying that comparing it to C&C Generals is an insult to C&C Generals. C&C Generals may be old and may have similar design philosophies, but those philosophies are much better implemented. Very rarely will you not have a chance to react in C&C, if you make a mistake you can at least try to respond. Don't bother here you'll just die tired. Harassment a key component to Classic style strategy games is COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY DISCOURAGED due to the interesting but flawed prisoner capture system. This leads to combat being always massive engagements that last only about 5 seconds.\n\nThe map design is terrible. The maps are so large that even if harassment was encouraged you wouldn't bother because the maps are huge. You may think that this encourages manoeuvre but you'd be wrong as people enter a gentlemen's agreement to not spend another 10 minutes flanking over the 10 spent building up. What this leads to is a boring game with massive amounts of downtime. It is much easier to defend than attack - a common theme in Eugen games that leads to some really boring games. In the beta I had a game last for 2 hours because neither of us was willing to attempt to push, when I did I got annihilated by base defences. The game lacks the nuance of C&C Generals command abilities and so game play stagnates to stalemate due to the size of the maps.\n\nThe UI is terrible - something you have to see to believe. I'll try n link my video about it in but seriously placing your resource bar at the top of the screen is one of the dumbest UI choices I've seen in a RTS in ages.\n\nFinally it's economy. My god a more convoluted and unintuitive economy doesn't exist outside of Satan's hairy... you could call it a mini-game trying to figure out what unit does what and what is the ideal build order (it's spam tanks and AA tanks). Their are 3 resources you must collect however setting up the logistics train is boring and dull. You spend more time setting up for battle than fighting, but the setting up is CoH 2's minefield and killzone deployment or the careful positioning and dance of death that Generals has, no here you've got set up bloody resource buildings because macro is all that matters.\n\nIn my opinion Eugen doesn't have the talent to make a balanced game. CoH 2 and C&C Generals ain't perfect but if your thinking of replacing them with this game, keep looking. I would NOT recommend this game to anyone who has played a strategy game in the last 15 years because this game is stuck in the 90's without the fun of the campiness.\n\nFor those too lazy to read he's the same info dumped into a 12 minute rant on youtube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC5TqqZ6ECc","September 28, 2015","false","12.2"," 22 of 44 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","22","44","5","1"

I'm that gobsmacked.\n\nI'm struggling to grasp the fact that this is not an EA game.\n\nThe single player campaign has me reminiscing about Westwood's CnC (1995)\n\nI'm an old school DOS gamer and often (well, most of the time really) I'm pretty hard to please.\n\nAll the factions units can be upgraded making them useful against certain things. For instance the UN OP Chimera LAVs can be upgraded to have a medical "aura" making a couple LAVs with SAS troopers and Grenadiers hot dropped on the enemies position tons of fun for enemy soldiers and light vehicles.\n\nI like the mechanic of when the enemy is bunkered inside a building you can order your troops to clear the building. Various units have differing ways of doing it: UN soldiers enter the building and cool CQB gunfighting occurs and you can watch as the grunts take them out while they take out your grunts, SAS troopers have .50 M82A1;s and simply shoot them from the safety of long range and Grenadiers with their M19 lob 40mm death through the windows.. so much fun ;P\n\nAt present, I haven't played AoA in a multiplayer game as yet (since none of my friends have it at present), but I envisage it will be quite enjoyable (since I freaking love the single player campaign).\n\nAoA may seem like it has some rough edges, but thats what makes it endearing.\n\nOverall, AoA feels like I'm playing a new version of CnC Generals.\n\nAs it stands (without having played the MP component), I rate this game as 8/10\n\nFor the old school RTS-er out there, what are you waiting for?

The key differences (other than the obvious difference in factions, time periods, etc) are this:\n\n- The factions are far more diverse, and a little more well balanced, than Generals factions were.\n- The engine is, obviously, much better than Generals.  This is notable because, frankly, it looks as nice as anything ever done in any version of Frostbite (the engine that the scrapped Generals 2 was slated to use) but runs FAR better with WAY fewer lag spikes than Frostbite ever has.\n- The UI is practically hyrogliphic.  It takes freaking FOREVER to learn.  You will lose several "Easy" or 'Very Easy" Skirmish games simply because the UI is so damn cryptic that every action you try takes 10 times longer than it should.\n\nThat last part is really the only "con" this game has.  It is a good game, you just need to be prepared that it's going to take even veteran RTS or C&C players many, MANY hours to learn which picture on which button does what (and that's what you're gonna have to do - reading every word of text every time you play is suicide.)\n\nStill, I highly recommend the game.  The gaming space these days is replete with RTS games with population caps, no resource gathering, and a dozen other staples of C&C missing.  Act of Aggression has all the C&C features you want (without the ones from C&C4 that nobody ever wanted.)","December 11, 2015","true","49.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So here I am, doing quite the opposite, seeing this game getting so many bad reviews with comments that makes no sence for its criticism. This is an awesome game that I reccomend at its strongest!\n\nIMO this game is the BEST(!!!) RTS game ever released, and beeing a old school RTS gamer my favourites were the earliest of the C&C series, and the later ones such as Generals and Tiberium Wars, and SC1 was allways my childhood.\n\nThe guys with the bad and negative revies, you should all take a look here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=514651893\n\nThis game is much more complicated then your average RTS. The learning curve is steep, and I think thats the main reason for its negative feedback. In its earlier stage, people would join in a multiplayer game rather then play vs AI in a Skirmish game for their firs time, and its easy to see why these people will give up on a game and rage the hate for it.\n\n\nAnd another note, this game does NOT want to be another game then what it is. This is Act of Aggression, this is not Command & Conquer, this is not StarCraft. Simple as that, this is Act of Aggression, and if you love RTS, you will definitely love this game if you put some time into learing all its basic, as the learning curve might be pretty steep for newcomers (especially if you just jump straight into multiplayer and ignoring getting known with each and different units vs the AI, first).\n","September 16, 2015","true","701.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","1"

As an avid RTS-player (having played nearly everything from Dune2 to AoE to SC2 and everything in between), this one got me excited. The looks of the early screens made me drool and I honestly hoped that this wouldn't be blown off (looking at you EA...).\n\nFew weeks ago, closed beta ended and open beta opt-in was available for everyone that pre-ordered.\n\nThis game is SOLID! It has a high degree of polish and depth in the unit roster. The graphics are top-notch for an RTS-title (although I have to admit that 1080p falls somewhat short compared to the screenshots provided, but players ensured me that the 4K experience is the real deal, so now: up to saving some money ;) )\n\nThe Factions are all different in approach and how they take to the battlefield, but similar enough that you don't have to "relearn" the game just to play with another army. Each army has a myriad of units available, and each army focusses on a certain aspect of the battlefield. Find out for yourself ofcourse which army goes best with your preferred playstyle.\n\nHere's the review in numbers:\n\nGraphics: 8/10 (still waiting on that 4K to truly judge this)\nGameplay: 8.5/10\nReplayability: 8/10\n\nPros:\n- 3 different yet easy-to-switch-between factions\n- Huge unit roster\n- 4K optimised!\n- Ranked MP\n\nCons:\n- Rescource system takes some time getting used to\n- 1080p graphics do, sadly, not compare to the screenshots\n- some unit behaviour is clunky (mostly air)\n\nDo i recommend? Ofcourse. If you have any experience with C&C titles and want a similar game to take it into the year 2015 then this game is sure for you! Be warned though: this game is not a dumbed down moba. If you expect this one to play itself, go play something else.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GuardsmansGaming/recommended/318020/","GuardsmansGaming","Cadian Guardsman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GuardsmansGaming/","142 products in account","I've been playing Eugen System games since Act of War came out and while I was initially a fan I have to say that now I'm probably their biggest detractor. Infact I will humour you with my review of Act of Aggression taken straight from my practice script for a video I was going to to but turned into a 12 minute rant.\n\nAct of Aggression is a RTS that claims to be a return to the classical style of RTS. Many games have attempted to return to this classic style of RTS with the biggest highlight being the spectacular mismanagement of C&C Generals 2 by EA.\n\nLet me settle one thing first, Act of War and Wargame:European Escalation are some of my favourite games. Wargame was innovative and unique at the time of it release whereas Act of War was campy and fun. In these games we see the best that Eugen could do. Act of War, though fun was a C&C clone with all the failings and successes of C&C Generals. It had some interesting gimmicks that made it stand out from the group but on the whole it was a standard game backed up by solid voice acting and fun live action videos. I mention this because it is Act of Aggressions biggest failings, the voice acting in it is pathetic and dull. I've seen baby's first video game with more interesting voice acting that this. If this is what an Act of Aggression sounds like I don't want to know what an Act of Boredom sounds like. What's more the awesome Live Action movies are completely missing; replaced instead with dull, unimaginative CoD 4 style exposition clips with stock images and videos. For a company who has sold many copies of its game previously it doesn't seem to want to reinvest that dosh in to making a good game. The story is clichéd but not in the semi-entertainingly campy way Act of War's story was but in the "I'm stopping after 4 missions level of bad". But enough about story let's move on to the meat of the game.\n\nThe Game play is dull and uninspired. Units move slowly and always prefer to lock to roadways which leads to unintuitive and clunky combat. This would be a problem in a game like CoH 2 where cover is important or C&C were positioning is important but oh no, we are playing Act of Aggression where units die so quickly that all that matters are numbers and spamming OP units and the hard counters to said OP units. I stand by my statement in saying that comparing it to C&C Generals is an insult to C&C Generals. C&C Generals may be old and may have similar design philosophies, but those philosophies are much better implemented. Very rarely will you not have a chance to react in C&C, if you make a mistake you can at least try to respond. Don't bother here you'll just die tired. Harassment a key component to Classic style strategy games is COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY DISCOURAGED due to the interesting but flawed prisoner capture system. This leads to combat being always massive engagements that last only about 5 seconds.\n\nThe map design is terrible. The maps are so large that even if harassment was encouraged you wouldn't bother because the maps are huge. You may think that this encourages manoeuvre but you'd be wrong as people enter a gentlemen's agreement to not spend another 10 minutes flanking over the 10 spent building up. What this leads to is a boring game with massive amounts of downtime. It is much easier to defend than attack - a common theme in Eugen games that leads to some really boring games. In the beta I had a game last for 2 hours because neither of us was willing to attempt to push, when I did I got annihilated by base defences. The game lacks the nuance of C&C Generals command abilities and so game play stagnates to stalemate due to the size of the maps.\n\nThe UI is terrible - something you have to see to believe. I'll try n link my video about it in but seriously placing your resource bar at the top of the screen is one of the dumbest UI choices I've seen in a RTS in ages.\n\nFinally it's economy. My god a more convoluted and unintuitive economy doesn't exist outside of Satan's hairy... you could call it a mini-game trying to figure out what unit does what and what is the ideal build order (it's spam tanks and AA tanks). Their are 3 resources you must collect however setting up the logistics train is boring and dull. You spend more time setting up for battle than fighting, but the setting up is CoH 2's minefield and killzone deployment or the careful positioning and dance of death that Generals has, no here you've got set up bloody resource buildings because macro is all that matters.\n\nIn my opinion Eugen doesn't have the talent to make a balanced game. CoH 2 and C&C Generals ain't perfect but if your thinking of replacing them with this game, keep looking. I would NOT recommend this game to anyone who has played a strategy game in the last 15 years because this game is stuck in the 90's without the fun of the campiness.\n\nFor those too lazy to read he's the same info dumped into a 12 minute rant on youtube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC5TqqZ6ECc","September 28, 2015","false","12.2"," 22 of 44 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","22","44","5","1"

I'm that gobsmacked.\n\nI'm struggling to grasp the fact that this is not an EA game.\n\nThe single player campaign has me reminiscing about Westwood's CnC (1995)\n\nI'm an old school DOS gamer and often (well, most of the time really) I'm pretty hard to please.\n\nAll the factions units can be upgraded making them useful against certain things. For instance the UN OP Chimera LAVs can be upgraded to have a medical "aura" making a couple LAVs with SAS troopers and Grenadiers hot dropped on the enemies position tons of fun for enemy soldiers and light vehicles.\n\nI like the mechanic of when the enemy is bunkered inside a building you can order your troops to clear the building. Various units have differing ways of doing it: UN soldiers enter the building and cool CQB gunfighting occurs and you can watch as the grunts take them out while they take out your grunts, SAS troopers have .50 M82A1;s and simply shoot them from the safety of long range and Grenadiers with their M19 lob 40mm death through the windows.. so much fun ;P\n\nAt present, I haven't played AoA in a multiplayer game as yet (since none of my friends have it at present), but I envisage it will be quite enjoyable (since I freaking love the single player campaign).\n\nAoA may seem like it has some rough edges, but thats what makes it endearing.\n\nOverall, AoA feels like I'm playing a new version of CnC Generals.\n\nAs it stands (without having played the MP component), I rate this game as 8/10\n\nFor the old school RTS-er out there, what are you waiting for?

However, in the 5+ hours I have had in-engine I have had the time of my life. This game holds more than many of the negatives (though some of them have valid points) give credit. Yes it's buggy. Yes there is no tutorial, etc etc. But this game with its three unique factions, dynamic resource system, the impressive scale of the maps, everything about this speaks of the old RTS hailing from the days where base-building was fun and a major part of gameplay, not the stale and repetative capture-the-flag-style garbage it has become in some instances.\n\nI give this game a solid Yes in recomendation because thus far, though it needs some serious polish and some tweaks in balance and what-not, it is a fun and in my experience, enjoyable gem that brings me back to even my Red Alert 2 and C&C Generals Zero Hour days of which I dumped countless hours of time into because it was enjoyable. And now, with this game's impressive scale, challenging AI, and a decent pool of maps and commendable multiplayer (at least with buddies), I think this game deserves more than a "Mixed" review.\n\nTL;DR - This game has its share of bugs, balance issues and a steep learning curve due to lack of a tutorial, but it is an enjoyable gem despite these shortcomings, and is worth the purchase if on sale.","February 10","true","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Like you cant just walk through cars and fences and you cant walk down steep cliffs and make it look like there is nothing.. or did you just forget about that?\n\nOk, I mean the Wargame series did not focus on singleplayer at all, but the Act of War series did, at least Direct Action and it was a beauty of an RTS game, especially when considering the time it was developed in. It was miles ahead of any other game and now suddenly you bring out a game thats miles and miles behind. It feels like evolution for you means coming from modern times heading for the stoneage. Yes, Im really annoyed, because this game has alot of potential. I mean look at the Men of War series and how their games are getting better and better and there is a simple reason for that: They care what their players say and they let them take part and I mean all players, not only those multiplayer junks, but also those singleplayer junks. Its worth it.\n\nGreat you realized it and made another version to switch to, but what for? You didnt change anything, you just took stuff away and made it even more simple, considering that it has been a very simple game from the beginning.. are you even playing your games? Who is testing your games? Do those people even know what they are talking about? Have they played RTS games before? 45€? What the hell man..\n\nMy suggestion: Bring back the devs of AoW DA and google the words physics, gravitation and material and why you cant just walk through it and why you may fall off a cliff when its too steep.\n\nAnyways, sometimes this game is fun to play, whenever you feel like getting frustrated.. thank you.\n\nStill this blue thumb goes up, because I want you to try again.","March 31","true","37.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Mortar teams, snipers, anti tank infantry plus a suite of air and ground transport. Tanks, artillery and smoke offer support.  In the air, bombers and  air cover streak across the map dealing shocking strikes to land units below and to the menacing helos that roam the map looking for stragglers.\n\nThe Reboot edition is a free update to the game. Players now can have multiple builders rapidly developing infrastructure independently. Play the multi resource original or the fast paced Reboot , you will have a game that the developers constantly improve. The passion that the developers have for this game shines through.\n\nAn Act of Aggression 2 would be an instant buy. I had already had well worth my money, 340 hours in game.

I liked it from the get-go, but gameplay was also complicated and frustrating at the beginning. The AI is pretty decent here - it will hit you at different points and is really strong economically and pushes out units. After playing between 1-2 dozen games in skirmish (same map), this is my first or second game to defeat the normal AI. Winning will require some careful thought in my experience.\n\nThe Reboot version makes all the difference. Before, this was a solid RTS but frustrating to play in terms of mechanics. The new streamlined mechanics help you to concentrate on strategy and combat, but base building is by no means neglected. In fact, all levels - unit production, strategy/tactics, base building, research, unit upgrades - work together very well. Some things could be ironed out. but it feels more like minor details now. Changes to unit roster are also very welcome - at least from what I've seen so far.\n\nThis title still won't be everyone's thing. But in addition to the things mentioned above, a lot more is in the right place - pace and flow, graphics, performance. It's a superb way to kill 45 minutes and a lot more exciting than a good deal of the major competition.","April 6","true","17.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I was expecting a C&C Generals-like experience, but what I got was a bland and poorly designed RTS.  Factions lack diversity, units feel weak unless grouped en-masse, and it was very hard for me to tell what units were in combat where.  It's like a cross between a traditional RTS and Wargame Red Dragon, but it fails to bring out the strengths of either.\n\nOne of the game's biggest shortcomings is base construction/management.  Resource collection requires constant, tedious micromanagement, with refineries having to be constantly bought/sold.  And the inclusion of THREE resource types can result in your attention being overstretched, especially in the mid/late game.  Many buildings are redundant, and fulfill the exact same functions as other buildings.  Bases become very large as well, becoming impossible to defend.\n\nTherefore I cannot recommend this game, and have refunded my copy.

To be far it is still marked as beta so that can tend to happen. On the brighstside I think the original game is well worth the price that is currently being charged on here. It is a great classic RTS game with a few quirks that the reboot will eventually address. I think the fact that there is even a reboot edition at all let alone that it is free for current owners deserves some applause to the devloper.

Unfortunately, the expectation didn't outlive the actual gameplay... While the game follows previous series of 'Act of War', I do not see the fun that used to exist in AOW.\n\nAlthough units are new and futuristic, I can't see how cool they are when they die too fast... Honestly, units are SLAUGHTERED during single player. I've seen some bizzare splash damanges where more than dozens of choppers got killed in less than 5 seconds by a few rockets(I'm not even sure if this was even a rocket... What kind of weapon could have such horrible splash damage? ). As some of your objectives is to keep some units alive (i.e. Exosoldiers), you realize that they die so terribly fast and it eventually becomes a frustration. Not that I don't respect the developer's intention to make single player hard, but it's just not fun anymore.\n\nI've played a few games by Eugen, and I seriously LOVE Wargame series. I know the single player in that game was horribly hard too. But the game's pace wasn't this fast in Wargame. Also, the units have realistic range/weapons which does not kill the enemy instantly (except tank vs. light armor). The game tries to be arcade but its objectives are RTS... I remember AOW was more focused on the arcade (I don't remember getting any SF guys killed during single player in AOW or its sequel high treason). Now my only hope is that the developers release a patch to somehow balance this...","September 5, 2015","false","18.9"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","11","23","0","0"

Action is fast paced and it looks beautiful if you can run it on ultra. Factions are different and interesting. US Army is slow to build up and has a traditional building style and resource gathering (dump trucks), The cartel has helicopters that deliver resources and a helicopter as a recon unit(to discover resources). I said earlier how action is fast paced, but I feel like its a bit too quick. Resource gathering is slow and tedious and 90% of the time even if you have 4 oil factories and 2 banks. Infantry is pretty much non existant after 15 minutes into the game. There are plenty of defenses, however I feel this game would benefit from a wall and gate mechanic. It doesnt seem like a true base builder when tanks can just steam roll pass your turrents. Theres pretty much no such thing as turtling especially due to instant game enders like nukes. That being said this game is pretty fun and I recommend it to any casual or hardcore rts fan.","September 4, 2015","true","12.0"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","0"

It also plays good as well, having units move slower when offroad, and faster on the road, each faction is unique and has quite a nice selection of units to play around with.\n\nBut this game is not without its problems, all games have this. For one, the infantry die way too quickly in campaign. I understand when you are fighting tanks and such, infantry should be quickly dying for rushing fast into something they should not fight, but, in this example, the first mission of the game. You have only infantry units and you are fighting enemy infantry; your only secondary objective is don't lose any infantry. Which is really difficult when you lose seven of the ten you are given. There is no cover on this map, so they can easily die.\n\nAnother struggling point about this game is the fact, there is no tutorial or clues on what the heck you are doing. If you were a new player to the genre, you would not enjoy this game unless you dived into solo-player skrimish mode with no enemies, just to learn the basics. Other than this, the game is mostly fine. Needs a lot of tender love and care in patch fixes and updates, and since the devs are aware of the issues, we should see this in the future.\n\nPROS:\n- Classic RTS Vibe\n- 3 Unique Factions\n- Looks and feels good.\n\nCONS:\n- No Tutorial\n- Unbalanced Moments\n- Buggy Situations where the game softlocks [A state where you can still play the game, but nothing updates or works. You can still command units, but no enemies spawn nor you can build anything.

This RTS will challenge even the best RTS players out there as every unit has it's useful bits and it's down falls.  Micromanagement is key to being successful in this game.  The counters for different units can force you into building tiered military groupings.  Stacking one type of unit will literally be your downfall as you can be easy countered.  But a well built military groupings can counter and take the battlefield.  The 3 very distinctive factions are vastly different offerings each has its own strategies for success and weaknesses.  This could be one of the hardest RTS's I have ever played but well worth the learning curve.  The only downfall is at this point not a lot of people are playing the game leaving the online multiplayer with other human players to be desired.","September 23, 2015","true","48.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

It is definitely done in a tasteful way, however. It's all the mechanics and micromanagement emphasis that made C&C great, the mechanics that set it apart in a meaningful way from Starcraft 2. What I mean is in Starcraft there is a most efficient way for every race and situation and the game becomes a battle of who can execute the tightest build order. Of course in a mathematical sense this is subject to that same rule, but the room for creativity is massive. I found myself thinking up fun little strategies to keep my opponent on his toes, and it worked in a meaningful way and was therefore rewarding.\n\nI can see myself playing this game for many years.

Every time I start the game it auto detects my graphics settings, which is a painful course of watching the same 10 second simulation of combat over and over again as the game generates and benchmarks settings for me (I have an alienware laptop) and starts to choke up and slow down near the last 3 sims.  Very unoptimized graphics IMO , and with the endless list of video settings you have to toy around with it for a while.  I take performance over quality, and with high settings on a GTX 765M I have choppy lag spikes every time I zoom out on the battlefield.  The low settings are pretty unexcusable for 2015, if you turn down the terrain detail it looks like an overly zoomed in color gradient.\n\n\nThe campaign is essentially a stretched out tutorial, which all of the cutscenes made me cringe terribly.  The dialog is slow and drawn out, where the news reporter in each instance is talking like english is their second language, and theres no premise or explanation as to why what is happening, so if you dont do your research on the backstory of the game youre going to be ♥♥♥♥ing lost.  All of the tactical/strategic lingo sounds like a group of 10 year olds making up things as they go along, expect to shake your head when the actors try to talk 'military' over the radio to eachother.  Each mission throws you a couple more unit types at a time until you "beat the campaign" which at that point you now know how to play the game.\n\nAs for the gameplay:\n\n1v1 maps are enourmous and largely lifeless/uninhabited, you have to hike over a minute to get to the other players base , I havent even tried anything larger than that, and get frustrated when the game beats me in the rock paper scissors combat style.  It definitely feels uneventful, almost like having a girlfriend doing the whole dead fish thing.  You can play as the US Army, which inside their barracks makes ♥♥♥♥ing Marines (im sorry i had a hard time with that one) and the other factions have fantasy weapons.\n\nAI is terrible, im not talking about the opponent, im talking about the individual units.  It feels like they are literally taking turns at eachother shooting, nearly turn based, and just doesnt feel like combat.  Unit advantages/disadvantages are rock paper scissors , theres no diversity to the combat and I feel like the units are ridiculously close when they engage eachother.\n\nThey introduced three types of ♥♥♥♥ing stupid income, where you have to find aluminum and oil and rare minerals and stupid ♥♥♥♥, so you have to have a certain amount of each type and build multiple ♥♥♥♥ing refineries because you find them in groups all over the place, and then sell them 3 minutes later when they run dry.  So instead of focusing on combat youre trying to find an ingredient list of ♥♥♥♥ to build a base that loses its luster fairly quickly.  In zero hour, you had a linear and simple form of resources, which brought your focus onto the actual combat which is fun.  None of this complicated BS.\n\nI hate this ♥♥♥♥ing game, and if you have respect for CnC you wont buy it either.  The only comparison to the game is theres bullets and missiles in it as well as a modern theme.","September 5, 2015","false","1.4"," 57 of 116 people (49%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","49","57","116","9","4"

The Act of war series is definitely  a serious contender for the C&C crown here, but as americans would say "here is where it's at" and In my opinion the graphics gameplay and content pretty much sum up Act of Aggression  as the next generation of C&C if I can call it that. The reboot edition that you get as a "patch" or add on gives the game the "old school" feel but the original version which uses 3 resources is in my view by far the best and not only gives the game a "real world" approach to resource management but adds that special "next generation of resource managed warfare" feel.

For the most part, I like and trust Eugen to make good games.

There is extremely effective base defences to shoot down SW so you can if you decide to camp in base. The general defences you can deploy are really effective which means that breaking through them can be a struggle but is possible. To be perfectly honest if the developers let you zoom out further to better co-ordinate your forces as I tend to just play the game in "Satalite View" and if YOU turn off Super Weapons then you will find a much better gaming experience.","October 19, 2015","true","36.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The upgrades on units and buildings were far from easy to understand and in a way poorly laid out.\n\nBut after spending sometime looking at tutorials and getting a hang of the UI, the game started to pull me in...  Now I must say honestly worth the steep learning curve, I have had some big fun battles and I must say it has been a lot of fun.\n\nStill learning units, tactics etc for this game but certainly worth trying out.  Maybe look at a tutorial or two before buying to be sure it suits you. If they redesign the UI, I think the game would have a much bigger following.\n\nMy likes:  Diverse tactics, Very pretty graphics, great maps, destructible environments, decent unit range...\n\nMy main dislikes:  UI is really poor, badly designed naming, icons, font and font colour.  .. really crappy job here.   The info is all there its just laid out very poorly.  It wouldnt take much to get this sorted\n\nI dont like the resource system, but thats a just a personal preference - I can understand some of the design choices behind it but juggling 3 resources, as well as storage for these can get a bit annoying.  Finally the air force control is very clunky and almost feels like it was something they forgot and added later..","October 5, 2015","true","23.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Anyway - thats never a bad thing. HAs all the best bits of Eugen's Act of War too - which aside from the win7 memory bug was a game worth playing.\n\nExtremely well balanced with the best bits from 'War Game' family (same engine I believe) with the base building fun of Act of War and similar RTS's. Each race has distinct skills and weaknesses that add to an interesting gameplay mechanic. Even the smaller units have their benefits in some circumstances. Nice to see a game where orbital weapons can be deflected for a change, instead of being game enders.\n\nEven the single player campaigns have a good level of learning and that addictive 'I can do that better and more efficiently if I just...' replay value. I seriously spent 10 hours eeking around the last level with only one resource trying to claw back some dignity from an early aggressive AI onslaught - not many games keep me enthraled that long these days. And I did win in the end with some cheap units in the right places. It's not always a race to the big guns!\n\nPros:\nClean Graphics\nRock Steady (no real bugs found other than those that have been fixed)\nCheesy - but knows it is and cheeses in bucket loads\nNice engine with drone cam style overhead view when zoomed out\nNo real lag  - even in huge complex battles on my laptop\nDecent music and effects\nGood learning curve that progresses to challenging\nDecent Single Player Campaigns (that are hard to complete to 100% objectives)\n\nCons (nit-picking really)\nSome realism with building weapon paths would help - some line of fire is a bit suspect.\nYou often drive over obstacles that simply disintegrate - would be nice for walls to fall over in the direction they should, or shipping containers to get crushed by tanks rather than just collapse.\nI really want my troops to swing from the troop carriers on to buildings, but they just appear on the floor.\n\nGraphics/ Art 8/10\nIn general its the 'missing' animations that make this game not 10 out of 10 for graphics and don't give it that polished C&C feel, but then again the terrain is more realistic and some of the maps are HUGE with literally hundreds of buildings - all of which you can enter so that adds an extra dynamic. Think largest map in C&C then multiply it by 16. Its this that keeps it at 9/10, but then minus 1 for the cutscenes as you can never beat C&C cheese acting or war babes.\n\nSound / FX 8/10\nCheesy as they come, and a few stolen film quotations for good measure - repetitive but name me an RTS that isn't. Music is good enough to hum to as you get used to it...\n\nPlayability / Lastability 8/10\nI keep coming back to beat the clock or kill more units on a level and nothing has had my attention this much since Sins of a Solar Empire. Just 3 more attempts.\n\nValue for money 10/10\nAny game I play for more than 50 hours is good value for £30. I will still be playing this for a while yet...\n\nOverall 8/10\nA good old skool RTS with some nice new elements thrown in. Looks like a next gen RTS with bigger maps, large unit counts and good diversity, without losing the old skool feel like Planetary Annihilation did.  If it was a bit more polished and had better cut scenes with acting it would get 10/10, but that really does not distract from the RTS gameplay either too much so it doesn't seem fair to drop it for this but I have too. All in all this is one of the best RTS's out there right now and I am almost ashamed that for whatever reasons I only stumbled on it by accident. Come on Steam - push this a bit more!!!\n\n\n","October 5, 2015","true","93.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It is a throwback to the goldenage of the RTS genre. The gameplay is a mix of macro and micro(Though units have some lag currently, making micro abit of a pain in the butt at this time, but i have faith that will be fixed). The basic premise is pretty simple, its abit of a futuristic type RTS with three unique factions. Basic units are various infantry, vehicles, tanks, planes, copters, nukes ,etc. It does remind me of CnC Generals in a good way!\nLet us start off with the Cons: There is some lag in the units making it hard to micro.\nAbit of a steep curve that nonRTS vets may be turned off abit by.\nThe solo is abit bland at times and the voice acting isnt the best...\nMost other issues have been addressed, or been patched already so i am confident in it being up to par in the future!\nThe Pros: GoldenAge RTS that feels right in this day and age.\nEach faction is unique\nFun concepts taken from various games all mixed together to create something amazing.\nThe competitiveness of it is quite fun. Zerging, turtling, the techers, etc. Each of the old strats are well and full in play here and have ways to beat each.\nEach unit has a use. Though some are very specific they all come in handy at somepoint!\nThis game is truly enjoyable to me as an old school RTS fan. I would suggest it to anyone wanting to remember and enjoy the goldenage feel of the RTS genre. Yes the pricetag may be abit steep but...is that such a bad thing for a game/genre that does not see much love these days?","October 4, 2015","true","14.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The three resources kind of, muddied the waters a bit. It was an added challenge. Having grown up on Command and Conquer, Red Alert and the like, it made the transition somewhat difficult.\nThree resources were good in Age Of Empires.

The graphics are great, the factions are wonderful, the units were varied and useful, but there was something missing.\n\nNow however, with the reboot edition with only one resource instead of three, its a much smoother game. The three resources kind of, muddied the waters a bit. It was an added challenge. Having grown up on Command and Conquer, Red Alert and the like, it made the transition somewhat difficult.\nThree resources were good in Age Of Empires. Where you didn't have to overly worry about supply lines. Again, a bit more of a challenge.  I think the triple resources could've come later to add another dimention to the gameplay for gamers who may have felt a bit more of a challenge was needed.\n\nAll in all, yes.

No, not in its present state.\nIs it a good game? Hell yes, and you should buy it.\n\nPros:\n- Good graphics\n- Gameplay is awesome, some analogies to Command and Conquer: Generals I've seen are dead on\n- Interesting story\n\nMy major gripe with this game is that it feels unpolished, which is why I don't feel it's worth $45 bucks (maybe ~$25 if that). You're not given a whole lot of direction or information about how to use your troops, their abilities if any, and so on at the beginning of the game - you're a little bit left to figure it out on your own. It's not hard, but other RTS games have definitely done this much better.\n\nAnd the voice acting, WOW. terribad. It's a great touch that the publisher added characters and acting to make the story come together, but damn, I wish they'd have called me for one of the roles, I gauran-damn-tee you I'd put the voice actors I've heard so far (the Chimera ones) to shame without so much as trying.\n\nAll that said?

Beyond that they seem to spawn in chunks at certain locations, so even if you don't know what resource is where, you can always have an idea where to look.\n\nUnits are pretty responsive and are fairly straightforward, for the most part.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty cool. From the sounds of things, they've tried to channel some of Frank Klepacki's rock music from the C&C series. Your mileage may vary whether they've succeeded.\n\nThe biggest issue for new players is the total lack of tutorial. The game does not teach you how to play, which units are best against which, or how to use them. Starting an AI Skirmish match against a Very Easy AI can be surprisingly challenging. It took me several tries to discover that buildings are built from the Headquarters itself, not a worker unit (the HQ spawns a worker unit when the building is "completed" - which then runs to the building spot).\n\nThis may sound minor, but it's actually a rather big deal. The unit quotations and voice acting are very stilted and weak. All the recon units pretty much share the same quotes, just recited by different actresses/actor. This contrasts very sharply with the colourful, sometimes humourous quotes of Company of Heroes. Or take a look at StarCraft - there's a reason that "You must construct additional pylons", "You require more vespene gas", and "SCV good to go, sir!" are all remembered to this day.\n\nSo overall, pretty good. A few minor things let it down, but a pretty good thing nonetheless.\n\nBut what does it say about a game when the most I can say is "It's pretty good" when it demands $50 CAD...?\n","September 13, 2015","true","47.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

With RTS games I generally prefer the base building and resource gathering elements over the combat. While Act of Aggression has both base building and resource gathering, combat is the key component in the game.\n\nThe one thing I have never been a big fan of with combat in RTS games is that you usually have to be good at the tactical strategy elements of combat. You need the right set of troops in the correct layout or you will die. I generally prefer RTS games where you can still do well if you have a large enough army. You can't do that in Act of Aggression though. If you don't have the right attack plan and the right troops your whole army can be wiped out in less than a minute.\n\nIf you don't like RTS games you won't like Act of Aggression. If you like RTS games but prefer the base building/resource gathering like me, I would recommend waiting for a sale. If you really like tactical combat though I think you will really like Act of Aggression.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of Act of Aggression.

Heres my take on those. 1. Who plays an RTS game for the campaign? RTS games are meant to be played for skirmish mode against other people. Play an RPG if you like campaigns. 2. They'll fine tune the faction balance issues just like every other game has. 3. For being too basic, really? Aren't you tired of all the gimmicky features most of these newer games are pushing?  4. Read the RECOMMENDED system requirements before you purchase a game. Don't give bad reviews to a game because your rig sucks.  I have played Age of Empires, C&C series, Supreme Commander, Rise of Nations, etc. With that being said, Act of Aggression is a great addition to the genre. A good analogy for this game would be Command & Conquer in the Wargame series' game engine. What makes this game different from Command & Conquer though? Map sizes are much larger, meaning that games last longer and require more long term planning to take strategic focal points on the map. The economics is also different in the fact that if you do not plan gathering,  purchases, and research wisely, you will really shoot yourself in the foot. One thing that was great about Command & Conquere were the unique playstyles for each faction. I feel that Act of Aggression also delivers this. Each faction has their stregnths, weaknesses and optimal playing style. Aside from the core mechanics, the visual effects are the best I have seen since Surpreme Commander 1. Blowing up units and buildings will result in brilliant flashes and explosions. The only real drawback for me was the music. I think the developers were going for the C&C sound, but the result was a bit corny. Atleast they tried. Anyways, this is your BASIC RTS game meant to be played in skirmish mode like a real RTS game should be played. No gimmicks here. Act of War Delivers on a solid RTS experience, not an RPG one. For this, I give the game a 9/10.","September 6, 2015","true","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sikwittid/recommended/318020/","sikwittid","Sikwittid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sikwittid/","76 products in account","I've been interested in this game for a while now, and bought it on a steam sale. I'm a big fan of RTS games. More specifically the Command and Conquer franchise, both the Westwood and EA variety. I have wanted to try some of Eugen Systems “Wargame” franchise, but have been very cautious. As I've played a similar game called World in Conflict. Although the strategy element is there, the game looks gorgeous, and there are very strong and refreshing elements to the strategy of games like these. I prefer base building RTS games. Which leads me to my review.\n\nAfter a few hours of playing I’ve notice the core game play, as well as the varied strategy the game offers. Which I must say is very deep and involved. This game lives up to the standards of old RTS games, and is no push over. Although I didn't like the game at first, as I was more used to the fast paced game play of the recent RTS titles. I took a step back and began to look at it with a keen eye. This game nods its hat to the old “slower” style of RTS games of the past. There are some serious macro, micro, and meticulous resource management within this game. Somehow it keeps up the pace very well and you will find yourself spending hours in skirmish trying to find the best flow for your build to take into multilayer.\n\nEach of the three factions play very differently. You have the US with their shear brute force, the Chimera faction with its fast paced hit and run tactics, and the Cartel with their high tech and stealth technology. You know, basic RTS factions here. I quickly favored the US, as spreading across the map gobbling up resources, and zerging M1 Abrams will almost guarantee a victory on the ground. I have yet to do anything worthwhile with the Chimera, but I know they have some serious potential. They’re just “not my cup of tea”.  The Cartel have been very interesting, and their tanks can most certainly hold their own against the Abrams. I have grown to like each faction. Beyond ground warfare you also have Air to Air, and Air to Ground via, planes, bombers, helicopters, and even super weapons, as well as counter super weapons. There is an answer to everything. A real rock, paper, scissors RTS game. It feels very fresh and rewarding either way you play. As variety is the spice of life as so is it in an RTS game, and there is so much variety to be had.\n\nWith that said I can't really place this game on one side of the spectrum. I'd have to place it in its own category. An Old/New type of category. It's not Starcraft, or Command and Conquer, but so far it's been very well made.\n\nMy favorite game play mechanic, as you may have picked up from my review, is the “tank control”. I absolutely love an RTS game with great tank control. It's something you have to try for yourself.\n\nMy biggest gripe so far has to be the strange lag the game has when you order your units, it does take away from the experience a little. Again something you'd have to try to see for yourself. If you select a unit and order it to move, attack, enter a building. There is a millisecond or two of lag. Either its intentional or unintentional I do not know.","December 27, 2015","true","25.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The only place the game succeeds in is in its graphics. There are no innovations to this game. The same UI, the same buttons, the same playstyle as all the old Command and Conquer games. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that the campaign is so aweful I quit playing it after the third mission was easily blown through. The missions don't challenge you at all. You don't have to do any more than simply click attack move and click on where the objective is on the minimap. On top of that, the US does not have a campaign of its own. Given the description of the US in the game's site (old, out of date) and you get the feeling that the developers actually don't like the US faction at all. All in all the game in bland, with only the graphics making it interesting for the first few minutes. There are a few 'oo ah' moments, but if you want good gameplay, go back and play Command and Conquer Generals. You'll have a better time.","September 2, 2015","false","2.0"," 46 of 94 people (49%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","49","46","94","7","6"

For starters, this game has three different factions with different styles of playing. The devs have definitely nailed down the "uniqeness" of each faction and they have also excelled at adding a wide variety of units...not to mention superweapons.\n\nMy major issue with this game however is it's nothing like what players say, stuff like "sequel to C&C generals"" or "C&C as it should have been". I have been a hardcore fan of C&C games (especially generals) and I have to say this feels nothing like it. The game's economy is fairly easy to understand but feels rather slow. The limitations to build areas makes it a pain to keep expanding. I havent played online that much but games felt really boring, campaign looks polished but it also felt really boring.\n\nSo I give this game a thumbs down (for now), maybe with updates this game will be more interesting to play. For those reading this review please don't try and comment "look how many hours he has played", just read the review first and you will understand that I am bored with this game to the extent I don't really feel like playing it atm.","September 8, 2015","false","9.7"," 17 of 36 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","17","36","0","6"

I don't understand what's the point in having individual soldiers of this size: you can't understand who is who, you can't manage them, you can't pick them like you know whom you're picking, you can only mass a few of them and send them die without any strategy whatsoever.\n\nToo much talking, so let's finalize.\nI consider this game is in Alpha mode and developers are still trying to see what this game is going to be. Maybe in a few months we get to see another game, which won't have all these massive problems/failures.\nOtherwise, if Eugen thinks this is the final product, maybe they should refund all of us, or, at least, give us a complimentary copy of their next really finalised game.

Once in a while I will play a game against A.I then get over it. The multiplayer aspect of this game died very quickly and there very few multiplayer games, those few are filled with veterans, so its not really new player friendly, but then again what multiplayer game based on killing the other guys is noob friendly.\n\nIn short I hope eugen learn from this and improve things in the future through a expansion or new version of the game.","November 7, 2015","false","107.1"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","10","22","0","1"

Not only because it was billed as a spiritual successor to C&C Generals, but I also because I just paid $40 for it. If you enjoy being short on resources and constantly having to manage and plan your expenses, you may like this game. If you prefer the old school style of resource management ala Warcraft, AOE, C&C, I would probably stay away from this game. Still, I determing I was going to give this game a shot. I loaded up a 1 vs 1 AI skirmish on very easy. This gave me time to play around with the buildings, upgrades, and units. After about an hour of playing I was feeling pretty comfortable with the game so I decided to go seek out the AI and do some damage. I put together a small army of about 8 attack helicopters, 20 marines, 4 heavy tanks, 2 heavy artillery, 3 heavy missile launchers, and a mix of 10 light armor consisting of mortar launcher, anti-tank, and anti-air unit. For my first contact, I encounter an enemy force consisting of 2 helicopters, 2 light mortar launcher, and about 4 mixed light armor. I sent my units in expecting a quick victory. There were a bunch of explosions and, after about 5 seconds, the smoke cleared. I had won and I was left with 2 badly damaged helicopters, and my heavy artillery, which had held back to firing range. 2 helicopters and a handful of light armor had completely obliterated a force that outnumbered and outgunned them in every way conceivable. I can forgive a game that forces you to carefully manage your resources but I can't forgive a game that then vaporizes your resources in the most nonsensical and asnine way possible. After about 3 hours of total game time, Act of Aggression is now uninstalled.","September 4, 2015","false","4.9"," 40 of 83 people (48%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","48","40","83","8","3"

Some mechanics work better than AoW, but some are just silly. Some are just plain missing. I don't like the lack of veterancy and how I can't station infantry on top of buildings. It's something new to get used to. The 3 resources is too much to micromanage. The music is awful. Very awful. Holy crap it's bad. I loved the music from AoW, which very much added to the atmosphere. That escalating theme as the action increases. In Act of Agression, the music sounds, and feels like, a mobile game trying too hard. I'll keep playing, but ill probably end up back at AoW. Some are pointing out that this is the spiritual successor to C&C generals, and not Act of War. It could just be ignorance on their part, or the truth. I hated Generals. Overall it's not $60 and it still contains classic RTS elements, so out of the two choices, but I'll say don't recommend since "meh" isn't an option.","September 4, 2015","false","2.5"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","9","20","0","0"

I really want to like this game, I really do. But the animations are not polished at all, the emphasis on resource gathering is way too high and the story line is just a bunch of stock photos of people in a newsreel format. R.U.S.E's storyline had fully animated people and a more indepth idea. This game's missions seems shallow, linear and repetitive.\n\nSkirmishes on the other hand are quite nice to play once you learn where the resources on the map are and once you get the hang of it. The game has a very steep learning curve to expect to be absolutely crushed by an easy or medium enemy in your first few skirmishes.\n\nThe game does not seem too well optimised though. I'm running two GTX 970s in SLI and the framerate rarely goes above 40fps, and that's with AA turned off. I think it might be an SLI issue so people in single cards might have a better experience? Either way I'm waiting for a patch to fix it.\n\nI would love to recommend this game, but it just feels too clunky in its current state and the story if just too linear. The animations and visuals need polishing off as well, the videos on the store page make the game look a lot better than it actually is.\nI can live with the story being crappy as the real replay value comes from multiplayer and skirmishes, but until the visuals are polished off, and some of the units are better balanced and there is less resource gathering emphasis, I cannot recommend this game.","September 9, 2015","false","13.0"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","2"

This game is just Wargame: Red Dragon just with two extra annoying ♥♥♥ currencies and just forcing you to build your units from structures with a few more or less useless upgrades from other structures. If you are a C&C fan DO NOT get this game, it lacks any of the intuitive control and ease of play as well as making the base building a chore rather than an important part of your game other than building a lot of refineries and spending any resources you get on units with an occasional upgrade. If you are a Wargame fan it'll be an alright game, but the great reducting in realism from regular Wargame will bother some. Do not try to play turtle, you will run out of resources before you can even build defenses. Defensive structures suck and can't actually defend themselves other than just soak up a bit of damage for an attacking force as well as too difficult to deploy effectively. The only real thing they can defend against is aircraft, but those defenses themselves are too expensive. From an econmic standpoint, the 3 resource gameplay is out of place and difficult to manage or aquire for a supposed fast-paced RTS. Other much slower RTS games, such as Age of Empires can handily use the multiple resource system since it gives you plenty of time to manage and coordinate your efforts, as well as cheats allowing single-player games to be much more enjoyable. In fast-paced RTS all the system does is provide stress as you try to balance trying to get the resources. The fact that two of the three resources are nonrenewable, once you take them from the map and use them on units, upgrades, or buildings, they're gone forever. However, each faction has structures that can renewable replace all 3 resources, but they don't produce them fast enough to meet demand, therefore it is technically and scientifically speaking, nonrenewable. It's this system that bothers me the most from the entire game, it isolates and weakens players in the late game as well as making the game incredibly boring since you can only use a few units. More than half of all the units you can deploy become unattainable as well as the storage buildings you are forced to deploy become useless and just padding for your base. The late game become agonizingly slow as they both sides try to finish off the other players with what units they have left. The lack of feedback to the status of your troops due to the extremely zoomed out engine and lack of noticable unit markers on the mini-map or the main interface. However, one good thing about the game is the variety of upgrades, despite the lack of noticable gain from using them. Unlike Wargame, there is no turn-based strategy campaigns you can play and you just play cheesy missions as either the Chimera or Cartel. I do know that a lot of people do enjoy this game and a lot of them play C&C games, but I think that they can adapt to the new system due to their playstyles (aggresive, punishing), I am not one of them, since I like to play as an expensive turtle that tries to take as much as the map as possible before fortifying the lines. You cannot do that with this game. The A.I. system in both this game and Wargame is completely unpredictible, medium and easy difficulties can actually be more difficult to play against than hard or very hard. I think something in the unit attack A.I. is at fault. The soundtrack leaves something to be desired. You remember that fantastic C&C: Generals soundtrack that was different depending on your faction and that musi related to the faction. The GLA had upbeat Arabian music, the US had hardcore badass rock and roll, and the Chinese had a tradational percussion-woodwind soundtrack. This game has some sleasy rock for awhile then it goes into some generic techno crap that sounded like it repeated itself again in 20 seonds. This review is already too long.

Good thing too, only exception may be the music, is generic modern stuff, is not the worst, but i really dont like it much, is a constant loop over the game, i preferred Act of War music, it was situational, but is not a big factor.\n\nThe Factions and Units. well there are 3 factions, all play different in many ways, the most difficult is the cartel. Also the units in the game, there are lots of alltime classics, like the Abrams tanks and LAVs, and of course the humvee, but for me kinda sucks that there is not a really russian oriented faction like in AoW, the cartel have the hind and T-50, but thats it, no T-80s or T-90s, migs or lot of that cool russian stuff, but is based on 2025 warfare, so, is ok\n\nThe Story. well i havent finished it yet, but is a generic the world is at war but not really story. it fits this game, yes, but could be better, more elaborated, but so far, the mission variety is good, so no really complains there.\n\nFinally, Does it worth buying? If you love rts like me, Yes\nIf you dont, problably not, is a difficult game, with a large learning curve, a rts player knows that, but if you are a total noob, you might not like it for 40 bucks.\nBut if you want this game to be your first RTS, go ahead, is a great game, is not the biggest community, but is constant. we are always there, playing and pwning.\n","September 2, 2015","true","31.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

Great graphics, 3 different factions that play differently but are fairly well balanced asymmetrically as far as I can tell. Plenty of upgrades and units for you to choose from and utilize to destroy your opponent. I can't speak to the multiplayer or Campaign because I've only been skirmishing vs the AI and let me tell you, you WILL get your butt whooped even by medium AI if you try to sit back and turtle until you get a death army. Suffice it to say, the AI is very competent and challenging, at least at the beginning, once you figure out decent build orders even the Very Hard becomes pretty easy to overcome.\n\nThe one negative thing I don't like is the resource production and management. You have 3 kinds of resources, oil which is used as cash, aluminum which you need to build buildings vehicles and upgrades, and rare earth which is harder to find on the map, but you need in order to get your most powerful upgrades and units. The problem is that you have to CAREFULLY manage what you spend which resource on and when, because if you're not aware of it, your economy will grind to a halt, until you start stockpiling more resources to pay for things, or cancel some of the stuff you're building to get your eco back on track. I guess that's ok, as it doesn't really allow you to mindlessly spam every kind of unit or upgrade, at least not until late late game where, depending on how well you've managed them, you're floating tons of pretty much every resource.\n\nAll in all if you like traditional RTS set in a modern/near future environment with some mechanics that differentiate it from the bunch (you can capture enemy vehicle pilots and generate resources with them for example), then make no mistake, this is the game for you. I've been playing it since they opened it for early access and I've had an absolute blast. I've actually started putting starcraft 2 on the back burner to play this instead, so yes it's a great RTS.","September 3, 2015","true","284.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

There is no unit cap at all, meaning you can create a truly spectacular army with all the glorious shells and explosions on a beautiful but not too taxing graphics engine. Eugen is advertising this game as a "return to the golden age of RTS" and they have achieved exactly that. If you are at all into strategy games, buy this one immediately.

Unit, Buldings and upgrades variety is a very big plus for me, as I was never a big fan of oversimplified games. The biggest problem in my eyes is the campaign, or more precisely, lack of any difficulty levels to chose from. The campaign has a very clear curve, with first missions being very easy, and the last mission being insanely hard. Still, even after hours of trying that last mission, I could not complete it as after you pass a certain point in it, the AI with limitless resources will just bomb you into oblivion with its 3 super weapons, an enourmous air force and omnipresent and clearly overpowered (as it can defeat any unit you throw it, even main battle tanks and attack helicopters) Artillery units "Koalitsia".

Alas, it fails quite miserably. I will review it in terms of single player and skirmish, I don't play strategy games multiplayer, it is invariably a bad experience no matter the game.\n\nSingle player is a write off. Voice acting is literally the worst I have ever experienced in a strategy game and not a "so bad it's good kind of way". It doesn't try to go for campy acting, it tries serious and fails even harder. The missions themselves are either boring or full of "gotcha, you going to have to repeat this part" moments where you are unlikely to succeed the first time. That is because the enemy will use overwhelming force in one point and you are unlikely to win unless you have exactly the right unit mixture in exactly the right place when the scripted event happens. There is also an evacuation mission where the enemy fire multiple superweapons at you and you don't even have a counter at that point in time, you instead have to evacuate, this is a strategy game equivalent of an "escort vip mission", lame beyond compare.\n\nSkirmish is just average, all the ingredients to make a good RTS are here, you got your "Rock, Paper, Scissors" unit interactions, you got some decent maps, you have to manage 3 resources and upgrade trees. But something is missing, the game has no soul. I will say this: the graphics are nice and it's relatively glitch free, but while I spent hundreds of hours in Generals, I can't see myself reaching even 20 in this.","September 15, 2015","false","23.7"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","9","21","0","0"

That ensured hours of fun gameplay, huge armies of units, and, sometimes, grueling back and forth).\n\nSlow unit response (and slow unit movement...). Many other people point this out. The units are sluggish. We're very much used to microing our units (SCII and COH). It's just extremely difficult to keep your crucial unit alive when it dies before it even acknowledges your command. This becomes largely frustating when you go back to the fact that there's limited resources, so a loss is a big loss, and it's all the more upsetting when the reason for their destruction is the slow response... Also, they take forever to go anywhere...\n\nGranted, I decided to write this review after only 8 hrs of gameplay, and after defeating for the first time the Easy AI. However, it felt so...unsatisfying. I felt so unfulfilled. I finally defeated the enemy, but I did not feel I accomplished anything. I focused on farming, deploying outposts and refineries and placing turrets for protection. After successfully defending against numerous waves, when I had enough resources I just bought infantry healing APCs, filled them with exoskeleton soldiers, and destroyed the enemy base. The whole time I was frustratingly trying to farm enough resources, and that just made the whole match not fun. With games like SCII and COH, you would deploy your units to skirmish against the enemy, but in AoA every engagement is completely anti-climatic. Since micro-managment is out the window, all you do is issue attack move on the enemy and hope you have more units than them. Unit type production doesn't even matter at higher tiers, cause you can just deploy vehicles/infantry that counter EVERYTHING. Say goodbye to your units, cause my units are efficient against infantry, vehicles, and aircrafts.\n\nMy opinion may change with more gametime...at least I hope so...","September 10, 2015","false","9.2"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","0"

Long waited and it does not seems to replace C&C... My arguments(after an hour of play - appologgies, but could not stand it more):\n1. Look and feel of the units are "unreal" - all needed features are there, but still the game does not feel right. Planes fly slow, and somehow cumbersome.\n2. Special effects are too expressive - example - missiles are bigger than the launcher and realism is sacrificed a lot;\n3. Spend quite some time to try and find how to mine "rare" element and was not able to locate it on the map - it is perhaps me being too stupid, but no abvious suitable location, although I was able to build refinery on "no deposits"...\n4. No pre-set formations or at least were not immediately visible -  guess the reliance will need to be on micromanagement.\n5. Units seem to be destroyed very easily - played against very easy and 4 light APC wrecked my selection of 7 units with only 3 remaining, including half-damaged MBT.\n6. Perhaps need some more time to play with, but I'm simply not captivated - no food for imagination and somehow the overall feel is not like game published 2015, but at least decade ago.

Looked good on magazines and trailers, but when I experienced it myself, it was good, the units, the factions, the gameplay, but there was something missing. It lacked something. Sure it had the base building the resource gathering, features that made me remind me of C&C. But I soon found out it lacked the fun factor. I was bored. It tried to pull me in with the campaign games, the chimera and the cartel(1 US mission with chimera, which is a real disappointment), but I could not have fun with them. The music is atrocious. None of the songs match the gameplay. You expect music that's epic, memorable, and catchy. This music was a epic fail. My brother even laughed at it, and he never touched a RTS game. He watch me play all the C&C games and he would look interested sometimes, but this game he just laughed at it and called it a Generals ripoff.\n\nThe factions are pretty neat, but in my opinon, I think you may last longer with chimera since they have buildings that produce resources while the other two have to rely on prisons, exhanging prisoners or capturing banks. The chimera's units cost cash, some aluminum, and rare earth, US rely on cash and aluminum, while cartel needs all 3 to run the base and units. The story is pretty decent and tries to do the same features as generals, but I just didnt care and skipped.\n\nOverall, its not bad, but does not fill the shoes like Supreme Commander, C&C Generals, and Starcraft 2. Not to mention its 45 bucks, lacks a faction campaign. People on chat got defensive about it but imagine playing C&C generals and you have just China and GLA and have 1 USA level in china. You be pretty upset that they did not add the faction.\n\n7/10\n\n+Factions are balanced and cool to play as\n+Stealth Tanks and Helicopters\n+Graphics\n+Blowing Up buildings and houses\n-Weak campaign\n-A bit pricey for something that does not bring anything new\n-Lacks a Faction campaign\n","September 13, 2015","false","14.6"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

If you do get into a lobby it wont be for long as you will be kicked out or lose connection. If you make it past that and start the game it wont last more than 10 mins Everyone in mulitplayer rushes withen 5 mins, now im fine with that in ranked but in normal multiplayer no just no. Also if you make it past that you will be superweaponed to death in 15 mins. Now in my personal opinion RTS multiplayer games you last on average 1 hour 30 mins if its a quick game. If you dont have 1 hour to play well go back to COD pls.\nRTS games are ment to take longer thats why i enjoy them I love long games when i play RON a different RTS with my friends it takes us about 2-3 hours to finish a game and i love that.\n\nFactions\nTheres not much to say, here are the 3 factions simplified\n\nCartel: Well your a stealth factions and are only useful for 5 mins after that everyone has counter stealth measures on all vehicles. So stealth was there only advantage and without it there are useless all of there units suck in all ways health damage and speed also everypatch they get nerfed so DONT USE THEM\n\nUS ARMY: Well your not terrriable but not great, there are the balanced faction. Units have tons of health and do lots of damage but cost alot. So they are useful for about 30 mins or intill all resources of the map have been depleted. After that your screwed.\n\nChimera: Well theres not much to say. Units are spamable do decent damage and have decent health. Artillery is ♥♥♥♥in OP as ♥♥♥♥. You can make 2 of the 3 resources so basically if you do it right you can last forever and still be spaming and effictive.

I keep trying to give it a try then get tired of the issues of just how the game was developed.   They seem to only have put that C&C line to just get players to buy it, its nothing like C&C wait it out till the price drops or major updates.","November 15, 2015","false","4.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","1"

Nice that its not random but being singular takes a little strategy out of it and seeing as the super weapons were ballanced around one of the now absent resources its impossible to say it hasent effected the game.\n\nThe general ballance feels off especially when combined with other elements of the game mechanics.\n\nFor instance, if you have a group of helicopters they can clump together and anti air missiles have splash damage so thats them done in pretty quickly which isnt the case for vehicles as they cant move ontop of each other.\n\nTheres more but the games just so vehicle focused it gets dull quickly.\n\nOne other thing they changed was the upgrades, removing some to be including automatically. Not that it matters because 90% of the upgrades are boring. 'Your solders now have rocket launchers yay...' they dont play into the near future settings and add no entertaining dynamics to the game.\n\nAircraft are now "powers" like they were in Act of War. Which would be fine if they werent done in the most work around way possible. It specifically states on the offical post about the aircraft update that ground attack craft work by using an "evac point" so you have to have that set behind the enemy you want to attack instead of designating an area to attack as you do with bombers or in games with a similar mechanic.\n\nBack onto the economy and its worth mentioning how quickly the resources die out turning the game into a boring turtle match as you cant afford to waste resources losing your fragile units.\n\nAll in all its just boring and if you thought the original game was boring the update wont change your mind.","October 15, 2015","false","8.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

First of all it is terribly optimized and doesnt look as good as you see on the screenshots. Voice acting and unit responses are bad and very limited , seems like it was done by 2 people one male and one female. Graphics are ok but even at the highest settings you still see horrible aliasing, UI is ugly and not intutive at all , it doesnt do a good job of explaning which button does what unless you read the text.\n\nThe biggest issue though is the unit controls. This is unaccaptble in a RTS game to say the least. Controls are very unresponsive and I couldnt even get the first mission's optional objective because soliders were not moving where they were told to. Its a shame because it looked like a great successor to C&C Generals after EA butchered the whole series.\n\n\n\nI cannot recommend this game at this price and with the issues I mentioned above. It might b e worth to revisit during Steam's winter sale to both get it cheaper and see whether devs patched it to resolve some of the issues I had.","September 4, 2015","false","0.8"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","12","28","0","2"

A game "hailing from the Golden Age of RTS" should actually incorporate some of the innovations in the genre since then.\n\nSo, I requested a refund: Learned that playing during Early Access - the Alpha and Beta - actually does count towards time played, and that Steam's timer counted me for closer to 5 hours actually played.

Been playing since day one of Beta and at first I was wow this game is awesome, however after having a few hours invested you will see the issues with game play balance and features that are just left unfinished. I had hoped when this game was released the developers would fix the numerus balance and other issues with the game. Some units are just way over powered for the cost, while others are useless, for longer games most but not all factions run out of resources. USA is the best to play for long duration games.\n\nPlease fix these problems;\nResources! Once you run out of resources on the map you are pretty much done. There is no sharing of resources, and each faction can only produce one or 2 types of resources, not all 3. This creates a very unfair playing field. If you can't produce all 3 resources atleast open up sharing of the resources. Cartel is the worse!\n\nUnit balance. Many units are very unbalance, any unit with a grenade launcher can take out most powered tank with 2 or 3 of these low cost units.\n\nBattle Experience; you move up in level but it seems to have no use. This is just one of many features that seems to be unfinished. At least give us a feature to view other players battle EXP so gage their experience level or create games that accept people based on level.\n\nFor a $45 game, I had high hopes for this game. I have a ton of time logged, and played since beta, but in general the game has not improved much since beta (“Its beta with extra maps released”).

For every good thing about AoA, one need not look very hard to find something that is more than inconvenient or suspiciously omitted. Additionally, with Legacy of the Void around the corner. there is no way that I could genuinely recommend AoA for $5 more than Blizzard’s conclusion to the SC2 trilogy. If AoA were closer to $15 than $40, I would recommend that hardcore RTS fans to check out Eugen Systems’ latest contribution to the genre. Unfortunately, AoA lacks the production value and pedigree of that would allow me to make the purchase suggestion without concession.

HOWEVER, they've consistently reduced the Cartels potency, they removed the Cartel's perma stealth which up against the other factions they NEED. The Cartel is more expensive and weaker than their other faction counterparts, and they relied on that quick minute or two that you don't have stealth detection to really dent anything. Abrams spam still plagues this game heavily, grab 10 abrams upgraded to TUSK 2 and you win, NO MATTER WHAT (i know from doing it myself.) I love that the devs have been listening to their players but hot damn they've been going about it all wrong, STOP trying to remove the STRATEGY from a REAL TIME STRATEGY game just because people were annoyed that they had to build some stealth detection to fight the Cartel late game. I won't be touching this game again until they fix the Balance issues in the game. It WAS the BEST RTS game i'd played in a really long time, this was better than C&C Generals in my opinion.

It could be good at some point.\n\nThe campaign is dull, quite surprisingly so being a spiritual successor (or spiritual remake almost) of Act of War which had quite a good campaign.\n\nOn the multiplayer/skirmish side of things has promise but is flawed.\nYou have three asymetrical factions, far from as asymetrical as the factions of StarCraft but still quite different, this is good.\nThe game has a silly amount of unit upgrades, and an overall complex tech tree, good or bad? Bit of both, could have been reigned in a little bit.\nInfantry is almost useless outside of holding banks (gives resources) or other buildings (defense) which is a shame. Vehicles and aircraft are handled well however.\n\nIn the end however, it all comes crashing down when you look at the map selection which is simply put pathetic. The game has seven 2 player maps, five 4 player maps, three 6 player maps and three 8 player maps. The game might just have launched but these numbers should be at least double of what they are.

I was a massive C&C Generals fan, I grew up on the C&C series in general and RTS games have always been my favourite genre, so I was really excited when Eugen told us that AoA is a 'return to the glory days of RTS' and a 'Generals Sequel'. Here's why this isn't any of that, and why you shouldn't buy this:\n\n- Resource collection and management is so micro-management intensive (see other reviews for more info) that it sucks the fun right out of the game. You have to spend so much time capturing, managing and defending resources that you can't spend any time on having fun building massive armies and fighting your opponents. In the end, all of your energy is focussed on resources and none on developing cool strategies and learning how the various units work.\n\n- There are too many resources, the nodes are too spread out, and the nodes don't regenerate. Additionally, there are no passive resource income options apart from one building per faction that can generate one of the three resources. Once a resource node is finished, that's it. If there are no more nodes of that resource within reach for you, you are basically stuffed. Unless you have the passive income generating building for your faction. If you need a resource that that building can't generate though, you're stuffed. Regardless of that though, why three resources to begin with? I can't understand the logic here. It is enough of a task having to collect and manage any one resource in any game for that matter. Forcing us to find, collect, manage and defend three different resources is asking for an insane amount of micro management that simply isn't fun. If I was going to have to micro manage anything, I'd rather be micro managing my tanks, thank you very much.\n\n- All units are too expensive, particularly heavy armour, and the game is riddled with balance issues. For example, almost any ground unit can attack aircraft, making helicopters a generally pointless expense. Additionally, almost any infantry unit can pretty effectively attack armour, and armour can't drive over infantry either. Mobile repair units are expensive and completely ineffective - even if you can keep the repair units alive, the repairers themselves work so slowly that they are unable to keep tanks under fire, alive. Generally, tanks cost too much for their lack of effectiveness.\n\n- Rush tactics and aggressive gameplay is basically enforced, to the exclusion of all other gameplay types. If you prefer a slower paced game, and particularly if you prefer turtling, you'll find that to be impossible in AoA and probably shouldn't buy this.\n\n- In general gameplay terms, the game is designed in such a way that you are forced to deploy complex teams of units. In other words, simply sending a column of tanks at a base is asking for almost instant defeat. I can see why this would appeal to fans of more realistic, serious games like Wargame, but it's off-putting for more casual type RTS gamers to be forced to have to send tanks, AA, artillery, Anti-Tank units, aircraft, repair units etc etc. I want to be able to win on my terms, not on terms dictated by the game.\n\n- The tech tree is pointlessly complex. I can see no reason why new tiers of technology must be researched - this only adds to the amount of micro required and only forces you to spend money that is already extremely difficult to come by (see above).\n\nIn conclusion, this is simply not a fun game and I don't recommend it at this point. The level of micro management required in terms of resource management and the cost versus vulnerability of end game armour units plus the inflexible gameplay style enforced by the design of the game, mean that this is more likely to appeal to serious RTS wargamers and less likely to appeal to those looking for a more relaxed, less intensive experience similar to what we had in Generals and the C&C series.\n","September 26, 2015","false","15.5"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","2","8","0","0"

While this might seem true at the first glance, it really isn't. Here are a few reasons why:\n\n- Indistinguishable units and buildings: it's just plain hard to see your units on the ground, they often just blend in with the surroundings, which is realistic, but a pain in the back in an RTS game. It's very hard to see if you're selecting a sniper, grenadier or something else. Same goes with occupied buildings, while C&C occupied buildings have visible blue/green/red markings on them, this game just adds a subtle color filter.\n\n- Voice acting. Unit voices are so-so and become boring very fast. Forget all the fun lines from generals ("It's very hot in here!", shivers down my spine while writing this). The objective announcer is just plain cringeworthy and makes the game feel very cheap.\n\n- Boring campaign. I'm mostly a solo player so this is very important to me. Unfortunatly this is also a major problem of the game. Missions seem so utterly boring: kill everyone at point A. After that the forementioned terrible announcer tells you that a VIP is under fire. No need to rush, so it seems, they'll just wait until your army arrives and you crush them.","September 14, 2015","false","1.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Oh, and the AI is incredibly stupid and unpredictable; sometimes Very Hard is easier than Very Easy.\n\nFinally, currently this game is losing people faster than sinking boat. Many players also feel that the game is already dead, even though it's only been a month since its release. If you really want this game, I've warned you that few people still playing MP.","September 6, 2015","false","174.1"," 15 of 35 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","15","35","3","2"

Speaking as an older player that perfers single player these days, I feel disappointed.\n\nEugen Systems always put more effort in to multiplayer in their games than they do in Skirmish or Single player. It has been a consistant problem in all their games so far.\n\nEven though single player fans dont always want every map to be mirrored or fair and do want to be given control of their armies early in a campaign, and do want some sort of credible back story. Eugen Systems always fail to deliver those things and insists on leading the player around by the nose in its single player campaigns.\n\nI do not believe Eugen Systems understand what sort of player actually plays RTSGs in single player.  The whole Player dreams up his own strategy aspect of RTSGs seems to elude them as they tell players what to do instead of letting them get on with it them selves.\n\nMultiplayer has traditionally been a way of evading responsibility for making good AIs and good single player features that do require more work from the Devs. Multiplayer does not need any of that, it is the easiest RTSG to make, so it is bad sign when a dev skimps on single player. It means they skimped on other areas of the game too.  Areas even multiplayer fans would want and those areas are the areas that makes games like these in to classics rather than releases that get forgotten within 2 years when the multiplayer attraction fades.\n\nWhat Eugen Systems have done with this game is make everything utterly and completely fair for multiplayer fans and in doing so destroyed any real attempt at strategy for everybody else.\n\nEvery map is mirrored... they are ALL utterly fair..... But I ask you, was D Day fair.... was Stalingrad fair.... was the Blitz fair, was the Battle of Britain fair, how about the Alamo... was that fair ?\n\nYet Eugen Systems war sim is very fair.... and dull... and boring.....\n\nI had to force my self to play it because nothing about this games single player features was remotely interesting.\n\nFunny thing is, they announced a sequel to this game before this game was even released, which is a sign they are about to repeat the same design mistake that they make in all their games.\n\nSo my advice to you is this, if you see Eugen Systems is the developer and you are not a multiplayer fan... save your money... buy another game.  If you are a multiplayer fan and you see Eugen Systems is the developer and the game is more than 2 years old, save your money and buy another game.\n\nEugen Systems games tend to die a death online after about 2 years.... so its only selling point disappears after 2 years normally.\n\nNot recommended unless you are a multiplayer fan and the game is still less than 2 years old.\n\n5 out 10.....\n\nFor single player fans RUSE is still their best game even though it has these problems. Thankfully you can spend your UBI points earned by playing the game to get the D Day map which is not fair and is there for fun to play in single player. RUSE is actually a very good game, far better than this and cheaper too since it is about 5 years old.\n\nPS This game was released on 2nd September 2015.... so all those 2nd September reviews are first day of release reviews and they gave this game a very big Thumbs up on day 1. Which is now slowly disappearing as people actually play this game for real and give it a more realistic score.","September 6, 2015","false","6.9"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","10","25","0","0"

Some of you may be OK with at least some of these, but for me they really ruined my gaming experience.\n\nDesign decisions that ruined the game for me:\nThere are three types of resources.\nYou cannot repair your buildings.\nYou cannot repair or heal your units.\nThere are no unit promotions.\nYou can lose an army in one hit.\nThe damage done in this game to units is too high. If one unit can destroy another unit or in fact several in just one hit, you know there is something wrong with the balance. The three resource types are a problem because of the way everything else works. For example, you build buildings that use up a limited resource type. Because you can't repair your buildings, you eventually lose them. Just as well, you build advanced units that you can't heal or repair, three artillery units fire at you and you lose most of what you had in one hit.\n\nInfantry becaomes mostly useless in fights because it dies to everything, even to the radioactive dust left after explosions.\n\nWhile there are buildings that repair the buildings around them or units that repair or heal the units around them, they are all faction-specific and you can only have one. Unit promotions would of helped keep your army alive.\n\nThe campaignI was one of the first people that live streamed the singleplayer campaign at launch on Twitch TV. All of the people in the chat were making fun of how bad the singleplayer campaign was set up.\n\nReasons why the campaign is bad:\nNo real cinematics or mission briefings.\nThe story makes no sense and is never explained.\nThe game mechanics listed above make it impossible to enjoy the campaign.\nRegarding the cinematics and mission briefings, you either get some floating name tags with bad voice-over or floating pictures with voice-overs. The developers were very lazy, it's a joke.\n\nThe very first mission starts with something like "this lady is here, go get her." Who you are and who "they" are is never explained, you just get thrown into it. I'm at the end of the campaign and I still don't know why we are fighting, who they are, or even who I am.\n\nWhen playing a singleplayer campaign, I like to take my time, endulge in my OCD and build up a nice base. Prepare my defenses and build up an army before moving out. Here, the game forces you to play the game at the level of StarCraft2. I don't want to have to play my singleplayer campaign like a competitive match, I want to enjoy the game.\n\nTo build a propper base, you would need to build two Outposts next to each other in every corner of your base. These outposts can repair nearby buildings, but you need two because it does not repair itself. This could be fixed with a Repair button that most other Strategy games have. To keep your army alive, or at least help, you would need multiple mobile repair/healing units with it. This could be fixed if units did not do so much damage against other units and if they had a promotions system that helped repair/heal them outside of the base.\n\nThese are all just personal preferences and I know that some people can handle the game as is, but I can't. Act of War was a lot more fun to play.","September 27, 2015","false","14.1"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","5","15","0","0"

I hope you read it start to finish. Important points are in bold. If you only read the bold sentences, you will get a good jist of the review, but I highly recommend that you read the review start to finish if you have any past experience with RTS.\n\nA bit of background: I am an avid Starcraft II (another, much more popular RTS) player. I mostly enjoy games for their gameplay. And I must say, Starcraft II has spoiled any other non-Blizzard-made RTS title for me, because they nailed it so hard with Warcraft III, Starcraft, and Starcraft II, in my opinion. You may or may not agree, so please do not base your decision of if this review is helpful or not on that.\n\nHaving played Command and Conquer Generals and the Zero Hour expansion, I must say that if you enjoyed those games, you will enjoy this one. The games are extremely similar in gameplay and interface, with a few tweaks and of course improvements in this game. In my experience, this game, although only in beta, has a bit less depth than CnCG. I assume the game will increase depth as it progresses, but in its current state, I would prefer the depth of CnCG with the interface and game engine of this game. I would reccomend strongly considering buying this game if you were a fan of the Command and Conquer Generals series.\n\nA very important article from wikipedia to read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy#Gameplay\n\nHowever, coming from a spoiled community of RTS gamers who mainly play Blizzard RTS titles, I must say this game is very poor in terms of overall gameplay. Let me dissect what you're looking at in each aspect of the game (in my experience):\nMacro: Doesn't matter how many resources you have, you can infinitely queue units to be built (And they build when you get the resources). This means the macromanagement is essentially automated to the point of being non-existant.\nMicro: The units move so slow that micro isn't even a part of the game.\nPositioning (Tactics): Maybe the only redeeming factor of the game. Where your units are positioned to control various points is important in securing a win.\nDecision-Making (Strategy): With so little time played, I don't think I can comment on this fully. However, the strategy seems as one-dimensional as CnCG in that infantry becomes utterly useless (and moves so slow) once vehicles of any kind are out. You tech to higher tech and there is no decision-making in this process. Each step in the tech tree is so much stronger that it becomes stupid to use anything of the previous tech level.\nSeeing as this game is dismal at best in 3 out of 4 of these core parts of an RTS, I have to say that I don't reccomend it for someone looking for fun, interesting, and deep gameplay. Because this is what I was looking for, that is why I overall don't reccomend the game. However, if you feel the first bold reccomendation is more relevant to you, this game might be worth your money.\n\nBecause I bought this game expecting interesting gameplay, I feel that I wasted the $45 I spent on it in that aspect. I only feel justified in it because my friend enjoys the game and I want to be a good friend and play a game that he enjoys, not necessarily with gameplay that is interesting to me.\n\nIf you're new to the RTS genre, this game provides an easy transition to the genre through its generally slow-paced gameplay. (And large explosions with a good factor of realism)\n\nAs for the interface, I don't like the lack of customization they give you for all hotkeys. I would like to see a larger set of customizable hotkeys as well as settings. Also, they should get rid of any sort of camera acceleration while moving the mouse to the edge of the screen. This is an RTS, I need to know what I'm doing when. I know anyone would go insane trying to play any game with a mouse with mouse acceleration. Please get rid of anything like that in your game.  These points are things that can easily be fixed and will probably not apply in the future of the game as they change the interface.\n\nLast note: As a Starcraft II gamer, I feel out of control of the units themselves because they are so slow and sluggish to control, which leads me to become frustrated at the game at times because I don't feel in control of my own actions. I'm sure the game will change as they move forward, however, nothing big will happen to the gameplay in all likelyhood, so this review should stay relevant to the game even as it grows up.","September 7, 2015","false","27.9"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

Or Aggrivation? The map zooms out to satilite mode far too early, I cant even have my entire base within frame at the sametime before it swtiches. Unit upgrades to not apply to already produced units. Maps are uncreative and create more of a "Battle Arena" feel than engaging an opponent on an actual "Battlefield". The maps are not dynamic or natural, the feel is very superficial and scripted. Even the base locations are usually directly across from one another. As for the models, they are admirable in there detail, but the fire sequence for the units which produce a thick unrealistic cartooney tracer round that just looks like a flying blip of pixels towards the target is just, why would you even put that in? Include a good muzzle flare and recoil amonst the unit but if you cant get a tracer to look like anything but a flying "dash" shooting across the screen just leave it out, is slows framerates and looks AWFUL, adds to the cartoonish annoyance that this game provides in abundnace. One of the largest issues is that althou E seemed intent on creating many options and upgrades for every faction, unit, and part of unit, there isent necessarily variation in the upgrades themselves. For example as mentioned earlier, having to upgrade each individual unit does not add to the games fun  or appeal. You cant add purposless options for people to click and expect that to be satisfactory as an example of game depth. Its just annoying and adds a redundent level of micromanagment that is not fun or efficiant. The story, although I admit I did not play all the way through is lame, and patchworked, the cinematics are just voice overs with pictures of people flashing at the screen and nonsense nontstop new casts. Look if you want a great example of a modern combat RTS shooter with download COH, and then instal the Modern Combat MOD. Honestly, COH-Modern Combat MOD should have been there template, it has base building, modern units, excellent effects and physics, detail, everything is fantastic, its just unfinished and obviously unofficial as it is a MOD. However, it kicks the **** out of this garbage that E systems churned out. Look I know what there were trying to do, and I was honestly really excited, but bringing back the golden age of RTS from about 10-15 years ago DOES NOT MEAN disregarding all we have learned and applied to RTS games since then, it means taking the foundation of those RTS games and incorporating the lessons weve learned since that time without loosing that golden RTS foundation. But they did not do that, instead they just made a game that for all intents and purposes, looks, plays, and IS an RTS from 10-15 years ago...with no improvements. Again, perfect example of golden age RTS with modern units AND incorperates great improvements from over the years? COH-Modern Combat MOD. Sorry AoA, I had my hopes REALLY high, and REALLY wanted to like this game, but its cartoony and lame.

I've played RUSE (which I really like), Wargame: AirLand Battle (which I didn't really spend a lot of time with as it sort of bounced off me), and dabbled in Act of War. I didn't much like Act of War. It was very similar to Command & Conquer: Generals (set in the near future), except it came off as a cheap knock-off. As a result, I wasn't particularly interested in Act of Aggression, which was billed as the spiritual successor to Act of War (the name couldn't be used due to intellectual property shennanigans).\n\nNevertheless, I looked at videos and read some early reports from players that seemed to indicate that the game was fun. At least, a new base building RTS! (If you ignore Grey Goo, which is superior in every way and an excellent RTS.) However, playing the game one thing became obvious to me: it isn't any fun. A game in the mould of Command & Conquer should be flashy and exciting and fun, bit this game is just dull. So very, very dull. Your samey units move through an uninteresting world, defending spots where you harvest one of three key resources, each colour-coded for your convenience (gold, blue, and red).\n\nThere are probably nuances at work that I didn't get in the less than 2 hours that I played before requesting a refund. But if a game isn't instantly enjoyable, what good is it? Why spend hours and hours engaged in something that you don't like? Reading reviews that are slowly coming in and listening to podcasts (such as a recent Three Moves Ahead podcast), it seems like I'm not the only one. Act of Aggression is serviceable, but unremarkable, and it comes off as dull. Why play this when there are so many other, better options around?","September 16, 2015","false","1.7"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

It is also enough to find numerours game-braking bugs such as lack of saving for graphics conifugration(anyone else getting it? Where everythime a message comes up saying configurations didn't save).\n\nThe gmae does offer traditional RTS base-building resource extraction and map control, however the mechanics in the game and functions of the UI, units etc....limit it's potential.\n\n1. The Road system where vehicles take that direct route without consent(add a button pehaps)can mess up strategies and potential operatinos if you know what I mean(not sexual, like seriously guys).\n\n2. Unit Pathfinding which goes loop in loop with the Road system.\n\n3. The UI offers a luck-luster amount of info. No storage caps, no income amounts, structures are a hassle to identify because of smaller print and longer names.\n\n4. Units seem to target only one unit and overkill with, while if they had focused on seperate ones they would have won the battle.\n\n5. Delays in orders, as in when you click a move order a few, 1-2 seconds later they then move.\n\n_________\n\nThe campaign is not great, and that might turn many people down as not everyone drools over multiplayer. This will most likely not be fixed and that makes it dissapointing(This hampers this game from being considered spiritual sucessor of CnC.

However, I couldn't get into the game. Was very slow paced, played for 4-5 hours before completely losing interest. Then came the beta reboot, so far the only thing I've been able to get out of it is hours of browsing forums trying to find out why it keeps auto-picking the wrong graphics settings for my computer. I'll load it, I'll be able to see things properly, then the auto-settings will take over and the screen goes black while I listen to the theme music.\n\nI was really hoping to like this game, at least the reboot, especially since it's been getting better reviews. However, I really don't have the time to sit and tinker with the settings to try to get it to work. I just wanted to spend a bit of time  testing the reboot out, but now I've spent the last 2 hours trying to make it even playable.\n\nI think I'm giving up entirely on this game at this point.","May 4","false","3.9"," 9 of 29 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","9","29","0","4"

Don't expect much from this game. It is like playing a very old RTS (like 5-6 years old). It even crashed after 76 minutes of gameplay.\n\nMy overall grade would be like 5/10. Very average, if not below average.Especially considered the high price. I got hyped up quickly and bought the game full price, which I would know admit to be a mistake. I would rather buy it on sale and have alittle fun with it a few hours.

There's some naggling issues and some features that are badly needed but overall the game is still worth playing and is certainly the only decent entry in the base building RTS genre in the last few years.\n\nSingle player isn't the very best, it's a bit short and consists of 15 missions in it's entirity with the first five basically being tutorial missions given how straight forward and incredibly short they are. The game just throws you into the story with not much of a care for it's background. Essentially you start off the campaign not giving a damn about it's story or plot. In games like Command and Conquer there was more of an effort to draw you in and fill you in on enough of both factions to warrant interest from the start... here, not so much. Worth playing but I don't think anyone will be hailing AoA's campaign as the definitive reason to play this RTS. Of course, having said that, i'm only about halfway through the single player so for all I know things may actually get a lot more interesting, have a lot more going on and brings the story full ark but given i'm already halfway through there's certainly an element of disappointment having not experienced any real enjoyment from it yet.\n\nThe multiplayer is fun. It's back to the old school base building, army mashing RTS of yesteryear a la C&C just don't expect too much seriousness from it as typically these kind of RTS games have never been seen by the wider community as competitve or serious contenders, they're more for fun. MP is fun but I feel they really dropped the ball in regards to your options in joining a match. There is no match making for normal games. Everything is done through a browser for standard games. The only way match making comes into the equation is if you play ranked 1v1 or 2v2 and you have to play with a friend in 2v2. There is no random match making. This sucks for a lot of people. When I play a game that's even slightly competitive in nature I don't want to look for lobbies to join. I want to click a button and play wtih and against random players who I have never seen before. A lot of people are like this. It's just the set standard to have some form of Quick Match or Match Making for all parts of the multiplayer scene be it competitive or otherwise. Here, you only have match making for ranked which is a huge oversight. Even at that there is no random match making such as having random teams formed by the match making service so there's virtually no solo play outside of the server browser or 1v1 ranked.\n\nIt is a solid game. There needs to be a function for random normal games to be played at the click of a button and not completely reliant on a server browser. Server browsers have a place in certain types of games and certain genres but in games like this the server browser should be secondary when it comes to matching players up... otherwise it just feels cheap, dated and unnecessarily tedious just to join and play a single match.\n\nDespite these gripes, if you really want a base building RTS, this is the game you should buy. It's probably the best base building RTS in the genre to come out in the last five years and it has quite a healthy player base. The single player is there and should only take a couple of hours to beat but if you're in it for the multiplayer it's got the content there and a lot of promise to build upon with much needed features such as a proper match making system.","September 6, 2015","false","24.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So I'll give it a fair review, and considering the price, this game isn't worth it.\n\nThe game's soundtrack is absolutely terrible, forgettable, and the ambience and sound design is nearly non-existent. I could swear, when I was listening to the game's music, I thought I could hear crickets in the background.\n\nSingleplayer draws your interest in with the idea of a US invasion of Mexico, which could happen. That idea is great, but when the game starts, you're supposed to catch and arrest someone? For something? Then the story becomes an overglorified tutorial for multiplayer--Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad idea, but the way it's presented is bad in general. You go from continent to continent at random, with no sense of progression. Can't we have an SP like CnC Tiberium wars, where they actually gave you a map before clicking on a mission? When we were attacked by Cartel at Chimera's Headquarters, I had absolutely no idea we were at their main Headquarters, at the end of the mission you just got "Chimera doesn't exist anymore!" for some reason. Starcraft and Starcraft Brood War singleplayers felt progressive. When you booted up the game and played the first mission, you were greeted with a character/hero unit with their own problems and goals. You knew where the story was taking place in a certain location, why, and how they got there. Act of Aggression's story is more like, "Oh we're here because the bad guys are here, and we apparently know that somehow." CnC Tiberium wars, has the decency of at least showing us a map, and having a character explaining what is going on in that mission and why it's important. Sure, CnC was always cheesy, but at least it had direction. Act of Aggression's Campaign takes itself seriously, then shoots itself in the foot.\n\nSo, then the game draws you into it's multiplayer. Which is great, the unit concepts are sound, the base-building isn't too bad, and there is plenty of variety. But there are tons of game mechanics that make a player feel like it's a cluttered mess. It isn't the upgrades or the hard counters, although people believe this. After playing for 100 hours, I think I know why players are having so many problems with AoA.\n\nAct of Aggression presents you wonderfully designed maps, but the biggest downfall is that these maps are absolutely huge. Think starcraft2, except think of playing on a normal skirmish map being 10x it's normal size. The maps basically require huge zoomouts because of these gigantic maps. The resources are too widespread, and the units too small. Then the resource mechanic. Players, especially the new ones, will complain that there are too many types of resources. Yet, I don't think that's what makes resources a problem. The problem lies in resources being too widespread, refineries being incredibly expensive, and the fact that new players will always feel completely lost when starting a game. Resources will always either be at 0 or stockpile way too high, and the way Resources are spent don't help the multi-resource mechanic either. In games like CnC, you had 1 resource, and it was spent overtime when you built units/structures. But in AoA you have multiple resources all of which are being drained simultaneously, overtime, and there is no figuring out how to manage your resources effectively. In CnC Tiberium Wars, at least there was 1 resource to keep track of, and you had the freedom to mine Tiberium long distance. The game itself doesn't tell you how much resources you're gathering at a certain rate, so economically you don't know if you were doing any good. Then there's a lack of a game timer, so new players will always feel lost, they can't judge when attacks will come or what an enemy can/will have at certain times. They can't predict enemy movements, or make guesses, we're all in the dark. It gets worse.\n\nIn a base-building game, you want consistent, reliable, and responsive units. Base-building games require this, because every unit is extremely crucial. Act of Aggression forces you to predict a scenario before clicking, there's some sort of command delay that forces you to play like you're ping is always at 1000ms. Most of the time units are just lost due to the fact that controlling armies is tough and incredibly hard. This doesn't help in the cases of units like Helicopters, and especially recon units. You can't micro for your life to save those units unless you predict what will be in said area and click before that specific scenario happens to you. Units aren't responsive or smooth, they feel slippery and inconsistent, and most importantly it feels like units get themselves killed most of the time.\n\nThen there is base-building itself, which is terribly done. It restricts you so much, and a game mechanic makes repairing buildings unreliable. I can't just repair a burning building or repair turrets as reliably in other games. The build radius for building around your HQ is pitifully small. In 1v1 games, I could barely extend the build radius with LEMs, you just require FOBs/Outposts, etc.\n\nAct of Aggression is a good game, but where it falls flat isn't the unit balance, upgrades, and not even it's multiple-resources. It falls flat as a 'great RTS' because it's singleplayer is nonsensical and dull. The units aren't responsive, hard to control, the base-building is too restricting, and the game lacks a proper zoom. It's maps are too huge, with it's resources spread out too thin across an already huge map, and even though it has a great multiplayer... It's lack of a game timer, it's resource mechanics, repair/building mechanics all make you feel lost and overwhelmed by it's choices. The game itself is already hard to control, but when an RTS lacks the basics of a base-building RTS game, players are going to get completely lost. For it's price, it's lack of singleplayer, it's hard controls, makes it not worth it's price.","September 2, 2015","false","129.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It ticks a lot of the boxes to be a really solid RTS. It's a lot like Command and Conquer: Generals as many have said, although I strongly disagree that it's the spiritual successor.\n\nI absolutely love the C&C series. Generals was fantastic, and I always wished for a new one. After trying for many hours to get into this game and enjoy it, and telling myself "It's like a new Generals!" I just can't play it anymore. I don't find it fun at all. It's one of those games that looks decent graphically, and sounds like what you want, but then you play it and simply find yourself not having any fun. It's extremely bland, has no personality, and just feels like a really generic RTS.\n\nIt does some things a little differently from Command and Conquer, and for me personally, each of these differences is for the worse. I find the UI to be clunky, cumbersome and ugly. The units and buildings seem to be somewhat realistic in size, which sounds great, but in practice it means infantry are more or less little specks on the map, and vehicles are so small you can hardly enjoy their visuals and see what makes them visually unique, unlike most other RTS games and especially Generals. I have to scroll way in, and when I do, everything looks surprisingly awesome as far as detail, much more than I'm used to in an RTS. But it doesn't matter, because no one plays zoomed in near ground level, so you'll never see any of it.\n\nIn the end, this isn't by any means a bad game. You might really enjoy it, as many do. I can see why people do. But personally, for me, this is just a bland, generic, incredibly un-fun version of Generals.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAfter having played the Reboot of the game, I've changed my review to recommend the game. I wrote this game off after I played it, and haven't touched it since release. I heard they were launching a Reboot of the game by tweaking and changing numerous aspects of the gameplay based on user feedback. They've simplified the gameplay by making there be a single currency, base construction is now done via construction units (like many RTS games), while upgrades are found on their respective buildings. These changes alone may not sound like much, but they significantly impact the feel of the game, and the intuitiveness of the UI.\n\nAlthough there's still room for improvement, and I wouldn't yet classify this as on the same level of classics like C&C, the numerous changes they've made add up to- for me- a vastly more enjoyable game, and one I'd recommend checking out. In an age of early access scams, lazy development, and games that are abandoned after the money is made, the developers continuing commitment to this game is impressive. After taking heavy criticism (from people like me), rather than pack up and jump ship after they made their money, they listened to the criticism and continued to work on the game and improve it based on what people wanted.\n\nThis kind of approach to game development is sorely missed today, and I have a huge amount of respect to the devs for it. I, and plenty others, played it, didn't like it, and shelved it. The devs listened, and cared enough to put effort into making the game fun for those who bought it and invited them to come back and give it a try. Well, it paid off. I came back and gave it a try, had a lot of fun, and have changed my review to a positive recommendation. Even if it may or may not be among the best of all time (yet), if you're looking for a fun new, modern day RTS, the new Act of Aggression is a safe bet, and worth checking out.","September 8, 2015","true","44.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","15"

There is an element of it which one evaluates with bias, and another element which makes up all generic reviews. The game fails to bring anything substantially new to RTS genre; however it does succeed in achieving a playable game reminiscent of C&C. The campaign is below average. It is not immersive and brings the games single player experience plummeting down. Skirmish is fun. The AI is smart and offers a great challenge.\n\nEven though multiplayer would appear to be upon first glance a winning factor, which would make up for all of its previous faults mentioned, it brilliantly fails to provide anything of substance. This is due to a scarcity of servers and players. I live in Australia and there are basically no servers to play on as of now. You will be lucky to find one, and even then they will probably kick you. So, you’re buying it for Skirmish. Nothing wrong with that, it’s actually a fun game over all. All this means is you shouldn't spend over $26. I can’t recommend this game for anything else other than solo skirmish.\n\nREBOOT release (An overhaul of the game by developers)\n\nThe newest version of ACT OF AGGRESSION is a huge improvement. The most important and visible component of the game overhauled was its economy. Instead of THREE resources being used for unit/building development, it has been all merged under the resource “money”. This changes things significantly. There are fewer resource deposits, oil being the only resource. It means players will have to secure parts of the map with oil to secure a steady flow of income. There are no more construction limits, you can build where ever. No more needless time wasted spending money to construct stock houses. It also has indirectly made cheaper units like infantry and light vehicles a viable alternative because of the rate money flows. Too further explain my point:\n\nIn the previous version, cheap infantry would cost money and require oil extraction. Heavy vehicles would require maybe aluminium or rare materials. Sometimes the cost would have several resources or just the one. This essentially meant a player would be purchasing some units with a different financial balance. Of course, if the player had deficiencies in resources they would not use units requiring that deficient resource. Hence, acquiring better resources for better units inevitably made many of the other lower tier units redundant.\nThe new system means there is only one balance, and that’s the only balance you will use at any one given time. In accordance with building purchases and upgrades, players will have less of a consumerist mentality when purchasing units.\n\nThe changes are quite substantial on gameplay. However, ACT OF AGGRESSION is very much the same game from release, even with the overhaul. They are not changing the game entirely, and to be honest you don’t expect them to. Eugen really is a gaming company for the people. It’s commendable of Eugen going back to the drawing board and improving their game. They didn’t have to but they did. The changes they made were certainly C&C inspired.\n\nI would still recommend this game for $26 or less.","December 26, 2015","true","28.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

It's extremely bland, has no personality, and just feels like a really generic RTS.\n\nIt does some things a little differently from Command and Conquer, and for me personally, each of these differences is for the worse. I find the UI to be clunky, cumbersome and ugly. The units and buildings seem to be somewhat realistic in size, which sounds great, but in practice it means infantry are more or less little specks on the map, and vehicles are so small you can hardly enjoy their visuals and see what makes them visually unique, unlike most other RTS games and especially Generals. I have to scroll way in, and when I do, everything looks surprisingly awesome as far as detail, much more than I'm used to in an RTS. But it doesn't matter, because no one plays zoomed in near ground level, so you'll never see any of it.\n\nIn the end, this isn't by any means a bad game. You might really enjoy it, as many do. I can see why people do. But personally, for me, this is just a bland, generic, incredibly un-fun version of Generals.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAfter having played the Reboot of the game, I've changed my review to recommend the game. I wrote this game off after I played it, and haven't touched it since release. I heard they were launching a Reboot of the game by tweaking and changing numerous aspects of the gameplay based on user feedback. They've simplified the gameplay by making there be a single currency, base construction is now done via construction units (like many RTS games), while upgrades are found on their respective buildings. These changes alone may not sound like much, but they significantly impact the feel of the game, and the intuitiveness of the UI.\n\nAlthough there's still room for improvement, and I wouldn't yet classify this as on the same level of classics like C&C, the numerous changes they've made add up to- for me- a vastly more enjoyable game, and one I'd recommend checking out. In an age of early access scams, lazy development, and games that are abandoned after the money is made, the developers continuing commitment to this game is impressive. After taking heavy criticism (from people like me), rather than pack up and jump ship after they made their money, they listened to the criticism and continued to work on the game and improve it based on what people wanted.\n\nThis kind of approach to game development is sorely missed today, and I have a huge amount of respect to the devs for it. I, and plenty others, played it, didn't like it, and shelved it. The devs listened, and cared enough to put effort into making the game fun for those who bought it and invited them to come back and give it a try. Well, it paid off. I came back and gave it a try, had a lot of fun, and have changed my review to a positive recommendation. Even if it may or may not be among the best of all time (yet), if you're looking for a fun new, modern day RTS, the new Act of Aggression is a safe bet, and worth checking out.","September 8, 2015","true","44.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","15"

After a while of only balance updates, they're abandoning support for the game-as-launched in favor of a Reboot Edition which makes some pretty drastic changes like removing the three-resource system and making builders full units.  To me, some of the changes are good and some are not so good, but all of them remove some of what was unique about the game.\n\nI'm also not pleased about the splintering of the game into two.  The campaign is not being supported in Reboot Edition.  You'll still be able to play the original game, but any future multiplayer maps are not being added to the original, only Reboot Edition.  With this kind of post-launch support, I can no longer recommend the game.\n\n--------------\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nSay what you will about the clunkier aspects of this game; I can safely say that after the boring first 3 missions of the Chimera campaign, the rest of the campaign brought back the feeling of singleplayer RTS goodness that even Starcraft II hasn't quite managed to reach.\n\nYes, the cinematics are low-budget and the story is just a rehash of Act of War with financial terrorism replacing oil shortages, but remember that the original C&C Generals didn't even have cutscenes or a connected story and it was still fairly fun.\n\nSkirmish AI is quite fun, challenging enough to give you a good game.\n\nOnly downside is that there's only 15 missions across the campaigns and the first three Chimera missions are kind of a waste.  The later missions are much higher-quality and can take quite a long time, which partially makes up for it, but I do wish there was more content here.\n\nAll in all, this game is well worth your time, though not quite worth the $45 price.  If you want an RTS that despite some clunkiness recaptures that RTS singleplayer magic, then get this game when it's on sale for $30.","September 27, 2015","false","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
