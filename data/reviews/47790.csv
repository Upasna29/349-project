The setting looks like the mountains I flew over and the valley I rucked in. It looks like Afghanistan, it sounds like Afghanistan, and despite the game-isms, does a good job of telling the story.  Little things stand out to me - the visible selector switch from semi to full, the relatively realistic weapons models, the radio chatter and dialogue - as authentic. There are some reality breakers, like a general in a suit during cutscenes or the wrong time period highspeed gofast gear on dudes in a game set in 2001, but I can put them aside and enjoy the atmosphere.\n\nThe campaign isn't going to appeal to everyone. It's shorter than some, and it's not full of Michael Bay explosions like the Call of Duty series (which I also own). What makes the single player shine is that it's based on real events. The set pieces (vehicle sections, stand-and-fights) are well presented, and logically flow with the game. There's a sense of being part of a larger picture with the radio chatter between AFOs Neptune and Wolfpack and their boss ('Jimmy,' or COL Drucker in the cutscenes). Your actions make sense, and several times throughout the game you'll see the other AFO doing their part of the missions.\n\nIt's worth picking up, on sale or full price, and getting a solid play through. If you want to see a more realistic shooter than the Call of Duty series with a story grounded in actual events, this is the one. This is probably the most under-appreciated military shooter in recent memory for me, purely as an on-the-rails gut wrench adrenaline ride (the downhill scramble to the chopper and the stand-your-ground sequences in particular). Yeah, there's hand-holding, but it the game it makes sense. No one plays rambo in real life, because that's how you die.","November 29, 2015","true","15.7"," 62 of 66 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","62","66","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/47790/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","This Medal of Honor game, is the thirteenth in the series as a whole. It was released in October 2010 on PC and both consoles. This it the first of the Medal of Honor games to not take place during World War II, this time we are in Afghanistan.\n\nGame play is almost identical to other FPS games of this type. It has a very hand holding feel to it, you are part of a squad of elite soldiers, and you could actually just sit back and let them do the killing if you were that was inclined. You have to follow a linear path on each level and it offers only one way of getting there. You take part in ground missions, sniper missions and Apache gunner missions throughout the single player campaign. All of the guns feel  very much the same, and for some reason, and they make a shotgun the weakest weapon ever... A couple of the missions are based on stealth style gameplay, which is something I am really starting to get into, and it does that side of things very well. It offers something new to see in a generic FPS game. The regular run and gun gameplay is very repetitive in this Medal of Honor title.\n\nThis game was made using a very heavily modified Unreal Engine 3.I was playing Medal of Honor on 4k resolution, and it looks amazing. The character models are probably my favorite thing about this game when on the topic of graphics. I got a good few screenshots of just how lifelike their faces looked, it took me by quite a surprise if I am honest.  Some of the textures are a bit low quality, but they only seem to be in places where you aren't really expected to look, but it was a shame to see it since it did kind of ruin the immersion for me when the rest of the game looked so good.\n\nThe plot takes place in 2001, during the opening days of the invasion of Afghanistan. Whilst it has a very generic, america beats everyone feel to it, I did quite enjoy the story; it has some good character development and interesting plot points. It is certainly a better story than most of the CODs.\n\nMedal of Honor offers no difficulty at all, you are hand held throughout the whole game by the rest of the squad and I don't think I died even once whilst playing. Some of the more challenging missions would be when you are playing the sniper missions, because you have to find enemies in a open landscape, and they are camouflaged to the high heavens and makes it practically impossible to spot them.\n\nAll of the levels in Medal of Honor are very linear; you are essentially going from A to B and you cannot divert off the track in anyway. You have to follow your squad leader and that is it. This leaves little opportunity for you to explore the map, and even if you did, there is not much to find anyway. Mostly empty houses with nothing interactive or remotely interesting in anyway.\n\nThe single player mode took me just about five hours to complete; and there is no reason at all for you to play it through more than once, yes you can ramp up the difficulty, but honestly, the harder modes are just as easy. Oh and the multiplayer, I wasn't even able to get into a match since the community is dead. There are very little games, and the ones I could find, were riddled with hackers and aim bots making it pointless even to pick this game up for the multiplayer.\n\nTechnically, I didn't have any problems. I was able to play at 60+ FPS on 4k resolutions all the time. You will need v-sync on but this doesn't effect your frames like other games. There is a good amount of options in the menus to customize the graphics and keybindings too.\n\nIn summary; I don't think I can recommend Medal of Honor for full price, the £14,99 price tag for what is essentially a single player game that lasts about five hours cannot be justified in anyway. If the multiplayer scene was still active I would at least recommend it purely based on that, but it isn't.  I would say if you can get this game for less than £4,99, then pick it up, but not for a penny more.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/47790/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Note: the following review covers only the single player campaign.\n\nThere was a point in time when Medal of Honor was a series that mattered. A franchise born in a time where WWII shooters were still hot and Allied Assault was blowing players and its competition away. But between then and now bolt action rifles and beach stormings have fallen out of fashion, most of the people who made Medal of Honor a respected name among shooters have long since left for other studios, and 2010’s reboot (for lack of a more appropriate term) is left doing the same thing so many other games were a decade or so ago when the series was first kicking off: attempting to ape its peers in the hope of grabbing a slice of the pie.\n\nToday’s analogical pastry is the impossibly large Call of Duty, which along with its innovations in campaign structures and online play brought itself out of the early 20th century and into modern day. Naturally every other military shooter has followed suit, but Medal of Honor is perhaps the first to really attempt to ground itself in the ongoing conflicts happening in the middle east, a decision that could have given its campaign meaning outside of itself and showcased to its players the very real horrors raging on in Afghanistan which somehow still feel so distant.\n\nInstead we end up with exactly what you’d expect from a modern military shooter, except coming along with the added baggage of playing off actual current events, which for all of developer Danger Close’s intentions has only managed to turn the game into a giant mess. It’s not that I expected Medal of Honor to provide any meaningful commentary on the scenarios its portraying, but by marrying its summer action movie mentality to a war that’s still raging and killing thousands it trivializes the losses of American soldiers and innocent Afghans for mindless entertainment.\n\nMedal of Honor is happy to proclaim itself as being “real” only so far as it can manage to fit in a blockbuster sequence of set pieces and explosions, showing you how horrible the things its replicating are one second while reveling in gory headshots and idiotic “bro-speak” the next. It feels emotionally manipulative and tasteless, unwilling to commit to being anything but a dumb action game with as little nuance in presenting its subject matter as that usually entails.\n\nAnd what an unbelievably dumb game Medal of Honor is. Below its terribly handled premise, incoherent plot, and attempts at “gritty realism”, there’s a game that’s terrified of letting you play it. It funnels you through levels with gratuitous levels of restriction, placing invisible walls everywhere so as to always be entirely in control of where you are and where you can go even if it intends to let you there later. You move when it tells you to, shoot where it points you, watch the often malfunctioning scripted sequences sometimes when it makes you, and participate in its series of strict directions because that’s all you can do.\n\nMedal of Honor is so obsessed with being in control that I began to ask why I was even there at all. The game clearly didn’t want me there, as I became one more thing needing to be kept on a leash, in case I potentially walk too far ahead and break another scripting trigger or stumble into an area before it’s had time to spawn its enemies, and I didn’t want to be there because the lack of any player agency made it feel like I was watching a very dull movie that I had to keep moving forward.\n\nBut it’s probably the incompetency with which the game hides any of this that’s the most insulting. There’s never any question that you’re being moved through egregiously linear environments, shooting enemies with zero tactical awareness that pop up like target dummies with guns that never feel right. The game presents itself entirely as it is, as if it hasn’t even enough pride to try and hide its mind numbing tediousness and genericism; to try and pretend it wasn’t plopped out in the hopes of catching hold of Call of Duty’s momentum because it hasn’t a single original idea left for itself. In a way I kind of appreciate this sort of honesty, if only because it’s the only bit of sincerity the game ever shows.","February 2, 2015","false","4.7"," 79 of 130 people (61%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","61","79","130","8","7"

Now, it's a game that will no-one remember and the game that fell short in every aspect it could have.\n\nThe story of MoH itself is uninteresting, undercooked and short. The game can be finished in a mere 5 hours on normal settings, without any, and I mean ANY replay value. There aren't any collectibles, multiple paths or story elements that would encourage the player to start the game all over again. Once you have finished it semi-frustrated there is no going back to it. Frustration is a concept that will many of us have to face in MoH. The super-linear nature of the discourages any way of alternate pathfinding. To put it simple, if you don't do what the game says you to do, you're dead. Don't try to be a hero, as you always have to follow instructions to survive. If you are told to hold position, don't try to peek above the wall, because you are getting shot. If you are told to run or retreat don't try to stay and hold off the enemy as they will kill you...sometimes even behind cover.\n\nNot is all bad about the game however. Two things stand out the most. The graphics are beautiful even on medium settings. Water, rocks, buildings and shadows look astonishing. The other thing where you have to give credit to the creators is trying to maintain authenticity. Places, soldiers, the way they talk to each other, situations all feel real to a person who is inexperienced in war situations. The game itself takes place in Afghanistan and it's plot is loosely based on the Operation Anaconda where US soldiers tried to destroy Taliban forces back in '02.\n\nI can honestly say that I haven't seen a game that would want YOU to rush through it's single player mode. This game does. For one thing its ultra short. Experienced player can finish it in 4 to 5 hours easily, and checkpoints are so frequent that even if you happen to die, you won't be set back for more than 2 minutes of your progress. Literally, a level starts with an in-game cinematic and a shepherd is taken down silently by your fellow soldier, and boom checkpoint. Sometimes it feels like the game throws you a CP every time you reload you weapon. The level design is also horrible, excluding the first few stages, on all of the levels there is 1 hard point where you are so overwhelmed that you will die 3-10 times in 5 minutes. Up until that point and even after that there is little to no resistance. To put it gently, it's unbalanced.\n\nWhen you get frustrated (and you'll get) by the SP you can try the Tier1 mode, which is unlocked once you've completed the SP on any difficulty. Basically, Tier1 is the same as the SP just with some gameplay tweaks, e.g. difficulty is set to hard and you have no restarts. Once you die, you have to start over again. There is a time limit in each level that you have to beat, and headshots will freeze the timer for a couple of seconds. To conserve time there aren't any cutscenes either. This mode really is for hardcore MoH players and I doubt that any of the one-timers will enjoy it.\n\nRating: 47/100; Replay Value: 1/5; To Beat: 5 hours; Played on: normal.","September 14, 2013","false","5.2"," 109 of 190 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","109","190","0","0"

But as said - very rarely.\n\nMultiplayer deserves the ranking of around 5/10, not sure.\nIt mainly suffers from the engine, removal of features (comparing to singleplayer) and strange map and encounter design.","July 27, 2015","true","5.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

Not only does this game come with an amazing storyline but the multiplayer is equally fun to play with friends or even by yourself. Even after completing the story you'll find yourself coming back to play the multiplayer over and over again. Even though its a bit of an older game I find it to feel and look better than most Call of Duty games that have been released in previous years (Especially AW and BO3).

No exploration or side missions.\n- Story, while reasonable, could improve greatly and lift the score for this game.\n- Multiplayer is literally full of young kids. No realism or authenticity here, the guns are awkward to use, the maps unimaginative and it is plagued by the typical problems with multiplayer, like spawn camping. As a whole, it's a boring multiplayer experience.\n\nOverall Score: 7/10\n\nMedal of Honor is a fun singleplayer game and that's probably all you need to know to buy it. Sure, it doesn't last long, but those 7-8 hours are good.

It has some nice pros but it is FAR out weighed by its cons.\n\nPros :\n\n-Some of the best 2010 graphics. Still competes with todays graphics.\n-Solid Sound ( No doubt the strong in this game, coming in with an overal 9.5-10/10 IMO )\n-Decent singleplayer storyline\n-Vehicles ( Very VERY few )\n-Fairly well optimized\n-Doesnt require a high spec rig\n-Cheap\n-Doesn't require Origin\n-Not buggy\n-Weapon customization ( Barely any, but still )\n-Killstreaks\n-Anticheat ( Not the best but it gets the job done )\n-Not alot hackers ( due to the fact that most servers are dedicated with admins kicking )\n-The perfect niche between Call of Duty and Battlefield\n\nCons:\n\n-Some of the worst map design I've seen in a while. Yes ; The maps are worse then Call of Duty maps.\n-Lack of killstreaks ( It is a good thing that the game has them; but the few ones it has are EXTREMLY similiar. )\n-12 Year old community who hackusate everyone on the team for aimbotting or kids who ♥♥♥♥ your mom.\n-Absoulutely horrendous spawns / spawn system. This NEEDS to be revamped.\n-Did I mention the maps?\n-Nade spam\n-Rocket spam ( 3/4 of my deaths at the end of the game are to rockets and or nades alone. This NEEDS to be fixed. )\n-Dying playerbase ( There are a couple servers everyday so that is good / nice, however most will be high ping since there's so few.\n-9/10 servers will be high ping due to the fact that there are so few servers and the chances of ya living close are so slim\n-The nade spam makes Call of Duty look like a good game\n-Crappy looking UI\n-Lack of gun diversity\n-Crap gun customization\n-Little to no vehicles.\n-It's a little grindy.\n-Few maps\n-No medic / ammo classes like in Battlefield\n-Few gamemodes\n-The worst netcode I've ever seen in my life. If you thought Battlefield 4 has a rough release, youre in for a treat. This netcode is easily twice as bad. Imagine Battlefield 4's netcode on release with 1500 Ping... This is it. On top of that, you will usally get 50-200 MS ping per server.\n\nThe reason why this game is recommended by me is because it's so cheap it's worth a buy; IF you manage to find a copy under 10$. Personally, I got a copy for 0.98 $ and I would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if I got it for 1.98$\nHowever, for 0.98$, it is worth every single penny for all the times you die due to ♥♥♥♥ netcode, high ping, terrible map design, nade spam, rocket spam, by the same two guns the game offers, and due to ridiculous killstreaks.\nIf you are into Call of Duty and or Battlefield and want to try something different this is a must buy.","December 29, 2015","true","0.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","0"

There is an unofficial mod, but it's still in beta. Here is the link[community.pcgamingwiki.com]\n\nMedal of Honor 2010 is not a bad game, but it's not really a game that i would recommend\nThe game consists of a singleplayer campaign that was made by Danger Close and multiplayer that was made by DICE\n\nSingleplayer\nCampaign is about the war in Afghanistan. Unlike most shooters nowdays, they decided to focus solely on 1 place and that's a good thing. You don't have this "travel round the world" that most shooters do nowdays, everything happens in 1 location. The other good thing is how they hand over missions to you.\nLike, you start out as marines, during that level you get surrounded and call for air support. 2 Helicopters come to the rescue and drive the enemy away, then you start playing as one of the pilots. By the end of their level, you almost get shot by an RPG, but a friendly sniper team prevents that from happening, now you switch to that sniper team. During the sniper mission, you provide assistance to a friendly unit. Then you switch to that unit.\nUnfortunately, the bad outweighs the good here. Now the game resembles a typical linear corridor shooter, that lasts 4 hrs. Other than that many features that were present in the previous game were tossed out, like choosing a loadout, big open levels, choosing you starting point, upgrades for weapons.\n\nMultiplayer\nIt was made by DICE. It kind of resembles a mix between COD and Battlefield.\nUnlike the singleplayer, it uses Frostbite 1.5(while the singleplayer uses Unreal Engine 3). Though, dispite using Frostbite, the destruction in this game is insignificant.\nIt features 12 maps and 6 modes. And a max player cap of 24 players. Also, it has  a server browser.\n5 maps are used for Team Assault(a.k.a. TDM), Sector Control (a.k.a. Domination) and Objective Raid (a.k.a. Rush)\n3 maps are used for Combat Mission(similar to Rush, but with a vehicle)\n2 Maps for Hot Zone(a.k.a. King of the Hill)\n2 Maps for Clean Sweep(a.k.a. Counter Strike's Defusal)\n\nCombat Mission is probably the main mode of the game. It's kind of like Rush, except that you have 5 objectives, and you defend one at a time. Defenders win if the time limit runs out. Attackers win if they destroy every objective. Talibans are always the defenders and USA are always the attackers. USA also gets a tank(unfortunately, it's only available on 2 maps).\n\nThe game features 3 classes: Rifleman, Special Ops, Sniper.\nRifleman gets access to assault rifles and machine guns. And has smoke grenades and grenade launchers.\nSpecial Ops gets access to shotguns, carbines and SMG's. And has rocket launchers.\nSniper gets access to sniper rifles and C4.\n\nThe leveling up is very similar to battlefield, that means, if you play as say Rifleman, you level up only the Rifleman class. Each class has 15 levels. Now just like in Battlefield, you are stuck with respective weapons for your faction, and to use your enemy's weapons, you must reach the max level.\nThere are a total of 15 weapons in the game. And you have 3 attachment slots for each of them.\n\nNow what it copied from COD are the killstreaks. They aren't really killstreaks though, they are more of a pointstreaks. You can get them just by playing the objective. Now, when you earn a killstreak, you get to choose between either an offensive or defensive killstreak.\n\nThe multiplayer is quite a solid experience, but there just isn't much content here.","April 15, 2014","false","4.9"," 29 of 52 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","29","52","0","0"

Sometimes gameplay was linear, though it don't mind it. What really bothered me, it was the scripted actions. Like, you can't progress the story if don't do some things like going to a specific spot or make a specific action.\n\nBig minus imo, is the duration of the campaign, which is pretty small, so it's only value for money if you can get it on a sale, like 5-6 euro or something and only if you are medal of honor fan.\n\nI liked very much voice actors and music background.\n\nTL;DR\nIf you want to spend an evening, MoH is a nice way to do it, but get as cheaper you can on sale.","December 31, 2014","true","10.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

Extremely Average\n\nAs a long time fan of the franchise, the chance of reboot is an exciting prospect, sadly it'll have to wait for another edition of this title to achieve its pontential.

Shows the beginning of the invasion of Afghanistan by American troops. There's a political message about how bureaucrats in Washington don't know about the situation on the ground. It's minor and isn't heavy handed. But it feels......forced. Characters aren't compelling. There's nothing that makes you attached to them. And there's too many characters. 4 members of Navy Seals, then 4 members of Delta Force, another 4 members of the U.S Army Rangers and finally 4 crew members of Apache gunships. The first half of the game you play as Rabbit, a Navy Seal. Towards the end you switch between the rest of the groups. Story also got me confused when each of the members kept getting seperated from one another.\nOverall 5/10\n\nGameplay\nAverage. Nothing special. Played kinda like CoD but felt better. The only thing that felt weird was sprinting and strafing. I can't quite put my finger on it. But it felt different and uncomfortable for some time. You run out of ammo a lot. But don't worry. You can borrow from your squad members. Also you don't tank enemy fire. Just a few hits and you're out. My favorite part of the game was using a SOFLAM to target enemy position for an AC-130. Felt really good watching the Taliban getting blown by various cannons. Another favorite moment was when your squad is pinned down by an overwhelming enemy force. And everyone of you LITERALLY runs out of ammo. No cover. No ammo. Enemies closing in from all three sides.

It is a shame they don't really let you explore at all though.  You are very much on a rail, closed off from anything you might wish to see... and often even guys holding guns you wish you could grab.  But the visual experience is nice even compared to recent releases IMO Some obvious aged limitations, but it does look very nice.\n\nSound is pretty good as well, decent enough I wanted to turn it up. Some gun sounds were kind of annoying, but they came out well even on some junk speakers I am forced to use lately, I am sure it would sound even better on an HD sound system.  No real audio experience complaints.\n\nThe story is totally boring to me, and I have played better rail shooters (Black comes to mind)  All of the limitations make me frustrated.  I was hoping for more of a multi-path shooter, with varied options for how to progress, not so.  The game is really just a quick action flick stuffed into a game.  At least it looks nice though.\n\nThe variety is nice, and this is way better than the old WW2 MoH games I played even back on what... PSX??  For what it is, it is well made.  You could do worse with your money, but there are much better shooters on steam for less than this at full price.\n\nHonestly, it is not a bad game, but you won't be getting much from multiplayer, and the campaign is very short.\n\nHigh budget quality... but only worth about 5 bucks on today's market.","April 14, 2015","true","6.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","3","4","3","0"

As the story develops you not only get to play as only one single charachter, but many, in many different situations. This is undoubtedly the game's strong point - giving us as players, the chance to relate to, and understand and feel for other charachters as well, something that lacks greatly in other major AAA-titles.\n\nAlbeit the game takes on a different approach, contrasting their previous WW2-installments, this one, given its new take on the series, has its own share of pros and cons. As it's been mentioned, charachter development is top-notch, not to mention the awesome graphics (although the game was released back in 2014) which still looks good up to this day.\n\nDrawbacks are unfortuneately the multiplayer part, with its numerous glitches, bugs, annoying controls and frankly, the lack of interesting content to give a real gameplay value, hence the bad score. Though, it's mentionworthy to say that they tried. And it's gotten even more polished in the sequel, Warfighter (not available on Steam). Another drawback is the feeling of doing the same mission, over and over, close to becoming annoying, but it never get's there (although pretty close). Last but not least, don't expect any long single-player campaign. It might be a short story, totalling around 4-5 hours. But you're into one hell of a ride, so it's by no means an "easy" challenge, to say the least.\n\nI'll give this game 3 solid SEALS out of 5!","January 12, 2014","true","4.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

I played the whole MoH serie since the ps1 games, so I know how it was born and grew.\nThe story is the usual, recycled, already seen soup, which is quite boring and you can skip with no regrets. The problem is that you can only skip movies and not cutsecenes, so if you want to replay the game, you'll have to watch them again and again, and they last for about 50% of the level time.\n\nThe real problem is the gameplay, though. Being used to games that tells you everything you need to push in order to even move, so much that it gets annoying, I was surprised that this game tells you nothing at all. Well, it tells you what to push to move and jump, the basics that everyone already knows, but not how to use the special equipment you're supposed to use in the "mini-games". Ok, there's no mini-games here, but there's special sequences where you need to use a special binocular to mark targets for bombing, a sequence where you use the weaponry of an helicopter, and some sniper sequences. Well, on the first 2 modes you have more than 1 firing mode but the game doesn't tell you that, and you end up wondering why certain targets don't blow up, or why the game keeps telling you to do something that you're already doing.\nThe actual FPS mode is sub-par, too. You can't choose what weapons you start the mission with, and you can only collect enemy weapons (not ammo to refill your one, unless it's the same model) or ask your friends for ammo, if they use the same one as yours.\nThe action has so many little breaks because you either have to climb a 1.5 meters step with the help of a teammate, something exploded near you and you take a whole 15 seconds to get on your feet again, a whole lot of enemies arrived at a near position (so it's better to just look at them instead of firing, right?), the teammates has something to tell you, and so on. It's frustrating. The fact that the game is also an on-rail shooter, with no space for exploration and only one way from point a to point b, makes the SP experience feel so restricting and unsatisfying, that the fact that it only last 3 hours won't bother you so much at the end.\nYes, you've read it right, 3 hours. That is about how much it took me to complete this game.\nIt wasn't even so much fun for those 3 hours. The game plays the compassion card for all the soldiers that actually went into those places, risking their life for our freedom. Well I'm sorry, but there's already movies for that and when I buy a game I want a game, not a barely interactive movie. I'm sorry for those people and I really appreciate their work, and I think it's not honest to use their sacrifice to make bad games.\n\nThe only thing that barely saves this game from being a complete disaster are the graphics. I get a solid 60fps in full-hd and everything at max, with vsync on, but it only looks good during daylight missions (like with most games anyway), and even there there's part of the graphics that is too blocky and/or has bad textures, but it's overall pretty good looking.\nThe audio is a mess, though. The sound can barely be heard and you have to increase the volume at almost maximum in your audio equipment.\n\nOh yeah, there's an additional game mode in SP, where you fight your way in a selected level for leaderboard score. Such fun.\nIf only they added coop, that could have marginally saved this terrible game, but as it is, it's the usual EA game: just bad.","October 13, 2014","false","3.7"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","18","34","0","0"

I expected to spend 15 minutes playing and then go on to something else. What I found was something amazing.\n\nMoH's single player is gritty and real. It embodies the harshness of the conflict and twines together the story of different squads interacting in the Afghan conflict perfectly. One moment you are waiting for evac and helicopters clear out the landing zone and then break off to hit another target - to which you transition to the next mission as that helicopter gunner.\n\nThe audio is visceral. I got shot at in a village and flinched when a metal wall next to me was peppered with bullets. I can't remember the last time I've reacted to a game in such a way - and that is a great thing.\n\nMoH is a complete experience. I wish it lasted longer as I was able to complete the campaign in around 6 hours but it was worth every minute.","April 15, 2012","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is generic to the max. It's like they looked at Battlefield and Call of Duty, distilled the basic features out of them, and stripped out any unique or iconic gameplay. It really feels like CoD with less recoil and no soul.\n\nI've tried both multiplayer and the campaign, but I'll be mostly reviewing the campaign. One thing I'll say about multiplayer - unless they've changed this, snipers start with no scopes, and you have to spend two hours getting spawn-killed and shooting one enemy per life to earn a crappy scope.\n\nAgain, the campaign is uber-generic. You are a soldier in a special ops unit. You get briefed on objectives you don't care about, and are thrown into some fighting. Your guns have no recoil. Occasionally you get a slow-motion event.\n\nThe missions aren't even put together well. There is a sniping mission where you work alongside a veteran sniper, an obvious attempt to copy the flashback mission in Modern Warfare, but executed so badly you'll be failing repeatedly while trying to figure out what he wants you to do. Everything has an extremely linear layout, but there are couple of places where it's still easy to get lost because the level doesn't flow well.\n\nSeveral missions are extremely frustrating or repetitive, or both. One mission has you sniping enemy soldiers on a hill. They're pretty far away, in some trees, and you can't see jack ♥♥♥♥. You sit there and wait for your spotter to call out someone, try in vain to figure out where the target is, and then lose. But in the end you'll get it down because they keep spawning at a handful of locations.\n\nThe most memorable moment for me was a mission where I was halfway through the level, and a scripted event had us pinned down by enemy MGs. An ally ordered me to provide covering fire with my own light MG so they could move up. But... I dropped my MG at the beginning of the level for a different weapon. So I tried to provide covering fire with my AK. Over and over. Time after time, I wasted entire magazines, but my allies didn't do anything. I tried shooting the enemy gunners, which should have been easy because they weren't very far away, but they were invulnerable. I looked all around the area but there was no LMG available. Finally I realized I could try to pop a grenade in the MG nest. That took a few tries to do without dying, but when I finally got a grenade in there, I was rewarded with... nothing.\n\nThey seriously made a scripted event halfway through the level where you have to have an LMG to continue, but don't force you to keep the LMG from the beginning of the level and don't give you one when you need it. I had to replay the entire level with the LMG just to be able to pass that part.\n\n♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game design.","January 1, 2014","false","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's the first Medal of Honor I played, and I must say it has lessened my respect for all parties involved, including Humble for giving this more attention than it deserves.\nThis game doesn't have any redeeming qualities I could come up with. Gameplay is bad, execution is bad, pacing is bad, sound design is bad, everything else is bad. It's just junk, and it reminded me why I was reluctant to play war shooters in the first place. You can feel that they tried pretty hard to clone Call of Duty (I mean, just look at the title, duh). Even the description on Steam is involuntarily hilarious. "...a relatively unknown entity of handpicked warriors"? Who writes stuff like that with a straight face?\nIt's a persiflage of its own subject matter. The realistic enactment of war simply shouldn't be treated in a way like this, it's inadvertently offensive and cheap. Although I feel bad for giving a bad review for a game I paid almost zero $ for, I'm still desperate to warn everyone about giving this game a chance. If you have to, take Call of Duty on for another playthrough, it's still better after the third time than this is during any given 30 minutes of its awful campaign.\nPlease note that I never played any Medal of Honor multiplayer, it may well be its singular redeeming quality, since there must be a reason for it to exist at all.

Despite the fact that the game plays nearly identically to the Call of Duty Modern Warfare games, Medal of Honor is actually from EA (makers of Battlefield). If you have this game, you probably got it as part of the Humble Origin Bundle from a year or so back (bunch of great games in that one). Like the Call of Duty games, MOH is split into Multiplayer and Single player installations, which means you can download just one or the other if you’re only planning to play through the campaign (like me). There is a separate Steam entry for each.\n\nThe story of MOH follows a couple of Navy Seal teams in Afghanistan trying to root out Al Qaida / Taliban soldiers, mostly taking place in the mountains. You also switch to playing a member of a squad of Army Rangers for a couple of missions, and see the war from a different perspective. MOH is very story driven, and since you’re almost always in a squad, you can count on the other members of your team to support you when you’re under heavy fire. However if you get shot enough you’ll die and reload the checkpoint. Your team doesn’t “revive” you like in some other squad based games (Payday, Left 4 Dead). Gameplay is very much like Call of Duty Modern Warfare where you’re supposed to do most of the heavy lifting while the rest of your team kind of picks off a few enemies occasionally and provides ammo.\n\nMOH has the regenerating health system as expected in most modern first person shooters, with the screen edges turning red as you are taking damage and then clearing up if you don’t get shot for a few seconds. This means that a lot of the time you can risk making a run without cover and take some hits as long as you don’t die. You can also pick up the weapons of fallen enemies, though you should almost always keep your primary assault rifle (with the silencer when available).  An interesting gameplay element as mentioned above is that if you run low on ammo, you can always ask a computer controlled squad mate for more. I don’t remember this being available in many other first person games.\n\nPros:\n+Pretty good graphics and engrossing story. If you like Call of Duty type shooter games, you should like MOH. I believe the game’s story is based on actual events.\n+A lot of gameplay variety. You can occasionally control aerial bombardment (as an attack helicopter pilot) or heavy direct fire aircraft (blowing up stuff with big guns!). The sniper/stealth sections are fun as well.\n\nCons:\n-The game is really short. It can take less than 5 hours to beat the campaign if you’ve played the game before. For a game this short it takes up a lot of hard drive space.\n-There is at least 1 mission where it can be difficult to tell where you’re supposed to go. Your squad leader gives you an order and it isn’t immediately obvious what you’re supposed to do. Also, more than once I got stuck due to a game bug where an event didn’t trigger the way it was supposed to (marking a spot for air strike).\n\nOverall Medal of Honor is a fun game to go through in a weekend, and get a feel for what highly trained combat soldiers have to do for a living. If you’ve seen the recent Mark Wahlberg movie “Lone Survivor” this game has a similar feel (elite soldiers surrounded by enemies).\n\nSequel info:\nMOH Warfighter is exclusive to EA Origin (no Steam version). I got my copy as a physical DVD so I didn’t have to go through the process of downloading it through Origin.\n\nInstall size: Less than 20 gigabytes\nPlaytime: about 6 hours for single player\n\nIn Warfighter, you play a new member of the same group of Navy Seals as in the first game, but with a few new additions to your team. The action takes place in several regions all over the world (Philippines, Middle East, etc.) unlike the first game, where you were in Afghanistan the whole time. There are also a bunch of cutscenes following a few characters in their “off-duty” life in the United States (kind of boring). The general plot of the game though, is chasing down terrorists before they execute their complicated plans of blowing stuff up.\n\nThe game is very similar to the first MOH (as expected) and  it uses the Frostbite 2 game engine, which was featured in Battlefield 3. The graphics are VERY good and almost photo realistic at times. Unfortunately, this means that some computers may not be able to run the game at a decent frame rate. I found an issue where I would have horribly low frames per second at certain parts of the game, and it turned out that it was due to Origin downloading free map packs in the background (Zero Dark Thirty map pack was about 900 megabytes). When I stopped the downloads the game sped up. If you liked MOH1, you’ll like Warfighter.\n","February 4, 2015","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I remember the largest criticism being in the choice to be able to play as the Taliban in the multiplayer. I didn't play the multiplayer, so that hasn't hindered my review of this game.\n\nIn this reboot of the classic WWII series, the game is set in Afghanistan in very late 2001 and March 2002; being loosely based on Operation Anaconda, more specifically, the Battle of Shah-i-Kot and Battle of Takur Ghar. Takur Ghar is a mountain in the Shah-i-Kot Valley in Southeast Afghanistan where, at the time, Taliban and Chechan forces had dug themselves in with well over 500 forces encamped throughout the region.\n\nThe game's plot revolves around a number of soldiers from the Navy SEALs and various regiments from the US Army, such as the US Rangers and the Aviation Regiment. While a number of the characters don't actually meet, they help each other out at certain points during the game, like at one point, the Rangers are pinned down and the Aviation forces swing in to help them out. Then you take over as the Aviation team to sweep the area. The story is rather simple, sweep the area of enemy forces and, at times, the Navy SEALs are actually gathering intelligence, scouting forces ahead for the Army. Not an amazing story, but the amount of research the team put forward when it came to the accuracy of how many casualties were actually lost on the US side during the battles and the specific locations and tracking the troops movement from real life to fiction was neat. Basically, I applaud the effort with the research even if the story is dry.\n\nTechnical side, the games graphics are nice, but the AI on your side can get stuck at points and you might have to reload to a prior checkpoint, or worse, restart the whole level, that happened once. Some of the shadows bug out, but it wasn't that noticeable. Sound design is nice. Orchestra score is good, my only complaint that actually annoyed me was the soundtrack with like, Linkin Park. I hate Linkin Park. Seriously.\n\nMy only other serious complaint is that at some points of the game, apparently every muslim is an enemy and end up being killed by the US Army. Sure enough, in the game, everone you encounter is an enemy except from the first mission where you drive through a town and see some people, like the guy herding his goats across the street. It was a pretty big village and maybe I half expected to see a woman or child out in the streets, but there weren't any, so it became apparent that everyone you'd encountered at that point would become your enemy, which was very much the case. There wasn't any perspective as to who the civilians were or could be. And even the Northern Alliance, the Afghan army that the US had allied with, barely make an appearance. Instead, they're friendly fired upon by an angry guy in Langley. That was just like a WTF moment. I know some of that happened in real life, but it seemed a bit overkill here.\n\nStill, a few minor complaints from an overall good FPS.\n\n8.0/10","August 26, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/47790/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","In Medal of Honor, brotherhood is an unspoken bond of trust and companionship through acts of honor where failing to leave a soldier behind isn’t an option and risking one’s life for the fate of another is common. The idea of brotherhood created Medal of Honor’s storyline, and it is the best storyline I have ever played in a tactical FPS thus far. Just like any FPS fan, I too become overly ecstatic about this genre: I can talk hours upon hours about it, give you my critical opinions down to exquisite detail, and discuss creative and strategic ways to deceive opponents online. And so, I wasn’t expecting much out of Medal of Honor considering how popular titles like Modern Warfare 2 have already set a nearly untouchable standard for the FPS genre, and I couldn’t foresee any title that was able to compete with that.\n\nHowever, none have captured a story which is deep enough to really connect the player to the game’s storyline... until now. Although incredibly short, MoH’s campaign is done well and that’s an understatement. You play three different roles: Rabbit and Deuce, who are Tier 1 operatives, and Dante Adams, who is an Army Ranger. Usually, players are not able to become attached to the characters when the protagonist switches too many times and too quickly. But here, it works because it follows the concept of brotherhood mentioned above, covering what other popular shooters are missing in their campaign: a theme and the consistency of building a story around that theme.\n\nFurthermore, you’re thrown into a variety of scenarios. Everything that you could possibly imagine that takes place in a war is in MoH’s single-player campaign, such as being ambushed by waves of enemies or being nearly obliterated by a hidden bomb. And what would you do if you jumped out of a helicopter and only had your knife as a weapon? It’s full of intense action through and through—enough that you don’t want to put the controller down.\n\nSecond, the game’s details are remarkable: Dust from the ground spits up from bullet fire, strobes continuously flash on your teammate’s shoulder when you switch to night-vision indicating who is a friendly, and even the sound of gunfire is different depending on where you are. Inside a wrecked plane, the bullets from a light machine gun has a tin-like sound with a subtle echo. Little details like these make you feel like you’re in a realistic battle.\n\nAnother feature that emphasizes realism is the communication between you and your AI teammates. Throughout the story, you’re directly spoken to and you’re given orders without any abrupt pop-up hints of where to go next. You’ll hear things like, “Rabbit, take the path at your six…” and “Go loud on Rabbit”, indicating what your next move should be. This is extremely effective since you learn to listen closely as well as learn how to be part of a team, making you much more involved in the combat.\n\nOnce you finish the campaign, Tier 1 mode is unlocked, where you aim to beat a level within a given time. That’s not all: There aren’t any checkpoints, so if you die, you start over; health regenerates slower; auto-aim assist and weapon’s crosshairs are disabled; and you cannot resupply on ammo from your allies. And need I emphasize the time limit? If you execute “skill kills”, like headshots and melee kills, then the clock temporarily stops. If the level is completed successfully, you earn a spot on the global leaderboards.\n\nDespite how amazing the story is, there are several flaws in its gameplay. There are few texture problems where some buildings or environments take time to load while AI characters, who are standing in place, shift abruptly. As for the AI, my teammates at times ran into my line of fire - I promise I was not actually shooting them. And the enemy AI is not much of a concern as they are terribly predictable. In turn, they do become challenging to fight against on certain levels where they attack in groups or waves. My AI teammates despite being drawn to my line of fire are also very effective in killing the enemy without any of my help.\n\nMedal of Honor’s minor weakness is its multiplayer. There are five different modes, three of which are objective-based: capturing and defending different points on the map. The other two consists of team deathmatch and hardcore. And let's not even go through the whole Taliban/Opposing Forces thing, or this review will never end. Just like single campaign, teamwork is crucial especially in objective games, like Objective Raid, where your goal is to defend two bases from the opposing team who has a goal to arm it and destroy it. In order to defend both bases, your team must spread out or the match could end in less than a minute.\n\nThe gameplay itself is entertaining especially considering that several playlists offer up to 24 players, but just like the game modes, the maps lack variety. There are eight in total and they feature valleys, mountains, and marketplaces, which more or less look the same to me, and they all feature a monochromatic scenery, making the maps rather bland. I couldn’t understand how the single campaign has such diverse terrain with colorful scenery while the maps in multiplayer do not.\n\nLike I said in the beginning, I wasn’t expecting much out of Medal of Honor, but I was more than satisfied. While the multiplayer has its cons, it definitely has potential to be built into something more. The single-player campaign is enough to hold anyone through a gripping story with non-stop and fast-paced action and a trio of compelling characters. I should also mention that MoH is dedicated to America’s servicemen and I think it’s a job well done, no matter what the military bases say. Medal of Honor is one game you should be playing and one game that is now in competition with the rest.","March 9, 2014","true","9.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Maybe I was just too late to the party and expected a modern up to date shooter, but that's not what this is.  The AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  The sound is just plain awful, insulting.  The gun mechanics are sloppy and unrealistic.  The visuals are flat and unconvincing.  This shooter isn't even worth $5.  That's particularly evident when games that have good single play and multi play components can be had for as little as $5 at times (get BF3 on sale, or even BF2).

Basically, it's pretty graphics and not much else. The gameplay is meh.... You're forced along a very strict path with glass walls if you try to stray even slightly.  There's one great scene where you approach a small village in an Apache (that you don't control, you just hold down m1+m2 and it shoots stuff), and they just say "Everyone is hostile here. Kill EVERYTHING" and you destroy every building in a village, undoubtedly killing children and civilians. There are lots of short easy gun battles between scripted events. The SEALs will tell you stuff like "be really really quiet here, we want to be sealthy". So you can, if you want, sneak along and kill nobody, or you can fire a few shots into the air, and your team will kill everyone for you. The controls are also screwed up too. For example, there was a mission where you're in a helicopter and all of a sudden you need hellfire missiles to take out a mortar, and the button for hellfire missiles isn't left click, right click, melee, grenade, or any of those keys, even though the last two of those are pointless in a helicopter. Instead, you have to hold down 4 for 2 seconds, even though there's nothing that binds 4 to any action.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KeptYouWaitingHuh/recommended/47790/","KeptYouWaitingHuh","戦FøxNull士","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KeptYouWaitingHuh/","517 products in account","Medal of Honor is a reboot of the classic WWII franchise and is set within the modern day conflict in the middle east. The story campaign tries to focus on the epic yet somewhat cliche'd story of a group of special forces soldiers doing super secret missions and the like, we've heard that all before. But what makes Medal of Honor different from other games in the genre is it tries to maintain a realistic, gritty war atmosphere with its authentic and fantastic sounds, real-world weapons and most controversially the taliban. While some may pass on the single player due to its "been there done that" feeling thanks to call of duty, it isnt half bad, and is recommended for anyone looking for a good time. But where the game really shines is in its multiplayer, taking the authentic sound and feel of the game into the online battlefield. The modes feature capture point, attack and defend, and elimination among a few others. The graphics and sound are great and while multiplayer is fun to play, it does suffer a bit from little customization of weapons and characters, set classes, and frustrating hitbox detection. Even so the game does manage to be fun and is something different if you're looking for something other than call of duty or battlefield. Just stay away from its sequel.\n\n> PROS\nGreat graphics and phenominal sound\nDecent single player campaign\nVariety of online modes\nAuthentic feel\n\n> CONS\nBullet sponge enemies and annoying hitboxes\nFew maps to choose from\nSmall amount of online players\nHackers online can ruin matches\nCliche'd story\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Pretty Good\nMedal of Honor is what you'd get if you merged Battlefield and Call of Duty together, and its pretty good. The multiplayer is a refreshing and authentic alternative to call of duty but not quite big enough to be its big brother battlefield.\nRecommended 8/10\n","February 21, 2014","true","9.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ahoopyfrood/recommended/47790/","ahoopyfrood","AHoopyFrood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ahoopyfrood/","366 products in account","I went into Medal of Honor expecting another gritty, brown, cover-shooting FPS, clicking away until the brown terrorist hiding behind brown rocks stop moving. What you get is, well, that but not nearly as deary and grinding as I had anticipated and even did some things pretty well. Maybe it's because it's been a few years since I've played a single player modern military shooter.\n\nFirst off, the campaign is head scratchingly short. For a series that has always focused on single player it's a little puzzling that so much time and money was put into a 3-5 hour campaign. That being said, short is better than long and grindy. There is a good mix of stealth based and all out war game play, with vehicle and sniper sections scattered through out that keep things fresh. You jump between three view points that tie together nicely whcih prevents the transitions from being jarring. One of the things that I thought they did well was conveying the uncertainty of who is a target and who is a civilian, or even a friendly. I do think they missed an opportunity to put those decisions on the player, as most of those situations occur in either scripted sections or cut scenes, but still, it didn't go unnoticed.\n\nThere were a few more details that helped lift this game a bit above mediocre. The guns felt varied and solid, although the shotgun is overpowered, and headshots look and sound satisfying. My favorite detail was the sound design. There's this really cool thing when you're standing near a squad member who's speaking and you can hear their voice both through the radio and normally. It doesn't actually effect anything but it's a nice detail that's realistic and helps with immersion and makes me wonder why I haven't heard it in more games.\n\nThere's no reason to run out and buy this at full price but if modern FPSs are your thing or you get the chance at a good price it's worth a quick play through. A note on the value: I didn't play more than just loading into a couple of games but the multiplayer is still up and running and there were players. You may need to go into the settings file and force the DirectX to version 9. There's also what they call Tier 1 mode which is just leader boards for completing the campaign levels while hitting or beating various statistical goals (time, accuracy, melee kills, etc).","January 6, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However this game to me is a great make. Medal of Honor brought their kind of "Modern Warfare" to the table. I read all of these negative reviews but at least in this game we are fighting against Americas real enemy, terrorism. Here we dont see our nation being torn apart by Russia like in Call of Duty. This game brings you an experience I seem to feel is similar to the movie "Act of Valor". The high speed and precise actions that you as the player need to make, that quick head shot while breaching a room has not been as satisfying in any other game to me but this one. Military experience backing me on this no game is real, not one no matter Arma or anything.

Then the arbitrary, no matter what you do you're screwed plots began, intermixed with the cliche'd slow-motion "You just got blown up" scenes. I despise linear games with predestined outcomes, and I really hate getting deep into a game, then no matter how well I play, or even how poorly, my character is destined to be captured/killed/blown-up/eaten by aliens, etc. I played all of the original MOH games years ago. I have to say I'm not impressed with how this one has evolved to become like COD, a bunch of short chapters played by different characters with different names.  That being said, the game doesn't suck. It's just written like many games are these days. "We want you to see how GREAT we are at plots, so we're going to force your character into mandatory actions".  Oh and, as for the flamers and fan-boys who can't bear to hear any negative comments, blow me! I paid my money, I'm entitled to my opinion. I've been gaming for 30 years so I think I've seen enough games to differentiate between good, mediocre and bad. I'll still give this a thumbs-up, but the game could definitely be better.  If you like games with areas that are like the old side-scrollers, then you won't mind sitting back for anywhere from 30 seconds to two minutes as your character does things that you can't control. As for me, I think it REALLY interrupts the gameplay. I doubt I'll by MOH Airborne on steam. I have it on DVD, and I really don't want to see what they've done to it.","January 3, 2014","true","12.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

So good on them.\n\n\nCons:\n-Shallow.\n-Little replayability.\n-On rails.\n-Poor AI.\n-Graphics.\n-EA?\n\nMildly offensive considering the mindless shooter shell the whole product is wrapped in so tightly.\nThe developers tried to act like this was "realistic."\nThey actually interviewed vets... supposedly.\nThen they set out bragging about how they actually interviewed vets.\n\nWhich means they spent more money advertising that they put the smallest quantity of research possible into the subject matter than they did actually researching the topic.\n\nWhich must be why super sonic 12.7x99mm NATO cartridges can be fired without the audible crack that would have alerted every swinging ♥♥♥♥ in the village, from the back of an ATV, at 600M, with sub MOA precision. Even with the argument that the modified M82, fitted with a suppressor, may have been firing custom sub-sonic ammunition, the sound a .50 BMG bullet would make on impact would be loud enough to wake the dead. The player is permanently in the "hero" one man army roll. The game is tailored to serve as a form of masturbation for childish delusions of grandeur with regards to wars, what they are like, and how they are fought.\n\nThis attitude is highlighted by scenes such as a U.S. Operator rolling a grenade into a room before checking to make sure that there are no civilians present. Which stands out as odd considering that there are confirmed “allies” and civilians in the village. Or several scenes in which supposed JSOC Operators are engaged in MOUT Ops, at night, and have NEVER heard of limited-penetration tactics. Nope. They all just run in through the fatal funnel in bullet time, every time. This could be explained away as the characters being aware that their health will regenerate over time.\n\nThe "Support the Troops" closing message honestly comes off as offensive when placed at the tail end of a mindless, on rails, Michael Bay style, shooter.\n\nThat being said, the game might just be your cup of tea for a lazy afternoon. Especially for real virtual grunts of the digital age. One afternoon is about how long it will take most players to clear the campaign. If you ARE considering purchasing the game, it is highly advisable that you wait for a sale.","November 19, 2014","false","6.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

You never get the feeling of pressuring the trigger of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ PKM and your hits, they simply don't matter. You won't get the satisfaction you get when you lined up headshots in MW.\n- Story is non-existant. "These are the bad guys, we are the good guys. Kill them."\n- They added a long ♥♥♥ ATV driving+stealth section in the game, but ATV feels like a toy car. It simply stops right away when you press "S", it won't be affected by the rocks on the road.\n- Stealth is much more worse. The enemy will look you right in the eyes and won't see you, because you're supposed to be hidden at that moment.\n- You cannot avoid game logic. The game wants you to go to some point, you have to. Do you want to go back because there was a nice sniper spot there? Too ♥♥♥♥ing bad loser, the door you kicked in and broke off from its hinges is fully repaired and for some reason you can't kick it down again. The only thing that works right in Afghanistan is its door makers it seems.\n- Enemies spawn constantly if you're "not supposed to" kill them. And in some places they respawn right in the same spot, right in front of your eyes. Even if you're unloading a big fat PKM upon the spawn point. Hilarious.\n- Too damn easy. I am just a decent FPS player, not that good, not that bad, just around the average. I have to say it, hardest difficulty in this game is no better than playing MW1(CoD4) on lowest difficulty.\n- Glitches. Too damn many glitches. The reason I stopped playing was some glitch that kept me from progressing. If I had a way of finding the chapter name, so I could look for a solution, but there wasn't any indication of it. I thought the game isn't worth the trouble.\n- I have read that the game ends in 4 hours. EA, DICE and Danger Close (Who the ♥♥♥♥ are these guys?) just went somewhat indie with this game and made two interns and a cow to work on this game I assume.\n\nIf you want a decent story (although they ♥♥♥♥ed it up with MW3 I'd say) with modern warfare, your first choice should be the Modern Warfare (Pripyat... a better mission than this whole game combined) trilogy, this should be the last.\n\nTerrible/10","November 4, 2015","false","2.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","2"

The characters are boring. Seems like everybody is a hardened white commando from about the same background and with the same attitude and feelings about everything except for one black commander who might as well be white and one white general or CIA guy or something who should be a lot better actor. The sound is bad. There's lots of err... homoerotic commando whispering in your ear as you stealthily follow the one and only path to "penetrate" your next objective like Dorothy for instance. I like it but the whispering voice sounds the same way no matter if that commando is in front of you, behind you or fifty feet in front of you. And your name keeps changing as you switch identities for no apparant reason. The cities aren't much bigger than farms. The guy directing you often tells me to do things but I have trouble following his instructions. It helps to press H so that your objective lights up for a little while. Its not really that important because there aren't any different ways to go but it took me some time to figure that out.\n\nQuite a few times I've been unable to progress and been forced to restart a mission. I'm often annoyed with the game choosing my weapon. Can't I be allowed to make any decisions? I've played other games that allow me to pick weapons  and choose paths and my name. That's how I prefer it. This game doesn't allow a lot of freedom in allowing you to pick what you'll do next or how you'll do it and its very repetitious. There's one mission where you are taking cover in some crumbling mud shack and the enemy streams in forever down the hills around you. It just gets tiring picking them off. Hard to believe they would waste that many guys on that pathetic tactic but I suppose it could happen.\n\nWhat's going on with that Barret sniper rifle view? Its like they mounted a camera on the back of a camel walking on rocky terrain in high winds.\n\nThe graphics are good and there's a lot of action. Its not as good as taking a walk but its better than raking leaves. This game is not sleep inducing. It'll tire you out but it will also make you feel restless and and angry. If you need to fall asleep I recomend Eurotruck simulator.","November 11, 2014","false","12.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Great looks, great playability, different game mechanics... But it is just another CoD. I actually bought it because I thought i was NOT going to be like that, not another massive, commercial, non-gamer oriented, boring, empty and soulless FPS.\n\nThe campaign is really boring and repetitive, too lineal, very unoriginal and really, really short and easy even on the hardest setting. I finished it with just 5 hours of playtime (and I repeated the first missions a few times due to some hardware problems). So, if you're looking for a nice singleplayer experience, this is not what you're looking for.\n\nIf MP is your thing, then... dont buy it either. Its nothing special. If you like AAA military FPS, get any CoD or Battlefield. Basically the same thing but with many more players online, although here you might find less 13-year-olds screaming at their mics or hackers.

(Single player review, normal difficulty, This review doesn't include multiplayer or Tier 1 mode.)\n\n\nMy entire playthrough of this game which was a short 4 hours of my life, I didn't enjoy this game at all. I liked and appreciated small things in this game. But that was it, I expected a generic shooty game, and a generic shooty game it was.\n\nWith a disgustingly short campaign mode anyways.\n\nIt was 4... let that sink in. FOUR hours long, probably because this is like a Call of Duty thing where people actually only buy it for the Multiplayer, which I can understand. But dear god. FOUR hours. I was watching the end credits before I knew it and all I could think was "no. No this can't ALREADY be over." But yeah. IIIIITTTT was.\n\nAnywho, the gameplay. It's a generic shooty game, I don't really know what else to say. You have gun, you use said gun to kill hostile people. You win game. That's pretty much it.\n\nThere was very little gun variation, the maps were all boring to me, the combat was boring, missions were boring, nothing new, all boring.\n\nThe things I appreciated in this game was some small gun-attention details, like how if I reload with a bullet still in the chamber, my full bullet count is one over the typical full-magazine reload. And I appreciated how relaxed the voices are in the game. Because in real life, that's how it is. No gravely-speaking men all the time all angry and always eager to show who's south pole's bigger on the mic or on the battle-field for that matter.\n\nButttt... yeah. Really all I have to say nicely about this game, it was a boring disappointment to me from start to end. I was hoping, that even though I expected a generic shooter. That it'd be a little bit more different of a approach to a fps shooter, but i'm sorry I did.\n\nThe thing that probably annoyed me the most is when they threw me in a helicopter in a first-person camera in the drivers seat. I was so excited. I thought I was going to be flying that thing around for that mission. Nope. It was a rollercoaster ride where I just left-clicked on people and sometimes right-clicked if they were being extra mean than their ak-47 wielding fellows.\n\nI really don't want to write a honest review that covers the bases for this game. If you want a shooty game, just go get the next CoD or something, it'll have at least zombies or aliens or something. And endless multiplayer matches. As opposed to an older title like this.\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading. I don't really blame you if this didn't help your decision to make a purchase or not. Sorry about that, but have a good day.","September 28, 2014","false","7.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

But the game feels like a teaser for Battlefield 3, the single player is embarrassingly short, and the multiplayer has a laughably small upgrade system (There are 2 team specific guns per class and then an extra one you can unlock). It looks like Battlefield, plays like a cross of BF3 and COD, and then comes up short in content. It's like paying to play a demo. Get it cheap? Worth the couple hours of playtime you will get.

Even though the bundle was completely worth buying it, installing this game wasn't. I have only played the single player game which runs on a different engine than the multiplayer's but I won't bother with it.\n\nStory wise, it is a short campaign (4-5h at max) with no replayability because everything is so lineal that apart from beautiful enviroments it doesn't have enough motivation to even finish it.\n\nThe single player uses a console-like FOV and there is no way to change it. It feels zoomed (like if you play the whole game looking through a scope) and therefore it's very uncomfortable to play for more than 20min.\n\nAnother negative point is mouse sensitivity. By default, MOH has mouse acceleration set to true which you can change but there is also some weird thing about sensitivity. Even on the lowest setting your aim moves faster than most people would desire. You can lower your dpi to solve this if you have a margin for that, obviously.\n\nOverall you're better off watching a movie like Black Hawk Down or Lone Survivor if you want some action.","January 5, 2014","false","5.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","1"

This is good in that it directs the story in the direction that the writers want it to go. I like rail shooters, Half Life is a rail shooter, by definition.\n\nThe Shooting controls.\nYAY SOMEONE GOT IT RIGHT! The way it is set up, by default, is how I, and other pro FPS players, have our controls (mostly).\nCrouch and sprint whilst the button is depressed, not on toggle. Rifle Zoom on Rcklick, also on toggle. WOOT WOOT! Really this is only a little thing as it can usually be changed in the keyboard settings, but I didn't have to change it, for once. Would have been nice if melee was mapped to F, tho. (usually I would have it on E, but that was needed for peeking, which didn't feel as good as the Dishonoured's version)\n\nThe Stealth/Knifing - there were about 6 opportunites to employ this, if you wanted to. Which is reasonable for a gun-focussed campaign. The stealth itself was only OK... you had to kill in the prescribed order, if you went off the script, everyone is alerted and it devolves into a gun fight. I also feel that the enemies hit harder during the stealth sections if you stuffed it up and started a gun fight, as an incentive to do it the way the writers wanted you to. You could run behind someone and they would not hear you. But stealth the wrong guy (or the right guy in the wrong order) and he'd alert the whole base.\n\nHealth bar - was a fast-regenerating red mist that surrounds the vision, similar to CoD, I believe, but better in that it only took a couple of hits (3?) before I was restarting at the checkpoint. Good and bad.The mechanic suited the game andt he fast-paced storyline.\n\n\nEnemies - these would flank and attack, and dive for cover, the AI seemed fine, their accuracy was acceptable. Exept the snipers.\n\nSniping (Barret sections)\nThese were pretty good. You had wind, bullet travel time, and an IR camera to deal with.everything was there except the recoil. Oh there is one bit where you are sniping and your spotter is calling shots. He does a fairly hopeless job of it. and their snipers are useless shots. Then they had Dragonov's VS our Barret.\n\nRun-And-Gun (the story proper)\nMostly fine, sections of running to find cover, picking your shots, and not getting shot or grenaded in the process. You can always ask your allies for more ammo if you're out, too - which is kinda nice. There are some points (you will realise them when it happens) where eventually you realise the enemies have infinite respawn, and the nex event is actually triggered by you moving up closer to the enemy stronghold.  I didn't really like that mechanic. Nor did I like the absolute reliance on Air support to take out dug-in targets such as AA turrets and mortar fire. What would the Rangers do without the Airfoce, I wonder? Hmmm... drop a grenage instead of a signal flare, I imagine.\n\nStory Telling:\nI didn't like how you were constantly being told parts of the story through different Character's eyes. At least, I didn't like how it was done in this game. Usually when this is done, it creates some extra layer of depth to the game, due to the new character having a different mechanic, such as Raven in MSG2  Where you swithced from gun play to sword play. In this, when you change guys, you swap your M4 for (I dunno, some other full auto assault rifle. I plead ignorance). There wasn't really enough difference in each character to truely make each one feel unique. It really was just more of the same as the other guy buy now they are calling me something different when they talk to me.\n\nThe story: (no spoilers)\nWas a nod to the boys on the ground, their trials, and their hardships. This was done in the outworking of the story, quite well. not really a spoiler, but if you don't want any clues about the game story at all... "Bullets or bones? Bones heal... Jump!" would be my favourite line in the movie/game. Their desperation felt sincere, That's a rare thing in gaming story lines. I feel like it was a pity the game was only 5h long, but it told the story they wanted it to, without drawing it out - which maight actually leave you feeling cheated if it went on 'forever' and that ending was the one that you got. it was a good length for the story that was told. Just the game itself was well done and felt a bit short, if only because I wanted a bit more of the exellent game play,\n\nThere are more things I could comment on, I guess, like the part where you play the Apache Gunner, which served well if only to break the gameplay up and provide some variety. but really, everything about this game was good to OK, and worth a play through. I think I got this either for $4 on special, or in a bundle, So i can't complain about the price. But I have never bought a game (OK I might have once at some point) that wasn't at least 66% off, so don't ask me about paying retail for it.\n\nFinal verdict, If you are an FPS fan, It's worth a run, on at least normal difficulty. I'm sure If I played this  on easy I could go all Rambo on it and mulch the game in a couple or three hours.\n\nI miss the freedom of Dishonoured. Guess what I'm off to play? (Yes, I have Ghost/No Kills on every level)\n\n\n\n","July 10, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I found that in several parts of the game you didnt even need to shoot the game would just “choo choo” tug along in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cliche’d story. And at no point did the game make me adapt or did it change in any way i literally just sat behind cover headshotting any dumbass who popped out of cover with my LITERALLY INFINITE AMMO. and when i wasnt doing that is was using or on some incredibly powerful weapon laying waste to anything that had so much as a pulse and wasnt white. It was kind of unsettling it all felt like some creepy power trip some criminally insane person would have before committing a mass murder. AND THERE WAS LITERALLY LIKE 8? WEAPONS IN THE STORY MODE?? AND YOUR STARTING GEAR WAS PRETTY MUCH ALL THE SAME WEAPON? AN AUTOMATIC WITH AN ACOG. oh maybe your offhand is a shotgun or something at time but the ♥♥♥♥in M4 or whatever that tacticool SEAL guy was using were pretty much the same gun. AND THE STORY IS LIKE EXACLTY LIKE MW2 (SPOILER) MAIN CHARACTER DIES AS YOU PLAY AS STATIC MAIN CHARACTER 2. i was shocked as i finished the game, DUMBFOUNDED as the credits began to roll. IT ROMANTICIZED WAR AND THE MILITARY LIFE SO MUCH. SURE ITS NOT A BAD THING BUT WAR IS ♥♥♥♥ING WAR OK THERES NOTHING PRETTY ABOUT IT. i honestly think this game is ♥♥♥♥ing dangerous. not like how the ♥♥♥♥ing media paints GTAIV to teach kids to kill but this game says WAR IS FUN, YOULL MAKE GOOD FRIENDS, AND EVERYONE WILL RESPECT YOU, KILL BROWN PEOPLE. This game felt like a ♥♥♥♥ing social experiment and i paid way too much for it (Humble Bundle $1)","May 28, 2014","false","5.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Call of Duty may be rehashed garbage but at least its campaigns are entertaining enough to keep me engaged to the end. I could not say the same with the first hour or so of this awful game. Also, why the heck does this not use Frostbite for single player? That would have kept me interested a little longer. Btw, I heard that the campaign was even worse in the Warfighter sequel that proved embarrassing for EA.\n\nThe multiplayer mode uses a limited-destruction version of Frostbite (WTF, DICE?). It's a horrible console port with boring maps, few vehicles, and no mod tools for the community to make their own maps (as is the trend these days, sadly).\n\nOn the technical side, the graphics are nothing to be impressed about. Optimization is passable, but won't make up for the very unimpressive gameplay.\n\nPlease do not buy this game. If you want a brainless single player shooter from a greedy publisher, then play Modern Warfare 2 or 3. If you want an atrocious multiplayer experience, go download the blandest, worst-rated user-created maps from Counter-Strike community websites.\n\nP.S.

The mechanics are servicable. The graphics are generic. What little you can glean from the characters are that they are murderous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The story is a Tea Partier's wankfest.  I guess that's normal for this type of game.\n\nThere is one interesting setpiece; it's a fighter jet graveyard.  You're only there for a few minutes though, and there are fighter jet graveyards in most modern military shooters anyway.\n\nThere is exactly one part of the game that's fun: Your orders are to kill everyone with a heavy machine gun in a seemingly abandoned village. You get to a hut, break in, and then play Defend The Hut for ten minutes.  It was fun because over the course of the mission, RPGs kept taking out the walls until there was almost no cover and I had only 14 bullets left at the end.\n\nFinished the campaign in two nights, probably could have done it in one if I had started an hour earlier.\n\nIf you're looking for a military shooter, how about Spec Ops: The Line instead?

The game is 3 years old when I got it via the Humble Bundle. I was SOOO wrong. In fact I will rate this game as the perfect example of how a company can screw up when they release a single player game on steam.\n\nIt starts out even before you get to play.\nFirst you need to sign in to an EA-account to play... and then you need to enter the serial code for the game.\nEntering the serial is a pain in the unmentionable because the game only lets you type, no cut'n'paste from the clipboard. AND to view the code you need to ALT-TAB between the game and Steam.\n\nSo what do you get for doing this? Nothing. It's not like the game saves your progress online or anything. The only reason for doing this is that EA now ties the game to your EA account as a form of DRM. This means that you can't sell the game to someone else.\n\nSell it? Wait? That was already impossible in the first place, since this is a Steam, right?\nYes, all the pain you just went through to find your EA account details, enter the key was for nothing.\n\nIt does not end here though.\n\nIn case you want to reformat your pc or delete the game, you must remember to deauthorize the game. If you don't you'll some day end up having spent all "your installations" and the game will simply sit in your Steam library as a game you can install, but never get to play.\nThis is again EA's stupid extra DRM. They should have removed this for the Steam version but probably didn't bother because it would cost them a few hours of programmer wages.\n\n\nThen finally you get to the game.\nI remember back in 2010 when I didn't buy the game. There was something fishy about it. The SP was being developed by another team on another platform... Surely this was being done because "every game needs a single player campaign" and the result clearly shows. You don't need to play for more than a few minutes to realize that this game was made to make a quick buck, not to become the best game ever... or anything.\n\n\nThe first impression is... hmmm...were graphics that bad back in 2010?\nOverall things look fine, but you'll find: repeated textures, flat looking tekstures mashed in between fine bumpmapped textured... and every single hut in the game looks exactly the same. If it wasn't for the high detail in textures this game could belong in 2003.\n\nLevel design is extremely bad, even for it's time:\nBlind pathways that block you off with invisible walls are all over.\nSome objects "have physics" while the same looking object, just next to it, does not.\nThe entire map is clearly small, but twisted paths are supposed to make you feel like the area is huge. This joke is obvious in one of the first levels where you ride a quad bike. The quad is there because you have to go far, and the tutorial text tells you that you can powerslide and everything. But there is nothing to do at all. The "fun freeroaming desert ride" that this is supposed to look like, is just as much fun as a kiddie train going in circles. You can't drive off the road, and there is no reason what so ever to use the powerslide. You simply drive behind some other dude who is magically driving just as fast as you all the time.\n\nI have difficulty in comparing this to any other game or time. MoH is simply the prime example of a shooter on rails. I have never seen a game with such a little possibility of choice.(And I've played FPS's since they showed up the mid 90'es. )\n\nBugs and design errors:\nYou don't need to play for more than a few minutes to realize that this game was never properly tested.\nThe game was properly designed to give sort of "the real soldier expericence". And it sort of does that. The HUD is not really doing anything, and you need to listen to what your teammates say. They tend to talk a lot of army lingo and between all this you can somehow figure out what to do. If you miss any of it you're in big trouble.\n\nSome times the HUD will help you, but at other times you will spend some time jumping around the completely empty enemy base, back to your teammates etc. just to find that magic spot that will spawn the next bit of script and bring life to the base.\n\nYour mates do not help. It's not like you can go to them and they will tell you what to do, again. They will just stand completely still in a catatonic state, and wait for you to do the right thing. For me this usually meant ending their miserable lives and in this way restarting the mission at the last checkpoint due to friendly fire.\n\nConclusion:\nI can see why some people might like the game. There is some sort of dark theme over it, that probably makes is more real than many other shooters... however it's simply so badly executed that it's impossible to play the game without becoming mad at it. I've played it for 3 hours, and this is the first game ever that I'm going to CHOSE not to play to the end, simply because it's not worth it.\n","November 28, 2013","false","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I am not a fan of these at all. However, that doesn't mean that I'm not willing to be enlightened by one. Like, maybe this one was going to be good?\n\nHowever, it's Medal of Honor:\n\nIt has absolutely nothing new to add to the bland, tired genre of games it belongs to, besides the emotional story the blandness hides behind.\n\nCool. It's story is a little deep, and a little "Go America"-y, a trait that I find charming.\nBut that's where the compliments stop.\n\nI don't have to explain how this game works, because you already know. Point your retical at dudes and click a button. Follow little icons using your WASD keys, repeat ad nauseum until you win.\n\nAnd you know, I really thought that was a stereotype of the genre. No, really. It's reasonable for me to think that just because Call of Duty did it, it doesn't mean that Medal of Honor won't try to throw somethnig new at me.\n\nThis game reminded me, "oh yeah. Every modern-styled FPS is trying to BE Call of Duty."\n\nAll of it is redundant or boring, almost completely lacking any human input.\n\nAnd it's easy.\n\nInsultingly easy.\n\nEven with starting on the hardest difficulty, this game is a Sunday morning skip through my front yard. I was literally sliding through doors, where upon my quick halt, I'd shoot one dumbfounded AI soldier in the face, and I stab a horrified terrorist on my right, busy reading something like Ulysses, translating from latin to balochi, taking his sweet time to respond to the death of his buddy.\n\nOther times, the terrorists would just shoot at me while my avatar, invulnerable, stands out in the open, taking it all, alive as some very coordinated zombie.\n\nAnd then other times, I just slowly walk towards my foes while they just stand and stare. Eventually, they start shooting. I realize I have an empty gauge, so I decided to reload my gun, being pumped in the heart with hundreds of dollars worth of bullets. I shoot. I kill the dude, still with half of my health left, which is instantly refilled, let's see, one second later.\n\nI have only died about 5 times.\n\nOn hard mode.\n\nThat just speaks for itself.\n\nMy PC is very nice. It can definitley handle games with this much graphical calibur and then some, but it's so horribly ported from consoles, textures are constantly popping in and out. Tall grass looks like it's been taken straight out of Doom, facing the same direction no matter where you stand.\n\nSo no. I recommend that you don't buy Medal of Honor.\n\nUnless you're a masochist, in which, yes, you should buy this.","September 29, 2013","false","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The modern setting I liked, the graphics were also pretty good. What I didn't like were some of the bugs. It's been a while since I played it, but the only thing I CAN remember (yes, short memory... I already forgot what I just typed) were the NPC's that stopped doing anything mid-game which resulted in replaying the entire level all over again. The story was ok, nothing special. It lacked a lot of suspense and action (which is, of course, realistic, but I'm not playing games for 100% realism). Nothing noteworthy.\n\nMultiplayer: Not bad, but the fact that there is (was ?) so much spawnkilling killed this game very quickly for me. Is it that hard to create a solid spawn system (Modern Warfare 2 could do it) ?\n\nIf you don't like MW this might be for you. Otherwise, stick with MW (more action, faster gameplay, better controls, more polished and EXCELLENT multiplayer).\n\n[Rating: 66/100]","July 6, 2011","true","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The single player campaign is short, but it takes players through a series of fun and exciting missions, based on real world events during the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, specifically Operation Anaconda.\n\nI was impressed with the authenticity that went into the game. Alot of the terminology is something that military folks might only understand. The weapons were done well, and there is a good assortment of hardware for players to get their hands on.\n\nOverall, I think Danger Close did a great job with the SP portion but I wish they would've also done the MP portion. DICE (Battlefield), for some reason, was contracted to develop the MP portion. In my opinion, the MP is just stale and too much like Battlefield. Many of the features that are available in SP are not available in MP.\n\nWeapons and damage model in MP are also horrible. Hit detection, is most notably, the worst I've seen in any game. Would not recommend MP.","December 18, 2013","true","14.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/47790/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nMedal of Honor (2010) not to be confused with Medal of Honor (1999) on the PlayStation. Medal of Honor was released on 2010 by EA (Electronic Arts). Medal of Honor takes place in Afghanistan, and was actually developed under the inspiration of American Special Forces.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: The Medal of Honor storyline will have you bouncing back and forth between four different characters, all the while trying to keep up with the unfolding conflict between the USA and with a group similar to the Taliban.\nThe game starts with you playing as a character from a Navy SEAL named “Rabbit”. You will also play once as an Apache gunner, then you alternate between a Delta Force Sniper and and Army Ranger, and finally ending the game from Rabbits perspective.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=525418863\n\nLet me say, this story is just a mess. Within the first twenty minutes of the game, you start switching between characters. There are games that can successfully switch playable characters and you comprehend the story being told, but none of the characters are memorable to drive this method. Honestly, the only two teams I remember participating on were the Navy SEAL's and the Delta Force Sniper group. Everyone else is a blur of “and then we did that”.\n\nWhile the story was interesting, and at times upsetting, (as it can be, when an outsider in a comfortable desk is giving orders which make no sense to the boots on the ground...) the story narrative is hard to follow because of all the character switching, making the story completely tangled and forgettable. Which is sad, as it could have been fantastic.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=525418883\n\nGameplay: The controls are pretty basic as far as most FPS's go. You can alternate between a Primary weapon, a secondary, and a pistol. You also have a melee attack for close fighting, and grenades.\nDepending on whom you're playing as, you have different weapons. For example the seals used a M16-modded rifle, and secondary was a sniper. While in contrast the Delta Sniper group all had silencer modifications on pistols and snipers.\nWhile fighting you can swap out, or pick up weapons... ...but again, that's a footnote and just an expected feature in FPS's.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=525418900\n\nAchievements: There are no Steam Achievements within Medal of Honor. However, in multiplayer there are “Awards” and unlockables as you level up and obtain “skill”.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=528129615\n\nPrice: Medal of Honor is priced at $19.99, I came by my copy from a Humble bundle years ago. The story mode (or “Campaign”) will last about 4 hours, probably less depending on the difficulty you play at and how hard you push forward.\nThere is mutliplayer, but I'll add a section to my review to discuss multiplayer features more in depth. Unless you play multiplayer, $19.99 is far too high a price.\n\nMultiplayer: I logged on several times to see how the community was doing, and naturally there are a few people still playing the game. But there was only one game going actively, the rest were empty.\nThe Multiplayer is what you would expect: you run around, help capture objectives, fill enemies with bullets, get murdered by the guy who's played nonstop since release... 'ya know, the “norms”.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=528129217\n\nAs you complete multiplayer games, you get experience errr excuse me “skill” points (which acts the same way as experience points in other games), you rank up the classes you've been playing, which unlocks bonuses for that class.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=528129359\n\nHistory: I can't complete this review without saying that I admire the Medal of Honor series. The first game I played was the original Medal of Honor released by DreamWorks Interactive in 1999 for the PlayStation.\nLooking back, the story from the 1999 version wasn't so great or interesting. However, it's easier to forgive because of the limitations on hardware at that time. It's a bit more difficult to forgive when a game was released in 2010.\nWhile I do admire the series, it is always been 100% biased for the United States Agenda. (at times I feel falls close to “propaganda”) At least the Medal of Honor series treats the soldiers respectfully and honorably. In the end I care about the soldiers, not the power hungry politicians and governments fueling the wars and death.\n\nConclusion: Medal of Honor was a disappointment, and I really hate to say that. The story was short, it has emphasis on online content and leaderboards, the story was terribly presented, the gameplay was mediocre at best. From a big name like “Medal of Honor”, there's a fairly long and impressive heritage, making this game's failures all that much more disappointing.\nDid the game work? Yeah. Is there still some Multiplayer? Yeah. Can you play and shoot up people? Yeah. What sets this game apart? Nothing. You can take it or leave it. For 20 dollars get a game that actually has a story. If you want online competitive play, go grab a game like Call of Duty, Counter Strike, Team Fortress, there are many choices of FPS which still has a community.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527199532\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update October 03, 2015:\nA very hardy thankyou to Angfucious for spell checking and grammar correcting this piece before I posted it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/C-23/recommended/47790/","C-23","C-23","http://steamcommunity.com/id/C-23/","547 products in account","Medal of Honor is a bland, shallow and uninspired first person shooter very clearly developed and marketed to cash in on the success that the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series was seeing at the time, and in that regard it falls flat on its face.\n\nLets start with the positives. The graphics are pretty good for 2010 and the scene when you're fighting your way up a mountain while an AC-130 gunship fires on targets in the valley below was pretty cool.\n\nNow that that's out of the way.\n\nMoH is a short, boring corridor shooter occasionally broken up by boring turret sections. Your whole squad are walking ammo boxes that you can request ammo from whenever you get low, so ammo conservation and battlefield scavenging do not exist. The shooting is bland and the guns feel weak. There is hardly any weapon variety and almost no enemy variety.\n\nFriendly and enemy AI is generally bad. Enemies stand in the middle of open ground during firefights facing the wrong direction. Almost every time I saw a friendly AI throw a grenade it hit whatever he was using as cover, even during a scripted sequence when one of your squad members uses a grenade to clear a cave entrance. This got me killed more than once. Friendlies will CONSTANTLY run into your fire, blocking enemies and complaining about friendly fire, although as far as I could tell, you can't actually harm them.\n\nOn multiple occasions scripted sequences would break and require me to load the previous checkpoint. The checkpoints were badly placed and dying would often result in having to replay long portions of the mission and watch unskippable scripted sequences all over again.\n\nAll of the characters are the same generic, bearded tier 1 operator that contemporary shooters are known for. By the end of the game I didn't know anything about any of the characters or their personalities, which wouldn't be so bad if the game weren't constantly trying to make you feel comradery with your squad and to empathise with their struggle.\n\nThere are a very limited number of graphics options and the FOV is so low that I had to sit a few metres away from my screen in order to not feel nauseous.","April 29","false","6.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","3"

Reality FTW!\n\n- Dialogue is tedious.\n\n- Game tries to copy over the top action from CoD but it fails miserably.\n\n- You need to manually enter CD due to copy protection. As if someone would want to pirate this PoS!\n\n- Looks ugly. Feels ugly. Plays ugly. Your character is ugly. Enemies are ugly.\n\n- And once more, is boring. Won't even finish it, it's not worth the time!\n\nPros\n\n- Runs nice on pretty much anything. Coz it's ugly.\n\n- Hmmmm... thinking, thinking...\n\n\nAll in all, avoid like a plague. It's not the worst game out there, for sure, but this was supposed to be AAA title, and as such is a failure.

It was also so annoyingly "corridory" which I normally don't mind, if it's done properly. But in Medal of Honor, you have invisible walls in front of you and you wonder, why in the world you can't simply walk or jump over this small rock. You are also treated like little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (where you are supposed to create bond with other soldiers I assume) when your mates can climb over a wall perfecly fine but you need their hand.\n\nGraphics are really nice and SMOOTH. That's good achievement.\n\nI can't say anything about multiplayer since I never played it.\n\nI can't believe they actually ask 30 bucks for this. Don't buy this unless it's 5 bucks! I'm serious.

It is repetitive, there is no story, gameplay is extremely basic and no feeling of progression as you go through the extremely short (5 hours in my case) game.\n\nThe game is set entirely in Afghan tundra, with the exception of one urban level and another one set in an airbase and although  tundra is not a common environment in videogames, it is extremely overused here. Gameplay consists of simple first-person shooter action broken up by vechile sections. There was nothing in that respect that I haven't seen before.\n\nThe story was so extremely uninteresting that I forgot it in it's entirety inbetween playing it and writing this review and although that was some time, I can say with certainity that there was no thing going on for the entire duration of the game. I was simply doing stuff without any form of greater context, so my memory of it all is now a miasma of brown deserts with equally brown-uniformed men trodding around while firing the same boring guns at other brown men. The only thing I remembered was one nice moment where you were given the impression that you would be overwhelmed by the enemy in a lengthy standoff, but the opportunity for the game to do something interesting is wasted when you are saved by a helicopter at the last moment. But without doubt the worst moment in the entire story aspect is when I didn't realise the game was over untill the end credits appeared. I seriously was just playing a mission as difficult or interesting as all the other ones untill all of a sudden a cutscene came up where I found some guy dead who I had to rescue since the moment the game had reached 50% of it's runtime. Then the game just stopped. In other words, a story thread that only spanned part of the game was resolved and for some reason the game took the moment to run off in it's entirety. Nothing I did in the first half of the game changed anything meaningful about the rest of the game.\n\nThen I tried the multiplayer. Although I have to admit that my brief experience was satisfying, that was mostly because of that I found that I was better at it than most playing. That is not a weird thing, considering that all you do in the multiplayer is run around and shoot eachother in microscopic environments. Therefore noone who plays first person shooters regularly is still playing that, which explains my experience. After 20 minutes I was done, I quit and never returned.\n\nIf you ask me, this game is just boring. I would not recommend that you pay money for it at all to play it.","June 13, 2014","false","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That depends on what you are looking for and how you define it. Its about Afghanistan and thats a touchy subject.\n\nI don't think that Danger Close was trying to make light of the war in Afghanistan. I also think a distinction needs to be made between a war game/movie, and an action game/movie. War movies should not be fun, they should be dramatic, even painful, as a way to pay respect to the gravity of the situation/people invoved. Whereas action movies/games can be fun, because they generally focus around a caricatured protagonist who is the embodiment of some particular virtue.\n\nThis distinction would be what separates Spec Ops: The Line from Call of Duty Modern Warfare 1-3.\n\nIf this game is a war game then yes. If this game is an action game then no. But that distinction can really only be made in the mind of the player.","May 18, 2014","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I always thought it was just another top-notch military shooter with a stupid villain and a world consuming problem (COD, Battlefield 3). It's a military shooter yea, but the game doesn't serve you a stupid story with completely forgettablte characters. In Medal of Honor you embark on intense missions against the Talibans over the course of 3 days. You play as several characters instead of only one. Missions after missions the pace is kept to a comfortable level ranging from stealthy missions to intentse all-out warfare missions. That means that there will be enough diversity over the course of the game to keep you entertained on every mission.\nWhile the game could be longer (single-player is quite short), there is still quality to get. The characters, while not the best ones either, are memorable enough so that you'll actually recognise them throughout the different missions. The story itself is mostly military-missions showing the grittyness and hostility of the location soldiers are sent to these days.\n\nCombat itself is pretty straightforward. There is nothing revolutionary, which means that you if you've played Battlefield or any other shooter, you have also played the mechanics of this game. However, those mechanics definetely still work, and it is the different range of missions, locations and intensity that will keep you entertained throughout the game.\n\nThe music of this game is beautifully composed bu Ramin Djawadi (Game of Thrones). The music really helps the story to be told throughout the game. The graphics are also nice to look at. The locations you play in all have their unique colours and feeling.\n\nOverall I do really recommend this game. It serves a more realistic approach (while probably still a little over-the-top) to the shooter-games, and it kept me entertained throughout the whole story.","June 8, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Still, there is some fun to be had; the sliding and stabbing mechanics can make you feel pretty bad**s and headshots reward you with a satisfying splat. The shooting mechanics are fine and the graphics are pretty good (some scenes of the mountains are actually breathtaking) but that's where the good ends really.The campaign is kind of cool because it feels a bit like you're playing the movie "Lone Survivor" but it's far too short - like mayyybbe five hours. The characters and story are bland and I couldn't make myself care about any of it which is unfortunate given that this game is supposed to represent a real, ongoing conflict that involves many real people. The AI is terrible and each gunfight devolves into waiting for each individual head to pop out from behind cover. The game is glitchy and has little direction as to which rock you have to hide behind to activate the next scripted event. At one point, I got into a death loop beacause I was killed by a truck rolling into my cover and blowing up only to be spawned directly in front of that very same truck just before it exploded again. I almost exited the game right then but I eventually got out of the loop and found that if you manage to get yourself back to where the enemies spawn, they will completely ignore you because you are not where the game expects you to be. It's stuff like this that really ruins what could have been a cool concept for the Medal of Honor reboot. I got this game in a humble bundle so I'm not too worried about value, but I can't really recommend this game unless you can grab it for $5 or less.","June 20, 2014","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then the only reason I continued playing it was just because I could laugh at it.  And then I realized that trying to laugh at it was just making me slowly die inside.  So having finally uninstalled it, here are some of the main things that I find completely ridiculous in this game:\n\nApparently your character's arms are made of wet spaghetti noodles, because while your squadmates have no trouble lifting their arms above their head and hauling themselves onto a ledge, you have to get one of them to boost you up by running over and pressing a button.\nThe game shatters all attempts at being taken seriously when it chooses to call these helping hands "buddy boosts".\nThe plot is dull, the voice acting lifeless (and bad in places), and expects you to care about a bunch of guys whose "names" go from the semi-reasonable (Voodoo) to the hilariously ridiculous (Mother).  Ex: Mother: Okay, we have to go do the thing and then the thing and the stuff.  Voodoo: Thanks, Mom.  Me: YOU ACTUALLY WANT ME TO THINK THIS IS ALL GRITTY AND SERIOUS?!?!\nThe game restricts you at every turn.  There was a point where I tried to enter a house with a wide open door.  I could see inside!  And yet the doorway was just an invisible wall.  Note that this is not always the case, but still...If you can't enter somewhere, just close the door!  On another occasion, I was walking along a cliff and decided to try and jump off - you know, for science.  NOPE.  Invisible wall.  No fence or wall that would be a reasonable blockade - nothing that justified me not being able to do this.  Just the developers saying, "We don't want you to go over there, but we're too lazy to actually show you that."\nBUDDY BOOSTS.\nAt one point, your character gets blood splattered on his face, and the camera shows blood splats.  Keep in mind that your character is not wearing goggles, thereby implying he has blood on his eyes.  Then your squadmate comes over and magically wipes the blood away!  Thanks for molesting my eyeballs, buddy.\nThe pistol is hilariously overpowered.  I went through entire sections of the game just going crazy with it.  It has enough range that you can snipe people from decently far away, it shoots quite fast, and it has infinite ammo (unlike your other weapons).\nFREAKING BUDDY BOOSTS.\nWhen the game does give you a bit of freedom, it's ridiculous how quickly it can fall apart.  There was a part where I ran ahead of my squad, shot everyone in the area while my team was monologuing, and then ran to the back of the area while the next scene triggered.  After an air strike came through, I pulled out a grenade and counted it off.  After a couple of seconds, I hurled it into a seemingly empty alcove, where a moment later, about five enemy fighters spawned and were immediately blown up.\nYour squadmates can and often will play the game for you.  There were times were I ran into an area, fired off some shots to get the enemy's attention, and then crouched behind a wall while my squad took out everyone.  Word of advice, devs: Making the player feel completely irrelevant to a game's outcome does not make them want to keep playing.\nTHEY ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO CALL THEM BUDDY BOOSTS WHO THE HELL WAS IN CHARGE OF THAT?!?!?!?!\nIn addition, the plot is dull, the graphics aren't anything special (hooray...gray...), the sound is unremarkable (my friend commented that a hail of gunfire just sounded like hail), and the gameplay is, in many cases, entirely optional.  Just...go play a shooter that actually seems to care about the player.\n\nTLDR: THIS GAME SUCKS BECAUSE BUDDY BOOSTS.","March 11, 2015","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The level design is rather convuluted, and I often found myself trying to figure out where to go.  I guess this shouldn't have been as much of a problem as a lot of the level progression is explained to you by your squad mates.  Unfortunately, for the majority of the game, the entirety of the Dialog was both imperceptable and unitelligable, leaving me feeling lost and confused.\nOn 3 or 4 occasions, the game got stuck, and failed to load the next mission objective, leaving me confused and frustrated for a few minutes until I figured out what was going on, and re-loaded the game save.\nUnfortunately, not even the story was able to redeem this game in my eyes.  Unlike most linear first person shooters, Medal of Honor doesn't try to tell some kind of story with a villan and a hero via dialog and cut scenes, but rather it attempts to give the player a "slice of life experience".  This is all well and good, however it was not executed well.  As most FPS characters are, the subjects of this game are static characters who neither develop as the game goes on, or are given a chance to really set themselves apart as someone for you to care about.

You follow your squadmates through linear environments, and click on taliban to kill them.\n\nIt's a pretty game, but there's just no substance. It tries to stress the importance of keeping each other alive, but your teammates are invincible, friendly fire has no effect, and your fellow soldiers frankly don't give a damn about you outside of scripted sequences. They can have a perfect shot directly behind someone who is blasting AK rounds at you, and they will often not bother taking it. To be honest, they're more or less entirely useless outside of cutscenes and scripted sequences, only serving as voices telling you what and what not to do, or time wasters you need to wait for before you can progress into the next area. Seldom does the game even allow you to move ahead of them - one of the few times it allowed me to, doing so triggered a glitch that prevented the game from progressing until I reset to the last checkpoint.\n\nAbout the only helpful thing your teammates do for you is give you ammo when you stand next to them and press "F", or whatever the action is bound to. They only give you ammo when you're running low, but often what they do give you are hundreds (in one case up to a thousand) of rounds at a time. As long as you're using weapons they have the right sort of ammo for in their pocket munitions factory, you will never run dry. This sort of undercuts the tension when you're supposed to be completely isolated and on your own in hostile territory.\n\nThe game tries to mix things up with sections where you must SOFLAM target something to call in airstrikes, or operate a helicopter's guns/missiles yourself, but really the only thing that changes in those is loss of independent movement and embiggening of the special effects upon successfully pointing and clicking on a "bad guy". There are also stationary sniper sequences that are more "Where's Waldo?" then the standard shooting range stroll.\n\nEverything is unrelentingly guided. This is evident from the very first scene, in which you're in the passenger seat of a car that you can't get out of, and the game doesn't even trust you enough to give you camera control. It wants to suck you in to an epic story of badass sacrifice in the line of duty, and it wants everything to happen just so. The problem is that it all rings hollow, and by the time the game pleads with you to feel some emotion over the death of an american soldier (wrenching camera control from your grasp again, naturally), you've already mowed down hundreds of other people without consequence.\n\nAny interest (emotional, intellectual, even visceral eventually) they were trying to instill in the game is just completely undercut by how rote the whole experience is. Its a shame that such beautiful visual design, with sometimes surprising variation and attention to detail is wasted on an experience that allows for no sense of agency, and plays one note over and over beneath all those new coats of paint.\n\nIn any case, while the game overstayed its welcome fairly rapidly for me, it IS only around four hours long.\nFollow orders and you'll get through this, all right?

I always thought it was just another top-notch military shooter with a stupid villain and a world consuming problem (COD, Battlefield 3). It's a military shooter yea, but the game doesn't serve you a stupid story with completely forgettablte characters. In Medal of Honor you embark on intense missions against the Talibans over the course of 3 days. You play as several characters instead of only one. Missions after missions the pace is kept to a comfortable level ranging from stealthy missions to intentse all-out warfare missions. That means that there will be enough diversity over the course of the game to keep you entertained on every mission.\nWhile the game could be longer (single-player is quite short), there is still quality to get. The characters, while not the best ones either, are memorable enough so that you'll actually recognise them throughout the different missions. The story itself is mostly military-missions showing the grittyness and hostility of the location soldiers are sent to these days.\n\nCombat itself is pretty straightforward. There is nothing revolutionary, which means that you if you've played Battlefield or any other shooter, you have also played the mechanics of this game. However, those mechanics definetely still work, and it is the different range of missions, locations and intensity that will keep you entertained throughout the game.\n\nThe music of this game is beautifully composed bu Ramin Djawadi (Game of Thrones). The music really helps the story to be told throughout the game. The graphics are also nice to look at. The locations you play in all have their unique colours and feeling.\n\nOverall I do really recommend this game. It serves a more realistic approach (while probably still a little over-the-top) to the shooter-games, and it kept me entertained throughout the whole story.","June 8, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Still, there is some fun to be had; the sliding and stabbing mechanics can make you feel pretty bad**s and headshots reward you with a satisfying splat. The shooting mechanics are fine and the graphics are pretty good (some scenes of the mountains are actually breathtaking) but that's where the good ends really.The campaign is kind of cool because it feels a bit like you're playing the movie "Lone Survivor" but it's far too short - like mayyybbe five hours. The characters and story are bland and I couldn't make myself care about any of it which is unfortunate given that this game is supposed to represent a real, ongoing conflict that involves many real people. The AI is terrible and each gunfight devolves into waiting for each individual head to pop out from behind cover. The game is glitchy and has little direction as to which rock you have to hide behind to activate the next scripted event. At one point, I got into a death loop beacause I was killed by a truck rolling into my cover and blowing up only to be spawned directly in front of that very same truck just before it exploded again. I almost exited the game right then but I eventually got out of the loop and found that if you manage to get yourself back to where the enemies spawn, they will completely ignore you because you are not where the game expects you to be. It's stuff like this that really ruins what could have been a cool concept for the Medal of Honor reboot. I got this game in a humble bundle so I'm not too worried about value, but I can't really recommend this game unless you can grab it for $5 or less.","June 20, 2014","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ppnhzk/recommended/47790/","ppnhzk","ragequitmaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ppnhzk/","1364 products in account","Medal of Honor can be compared mostly to the recent episodes of the Call of Duty franchise. You get a military shooter with very linear and short campaign and a multiplayer mode which was designed for the masses. In both parts MoH fails to compete against the successful series. However, there are some parts which are more valuable than in the case of the other. I played through the game twice, so it can be considered as one of my favorite military shooters to date.\n\nI would start with the graphics and overall design. Unlike Warfighter, MoH uses the Unreal Engine which is a good choice for any shooters. The utilization however is not the best. The game has the usual "previous generation console issues" like blurry textures, worthless anti-aliasing and optimization problems. Also I need to mention that the level design is pretty varied. The night scenes mostly look good with all the lightning, but sometimes I encounter areas which are so poorly detailed. There are almost completely empty rooms, small flames coming from nowhere and a other annoying things. It is maybe not fair to judge a game's graphics four years after release, but I was not amazed at the time when it came out. In 2010 I have seen much better visuals already and the cut-scenes in the game are so disappointing, they are just ruining the atmosphere.\n\nOne of the better parts of the game is the gameplay. The gunplay is fun, however the behaviour of the weapons sometimes clumsy and weird. Overall it is still acceptable. There are multiple weapons to use from both sides during missions. The short campaign includes the usual sections, like sneaking, sniping, shooting with mg, etc. There are some good ideas either, which seems pretty experimental and brave at times. Some of the areas are nicely done, allowing some freedom and variation, though most of them are pretty linear and strict. At one point on day 2 we crossed under a bridge while troops were marching above us. The game gave me the control, but I was told to let them pass. Once I tried to shoot the separated soldier, all the others started to shoot. Actually, after a few shots they fled, and my partner just desperately wanted to climb the bank of the river bed and chase them. So, sometimes you got more freedom, but in these cases you would never know what happens if you do not stick to the plan, you can even fail the mission because of a bug. And, if I speak about bugs, I encountered a few during my gameplay. Sometimes these breaks the game, like when one of your teammate stuck into a wall, so you need to reload a previous checkpoint. Fortunately, the game saves pretty often, so you do not lose much progress if something bad happens. These linear sequences sometimes nicely choreographed, so I do not complain about it all the time.\n\nI have mixed opinions about the writing and storytelling too. You have to control various soldiers during the campaign. These are from different classes, allowing you to explore the full arsenal of the division. However, this may prevent the connection to one certain soldier, making characters less memorable. As I mentioned before, the cutscenes are not managed to give me a good impression, but some of them are exceptions. I really liked the ending. The tense was pretty high in those last minutes, which elevated the game quite a bit. It was really sad and touching. The whole storytelling tries a different approach to the genre and sometimes it is what moves the player forward. I recently watched the Lone Survivor movie and I had similar feeling during the playtime. The game gives back the feel of the war zone in the middle east well.\n\nNow comes my favourite part of the game, the audio part. Ramin Djawadi wrote an amazing soundtrack for this title, which earns the game a playthrough on its own. I played the game with lowered effects volume, so that the music can be more enjoyable. The album is also one of my favourite military soundtrack album. The sounds are also pretty much in place. You do not hear anything awkward. The weapon sounds are good, the impacts makes you feel the pressure during combat. The overall feedback is great. Last part in the audio section is the dialogues. This is a shooter, so the most frequent lines you will hear are orders for movement, shoot and others. The lines during cut-scenes and between fights are mostly passable. They do not worsen the experience.\n\nOverall, this game feels like an early release. It would needed more polish and work on details. I do not say, that multiplayer could compete against any of the CoD's, but the singleplayer part could be much more enjoyable. That way this could be a must have. However, I still recommend this game, because it is still closer to my heart than many other shooters out there.\n\nMy Opinion:\nOVERALL: 7.5/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nSound: 9/10\nReplay Value: 7/10\n\nPS: I did not play the multiplayer, as it was not populated too much at the time of my first playthrough, neither it is now.","August 21, 2014","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The plot attempts fails to draw emotions while simultaneously keeping you from caring about anything in the "story". Medal of Honor offers nothing that hadn't been seen before; it consists of mindless killing without anything to care about. It's a game that doesn't make you think.

Rabbit?\n\nThis Medal of Honor game reeks of Call of Duty influence, except sadly the gameplay isn't as fluid as Call of Duty's and the campaign isn't as interesting either. Down to the stupid player character names (Rabbit = Soap anyone?), it's clear EA tried to revive a classic series and bring it back to life to compete with the big boys. Unfortunately, they failed and we're left with a generic FPS game set in the brown 'n' bloom desert. With an unengaging plot which tries too hard with it's cutscenes, there's little to push you to press forward in the campaign.\n\nEnemy AI is garbage too, leading to mostly dull fights in the streets, rooftops and warehouses of Afghanistan. The guns look nice, and feel good to shoot. They even sound nice. It's just a shame they're stuck in this game. Graphics can be appealing at times but mostly the dull uninspired enviroments leave a lot to be desired, and the lack of graphics options in the main menu was a let down as I had no way to reduce the jaggies which soured my experience a little.\n\nIn conclusion, EA tried to create a Call of Duty killer yet only managed to spawn a generic, drab, uninspired FPS set in the desert which spells boring enviroments -a-palooza and tries to pull you in with a cliché and boring story. Avoid.","August 24, 2014","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels authentic and more in depth than Battlefield in terms of giving you as much taste of the real battlefield as a game can, it's story is phenomenal. From a military standpoint, this isn't no Call of Duty "shoot em up", this is a legitimate "simulator" in terms of the horrors and stress soldiers go through on the field, I presume this is why it and it's less intense counterpart Battlefield get lower ratings from the standard FPS gamer. The only negatives I can find on this game is a little short for the campaign, and graphics load issues.\n\nIf you want authentic, get this, if you want teamwork, get Battlefield. If you want a cheap time waster, with no sense of story or teamwork, stick with Call of Duty.\n\n7/10 Overall.

It has pretty grafix and it runs decently. It's worth picking it up on a sale to experience the mediocre but enjoyable story. This is the perfect Call of Duty clone. It wants to be Modern Warfare so bad it's not even funny. Down to the smallest detail. If I have one complaint about the Singleplayer is that it's sensitivity option is PURE ♥♥♥♥♥! It doesn't go low enough. I've lowered the DPI on my mouse and it still goes WAY faster than I would like to. It's such a basic option, yet they didn't fiddle enough with it so it makes the game kinda unplayable for me, I had to pull every trick in the hat, lower Windows sensitivity and so on so forth, to make it playable. Every game's sensitivity option should go from 0 to 100. 0 being DEAD STOP, not moving at all, 100 being crazy fast. Not this game. This game is special.... This is even more curios because the MULTIPLAYER's sensitivity option is very good. It does what it's supposed to do, it goes as low as you want it to, until it stops moving completely. Weird. So this nice segway brings us to multiplayer. If you're buying it for the MP, DON'T. Get the latest COD, it'll be the same. At the time of writing there are only about 100 players playing the MP at any given time! Only a couple of the 4-5 MP modes are played, and those are not the best kind of modes. Not to mention that those 100 players, given their dedication, are MAX level and have every little ♥♥♥♥ unlocked, so they're like 5 times more powerful than you, due to the better upgrades they have. If you want a compelling MP experience similar to this go play COD, or try your luck with Medal Of Honor Warfighter, but even with Warfighter I don't think the MP community is what it was at launch, not that this game even EVER had a decent MP community, not even at launch. So bottom line is, buy this game at a sale to experience the decent Singleplayer campaign. That is all.","August 23, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall, it's a good game for the price. I got it on Humble Bundle, but it's easily worth 20 dollars. No more though. ( assuming it comes with multiplayer)\nThe multiplayer is the same as COD or CSGO; filled with hackers and (wanna-be) trolls. It's fine, but I much prefer the campaign mode.

While it starts off strong and is less over the top and more realistic than Call of Duty, it also feels tone deaf and starts to meander toward the end, eventually just throwing sheer numbers at you until you explode your way to a confusing and unsatisfying outro. There were more than a few glitches in the scripting that would have me loading past checkpoints because I hit an apparent dead end or endlessly respawning enemies with no chance of progress. On the reset eventually a cinematic event would start that never happened the first or second or time around that would unlock the next part of the map or start a cutscene. There's a stealthy sort of mission halfway through that would not let me get the drop on the bad guys quietly from any approach. The game itself would crash every other time I started it up and a couple of times in-game. I didn't touch the "Tier 1" mode or multiplayer but I'm guessing that's not as fun as CoD, either. (Plus I didn't feel like setting up yet another exclusive game account so EA can track my stats.)","March 29, 2014","false","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't describe it, but it feels like it's exacly what I've been looking for.  A lot of people say that the game sucks for a reason...but I don't think so! In my opinion this game rullz. It's true that at some places it is just too similar to Call Of Duty but to be honest, I prefer MOH than COD. Just because it works better for me.  Everybody has a different taste of gaming. So I think I've found mine. I'm going to finish the SP and have no patience to  write something about the MP.\n\n(Review on MP) This was the most horrible "thing" that i have ever played. The maps are overwroughted.  The buildings are enormous and the players are pocket-size and it's really hard to find somebody. The campers are on every meter so the choise is vacant, but in my opinion it sucked anyway When you die..you just die. You can't even see from where did the bullets came or where is the guy who killed you, The RPG ; Granade Launchers spammers are really annoying.  You can't move to the LEFT or the RIGHT (with A-D) while you sprint. The game needs to be balanced. A new player shouldn't play with ones from higher levels, laughing at his death insted of going on with the game.

While it starts off strong and is less over the top and more realistic than Call of Duty, it also feels tone deaf and starts to meander toward the end, eventually just throwing sheer numbers at you until you explode your way to a confusing and unsatisfying outro. There were more than a few glitches in the scripting that would have me loading past checkpoints because I hit an apparent dead end or endlessly respawning enemies with no chance of progress. On the reset eventually a cinematic event would start that never happened the first or second or time around that would unlock the next part of the map or start a cutscene. There's a stealthy sort of mission halfway through that would not let me get the drop on the bad guys quietly from any approach. The game itself would crash every other time I started it up and a couple of times in-game. I didn't touch the "Tier 1" mode or multiplayer but I'm guessing that's not as fun as CoD, either.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Edatain/recommended/47790/","Edatain","Edatain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Edatain/","541 products in account","The game seems to be trying to show the realism of war, the bleakness- as the colour palette shows. But the game mechanics prevent it from doing this. Lack of health packs means lack of tension, ammo can be gotten from team mates so the fact that you have limited ammo in your weapons is a bit of an illusion. At many points during the game the music will just stop. One example is during a mission as a character you’ve never played before, you and your three (every level is you and 3 invulnerable team-mates) holding off against waves of insurgents. There’s no music to provide realism and tension! Except there is no tension, the enemies come at you from the same paths again and again, I’ve been playing this character for about 20 minutes, why should I care if he lives or dies. MAKE ME CARE GAME. If the game is relying on the fact that it’s based on real-life events to make me care about the characters then it’s sorely mistaken. The game’s mechanics of what is essentially unlimited ammo, team-mates that absorb whole clips of both enemy and friendly fire, incredibly stupid AI, bullet spongy enemies, extreme linearity and oh much more mean that it cannot in all fairness successfully convey real-life situations and make me feel the horrors of war. Either you go the ARMA route where one bullet can kill you, where the realism of warfare is far more apparent than MoH or you go the CoD route of arcade mayhem while conveying emotions through storytelling. Medal of honour is an absolute mess.\nThe game is disjointed, horribly disjointed. The story is only carried by the cinematics which bookend levels, if your players need the cinematics to follow the story/care about what is going on then you’ve failed at FPS storytelling. Every few levels you change character, moving from special forces to simply infantry. That’s fine in and of itself, but I actually became slightly disorientated, if you skip the cinematic it can take a few minutes to work out who you are playing as based on your location and team members. Not that you can give any orders to your team mates, even medal of honour European assault let you do that. They just follow scripted events and bark orders at you. The game has predictable scripted sequences that even Activision would laugh at. You see all the Call of duty references? That’s because it’s so ♥♥♥♥ing clear that MoH is EA’ response to call of duty. Now in 2013 it’s obvious that they’ve focused on Battlefield as their counter to CoD, even though the games are very different (multiplayer wise) single player wise they’re both a boring as one another.  But of course, it’s the multiplayer component that sells both games.\nMedal of Honor lacks colour, which is part of this aim at ‘realism’- though in the sense of feeling not in gameplay. Its so boring and depressing, which sums up MoH. Not depressing because of its focus on real-life events or questioning the legality and morality of what the soldiers are actually fighting for (which would actually make an interesting twist to modern military shooters) but because it shows complete and utter disregard for originality and the medal of honour franchise. The lack of a HUD reiterates part of this  ‘realistic approach’, yet in a game where you cans till take a handful of bullets before dying it seems like a bit of useless attempt at getting across whatever message about war Danger close are trying to convey.\nForget about the series being set in ww2, even if MoH were set in the second world war, itd still be ♥♥♥♥ing boring. The guns feel boring, and the enemies are not interesting in the slightest. They’re just Nazis in middle-eastern garb. By that I mean they have no character outside of them being EVIL. We don’t see anything that makes us question why we are killing hundreds of these guys, it’s like the game just paints the word TERRORIST in great big letters on their heads. That’s all the motivation we need apparently. Maybe that’s a joke at how soldiers have to remove those thoughts from their heads in order to do their job properly. Or it’s just lazy storytelling, you pick.\nGraphically this game looks about 3 years older than it should. 2011 was only a year away which would herald the use of the frostbite 2 engine. Even battlefield bad company 2 looked far superior to Medal of honour and that came out the same bloody year. The only decent textures are on people’s faces, everything else oozes muddy brown pixels. I’d argue that this is due to an attempt at making a console beating CoD killer, but EA must have been utterly delusional to think that. If CoD gets complaints for being stale then MoH is a loaf of bread left behind two biscuit tins for 4 years, dusted off and then put in shiny packaging to sell to people who only want call of duty clones. Not that it can even be called a clone; the changes it does make (aside from the MoH ability to lean around cover) make the game into a boring mess. Oh and the bugs, these mainly revolve around the AI and the ragdoll/physics effects, at least they make me laugh I guess, something in this game has to.\n\nThe studio behind this game have an interesting history, as EA Los Angeles they created the battle for middle earth games, all MoH games from Frontline and created both red alert 3 and the terrible ending to Command & Conquer, tiberian twilight. A history of some great and some terrible games. Rebranded as ‘Danger Close’ the studio made the two modern Medal of Honour games, the last of which has been classed as a franchise killer. Now EA have rebranded the studio yet again as DICE Los Angeles, and set them to work on the extremely anticipated game, Battlefront 3. I really hope danger close rethink their fps game design. Clearly modern military shooters were not a genre the studio was good at, taking tons of tropes and clichés, covering it in cardboard and serving it on a grey plate in a grey room for grey people to sit and eat while they laugh at re-runs of Miranda.\nThat all said, Battlefront 3 is being designed by the DICE team behind Battlefield, so hopefully Danger Close, I mean DICE LA, won’t be able to suck the life out of this one.\n","December 1, 2013","false","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The singleplayer is fun, but has very little replayability as it is really blant. There is nothing special about it, and nothing too bad. The multiplayer is pretty good, but didn't keep me entertained for too long. Overal a game that is very 'Naturel'. I would recommend to either leave it, or buy it in a sale like I did.","January 20, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was expecting more out of this game. This game is completely filled with campers and the weapons are not abundant and maps are very limited and small. And the game overall feels dull and drawn out. The campaign is good, but that's about it. It's not a bad game, but...............nothing impressive to be honest.\n\n(UPDATE AS OF 6/28/2014): At first I was disappointed with this game back in 2012 until one of my friends urged me to play it. After jumping into the game, I realized what a mistake I made by not giving this a chance back in 2012. First off, it's a WAY better game than Bad Company 2, and it's a very solid title. My only issue however are the campers since there's a lot of them.\n\nBut other than that, it's a great game and I totally recommend it.","December 30, 2012","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

I Highly enjoyed the game the characters in the gamae work well and are actualy useful , they will kill enemies give you ammo and point out enemies to you rather than being useless bullet soakers like in other shooters.I also commplement the fact that stealth sections areent forced on you, you can make up for a mistake rather than being condemened to an instant death or loss. The gunplay worked reasonably well and although there is definatly alot to be desired the headshot system is Very satisfying. Finaly I'd like to say that unlike every other fps I have played, (other than halo of course) this ending actualy kind of made me feel sad. I would recommened this although of course it does have it's flaws in the end I found it to be quite the enjoyable campaign, I'd give it a 7/10 as far as its genre is concerned but as a whole a 6/10 is more fitting","June 29, 2014","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
