I hope more developers explore and incorporate the redirected walking concept, because it could be a great alternative to the commonly used teleportation mechanic. I will say that the game is very very very short, but well worth it for $3- I will be showing it to all of my friends.","April 6","true","0.9"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

Fantastic pricing!  If you nearly meet the area requirements like me (about 3.8mX3.8m) , you should give it a go - I didn't seem to have any issues with the game itself (Vive tracking can be annoying though, if you don't have the base stations perfectly set up).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/429830/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","Unseen Diplomacy is kind of a rare game, because it requires one of the largest possible VR room sizes to play. The actual game is only about 8 minutes long by my average, and it's priced accordingly, but it seems to randomize itself each time you play with a few different variables for the room layout. The game is fairly simple and mostly just involves navigating through a few rooms that might have lasers or make you crawl through vents until you reach the end room, so it's fairly simple, but it's made interesting because it's one of the few VR games where you never have to teleport or use a trackpad to move around; you just walk through the whole thing. The only problem is that it doesn't tell you that it randomizes itself, so if you only play it once you might end up in a game that's almost nothing but crawling through vents and get a less interesting experience, but the randomization also seems like it would make it a good game to show a group, since each person can play it in a short time and get a different scene.","April 29","true","0.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

First hand, it's MIND BLOWING. I didn't have enough space but I had to make do with what room I had but if I had the required spacing of 4m it would be off the charts amazing. I suppose it's only $3 because it's relatively short. NOW the big thing that the dev could do that would be FREAKIN awesome is make something like this but like the Halloween horror houses of universal studios or 'Spooktober' where in real life you go from room to room in a haunted "asylum" and in each room you are  confronted with different horrors that make you edge closely to the wall until you can get to the next room. This is my hopes that one day a game like that using Unseen Dip's mechanics, can be made. Back to this game lol, it's straight forward, it's simple and though it's short, it's mind blowing enough to say it's well worth it.

It's brilliant and a lot more engaging for me than any teleport system.\n\nThe game is incredibly short, at a few minutes to complete, but at a few bucks it’s more than worth your attention.\n","May 1","true","0.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The randomized rooms add sigificantly to the replayability of the game but it needs some more variety. I would like to see some progression in the use new tools and mechanics. I like that the game is always pretty short so you can have multiple people try it in a party situation. Since the end of the game features the keyboard you should need to use the keyboard in a previous room beforehand. I wasn't able to figure out what you should do at the end of the game to save the internet, I've bashed the keyboards but now what...Internet deleted. Could have some different endings also, maybe a bomb defusal finale. But the game is pretty inexpensive so it's worth an impulse buy. I am able to play in a 8.5ft x 13.5ft area but I could probably use an extra 1ft or so in either direction. The vive floor calbration issue can be a problem with this game so you may need to recalibrate before playing.","May 1","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It wasn't perfect as I had to crawl into the wall a little to get through one of the tunnels.

Conceptually it is well done and I appreciate the example here.  You must have 3m x 4m play space - or very close to it.  So I redid my basement furniture to increase my play space to the maximum available.  When using every inch of your space - it's pretty easy to lose tracking, so I had trouble doing things like unscrewing the bottom corner screws while I was against a wall.\n\nThere is no real story to it, nothing bigger then working your way through these obstacles.

Each playthrough is short and take about 5-10 minutes to complete but the randomly generated obstacles keep the game fresh each time you play it. The cherry on top for this game is that it's not only fun to play it; it's fun to watch others play it too!\n\nOne warning for people looking to purchase this game is that it does require a large play area (4m x 3m / 12ft x 9ft) and you will be crawling around a lot. Due to that this game is best suited for people with large play areas free of any obstruction. That's not to say you can't play it with a smaller space (I'm able to play with a space of 3.5m x 2m) the issue is that you'll have to cheat a bit to get past certain areas.","May 18","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
