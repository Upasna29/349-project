"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/292670/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account","Princess Isabella - Return of the Curse is the second game of the Princess Isabella series and also its peak probably. Coming out from Gogii games as its predecessor, the game narrates another chapter in the titular princess' life and her lifelong enmity with a witch.\n\nYears after princess' adventure and commotion with the witch, the curse returns to her land. It's been several years now that she's been happily living with her husband, and baby daughter Bella; but dark shadows summoned by the witch infiltrate the castle and abduct Bella. They had an unfinished business after all. Isabella takes on a journey throughout her kingdom this time, facing witch's forces, aiding townsfolk cursed by the said witch and searching for her beloved daughter. Will she prevail and return Bella to safety?\n\nThe game is a loveable continuation to the series, with beautiful background art, hand drawn characters and fairytale design. Game being old, you shouldn't expect a miracle about resolutions though. In tone, it is somewhat childish and carries the nativity of the first game. This time, we are also capable of observing the realm of Isabella a bit more closely, weaved from countless European fairytale references. Our fairy companion - who is also happened to be Bella's godmother - is also present to accompany our quest just like old days, alongside a dragon hatchling named Nessie who joins us just recently. They both have different abilities and interaction options to aid you in your quest.\n\nHOG scenes are quite basic and items are distinguishable despite the age of our graphics. Puzzles are various and a bit more of a challenge compared to the previous game, but item collection is all over the place. Due to your companions' various abilities getting unlocked in a timely manner, you'll keep revisiting different locations over and over again to harvest previously unreachable items. The HOG show down with the AI is still our preferred end game boss battle. Oh, and the ending isn't your usually happily ever after; rather a plot hook for the third game to come.\n\nIn the end, I'd recommend the game if you've played the first one and curious about what is to happen to Isabella. It's not a marvelous HOG, but a pretty little casual adventure game with an enjoyable story outline that would present you 2 hours of game time. Enjoy!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","May 13","true","2.7"," 37 of 37 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","37","37","0","0"

This is a standard version not the extended one, which contains longer story line. The ending for the standard version is abrupt and feels very rushed. This is another proof how some companies are trying to generate more cash creating different versions of the same game. Why? Wouldn't be better to have a full story and create a bonus material not relevant to the story? Anyway, when porting old games to the Steam use CE versions instead to attract new players.\nThe game mechanics is similar to any other HO game, it has good interactive map, which helps a lot when the game becomes repetitive. Some voice acting is very annoying especially those of the helpers. And they go on and on, and you can't skip them. Some of the puzzles are too easy some are pretty illogical.\nIn short I would skip playing these games on Steam but would rather got the web site like Big Fish where these games are coming from. You might even get a better deal there.","August 21, 2014","false","4.9"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","29","30","0","0"

Because it's not the complete version. The game is fun and has a good story but there was more to do and a little more story added in the Collector's Edition. In this version the ending is rather cut short with no explination for the prince's actions, though that part is easy to figure out on your own anyway.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game and if you have the first one then yes, grab this (on sale) and play it. But if not then find another hidden object game to pass the time.","September 1, 2014","false","4.7"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","24","30","0","0"

It has some neat mechanics with the helpers' abilities that you can use to locate hidden items. However, this mechanic can also be a bit of a pain, because you have to scan the whole screen for spots to use these powers, which can turn into a pixel hunting adventure. This may only apply to the harder difficulty, I'm not sure, as that's the only one I played.\n\nThe ending isn't really satisfying, as I guess they are looking to make a follow up. In addition, they claim it has 6+ hours of gameplay, but I beat the game in 3 hours without the use of a walkthrough and did all the puzzles.\n\nI'd recommend it if you like playing Hidden Object Games, but the fact that it can be beaten in half the time claimed was pretty frustrating.","April 21, 2014","true","3.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

It does nothing to make itself as memorable as the first episode; it’s just a generic HOG with a lot of running back and forth.\n\nLong version:Like with most hidden object sequels made years after the original, Princess Isabella 2: Return of the Curse has little to do with the original: it’s just a dime-a-dozen fantasy HOG with stock setups, stock settings, and stock plot.\n\nThe only thing that really ties this game to ‘A Witch’s Curse’ is that we play again as the titular princess, who this time has to rescue her kidnapped infant daughter. This task requires solving a lot of generic puzzles and generic hidden object scenes in order to travel through a generic cursed forest and fairy tale town. The settings look great, but the constant backtracking quickly wears out their charm.\n\nOf course this doesn’t mean that Princess Isabella 2 is bad, but one wonders why it was released as a sequel instead of a new (copycat) franchise– the return of the hidden object duel minigame at the end hardly justified this decision.\nOh, also, this is the standard edition, lacking the bonus chapter that explains quite some about the plot.","November 11, 2015","true","3.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

That opponent returned and kidnapped your baby girl, named Bella. It's up to you to uncurse your lands, as now, darkness spread out of the castle.\n\nAnd that sequel was really well done in terms of story, because I never expected that twist in the end. Now, we're introduced to more creatures: while the fairy is still your helper, you meet villagers, dwarves and even a dragon that will you replace the fairy for a moment!\n\nThe game mechanics are still the same from the previous games: you uncurse the scenes, you free people from their jails or their sleep, you play some puzzles, some HO, you use the dragon or the faery's powers, etc..\n\nThe settings are still wonderful and the soundtrack is still good. I experienced one crash though.\n\nGo for it. Because I wanna know what will happen to Bella and Isabella. And I wanna see the dragon a little more because the voice acting behind it is fantastic.","September 7, 2015","true","1.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Casual/Hidden Object game with some mini games.  There's no counter-intuitive backtracking, no objects appearing in a scene after you've already cleared the area - none of that nonsense which is common in the poorly designed HOB games.   Delivers exactly what you'd expect.     Not worth full price, but definitely worth playing.\n\nI read some reviews which said the game was buggy - I did not encounter any stability issues whatsoever.\n\nMy biggest complaint would be the Hint mechanism - even though the game isn't overly complex you can miss things and get stuck and in some instances the item missed is many scenes back - clicking hint is almost always useless, so you have to have a degree of patience to play it through, backtrack and revisit incomplete scenes.","October 3, 2015","true","5.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Puzzles  are solvable without being to simple.\nIf your not sure what to do,    there is a hint helper on top you can click on that will let you know what\nto do.    Otherwise,  it stays out of site,  for those who do not want hints.\nThere is a WT  on the Big Fish site for when you get really stuck.\nNot sure what the CE  would have,  as seeing I played #3  I knew how the story would end.","August 23, 2014","true","6.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","3"

In addition to the fairy helper from the first game she here gets a dragon companion with different abilities (but clearly the same voice actor).\n\nThe game has 2 difficulty modes, I didn't try the lower one but I assume all the clickables sparkle as they would in similar games. Without the sparkling some clickable areas can be harder to see, but normally not hard enough to get frustratingly lost. The map is helpful and you can teleport to any area, as well as see which areas you have cleared.\n\nI encountered no bugs whatsoever and the game was very enjoyable. The puzzles felt a little harder than in the first game. Most dialogue is skippable with mouseclick.\n\nThough this game seems harder and darker than the first one, it still feels targetted towards kids. Buy it on sale if you liked the first one and/or enjoy this type of game.","May 8, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It also has two modes. Normal mode caters for players that are more casual.  The mode provides many hints, and important areas are always highlighted. Advanced mode on the other hand gives  the player almost no hints.\n\nThere has been some improvement over the first Princess Isabella game, particularly in the art and design of backgrounds.  The game’s areas are more varied than its predecessors were.  And it’s very nice that this time around the witch decided to curse more than just a castle with similarly styled rooms!  The ever-changing scenery also seems to have allowed this instalment to have more quirky characters than its predecessor does.  Although I’m pretty sure those dwarves are living in a hobbit hole!\n\nThe only issue that arose for me when playing this game, as that I came to a puzzle that did not seem to let me manipulate the parts needed to complete it.  Going back to title menu did not fix this.  However, I found that changing the game between screen modes (Fullscreen, Widescreen and Windowed), seemed to allow the game to work out better where the mouse cursor was placed.  So, there is an easy fix if you are to run into this issue.\nI would recommend this game to people who enjoy these types of games.  If you do not go into it looking for a life changing experience, and just enjoy it for what it is, then this is a fun little game, and worth playing.  Bear in mind it is a little short, but worth the price, particularly if you can get it on sale!\n","August 27, 2014","true","6.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"
