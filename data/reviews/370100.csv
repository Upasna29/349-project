Honestly, we have no interest in bashing other "developers" but here we made an exception.\nThe level of laziness, exploitation, and overall dishonesty associated with this "game" is insulting. It is because of games like this that players trust developers less and less and Greenlight is slowly becoming a corrosive garbage dump of incomplete, poorly designed, and in general crummy games.\n\nA couple of months back we had posted a game of ours on Greenlight and it took roughly 6 months for it to get Greenlit. We're not boasting about our game being the best thing since sliced bread, but we sure as hell have been sweating our lower regions to make it. Also, we still have not released in any form. Not Alpha, not Beta, not "Early Access". You know why we haven't released it? Because it's not finished... Then by comparison we have people like this who go and download an asset, pop Unity up, make a build, get Greenlit and immediately try and squeeze a buck out of those who are ignorant to what went down.\n\nA little bit more... at first we weren't even that upset... it was like okay... maybe they tweaked a few things here or there... but no. This "developer" is so lazy, and would even go so far as to say arrogant, that they couldn't even come up with an original description for their "game".\n\n"Sandbox, multiplayer, open world game in a few steps. The game also with several different gameplay modes such as Death Match, Survival Horror, and Zombie Swarm. You can create your world, customize your rules, and enjoy the games with your friends."\n\nThis is the exact paragraph (right down to capitalization and grammatic structure) that is used to market this asset on the Unity Asset Store. https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/26912.

Put in about......oh.. about 15 mins worth of work? And shovel it onto Steam.\n\nNow, as they have done, please make sure you attach Steam Trading Cards to it. That way, people will still buy it for the cards. Classic.\n\nNow, you can take some notes from these developers. They release "updates" every 2 to 3 months. Why is this important? Well, duh, because now it looks like you are actually committed to change and improving your stolen work. Make sure you attach some cool version numbers like 1.2, or 1.5. Extra points if you drag it out to 3 numbers like they have done. Dont worry if the few people who actually play your game complain that your updates did absolutely nothing, and call you a scammer. No one will read them or care. Trust me, its Steam!\n\nNow once this is complete, make sure you buy some new Unity Asset packs. One per game please. Make sure you change the name of your Dev and Publisher so you can avoid any unsightly trash talk until your game has sold enough for you to make some profit.\n\nCongrats! You are now a Steam developer. How does it feel? Dont worry about that layer of filth and dirt all over you. Its natural!\n\nNext time, we will cover advanced tactics, such as pirating the Unity assets for more phat lewts, microtransactions, and of course, getting into fights with popular YouTube personalities!

The loss in time isn't worth the profit you get from the cards. (Please proceed to the summary.)\n\n\nGameplayYou can select from 5 different blocky characters which start with different items (following typos are ingame):\nPoliceman: Spawn with gun and ammunitions\nFarmer: Have an awesom and piece of woods\nSalaryman: Spawn with food and several items\nNoo New: She have everything necessary\nDoctor: Have a medicines and survival kit\nThe game offers 3 different maps (typos in the titles are ingame):\nZombie Land - open world survivor\n- You are set in an open but limited world, can retrieve items and you have to kill zombies.\nSandbox - just for test\n- Here you can try out the game, guns and what not. Unluckily you can't test the crafting system as there are no ressources to find.\nDeath Match - plyers vs players\n- Obviously a map for pvp action.\nYou will have a health, hunger and thirst bar.\nHealth drops on damage.\nHunger decreases over time.\nThirst decreases over time too but quicker.\nIn general you have to live from pickups.\n\nYou run around, find pickups and kill blocky zombies. There are only 2 types of them: Normal ones and (let's call them) raging ones. Latter run faster.\nIf you die you lose everything you collected and respawn. You aren't able to pick up items where you died.\n\nAt the start you may have a gun with limited ammo. You need to find new guns and bullets from pickups.\n\nYou can find wood and metal plates to craft different things, also found as pickups. You can craft rudimentary building parts too. With rudimentary I mean about 5 different parts. Foundation, wall, roof, door, window if I remember correctly.\n\nI'm sorry but I have nothing positive to say about this game.\n\nIssues that really need to be fixed:Most guns shoot multiple or all bullets at once without inflicting any damage or damage equal to one bullet. (The update stating "Fixed shooting" is false!)\nRemapping key bindings is missing, the pop-up menu before starting the game doesn't work either and is missing options like reload or sprint.\nThere is no way to set mouse sensitivity ingame. I could change my mouses' dpi but then it would take ages to drag the cursor in the menues.\nScrolling takes ages, it would be better if one step on the scroll wheel would be equal to one row in the menu. At current state you have to do multiple laps with your mouse wheel per row. The wheel is more convenient than dragging the scroll bar in the heat of the battle.\nTalking about battle: There needs to be a quicker way to swap weapons, for example switching guns by directly using the mouse wheel. At the moment you need to open the item list by pressing [E], (maybe you even need to click & drag the scroll bar), select a weapon by clicking on it, click on "Use", click [E] again to close the menu. Congratulations, you are dead.\nMany other flaws, (this list isn't complete):Broken English.\nThe game doesn't tell you all the controls. For example sprint [SHIFT], reload [R], items menu [E]. These 3 you have to figure out yourself.\nZombies pop up randomly in your proximity, sometimes even a few steps in front of you. Yes, you occasionally watch them spawn and drop on the floor and then running at you.\nZombies that are stuck in the floor. You can only see their heads sticking out of the soil. They run at you but can't damage you. You can't damage them either.\nItems spawning in front of your nose.\nFloating props, items and buildings. (The update stating "Houses do not float in the air" is false!)\nGlitches and inconsistencies in graphics. Sometimes you can see cracks in the floor. Your gun has a shadow but your character model hasn't any.\nThis game has no music at all and you can't change the sound volume.\nThe pause menu (called "Main Menu") only has the options "Resume" and "Disconnect". (Yes, even in single player mode it is called "Disconnect".)\nMultiplayer spawn camping is easier than in any other game I played. No secured area to spawn, no spawn invincibility, spawn points basically next to each other. Position yourself at the side of the spawn points, just wait for spawning enemies and shoot.\nIn multiplayer everyone can join the same team, there is no automated or manual way to balance teams. In addition every time you die you can swap teams.\nMost multiplayer games are not reachable. The seventh game I tried to join finally worked. After I looked for another one I had to check even more games.\nIf you open the chat prompt you can't close it other than writing a message. So if you hit [ENTER] by accident you have to send something.\nLast but not least this game impersonates dishonesty!This game is simply a 1:1 ripoff of this asset package called UnitZ[assetstore.unity3d.com].\nIf you look close enough even the description is a partial copy.\nOriginally posted by Steam store description:Sandbox, multiplayer, open world game in a few steps. The game also with several different gameplay modes such as Death Match, Survival Horror, and Zombie Swarm. You can create your world, customize your rules, and enjoy the games with your friends.Originally posted by Asset store description:This kit can help you to create a sandbox, multiplayer, open world game in a few steps. The pack also comes with several different gameplay modes such as Death Match, Survival Horror, and Zombie Swarm. You can create your world, customize your rules, and enjoy the games with your friends.Sidenote: The game "developer" even forgot to delete "in a few steps" in his stolen description.\n\nAlso take a look at the videos and screenshots on both places. You will see that everything is the same except the name.\n\nAssets from the assetstore are mostly meant to be a base or a nice addition to your own game. In this case UnitZ is meant as foundation and you build your game around it and fix possible issues.\n\nI don't know if the added halloween props are copied/stolen too. It looks like they aren't part of the UnitZ assets. (But maybe from another one).\n\n\nSummaryHere we have an unplayble game as it is broken to a point that you simply won't be able to play it properly. On top of that Uncrowded is a fraud because it is a blatant one-to-one copy in almost every single bit.\nShame on the developer Kotach.\n\nCatastrophic game\nDon't buy and support this game by any means. (Except you are greedy and want to make profit from cards if it is on a 2 cents discount again.)\n\nI never thought I would ever need to give this rating to any game:\n0/10","November 5, 2015","false","1.3"," 183 of 188 people (97%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","97","183","188","38","4"

There's also one that still floats majestically above the map, I can't say where the house is because you're given no ideas for direction in the form of a map or even a compass.\n\nWe made a video on Uncrowded recently which showcases all these problems if you'd like to see them without paying the £1.59 to buy the game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSDwyHi3_n4","June 1, 2015","false","1.3"," 193 of 202 people (96%) found this review helpful 66 people found this review funny","96","193","202","66","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rahu700/recommended/370100/","rahu700","Xenanigans","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rahu700/","142 products in account","First off, I'd like to state that this game is amazing. I only gave it a thumbs down because I'm trying to be innovative, like the developer.\nYou see, Uncrowded isn't just a game. It's a way of life. For instance, the guns in this game don't do any damage, unless your gun is literally inside the zombie's face. The dev himself is an absolute genius for doing this, and only the most cultured individuals would understand.\nMahatma Gandhi himself would have advocated for this. It's a testament to how we shouldn't solve our problems with guns, and how we need to find other ways of solving problems.\nDo you know any other game that has CTRL hotkeyed to shoot? Do you know any other game that lets you punch zombies through walls? Any other game where your fists are more effective than a shotgun?\nOf course you don't, because those games aren't Uncrowded. Some crappier games have attempted to copy the splendor of Uncrowded, but all have failed. I'm looking at you, Unturned. Sure Unturned has cars. but Uncrowded has something else. It has soul, dedication... HEART. Unturned doesn't charge you to play, and is a "f2p" game, but Uncrowded does. This is because the dev himself knew that microtransactions aren't a good business model. Just look at Payday2.\nNot to mention, the game is currently having a Halloween update, even though it's November as of this review. If you didn't experience Halloween in real life, now is your chance.\n...Because, Uncrowded IS real life. When you see those lush landscapes, sprawling pixelated hills, and bold physics, you won't look anywhere else. When the gas station plays motor sounds so loud you feel like your ears will bleed, you know it's real. Because cars are loud in real life.\nThis isn't a game, but if it was, I'd have to applaud the direction it chose. The plot may appear to be paper-thin, but it's not. It really isn't. It just doesnt want to distract you from the captivating gameplay and struggle of the main character.\nSo overall, the campaign is better than Halo Reach. Stop wasting your time with other games and play this, a real man's struggle.\nThanks for reading this review, and hopefully you can understand the motivation of the developer. Not to create a shameless cash grab, but to inspire new and refreshing take on our everyday endeavours in an industralized and modern society.\n\nEDIT: I just discovered that there is indeed a car in the game, even though it's worse than walking and can't reverse. Proof that the developer is trying to discourage the use of fossil fuels and wants to help the environment.","November 20, 2015","false","4.4"," 60 of 62 people (97%) found this review helpful 88 people found this review funny","97","60","62","88","4"

The cards that drop can be sold on the market and you'll get all your money back (actually you'll come out making a profit)\nedit* now that the game's been discounted for a while, the cards are more common and you won't get as big of a return as the first week.\nIf you missed the sale, wait until it is on sale again. This is the only reason to get the game, by the way.\n\nAs you'll read in many other reviews, this is just a Unity asset pack that anyone can buy and build upon to create their own game. What the so called "developer" has done, is taken that asset pack and somehow made it buggier and worse than the original copy they purchased the license to use. That is, if they actually paid for it. Most Unity asset packs, including this one (which, by the way is called Unit Z by the original creator) apparently is very easy to torrent/pirate so who knows. Since they haven't added any of their own content as the asset pack intended, none of this is actually the work of the "developer" outside of some code they have changed.  They manipulated the shortcomings and exploits of greenlight to get this greenlit despite it being nothing more than this. https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/26912\n\nTheir other game "The District" is the exact same scenario.\n\nBy the way, you might notice at the beginning of the trailer on the store page, it says "Field Z" instead of "Uncrowded"  Why?

It was worth every penny of the $0.19 that I gave up to play this. So here's a rundown of all the features that make this game a canidate for Game of the year 2015.\n\n1. Combat: Never before have I ever played a game with a combat mechanic as unique as this. Whenever you click to fire a gun, you expect it to fire one bullet, but not in Uncrowded. Nope, Uncrowded has gone the extra mile by making it so whenever you fire a gun, it unloads the entire ammo clip in one earsplitting volley (Note: firing seven bullets at once does not deal the damage of 7 bullets, in fact, 9/11 times all the bullets will miss). Also, never before in any game has a more shoddy Melee mechanic been developed. The range for all weapons is concistent, meaning that, whether you're armed with a flashlight or a fireaxe, you're going to run up to a zombie and take 10 damage if you want to kill the zombie. Also, the damage recieved by player characters and npcs from melee weapons is not consistent, i.e. you're able to one hit a player with a flashlight, but with a fireaxe, it takes 2 -3 hits to kill a player. Meanwhile zombies will take 2 - 3 hits with a flashlight and only 1 with the fireaxe (Update: June 29th 8:43 p.m. After more experiments, the flashlight is offically the most op weapon. It can down ANYTHING in 1 hit at a cost of 10 -20 damage). Turely a combat mechanic as amazing and aweinspiring as this has never been seen before.\n\n2. Game sounds: Most people would consider it a bug when the sound of another person (in multiplayer) picking up items is broadcast to everyone on the server no matter where they are, but it's just another one of those charming features that makes Uncrowded so irrisitable. There is literally no doplar effect in the game, meaning that zombies will make the same amount of noise whether they are 40 yards away from you, or right behind you. This often leads to countless ♥♥♥ rapings since you never know whether or not a zombie is behind you. (Note: an easy fix to this is to just spin in circles for the entire game).\n\n3. "Special" Zombies: Uncrowded has three very special and unique types of zombies. First, there are the regular zombies which will start gaily jumping towards the player out of sheer excitement of finally finding a potential target to ♥♥♥ rape. Second, are the magical Big Black Satan zombies that dwell deep in the woods. These zombies almost always spawn next to the "re spawn" points, which means after you "re spawn" you're going to get ♥♥♥ raped again. They deal a ludicrous amount of damage and there seems to be no spawn cap, which means three of these over grown ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are going to be somewhere on the map, ready to pounce upon the player's virgin booty. Third are the super amazing teleporting zombies. If you want to keep you're player safe by camping out on a roof top, it's certain that one of these will spawn directly behind the player. The player will then be ♥♥♥♥♥ in the ♥♥♥ and die.\n\n4. Day and Night cycles: Because if getting ♥♥♥ raped in the day wasn't fun enough, getting ♥♥♥ raped in the night (slightly darker day) is twice the fun.\n\n5. Cars: Actually, there's only one car which can go about 0.4 miles an hour, when it's not gliching out or getting stuck on the road. However, the car is the most op weapon since it is the only thing that will one hit a zombie, provided there is only one directly infront of the hood. If there is more than one zombie, the car will flip over and you will die. The car also does jackshit when it comes to protecting the player from zombies, since they can easily jump ontop of the car and proceed to hug and ♥♥♥ rape the player to death. (Update: June 29th, 8:42 p.m. if the pc enters the car after it rolls over, and exits it, the pc will be catapulted about 50 feet in the air and die on impact with the ground)\n\n6. The name: The game is way more crowded than the title suggest. The town, surrounding woods, and farms are constantly patrolled by the 3rd Zombie Platoon: Silent ♥♥♥ Raping Division.\n\n7. Construction: Apparently it's possible to erect a dwelling of your very own, but you're mostlikely going to get ♥♥♥ raped by the silent zombies before you can gather enough materials.\n\n8. Realistic need bars: Your pc will get hunrgy and thirsty, which can be solved by selecting any food or drink item in the inventory and literally throwing the food in your face.\n\n9. Sprint mechanic: Your character can sprint forever.\n\nClearly, this game is amazing. It has almost every feature a person could want, killing, krafting, and keating. It's obviouly better than any other game that has been or ever will be released. Instead of paying $69.69 for Fallout 4, just buy this. It's got all the same features and is twice as fun, and twice as broken.\n\nUpdate June 30th, 2015: A steam user by the name of Red has kindly pointed out to me that Uncrowded is not a game. I have to completely agree with him. Despite the makers of the game literally calling Uncrowded a game in their description, Uncrowded is 100%, undoutable, not a game. Uncrowded is an experience for an individual. Uncrowded is an ♥♥♥ raping simulator. Uncrowded is a software that can be downloaded onto the hard drive of your very own personal computer and executed via a desktop shortcut then played for countless hours with friends and/or by your self. So thank you, Red, for kindly bringing that to my attention, Uncrowded is definatly not a game, its it's own special entity all on it's own.","June 29, 2015","true","2.4"," 251 of 381 people (66%) found this review helpful 396 people found this review funny","66","251","381","396","18"

Minecraft being a successful game and all these devs rushing to make games just like it. Stupid if you ask me. for 9 cents on the steam store I think I want my money back.","September 1, 2015","false","2.8"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","28","29","3","4"

It is a ripoff from other ripoff games.\n\nThe mouse lag in this game is horrible and the sensitivity cannot be customized. It is unbearable to move the mouse throughout the game and hard to aim at enemies.\n\nThe hit detection is broken as bullets just fly through enemies most of the time. Also, the third alternative fire, I believe, literally fires a fury of bullets no matter the weapon, be it pump action shotguns and even the sniper rifle.\n\nZombie spawns are fairly broken as some of them tend to spawn within houses and get stuck. One of the zombies, a "black" zombie, is overpowered as it senses a human player no matter the range and moves way too fast, killing quite easily.\n\nHardly any zombies do spawn by the way in the huge map, making gameplay very boring after five minutes.\n\nMultiplayer is NOT functional at all, I either receive a disconnect or failure to join.\n\nIn summary, the game developer(s) were at least nice to put this game at a very good discount and the trading cards that come with it are more valuable than two cents, thus a nice profit is earned for enduring this stinking, rotten pile of horse turd. Still, this game is very badly made and is without a doubt, a cash-grab that should have never been greenlit.\n\n===\n\nIf this review is too long, here's a shorter summary. The game is more broken than a d!ck snapped in half.\n\n===\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI take back anything I said nice about the developer(s). Some butthurt f*gg-ot banned be for this reason:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/s6fiylq6xhj9y57/Screenshot%202015-11-02%2011.20.39.png?dl=0\n\nIn conclusion, I feel like a rich man for buying the game at 2 cents, receiving 3 cards totalling around 18 cents, and then requesting a refund as I played the game for only 1 hour.","October 30, 2015","false","1.1"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","97","28","29","9","0"

I think it deserves game of the year and i am looking forward to no further content. This game may have given me cancer but in doing so it also made me cancer therefore i could not get cancer. I always loved unturned and was my favorite game before i was saved by this rendering quality. This games graphics are from at least 2991 because you will never see anything as good. The server connection is what gives this game its high quality because instead of playing the game, why not just wait to get in a game instead. I will never leave this game and there are so many different ways to play the game like killing zombies or maybe killing zombies!!!! Another one of the good characteristics of this game is the racism and how black zombies go super pimp cocain mc fast and you can also be bruce lee and punch there ♥♥♥♥♥ asses away. There is no grind and it just gives you cancer so it will save you from the non-cancerous people. The fact that bullets dont effect the zombies is among the best characteristics of this game.

This games gives me so much joy and whoever ♥♥♥♥ing thinks that this is a rip off of unturned then they are right and it makes it even better!!!!!

But man. This..?\nI can't even say anything positive about this.\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nThe game is completely and utterly BROKEN. I tried joining and restarting the game several times, however, this didn't keep my character from walking on his own :-)\n\nFurthermore, even without this handicap, this game is UNPLAYABLE. I saw multiple bugs and glitches. Such as zombies not taking damage / Being able to eat food multiple times / Zombies turning into trees / Zombies walking into the corner of a room, then suddenly dying out of nowhere, I can go on, but don't feel like even wasting the time.\n\nWhen I died and waited a few minutes to respawn, the game crashed and gave me a crash report, telling me it would be great if I sent that to the developer of the game. I have better advice for the developer of this game: STOP.\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nIn conclusion I deeply REGRET paying 2 cents for this, and paying another 2 cents to gift it to a friend as well. Buying a Steam emoticon would have been much more rewarding.\n\nDon't buy this game.\n\n[NOTE: If anything, this game is good for earning your money back by selling the cards it drops for more than you paid for the game, hooray.]\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬","November 21, 2015","false","3.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

There are times when the indie game scene is rather slow, but that is because the true masterminds that are responsible for opening up this very platform of indie gaming. Specifically reffering to The Behemoth.\n\nIndie gaming is very important and Steam Greenlight is a mixed bag between success and this. Even when the Indie Games were blowing up these developers needed a publisher, this is why Steam Greenlight was such a great idea. Most of the games 'greenlit' are only purchased because you can profit off of their Steam Trading Cards.\n\nLet me now explain why the developers should feel ashamed of doing this. The developing company, The Behemoth is the father of indie games. They put their game on the GameCube and PS2, Alien Hominid. Was a minor success which got got it ported to the Xbox and Game Boy Advance. This is my own research but I can affirm this as the first multi-platform indie game at this capacity. Knowing this, the Uncrowded developers here literally put 5 minutes of effort to get this game on Steam. The same amount of time their development process took.\n\nThis game is an act of laziness. I wouldn't call a homeless man on the streets a 'bum' because that is rude. The developers are truly bums. I mean this game is literally the equivalant of selling a pre-made DIY kit, you can read other reviews from more details on what I mean. These people are the worst coders that they cannot even edit pre-made lines.\n\nThis game is insulting. Team Meat, The Behemoth, Derek Yu (Spelunky), and various of great indie developers made enormous risks, their creations could've never seen light if a publisher rejected them. Every indie developer should keep that in mind that it is wrong to take advantage of a system like GreenLight.","September 7, 2015","false","3.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"
