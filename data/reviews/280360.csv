I want to like it. For years I've been looking for a subsequent continuation of Star Control 2's Gameplay (one of my favorite games of all time), and while this comes close, it's suffering from several small issues and 1 massive issue.\n\nI'm 8 hours in, and I've literally explored the entire universe. That leaves a bad taste in my mouth. That should not happen in a game that allows you to freely travel an entire universe. There are too many planets with nothing to do on them, and there's too much space on the map that is just empty. No planets have moons, no planets circle a sun,every star system is 1 planet, there is no variation in gravity from planet to planet, but there are temperature "biomes" that encompass an entire planet, there are no gas giants, or variations of types of planets either, no satellites, no leftover or abandoned tech, nothing, just lots of nothing on a planetary scale, no planetary info, no day/night cycles, just a static marble in the vast emptiness.\n\nSave yourself the money and go play Star Control 2 (also known as Ur-Quan Masters), which is from the 1990s, free, is better than Mass Effect (yes I said that), and even has voice acting.\n\nDevelopers of Interstellaria...\n\nAllow players to make hotkeys of crew members/management for easier control and selection.\nAllow players to make hotkeys of ships in their fleet, just like any RTS game.\nAllow players to save what crew members man what stations and tie that to a single button for ease of use.\nFix the enemy AI, as the game is too easy to play through. I can literally fight anything with 1 ship (that is 1 step removed from the starting ship) and win without being touched. I can also fight anything with 3 crew members with a basic pistol and kill them with ease.\nAdjust the weapon systems to be able to fire alternately, tie it to a key, and create a button to fire them all - just look at FTL for christ sake.\nAdd a timeline system for the universe to change as time passes. Make those influence circles increase, shrink, or move as territories change hands between races, or just have the circles change size based on which race is winning more fleet fights.\nAllow more conversations to take place in space between friend and foe alike, hostile ships never open up hailing frequencies, and I have NOT ONCE found a use for hailing a ship as friendly ships auto-hail you, and enemy ships never accept your hails - why is this button in the game?\nI see you've included a fast forward button because you realized how much waiting was involved in the ground/exploration systems - while I appreciate that, that's a bad design sign from step 1. If you need it, that speaks volumes for your design choice from the drawing board.\n\nI can keep going. I have a degree in this field and have worked on AAA titles. I want to like this game, but it isn't done, there's too much emptiness to it, and there's so much more that could be done.","July 18, 2015","false","7.8"," 608 of 727 people (84%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","84","608","727","18","32"

I can only pray that Chucklefish gets these guys to fix the game. Then they can fix Starbound.\n\nTL;DR - Interesting concept that will not tickle your Terraria/Starbound itch. Poor design choices and rough presentation.\n\nPros?\n\n- Awesome pixel art.\n- Charming attempt at customization.\n- Interesting space combat that you can definately get absorbed into.\n- Real exploraton that functions as a method of earning money and supplies.\n- Very simple.\n- Hands free function on exploration.\n\nCons?\n\n- Outside of space combat, there is nothing that's intriguing.\n- Huge amounts of time spent feeling like you're AFK. Until pathing is broken. And then you're annoyed about that.\n- Money is easy to find. Planets are farmable and I have not once seen where Valuable Metals or something has not been in demand in the HQ. This makes buying ships and crew far too easy.\n- Clunky UI. UI windows that interact with eachother horribly. (Two menus up? You just hit the menu behind the one you wanted to.)\n- Annoying bugs. Like randomly generated astroids that are generated so that you cannot get back to your ship.\n- Bugs. Like the kind where mapping where certain crew members.. ahem.. most crewmembers need you to physically walk them up stairs or jumps.\n- Like a lot of bugs. A little less with the new update.\n- Hands free fuction on exploration. Crew members die. All the time.\n\nConclusion?: Starbound exists. FTL exists. They both do what this game intends to do better. Play those instead.\n\nEDIT: Chucklefish isn't the dev for this game, silly. Added some more pros and cons. WIll continue to update as game is updated, unless it isn't. Steam might be seeing an influx of return requests soon. Lol.\n\nEDIT II: I'm getting comments that make it seem as though people are misconstruding the fact that I am not  reviewing a triple A title for an article on Destructoid or something. I am going on the information that I acquired through nothing but my gameplay experience. Just as 90% of consumers do. This is a user review. If you're looking for a college length essay, perhaps look elsewhere, as there isn't enough about this game to go into immense detail. I added some more discussion about bugs, but I won't be updating further. As I hear of bug fixes I might. We'll see.\n\nEDIT III: I've been told to revisit some of the points I made. As someone else has stated, Steam gives me the option to either negatively or positively rate this game. There is no "circumstantially" button next to "Do you reccommend this game?" However, that is indeed my true answer. This game is fun and interesting but poor design choices caused it to royally flop. I enjoyed that sapce combat was simple and floaty. I did not like that when I was out of space combat there was cirtually nothing to do.\n\nSee my cons section. A series of nitpicks, maybe. But you would most likely have the same issues with the game as well.\n\nI bought this game for myself and a friend. I was excited to play and I went into it with an open-mind. I'm just looking to save you your money on a game that isn't worth your time.\n\nI did do some rewording and spelling error fixes though. < 3","July 17, 2015","false","1.9"," 235 of 324 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","235","324","8","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gabeux/recommended/280360/","gabeux","Gabeux","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gabeux/","235 products in account","This game was on my "wait list" for a long while - since they announced its Kickstarter.\nI was not a backer, nor a Early Access founder - I have been burned by enough EA projects by now, so I rather buy things on release. And that's what I did with Interstellaria.\n\nBefore I get any more personal, I'll review the game for you for what it is.\nIt's important to start with what this game is and what this game isn't - as appearances can crush many expectations!\n-\n\nSPACE. The final frontier. Or is it?\nIn Interstellaria, you control a fleet of up to 5 ships along with the big crew to man all the stations, in adventures across the galaxy.\n\nWHAT IS INTERSTELLARIA? Better described as Very Lite FTL [Faster Than Light, game] meets Very Lite Starbound.\nTactical Space Combat with planetside exploration and combat with away teams, with infinite amounts of nostalgia - all made, for the most part, by the hands of a single person.\nWhat Interstellaria isn't: IT IS -NOT- a complete dynamic sandbox of procedural exploration.\nIn summary, Interestallaria is completely linear and static. For example:\n- Economy: goods are always in full supply in Planet A, and always in full demand at Planet B. No price fluctuations. No economy.\n- Simulation-wise: Space Combat encounters are random and have no influence on the game universe. Same can be said by Ground Combat - mob spawns are fixed and always respawned after leaving and reentering the same planet.\n- Story-wise: There's a single ending and there's no decisions to be made - the story is linear and directed.\nTherefore, mind your expectations before buying!\n\nThe CONTROL SCHEME is straightforward, with hotkeys for all screens. Right-Click usually involves moving around and assigning orders, left-click usually examines or sets a target (in space combat). The INTERFACE is easy to use and understand, and brings much nostalgia.\n\nGRAPHICS and SOUND are amazing. It's a 10/10 in my book. If you like chiptune, you'll probably want to acquire the soundtrack. And again, the graphics bring much delicious nostalgia for those who either played or watched someone playing Space DOS games back in the 90's.\n\nCONTENT, STORY and EXPLORATION are rather limited, even though the game might take the "default" 15-20 hours to complete and explore. This is where Interestellaria gets weird and easy to criticize: you'd expect much more from a "Fully Explorable Galaxy". Not only that, but ALL LANDABLE PLANETS have "Breathable Atmospheres" - there's ZERO Survival or Life Support component in the game. Even though there's a in-game/in-universe explanation for that, it feels really cheap and left out.\nThe plot itself is good and interesting enough, but there's too little universe lore to support anything more than that. And the lack of different endings or actual choices throws the opportunity of a real "Space Epic" experience down the drain.\n\nThis doesn't mean that the game isn't OPEN WORLD. You are free to forget about the plot and explore the available universe, trade and build your fleet at any time. I actually got my Kurshan Cruiser as soon as I could, and then I followed the story.\n\nCUSTOMIZATION and MICROMANAGEMENT is existant to a certain extent in the game:\n- RACES: You choose which race to recruit for your crew, and some races might have constraints applied to them. Bashiens, for instance, don't wear armor. Some kinds of robots never level up, while Drones do. Whatever other variables, though, is not exposed by the game. So I don't know if humans gain XP faster and Kurshans deal more melee damage, etc.\n- TRAITS: Your crew can also pick up traits, which is a very interesting system to have. However, most traits are bad or silly. And by the end of my game, everyone who could have a negative Gathering trait, had it.\n- CREW CUSTOMIZATION: You can choose which equipment to put on the Helmet, Armor, Legs, Weapon and Augmentation slots of your crew. There are certain "Vanity" items dropped by mobs, which is a nice touch.\n- AUGMENTATIONS: Make characters even more unique - some augmentations simply give more health, others might be weirder and make your crewman shoot lasers. Still, there's a lack of variety here, and augmentations are rather hard and rare to come by.\n- SHIP CUSTOMIZATION: You can pick which modules and levels for each ship station, and where they'll be positioned on the ship. This is really cool, since you can tailor ships for different roles - you can even crew a ship only with robots to save space and time! Further Ship customization would help make ships really unique, though.\n- SHIP EQUIPMENT: There's a decent amount of weapons, and each race specialize in a different weapon types.\n- CREW MANAGEMENT: You can assign crew for different stations, or order them to eat, have fun, sleep or heal. If a crewman is not allocated to any station, he'll take care of his needs himself - but if left unwatched while allocated, he might leave your command next time you land..which makes it rather frustrating. Therefore, currently, Crew Management is rather weird and unwiedly. It's manageable with a single organic-crewed ship, but needs improvement. (My solution to ignore micromanaging issues was to crew my other ships with robots).\n- This might be a good time to warn you: there's NO CRAFTING in the game.\n\nSPACE COMBAT is not as complex and chaotic as FTL, but is very fun and cool in its own way. You actually move your ship around in a screen, and can dodge and position yourself at will. Taking hull damage might cause hull breaches, damage ship stations or cause fires. There's NO BOARDING mechanic in the game, which is rather disappointing.\nCurrently, Space Combat is too easy and has no variety, unfortunately.\n\nGROUND COMBAT is simple, but needs improvement. Right-clicking a target will give a single move/attack order to your crew, who might stop attacking after the first blow, or not. Pressing G or clicking the Guard button will make your crew automatically attack nearby enemies, which makes it much easier and faster, but your crew can still stop attacking the target. The bosses are actually surprising, but usually the low ammo capacity forces you to fall back to the ship to resupply and heal before a boss fight, which feels cheap, completely breaks immersion and makes the game lose all of its character.\n\nREPLAYABILITY is probably null. I've finished the game, got all the achievements, and there's no point to replay the game - unless a big content update hits us.\n\nCONVENIENCE is bad in this game. Menus don't use the mouse wheel, trading goods requires you to single-click for each item unit, transferring power between the ship's systems will have you click multiple times for each energy unit, you can't access you ship's cargo hold while landed, and there's NO AUTOSAVE at all in the game. Therefore, most things that can be boring for the player, will be. At least "Harvesting" is automated - but it can largely be ignored by trading instead.\n\nAbout BUGS and ISSUES: Post-launch, players had many problems, ranging from simple UI issues and typos, to save-game corrupting bugs. I managed to finish the game without major issues, even though I had to reload a few times and probably lost one or two hours with that. Constant saving is necessary.\nIt's important to note, however, that the developer released two patches in two days - on the same day of release - and through the weekend.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThere's a lot of bad inside and around Interstellaria - there's no denying. No matter how much you want to love the game, you'll probably end up hating on it instead.\nBut that's when you have to remember what the game is: a linear, static, light hybrid space adventure game that costs 10 USD, made by a single person.\n\nI've reached my word limit, so I'll end by saying I actually enjoyed it, and smiled at the end - the galaxy is saved, and mankind is, once again, free and safe. Or is it?\nMixed Feelings alright. :)","July 19, 2015","true","19.3"," 94 of 115 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","94","115","6","2"

I was so hyped about it that I didn't even wait for a sale...\n\nFrom the first time I heard of this game, it was portrayed as a blend between two favorites of mine, Starbound and FTL; combining FTL's epic space combat and Starbound's limitless exploration.\n\nThis game has neither.\n\nSpace combat is a bit challenging while you're still on the starting ship, that has no shields. But once you get a shield or a decent speed, it becomes child's play. What you don't easily dodge by moving around, you shields will suck it up like a sponge. And once you get bigger ships like Kursha Cruiser and slap some Death Rays to it, then you're set up for life; nothing will ever give you a challenge.\n\nOn the exploration, for a game whose developer was in clearly in contact with Chucklefish, it's ABSOLUTELY NOTHING like Starbound's exploration (unless you count the platformer part). Of the few dozens of planets available, you can only explore two or three, and most of these have absolutely nothing but a fistful of resources you can collect, and some won't let you land till you're doing certain mission of the Main Story, which is the other bad part. And this is all without mentioning how buggy are the whole pathlines your characters follow; you'll have to get used to them suddenly stopping over a stair step because they failed to jimp over it.\n\nThe Main Story is just a linear and uninspiring streamline of Fetch Quest; go talk to this quest giver, go to this planet, kill all the monsters, find the quest object, grab all resources, go back to your ship, return to quest giver, rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat FOR HOURS. And the slow space travel only makes this even more tedious, as some quests send you to the other corner of the map just to talk to some guy or fetch some Space MacGuffin.\n\nThe only thing I admit I enjoyed is the Soundtrack; which is quite good, but soundtrack alone doesn't make a game.\n\nSo, to sum up, if you're looking for a epic space-faring experience, filled with exploration, twisted plots of intrigue and a really challenging combat... go play something else. I'd reccomend you Freelancer, which has all of the above sans the exploration part. You can try Starbound for that one.\n\nThis game is a waste of money...","January 14","false","29.1"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","39","45","0","5"

Interstellaria has a lot of good points to it, it's essentially an adventure based FTL, and damn it's fun. You manually fly your ship during fights to avoid enemy fire, you manage a crew and have them man different stations for different effects, it's just a lot of fun. There are unfortunately so many bugs and inconveniences that the game borders on unplayable.\n\n- Incredibly tiny universe. I'm not too far into the game, and I'm hoping the game holds more in store than what I've currently gotten to, but as it stands, there looks to be only about 40 planets, less than half of which are explorable, and a large portion of the 'explorable' ones are simply ports to sell goods I can no longer find because I've harvested everything in the universe, and parts/ships I can't buy because I can now only make small change hunting the same ships over and over.\n-The sound and graphical options don't save, so unless you want to play in a low resolution windowed mode, you have to redo your options on every launch.\n- Keyboard shortcuts sometimes don't work on the first press. I'm really not sure what triggers this, but usually any time I try a keyboard shortcut if I haven't used the keyboard for a minute or so, I'll have to double press it.\n- Can only see a single team member's health at a time. This forces the player to constantly rotate between crew members for fear that someone is near death.\n- Can't see ship part descriptions in the fleet menu. Want to compare power use of MKII and MKIII parts? Well, you'll have to take the current one off your ship, leave the menu, go into the inventory, decide which one you want to use, leave the inventory, open the fleet menu and put the part down.\n\nAnd the list goes on. All in all, this game just feels unfinished, and if the creators can consider this 'good enough' to be called a full release and start working on something else, I can't see them getting around to fixing too much.\n\nEdit July 27: So, I haven't played the game with any of the most recent updates, but I just want to say really quickly that Chuckle Fish has proven me wrong by tossing fixes and improvements at the game as quickly as they can. I really do appreciate the team working their butts off.","July 19, 2015","false","3.9"," 65 of 90 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","65","90","0","11"

It could be fun, but it is buggy and has a inconsistent UI. I had to look twice before writing this review to be sure its not a beta/kickstarter.\n\nMicromanaging your crew is a pain because they often choose to stand on the same place. On planets you can at least see the name of the crew member you have selected (but only one even when you have selected more than one), but on your ship you have to guess because the part of the UI that should show you the selected member is now used by the status of your ships  shield. So have fun fiddling arround to make your crew members do what is needed to survive a combat situation.\n\nSomething like a list of your crew on a sidebar where you can select and, also very important, see which of your members you have actually selected when selecting more than one would be a great improvement.\n\nWhen you are unlucky the pathfinding decides that your crew is now stuck\ninto the ground, which means that you will lose them for good.\n\nI would suggest to wait before buying, its not an expensive game, but without the bugs and with a working UI the game would be so much better.\n\n","July 18, 2015","false","2.7"," 64 of 92 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","64","92","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoldenHopper1983/recommended/280360/","GoldenHopper1983","Ryebread","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoldenHopper1983/","205 products in account","I helped Kickstart this game a few years ago, and while I did get newsletters on its progress through its development period, I opted not to read them for a better surprise when the game was officially released.\n\nNow that it has and I've had a chance to play it through from start to finish, I find myself tragically disappointed. While it does offer some degree of fun, it's only a bland variety of it. Through its automated processes, repetitive grinding, and tired dialogue, I'd group this game more with the likes of Cookie Clicker instead of FTL or Starbound.\n\nMy chief complaint has to be Interstellaria's universe and how shallow it is. True, there are numerous planets you can travel to. You can land on some to explore and harvest its resources and battle its inhabitants. You can travel and trade and build up a fleet. However, those planets I mentioned earlier? You can't land anywhere you want on them, but only on select landing zones the game offers you. Some planets can't be landed on at all, and some planets only offer a single static zone to be explored and quickly forgotten about.\n\nIn fact, nearly everything in Interstellaria's universe is static, from the resources that respawn in the exact same spot 20 minutes later, to the enemies that respawn in the exact same spot 20 minutes later, to the rare enemy NPCs who respawn and mindlessly repeat their pre-battle dialogue in the exact same spot 20 minutes later. All this just tells the player "You can never change this universe in any meaningful way". That's disheartening for a game about galactic exploration and interaction.\n\nI emphasived "20 minutes later" because of the game's respawn mechanic. Everytime you enter a landing zone and later leave it, a timer appears that counts down from 20 minutes. After that, the zone is fully replenished with resources and enemies, irregardless what happened on it previously. However, it also serves a more frustrating purpose. The game promises "worlds with special rewards"; those rewards are randomized drops of weapons/armor, and if you want to kit out your NPC crew with better gear, you'll likely have to go through a lot of grinding sessions, separated by boring 20 minute waits. You can do anything you want in those 20 minutes, but that usually means you'll be replacing that wait with even more tedious grinding in a different part of the game.\n\nWhen you look at the NPCs you control, it doesn't get any better. You can recruit a large crew from a large pool of alien species, but the differences between individual crew members (as well as aliens as a whole) are largely cosmetic. Some aliens can wear armor while others can't. Some aliens need sleep/food while others don't. There is no noticeable difference in how well they perform either. In space battles, you'll assign them to stations/tasks and forget about them. During landing expeditions, you have no imperative to do anything beyond selecting your crew en masse and commanding them to auto-attack a single enemy/area or selecting the auto-harvest command (which tells your crew to strip the entire map of resources). Any single NPC will rarely become particularly important, and will just be another generic face in the crowd as far as your needs as a player are concerned.\n\nWorst yet, among other glitches, the game's NPCs suffer from pathing issues. NPCs you control move when you select a location they should move to, and calculate their path based on that. However, you'll sometimes find your NPCs stuck on obstacles or constantly missing a jump over a gap. One planet has a landing zone filled with tiny gaps your NPCs will have to hurdle, and it is common for players to have their NPCs constantly tediously repeating and failing the same jump.\n\nI clocked in a bit under 24 hours for this game, but that's because I took my time to build up a sizable fleet of ships and crew. If you go with the bare basics (you'll only ever need one well-equiped ship and crew), you should finish this game's story in under 8 hours. The story itself is filled with boring fetch quests and tedious instructions of "Go to A then Go to B". It's fun to build up a fleet that will steamroll over any AI opposition, but that's only fun in the same way of building up a cookie-clicking empire in Cookie Clicker; fun to see how big it will get, but unsatisfying in any other way. With so many better and deeper space exploration games already out on Steam, I absolutely cannot recommend Interstellaria.\n\nP.S.: If it makes any difference, the game will have updates in the future to add more free content, and the developer is currently testing a new UI interface that should make the game's data easier for the player to understand.","March 20","false","22.6"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","2"

No.\nBut I would defenitely recommend it over the FTL that was initially launched as it has a lot of potential to be a great game in the future and Coldrice seems to want that as well.\n\nNote for casual gamers: This game does NOT hold your hand until the end; 30min in and you are off rails.\nYou will have to pay attention to what you are told, not pick fights you can't take on (yet) and be careful during planetary sections as your characters permadie.\nOh... and be sure to save often (F8 for quick save). The game autosaves at points, but typically not in your favour :)\n\nCompared directly to FTL:- no random universe\n- little replay value once beaten\n- far less difficult (save-scumming and farming are present; poorly balanced)\n- it's very easy to dodge shots compared to the AI (which is typically slow as a snail)\n- less random factor for encounters (and they will repeat in a playthrough, but not excessively)\n- despite being open-world, some planets "unlock" only as the story progresses\n- no ship boarding\n- can't vent the ship to put of fires\n- some missions that are part of the story arc can be very boring (the fetch X stuff ones, to be more specific)\n- poor crew management UX (though changes were promised)\n- can't navigate dialogs using the number keys\n- despite having more ships, they are far less diverse and poorly balanced\n= plenty of random encounters (many quite funny)\n= very similar art-style; ships and UI included\n= interesting alien species (most of them recruitable)\n= permadeath for characters\n= characters can be renamed\n= you have to manage your ship's power wisely\n= doesn't hold your hand (except for the beginning)\n+ can explore most planets (some will not be initially explorable)\n+ ground combat (very simple; no aiming; shots only on the X axis)\nit gets a lot more difficult later on, requiring hit-and-run tactics and effective tanking\n+ dynamic tactical space combat (you get to move the ship during combat on a 2D minimap)\n+ plenty of content to keep you busy (it opens up as you progress the story; some hidden side-quests as well)\nmost of the planets will be available as soon as you get the starmap, but some are hidden/can't land on as part of the story arc\n+ less difficult (despite being more complex)\nthe difficulty does ramp up as you progress the story, but you should be able to keep up\n+ less random factor for encounters (you are very likely to get all of them in one playthrough)\n+ you can field a fleet of up to 5 ships, each with their own crew\n+ rich ship customisation\n+ interesting plot that guides you through the universe (with some backstory as well)\n+ plenty of exploration to do (and it is very rewarding!)\n+ characters can gain traits in time and can also be augmented\n+ AWESOME soundtrack (CHIPZEL rocks!)\n\nIssues that should be kept in mind:- sound sometimes cuts off completely on planetary sections\n- CTD when getting a free Sholdro crewmember - fixed\n- though it only happened once, I had to reload my game as one of my guys was bumped out of the map by a critter - fixed\n- no 16:10 support for 1920x1200 resolution; horizontal black bars instead and you can't scroll the view using the mouse up or down if you go outside the 1920x1080 viewport\n- had only one CTD, but others have reported more in the forums (and many have already been reported as fixed in the patches)\n- autosave is fairly limited and typically not of much help as it always overwrites your previous slot; also, sometimes it doesn't autosave at all until you do a manual save\n+ a couple of more which were quickly fixed\n\nDeveloper support:Coldrice is very active, already publishing several fixes since launch and holding up to all his promises.\n\nImprovements to the crew management UI are planned.","July 19, 2015","true","77.3"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","1"

It is a game that plays like very few games, and can take some getting used to, but once you do you'll be tooling around the universe trading, upgrading ships, exterminating dinosaurs, collecting a crew of the galaxy's most prominant races, and helping to unveil some dark secrets.

It was simple, charming and again simple to play. Characters you've started with seem to always be something different so it adds a nice mixture of crewmen to have on a ship. The story led you to some boss fights that were entertaining, especially the finale.\n\nBut what is it to call a universe if there's only one planet with each star? I mean, a universe if possibly "infinite" in all direction so space itself would have been much more fun for the exploration-esque if it goes beyond the unknown.\n\nPros:\n+ Basic yet charming pixel characters and art\n+ Simplistic, interesting 2D combat\n+ Nice story to get going on\n+ Colorful planets to see and some even have some secrets to them.\n+ Exploration was promising and fun for a while\n\nCons:\n- Big ol' nothing of space with nothing to much to got anywhere further from the area you're in.\n- Some amounts of planets that have literally no function other than to look pretty.\n- Endgame leaves almost nothing left to do than killing things and salvaging.\n- Again, planets. Barely enough to go around and with one planets for one star system.\n- Here's a big one: Not enough variety of ships to fly in and the only few "big" ones to fly were the cruisers and there were especially some ships that you CANNOT use, such as the boss ships that you fight during the campaigns.","August 9, 2015","false","7.2"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

I was expecting a FTL or Starbound type game, where I could take my spaceship and do whatever I want across the universe. What I got was a single, linear experience with zero to no customization of my crew or ship and while the gameplay is unique it feels empty as for missions you mass your crew and send them shooting through a long tunnel and then hit the fast forward button while they harvest everything on the map for several minutes(Or longer if they all decide to go to the same item, halfway across the map, and one grabs it, and the rest all go for the same item on the other side of the map, stupid pathfinding), then you get in the ship and wait for several minutes as it travels across the map. The combat is shallow only having a few weapons from what I can tell, and a few ship types. As long as you have enough power in engines and other systems, you can always get by without ever even getting hit as you can pretty much dodge bullets and the AI is too stupid to be dangerous. I've never died once in this game, or felt any danger, and the crew management during space travel is annoying as my people have to eat, sleep and watch a TV or they ♥♥♥♥♥ at me, and do not automatically just leave their systems to do so.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/humbleyak/recommended/280360/","humbleyak","Yak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/humbleyak/","9 products in account","Introduction\nNote: I don't have the achievements for it, but I have indeed completed the game in full.\n\nSpace, the final frontier, endlessly vast and impossible to conquer; or in Interstellaria's case, fairly small and easily overcome. Interstellaria is a platform, shoot 'em up, space sim mash-up that—while combining all of these into a satisfactory package—doesn't do any of them exceptionally well. But that's not to say it doesn't have its upsides.\n\nGameplay\nInterface, Options & Controls\n\nThe interface is easy to understand, sometimes a bit quirky and in dire need of more hotkeys, but at the end of the day is simple, elegant and well executed. As far as the options go, there aren't many. As to be expected from a game with this style you won't find anti-aliasing or post-processing sliders laying around, just SFX, music, resolution and mouse tidbits. There is unfortunately a complete lack of key rebinding, and I can't give anything in the way of controller support as I do not own one.\n\nExploration\n\nThe galaxy didn't at all give off the feel of exploring the vastness of space for me. Interstellaria trades off the commonly found procedural generation in space sims for hand crafted systems and worlds. Each system contains a single world along with one to three places you can land on and explore. There are, however, many random events one can come across, as well as the occasional baddie or three that will intercept you as you move through space. So while the random events and planets I could land on kept me interested, it was fairly short lived, as the galaxy just isn't all that vast or filled with a ton of content. Then again, it's a cheap game, I'm not expecting X series level of system detail and lore.\n\nShip & Crew Management\n\nVery similar to FTL. You have power units you can put into three categories; engines, stations and weapons. Crew need to eat, sleep and be entertained in order to be kept happy, but there are no major negative effects from not managing them well. The bonuses that you do get from keeping them happy are negligible, enough so that I essentially stopped caring about them sans armor, weapons and health 2 hours into the game and threw the extra power I used for those stations into my engines. From my view, more depth to crew management was a good idea but one very poorly executed, no mechanic should have so little presence that a player completely ignores it.\n\nEconomy\n\nPretty rigid and simple. Some items are worth more in one place, less in another, and that's as complex as it gets. You can't fill a demand with supply, nor can you cheat the market. I was able to make a few hundred thousand DY after finding a single profitable trade run less than an hour in, which ended up making the game fairly easy from an economical standpoint. I had no reason to collect or harvest minerals from planets or events, though I did need to kill some planetary creatures for armour.\n\nCombat\n\nThis is where the game's biggest fault lies. On planets, it can be buggy, aggravating and mundane. Pathing issues with the crew AI can lead to undesired results and they do not immediately respond when being attacked, if at all. In space, combat is reminiscent of shoot 'em up games but combined with FTL levels of space ship damage, repair and station management. Unfortunately, the projectiles travel so slowly that I was able to evade over 90% of any shots taken at me. Because of the profitable trade run I had, I was able to get a cruiser early on and completely stomp any encounter I ran across; because of ignoring crew management and boosting my engines, I was able to avoid almost every encounter. You’re technically allowed to have five ships in your fleet, but I only ever needed one.\n\nThis really took a toll on my enjoyment, and perhaps it's not quite the same for everyone else, I'm not exactly your average gamer, so I'm in the minority when it comes to finding gameplay challenging. But ignoring an audience simply because it's a minority isn't an excuse, especially because scalable difficulty isn’t some brand new concept, in fact, it's even more dated than the graphic style the game uses. A simple slider related to the speed of enemy projectiles in space combat would be all you need to make it more challenging.\n\nStory & Missions\n\nThe game includes a fairly enjoyable main plot that kept me interested enough to find out what was going on. It was unique and at time funny. As far as missions go, there are a few lying around here and there, but once you complete them that's it, there are no generated missions that you'd normally find in other space sims, just the main plot and a few side activities. Again though, Interstellaria is a hand-crafted experience for a cheap price, and the bits of text throughout the game make funny references to nerdy subcultures which is always a bonus in my book.\n\nGraphics\nMy favourite part of the game and very well done, fitting together seamlessly in the style the author chose to go for. Planets have their own unique biomes and looks, each race comes with an animated communications portrait and it's all very pixelated. If you enjoy retro, if you want to revel in a bit of nostalgia of an age past, this is definitely for you.\n\nAudio\nAnother enjoyable part of the game, catchy if a bit repetitive after long sessions. While not exactly the most beautiful tracks out there, each one fits well in every place it's used, so it gets a solid nod from me as a hobbyist composer.\n\nConclusion\nInterstellaria is an interesting and enjoyable experience that might not keep you entertained for years to come or blow your mind, but will definitely be fondly remembered in a day and age plagued by excessively rehashed formulas—a breath of fresh air worth every DY.\n\nIf there is anything I would say to the developer, should you read this Cold Rice, is that you need to make the game moddable. By the way assets are being stored, it seems like it would be easier than not and if you opened this up to the community, I guarantee you amazing things would happen.","July 20, 2015","true","21.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxamemnon/recommended/280360/","foxamemnon","Jetpack John","http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxamemnon/","487 products in account","I have just finished playing Interstellaria, and, to get straight to the point, it does much more right than it does wrong.  So, yes, it's a thumbs up and a game you should play if you enjoy this genre.\n\nComparisons with Star Control 2 are both unavoidable and probably not fair.  SC2, released oh so many years ago, still remains my favorite game of all time.  To expect another game to top that isn't fair.\n\nWith that out of the way, here is my pro/con list:\n\nPro:\n- Enjoyable pixel art style\n- Good soundtrack\n- Fun side-scrolling planet exploration\n- Decent trade mechanic\n- A nice variety of ships or varying styles and numerous weapons and components with which to customize them\n- Even though many of the details don't seem to matter much (see below), the game actually has a very nice crew management mechanic with skills, traits, inventory, and many types of armor and weapons\n\nCon:\n- Combat, both in space and on the surface, is much to simple\n- Except for speed, most stats don't seem to have any useful effect on gameplay\n- Random anomalies too hard to get to\n- Needs more: more stars, more planets, etc.\n\nI'll explain the cons a bit more:\n- Simple combat - In space, combat takes place in a small 2D window in the lower portion of the screen.  You target a ship and then spend your time clicking around to maneuver to avoid enemy fire.  The problem is, this is all you do.  Once you realize that ship speed is of paramount importance you just keep avoiding enemy fire until you've finally destroyed the enemies.\n\nDuring space combat you have the ability to control your crew, reassign their stations, have them make repairs, etc.  Unfortunately, in practice this is entirely unnecessary.  With the exception of your first few battles, when you are both underpowered and learning, if you ever get to the point of needing to repair your ship during combat then odds are your ship is already a lost cause.\n\nOn planet surfaces, you simply target an enemy and wait for your crew to kill them.  The only strategy is early on when you might need to make a quick return trip to your ship to rearm or heal.  All enemy encounters work pretty much the same way.\n\n- Speed and only speed - All you need is a fast ship.  Once you have that, you can then avoid or engage enemies at will (because you can always outrun them) on the starmap.  In combat, high speed makes it *far* easier to avoid enemy fire.\n\n- Space anomalies - Interstellaria actually has an interesting "anomaly" encounter feature.  If you're paying attention while travelling through space you will occasionally notice either a "special" asteroid or a space anomaly marker on the map.  These *do* add some nice random flavor to space travel, but for some reason they are *very* hard to intercept.  The problem seems to be that they are just too short lived; once you've seen one, clicked on it, and then travelled to it, too often you will find that it has already disappeared.  During my time playing the game I probably only made it to 20% of the anomalies I tried to explore.\n\n- More stars, more space - I think this is what could turn a good game into a great game.  The game's universe needs to be larger.  More stars and more planets would make the universe seem much more alive.  This is doubtless a big request and may be beyond the scope of what the devs want for their game.  It would probably require that the game be able to generate random planet surfaces, for example.  To make the unavoidable Star Control 2 comparison, SC2 had an *enormous* game universe.  Even though few of the planets were part of the game's story, just having all those stars and solar systems made you feel like you were exploring space and travelling through the immense void.\n\nThere's my two cents.  For $10 you really can't go wrong and there is more than enough enjoyment to be had.","October 7, 2015","true","31.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","4"

I'm normally not attracted to the 16 bit retro genre, except for Starbound,   but this game has kept me enthralled for much longer than I thought it would so I'm really glad I went against my initial distaste over its graphics because the gameplay it offers is quite deep.\n\nFrom an aethestics standpoint, I much prefer the 16 bit art of Starbound but even so, this game easily makes up for that in just how much there is to do.  The tutorial easily takes you from the very beginning so you can get used to the controls  and shortly thereafter, you are able to find a salvagable ship to begin your own journey as the ship's captain.  I have no idea how vast the universe is in this game but from what I've seen so far, there seems to be a huge amount of galaxies and planets to explore where you can scavange for anything of value, fight beasties or journey to friendly outposts to sell your goods and upgrade your ship and crew.\n\nWithout hesitation I can easily recommend this game to anyone who is a space sim fan because it sure helps scratch the itch for me, at least while I wait for Star Citizen to finish development but even when that happens, I think I'll still be playing this one because it's just so much fun, most likely because the lower end graphics allows  the developers to make it a very deep game.","July 18, 2015","true","28.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

The gameplay is original and conjures up feelings of all the old Sci-fi TV series. Exploring is definitely one of entertaining parts of the game, however, at the time of the review there was enough random planets or events outside the story to keep me entertained once the story had come to an end. Which leads me on to the story line- it’s an interesting story but very linear once its completed I found very little to keep me playing the game. I will keep an eye on this one as the developer is actively adding new content monthly.\n\nThere is room for improvement, there are still a couple of annoying bugs present such as getting around a plant called Uhu (I think) I spend a long time micromanaging my crew through a series of objects, did push me to point of frustration. Luckily this was my only truly bad experience as all the other bugs were a minor annoyance.\n\nOverall I really do recommend this game as I enjoyed the experience and kept me entertained.\n","September 8, 2015","true","28.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The plot as it stands seems pretty linear and there's a lot of waiting involved. Usually I'm fine with waiting a length of time for something to happen, this happens quite often in the old X games and EVE, and usually there is something you can occupy yourself with while you wait. However, Interstellaria has you sit and stare at your screen while you travel between star systems, with nothing going on for periods of up to three minutes. I find myself alt-tabbing a lot when traveling.\n\nThis game reminds me a lot of the old Void Wanderers mod for Cortex Command. As it stands I do quite enjoy this game for what it is right now, the space-combat can become a little tedious but I rather enjoy it. Moving around your ship components is also satisfying, but I would like to see more ship customization in the future.\n\nThis game has a lot of potential, and I would like to see it get improved (I'm sure it will at the rate the devs are going.)","July 26, 2015","true","1.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","2"

It borrows heavily from multiple games but the developer did an amazing job combining all the different genres  while also giving everything a unique twist and personality.  The games story and space combat remind me of EV Nova with some FTL energy/weapon/crew mechanics mixed in.  Ship combat is strategic with players commanding their individual ships on a 2D map directing movement paths and weapon targets.  While cruising between planets, the game reminds me of pixel piracy where you have to manage food, entertainment, and rest.  The ground combat also feels a bit like this as you can command a group of people to move/attack but don't actually have individual control over a single person as you would in a game like starbound/terraria.\n\nMusic is amazing and fitting to what is happening on screen.\n\nStory appears to be linear and the planets that you land on are not procedurally generated.\n\nThat being said, some of the random events that can take place can contribute to some amazing character development!  My captain was blasted by some form of alien light and had his chromosomes mixed up.  Soon after, while still coming to terms with her new identity, she was pelted with a high level dose of radiation and lost her hair (same with the other crew member at the time).  Donning a bird mask and alien armor, she forged ahead, slowly building her crew and ship into a small fleet with her weapons specialist (baldy) becoming her number 2.  But not all events turn out so well, she reflects back upon those that were lost and who she will lose next as she continues her journey to save mankind (as well as turn a quick profit).\n\nThis game has some good elements to it and will do remarkably well with a content patch later on to address some of the issues below.  Personally, I would love to see some procedurally generated content/worlds to explore!\n\nThe Good :\n-Pixel Art Style with equipable Armor/Clothing graphics on all the races.\n-Customizable ship interiors\n-Amazing game combat\n-Music\n-Character development via random events\n-Good planet designs, not terribly large but enough to have fun with.\n-Witty humor\n\nThe Bad:\n-Crew path finding can sometimes go full stupid as they get stuck in a loop of trying to make a jump only to hurl themselves off a cliff or just completely forget what it is they were doing and stand there.\n\n-UI can be a tad clunky.  Hotkeys and button placements try, but don't feel streamlined.  Really needs a "combat stations" button that will reassign all crew members and energies to a player saved setting.\n\n-Pausing the game in space combat does not stop asteroids from moving, just the ships/projectiles.\n\n-Each faction only has a handful of ships to play with.\n\n-Nothing is explained!  What does this symbol on your armor mean?  How does armor work?  What are the basic mechanics/principles for individual crew inventory?  How do you use ship armor plates to repair?\n\nThe Ugly:\n-Resource gathering takes FOREVER!  Launching a ship back out to space, watching the 7 second animation liftoff, moving a single item into the appropriate inventory, and finally re-landing the ship all to sell a stupid 20mm gun that you picked up in a fight is TEDIOUS!  Everything in this game eats away at your precious time in small 1-7 second intervals!\n\n-Item inventory can also get a tad ugly, especially when trying to fit out ships in your fleet and you can't tell if the engineering stations in your fleet inventory is better or worse then what you have currently equipped to a fighter you never directly fly with.  This stems from the clunky UI design, but it doesn't become terrible until this point.\n\n-I found an asteroid where I wasn't able to leave from!  My captain was at the bottom of a cliff that I couldn't get back up from.  Luckily the game auto-saved prior to me landing on that rock.\n","July 18, 2015","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/angryjedi/recommended/280360/","angryjedi","Amarysse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/angryjedi/","481 products in account","This is a really cool game. It's a little rough around the edges at the moment -- there's a few bugs here and there, particularly with regard to camera control and keyboard responsiveness -- but its potential and charm shine through.\n\nThe most exciting thing about this game is that it's the first game I've played for YEARS that feels like a successor to classic space exploration games like Star Control II and Starflight. It doesn't rely on procedural generation to try and be interesting -- procedurally generated worlds often end up being dull, anyway -- and instead provides an interesting, vaguely Mass Effect-esque plot regarding mysterious "Abductors" to follow as you explore the galaxy in your relic of a starship, harvesting resources from planets and attempting to make your fortune.\n\nThere's a nice blend between FTL-style crew management in space and vaguely RTS-esque gameplay for away missions. The crew AI is a little flaky -- at times they'll think to satisfy their own food/sleep/fun needs for themselves, while others they'll stand staring blankly at a wall when the fridge/stasis tube/jukebox is right next to them -- and pathfinding is occasionally completely broken, with crewmembers getting into "loops" where they fail to make a jump and repeatedly fall down the same pit over and over again, but big picture: these issues don't detract from an overall satisfying experience, and hopefully the developers will fix them in the long term.\n\nOne thing I will say, and this is just a matter of personal taste: the humour in this game is entertaining and fun, but I'm actually quite hungry for a game of this ilk that takes itself just a little more seriously. That doesn't mean that there can't be humour -- the Star Trek TV shows struck a good balance between humour and drama, for example -- but I feel the experience in this game may well have been more compelling and immersive if crew members didn't wander around saying things like "poop" and "welp" and having names like Ugly Nostrils. Again, this doesn't detract from the overall experience (and, in a feature that makes me very happy indeed, you can rename all your crew members) but it's just a point of taste I wanted to raise.\n\nOverall, then, this is well worth a punt if you're a fan of the classic space exploration games I mentioned earlier.","July 18, 2015","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like others have mentioned the game its self is "simple" but has depth and complexity in the choices you make. Someone said this game is a bit like if FTL and Terraria had a baby, and I find that to be very true. While I recommend the game for various reasons (mostly because I like FTL style games) there are some pain points to be aware of before buying.\n\nSince my feelings about the game are mostly positive, here are the bad things first:\n- It's buggy. I came across a flower that could not be harvested. I've had squad mates continually try (and fail) to jump to ledges getting "stuck".  Tiles are not seamless and there are graphical bugs from the way the tiles stretch on my monitor (mostly in the form of green lines where there should be black)\n- The UI is HORRIBLE. Like, I haven't seen a UI this bad since pixel piracy. There aren't enough keyboard shortcuts to be useful, and the whole thing is just very clunky. It's not game breaking, but it's bad, almost frustrating.\n- Pathfinding is HORRIBLE, like, really bad. Especially in the vertical maps.\n- Land based combat is buggy and ugly to look at. Sometimes you have to reclick an enemy. The animations are ugly.\n- Space based combat requires micromanaging your ship(s) movement\n- Resource collection is a chore. Planet side maps follow a formula: Scout out and kill all the enemies, then sit there and twiddle your thumbs for 5-10 minutes while your crew harvests.\n\nThe good.\n- Good assortment of weapons, load outs, and configurations for your ships.\n- Light crew management (sleep, food, entertainment) that offers an additional challenge without getting in the way\n- Two types of combat (land and space) keep things varied\n- A story that plays second to exploration and roleplaying\n- Roguelike death elements that keep you on your toes, danger is real\n- Surprising amount of dialog and mini quests\n\nSummary: If FTL and terraria had a baby, this would be it.\n\nI give it a 7/10.\n\nGraphics meh, sound meh. gameplay good.","July 18, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is a main story threaded through, but it never distracts you from the fact that you're doing precisely the same actions every time. Waiting for your crew to loot an entire map is one thing, but travelling via the starmap is agonisingly dull; three actual minutes to reach another star, with nothing happening, is ludicruous.\n\nUltimately, it could have been great but is an exercise in boredom.

They have fixed bugs I never knew existed and never encountered. All the problems I pointed out remain, with the exception of having to double-click the time forward key instead of hitting it once.\n\nBugs, UI weirdness, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat system, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ inventory system, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ crew/fleet management system.\n\nIt's fun, but I'd wait 'til they iron out the massive amounts of bugs. The UI is spaced so that if you try to click the time accelerate button you pan right and drag a box instead of clicking the button, Combat is already very bad and it gets weird when sped up. The UI placement could be forgiveable if the hotkey for the button was actually responsive, I basically have to double tap f every time. Combine that with the very strange unintuitive inventory system and you can find you're having a bit more trouble learning the game than you should. The ship repair window, specifically, seems to be cut off in the top left.\n\nThe important part: This game advertises itself as a sort of rts or turn-based strategy game, having the ability to pause to issue orders to a fleet of ships each with their own crews. Now, 90% of the time when I issued orders while paused they just stood around when unpaused, so yeah....\nThe reality: There's no way to tell who has what amount of health once you control more than one person. The health bar is displayed under the characters and in the top left corner, but only one will appear in the corner at a time, leaving you to guess how much health the other characters you've selected have.\n\nThis game is set up so weird that the guy who joins your crew in the tutorial deserted on me before I finished the tutorial because I wasn't meeting his needs (food, sleep, etc.) at a point in the game where I was literally unable to do so.\n\nExploring is ok, standard fog of war for terrain you haven't seen, resources to gather, blah blah. There's a harvest mode where the NPC selected automatically gathers resources with seemingly no rhyme or reason to the order. Your crew will walk all the way to the left end of the map which is always not far to gather some vines (there is no crafting system I'm aware of) and then have to walk back to the ship to drop off the single unit of vine because that's how this inventory system works, and then walk all the way to the right to mine some gems which are actually not useless like the ♥♥♥♥ing vines. Now, if an NPC in harvest mode comes across an enemy and gets into combat, there's no guarantee your crewmember will fight back, or even that the bat that slapped it in the face will even remember why he initiated combat in the first place. His little crewmember buddies also set to harvest mode will walk right past him fighting that giant dinosaur monster because priorities and that flower looks really useful. Every now and then, while trying to get to a resource or back to the ship, they will encounter a locked door they'll rub their faces against indefinitely or a jump that for some reason they just can't make even though it's the only way back and is literally the smallest possible size for a gap.\n\nNow, the last bit because after this happened I ragequit: Once I had amassed enough cash and crew for a second ship, I bought a small fighter, put my second in command in it with a nice big gun, and watched as a pirate with machine guns tore him to pieces because the ship I had just bought didn't have a steering wheel. When you buy a vehicle, do they usually include the means to move said vehicle?\n\nSorry this is so unorganized, but I just got done playing and the only thought I can console myself with is that it was only $10. Too bad it took me more than 4 hours to decide it's not worth the $10, no refund for me.","July 18, 2015","false","5.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadbabieswz/recommended/280360/","deadbabieswz","Count Dracula","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadbabieswz/","177 products in account","As previous reviewers have mentioned, there is a significant difference between Interstellaria's advertising, and what you actually get once you get in-game. I have spent approximately 18 hours playing this game as of the time writing this review, so I feel that my experiences with it have come to encompass a lot of what the game has to offer.\n\nThis is a disappointingly linear game. Unlike what the advertising may have you believe, you are bound to a static map and an incredibly linear storyline. The random elements extend to only your crew members that you start with, drops, and space events which occur as you travel across the Starmap. There are also random events that pop up when you land on planets, but these are trivial and I have never seen a single event yield any kind of noteworthy dividends.\n\nThe main plot suggests that you are a member of the Interstellar Trade Co. With this in mind, I found it incredibly confusing how little actual trading there is to do in the game. Unlike other games which actually do have organic space economies (I'm looking at you, Starsector), Interstellaria literally has a -small- handfull of stations that will pay slightly more for bogus commodities which after the first 15 minutes of gameplay are no longer even cost effective to collect and sell vs the superior option of farming ship modules in space battles.\n\nI actually haven't found the buggyness of the game to be that bad during my time playing it. Don't get me wrong - bugs do exist just about everywhere. The worst one I experienced was being teleported 40 feet into the ground when I attempted to disembark my crew from my ship. I've also noticed strange FPS drops when having multiple characters firing Needler rifles at the same time. None of these have actually done too much damage to my ability to sink time into the game. Also, the developer appears to be addressing these issues as they arise pretty dilligently. I think that is worth some consideration given how many people are complaining about this point.\n\nAnother area of disappointment for me is the lack of significant character development. There are random events that can occur (mostly when running into space anomalies on the starmap) which can give your characters interesting conditions/perks/disabilities. But these are mostly trivial and I never felt like any of these events were even noteworthy occurences in my playthrough. There is an augmentations system which lets you do permenantly enhance characters with things like shields and alien powers. This was my favorite part of the game in terms of character progression. But there's just not enough of it to keep me engaged. You seem to stumble across Augmentations by visiting planets with pre-scripted Augmentation yielding dialogue trees. I've never had an augmentation come from a random loot drop. Furthermore, character stats appear to only affect their ability to interact with the ship while it's in space. This is an issue since about 50% of the game is spent running around planetside. The only way to modify your characters is through their gear, and you will max your gear out within 3 hours of playing. This can be done in even less time if you know which planets to go to for farming.\n\nThe map may appear somewhat large. But it's actually quite small since a solid 40-50% of the planets on the map are non-embarkable. They're just there as filler. The planets you can go to are usually very small, and have small side areas which only open up through dialogue trees and the acquisition of new items. If you are excited for the prospect of exploring, go find another game because this one simply won't scratch the itch. Also, there is nothing procedural about this game for those of you who I see asking whether or not it is.\n\nIn summary\nPRO\n+Very, very cool artstyle.\n+Great music and sound design\n+Ship landings feel very cinematic and are consistently fun to watch\n+Still fun despite numerous problems\n+Reasonably priced\n+Still has a lot of potential depending on what the dev plans on doing from here onwards\n\nCON\n+Extremely linear\n+Not much content\n+Buggy at the time of release (Subject to change, though)\n+Most decisions are trivial\n+Very little character progression\n+The only way to accomplish anything in a reasonable amount of time is by engaging in very gamey grinding\n+You will burn through 100% of the content this game has to offer very quickly\n+Almost zero replayability\n+Nothing procedural anywhere to encourage replay value\n+Most of the map is filler, with only about 50% of the planets being embarkable","July 19, 2015","false","17.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

I can't believe this flew under my radar all the way until it was released. Every time I find myself going "I wish <x> feature was in", I end up finding it five minutes later. The ship combat feels sort of like upgraded FTL, as does the fleet and crew mechanics. Then there's sections where you can run around on planets and stations. The game is roughly 50/50 ship and ground combat, and both sections feel engaging and unique.","July 18, 2015","true","13.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you don't like pixel art, this game probably won't change your mind. There are portions that aren't as pixelated as most of the trailer, for instance the parallax. The GUI itself is fairly unique. The next update may end that.\n\nThe music is very good. It changes when you enter a battle and when you win the battle. The sound effects may not please everyone, but their volume can be adjusted seperately from the music volume.\n\nThere are aproximently three forms of content.\n1. Planets. Most of the landable planets are employed in the story line. They offer enemies to fight, random loot drops (weapons and armor are specific to the planet), and resources to harvest.\n2. Fleet. You can have up to five ships at one time. Each ship has is its own stations, weapons, and crew. There are quite a few customization options. You have 20 playable ships, 11 playable races (5 are standard, 1 resembles Wookies, 4 are robotic, and 1 consists of two dogs), 12+ interchangeable armor sets, 25+ crew weapons, 20 ship weapons, and the ability to rename ships and crew. That's not even counting the Augments scattered around the hiding spots of the galaxy.\n3. Anomalies. These come in three varieties. The first two types appear on the starmap and require you to fly to them. Special Asteroids offer a few valuable resources, and Unknown Anomalies offer all kinds of things. The third type of anomaly occurs when you land on a planet (but not on every landing). It usually gives you the chance to take a risk or leave something alone.\n\nAfter saying all that, there are cons. For instance, there are a few bugs and more typos. If you don't go looking for all the content, you may get bored very quickly. There are periods when you may wish the fast forward button was faster, or available for space travel. There really isn't any fast paced action (you always have recourse to the pause button from any action screen). Crew sometimes require a bit of help to path certain areas.\n\nOverall, you want this game if you're looking for a casual game that offers stuff to explore, some light combat, and the ability to make lots of money from discovering the best trade routes. If you're looking for fast paced combat or a huge universe, you will probably be disappointed.

I just finished it a couple days ago and am still a little bit sore about it.\n\nThe most outstanding parts of the game are the soundtrack and its aesthetics. If you can accept this kind of retro style, you are in for a treat. Period.\n\nWhile I myself don't think there is anything particularly bad about the game, there sure are some mediocrities about it:\n-The story feels drawn out. It's not bad, although the dialogs telling most of it could be improved quite a bit; dialogs are short, non-branching and often times simple. I can only remember a single occurence where I could make a true choice, although the outcome didn't matter too much.\n\n-The universe is small and absolutely static. Trading thus becomes a sure bet. Luckily trading is not necessary all that much, otherwise this would become very tedious.\n\n-There aren't too many ships, weapons etc. In general the game feels a little bit short on content. That and the slightly drawn-out story don't mix too well.\n\n-Both kinds of fights feel as if their balancing could use more work; maybe the mechanics could even use a complete overhaul. Fighting on the ground becomes tedious over time, mainly due to the limited ammunition of your weapons. At first I really liked what I saw, but the combat never got too much depth to it.\nSpace battles seem a lot better and stayed fun throughout the game. Although I think that the whole idea of having a fleet (i.e. more than one ship) is undermined by the fact that controlling more than one ship drastically slows down the speed at which you can finish fights. At the same time there isn't too much benefit in having more than one ship.\n\nConclusion: Content is a bit short (except for story-wise), a couple of minor bugs still need to be fixed, the game is extremely linear, some of the mechanics seem rough around the edges and the UI comes along with some most-likely unwanted "oldschool traits" as well (i.e. sometimes it sucks). Nevertheless the game is certainly worth its price - maybe watch a video beforehand and don't hesitate to buy the game if you like what you see. At all.\n\nI do hope that there will be some kind of expansion or dlc since the foundation of the game is very promising. More content and at least a polishing pass on the mechanics could make this game truly great.","July 22, 2015","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I backed it on Kickstarter, and have eagerly awaited its release ever since. I was extremely, extremely excited when it became available last Friday! I've played the game several hours already, and I will continue to pour more time into it. There are many similarities between Interstellaria and FTL, of course, but it was nice to play a game with a different perspective on that formula. The ability to have a fleet, to exploring planets, and to really manage a crew and customize the layout of my ship appeals to me.\n\nThe story is fairly linear, but I know I've certainly gone "off course" quite a bit and have enjoyed it. No, it's not like there are these huge subquests to find or something along those lines, but you aren't wholly confined to do only one thing at a time. Flying around looking for encounters to destroy ships and mine asteroids to get more cash is an enjoyable little break from following any linear path.\n\nI would love to see updates and expansions for the game in future, as I'm sure everyone would. But when I look at Interstellaria there's one thing that strikes me the most: this is someone's work. Coldrice has put a huge, huge amount of personal effort into making the game a reality, and that's something beautiful and incredible. Is it perfect? Of course not - nothing is. But is all of the time, effort, sweat, tears, emotions, struggles, and pure heart Coldrice poured into this thing to make it a reality worth $9.99? I think anyone knows the answer: it's worth much more than just that. Give it a go!","July 21, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are also a lot of bugs that plague the game, though I expect this will get better over time and none of the ones I've encountered yet have been game-breaking.\n\nShip combat is rather easy, but satisfying enough.  Character combat is a bit boring - click your guy, click the thing you want him to attack, and then hope for the best.\n\nThe story, so far, is interesting enough, though again it's marred by a rather poor interface.

So, yeah... I belive the dev's wll patch the bags soon and add more content bit by bit, as it happening with terraria. The game itself is complete, but couple of new things wouldn't hurt. (May contain couple of spoilers) For example, I'd like to see...\n\n-More ships and items. It could be a little knowns races ships, like these kangooro-dogs-thingies, spacers-ciborgs, ninja-turtle guy... Or kind of unique ships, like the bountyhunter one. Experimental prototypes or stranded aliens from uncharted sectors. And as for now, there isn't that much choise of clothes for your crew and weapons to defend yourself. There are pretty much droppable randomly from enemies and if you want to make a set of armor/weapons for your crew, you are going to need to grind it hard, untill you get enough of these items. It would be nice for each race to just sell some kind of their traditional equipment in stores instead, like the armor-weapon set that you can purchase on Trade Co. Well... That kind of things, because this game offers you the ability to have a fleet of different ships, speaking of which...\n\n-Sub-captain. It would be nice if you could assign a sub-captain, separate his ship from fleer and be able to control 2-3 expedition ships besides your main one with sub-captains. Let's say, you are a trader mostly, right? Having a fleet is a good idea, to protect your cargo from pirates and such, but having several ships in different points of the map would help you a lot to expand your commerce. And speaking of commerce...\n\n-More stations/personal station. We could use more variaty in station. Yeah, space in your ship is kind of limited, but that's the whole point, you need to manage it however you can and according to your needs. Like, a cloacking station that could turn your ship invisible for a while, shield station, bathroom and janitors, to clean your ship after you crew leaves a mess if there is no bathroom on board. Maybe, some decorative thingies in your ship to cheer your crew up a bit and also... Maybe it's just me, but I'd like to have a personal station to manage. Like, make it ridiculously expensive and you could set it on any planets with no landing sites. Like, pay your taxes to the faction that owns that territory, install some trade-posts, a bar and stuff like that for travelers, add some random quests and events from them and it's going to be way more fun. And speaking of which...\n\n-This game could use some more side quests, like that hermit on desert planet who doesn't want to speak to you. What is that guy deal? He have no purpouse in there, but if there was some sort of a side quests with that guy, that would be fun. And random events, some may go one or another way and some events only have one outcome. Like, the toxic-sludge guy, who will always die if you try to pick him up. Tried it about 6 times, he always dies. Or habitated asteroid event, have the same outcome as well. Because once you explored the map and completed the main quest, there is not much left to do. Speaking of which...\n\n-It would be nice if the map expanded after completing the main story, unlocking new locations to visit, side quests, etc. Or maybe some of the empty planets could be populated by your crew and you could build a village of some sort, or as I mentioned before, space station. Because, after all, you'll get 100k credits at the end of the game and there is not much point of having that kind of money in first place if there is nothing to do after your finished the main quest and it's kind of a bummer. Yeah, you are a hero, you saved everyone and all that, but what's not? There is nothing else to do left. So, yeah... Adding some more features after the end of main story would be nice too.\n\nTL/DR: The game is great, but for now it feels kind of incomplete and I think that it could use more features in order to make your playing experience more enjoyable, because as for now, there isn't much to do after you complete de main quest, it's pretty much the game's end and that's all, there is nothing left to do anymore. So, I give this game a 7/10, I had a lot of fun playing it and in my personal opinion, it has plenty of potencial.","August 5, 2015","true","55.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's also *the* most actively supported game I've *ever* bought; every day there's a new patch/fix to improve gameplay, brought into effect from user feedback.\n\nThere is a story to follow, but it's also a sandbox, so you can do pretty much anything you want. Gameplay is actually really good, and once I start playing it *keeps me hooked*.

Well:\n\n1. I find the inventory a little clunky to find my way around. I like the idea of an "away team inventory" and a "fleet inventory", but I find myself taking off and landing repeatedly to sort between them when selling the sweet loot I've aquired from various battles and away missions.\n\n2. Anomalies show up, I fly to them, then they disappear *just* when I reach them, or I get intercepted by a hostile fleet, and by the time I've dealt with them they've gone. This makes me sad.\n\n3. Your crew can stack up to four augments, which is frikkin awesome, but why not ships too? You can customise the ships in their onboard systems, weapon loadout and power distribution, but having the augment system for them would just add a sweet little level of customisation that would only make me like the game more.\n\nHowever, between the time of me beginning to write this, and me pressing "Post review", a patch may have been released that addresses at least two out of three of them...","July 20, 2015","true","25.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skyeyemachine/recommended/280360/","skyeyemachine","skyeye.machine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skyeyemachine/","112 products in account","All in all, I enjoyed this game.  In some ways it's a neat throwback to Star Control 2, and also an interesting nod to more recent titles such as FTL.  I also respect that it's a solo effort by a single developer, and I enjoy the sense of personality that the game frequently shows in its' dialogue and encounters.  A few in particular were quite funny.  The artwork is pretty charming, and I enjoyed flying through space, customizing my ship, dogfighting other ships, and trundling around on planets.  The soundtrack, composed by Chipzel, also felt very fitting and enjoyable, and the sound design as a whole worked very well.\n\n(There have been a number of launch bugs, but the developer has already released a number of patches addressing these issues as they come in, so I currently consider that a problem which is being effectively addressed.)\n\nHowever, the game also has some significant weaknesses; the primary ones being that it is a pretty short game in terms of the main quest, and that there's currently not really enough world content to justify much replay value after my first playthrough.  Minus what I presume is a small handfull of lingering encounters, I have visited every planet, and found what seems to be the majority of side-quest content the game seems to have on offer.  I also feel that, while I enjoyed the combat system, there could have been better opponent AI and more challenging encounters, especially late game.  I went into the final encounter with a single top-of-the-line ship and a heavy weapon loadout, and basically won without any real trouble.  Some really tough encounters with "the abductors" would have been a neat possibility, for instance.  Basically, by the time I'd reached the end, and obtained my reward, there frankly wasn't a whole lot left to use it for that I'd not already done. =P\n\nAs well, the interface, while atmospheric in some ways, can get pretty clumsy, even frustrating, to use at times.  The inventory interface in particular is a notable example of this; the division between "fleet" and "away team" item storage could have been handled a lot more cleanly.  I feel that the UI as a whole could use a significant refactoring to improve usability, and would suggest the developer look into this.  Combat and exploration on planets could also be a more elaborate experience, although I don't have any large complaints in this category.  Most of the planet encounters can basically be summarized as "simple, but fine".  I definitely feel like the planets cound have generally been larger, and had more vertical exploration, though.  Some proceedural generation of worlds could have potentially added a lot of content to the game.\n\nFinally, while I found the core storyline to have a pretty neat twist to it near the end, I have to say that I found the chain of quests leading up to the endgame to be a bit arbitrary.  The links tying the different races/characters together in your quest for answers just didn't feel very cohesive; for instance, I'm still not sure I get how the Anoa and Kushin were supposedly involved in the main quest conflict.  It's a story I want to like, but which doesn't manage to tie events together cleanly in the way it seems to be attempting, especially in the middle segments prior to seeking out Brand (I will refrain from saying too much more because spoilers).  More ship and planet dialogue in general would also have helped.  I have to say that Star Control 2 is still a shining example of storytelling in this genre, and while I feel that Interstellaria does not necessarily need to do the same things, or apply them to the same level, it could definitely still take some big pointers from that forerunner in this category.\n\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\n\nI have mixed feelings.  Fundamentally, I do like the game, and if the developer adds more content, and cleans up some of its' current weaknesses/issues, I think it could grow to become a very fun trade-combat-exploration sandbox.  As it is, if you like FTL and Star Control 2, and are looking for something on the lighter, shorter side, this may be a good choice for you.  I'd currently describe it as a great coffee break game.  On these fronts, I have decided to recommend it, as I like where it's coming from and am hopeful for where it's going.\n\nThat said, I am still fundamentally left with the feeling that this game is hurting for a lack of content, has some important design issues that need to be addressed, and could generally use a lot of polish in certain places.  Perhaps the game could also do better at embracing some of its' roguelike-esque elements, too; space (and the items/people you find in it) could be a much more varied and challenging place than it currently is, with more mysteries than it currently has.  (Again, some well-engineered proceedural generation could be a big boon to this game.  Maybe even something like multiplayer/LAN ship battles could be fun, so players could pit their fleets against each other, as a more ambitious recommendation.)  If the developer can deliver on these fronts, I feel that Interstellaria could become a lot better than it currently is.\n\nAs things stand, Star Control 2 does its' story and exploration a lot better, and FTL has tighter combat and encounter mechanics; so if you're seeking either of those, I have to say they'd be stronger recommendations, with Interstellaria sitting a bit awkwardly in-between.  So, in the end, consider this a cautionary recommendation.","July 20, 2015","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just enough sci-fi tropes. Good light-hearted humour.\n- Space combat is fun enough.\n\nWhat could be better:\n- Control in away missions feels cumbersome. Your red shirts crewmen will suffer just because of poor pathfinding. So if you want your precious tactical officer to survive, micromanage.\n- Inventory UI. It feels so "retro", but, in fact, it just seems not quite thought-out. Freet inventory / away missions inventory takes quite a while to get used to, and even after that involves extra pointless clicking. No real game decisions, just dragging objects from your fleet to the trade post and back. Limited number of inventory slots doesn't really play a big role in the game (there are not so many items lying around, anyway), so why bother?\n- Flying from point A to point B could use fast-forward with some kind of smart pause.\n- Once you secure the area in "away mision", "harvesting" is just sitting back and waiting (and hoping your crewmen would not run into some toxic lake).\n- Plot feels very linear and guided.\n- Not really much content to explore.","July 18, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is essentially building empire mixed with a farming game. Your main goal is to collect money to become more powerful via ships or equipment for crew. This lets you progress. Here's the issue, it's not always fun. Ship combat is very fun and high stakes, as one wrong move can mean ten-thousand credits down the drain. Man to man isnt. If you have a better gun and armor, you win. There's not a real battle, especially since you can head back to the ship and heal once you get the medi-station. You just eliminate enemies, by clicking and fast-forwarding until it's done, and then tell everyone to farm the planet. Now that the bad issue is out, lets talk about good. The game has the charm of a nice space game, kinda giving a more exploration based FTL feel (Reccomend that game waaay more though) and keeps you interested. There is actually a story besides "You are captain, explore" and it matches goofy with a slight tinge of sad to make a very good feel. So, in conclusion, buy this game, but don't be ashamed to ask for a refund if the game is not for you.","December 23, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
