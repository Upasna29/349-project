"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198170939250/recommended/327380/","76561198170939250","Strategydojo","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198170939250/","688 products in account","This Review has some CRITICAL information missing from the home page to enable you to play through with out loosing all your gold/guns to a security check.\n\nThis game is a literal port of the late 80's version of the game.\n\nCRITICAL PIRACY CHECK INFORMATION YOU NEED TO KNOW.\nThis game was designed with a anti-piracy feature (I know ironically funny) where each page of the instruction manual had a pirates flag on it with a real pirates name. During the game you sometimes come across a pirate and it asks you to identify the flag. If you choose incorrectly you will loose all your gold, all your cannons, and your crew will be very very unhappy.\n\nUse this link to match the right flag during the... Anti-piracy check... In Pirates the game.\nhttp://www.goodolddays.net/file/file,89/id,229/type,docs/\n\nSaving: To save the game you must be in a town (not at sea) and go to your cabin. The dresser on the right has a chalk board and you click on this to save. Just because most don't have the manual, I wanted to stress you had to be in a town to do this.\n\nThis was one of my go to games in the early 90s and I played around with it A LOT more than most of my other games.\n\nIt is dated, and the newer version is probably a better game if you don't have a connection to the old game. But for me just seeing the MPS Lab logo during boot up took me back in a time machine. The music and lay out has such a nostalgically fulfilling aspect to it.\n\nThings I like about this game compared to the new nicer looking version\n-You can marry the Merchents daughter (which actually leads to an advantage if you want to be a merchant more than a pirate)\n\n-You can "Spend a pleasent evening" with the bar maid and build up a spy newwork of lovers\n\n-Does not have dancing (Which is fun the first time you do it, but becomes repetitive and boring and slows down the new version)\n\n-You can select the time periods that you want to play in and the world map is geared historically to a balance of power of those years\n\nTIPS\nSword Combat: I see a lot of people feel that sword fighting is random, and battles are random. Since I was a kid I learned that if you took the Big Cutlas sword and just button mashed over their head you would win 98% of battles even when outnumbered 3 to 1. The cutlas is broken and use it to have your 50 guys win a victory vs 200-300 groups.\n\nKilling off crew:\nBefore breaking up pirating session and regrouping I found killing off the majority of my crew had a long term perk. Sure I did not get more shares because you get a % of the total based on your difficulty setting but the rest of the crew do get more and the amount they get plays into how they feel about a campaign and impacts your repulation and future recruiting efforts. So I would have several hundred men to go hunt with and then when I was done I would attack a spanish town and kill off all but 50ish of them. They would be happy when dividing the plunder and my reputation would grow.\n\nDifficulty Setting\nStarting on the highest difficult can be really challanging (which can be fun), but if you want a path to success have your first few campaigns as a apprentice and build up a ship and reulation when it is easy. Then you can advance in your difficulty to the next level when you have a good ship and reputation to get a good crew easily at the higher difficulty.\n\nWhen in bad shape don't investigate ships\nIf you find you are having a problem and don't want to risk being attacked by another pirate (crew low, or ship damaged), when you spot a ship on the horizon you don't have to investigate. This will keep you safe as you try to make it back to port when you are in a vulnerable shape.\n\nTown Interaction before Dividing Plunder\nwhen you go to a town you can see the Gov and recuit crew. If you do this and then divide the plunder, months will click off and when you start your next outing it will still have it checked off that you talked to the GOV (or got crew) and not let you do it again until you leave town and come back. The Gov can update you on who is at war with who, so it is good to know not to see him before dividing plunder.\n\nMerchant King:\nAs you buy and sell material the economy (available gold and goods) at a merchent in that town shifts. The more you trade the more a town prospers and the amount of goods and prices are impacted. If you marry a merchants daughter you get items at a huge discount. You get a even better deal if you pick the Chrismatic Smooth talker trait at the begining (rose icon among traits).\n\nI once did an experiment, and I played one year as a pirate and got land and grew my title. The next outing I went and raided a bunch of spanish ships and got my fleet up, but had all but a skeleton crew on each ship (killed my men off in a controlled battle). I married the merchant daughter of a well off island to the east that was close to several other establishments. I then bought low, sailed a couple days and made 50%+ profit each trip. I broke the gold counter and maxed everything out. I forget if 99,999 was the max amount of 999,999... something like that. With that much gold and  having the Chrismatic trait I was also able to continue my voyage for every. My personal log maxed out at 99 years (I guess they never thought some one would figure out how to be 100 year old pirate and still be active).  It is fun to be a pirate Merchant King. You can max out gold and age.\n\nSo there you have it. Should you get this game? If you have a connection to the original the answer is YES it plays just like you remember and this version on steam is really solid. If you are fascinated by gaming history and like seeing how games evolved and you like the current version of Sid Myer's pirates then this is fun to see how it was done 25+ years ago.\n\nI would buy on sale, and realize it is a game of the late 80s-early 90s. As you can tell from my review this game means a lot to me. It is part of my childhood, and was one of the first games that I looked at how it was made and found a way to "break" it with my merchant king approach which was a fun experience for me and before the days of the internet where you could look up ways to really get ahead in a game. This game is in my top 100 games of all time. It allowed a 10 year old me to be a pirate and rule the seas. I glady give them the price of a Starbuck coffee to revist that part of me and go be a playboy with all the Barmaids.\n\nIf you want a Pirate sim that lets you upgrade your ship, build specialty crew members, have tactics with different cannon shots for combat, has cute graphics for combat, and a better story focus for finding your lost family then I say get the newer version.\n\nIf you want to see what it was like to be a kid playing the best pirate game out in the late 80s/early 90s, then look no further to a game that lets you experince that.\n\nIf you have any questions about something just leave a comment. I love this game and will respond and help my fellow swashbucklers (or merchant Kings)","April 6, 2015","true","284.7"," 204 of 205 people (100%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","100","204","205","8","9"

Gold	1993\n\nHonestly I bought this on sale, and for the price I paid for it was okay.  At the normal price Id be a little less likely.\nSince for a couple bucks more you can get the 2004 version.(which I already own)\n\nIf your looking for HD Graphics and a great storyline sadly you are looking in the wrong place.  This game has aged ...... alot\n\nI bought this game because it was something I played when I was growing up, and for its day it was a great game compared to its competition.  If you are feeling nostalgic or are into retro games this is the game for you.\n\nIts is the closest thing to a retro experience you will have short of pulling your old Tandy or 486 out of the closet.\n\nSo If you are a hardcore Uber retro Fanboy's and want to prove it buy it at full price. (Though I doubt Sid Meier or any of the people who originally developed this game get much out of this)\n\nEven if you want to wait till this game is on sale,  Id still reccomend it if you are into retro games.","December 13, 2014","true","0.1"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","37","42","3","0"
