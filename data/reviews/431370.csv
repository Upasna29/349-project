The graphics /audio are done really well and I love the use of a diorama as a story telling device in VR. Not sure I would necessarily justify the price compared to other VR games, but overall a very polished experience. Here is a video review I did of a small part of the experience: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGSQ5pHcXSs","April 27","true","2.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can't interact with some of the objects around you and others you can, but I can't tell what the point of any of that interaction is. It is fairly inexpensive, so there's not much risk in getting it but there's so many other compelling VR experiences out there now that this one doesn't bring anything new to the table.","April 9","false","0.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

It's not fun, interesting or anything really. Hardly worth 1â‚¬, let alone 5.","May 15","false","0.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Ghost cars are kinda cool.\n\nWhen I went thru the door one time I steped on the AC vent just as I stepped out into the rain! Extra immersive!","May 13","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
