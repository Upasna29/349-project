"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rugeplus/recommended/216260/","rugeplus","Ruge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rugeplus/","375 products in account","It's rare to find a decent Cricket game since the mid-90s to mid-2000s. During this time it was a battle of two publishers: Electronic Arts and Codemasters. Early iterations of the game were fun and lacked the realism that most sports games demand. If you're considering DBC 14 I also recommend searching for EA's Cricket 96 (PC) or Codemaster's Shane Warne Cricket 99 (PS1) on eBay.\n\nBut back to more current matters. DBC 14 is by far the most authentic cricket game since the EA Sports release of Cricket 2005 for the PC and PS2. Running the game for the first time, you are met with an update that thankfully changes all player names to real names. I hope to see an update in the future that contains real stadium names too. Once in the game, you have various game options from 5-over a side to full blown test cricket. You can also create yourself and move up the ranks of world cricket.\n\nThe practice arena is great too, reminiscent of a training nets session. From time to time I find myself relaxing in the nets just having a hit. I've only accumulated a few hours on the PC version but I did so, migrating from the XBOX 360 version. DBC 14 has a solid frame rate and feels very smooth. One aspect that still needs improving is the commentary. While not bad, it's not great. It's certainly not as annoying as other sports games (like PES) but not as smooth or free flowing.\n\nI love the camera angles in this game. When playing solo, you are shown your player from the 3rd person perspective. While this is standard fare for bowling in all cricket games, it's quite refreshing for batting and makes the game feel more authentic. Fielding is decent too and the camera angles during play are superb.\n\nAt the time of writing this, I'm in search for games during the Steam sale. However I was quite willing to drop the full price for this game for two reasons: Supporting not just a local developer, but one that is willing to put the time and effort to capture a sport that itself has captured millions around the world.","December 25, 2014","true","21.6"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","0"

Not only am I glad I did, but it has become one of my favorite sports games of all-time.\n\nTl;dr - If you're a fan of the sport, this is simply a must-have. If you have a passing interest, this game could actually help your understanding of the sport and also happens to be extremely fun and satisfying.\n\nOn the surface, just like baseball, cricket is a simple game: throw the ball, hit the ball, catch the ball, curse under your breath when you're out. Just like baseball, though, there is an immense amount of strategic subtlety, and unlike America's pastime, cricket has a much wider range of strategic nuance, offering endless combinations of fielders and bowling styles. DBC14 captures the essence of that strategy by putting players in complete control of their fielding alignments and customizing them for bowlers, batsmen, or both.\n\nWhich brings me to the crux of cricket and of DBC14 - what goes on at that little brown strip in the middle of the field. Bowlers are offered a wide array of options, especially pace bowlers. Toy with line and length, swing the ball to and fro, whatever you want to do to go for wickets. All this complexity is broken down into a relatively straightforward control scheme that is easy to learn but difficult to master. Pace bowling is definitely harder to get the timing on than spin bowling, but it's the pace men who offer the most excitement and get the most wickets.\n\nBatting is also somewhat straightforward. Batsmen have the ability to survey the field and get ideas on how to attack it, can choose to go for a shot in the air or along the ground or play a sweep. It's all mapped out quite cleanly, but the big key I found was timing; especially with pace bowlers, getting a good feel for the rhythm of the deliverly lets batsmen time the ball up and crush it. If the player is in rhythm, it's not difficult to churn out 20-30 runs an over, especially in T20 when bowlers are more aggressive. By that same token, mistime a big swing for the ropes, and you're down a wicket. Bowling AI is smart and will adjust even within overs to cover areas where you're consistently putting the ball, forcing you to stay on your toes and play an all-round innings at the crease.\n\nI will say that running and fielding felt a bit clunky. It was tough to know if I had hit the ball right to a man in the field because of the way the camera swings around, and (at least early on) I had a few run-outs because I got a little trigger-happy, but I also missed out on runs because I couldn't see where the ball was. It'd be helpful, too, when fielding, to have a diagram of where each button throws the ball. I still don't have it down and will find my fielder throwing at the bowler's stumps when the keeper has the other batsman dead to rights. Ultimately, though, I can forgive those things because the most important aspects of the on-field experience are just so strong.\n\nThe game has a variety of ways to play the sport, with all the Test nations, the three major domestic leagues (England, Australia, and India), and a bevy of formats covered, and if you don't like what's on offer, players can create their own content through the Don Bradman Academy, a robust customization engine where everything can be tweaked. (And, since this game contains little or no licensed content, players can create their own approximations of modern cricketers and teams). Players can also create their own leagues, tournaments, tour schedules, and even formats of the game through the DBA. It's a wonderful little tool that adds tremendous depth to what could have otherwise been a rather pedestrian between-match experience, and it might be my favorite feature of the entire game.\n\nI guess my biggest complaints are the lack of licensed content (addressed by the Don Bradman Academy system, but it's not quite the same), and the menu music. They only included a handful of tracks that get quite tiresome after a while, and I haven't found any way to add custom music to the game. That would be a wonderful feature that would keep me playing this game forever. Heck, I'm probably playing this game forever anyway. Run, don't walk, to buy Don Bradman Cricket 14.","November 4, 2015","true","46.0"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","24","27","2","0"

The only problem in this mode is that, the difficulty can get increased if you start doing well, and you need very good reflexes to bat at difficulties above PRO. Also, you cannot change the batting order of your player, at any point of time in career mode.\n+ There are lots of options to customise the game - pitch settings/weather/overs, etc.\n+ Game can get real addictive, once you know the basics.\n+ Great graphics and animations.\n\n- Online system is quite broken, but if you have friends who own the game, then it's easy to play matches with them.\n-  I know it's not much, but you cannot see the bowling statistics fully in the scoreboard. Also, some other statistics which were present in the EA versions of cricket are absent.\n- No auto save features while playing. You only have an option to Save and Quit the game.\n- The AI hardly ever makes a mistake.

There is realism, depth (batting especially will take a little while to get the hang of), and room for the community to step in and create players, teams and umpires. And there is a long-awaited CAREER MODE, where you start as a 16 year old and work your way up from County/State/Province-level to International selection.\n\nThere isn't a large amount of stadia, but this is to be expected of a first release. Clearly gameplay has been the focus and DBC14 is better for it.\n\nIn my opinion, DBC14 is worthy of the 'Don Bradman' branding. Well done Big Ant on hitting this one for six.\n\nP.S.

The left analog stick is used to choose which foot to play (i.e front or back foot) and the right stick dictates which direction you want to play the shot. Holding the bumper buttons and flicking the right stick in the direction you want to hit the ball, produces different shots. For example, holding the left trigger button with the left stick causes you to hit a lofted shot. It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you master the controls, it feels very intuitive, vastly superior to previous cricket game controls and a lot of fun.\n\nBowling has also been changed for the better. Instead of having a dot on the ground and showing your opponent where you are going to bowl, there is a new control scheme. First, you have to choose the length of the ball that you want to bowl, using the face buttons (i.e A for good length, B for short length or Y for full length). As your bowler approaches the crease, you flick back the right stick and then flick forward in the direction you want to bowl the ball. This is an amazingly new and fresh way to bowl in cricket games. It allows for a more authentic bowling experience and is alot more fun and engaging, then placing a dot on the pitch and just passively pressing buttons. I can't believe the day where I would say that bowling is potentially more fun than batting in a cricket game.\n\nGraphics are nice and crisp. The grounds are rendered really well and the lighting is top-notch.\n\nSounds of the bat hitting the ball are satisfying to hear and the appeals of bowlings are exciting.\n\nOverall, Don Bradman Cricket 14 is an amazing sports game. It is definitely up there with other sports games such as FIFA and the NBA 2K games, in terms of realism, fun and authenticity.\n\nA must-have for all cricket fans and even just fans of sports in general.\n\n9/10.","October 1, 2015","true","21.2"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

The batter waits and waits, only to compress years of technique, judgement, critical thinking and agility into a fraction of a second. The ball passes and the batter spends the next minute absorbed in contemplation, replaying the ball, his stroke, pondering the movement off the pitch, re-calculating the threat posed while battling their own demons of self-doubt.\n\nIt's this combination of fear, and technical ability  shrunk into a second that digital translations of cricket have never been able to capture. For all their computational prowess, ability to handle the multiple algorithms (a.k.a. procedural generation) determining small details like the variable bounce of a pitch, the aloofness of the English weather, or even something as fundamental as giving the red cherry a proper sense of gravity, developers have never been able to use the power of computers to imbue cricket games with any authenticity.\n\nIf you’re a cricket fan, this is absolutely essential. If you are a cricket fan and a gamer, this is a game you really want to own. Remember though this is more a cricket simulator than an arcade classic and as such you are going to be spending your first few hours figuring out exactly how the game plays.\n\nIn the end, and I have to mention this, the match of Don Bradman Cricket 14 plays out like cricket should.","March 10, 2015","true","69.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

One thing I find very difficult in this game is the steep learning curve for batting and bowling. Bowling is probably a tad easier than batting since batting involves making all your decisions in mere seconds which includes footwork, line and length and direction all in 1 second. That being said does not necessarily mean that the batting is broken, on the contrary if your footwork, timing and shot selection is spot on you are in for something amazing. A lot of people do not understand why they find edges even after timing the ball perfectly and choosing the right shot selection, but they forget that the 3rd element in batting the direction of your feet when playing the shot. The only way to master the batting is time in the nets, and alot of it.\n\nOverall this game is by far the best cricket game, no cricket game before this come close and it is definately worth the money for cricket fans. Casual players will maybe get frustrated by the batting and bowling controls because of the complexity, but I love it, the game tends more to a simulation than being an arcade cricket game.

Picking up the ball that is simply lying on the ground can be quite the task. Batting in multiplayer can also present a few problems most notably when they are deciding whether to run or not. Standing in front of the crease is also an issue when clearly the bowler or wicket keeper has the ball in their hand.\n\nBut overall, I'd call myself a casual cricket fan (I mainly watch Tests) - I KNOW, people find that odd too lol. This is an excellent cricket game that really holds strong to core values of real life cricket. I'd go as far as to say that this is a cricket simulator, because the attention to detail of the batting is quite remarkable that puts other cricket games to shame.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- Batting is a blast once you learn the techniques, the first 4-5 hours of gameplay I was absolutely hopeless getting 15 runs and out, you really need to learn the controls, (which overall isn't too difficult)]\n- Bowling is also one of my favourite features, I never thought I'd enjoy bowling as much, being a casual cricket fan, this put some perspective in the techniques that real life bowlers used and gave me some appreciation for what they do.\n- The Interace is intuitive and I personally feel it's better than Rugby League Live 3's.\n- The Academy is also a great feature.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Fielding is overall O.K.

And nothing came as close to cricket as this one. Probably EA's 2005 and Brian Lara 2007, Ashes Cricket 2009 were good, but this one just feels right.\nGraphics are not that impressive, but good enough.

I haven't quite got hang of bowling, especially spin, but even that feels good.\nThere is even DRS system, quite fun to review umpire's decision and watch it.\nI got limited edition from local e-Tailer. It came with controller in the box, maybe not as good as XBox 360 one, but does feel good compared to sub-500 INR controllers I have used in past.

The specialist batsman is great to play a few shots with, but I am struggling to keep my concentration, particularly if I've managed to get onto a couple of early boundaries (the same issue I had in real life)!\n\nMy highlights after approx 15 hours?  Taking a 5 wicket haul for SA against Tassie and the 50 I scored for Derbyshire with my young opener off 13 balls!\n\nThe only gripes I have with the game are the commentary being inserted at random as about 1/2 the time it doesnt make sense (so I've taken to playing music at the same time) and the grounds...I've had an English County game and SA v Tas at the MCG!  These are small issues though when compared to the important part of a cricket game...do the mechanics feel engaging, fluid and as though you are controlling your player...in short, yes!\n\nThis game is fun to play and being a cricket game has enough stats to keep a cricket fan entertained.

I know that sounds like it's not hard seeing as there are so few out there but it really is well done.  Easy controls to get to grips with, there is perfect balance between it not being too hard too easy to peform bowling, batting or fielding.  So many other games made catches or bowling nearly impossible due to there being such a fine line between perfection or oblivion.   Also this game does not give you wickets left, right and centre.  You might Five-fors, you might get hat-tricks.  But they will be as often as the professionals get, you will get that stubborn batsman whom you try everything to get out and then boom a simple shot sends the bails flying and your arm raising in triumph.\n\nOne thing I hope for in the future is perhaps the addition of more stadiums, better commentary (it does get a little repetitive) and better designed character models (Jimmy Anderson looks like a caveman).","April 23","true","56.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You need an analog stick to accuractely place your shots. A keyboard just will NOT work.\n\nOnce you get hang of the controls, ball physics and other awesome mechanics of this game, you will truly fall in love with it.\n\nThere are definitely issues with a few jerky animations here and there and a little boring and monotonous commentary, the great gameplay easily makes up for these issues.\n\nPros:\n- Great gameplay for a Cricket game, easily the best of this and the last generation combined.\n- Detailed controls. Easy enough to start hitting boundaries and sixers but really hard to master.\n- Great replays, DRS (Decision Review System), ball mechanics and other fun stuff including lots and lots of statistics.\n- Online Multiplayer mode with the ability to save games to continue later (You can play full Test matches with your friends).\n- Lots and lots of very realistic looking players and and team uniforms.\n- Many game modes including a Career mode, tournaments, competitions and casual play.\n- Great comfortable camera angles to choose from.\n- Did I say you can field manually?\n- Full ability to make changes to teams and players through the Don Bradman Academy. Now play your favorite historical cricket players!\n- The most realistic and fun cricket game for many years now.\n\nMiddleground:\n- Steep learning curve.\n- Could do with a field mini-map during balling and batting.\n- Decent graphics and audio (excluding commentary).\n- Requires an Xbox 360 controller for Windows.\n- Not a great teacher for those new to Cricketing rules etc. (Not an issue for cricket lovers)\n\nCons:\n- Twitchy animations sometimes.\n- Due to the complex nature of the game, there are some bugs and issues which should hopefully be ironed out quickly. As of this review, such issues are few and dont really bother too much.\n- Commentary can get boring fast.\n- Lack of "Voice Chat / Typing Chat" during multiplayer matches. You have to use Steam, TeamSpeak, etc. for it.\n\nIf you are a cricket lover and own a gamepad to play this with, get Don Bradman Cricket 14 now! And if you don't own a gamepad, still get this game and buy an Xbox 360 controller ASAP!\n\nNow I am done selling this, go and get it!\n\nEdit: Made a few changes to the Pros and Cons list.","June 30, 2014","true","25.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The controls are fluid and responsive for both batting and bowling, the graphics are very nice and getting a good score feels genuinely rewarding. The upper difficulty levels are brutal, but not impossible. With recent patches, nicks carrying behind have become far more common which makes fast bowling as a career player much more relevant and the ability to skip to your turn while batting means you are no longer forced to call for runs as the non-striker when you can't see where the ball went. These are all excellent changes.\n\nTHE CONS:Anyone who's played a FIFA game before is familiar with the concept of rubber-banding and this game can really take it to the extreme. If the game decides you're out, you're out and if a fielder has to break the sound barrier running from square leg to take a catch on the boundary at deep long off to make that happen, then so be it. If your team is going to lose, it's going to lose and if the number 10 batsman on the team has to hit 300 off 90 balls to make that happen, then it's going to happen. It can be interesting, at least, to see all the ways the game can come up with to shaft you.","December 14, 2014","true","86.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Gone are target recticules that you place where you want the ball to land. In their place is a method that requires timing and finesse, and feels an awful lot more like you are actually bowling.\n\nBatting strokes are well implemented, with the full range available to you including fancy tricks such as reverse sweeps and ramp shots. Footwork is as important to batting as it is in real life too, and if you get this really wrong then it doesn't matter what stroke you choose, you'll still be in trouble.\n\nThere are a wide variety of ways of playing the game, with all formats included. They've also got around the issue of not having any licenses by allowing you to automatically download the highest rated user mods, which quickly adds in the most important national and international teams and players. I was particularly pleased that they've included a Career mode, allowing you to take a single player all the way from local obscurity to international success.\n\nThis all sounds great right? However, after a little while a few significant issues came to light that mean I just can't make a general recommendation, as much as I want to.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThere is a massive leap in difficulty between the Amateur and Professional skill levels when you're batting. To me, this is the biggie. At Amateur level I can easily score centuries with my wet behind the ears rookie without even trying. It's so forgiving, I don't really need to concentrate much on what I'm doing at all. Switch to the next difficulty up though, and there is an enormous difficulty spike, which try as I might I just can't get over.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like that the game can be made that tough. Hell, I'd love to be in a position where I can work towards playing at Professional difficulty. Unfortunately, the grind and the way the game punishes you for even the slightest mistakes at that difficulty just saps any enjoyment I have, leaving me with no desire to continue banging my head against a brick wall.\n\nThere has to be some way of easing you in, some kind of halfway house that helps you grow into it. I've spent hours in the nets and in practice matches, and the feedback it gives you is helpful, but you don't get that help once you step into an actual match that matters, and the small margin for error has often left me wondering what I did wrong that got my batsman out.\n\nAnother gripe I have is the reliance on red, green and yellow to show whether a delivered ball is short, on a length or full. I know I'm in the minority here, but being partially colourblind makes this even harder. It's not bad enough that it is a deal breaker for me, but some other way of showing the difference, or even just being able to customise the colours would be really helpful.\n\nThen there's fielding. There are a few issues here. The first is that the game doesn't provide a fielding 'radar' when you're batting, and the only way of seeing how the opposition have set the field is by going to first person view and looking around. In general I love it when a dev is this committed to realism. The problem here is I think they've gone too far. Having to do this every single time you think they might have made a fielding change is a massive drag, and becomes a real pain.\n\nAnother problem with this is the way they've implemented the camera for tracking the ball and helping you judge whether a run is on or not. A lot of the time it works, but I've lost count of when the camera angle chosen doesn't show me quickly enough for me to make a decision. In real life you'd be able to glance quickly and make a judgement, but this obviously isn't possible here.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis game is so frustratingly close to being amazing its ridiculous. If I wrote a checklist of all the things I want in a cricket game, this game meets almost all of them. Unfortunately, the few areas it falls short are so important, I just can't make a general recommendation.\n\nHowever, I can absolutely see there is a section of the market out there that would love this, If you have faster reactions than me and/or a greater tolerance for the grind it takes to make the leap in difficulty the game presents, then go ahead and have a blast.","February 14","false","38.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I have been playing cricket games for as long as I can remember from Graham Gooch's cricket on the C64, Super International cricket on the SNES, most of the thoroughly excellent Brian Lara games, the complex cricket captain series, the hit and miss quality of the EA series and more recently the frustrating codemasters releases and Cricket Revolution. This game very clearly sets a new benchmark for cricket games.\n\nThe batting system is joyus. The game rewards you for reactions and punishes you for playing premeditated shots. You are forced to consider the implications of working the ball around the pitch for long term accumulation or pinch hitting for quick runs and the bowlers adapt to your style of batting and actively try and out think you.\n\nBowling is a great improvement on previous games where instead of selecting a spot on the pitch to hit, you focus on line and length and take wickets through variation and guile. Bowling the same ball over and over again is, like real cricket, an invitation for the batsman to score where as subtle variations on pace, spin/swing and bowling position as well as bowling to a plan gives wickets in a similar way to real life.\n\nThis game is highly polished in particular the in game implementation of the DRS system and the availability of reviews is fantastic. Graphics are clean and crisp although not without the occasional error or glitch. I have not encountered anything game breaking personally.\n\nThe career mode is probably where I will spend most of my time. In a similar way to the 'be a pro' mode in Fifa games you start as a green and eager 16 year old and work your way through your local team through to the international arena honing and developing your skills along the way.\n\n\nAnother major positive for me is the ability to mod the game with real player and team likenesses and the continued support by the developer to patch in functional and bug improvements. Currently the co-op mode is missing but this is to be patched in at a later time. I appreciate the effort to get the game to the market and it clearly has been designed and developed by people who love the game. Once co-op mode has been release I can see this becoming a very popular feature.\n\nIn short, if you are a cricket fan and you are sitting on the fence about this game then I can assure you there is enough here to keep you entertained. It plays more like cricket than any other game I have played. If you need me, I'll be in the nets.","August 28, 2014","true","50.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The bowling and batting controls are new and logical, whilst nice touches like the DRS system make it a well put together package. Scoring rates are realistic (don't expect to go pasting bowlers all over the place from the off) and sensible bowling is often rewarded.  The lack of players is made up for by a set up that allows for a mod community to make up for this, who have already made custom umpires (so far there are very good Steve Bucknors and Dickie Bird but no David Shepherd yet...).\n\nThe terrible commentary (simple crowd noises would have suited me to be honest) and less good fielding are things you can live with.

This makes it a lot more challenging.  Don't expect to be any good at this straight away - it will require practice.  For anyone being put off by the requirement of a controller, don't be.  It really is necessary, there's no way you'd be able to do this with a mouse and keyboard.  It's more of a cricket simulator than an arcade style game\n\nThe graphics aren't great, but they're better than other cricket games.  At least the players look real and not like someone who's been involved in a nasty industrial accident.\n\nThe commentary is somewhat irritating, but the same can be said of almost all commentary in any sports games.  Once you've heard it a few times, it doesn't really change.\n\nI'm running this on a mid 2011 iMac running Bootcamp and it runs pretty well.  The only difference from stock is a RAM upgrade to 16GB.

Difficult to master and one truly for the cricket fanatic. If BLIC 2005 was the hit and giggle, slap and tickle t20 of the cricket gaming arena, then this is test cricket. The bowling and batting controls are new and logical, whilst nice touches like the DRS system make it a well put together package. Scoring rates are realistic (don't expect to go pasting bowlers all over the place from the off) and sensible bowling is often rewarded.  The lack of players is made up for by a set up that allows for a mod community to make up for this, who have already made custom umpires (so far there are very good Steve Bucknors and Dickie Bird but no David Shepherd yet...).\n\nThe terrible commentary (simple crowd noises would have suited me to be honest) and less good fielding are things you can live with.

Overall easily the best cricket game that I've come across. It's fun batting and bowling, which has seemingly been a tough task in most cricket games (lol).\n\nAlthough I don't quite understand any overarching batting strategy existing in the game, i.e. unsure if you can demoralize the bowler... (there could be mechancs like that, could not tell), it's fun dealing with each delivery for its merits since the controls are well designed.\n\nThe bowling is more difficult to master, but I felt effectiveness in employing an overall strategy rather than just trying for a wicket every ball. That feels like quite a feat for a cricket game since in other games there's usually a sweet spot or a common strategy to rinse-repeat. Didn't feel like that in this game. That said, I'm not quite convinced by the spin bowling in this game. Hurts my thumbs.\n\nI feel the statistics element of the game could be improved. Cause effect between games played and statistics (outside of career mode) should be clearer. And the career mode could have tournaments in it - would make sense to me. Also why can't a batting alrounder open the batting? :)\n\nOverall I have fun playing this game. Can play, watch some TV, chill out. Was rather addictive to get my first character into all the international teams, and as captain.","April 11","true","151.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thankfully, Big Ant studios have done anything but and have possibly made the best cricket game ever. The detail that has gone into this game is quite remarkable. From the sheer number of teams, camera angles, real-life aspects of the game (such as reviewing decisions),  to the career mode, batting, bowling and fielding mechanics, etc. The whole game feels polished, despite a few minor glitches here and there.\n\nBy far my most favourite aspect of this game is the career mode. You play through twenty seasons as you take a 16 year old cricketer through the ranks from domestic cricket to the career defining call from the international selectors. Whether you get selected by your international team depends entirely on your performances on the field (it's tougher than you'd think, trust me).  In fact the whole game is tougher than I expected, long gone are the days of the mannequin-style modelled cricketers  belting the ball out of the park every delivery. If you try that in this game, you're guaranteed to fail fairly quickly.\n\n\nPros:\n\n* Career mode\n* Online mode\n* Great selection of teams from the past and present\n* Varied amount of camera angles\n* Great graphics\n* Good commentary\n* Polished mechanics\n* More challenging than previous cricket titles.  (There is, at the time of this review, no radar to indicate where the fielders are when batting or bowling. However, when batting you can briefly look around in first-person mode, which is a nice touch.\n\nCons:\n\n* Licencing: No real names or brands, except Bradman, although you can get the real names of players easily by updating the teams from the community.\n* Can be glitchy, especially with the fielding, and strange animations at times.\n* Clunky menu\n\nConclusion: I did not purchase this game without consideration - £35.99, or your regional equivalent, is a lot of money, but this game has been well worth the purchase in my opinion. A must for cricket fans.","December 30, 2014","true","232.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

After 2007, EA abandoned the franchise, Codemasters tried their hands on it once in a while. But, Cricket was a dead game, almost the entire community resorted to "mods", Cricket 07 was modded to great extent to make it playable (enjoyable),\n\nPatches to fix AI, toughen bowling, make strokes close to realistic and stuff, but nothing gave the satisfaction of a complete game.\n\nDBC14 arrived at the scene and took it by storm, the price was high (considering I live in India, where this was close to 4k of our currency). I had second thoughts, but then I looked up the trailers, put faith in the developers and bought it.\n\nDespite the high price of the game, which is really needed for the developers to set up a base for future titles, the game is complete.

Although it is decent, I do have a few issues nothing major but issues nonetheless that I feel should Big Ant address them it make the new release a lot better.\n\nLack of customization in career.\n\nFor me any sports game that allows you to put yourself in the game has to really pull out the stops for it to feel like a representation of yourself and have it as you want it and while it's not bad, not having any options to change bowling actions or having a preferred style of batting whether you're more into wristy flicks and a batsman who is looking to time to ball instead of someone who is a brute and is looking to put a lot of power into the stroke.\n\nI think BAS missed a great opportunity to make the career mode one of the highlights but as it happens it's just lacking thus far.\n\nBatting.\n\nWhile for the most part, batting is generally okay I feel there is not a lot of variety in shot animations. Very seldom you will see a batsman go full blooded and extend the stroke for say a straight drive or a on drive as you see in game, for the most part they will generallly push the ball back down the ground and allow the timing to get the runs.\n\nAlso why no normal advancing shots? Seems strange you can't use your feet to work a ball into the gap instead of trying to launch it out of the ground.\n\nBowling.\n\nMuch like batting, bowling is in general done very well, can't argue with the variation given, although it's a little irritating that left handed bowlers stats are coded incorrectly Eg: When making a left arm pacer, in order to have a good outswinger from the left hander you have to set the best delivery to "In Swinger" perhaps a little nit picky but still, it shouldn't happen.\n\nFielding and AI\n\nProbably the weakest area for me. Well struck shots that are next to fielders just result in them standing still then diving too late to get the ball and that's rather frustrating to watch.\n\nCatching animations are also a little odd especially when the wicketkeeper is catching edges istead of just taking a regulation catch they will turn their back towards the ball and somehow just dive on it but catch it nonetheless although funny I don't think we would see MS Dhoni do that :P\n\nBowling against AI feels kind of frustrating at times, they seem to have a real tendency to sweep the spinners a lot even to balls pitched outside off stump and there isn't much penalty for it, not had them top edge or anything like that.\n\nEven against pace bowlers, bowling on a good length swinging away from off stump or even just bowling seam up outside the off stump they will just fly swat it away to the leg side without much thought yet when I try it, of course I conveniently edge it straight to the slips. A little frustrating in truth.\n\n\nBesides what I've said, It's honestly not a bad game if you're after a decent sim style Cricket game, It really has a lot of potential should BAS make further iterations and I certainly hope they do.","December 10, 2015","true","187.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I love it.\n\nBradman 14 is the cricket game that we have been waiting for. That's pretty much all you need to know. Finally a developer has cracked the combination of making a game feel like a proper simulation of the sport. It oozes cricketness. Sure, you can play it like a hit and giggle arcade game if you want, but if you also want to make a ponderous innings in the vein of Chris Tavaré, the game is more than happy for you to go out and block every single ball back to the bowler.\n\nThe graphics are very serviceable, animations are generally good although the bowling action isn't 100% smooth, with the ball popping out of the bowlers hand at slightly odd angles, I suppose rather a tricky thing to model though when you have to allow all the variations in bowling and outcomes that result. Batting is a real joy, I love spending a while at the crease fashioning a score. And then smashing a ball down a patrolling outfielders throat having forgotten he was out there. Foolish.\n\nCareer mode is wonderful. You take control of one person. You perform their every cricketing move, if you fancy it. I generally only bother with batting myself as I am a glory hunter who prefers not to toil too hard. I've not progressed too far, but I am happy in my role as a county cricketer. One day I'll develop the patience and progress to international level. Maybe.\n\nThere's still a couple of minor aesthetic issues with the game although the devs are actively patching it at the moment. Hopefully these will get resolved.\n\nAnyway, this review can all be boiled down to this: do you like playing cricket games on your computer? If so, buy this, you can't go wrong. Simple.","July 17, 2015","true","49.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

When I saw this game, while browsing through the game store, my interest was peaked. I had been looking for a worthy successor to 'Brian Lara Cricket' - a great game in it's own right - and this seemed to fit the bill. I was a little hesitant about the cost, but after reading the reviews I took the plunge.\n\nI have rarely enjoyed my first couple of hours playing a game as much as I did this one. Graphically - brilliant! Atmospherically - it's like being there. The controls are instinctive, and the ball moves dynamically depending on how the bat connects with it - as it should. I still haven't mastered the field settings but the day, as they say, is yet young. Another aspect that surprised me was the depth of history that the team choices can offer. We all have our sporting heroes and to be able to pick a team with them in it is great - even from some time ago.\n\nAll-in-all, I would highly recommend this game to all cricket fans. It is so good you can almost smell the grass. Play!","February 3, 2015","true","104.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This form of DRM has no place on Steam and should be voted down. It's a misguided attempt at preventing piracy, but what it means is that Steam members are treated as "guilty until proven innocent" every time they start the game.\n\nObviously this rules out "flight mode" gaming or when you don't have a connection. If you have a gaming laptop, sometimes you find yourself in places without a connection. But more than that, the principle of "checking in" with the game's uptight DRM system to prove you have a verified copy, is a pathetic insult.\n\nMost games on Steam DO NOT do this. Even big games like GTAV allow offline mode. They only require the internet when the game releases an update.\n\nAs a further insult, this game was originally released without the mandatory online check.. then in the next update they slipped it in as a "feature".

I have played all the EA and many Codemasters offerings from the 90s through to '11 when the last Codemasters game came out.\n\nHowever, baring that in mind I cannot recommend this game. This is based on a variety of factors and especially the price. This game, as far as I am aware, has never been on sale and has stayed at £35 or $50. For that amount of money you can buy far superior sports titles that are less likely to crash, do not require an internet connection whenever you launch it and look and play better. This game has complicated controls, that aren't easy to pick up because the tutorials (last time I played) haven't been updated. The sound is just terrible, between dull and repetitive commentary (although those that like cricket might say that it is quite spot on) and poor on the field sounds I usually turn the volume off and listen to a podcast.\n\nFurthermore, the game crashes way too much. In the past two weeks there have been a rush of patches after 6 months of silence. They made some nice changes but the whole game has been too unstable. This is especially the case considering I am not on any kind of beta channel and there is no option to only get major patches rather than the smaller ones the studio has been putting out.\n\nThe biggest issue, however, is that (based on my last playthrough) the game is NOT an accurate simulation. Between bowlers consistently bowling down leg and batsmen playing at nothing down off this is not cricket. Because it fails at its main task it is difficult to recommend the game. When including the other issues and price it is impossible, in my opinion, to give this game a passing grade.\n","June 19, 2015","false","416.1"," 6 of 23 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","6","23","0","1"

Big Ant have obviously put their heart and soul into this game and it has payed off. The fielders may do some funky/glitchy movement at times, but nothing that disadvantages you and takes away from the game at all. Batting feels authentic and has a real learning curve if you are a cricket game veteran, bowling is well made although feels boring at times (but that may just be me). The career mode is by far the standout though. If you enjoy cricket, and enjoy gaming, definitely pick this one up. If you don't have a real interest in cricket, probably give it a miss.","December 17, 2014","true","101.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The presentation is great and the visual integrity is impressive.\nOne of the first things I discovered when playing this game was the learning curve. This is a game you will have to spend a few hours playing just trying to get timing right and figuring out all the buttons. I inexplicably missed the tutorial and had a lot of fun trying to figure out how to even bowl. I think I had about 10 dead balls in a row before I figured it out and even once I did, no balls were quite common until I finally got a hang of it. I haven't had much experience batting just yet, but the controls are really interesting. The fact that the batting arc is matched to the sticks on the gamepad makes for much easier shot selection. This is a game that requires a game pad, and it is worth buying one to play this.\n\nSo far, I have played mostly career mode and this really excites me. I love the idea of progressing your pro through the various ranks, and I believe this will be a key mode for any future incarnations. I haven't played too much just yet, but I am hoping that the squad is just as dynamic in picking other players as it is in choosing you.\n\nOverally, very positive first impressions.

After a long time a true cricketing experience coming our way. Over all gaming expreince is new and refreshing and it makes you think about everything. There were\nalways issues with bowling in cricket games and most of them were really bad. But in this one is a excellent approach\napplied by Big Ant Games. Not only bowling looks and feeling interesting and fun, but batting is not that easy to do.\n\nYou need to play as a cricketer to enjoy the whole experience. But there are still some things which can be made better in terms of over all gaming expereice. I am sure they will be patching the bugs and make some more adjustment to enhance the game. A must buy if you have been playing crickets games all over your life. This is what you are waiting for.\n\nAlso please show your support to the team at Big Ants they have done a great job.","October 10, 2014","true","170.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure it's not a million pounds ea sports development but it's made with care and imagination ,you might get bored quickly with the commentary Which sounds a bit like that boring bloke on the IPL if you've seen that. But there's a fantastic muted pa system in the background.... So many great features. The realistic approach towards batting, bowling and fielding is one of the biggest assets of this game which no other cricketing game was able to provide till now. Tackling license problem with smart and creative idea is just exceptional and gives a buyer an idea that how much Bigant studios are determined to give the best of this game to the users. In spite of having lack of sponsors and not having a million pounds like EA sports development have they have managed to pull off things in a great manner. However few areas where it needs advancement are Commentary it can put you off, definitely graphics can get better and better, crowd need to be alive and small glitches here and there should be sorted (Like when you get a batsman out it should come out realistic more than often its batman who leaves the ball and it hits the stump which is very rare and is not that realistic in a way.","February 16, 2015","true","101.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But thanks to a group of passionate people at Big Ant, cricket game lovers have reason to hope for good circket games again.\n\nIn DBC 14, devs took a risky decision to revamp the whole gameplay system that existed before, but in hindsight, that has proven to be a vastly successful decision. Another great quality of the devs is their continuous engagement with fans on forums, especially in the early stages, and the willingness to respond to feedback with patches that either improved gameplay or removed bugs. The gameplay experience improved a lot over time.\n\nThis game isn't perfect, but I'm excited about the direction this game is headed in. Looking forward to DBC 16. Thanks again, Big Ant.","March 11","true","546.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The twin stick shot making is way better than choose-a-shot method of EA games. Bowling is also more fun than press-a-button. Especially since Spin and fast bowling uses different controls. I do wish they had the option for field radar. It does get annoying to keep looking through first person before every delivery since there really isn't any indication if there was a change in field placement. Also I really wish they would come out with a newer version of this game since it is now over two years old.","February 10","true","122.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't let challenge mean there is no enjoyment though, in career mode I was celebrating 20 runs like I scored a century and nothing felt as good as the first 50 and then 100.\n\nThere is an amazing modding community over at planet cricket and if you're a retro lover like I am or just want the latest kits and bat sponsorship go over there right now and spend a bit of time getting the mods in to your game because the immersion that the mods brings takes this already fantastic game to a whole new level. Sometimes I just scan around the ground in awe at how great it looks.\n\nMy Career is a great addition but it is a little barebones. That's not to say it isn't fun but don't expect NBA 2K level of career either.\n\n9/10 simply because nothing is perfect but this comes close. A must have for any cricket lover.","January 3","true","51.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite its simplicity dbc14 makes me want to keep playing. It has a perfect balance of competition where anyone can succeed but it is still hard to master. This level of complexity is aided by the many levels of difficulty which allow the game to be played by all. The only problem I have with the game is the Ai such as your fielders missing catches or letting balls slide past through their feet for boundaries. Furthermore the umpire has left me screaming at my screen where I have hit someone for lbw plumb and the umpire still says not out even after review. Despite these minor flaws db provides hours of fun at the perfect level of competition. The perfect game for all armchair cricketers.\n","June 4","true","161.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
