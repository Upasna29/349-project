The main difference between this one and Corruption is the setting and the amount of scenarios. Where Corruption has about 3 different scenarios to play through, this one only has one but I already like Floodings more because of how political action works. Essentially, rather than having dilemnas, you just have cards with things you can do to try and prevent severe flooding/rebels/various other bad things that will happen to your poor Pakistani people. Unfortunately, like Corruption, the game is awfully short but for 1.94 (on sale price) this game is a fun little brain teaser that really tests the management sim in me. I also have a softspot for games that attempt to be educational rather than being the next AAA Shooter. Definitely recommended.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXePo_RJ7Sc","August 12, 2015","true","0.9"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","89","25","28","9","0"

I heard that you can actualy beat the game.\n\n\n\nAs for formal stuff:\n\nPresident for a day: Floodings is nice casual turn-based indie game with elements of simulation and tycoon.\nGraphic and sound are very good for this type of game.\nGameplay, it may look childish, but it hell isnt an easie game\nI especialy liked resources system with using cards.\nIt is short, but its fun and you will surely replay it again using diferent tactics and methods trying to beat it.\n\nI would suggest devs to maybe implement sandbox dlc, with more cards and events to play, that way this can be great game.\n\nWith fairly cheap price, I recommend it to everyone who have spare 2,99 hell its pack of smokes or burger at fast-food.","August 13, 2015","true","3.1"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","59","17","29","10","0"

It's sort of half turn based where things happen each ingame day; however you can't sit on the one day forever because the game will progress. Also 10/10 newspaper realism because you can't make them happy.","August 19, 2015","true","0.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","6","8","3","0"

But in all, really enjoyed the challenge and how the developpers dealt with the options to solve issues.  I did buy it on special so feel it's a good deal.","August 13, 2015","true","3.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"
