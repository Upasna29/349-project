I don't mean that in a bad way and I think that was the aim of the devs here, so if you grew up with those kind of games like I did you'll probably get a nice feeling of nostalgia when playing.\n\nMy initial impressions after about a half hour of it is it controls well on my gamepad, which is critical for this kind of game.  Doesn't seem to suffer any major performance issues either.  Gameplay is a bit slower then a Sonic game & level design doesn't get that complex, but also generally doesn't feel frustrating which is a plus.\n\nOverall it plays fine and has enough variety in the traps, differences in the zones, and overall content to keep you busy for a little while.  For the price of a cup of coffee it's worth the couple hours you'll get out of it.","February 12, 2015","true","1.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

It had magnificent levels, absolutely awesome soundtrack and overally it gave to its player really good feeling despite having sometimes really challenging difficulty. In conclusion, it was a great success.\n\nReason, why I brought Rayman to here is how On A Roll 3D's beautiful retro-style gameplay reminds me of it a lot.\n\n- It has tiny puzzles every here and there, where you have to think most usually from one vision to few seconds to how to accomplish it, whilst not being just runthrough over the maps.\n- Levels are looking pretty with their effects (snowfall on mountains etc.) and the atmosphere while completing area stays entertaining from the start to the ending.\n- Map designs have been made remembering both player-types: common casual players and speedrunners.\n- Achievements are easily obtainable (pretty quick 100% for achievement hunters!).\n\nEvery level has its own soundtrack, which are decent and for every enemy type there is own sound effect, which are well chosen (or made).\n\nOnly downside which I've seen is that game has constant frame drops (60fps -> 51/55) but only when played in windowed mode. It seems that this behaviour happens only, if your desktop frequency is set over 60hz and you're using windowed mode, since game is locked on 60fps.\n\n\nTl;Dr: If you liked good, old games like Sonic's and Rayman's, you most probably like this too. 3,99€/$ is a worthy price for such pleasure from this game.","February 1","true","13.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/341090/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1583 products in account","IntroductionOn a Roll 3D is a simple retro platformer where you roll around trying to get to the end goal while collecting stars. If you think that sounds an awful lot like Sonic the Hedgehog you’d be right. This game is clearly inspired by old school Sonic games, from the level designs and graphics to the way bosses are destroyed. This a fun game in its own right and also pretty darn cute as well. There is however no story to be told.\n\n\nGameplayYou roll around, that’s about it. While you roll you have to collect stars and avoid dangerous death spikes, lasers and the like. There are also enemies along the way but you can easily jump on their heads and dispatch of them, the thing I had the biggest issue is was jumping onto small platforms and making sure I didn’t roll off since it is a ball and balls tend to roll. Your ball does not have any special powers or abilities which is a shame. A little something to spice things up every now and again would be fun. My favorite part of the gameplay was the puzzle aspect thrown in. Door in the way? You have to hit the switch or put something on top of it to get through.\n\nI used a game controller to play the game and the responses were good. The only issue I had was that I could not find a button on my controller that would pause the game, I still had to use my keyboard for that. The retro feel of the game is really compliment by being able to use the controller. I also just figured out after over two hours of play that you can change the color of the ball so I made mine pink.\n\n\nGraphics/AudioFor me the graphics reminded me too much of Sonic the Hedgehog, like the first level looks strikingly similar to Green Hill Zone. However, the graphics aren’t so much of a direct copy and more of homage, that being said I do think the graphics could have been polished a bit more. The graphics are more akin to a Playstation One game than what I would expect in 2016. While graphics aren’t everything and this game is fun either way, they could have invested a little more into it. The audio is fine, though, the levels have catchy tunes and I had no issue there at all.\n\n\nPros\n+ The game is very cheap.\n+ Offers a good amount of gameplay for the price, game has six levels with three areas each plus a boss battle each time.\n+ Overall presentation looks good.\n+ It has trading cards.\n\nCons\n- Only one play mode, no time trials or hidden areas that I could find.\n- While the graphics weren’t bad they could have been better, the menu interfaces were also simplistic.\n\n\nFinal ThoughtsI do recommend this game to players who enjoy platformers, the game has a nice price tag and is well made. It’s fun, colorful and has great controls. This game also has achievements which are relatively easy to collect which is another draw. Buy it, play it and enjoy it you won’t regret it.\n\n\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games to F2P games.","March 12","true","2.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Its like playing a Sonic the Hedgehog game that's fun with a ball.\n\nThe later stages get hard and the bosses take a lot of hits before you defeat them, whereas 2 hits from the bosses can kill your character.\n\nThere's some replayability in the game. It took me almost 5 hours to beat it, but anyone really talented with Sonic the Hedgehog or Sonic 2 should do better.\n\nThere are decent acheivements, no cards yet. The controls using a 360 wired controller were decent.\n\nThere were a few annoyances with the game. I didn't like the menu defaulting to settings instead of play game. After I cleared world 6. it defaulted to Start game.\n\nThere are 18 stages and 6 stages that are primarily boss fights. There are 4 stages to each world, 3 and then the 4th is a boss fight.\n\nYou start with 5 lives and after losing them or quitting, you can restart with 5 lives again. When you lose, you keep progress for levels completed, you just have to restart the level you died on at the beginning.\n\n","July 4, 2015","true","4.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/epeternally/recommended/341090/","epeternally","Princess","http://steamcommunity.com/id/epeternally/","2703 products in account","On A Roll is a short, low budget 2.5D platformer with obvious Sonic the Hedgehog influences. To the game's credit, it manages to incorporate elements of the Sonic games without ever feeling like a clone. It's definitely more inspiration than copying wholesale. The controls are also spot on. Movement with a 360 controller feels very tight and precise, and I never had trouble getting my character where I intended for it to be. Graphics are a big area where this game falls short. It doesn't look quite as bad in motion as the trailer makes it look, but that's not exactly a big compliment. The use of simple shapes for characters feels lazy, and the background elements aren't much better. On top of not having well put together graphics, I've also encountered some very obvious shadow glitching through large sections of the game. Not sure if this is a universal problem or specific to my rig, it doesn't break the experience, but it definitely doesn't add to the feeling of this being a well made and polished game.\n\nLevel design is actually quite solid, surprisingly so given how low budget the game feels. There's a mix of straightforward platforming and light physics puzzles. I'm not generally a fan of puzzle platformers, but here those elements are pretty innocuous. It's genuinely a fun game to play and there's far worse platformers on Steam. Music is decent too, if repetitive. The light and cutesy tone of the soundtrack fits with the feel of the game. The game only has partial controller support out of the box for a 360 controller, which is hard to forgive in a 2015 game, especially a platformer. The majority of the game can be handled with a controller just fine, but using menus and resetting the positions of movable objects both require a keyboard.\n\nOn A Roll made me smile, which is more than I can say for a lot of games in my library, even ones that are objectively better than this. If you grew up playing 2.5D games like Pandemonium, you should get a kick out of it. The game touches on nostalgia buttons that I didn't realize I had, and while the execution could use improvement, seeing an homage to that style of game feels good. It's only a few hours long, but for the very modest price that seems fair. For many people, the low quality graphics and being yet another puzzle platformer on Steam is going to be a dealbreaker, but if you've read this far and are still actually interested, you could definitely do a lot worse for your money. On A Roll may not be winning any game of the year awards, but it is enough fun to be worth looking past the flaws, especially if you're nostalgic for PS1 era 2.5D platformers.","May 7, 2015","true","5.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Kudos to those games, but, sometimes I just want a simple, old-fashioned platformer. On a Roll 3D delivers that in spades. It's challenging, but not so much that I ever became aggravated. The visuals are are outdated in a pleasant kind of way--a throwback to the PC games of yesteryear. Nostalgia, here I come! The controls are responsive and the game appears to be, for the most part, glitch free. I shouldn't have to praise a game for being functional, but sometimes indie titles are a little spotty with control schemes and gameplay. If you're a fan of Sonic, Crash Bandicoot, or the original Gex, you will probably enjoy On a Roll 3D.

This game looks straight out the late 90's like PC shareware/demoware. It brings nostalgia to my very early encounters with windows 98 and it's plethora of low quality games and shovelware, and it plays like a game from around then. If this puts you off, this is definately not for you in the slightest. If you are not interested in playing something that doesn't feel new or even polished then this is also not for you. This is for people who understand that it's a small game with low quality cheesy textures and simple (but sometimes clunky feeling) controls. It will also help if you have played windows games from the 90's.\n\nThere are still small points in the game where it incorporates stuff from the 21st century, the shadows are pretty nice and when the camera rotates round as you move round a corner (pretty sure this happens like in the second half) it's something quite surreal and contradicting to the debatably eye-sore 90's style.\n\nA few things to outline\n\n- It took just over 2 hours to complete it start to finish. So expect play times around that, probably less if you're not as crap as me. I'd say between 1 1/2 hours to 2 is a reasonable guesstimate. I have not completed 100% achievements thus far and however the remainder of achievements I haven't completed is the time trial for the first level (which will probably take a few tries to crack) and the grindy achievements (get x score, collect x stars). The majority were collected through a straight playthrough. This could add another hour or so to play time. There is also 4 challenges on each levels (collect all stars, kill all enemies, don't die, don't get hit) which add to the replayability of the game but there's nothing really outside of just having a optional challenge that makes you want to do that. It does boost your score though.\n\n- The controls are just the arrow keys however some of the controlling of the ball is a bit clunky and hard to grasp i.e. jumping isn't as sensitive as I'd want it to be and therefore precise jumping could be difficult sometimes. It does keep with the 90's windows platforming kind of games where controlling was far from perfect, so I guess it just adds more 90's. The levels aren't that difficult though so it's not too frustrating and the game isn't ruined by it either.\n\n- Again don't expect major graphical content in it. Unless you have a 90's texture fetish.\n\nOverall the game is pretty fun. It's nothing spectacular and it feels like 90's shovelware but I got some fun out of it. I personally wouldn't recommend it at full price though (I got it in a bundle, but a sale would suffice too), unless you understand the above points and like what you see. It'd be more suitable at half of it personally but with 100% achievements and everything completed you'd struggle to not find 3+ hours in it and £1/hour is usually a good ratio...\n\nAnyway I was hoping on writing this review in hopes of putting in a 'I'm on a roll' pun, such as 'I'm getting through my massive library of games and have completed this is 2 hours, looks like I'm on a roll', however it's transformed into something semi-serious and I can't be bothered to delete it and it looks quite impressive and if you are still reading this, go outside.\n\nAlternative drinking game (or biscuit eating game): Take a sip (bite) everytime 90's is mentioned.","August 14, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
