However after playing, judging from a buyer's perspective, $5 is too much to ask for this game. Even at 75% off I'd still steer away.\n\nWhy? Because it's really bad. First of all the story doesn't exist and you suddenly got thrown into some crappy maps for no reason. Crappy because if it's an outdoor map, there will be so many holes on the ground that kill you more often than the enemies ( and every time you die you're forced to watch an un-skipable long scene of your character being banged by the enemies before being taken back to level selection menu. A quick restart button is not included ). If it's an indoor map it'll be a straight tunnel or similar, sometimes there are turns that serves no purpose because they're all dead ends without collectibles. Next up is the combat. For a game in which everything is made from cubes including the enemies, you'd expect to see features like crippling your enemies or tearing them block by block, but no. All enemies are solid, no cubes falling apart until they die. Also there's no different in damage dealt to different body parts including the head. Weapons are poorly designed, for example the shotgun's damage stays the same regardless of how far are you from your target ( there's damage spread so that's no slug rounds ).\n\nOverall this is a badly designed game. Kudos for making the game bug-free with colorful environment but it doesn't help with the mood. I went through the 9 short levels of the game without getting any excitement. For anyone who's interested in buying, I suggest waiting for a huge discount or a bundle to get it, for collecting purpose only. There are far better games at $5. I should also think twice before participating in any "vote for free keys" events from now on.","June 7, 2014","false","1.4"," 564 of 603 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","564","603","0","26"

Don't buy this game if for anything other than cards\n\n\n---6-26-15 Real Review(I Guess)---\nThis game is pretty much= Hold MB1 while aiming at enemies, while also not falling off edges.\nMovement is floaty. Music is pretty bad, but I've heard worse. I even kinda like dubstep, but I personally wouldn't really call this music that. Honestly I wouldn't recommend buying this game to play, only to get the cards like I did, I suppose, if that's your thing.\n\n---\nLaziness made me not make a real review after I was Steam messaged by the "dev"(or at least the "dev" of Road Redemption, their profile says they are the publisher of many games on Steam AS well as "100% free games for influential Steam members") offering me a free Steam key for Road Redemption if I wrote a real review, whether good or bad. Free game for just a fair review.\n\nWhile I understand that devs probably dislike comical reviews like mine that truly doesn't say much about the actual game, I also don't believe in them paying someone who has a popular comical review to write a "real" review.\n\nI guess I'm all for transparency, and I just think paying off reviewers for any kind of review is even worse than my comical review.

Not once. Not during the opening level where you pointlessly murder clumps of 1x1 textured cubes with a hideously underpowered weapon. Not during the second level where you murder said clumps with a hideously overpowered weapon or the underpowered weapon. Not during the third level where you murder said cubes with a hideously glitchy melee weapon. And not during the 7th level when you get a fairly unique but boring weapon... and that's it. There's no more weapons. There's no more enemies. There's only nine levels. You can fall through the map if you so much as breathe wrong. And this is being sold as a FINISHED PRODUCT.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/303390/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Stolen from your home, Dead Bits plops you into a voxel world of deadly testing in a retro inspired circle strafing hell. The rules are simple: grab a gun, kill anything that moves, and try to stay alive amid the hordes running your way and the deadly traps in your path. So what's the catch? Well, pretty much everything after the first level..\n\nDead Bits is a simple game, which I'm perfectly fine with, but it does so very little with everything that it attempts that it's just plain boring. Enemy AI is entirely nonexistent, running toward you with the fever of a teenage girl who caught a glimpse of her favorite pop idol walking buy. This more or less devolves the game into running backwards while holding down the trigger, having to fear more about falling off the edge of the map than anything the enemies might do. The guns are dull and lack any sense of power or recoil, which makes mowing down waves of bullet sponge enemies even less interesting.\n\nThe most egregious thing about Dead Bits however is how bloody frustrating it can be, by way or deliberately inflating the difficulty for no reason but to make you angry. Instant kill obstacles that you're never made aware of abound, making for numerous deaths which feel not at all your own fault, and a complete lack of checkpoints turns the lengthier levels into absolute chores to complete. The extended death animation is particularly annoying, itself taking too long to finish and then proceeding to boot you to the level select screen so you can wait for levels to reload before trying them again. I completed the games brief 9 levels in just under 2 hours, but it only took me that long because I died at least a dozen times for cheap reasons every level.\n\nThough it's rather simplistic, I actually did like the cel-shaded art style developer Microblast was going for with most of the game, though for whatever reason they weren't content to stick with it and instead chose to go with a completely different style for the guns and character models. The end result is a complete mess of conflicting styles and really puts to waste the great foundation they had before they added the odd pseudo realistic elements.\n\nDead Bits is the sort of game I'd expect to see a student or modder put out as a first step toward something more ambitious and polished. If that were the case it might be a commendable, if heavily flawed, first attempt at making a game, but as a finished retail product there is no way I could advise anyone to pick it up, which is to say nothing of wasting your time and sanity playing it. I feel there was potential here at some point, but in the end it's about as enjoyable as banging your head against a brick wall, and could very well do you just as much harm.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 15, 2014","false","1.8"," 98 of 114 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","98","114","0","1"

Good luck shooting enemies when you're falling to your death by backing up every couple seconds.\n-Unlimited ammo, so forget any form of tactical shooting, spraying and praying is fully encouraged. Taking away any challenge from the actual COMBAT.\n-The sounds are in the wrong places. I'm running outside and I hear the echoing as if I'm inside a cave. I enter a tunnel, and it sounds like I'm outside.\n-Too short. I guess the dollar price tag COULD make that acceptable, but I pay $20 for games that get me 100+ hours of gameplay. That's a maximum of 20¢ per hour, this game is charging you $1 for 20 minutes worth of missions (If even that much.) That's a ripoff.\n-The music is an edgy teen's dream.

Here's a gun, shoot those guys, watch them explode in a mess of cubes.  Ok, this could be fun to mess around with.  That feeling quickly fades once you start going through the monotony of the following levels.  Enemies essentially consist of kamikaze monsters that run straight at you with reckless abandon.  They swing wildly and miss as you circle strafe around them, but the game throws a red puff on your screen indicating you've been hit anyway.  That leaves the strategy to walking backwards and killing the enemies as they filter toward you.  But wait just one second, because some levels make the ground behind you magically disappear causing you to back into your death.\n\nAnd death is so much fun.  There are no checkpoints and every death kicks you back to the level select screen, because who doesn't want to reselect and reload the same level constantly?  Of course, if you like reselecting and reloading the same level you are going to love this...platforming!  Very few games do first person platforming well, and this is clearly not one of them.  One section has you jump from disorienting spinning cube to disorienting spinning cube.  Fun times.  There are also moving platforms that for some reason, even when you are standing on them, don't move you.  So you have to actually walk with the platform as it moves toward your destination.\n\nThe gunplay in this is also rather poor.  The weapons are bland and boring and pack no punch.  The smg sounds more like a typewriter than a firearm.  Occasionally a kill will trigger a slo-mo moment.  Unforunately, it's not the kind like Killing Floor that allows you to pull off a couple quick headshots, but the kind where everything just slows down around you for a couple seconds and then you carry on.  The melee weapon is a frustrating tool you are forced to use due in part to poor hit detection using it, and the aforementioned poor hit detection when enemies swipe at you.  Your best bet is to creep toward enemies slowly and stopping as soon as you pull one, since enemies only start their kamikaze attack once you reach a certain distance threshold.  But by creep I don't mean use the crouch button.  It's there and entirely pointless.\n\nThe concept of the game seems decent on the cover, but the execution leaves much to be desired and I wouldn't recommend it.  If you want to walk backwards and shoot things play Serious Sam.","June 7, 2014","false","1.2"," 53 of 74 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","53","74","0","0"

Absolutely not.\n\nThis is a First-Person Shooter game, a relatively short one at that.\nThe entire game is 9 levels long, which sums up to around...30 minutes?\nLonger if you suck at this game.\n\nThe game is fun, because it does not stop you from what you are supposed to do - shoot enemies.\n\nHowever, the fun is killed because of these things:-Very restricted and slippery mouse movement\n-Cheap enemy and platform placement\n-Awkward jumping\n-No map to indicate where you are in the level\n-No checkpoints\n\nThat's right - if you die, you go back to the beginning of the level, no questions asked.\n\nI do like that there is literally infinite ammo in the 2/3 weapons that you get (this game only has 3 weapons - an assault rifle, a shotgun and an...icicle?) and that makes the game fun, because you can go crazy while shooting. But what hinders everything is the really awkward and restricted mouse movement.\nPlayer movement isn't that bad, it's the jumping that can really put you off.\n\nYou will be falling off the world a lot in this game, especially on levels 5 and 6.\n\nThe music is just...horrible. It really has horrible music.\nI am the kind of guy who really hates these...wub-wub songs. And this game's full of them.\n\nIt is a nice distraction, and a fun one at times, but this game honestly is bad and I do not recommend you play it.\nThis game feels like an alpha version and doesn't really deserve a place on Steam.\n\nDead Bits gets a score of: 3.7/10.0\n"Good for a 10 minute distraction, nothing else.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/303390/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nDead Bits is one of those games that look amazing at a first glance, just because it's different and it baits you with cool concepts, which in this case work only on paper. The game begins with a short story about how the alien which you control, Quilly was abducted by another one named Quanton while he was sleeping and forced to complete all of his tests in order to escape. From there onwards you have to complete nine distinct levels which make absolutely no sense and only get more annoying and less cool as you advance through them; as for the story perspective, scrap all that because nothing the game has to offer makes any sense in that matter, as the levels aren't even tied-in, meaning you will have to select the next one individually from a menu once you've completed one of them. While the first two levels are the closest to what the game seemed to be from its trailer and screenshots, once you get over that, it only gets more annoying and pointless as time passes and you see how stupid it can truly become.\nRating: 2.5\n\nGameplay\nThere are nine different levels, each meant to have its unique twist, starting with the first two that respect the cubic look of the environment, which is probably one of the main reasons that made anyone buy this thing, in which you will have to use the guns at your disposal to get rid of basic enemies, and continuing to the rest of the seven remaining levels which range from way worse to what the hell is this thing. While they are definitely unique in their own way, most of the levels won't even work properly as enemies will often get stuck or fail to spot you making the entire challenge feel ridiculous as you'll probably die falling through some inexplicably placed hole more often that you will by actually being defeated. On top of all that, the bugs are countless as you will often get pushed by invisible enemies off the map, jump in the wrong direction or not being able to jump at all when you should.\nRating: 1\n\nGraphics\nThe cubic look of its universe is probably what attracted anyone to this title, but unfortunately it only looks like that for the first two levels, which you can complete in less than three minutes; from there onward the game tries to be unique by adding a new twist to each level, making horribly designed mazes, dark corridors that feel pointless above scary and one way alien space ship highways designed using Microsoft Paint.\nRating: 2\n\nAudio\nThe sound effects are as basic as they can get, meaning that you'll probably find them in the first page of Google results under some basic sound resources website; as for the soundtrack it doesn't sound exactly horrible, but neither is it good or fitting the game in any shape or form, as it ultimately comes down to whether you like repetitive electronic/dubstep, but even if you do there are only a few songs, so you can probably just get them without having to play this abomination.\nRating: 2.5\n\nExtras\nIf for god knows what reason you decide to complete this entire game, it might take you up to an hour and a half, and aside from that there is nothing else to do around since none of the levels are fun nor challenging to provide replay value and there are no achievements or leaderboards to reward you for actually putting through with this.\nRating: 1\n\nVerdict\nI honestly thought this was still part of Steam's Early Access programme since it feels unpolished, unfinished and pointless in its current stage, but that isn't the case since this game has been out for almost a year to date and there is still no reason for why someone would want to play this for more than five minutes.\nRating Overall: 1.8\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Dead Bits at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=326","March 28, 2015","false","1.8"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

And i would like to add, why is it so freacking shiny, boy does it tire the eyes quick. 6/10\n\nMusic - Now kudos to the Devs for getting original music by Frost Orb, and now the bad part. It is repetative, there are probably 2-3 songs in the whole game (there may be more, but that is all I heard). Ohh and the monsters you fight (zombie aliens) have only 1 sound file .. yea 4/10\n\nCinematics - 2 in the whole game, one for the start and one for the end. 2/10\n\nStory - You are here, peacefull, kidnap, do this to be free, finish doing it, you are free, end. 3/10\n\nContent - Not much, 9 levels, 3 weapons, 3 enemy variations, 3 bioms, and ... ohh wait, that is it. 2/10\n\nControls - Controls surprisingly good, but you can fall off ledges pretty easily, everything is slippery. 7/10\n\nGameplay - Well paced, having said that, you start the game knowing you have to finish the 9 levels, there is no build up through the 7 levels between the first and the last, and at the last there is the final boss. Other than that, solid shooting, don't know if having no recoil is bad or not, but hey it's good. 5/10\n\nWell the game does things right, and there are things it does really bad. I would suggest if you want to get the game for yourself or a friend, buy it when it is on sale,\n\nOverall Score: 4.1/10\n","July 16, 2015","false","3.4"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","12","12","3","0"

First, it has no rebindable keys. Not that the game has that many controls but it should be in any game, regardless of the complexity of controls. You can control your character with both WASD and the arrrow keys but you are still stuck with the rest. Second, the game simply doens't have much to offer. It has 9 short levels wich it calls Tests; Test 1, Test 2 etc. First, I thought they were just tutorials but they are the actual game. Really strange difficulty spikes too. Some levels are dead easy and over in the blink of an eye, others are frustratingly hard and you keep dying over and over again. The soundtrack is a hit or miss, depending on the fact if you like dubstep or not. You can't adjust the music volume. There is only a master volume slider. One last thing, if you suffer from slight motion sickness because of very narrow FOV's, this isn't your thing either. I had to stop playing after half an hour and left it open to collect the last trading cards.

The first one consists entirely of shooting a few block-zombies. The second stage features more block-zombies, and an additional gun. The stage after that? More block-zombies, and a bat. There's a stage where you don't get any weapons, and giant block-golems(?) take pot-shots at you with boulders. These aren't particularly interesting, well-balanced, or even fun gimmicks. They're more like those parts in your favorite games you always dread, but with slippery controls, worse platforming, and cheap deaths.\n\nNormally I'd write up a long list of ideas that could be implemented, for Dead Bits to approach some level of entertainment. However, I'm going to guess we're far beyond that point now. In fact, with this game I wouldn't even know where to start. Should I write that Dead Bits would be fantastic if it....was never made in the first place? That's not exactly constructive is it? Maybe I could say that it'd be great if this game was really unstable and crashed all the time, so then I wouldn't be able to play it. Hmm...I guess I better quit while I'm behind.\n\nDead Bits isn't the worst game I've ever played, It's probably not even in the top 100. I think that says more about me than anything. Aside from the all-important cards, this is not a game you would want to spend any time with.\n\nGotta admit though, I like the music.","December 19, 2014","false","1.2"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

It sucks.  0/5.\n\n-----\n\nThe worst thing about this game is that it sometimes forgets how much it sucks.\n\nDead Bits is a block-based first person shooter, which might seem a novel concept.  When I fired it up after hearing all the negative, I was pleasantly surprised that it actually ran.  Comparisons to Bubsy 3D were not right.  This game actually works.  It just sucks.\n\nThe first awkwardness is the intro to the levels, where you seem frozen in midair for a few seconds before dropping into a cube.  To actually play you have to jump down to the level.  But if you don't jump down right, you will fall and die.  In fact, the challenge of the game is not so much avoiding enemies as avoiding the crappy level design.\n\nThere is a nice touch for this kind of game, but not for a hardcore FPS, in that monsters have HP over their heads.  This is the only thing that makes Level 4 bearable.  But this doesn't make killing monsters any more easy or fun.  In Half-Life I can perfectly melee attack headcrab zombies, I can do great things with a sword in L4D2, I used to have a reputation of my skills with a lightsaber in the Jedi Knight games.  But this game's baseball bat weapon is hit or miss.  I take damage and don't even know why.  Which might not be the monster's fault, as I died in a corridor in level 2 for no reason once.  Something is very off there.\n\nThen when I play level 3, and there's a wave of zombies coming down the hall, and I have to whack them with a bat and I'm actually doing it, it's kind of satisfying.  Then the game turns gray and goes into slow-mo, and whatever timing I had is gone.  Just another poor design choice there. You see, when you kill a monster, there's a chance the game will turn gray and slow down to make it more dramatic, which unfortunately is not disimilar to what happens when you die.\n\nThe biggest problem for me, though, is that you cannot change key bindings.  Left-handed players are pretty much screwed.\n\nI can't help but feel there's an attempt at a game in here, but it's just not there.  The level design is what kills this game, more than anything.  Fortunately, there aren't that many levels, and they aren't that long.  I only managed to get through four of them before I gave up.","March 4, 2015","false","1.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

I would honestly rather play Superman 64 while somebody holds a shotgun to my jaw.\n\nThe gameplay is terrible.\n\nYou can beat the first 5 levels in under 10 minutes.\n\nNotice how I said first 5? Yeah, after level 5 the game becomes insanely difficult.\n\nLevel 6 is a fire level where you are completly unarmed for the entire mission until you reach the end using the game's horrible jumping physics, after which you get an SMG. Shortly after, a boss spawns with easy to destroy projectiles. And then he picks up speed to the point that it's impossible to dodge. By then he's sitting on top of you because you can't look straight up. If you DO manage to beat him, you get sent to level 7.\n\nLevel 7 is the last level I played before being 100% done with this game. You get the most inaccurate laser gun I've ever seen in a video game, an then your dropped on a narrow pathway with 2 UFOs with 1000 health EACH. After killing those you get sent to a Sonic the Hedgehog esque half-pipe like the special levels from Sonic 2. And there are little spiky things that insta-kill you if you touch them, making you go aaaaall the way back to the start. AND THEY'RE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID.\n\nThis game was not at all worth .14 cents.","December 21, 2014","false","0.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","10","13","5","0"

Yeah I know that the game doesnt call it 'pause' per say...regardless\nyou press the menu button and it freezes your mouse aiming. You can still strafe left and right, forward and back\nand Zombies can still attack you.\n\nSpeaking of ZOMBIES, WTF!\nSeriously, the game opens with you being abducted by aliens, and then suddenly: zombies...\nThere is an explanation to this... a very weak one mind you...\n\nSpeaking of Weak,\nThe First gun, the uzi, SMG thing, is a pea shooter. It is worthless. Id only recommend using it if you have no other option.\n\nThere is no ammunition, guns fire infinitely, which I think kills any depth or complexity this game may have.\nand there are jarring inconsistencies with the game's design.\n\nThe most notable being the starting platform.\nIt's textured and I guess it is supposed to resemble water. But everything else is just blocks.\nThere is the particle effect that marks the end of the level which is like a steam kind of effect, which is an outlineless gradient and clashes.  The bat is a chrome textured Cylinder again, it clashes with the block style of the game.\n\nThe fonts are a minor issue, but they too do not really gel with the design style.\n\nConvenyance is an issue.\n\nLet me ask,\n\nIf the goal is to kill all the enemies, why cant the level just end when I kill the enemies?\nThat would make more sense than walking to an arbitrary spot... Ill tell ya that much.\n\nWhy is it that in level 3, I dont have to kill all the enemies, but in seemingly every other level I do?\n\nWhy is the HP indicator just a number?\nI actually didnt notice any HP at all, and seeing as many FPS games go without Health guages I just assumed this was one of them.\n\nThe health packs look like red rubics cubes and do not indicate that they heal you. There isnt even a cliche white cross on it.\nThere isnt a pop up saying "Health restored" Nothing!\n\nCollision detection is buggy. Occasionally zombies seem to be able to hit me from quite far away.\nConversely, the Bat seems to be able to reach further than feels natural.\n\nTurning is a problem, the all green zombies which run at you can get into your blind spot and because you turn so slow\nthey can remain out of reach indefinitely\n\nThis game shouldnt be sold, and I say this without malice.\nThis is just extremely shoddy design and it isnt even comparable to many free titles you can find...\n\n","February 29","false","2.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Dead Bits is designed with the look of games like Mincraft, but there is no building, creativity, or any practical use for the cubes. It's actually a first person shooter with waves of zombies of three sizes. There are about three or four weapons that all feel exactly the same besides the one melee baseball bat weapon. When you kill a zombie they sometimes have a Killing Floor slow-mo effect. The world is built with holes in the ground as the one challenge in the game becuase if you fall you die. It literally feels like they just took random stuff from other games and quickly slapped them together just to say "here, there's some cool stuff in here".\n\nIn the end this entire game feels like a blatant student project being sold to help some people make a quick dollar from doing next to nothing. It takes no skill to play, has nothing new as gameplay mechanics, and requires no thinking. I only played it for as long as I did to prove this to myself and to finish getting the cards. I won't be selling the cards since I don't believe they deserve a dime until they add some quality content to this shallow game.\n\nThis is also one of those Greenlight games that asked for votes and offered a free key once greenlit. It's a horrible practice and it needs to stop. $4.99 is highway robbery for something anyone with no game experience could tinker around and make in Minecraft or any other simple sandbox or mod. I don't see anything in this game that requied talent to create.\n\nAlso note that the forum seems to be filled with people praising this game. When a user made a topic questioning this they were banned. I posted in the topic also questioning what was good about this game and was also banned from that forum. I can't say why this is, but I have my suspicions. Either way this is my review and I didn't enjoy this game. If anyone did I'd love to know how.","June 8, 2014","false","1.2"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","1"

I played through it in 3 hours. But this could be maybe 45-60 minutes, if there wouldn't be holes all over the map, and the machete (or waddyacallit ) wouldn't be so underpowered. It needs an almost perfect timing, or else you will get wounded by zombies. The 3 weapons are: P90, a shotgun (maybe spas-12) and a machete. The P90 is the best, because it fires rapidly, but has very low damage. I kinda liked the game until the 4th or 5th level. After that point the game changes to a trial and error like thing, because there are red and orange platforms, which kill you instantly. Oh and there are floating and spinning X-es, which ( surprise!!! ) kill you instantly. At the 8th level you can get into a spaceship and you have to survive 3 waves, but on the 3rd wave, the map gets covered in X-es, so if you fail, you have to try it again. Oh and the 9th level, which tries to change the game into a parkour stage, that's horrible, because the red and orange platforms are there, so one wrong step, and you are dead! There are 2 things, which I liked in the game: 1. It has only 9+2 levels. 2.: The soundtrack! The Soundtrack is the best in the whole game, but unfortunately you have to buy the game, before you can get the soundtrack.\n\nVERDICT: Dead Bits is a typical game, which could only get on Steam because of it's promotion. If you got it from BM 6 or WGN, you can give it a try, but it definitely doesn't worth 5 EUR/ bucks / pounds. 40/100","June 12, 2014","false","2.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Dead Bits is an FPS game where you shoot and hit zombie/alien things, that is it. You have a few weapons to chose from depending on the level, an SMG, Shotgun, bat or another weapon that I have yet to discover. The Gameplay is HORRIBLE. The guns are stupidly designed, for example, you can use a shotgun as a sniper rifle, the SMG is useless and the bat is strong, but you risk getting too close and 9/10 times you will get hit, well, as long as you keep moving backwards you will never get hit by melee-attacking enemies, though every level is set on blocky "islands" and you can easily fall off. Next, the enemy AI is so broken, you will constantly see enemies falling in pits, randomly floating and just being stuck in walls. Also the level design is BS, the first 2 levels are fine and actually kinda fun, but after that, you will have to try hard just to get past them, mainly because they have some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t atribute that makes them hard. Once you die in any level, you get set back at the LEVEL SELECT, that means that you will always have to reselect a level and wait for it to load, worst part is that you get set back at the start, so you can't make any mistakes. While this game is currently the biggest ♥♥♥♥ I have ever played, it does have some potential. The graphics style of cubes is actually pretty good and blowing up trees and seeing them fall is probably more fun that shooting enemies, though at the same time, some of the textures just look like from a poor TF2 map by some new designer, same with the level design. The level I liked the most is 2. It showed some potential of the game. The other levels are complete ♥♥♥ and I couldn't even get past the 4th one. All in all, this game is horrible, bad and one of the worst games to come out of Greenlight. I got this game from a promotion for free and thank god I didn't spend a single cent. I give it a 2/10 mainly because of the bad gameplay, horrible level desing and lack of content (seriously, 9 levels?) It also has dubstep as OST and (comming from a guy who absolutely hates dubstep) it was decent. Final verdic, stay away from it untill they either patch everything and add more content or you just wana see how bad it is for yourself","June 10, 2014","false","1.3"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borador/recommended/303390/","Borador","Borador","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borador/","372 products in account","Introduction\nDead Bits is a colorful first person shooter which features environments and enemies, which are made out blocks. It is about a creature named Quilly who is abducted by an alien and has to fight hoards of blocky enemies to regain his freedom.\n\nThe game features nine unique levels which all provide unique challenges. This may sound like if the game is a little bit short and it indeed is. I managed to finish everything in two hours and some people can certainly do it even faster. Although the levels lack in quantity, their quality makes up for it. Every level is very distinct from one another, so no level feels the same. Although they provide variety in challenges and difficulty, they are fairly linear, so there is no point in exploring them.\n\nThere are four weapons in this game, a submachine gun, a shotgun, a bat and an alien blaster. They come with unlimited ammunition and no reloads, but are otherwise pretty basic. Shooting is not the only thing you do in this game, though, there is also an emphasis on platforming. For the most part it handles pretty well and the levels are designed with that in mind, but sometimes the jumping can be slightly delayed and Quilly is unaffected by moving platforms so these have to be handled with caution.\n\nThe graphics are very simple by the nature of the pixelated blocks, it still looks fine though especially with added lighting effects on higher settings.\nThis game is accompanied by a dubstep soundtrack which cues in and out depending on level progression, and every level features one or more distinct songs.\n\nPros\n+  Nice difficulty curve\n+ Smooth and stable gameplay with no glitches\n+ Pretty lighting effects\n+ Very high variation in level themes\n+ Large soundtrack\n\nCons\n- Platforming can be a bit awkward\n- Very short\n- No pause feature\n- Linear level design\n\nConclusion\nDead Pixels is a basic game, which does nothing new in the FPS genre, but is crafted pretty competently, so that the gameplay is still enjoyable. With the low asking price of 0.99 USD in mind this game can be recommended for someone who wants a short distraction from life.\n\nRating: 6.5/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Golden Raffle Group, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games to F2P games.\n\nGame key provided by Microblast Games.","February 15","true","2.1"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","15","25","2","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/L-Z/recommended/303390/","L-Z","LeetZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/L-Z/","874 products in account","Ok... I am going to write a full-fledged "feature" review of this.\nTake note I played through all 9 tests (in 1.3 hours), and I got it from a bundle.\nLet's start with the good parts of the game, because this is going to be so much easier to list.\n\n-Awesome soundtrack; the dubstep fits the the game and the action well enough.\n-Environment variation for the most part; you will either be in forest, ice lands, hell, space and whatever going around doing various things, the level layout while pretty much linear is under no circumstance a corridor shooter for the most part.\n-The mini-games in test 7 and 8 give a welcomed change of pace.\n\nAand now for the underwater part of the glacier. I'll start with three arguments that will pretty much nullify the three ones above.\n\n-The soundtrack is repetitive; the same dubstep you will pretty much hear in all of the environments. There's barely any variation for the soundtrack whatsoever, which is dissapointing since what's there is nice.\n-The UFO level (test 8); it only throws hordes and hordes of enemies that you seen already at you, making everything just boring as tedious as you will just circle around the arena keeping your left mouse button pressed and hoping you hit anything.\n-Barely any hit confirmation; I have a hard time figuring out wether or not I hit a enemy, I can see that their health decreases in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ almost unreadable font (especially on hordes) but that's it, enemies never stutter, get knockback or anything. Knockback on the shotgun would've made sense would it not?\n-Level design; just like another guy said, Falling Simulator 2014. You will find out that you can easily fall of the maps. Even worse, die from blocks you didn't know that kill you (I had that issue from test 7 and up).\n-Extremely tedious and bad platforming; platforming in 3D has generally been a issue, but not always, it could be acceptable in arena shooters (would this be an arena shooter?) like this one, BUT it was screwed over completely by physically no mid-air control (why?) and the view lock to I suspect 80 degrees up and down. While looking up is mostly not necessary and it's just enough, looking down is a problem as you can't attack enemies straight underneath you (which would be a great tactic for those little zombies) BUT this also creates the issue that you can never know properly your exact position on the blocks. You need to go through intuition, which is bad enough already.\n-Extremely poor weapon design and functionality; there are a total of 4 weapons in the whole game. A UZI with a weird-♥♥♥ useless scope on-top, a shotgun (sniper) that looks like some paintball gun, a bat that I mistook as a machete due to the shader for half of the game and tests 7 and up, a plasma gun which is annoying as hell for reasons explained below. The weapon models are awkward in quality compared to the whole rest of the game, while being bad, they are still argruably better. Which is actually still bad since it creates inconsistency in general design.\n-Destroyed blocks have collision; and it's not minor, you can barely go through killed enemies or destroyable blocks and you just need to shoot them away or else, that is even more annoying when they just block your bullets, making the hordes of enemies a ton more annoying than they be. Additionally, the plasma gun creates blocks when it shoots anything, and since bullets can shoot blocks for collission and create more blocks, you essentially are able to give enemies a temporary shield wherever you hit them with the plasma gun, I had tons of instances in the last levels where I simply hit enemies with the plasma guns for about 2 seconds and they physically received no damage because I was simply hitting the blocks instead. That is plain dumb. Oh and enemies can go through destroyed blocks JUST fine.\n-Completely useleess zoom and crosshair; the crosshair is a spread crosshair, and by default definition and use in other games, it's supposed to define the accuracy (or non-accuracy) your gun will have. Well the weapons have physically no recoil, which is actually perfectly fine since it's sort of an arena shooter and recoil for something like this would actually be worse. BUT the weapons also have 100% accuracy. In fact you can give the same damage with the shotgun at a insane range as you give to a enemy next to you, making it more of a sniper with (somehow) some spread. Then there's the UZI which in fact NEVER has any spreads and will always hit perfectly in the center of the crosshair. This can barely be called a feature since those are things game developers avoided ever since I bloody know of. Don't put in useless features that can't even link properly together. Even worse, the range on the bat is so misguiding that you can barely tell which is that sweet spot range. Not to mention that you would never use the bat when you have another weapon as getting close to an enemy is a bad idea to begin with.\n-Inconsistency in level design; this is a minor aestethic issue, but, the game primarily seems to do a mix between voxel and 2000 3D level design by having both voxel cubes as a excuse for lazyness AND some rectangles rotated on every possible axis for whatever reason that just makes everything look bad.\n-Useless scoring system; you need to kill every enemy in order to advance to the next level, since that is the only way to get score, the scoring system is completely useless and serves no rewards, not even a high score table or self-gratification as the sole completion of a test will always yield the same score. At least for the most part, there was like one single test which allowed me to not kill one guy in order to advance, which would just essentially make my score like 100 less for the whole game. Oh no.\n-Space level is nauseous; playing on the space levels, alternative tests 7 and up has personally made me want to vomit.\n-No FoV slider; on a game like this the thing you'd want to do is cram that FoV slider up to max for a Quake-like experience so you don't feel nauseous. Do you have that? Nope.\n-Useless graphical settings; the game looks pretty horrible already, there's no texture or effects or particles that can redeem that fact in the current state, yet you have 4 graphical presets for whatever reason that do not explain or seem to do anything.\n-No checkpoints of any sort; test 9 manages to do 3 checkpoints by arena changing and that is completely fine and proves that the game had capability of doing so. This only seems ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as you can just finish a whole level then die from falling off the map thanks to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ level design.\n-No death variation; you get killed by zombies, the death screen shows you being eaten by zombies. Ok, cool, makes sense. You fall down the platform, you get eaten by zombies... what? You burn yourself in laval, you get eaten by zombies. You get smashed by a huge ball, you get eaten by zombies. This is pure laziness.\n-You are sent to the menu instantly on death; you don't receive option to restart or go back to the menu (or exit, uninstall the game and burn it), you are only sent to the menu and forced to wait about 5 seconds being eaten by zombies, 5 seconds till you can get in the level then 5 seconds to fall down in the most dull spawnpoint I ever seen.\n-Poor "end boss fight"; the game has a extremely dissapointing boss fight which barely explains anything (It took me 3 deaths even if I completed because I didn't know I also had to do one more thing to advance) which is just giving you the same enemy 3 times in a row each time just more powerful. Additionally it ends with what would look a choice for multiple endings but nope, the game chooses for you, which ends up with the game resulting being as linear as it can possible be, with no exploration benefits whatsoever and with no divergence in what you can do. It's always kill everything you see.\nMore in the comments of this review, as this is not all.","June 25, 2014","false","1.3"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","4"

There is no retry button, save for the last level, which restarts on it's own when you die.\n\nThere is a certain bit of trial an error in the game... The weapons are farily weak, yes. But it does add to the panic of the game... and some cheap deaths I mentioned above.\n\nThe level designs are pretty meh until you get to the 6th and 7th levels. Then they look really cool, but the platforming is still rough, 8th level is unique, 9th is a gauntlet. Be warned... the 5th level is super frustrating...\n\nThe soundtrack is awesome! I really enjoyed listening to it. Even when I was growling in frustration, the music (when it played) was entertaining and kept me somewhat involved.\n\nThis game is far from perfect.

The game swings between "Excessively easy" all the way down to "Impossibly difficult" seemingly randomly; There's no difficulty curve.\n\nThe controls are... Well, the best thing I can honestly say about them is that they WORK. There were a number of points where it felt like I just started dropping midway through a jump, but that could have been me.\n\nThe levels were uninspired and boring beyond belief; and the minimalist set design is evocative of Minecraft, but it just falls flat. More linear hallways and floating fields made of green, brown, and blue cubes, filled with enemies that move faster than you, hit harder than you, and don't ever stop moving.\n\nAnd after that, guess what? MORE linear hallways and floating fields! Sometimes there are white tunnels, too, but nobody cares about them.\n\nAll in all, don't.\n\nJust please.... Don't.\n\nI know it's cheap and you're thinking, "But hey! I might get SOME entertainment out of it" but I can almost guarantee that you WON'T. This is barely fit to be called a game and, quite honestly, shouldn't be on Steam in the first place.

And the time it took to develop this game is equal to how long the songs were in length. I mean dubstep is still pretty popular but you shouldn’t pick a game’s soundtrack based whats popular at the time.\n\nThe graphics tell me that the people who created this game lacked any means to model or texture anything besides the logos and GUI. Which also could mean… they didn’t( or don’t) know how to…? They also picked a really horrible font to use, you can see the horrible font, in all its glory, in the screenshots.\n\nThere is no aesthetics in the game that made it genuine or memorable to me. Could have tried harder. Like picking a nice color palette and being a little more abstract with level design.\n\nLastly the gameplay, It sucked, IT REALLY SUCKED! The user interface is extremely minimal and expects the player to not play long enough to care. You also cant configure it in the menu. The enemies are extremely simple and probably only took a couple of lines to program. The enemies have health bars, the thing that sounds nice on paper but only shows me how much the programmer(s?) cared about me. I can see the arbitrary numbers they used for the enemies and feel no sense of progression because of it.\n\nThis game rolled off steam GreenLight(Thanks, Gaben!)… And the only way I could image how this game made it on steam was manufactured votes from either bots or stupid people who were probably thinking, “Oh this game will never make it onto steam… voted and shared!”. Guess what. It made it to the storefront, jackasses!\n\nIf somebody bought you this game, unfriend them immediately. It might mean they don't care about you or your friendship. Otherwise if this was a joke gift, kick them in the gonads and cherish your friendship with an equally bad game gift.\n\nSteam, please remove this awful piece of garbage from the store.","February 20, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And the time it took to develop this game is equal to how long the songs were in length. I mean dubstep is still pretty popular but you shouldn’t pick a game’s soundtrack based whats popular at the time.\n\nThe graphics tell me that the people who created this game lacked any means to model or texture anything besides the logos and GUI. Which also could mean… they didn’t( or don’t) know how to…? They also picked a really horrible font to use, you can see the horrible font, in all its glory, in the screenshots.\n\nThere is no aesthetics in the game that made it genuine or memorable to me. Could have tried harder. Like picking a nice color palette and being a little more abstract with level design.\n\nLastly the gameplay, It sucked, IT REALLY SUCKED! The user interface is extremely minimal and expects the player to not play long enough to care. You also cant configure it in the menu. The enemies are extremely simple and probably only took a couple of lines to program. The enemies have health bars, the thing that sounds nice on paper but only shows me how much the programmer(s?) cared about me. I can see the arbitrary numbers they used for the enemies and feel no sense of progression because of it.\n\nThis game rolled off steam GreenLight(Thanks, Gaben!)… And the only way I could image how this game made it on steam was manufactured votes from either bots or stupid people who were probably thinking, “Oh this game will never make it onto steam… voted and shared!”. Guess what. It made it to the storefront, jackasses!\n\nIf somebody bought you this game, unfriend them immediately. It might mean they don't care about you or your friendship. Otherwise if this was a joke gift, kick them in the gonads and cherish your friendship with an equally bad game gift.\n\nSteam, please remove this awful piece of garbage from the store.","February 20, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The lack of time they spent on graphics should have been devoted to fixing any of the game's many faults that make it irritating and nearly unplayable. The laziness of the developers was most apparent when they copy and pasted so much of the "scenery" that they ended up creating an indoor horizontal waterfall with no start point.\n\nDead Bits' pathetic attempt at creating a FPS horror game also makes it less than ideal as a cheap gift for a kid, I wouldn't be surprised if more effort went into the death "cutscene" than the rest of the game put together.\n\nThe only point of playing this is for the value of the Steam Cards, and even then it's a stretch.\n0/10 I want my life back.","February 8, 2015","false","1.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It costs 0.14 € - so not much as it is in Sale. It wasn't boring and it was at one or the other point kind of challenging. During the Sale i would recommend this game because you can get 4 tradecards which are more worth than the game. That was only the financial aspect - now to the gameplay and plot. As you maybe read before there is no deep plot that is true, but in fact it is kind of a shooter and  are we really interested in "WHAT" we kill or "WHY" we kill it in a shooter? For me it is unimportant so the lack of story wasn't a con for me. But in fact it isnt just a shooter, it also has sequences of a platformer game in it and there I have a con, because some jumps wont work. I was near a platform and tried to jump, nothing happened, I look above but there was nothing.. so there are some invisible hitboxes of items which disable sometimes the jumo if you stand to near to it. That is in fact the only con I have on a 0.14€ game.\nBuy it, play it, enjoy it, beat it, make profit with it, delete it.\n\n8/10","December 28, 2014","true","1.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Once you leave the ground you can not turn in the air.\nThe levels are called Test #. Seriously.\nThe hitboxes for things such as trees seem to extend way beyond the tree itself which means you sometimes bump into one of these hitboxes at random.\nYou have infinite ammo and even though this is my personal opinion I think most people agree that this isn't a good way for the player to feel any slight challenge at all.\nWhen you fall down for the weird flying platforms you get some sort of cutscenes where the so called zombies are killing you, how did they get there?\nThe concept is very unoriginal and I'd go as far as to say that anyone with basic knowledge of game and software development could make a game similar to this.\nThere appears to be a whopping 9 levels in the game.\nThe overall physics engine seems both floaty and static at times and it makes the game very unfun.\nThere are no hints in game that tell you anything about your objective or how to actually finish the level when you have killed off all the zombies.\nZombies are such an overused game concept.\nThe game gets very frustrating as you often fall off the face of the earth and have to start the 'test level' over again.\nIf this game is a finished product then why the hell would the levels be called 'Test #' anyways??\n\nIf you like unfinished and wonky piece of ♥♥♥♥ games with overused concepts, go ahead and buy it.

Utterly good.\n\nI must admit it, it's very short: there are only nine levels, and once you complete them the game is over. There are no achievement to keep you playing a little... Things like complete every level in order without dying even once.\nFurthermore, the difficulty swings between excessively easy to quite hard, depending by the level and other factors.\nOnly three weapons, and when you can choose which you want to use, the machinegun turns out to be the best one, most efficient and the one with the best feedback. The baseball bat... it's a melee weapon, hence you'll find it having its inherent downsides, along with a low speed; Nonetheless, I found the shotgun having the same, discouraging, rate of fire.\n\nBut forget all these things! There are flaws, undoubtedly, but the bright colours and the happy dubstep soundtrack will surely let you enjoy the little trip among the twists and turns that this game has to offer. It will be a short ride, but intense and original.\nWhile you will find yourself unable to change almost any settings, but it doesn't matter; this is a game that has to be taken as we used to approach those Insert Coin games, which entertained ourselves for several hours in the arcade rooms.\n\nDo not expec a masterpiece. Expect something that feels not even Beta Access, but Alpha Build, regardless, I recommend you this purchase: if you're going to pay it less than a burger, then it's definitely worth the purchase!\n\nIf you need ratings\n\nGrapich: 6\nSound: 6\nLongevity: 2\nGameplay: 6\n\nOverall: 5/10\n\nAs someone who dislikes the dubstep, I'm in love with its soundtrack.

It features simple k/m controls (WASD, Space, and M1/M2). It's really that basic. However, as you advance, the platforms tend to fall away behind you, so strategic retreats become quite limited without you falling to your death. It uses a basic point health system...you have 100, the creatures tend to have more. The game actually looks pretty cool, and the gameplay such as it is works perfectly. I have encountered no bugs or the like.

Basta.\n\nIl fatto che sia a cubi già fa' capire che serve ad attrarre i bambini che vengono da Minecraft.\n\nPoi, la musica ogni tanto si ferma casualmente (perchè?), le munizioni sono infinite... Cribbio, almeno metti che i nemici droppano munizioni o che hai una barra del surriscaldamento, se no si puo' comodamente spammare da 10 km per uccidere.\n\nAltra cosa...

Nothing more.\n\nThe graphic is like Minecraft (cubes) and this enough to understand that this game is for kids who comes from Minecraft.\n\nSometimes the music randomly stop (why???), there's no clip and no ammo, so you can spam how much you what...\nGood god, put that enemy drop ammo after they get killed or something like an hover-heating bar...\n\nLast but not least, why you need to connect to a server to play? (you can see this by pressing ESC, and see the enemy that still moves).\n\nWhy you need to wait 5 seconds before fall into the platforms?\n\nWhy sometimes when you jump there's a wind coming from... ??? and push you to the other part of the mas letting you die?\n\nIt is good if you buy it for like 0.15€-0.20€ and sell the cards you drop at like 0.15€ and get some profit...\n\nThis game is good for like 30-40 minutes...

It's hard to understand how this got through the Greenlight program. First of all the graphics are ugly. I don't know if they were attempting a simple look with the boxy models like Minecraft, but there is no thought put into how things are modeled with the boxes or textured.\n\nInstead of attempting to fix very simple problems like enemies being placed too close to a high ledge they can't reach and hit you on the developer just set a wall there with a pop-up message that says "nice try! jump down!" Which had to be more work than simply moving the enemies to a place where they couldn't be fired upon from that vantage point.\n\nI was almost convinced it was an illusion, but I genuinely think simply looking at the ground for some reason slows down your character. That's the kind of weird misunderstanding of basic long established mechanics this game gets wrong.\n\nThere are only 9 levels and most of your play time will just be spent trying to cope with the bad control and poorly mapped out levels. This game plays like something developed by someone who hasn't played a game since the Nintendo 64. That isn't bashing on the 64, I mean to literally say they forgot what a video game is since they haven't actually played one since the 90s.\n\nThe only good idea in this game is the random contrived slowmotion that makes it easier to cope with the bad shooting mechanics sometimes.","December 27, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It feels like it was made by a 12-year-old as a project to teach themselves how to program.\n\nCons:\n- Extremely primitive block-style graphics that nonetheless manage to make the game run badly on the highest quality setting on a fairly recent laptop. The way this thing looks, it should run smoothly on the first Voodoo card.\n- Extremely primitive level design which consists of irregular platforms floating in the sky. Good luck trying to circle-strafe enemies without falling to your death over and over again.\n- No way to save your progress. When you die, and you will, a lot (see above point), you get to load the level again and start from the beginning. You also get to wait through annoying pauses each time this happens.\n- No way to adjust anything other than three levels of graphical quality and windowed vs. fullscreen mode. Not even the controls.\n\nPros:\nLOL there are none\n\nConclusion:\nThis is not only not worth paying for, it's not worth being paid to play.","January 7, 2015","false","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Utterly good.\n\nI must admit it, it's very short: there are only nine levels, and once you complete them the game is over. There are no achievement to keep you playing a little... Things like complete every level in order without dying even once.\nFurthermore, the difficulty swings between excessively easy to quite hard, depending by the level and other factors.\nOnly three weapons, and when you can choose which you want to use, the machinegun turns out to be the best one, most efficient and the one with the best feedback. The baseball bat... it's a melee weapon, hence you'll find it having its inherent downsides, along with a low speed; Nonetheless, I found the shotgun having the same, discouraging, rate of fire.\n\nBut forget all these things! There are flaws, undoubtedly, but the bright colours and the happy dubstep soundtrack will surely let you enjoy the little trip among the twists and turns that this game has to offer. It will be a short ride, but intense and original.\nWhile you will find yourself unable to change almost any settings, but it doesn't matter; this is a game that has to be taken as we used to approach those Insert Coin games, which entertained ourselves for several hours in the arcade rooms.\n\nDo not expec a masterpiece. Expect something that feels not even Beta Access, but Alpha Build, regardless, I recommend you this purchase: if you're going to pay it less than a burger, then it's definitely worth the purchase!\n\nIf you need ratings\n\nGraphics: 10\nSound: 8\nLongevity: 7\nGameplay: 10\n\nOverall: 9/10\n\nAs someone who dislikes the dubstep, I'm in love with its soundtrack. It's surprisingly fitting for this terrible game.\nBuy it if you can appreciate simplistic games.\nAnd this game is better than CoD:Ghosts\n","January 7, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At best, it is a proof of concept or a tech-demo; and, at worst, someone's school project, consisting of 9 random levels that take less than an hour to complete. Monsters often spawn on top of the player, leaving no room to maneuver and dodge their attacks. "Platforming" mostly consists of bunny-hopping across haphazardly strewn platforms, some of which are right on top of each other, while others are so far apart that the character barely makes the jump, and trying to figure out whether a particular orange-looking platform is safe, or whether it is "lava". While technologically Dead Bits has the potential to be shaped into a game, in its current state it suffers from a lack of design, or even conscious thought.","January 7, 2015","false","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/James_Boxers/recommended/303390/","James_Boxers","James Boxers","http://steamcommunity.com/id/James_Boxers/","687 products in account","It's not a horrible game, but finding it on Steam and it's retail price, that's asking for too much.\n\nThis game would have been a good few minute time killer to avoid finger tapping, but it wasn't much more than that. I'd expect to see a game such as this on Newgrounds or any other flash game site, maybe even facebook. I'll begin with a general pro/con list then detail the good and bad to each test.\n\nPros:\n+I bought it for $0.14 while it was on the Steam sale\n+It did manage to create at least two "startling" scenarios, simply because of enemies appearing in close range with no prior warning, jump-scare if you will\n+Some levels kept a focus between platforming and shooting\n+The weapons each have unique functions: machine gun, shotgun, melee, explosive\n+Weapons are introduced individually to give you a feel for their function\n+The levels are generated exactly the same every time, so you'll know exactly where everything is/spawns if you should die or replay the level.\n\nCons:\n-Retail price is 5 dollars\n-At any point if there is a possible advantage of terrain or shortcut, the game finds a way of nullifying that with either flying AI or invisible walls that you may see too late\n-There is a "bloom" in the crosshair, but any movement, continuous fire, or jumping does nothing to affect your accuracy. Your accuracy is always 100% no matter the condition.\n-Crouching does nothing to help you, with 100% accuracy, fast moving enemies, and projectiles mostly in hip range, crouching doesn't provide any advantage.\n-Enemies shatter into blocks. Anything too large of a block of that enemy will usually physically impede your movements when you collide with it. This becomes irritating when strafing suddenly comes to a stop because the block is on the ground nearby.\n-Any moving platform does not physically move you. This would be fine if all the rotating platforms were all either irregular shaped or squares. This leads to the point where if you're too close to the edge, the second the blocks under your feet become space, you fall, typically to your death.\n-Death starts the entire level over, and in most cases having prior knowledge of what's upcoming does nothing to help you progress faster simply because of the grind to kill enemies.\n-The enemy AI pathing is both good and bad. It can follow the blocks presented to make a path to you, but sometimes it ignores "space" and walks over the air to reach you. They also may find themselves hung up on walls. And I mean literally as well, sideways on the wall stuck.\n-Jumping has a commited jump arc. If anyone remembers the NES games of Castlevania, it's like that. It is exactly like that, buy a wedding ring for that jump because you're stuck with your jump direction til death do you part.\n-The game does a terrible job of explaining your environment and how it interacts with you. Several instances will lead to your death. You'll find yourself doing a trail and error with the game's environment if you see something you haven't seen before.\n-The levels are exactly the same down to enemy generation, it provides no replayability.\n-The game fails to follow a flow, each level is drastically different in what you just played. The only thing that follows, if it does, is just reskinned enemies.\n-The slow-motion does not follow your mouse movement and just interferes with your game. If you spin the mouse to fast, your character will turn back and forth between opposite directions because the mouse speed forced in slow-mo can't follow your mouse position. Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne had a function for using slow-mo as an advantage. One Finger Death Punch added slow-mo for flair, but it gave you a break and prevented interfering with the game by not allowing enemies to be within reach during tha time. Dead Bits scripted slow-mo on certain enemies or cues, whether you like it or not.\n-Dubstep. It would be fine if the creator of the dubstep didn't also thin himself out to make everything else in the game.\n-Music is not consistent throughout the game. You'll play in complete silence sometimes then the music kicks on "cues". Then at other points the music just leaves entirely if playing for too long on one segment.\n-There is no pausing the game, you just open the menu and the game continues.\n\nSadly due to character limit, I cannot go into detail on each level, but I'll leave the first two here as example.\n\nTest 1\n+Introduces machine gun, shoots bullets\n+Introduces you can't shoot outside of starting box\n+Shows basic enemy\n+Shows how they interact when near you\n+Cool slow-mo show at the end of the level\n+Lets you determine how to find the exit to a level based on the only change in the level\n-Doesn't let you fall off the level, you die if you fall off any other level\n-An entire test is given with no instruction but you just instinctively shoot at zombie looking things because you've played a zombie game before\n-You can shoot the trees, but it does nothing\n-That shrilling sound at the start of the level will be the sound you hear at the start of every level from now on\n-That number on the bottom is your health, but it's only a number with no indication unless you see that the enemies attacking you and seeing that number decrease are relatable\n\nTest 2\n+Introduces shotgun\n+First test of weapon switching\n+First test to introduce platforming\n+First test to show you the destruction of trees as well as how destructable environments can also prevent enemy advancement\n+Enemies can come in different sizes shown in this level\n+Further proves killing all enemies is needed to progress\n-You can die immediately after starting the test by simply missing the jump down\n-First instance of enemies walking over space to pursue you\n-The tree hitboxes are giant prisms, they do not possess a detailed hitbox\n-You begin to understand that the enemies' death blocks can block your way\n-That spinning platform at the end, it is possible to die just before exiting if you fall between the small gap of the block and the end of the tunnel\n-Music leaves mid-level because you've left the starting 5 zombie rush\n\n\nAgain, it's not a bad game, it's just asking for too much and I felt the developer spread himself too thin on a pretty nice idea. There are some bad concepts to it but also some good ones. I'm mixed, but the only way I could recommend this game is for the 14 cent sale price. At least then you could get your money back selling the cards.","December 25, 2014","false","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The cinematics are comparable of those to, hmm, it makes me contemplate as the utter graphical surpremacy is more advanced to any other game of this time.\n\nThe story, I say, is as well thrilling, gripping, and intuitive. Follow the tragic tale of an innocent boy (I'm assuming, as he seems young and agile, Haha!) who, one peaceful evening, gets kidnapped by a dirty scoundrel by the identity of Quanton. I presume Quanton is some technologically superior being, with hovering vehicles (which by the way, look exponentially better than any sci-fi game before), countless types of minions, and numerous high quality tests, all personally for his entertainment.\n\nThis masterpiece of modern and historical culture should be many times more expensive, as a dollar can not capture this... this... perfection. The ending was, as many say, "dumb" but I found it captivating. Quilly, after overcoming all tests, faces Quanton. As the duel wages in an epic 3 part level, Quilly finds it in himself to become Questionable Quilly, which is a form of Quilly that asks questions, such as: Why are you reading this? Why aren't you buying millions of copies of this game? Why are you still reading this? Why is the intro narrated like a 4 year old? Why are my eyes so hideous and ugly?\n\n5/10\nPros:\n-semi-decent music\n-laughs from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ness of this game\n-5 minutes of gameplay\n\nCons:\n-graphics\n-weapons\n-everything else\n\nStill good if your looking to make a few cents in profit.","December 29, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Its not the graphics and its not the music, nor in a way the game itself.\n\nIts very easy to die in this game, infact its very easy to die several times before you even actualy start the level, and thats fine however the lack of a quick restart makes this very annoying, each time you dies haveing to go through the death fmv, back to the level select and loading up the level again. Haveing to sometimes do this 2 or 3 times before even starting the level can be very frustrating, esp as the levels are getting longer and longer.\n\nThe levels are very narrow either with walls or death drop and the mobs are very large in relation to the world, the so far every level has you starting by dropping into the world being swarmed by 5+ mobs and you have no where to go but a drop death or blast through and hope you don't fall.\n\nWeapons are odd, the guns being unlimited ammo with no reload required. The MG needing lots of bullets to kill something, the shotgun needing 2 and yet a lead pipe needing only 1 hit.\n\nEven if you thrive on challanging games and do not mind repetition ( I don't mind replaing games or levels for chevos but this is something else ) I assure you that this game will push you over the edge, I must have spent nearly as much time playing as reloading from death.\n\nWarning watching the game intro will result in an epileptic fit, its tantamount to sitting in a room full of strobe lights with your eyes taped open.","December 30, 2014","false","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I honestly didn't expect much going into a game with a 'mixed' User Reviews and amazingly I was surprised... the game was worster than I anticipated.\n\nThere is minimal story. Basically, you are abducted by aliens and forced to under go various 'test levels' in order to escape. No story is played before each level, so you don't really know what's really going on.\n\nGraphics are poor. The weapon models aren't good (they just don't look right). Textures for all models (weapons, terrain, enemies) lack detail. Animations for both your guns and enemy attacks look clunky.\n\nGameplay is a mess. The aim of the game is to defeat all enemies and then escape via a portal at the end. In order to reach the end, you have to face off against a variety of zombies which each have unique health and speed stats. To assist you against such foes, most levels provide you with a weapon which include a bat, smg or shotgun (only 3). Weapons don't have ammo and can be fired constantly with minimum consequences. There is also a platforming element to the game which isn't well implemented due to level design issues. Basically, there are alot of holes in the platforms which basically lead to death. There are no check points in the game, so after each death you will have to watch the game over screen and start from the very beggining of the level. The result is frustration, as you have waste all that time for no progress and will have to spend more time just to get back to where you were before. There is also no snese of achievement, no reward for defeating enemies and finishing off a level which removes the drive to complete this game, making it a chore to complete rather than being fun.\n\nLevel design is atrocious. As mentioned previously, the holes in the platforms make it annoying to move around as you can easily fall to your death. A further problem is when you are rushed by a group of enemies and forced to juggle between your foes and the environment. There is little room to manouvre (making it extremely linear), making combat more challenging than it needs to be.\n\nMusic is decent. A techno track is played during the game, which fits quite well. Weapon sounds are poor and lack quality. Footstep sounds are strange as well. There is no voice acting.\n\n\nIf you want steam trading cards, wait for a sale to get this game. Else, stay far away.\n\n\n","April 14, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Now without criticizing the graphics the music is trash. I mean dubstep can be okay but this is like some kid recorded the tracks on his computer and thought it sounded good. The level design looks like you threw a bunch of blocks into a blender and dumped out a design for a level. I think the main problem was not the difficulty, but how the game throws groups of enemies at you with out any warning. The hardest level in the game is "Test 6" , the boss glitches out and starts throwing balls at you from everywhere, sometimes even above you, and you cant aim above your character so you just get pelted with balls. Level 9 was actually three levels in one which was actually fair and made more sense because it felt like you actually had checkpoints and made progress. I'm really not trying to rant about the artificial difficulty but thats what it is, Its not hard, it's just unfair. Another problem is the random slow-mo trat occurs after killing set enemies in the levels. It's so annoying when you're fighting a group of enemies and then the games slows down and blairs dubstep in my ears. Maybe if you could lower the games music volume, but they didn't give an option to lower the music in the game unless you go to your sound mixer on your desktop. These petty problems alone annoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. Every game should have sound options but when there isnt it is so anooying and off throwing that I really just get fed up with the game right away. Without talking about how bad everything is I actually had fun on the Ice level ("Test 5" I think it was) it was so fun honestly. It felt like something new and it looked alright. The level was pretty easy, which was dissapointing because that was the only level I enjoyed. Maybe if you copied the idea for that level and made more similar to that, you could have some quality levels or something. When it comes down to it though, this game just isn't worth it. Even when I spent $0.14 on the game, it wasn't worth it. I beat the game I promise you that for $0.99 (Not on sale) you could buy 3 better games than this. Please for the love of everything that is good, DO NOT BUY THIS ATROCIOUS ABORTION OF A GAME!!!","January 2, 2015","false","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I hate 2D/pixel "art," but I like what's in Dead Bits (probably because the weapons don't look half bad (dat chrome bat doe)) - the water is one of the best things (so simplistic, such nice). The slow-mo a la Killing Floor is hit-or-miss. If you've got the mouse down pat, it'll be awesome. If you feel as though excessive mouse acceleration or something is in the game while just walking, it will be one of the things that kills you most.\nSpeaking of the mouse, the head-bob and whatnot makes it seem as though your character moves more realistically than one would expect. Due to the weird controls, I can't dig it.\n\nAgain, good idea. Though not original, I can appreciate that an attempt was made. That's just it though - it seems not much thought was put into the actual design. I am not raging just to rage - I can only hope (I do assume) that, what with Microblast Games trying to push another project through Greenlight, they've taken to heart all the criticisms within these Mixed reviews. I would say to vote Yes on Particula and see what improvements they have made towards polishing their games, because Dead Bits isn't actually as abyssmal as some reviews (mine included) make it out to be, if you can hack it...","December 19, 2014","false","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SonicTWDKenny/recommended/303390/","SonicTWDKenny","TWD Kenny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SonicTWDKenny/","205 products in account","Honestly, I'd give this game a meh or a sideways thumb, but I honestly think it falls a little more under the thumbs down catagory rather than the thumbs up catagory. This game is more of a rage game than a happy, fun, shoot-em-up kid game. Even though you can tell this is definitely centered towards kids, this really isn't as fun as you'd think it is. You can tell it's towards kids because 1. Dubstep (that's it's ONLY soundtrack) 2. Simple, blocky textures 3. It's an FPS recreation of Minecraft.\n\nGameplay\nIt's exactly as you'd think- an FPS version of Minecraft. Nothing against the developers, but this type of gameplay is getting stale. I'm honestly surprised there weren't any COD weapons put in this game, considering how cliche it is.\n\nStory\nThe story isn't really that original and is very forgetful. You start the game where your protagonist is sitting on his porch and is abducted by aliens and is forced to do these tasks to earn his freedom again. So basically, he just enslaved him. I say it's forgetful because damn, I really forgot I was captured by aliens while fighting off these Ice enemies shooting gigantic snow balls at me. True story, it's in level 5.\n\nGameplay Mechanics\nThe mechanics aren't exactly great in this game either. The developers chose not to go with checkpoints- which I think is a stupid idea. Without checkpoints, you are forced to restart the entire level if you die and quite frankly, dying is pretty common. Lots of the times, I'll get really far into the mission and then accidently fall off the edge of the platform I'm walking on and die, forcing me to restart the entire mission. This brings me to my next topic- enemies and how ♥♥♥♥ing overpowered they are.\n\nEnemy Mechanics\nNo matter which enemy you are fighting, 1 hit will always take away 12 HP and you only have 100 HP. The enemy AI is programmed to kill you with no cost whatsoever, and so your enemies will hunt you down until they kill you or you kill them. Killing enemies aren't hard at all, but when they stack up and you're against 3 or 4 enemies at once, they can kill you within seconds.\n\nFrame Rates\nFinally, something good I can talk about. Frame rates are very smooth and do not drop below 50 FPS. This makes things a lot smoother and more easy to play.\n\nConclusion\nOverall, I didn't have much fun with this game. It'd be a LOT better if they fixed jumping lengths (because on level 5, I died so many times just trying to get from spawn up to the giant ice enemy), added in multiplayer (both online and local), fixed enemy damage values, and maybe changed their gameplay a bit. I hate to bash on these developers because their game isn't really that bad, they just need some fine tuning before I'd call it a full retail game. 5/10","May 27, 2015","false","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This engagement soon runs dry in its flavor, and I find myself thinking that it's time to play a browser based flash game, but for but a moment, dead bits does achieve an innocent charm.

You might ask, "Why is this game worth my 99 cents when it looks so bad???" I have the answer for you right here.\n\nZombies. Dubstep. Random slow-mo effects. Graphics of a Roblox game.\n\nThe AI alone has blown me away with the fact that they actually go after you. If you go towards them, they walk towards you! Revolutionary!\n\nThe soundtrack has kept me around for awhile. I decided to buy the seperate soundtrack because the 1 dubstep song featured in every single level is just too good to only hear for 9 levels in a row. Check the Top 40 charts, it should be there somewhere.\n\nThe non-stop action of this game kept me biting my nails and hanging on the edge of my seat for the 15 minutes of playtime I got! Random slow-mo effects after kills that waste your time will blow. you. away. It's as if you're immersed in the action without even needing an Oculus Rift. Truly mindblowing.\n\nThe graphics are simply beautiful. They're lego-like, and you can't get enough without longing for your childhood. You'll begin to miss the smell of your soiled undergarments by the time you're two levels in. This game rivals the graphics of the HD game, Roblox! Dead Bits truly shoves all competition aside!\n\nOverall, I would I would give this game a 5/5.

While amateurish, the developer clearly had at least a basic grasp of game design, and there was a lot of variety in the challenges. It wasn't a straight-up FPS, it was sometimes a platformer, sometimes an FPS, and sometimes a "hit-things-with-a-bat game". It combined all of them at certain points too, which I think is where it really shined.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't finish it. The game is rather difficult, in spite of the simplistic AI, mostly due to the challenges being laid out like an endurance gauntlet. Now, I like gauntles, they're fun, but the stages are pretty long and there's a distinct lack of checkpoints. After retrying the sixth stage around four times, I just couldn't be bothered to run through again. The amateurish game design and intentionally harrowing first person platforming are tolerable and even enjoyable at first, but on repeat runs they become annoyances. It's a real shame, too, because with even a semi-generous checkpoint system, I would've had a pretty good time.","June 11, 2015","false","3.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There's an immediate sense of desolation when you start playing. As if waking from a dream of hope and anticipation and being bludgeoned concious by the harsh reality that those screenshots you see up there are the cream of the crop. It's fun in the way of "can I make this jump without falling" and "how many badly rendered enemies can I destroy". This engagement soon runs dry in its flavor, and I find myself thinking that it's time to play a browser based flash game, but for but a moment, dead bits does achieve an innocent charm. It's not painful to play nor is it graphically distasteful... it just lacks ambiant content and personality depth.","March 21","true","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

If you have it already, then you can at least get some of your money back with the cards. I see what they were going for, an arcade shooter, but this just is not fun. Not only do the enemies tend to change speed depending on your playthrough of a particular level, but the difficulty is all over the place. Then there's the lava, another insta-kill obstacal in a setting where you can wander off the edge of the level for insta-death, or fall through a hole in the level for insta-death. No checkpoints either.\n\nMade it to "test 6" before I started thinking about "What am I willing to put up with?"

So like any other person, I was suprised and happy. Shortly after, I started growing fur. Then, my knees started to get inverted and my feet started to grow. after that, my face started to extend and my ears grew. All of these growing proccesses continued for a couple of years until I realized I had transformed into a kangaroo. A few months after the transformation, that no one accepted my true form, the form i was destined to live. How could anyone descriminate and ridicule MY true form. It may have looked so wrong but it felt so good. It didnt take me long to realize that I didnt belong in society. So I migrated from my hometown to Ausralia to thrive, be accepted, and be happy. So here I am now, living with my family, my true family, in the outback. If this life-changing game didnt exist, id be a lonely kangaroo that has nowhere to run, no one to turn to.

It sprung onto the NES scene in 1987, and it was a runaway success. Remember the chip shortages that delayed the 1988 release of the Adventure of Dead Bits? Or what about the first time you saw pictures of the Japanese version of 1991's A Dead to the Bits? With the possible exception of Mario, no Nintendo series has caused such a level of hysteria or left behind so many great memories. Dead Bits definitely follows in the footsteps of the previous games, and the result is a game that can't be called anything other than flawless.\n\nYou begin the game as a child of the forest. But by the time you're done, you'll be a fisherman, an errand boy, the hero of time, and, yes, even a traveling mask salesman. The game is chock-full of minitasks and subgames that run alongside the main quest, saving Hyrule from Ganondorf's evil. This leads to an extreme feeling of freedom, even though a good portion of the game must be executed in a linear fashion. Stuck at the water temple? Then why not go scout around for some extra heart containers while you think about your dilemma?\n\nThe control really holds the game together. Most 3D game designers still haven't mastered the art of controlling characters in a 3D environment, but that's not the case here. Link moves beautifully, and controlling his various actions is a breeze. Essentially, your B button will always attack with the sword. The A button, however, acts as an action button, performing every non-item-related task in the game. At various times, A lets you climb, grab, dive, talk, and lots more. Three of the C buttons are used for items, any of which can be assigned to any of the three buttons. The top C button zooms in to a first-person perspective, which allows you to look around. The R shoulder button is used for blocking with the shield. The Z trigger is perhaps the most important button when it comes to dealing with enemies in the 3D realm. Hitting Z while looking at an enemy will cause you to lock on to that opponent. From there you can circle-strafe around them, hop from side to side, and always block in their direction. This is key to fighting all but the most basic of enemies and is extremely well conceived.\n\nWhile there are some tough monsters, the main enemy in Dead Bits is the puzzle aspect of the game. Dead Bits forces you to think before you act, with numerous puzzles spread throughout the entire game. Some puzzles must be solved simply to exit a room, while other, larger puzzles sometimes cover an entire area. Some of the game's puzzles are totally optional, usually rewarding you with a piece of a heart container - which you'll need, but you won't have to collect every single one as long as you're quick with the Master Sword.The game's items are the usual assortment you've come to expect from a Dead Bits game. The boomerang is an invaluable tool for young Link, as is the slingshot. These weapons are mere toys for Link's adult body, however, so you'll be using the bow and the hookshot (or grappling hook) for most of the game's latter portions. Bombs, of course, come in handy no matter how old you are. The ocarina is probably the most-used item in the game. Throughout the entire game, you'll learn various tunes for the ocarina. Playing these tunes does a lot of different things, such as turning night to day, opening certain doors, calling your horse, and warping from place to place. In a world as large as Hyrule, warping is an extremely useful time-saver.\n\nTime plays an important role throughout the game. As you proceed, time passes, and day quickly becomes night. At night, the fields of Hyrule can be a dangerous place. Time travel also comes into play, allowing you to jump seven years into the future and back again. The two times act similarly to the light and dark worlds in the SNES Dead Bits game, A Dead to the Bits. Things you do as a child will affect locations, and a few puzzles require the use of both time periods.\n\nGraphically, Dead Bits is simply unmatched. Everything about the game just looks fantastic. You can see Death Mountain in the background of some portions of the game, complete with various smoke effects depending on what stage of the game you're in. The cinematics, which, of course, use the game engine, look absolutely spectacular, and the effects used (the time travel sequence is especially sweet looking) really give the game a spectacularly majestic look. The game's sound is also really quite amazing. Every tune in the game perfectly relates to the onscreen action. Even the songs you play on the ocarina are hummable. The sound effects are also perfect. The speech consists of mostly laughter, gasps, and battle yelps (heavy on the "hi-yah!") and works very, very well. The game also takes your location into consideration. Dungeons and large canyons sound appropriately echoey, while underwater, noises are nice and warbled.\n\nIn a way, Dead Bits is a textbook example of retro done right. It manages to combine small aspects from all the previous Dead Bits games, giving you the same Dead Bits feel but in an entirely new way. Even in its huge, fiercely 3D world, the game retains a truly classic feel. This is a sequel at its finest, expanding on previous themes and bringing plenty of new stuff to the table.\n\nEven if you're specifically looking for it, it's hard to find fault in Dead Bits. OK, to be fair, there's a slight bit of slowdown in a couple locations, such as the water temple, but it isn't frequent or harmful enough to even matter. The game offers a nice challenge, a stunningly well-told story, and the gameplay to back it all up. This game is the real thing. This is the masterpiece that people will still be talking about ten years down the road.

Dead Bits is a simplistic FPS shooter featuring a creature named Quilly who has been abducted by some aliens while he was sleeping and now has to fight for his freedom . Everything is made out of blocks, so the graphics are simple, but colorful and have lighting effects, so they look pretty nice. The games has 9 levels, each one of them coming with unique challenge, graphics and the soundtrack also differs from one level to another and changes as you progress, it takes around 2 hours to finish the whole games since the levels are kind of challenging, some might even find them hard. The level design is not poor, but very linear and you're unable to explore the surroundings, you just have to looks forward and fight the enemies until the level is over. The games doesn't have a pause menu, so there's no restart level option, I am not sure if this has been intentionally not added, but would make sense since you also don't have to reload the weapons, they have infinite ammo. These 2 things make the gameplay intense. Speaking of weapons, there are five weapons: a shotgun, a rifle, a bat like thing which looks like an icicle to me, an alien blaster an a paint gun. The soundtrack is not bad at all, I am into dubstep, but I really liked it. I highly suggest trying out the Dead Bits Soundtrack DLC, trust me, it will enhance your experience.\n\nTL;DR : Prons and Cons + my final verdict	Pros	Cons	+ Challenging and intense gameplay, some might even find it difficult.\n\n+ Awesome soundtrack that differs from one level to another and changes as you progress. Buying the Dead Bits Soundtrack DLC will enhance your experience even more.\n\n+ Everything is made out of cubes, the graphic style is simple, but colorful and has lighting effects, so the graphics look pretty nice.\n\n+ The games has 9 levels, each one of them coming with a unique challenge, graphics and the soundtrack also differs from one level to another as stated above.	- The level design is linear and does not allow the player to explore surroundings.\n\n- It's pretty short, but the thing that the levels are challenging almost compensates it.\n\n- Does not have a pause menu, it's true that this might have not been added on purpose to make the gameplay more intense, but adding it could certainly please a lot of people, it also has no checkpoints.\nFinal verdict:  7.5/10\nThis game is a gem for its 1 € price, but you've probably gotten it for free :^).  Whatsoever, you should definitely give this short and simplistic FPS game a try if you have 2-3 spare hours!","February 22","true","2.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","2"

Friends, do yourself a favour, most of you should have Steam trading cards in your inventory just sitting there. Sell two of them on the community market for 7 cents each. That's all it takes to get this game!\n\nI feel like the game developer Rafael Capelini Carminatti deserves support. At first I thought that maybe he may have been one of the many greenlight devs that just want to cash in. But after playing Particula which is a 3 player co-op tower defence game that he also made. It's pretty clear that although his games appear simplistic, he understands gameplay design and is experimental with the game engine.\n\nDead Bits is an FPS in which you must get from start to end. If you die anywhere along the way, you have to restart from the beginning of the level. There are 9 maps. I played the first 6 with the mentality that this was going to be one of those really hard games to pass. Sure enough it seemed hard and annoying at times, but it's all doable. I'm going to assume that the annoying parts was intentional and just clever by design. Give those players who are gluttons for punishment what they want!\n\nThen I remember taking a few months break, played level 7 then stopped for no particula reason ... pun intended. Over a year went by. After getting angry with life problems, I decided to launch Dead Bits again. Loaded up level 8. I started to remember the Dub-Step music. The awesome sound flowed into my ear canal, pumped through the veins in my head and exploded a few glial cells. It felt great!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hHZarmkZ_I\nAnother thing I noticed was that all of a sudden it felt easier than what I had remembered. In fact I found the experience quite relaxing. There were even funny WTF and what do I do now moments. The entire soundtrack is unlocked at the end ... nice reward in an old-school sense. And a bit of mystery with another character popping out in the end cinematic ... a hint for a sequel maybe?\n\nbtw: (Dead Bits)Unity Game Engine !== (Minecraft)Lightweight Java Game Library\nI don't understand how people can make that comparison.","January 15","true","4.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","0"

I'll keep this short since this game has already wasted enough of my time; but perhaps I can prevent it wasting any of yours.\n\nThe visuals are awful, the music is horrible (even if you like dubstep, it's really bad), the handling is floaty and innacurate, the mouse control is truly abysmal, the animations are basic and janky, there's a distinct lack of content and the options are almost non-existent. Controls are not rebindable and there's no option foy inverting y-axis. Actually, there's almost no options for anything. There are only nine short levels and the nicest thing I can say about the level design is 'bland'.\n\nDead Bits has no redeeming features whatsoever and should be avoided like the plague.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RobbieTFMuffin/recommended/303390/","RobbieTFMuffin","The Fluffy Muffin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RobbieTFMuffin/","89 products in account","It's a pretty okay FPS game. It's not top-notch, however. Here is my review:\n\nIt's a fun and colorful first-person shooter that seems very suiting for a child, yet fun enough for a gamer such as myself to give it a shot. It has 9 unique levels with a cubic pixel art-esque design to it, full of zombies and demons and blocks (Oh, my!), which is great. It has a nice variety of three, count 'em, THREE weapons (as far as I know). It's very simple to start playing and very hard to stop until you beat it.\nIt also has a pretty good framerate on my 2003 Windows XP Hewlett-Packard laptop. If you like FPS games but don't have a lot of money or an insane gaming build, then consider buying this. The graphics are still great.\n\nNow, the not-so-good part:\n- The game is extremely short, not even an hour's worth of gameplay\n- Level design needs serious work, as there's tons of holes in the ground\n- If you're on a moving platform, Quilly (Protagonist) won't move with it, so be very careful.\n- Enemies on early levels are poorly placed, seemingly spammed onto the map.\n- Very repetitive gameplay\n- Imperfect parkour\n- Unbalanced weapon to enemy health ratio\n\nNow the part what everyone wants to here. Is it recommended? YES and NO. But personally, I'm leaning more toward YES. The game may not be perfect, but the $1 price tag is fair enough in my opinion. And it goes on sale A LOT. The gameplay is fun nonetheless, and is challenging in certain levels (LEVEL 3, 6 AND 7). Simple controls and very great optimization so even your toaster can run the game at a solid 60 frames per second. It has parkour, kinda, which is difficult which adds to the fun of the challenge (Lv6) and the graphics are good enough for you to make out what it going on.\n\nI rate 7/10.\n\nNote to developer(s): I enjoyed your game thoroughly, however the one thing that got me the most was the weapon inbalance and/or the enemies' health. The shotgun is very overpowered and does not need perfect aim to take 350 HP off of an enemy. The melee weapon did a significant amount of damage at 200 HP, which is balanced with enemy's health. The machine gun only did 20 HP damage, which was very poor when it came to the enemies' health. It does somewhat remind me of Call of Duty Zombies, at around Round 12. The game clearly needs work, but you've done good so far. Keep it up ;)\n\n","November 2, 2015","true","0.6"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","9","17","3","1"

You have different monsters to kill in each one, in some you can drive a vehicle, in others you don't even have a weapon and you mostly have to parkour to complete it.\n+ Another thing I like is that you don't have to reload your weapons, once you pick it up, you can press the shoot button and never let go, that makes the big areas with many mosters slightly easier than it should, but I don't mind.\n+ The boss battles are very satisfying and difficult, especially the one in Test 6, that one was a doosie.\n+ NO CHECKPOINTS, you will die a lot and some levels are pretty lengthy, having no checkpoints makes the game much more difficult that it normally would be. I like that, saving anywhere you want is not to my liking, especially in a game like this. Sometimes it could be very frustrating ofcourse, but you can always replay the level.\n+ Tha graphics are nothing special, but I love the art style, punching a wall and seeing all the bits and pieces of it fly in random directions is very satisfying.\n============\nThe game has many flaws aswell:\n\n- Jumping is weird and very floaty, you don't know where you are going to land and sometimes you can't move mid-air.\n- Walking feels a bit weird too and also floaty, in some instances you can walk over a one block wide gap, in others you can't. This is very apparent in Test 6.\n- There is no A.I. whatsoever, the monsters just run at you and if they get stuck behind a wall, they will stay there and you can shoot at them until they die. Sometimes they even fall from the world if there is a gap between you and them.\n=============\nFinal words:\nI really liked the game. I got it for 14 cents with a 97% discount and already got my money back by selling trading cards, the game is worth so much more than that and I recomment it to everyone, once you get used to the jumpind mechanics, you will like it. It took me 15 minutes to see the appeal of it.","December 20, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/huskyfox/recommended/303390/","huskyfox","Husky Fox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/huskyfox/","430 products in account","TL;DR at the end!\n\nWhere many people have stated that this is one of the worst games ever, I disagree. While not necessarily being a 'good' game, it's something that I would recommend for the current sale price, 14 cents, however, would advise against purchasing if not $1 or under.\n\nThe game features 9 levels of increasing difficulty, many which explores various playing styles, including shooting, parkour (think jumping challenges) and vehicle combat. While all of these things are touched upon a very basic level, it keeps your limited experience with the game interesting.\n\nWhere other's have noted that the maneuverability of the character is difficult and poorly designed, I have not found this to be a problem for myself. However, the AI is very simplistic, but it's arguable that the simplicity of the characters match that of the overall style of the game itself.\n\nThe visual design of the game is clearly not very in-depth with 95% of the games assets being made up of cubes and solid colours. At times, the level design is questionable with many sections seeming unnecessary, such as platforms leading to nowhere. The theme of the game varies along the levels from encountering zombies with traditional weaponry (rifle/shotgun) to some sort of laser weapon where you fight UFO's (and eventually get to control one).\n\nThe overall sounds of the game are very basic, I wouldn't be surprised if they were from free-sounds, however, the dubstep-y style of music is quite interesting and often suits the tempo of play. If you're into more techno style of music, you might enjoy this.\n\nOne of the few qualms that I have the this game is that of the UI. In the game, there are no labels for each element. For instance, I wasn't aware that the numbers on the bottom of the screen was my health indicator until the third level. Pressing escape brings up a 'pause' UI, with settings and menu buttons, however, it doesn't actually pause the game; enemies will still attack you and you can still move your character. Another issue which I had with the game was the occasional frame rate drop when many elements on screen (with a GTX 760), which as times would cause me to miss a jump.\n\nTL;DR:  In all, I would recommend this game on sale, not the full price of $5 (at the time of writing). It's a nice casual game which will take you around 40 mins to complete the 9 levels it has in full. It's a perfect game to play if you're waiting for something else to download. On sale, you could make your money back from cards. Some UI and stability issues are present, but not that bad.","December 20, 2014","true","0.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You have different monsters to kill in each one, in some you can drive a vehicle, in others you don't even have a weapon and you mostly have to parkour to complete it.\n+ Another thing I like is that you don't have to reload your weapons, once you pick it up, you can press the shoot button and never let go, that makes the big areas with many mosters slightly easier than it should, but I don't mind.\n+ The boss battles are very satisfying and difficult, especially the one in Test 6, that one was a doosie.\n+ NO CHECKPOINTS, you will die a lot and some levels are pretty lengthy, having no checkpoints makes the game much more difficult that it normally would be. I like that, saving anywhere you want is not to my liking, especially in a game like this. Sometimes it could be very frustrating ofcourse, but you can always replay the level.\n+ Tha graphics are nothing special, but I love the art style, punching a wall and seeing all the bits and pieces of it fly in random directions is very satisfying.\n============\nThe game has many flaws aswell:\n\n- Jumping is weird and very floaty, you don't know where you are going to land and sometimes you can't move mid-air.\n- Walking feels a bit weird too and also floaty, in some instances you can walk over a one block wide gap, in others you can't. This is very apparent in Test 6.\n- There is no A.I. whatsoever, the monsters just run at you and if they get stuck behind a wall, they will stay there and you can shoot at them until they die. Sometimes they even fall from the world if there is a gap between you and them.\n=============\nFinal words:\nI really liked the game. I got it for 14 cents with a 97% discount and already got my money back by selling trading cards, the game is worth so much more than that and I recomment it to everyone, once you get used to the jumpind mechanics, you will like it. It took me 15 minutes to see the appeal of it.","December 20, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The combat is simplistic, repetitive, and tedious; the physics and platforming are wonky and unpredictable; the graphics are often hideous and/or epilepsy inducing; the difficulty ranges from stupidly easy to rage inducingly hard; and what little story there is seems kind of like the ravings of a mad man and feels somewhat unnecessary. But for some reason it kept me playing to the end. Sure it was incredibly frustrating, and I had already gotten all the card drops (enough to more than make up for the cost of the game, the main reason I even bought and played this), but something just compelled me to press forward and beat this game. I just wanted to show it who's boss. And I did. All in all I beat the game in about 2 and a half hours, including the wholly unnecessary post-credits cutscene in which you watch the protaganist sleeping for what feels like a full minute and a half as nothing happens (other than a brief one second glimpse of some strange duck-like creature that seems to be spying on our hero with no explanation).\n\nGet this game if you want free money, keep playing if you like dubstep made by aliens and getting ticked off when your character randomly spazzes out and throws himself off a cliff.","December 22, 2014","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are also plataform sections, even though the jumping sucks, you can't control it at all in mid air and you jump very slowly, you expect to be able to go the same speed horizontaly jumping as you go walking, but that's not the case, while jumping you just move slowly, making the plataforming very awkward. Besides, the graphics just don't do their job, in the fire level for example, you can't touch the stationary orange blocks because they are supposed to be lava, and yet later in the level there are some orange plataforms that you're required to go through to advance, nevermind the fact that right before those blocks there was a hekf wall of orange blocks that you die if you touch, there's simplistic, and then there's just lazy, the graphics in this game are just lazy, I don't mind simple looking games, but the graphics have to at least do their job of diplaying what's on screen.","June 8, 2015","false","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Difficulty and length of levels is exponential.

The game feels unfinished. And that's the biggest and only problem this game has.\n\nThe idea of the game is kinda fun. I've always liked physics based games and just stuff that can be blown up with weapons. I really loved the look of the game and watched the trailer saying to myself: "Wow! This has to be one of the coolest games released lately and it's only 4.99€!". Although I payed 0.99€ for this.\n\nUnfortunately, the 1€ was too high price for this... demo game. Everything is wrong about this game... AI sucks, levels suck, the game is too short and the game just feels like a huge scam! There are plenty of free Flash games that are better than this game. Flash games! Those games are considered softcore/only for casual gamers but here I am, a hardcore gamer saying Flash games are better than this piece of "game".\n\nThere's sop much potential about this game. This could've been a great game. Imagine. Multiplayer, co-op, level editor, Steam Workshop... It would've been great and would be awesome game to create levels in to. But at this point this game feels like an Early Access game that gets new stuff added every so often. But no. It seems like this is the final product. This is the game they are selling on Steam. This is the game that Valve accepted! This is what we are asking to pay for!\n\nDo not buy this. Avoid at all costs. If you ever get to grab this for, I dunno, less than the price of 4 Steam Trading Cards then this game is definetly worth of grabbing because of the Tradnig Cards...\n\nEvery game you thought was bad is good compared to this one... Homefront? Masterpiece. Bad Rats? Hilarious piece of crap. Ride to Hell: Retribution? A fun game to waste some time. You name any game you hate, I can and will say it is a good game compared to this...\n...thing...\n\nThis. Is.

I bought this game on sale which it is frequently on and then after a short period of playing, making coffee and toast, and petting the dog, I sold the trading cards for more than the price I paid originally. However, I will not allow this to unbias my review.\nDead Bits: a Bit of a Hidden Gem?Pros:\n+ Moments where you actually feel like one cool bad apple!\n+ Wub Wub Wub\n\nCons:\n- FOR A DUB STEP GAME WITH AWESOME SOUNDTRACK WHY IS IT ALWAYS DAMN TOO SILENT!!\n- No Jetpack\n- No Infinite loop spawn of monsters and wub wub wub horde style mode.\n\nConclusion: Come for the trading cards, stay for the wub. Regardless if you buy this game on sale or not, Dead Bits is still a fun way to kill an hour. It is a shame with a little more polish and tought. this game could have really been something much much more.

Absolutely not worth a cent.\n\nMouse acceleration. Floaty controls. Enemy animations (what are they, dancing before you walk right in front of them, as if they don't see you?). The only good thing about this is the graphic style. The physics engine is terrible, and performance drops whenever there are more than 20-30 physical elements for it to calculate.\n\nAlso, my god, the soundtrack. Dubstep? Seriously?\n\nThe menus are simplistic, though passable. The lack of a choice of resolution or individual graphics quality options is absolutely unforgivable, as is the lack of key rebinding. Also, did I mention mouse accel?\n\nAlso for some reason each stage requires that you press your Return key before it actually starts, as if the programmer couldn't just run the level from the start. This wastes 5-10 seconds each time you load a level. And since in the later levels you die a lot, that's a TON of time wasted.\n\nBottom line: don't get it. And in the off chance you get it for free, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON IT LIKE I DID.\nIt's not worth it.","April 28, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In order to escape, he must go through 9 of the alien leader's tests. The game is just a generic FPS where you shoot at random enemies until they die. Enemies are slower than you and you never have to reload, so all you need to do is run away and shoot. No effort required.\n\nDespite the combat being incredibly easy, the game still has ways of making itself difficult. For starters, the game will go into a black and white slow-mo effect at random when you shoot at enemies. This feature is as annoying as it sounds, and gets old immediately after the first time its used (and no, it can not be turned off). For a few levels, you need to kill every enemy to unlock the next level. So if you're at the end of a level but forgot just one enemy, you'll have to go all the way back.\n\nOn top of this, jumping is really awkward. Whenever you jump, you are basically locked into that animation, so if you stand still and jump, you will always go straight up even if you try to move in the air. In a regular FPS, this wouldn't be that much of a problem, but in one that relies heavily on platforming such as Dead Bits, it often leads to many accidental deaths. Also if you die, you always get kicked back to the level select screen.\n\nThe visuals do not bring the game any justice either. The game is composed entirely of blocks, making the game look like some crappy Minecraft mod. The music is just generic dubstep, supposedly to give you that cool and hip "420 blaze it" feel that the kids are into nowadays. Everything in the game from the text to how you start each level in mid-air feels like some sort of mod and lacks any polish (the button you click on the menu to go into level select is always titled "new game;" think about that for a second).\n\nYes, I am aware that this game was apparently made by one person. I can get past the graphics and the music, but the monotonous gameplay and other faults are what keeps this game from being a decent experience. If you really want to try it out, it's only $1 so knock yourself out. Otherwise, save your precious dollar for something better.","March 6","false","4.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In order to escape, he must go through 9 of the alien leader's tests. The game is just a generic FPS where you shoot at random enemies until they die. Enemies are slower than you and you never have to reload, so all you need to do is run away and shoot. No effort required.\n\nDespite the combat being incredibly easy, the game still has ways of making itself difficult. For starters, the game will go into a black and white slow-mo effect at random when you shoot at enemies. This feature is as annoying as it sounds, and gets old immediately after the first time its used (and no, it can not be turned off). For a few levels, you need to kill every enemy to unlock the next level. So if you're at the end of a level but forgot just one enemy, you'll have to go all the way back.\n\nOn top of this, jumping is really awkward. Whenever you jump, you are basically locked into that animation, so if you stand still and jump, you will always go straight up even if you try to move in the air. In a regular FPS, this wouldn't be that much of a problem, but in one that relies heavily on platforming such as Dead Bits, it often leads to many accidental deaths. Also if you die, you always get kicked back to the level select screen.\n\nThe visuals do not bring the game any justice either. The game is composed entirely of blocks, making the game look like some crappy Minecraft mod. The music is just generic dubstep, supposedly to give you that cool and hip "420 blaze it" feel that the kids are into nowadays. Everything in the game from the text to how you start each level in mid-air feels like some sort of mod and lacks any polish (the button you click on the menu to go into level select is always titled "new game;" think about that for a second).\n\nYes, I am aware that this game was apparently made by one person. I can get past the graphics and the music, but the monotonous gameplay and other faults are what keeps this game from being a decent experience. If you really want to try it out, it's only $1 so knock yourself out. Otherwise, save your precious dollar for something better.","March 6","false","4.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Mechanics are a bit awkward, something you would really need to get used to first. If you're considering buying it then wait until it's on sale. You know it's trashy. And probably not that Nicolas-Cage-way trashy you know, it's the real thing. This only has 9 levels but it would really be enough, trust me.","October 31, 2014","true","1.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Game acts like you're going to willfully play through stages again through 'level select' interface... eff that. Long load times. When you die, get taken to a 'You Died' screen with zombies eating you though I died on level design mostly. REALLY LONG PAUSES BEFORE RESTART LEVEL. Devs, please don't do that. Open up Portal, load one of the few levels where you can die in stuff, time how long from death to restart, then redo everything in your game to be like that.\n\nPlease identify the volume controls. Your WUB WUB WUB is meh meh meh.","July 3, 2014","false","1.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Die ( and you will die a lot, falling from plataforms) and restart a level from the beggining is HELL. And a lot of ohter things. Resume:  Do not buy this game!","July 4, 2014","false","1.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"
