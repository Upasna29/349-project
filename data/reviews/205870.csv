Each set of bars will be a different part (melody, bass, secondary, etc) which combine to create the piece of music for that act. This is done using a varying set of tools (directional/rejection, portals, speed up/slow down, etc) and challenges (colors, splitting streams, etc) in order to meet the requirements for each level. It should be noted that while this is a music game, it's NOT a rhythm game.\n\nWhile there's no demo, you can find the first 2 (or 3? I can't recall) Acts on the developer's website: http://www.cipherprime.com/games/auditorium which introduces the core concepts. It's how I was first exposed to it years before it came out on Steam.\n\nThis isn't a game that I'd recommend sitting down and cranking through - you'll knock out a few levels, and then move on to something else. It's not terribly difficult, but makes for an excellent, relaxing palete cleanser. Think "tablet game designed before tablet games were a thing."","February 13, 2014","true","2.5"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","26","27","0","0"

Its mechanics are elegant, and initially relaxing.\n\nThe difficulty ramps up pretty quickly, though. About half-way through the puzzle list, puzzle solving becomes less about having a moment of inspiration, and more about sliding the puzzle elements around the screen and seeing what happens. Sometimes moving a puzzle element just one or two pixels can dramatically change what's happening on screen. At this point, the game feels much less elegant, and more like a grind.\n\nStill, auditorium has a certain charm, and memorable gameplay.","July 20, 2013","true","6.1"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

As it's Cipher Prime's standard, they tried to make an unique game, which ended up successfully.\n\nGameplay revolves around using direction changers of sound wavelength that you have to direct into a speaker. You might experience a similar feel to a puzzle games built around gravity, as you'll have to set the reach radius of direction changers. But there are actually not just objects to change directions, there are also speed modifiers or attractors.\n\nWhat's really worth praising is the fact that levels doesn't have a specific solution - it's up to your experiments that leads to your own way of activating the relaxing music (beating the level). In combination with great soundtrack and gorgeous flow of differently coloured wavelengths, Auditorium is worth even to those who aren't much into puzzle games, but want just to relax for a while at a casual game.\n\nTo name the biggest flaw of the game, is the fact that it's made in really low resolution for today's standards. There isn't a HD remake expected, so you'll have to put up with small window mode or blurry fullscreen. But to those who don't mind that, Auditorium is worth recommending.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","March 1","true","1.5"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

You use audio wavelengths to fill up some containers to produce some sweet music! Each set of levels work as segments in a musical piece which you must 'fix' to complete the song. The brilliant color combinations complete the experience and really make this puzzler a winner.\n\nBe aware after the first Act things get much more difficult, I found myself worrying less about any audio elements and just working the levels like a jigsaw puzzle. These levels do take some thinking at times, but they make sense so you can usually fidget with things enough to complete the puzzle. The price is way too much for this offering though, especially since their main claim is being an "Award Winning Browser Game".

All ruined by a few problems that are supposed to make the game.\n\nThe mechanics in the game are pretty much self-taught through a bit of screwing around and new ones are introduced as you progress. The game gets deceptively tougher very early on and not too long it will start to feel a little less like a puzzle game about guiding lights and a little more about trial & error to find out what works though that could just mean I started to get bad at the later levels.\n\nFor a game about putting together a tune that's supposed to loop it sure doesn't loop properly. The short songs aren't bad but it becomes extremely clear that each song cuts out at the end and starts over again as opposed to properly transitioning from end to beginning unnoticed to make a working looping song.\nAlso often times the game will bug a bit and some of the sounds & instruments won't even start to play after I direct a light to a volume bar thing. The sounds can be restored if the game is restarted.\n\nIt's a relatively simple game that to me is unfortunately overall ruined by technical problems.","July 30, 2015","false","6.2"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

After playing the game for a while I found that I didn’t even get one of the two things I was hoping. The puzzle itself starts as an original concept but it quickly turned to a game mechanic where I completed countless stages just by cheesing my way through. And the “music”, the sole thing that actually made me get this game, is nothing but a 15 to 20 second track that loops into infinity. The loops themselves COULD have been fine but, due to some laziness or something involving some differences in taste, the loops make it so obvious where it’s looping and gave me a little cringe every time it looped.

The Store page promotes the game as "See why Auditorium has won countless awards and is considered the Second Best Browser Game of All Time."  I've never heard of the game but the grandiose description is not propaganda.\n\nAfter spending sometime with Auditorium I can see why the game has won countless awards.  I'm going to classify Auditorium as one of those where did this come from works of genius.  The concept is amazing and demonstrates real imagination on the part of the studio (Cipher Prime Studios) and it's developers.\n\nAuditorium is an abstract puzzler where you manipulate beams of light with and through constructs thus creating a musical score.  When the score is fully realized you've solved the puzzle.  If you haven't seen or heard of Auditorium I'll leave my description as is for Auditorium like another favorite puzzler of mine, Fractal: Make Blooms Not War (another Cipher Prime Studios work), is a puzzler where you discover the game's mechanics and once you start solving each puzzle and unearth the purpose of each of the game's constructs the feeling of satisfaction is immense and keeps you tuned in for the next puzzle.\n\nAuditorium is worthy.

I hesitate to call it a puzzle game because the whole way through a level in Auditorium is nothing but zen and relaxation. When I think puzzle game I think mental stress; this is the exact opposite.\n\nEach chapter is a song which is further broken down into levels of parts for that song. For example, the first level may be the bass line while the second and third levels establish the intertwining melodies. To complete a level all you have to do is direct the flowing particles to a certain destination. While there are some serious shenanigans that must be pulled to complete later levels, the atmosphere and music combined with the peacefully flowing particles creates this meditative trance that entirely drains away all of your stress.\n\nOn a side note, this game runs ABYSMALLY. On my overclocked GTX 680 I can only average 20-30 fps. Take one look at a screenshot and you will be baffled as well at such a terrible framerate. That being said, due to the minimalist design, a poor framerate doesn’t destroy the incredible feeling from playing.\n\nAuditorium is a really cool experience, there’s not a ton of content but for a quick relaxing session it really is worth every penny.","February 17, 2015","true","0.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

You use these to manipulate and bend the colour in the level to fill up a kind of "meter". For example, you bend the red light to the red meter, and if the flow of the light is constant enough (not just flicking it around), it will stay full.\nEach meter plays a sound, and get increasingly louder as it gets fuller. Each colour makes a different sound when put into its place, you fill all of them in the level and each sound will work together to create a piece of music.\nEvery level and every stage is different and you are slowly introduced to more tools and more colours to play around with.\n\nThe music in this game is great, it’s calm and not to overpowering. The only downside in my eyes would be that if you’re stuck on a level, and I mean really stuck, it can get a little repetitive and annoying.\nI won’t lie, a few points during the game I wanted to mute the game completely because hearing the same chimes over and over had really started to hurt my head. But then again, having the volume up fairly loud is no help.\n\nIt isn’t all that long of a game, but for me it was a good length, I didn't get bored before the finish and I didn't end up saying "that it?", seeing as there isn’t a storyline to keep me hooked. I think the length of the game was reasonable.\n\nAll in all, the game is great. Cipher prime really know how to make great puzzle games with wonderful visuals.

The screenshots made me think it was some kind of visual music player with gameplay elements added somewhere into the whole package. Like I said, I was wrong. It's a pretty game (windowed; it's looks extremely blurry in full screen) where you shift around dots with arrows on them to redirect a stream of grey colors. You can also increase the radius of the dots.\nThe idea is to get the stream across all colored bars at the same time, producing music. In order to do that, the stream has to move in circles, to the left, right, you name it.\nIt's beautiful in motion, but placing the dots is clumsy. I frequently moved around the wrong dot and eventually had to restart the level so I could see clearly again.\nAlso, like their other game Fractal, there's no tutorial.

You start with a set stream of notes that fly by, and you have to direct them to boxes with a number of present gadgets you can move and change size/effect in order to max out all of the boxes' gauges and clear the stage.  Each box also seems to represent an instrument, and as the notes fill the box, the instrument will get progressively louder.  Thus, you're sorta making music by completing the stages.  It's also somewhat difficult since you have to fine-tune some of the gadgets' sizes and placements to get the stream working the way you want, and it seems at times you need luck on your side to get enough of the notes to pass through boxes enough to count as complete.

In fact, unless I'm forgetting something, I've only had it once to date: When playing Auditorium just now. Yes, I've played it once, for perhaps 20 minutes, and it's already got me itching to send this recommendation out into the world.\n\nI won't say that this game is deep, per se. But for me (and perhaps for other music+game lovers?) it is highly satisfying.\n\nIf you're curious about mechanics, you basically use gravity wells to shoot particles of raw music potential, attempting to intersect them with regions of space representing instruments. Some instruments require tuned particles, so you must first direct them through color-tuning fields before slingshotting back to instrument areas. Basically, you create galaxies of swirling colorful particles, that, when lined up just so, create a glorious symphony of sounds to reward you.\n\nThe effect is marvelous and transporting. On almost every level I've played so far (perhaps the first 15 or so), I've gotten lost in the beauty of my own musical universe of swirling lights. I find myself staring into each beautiful solution, until the desire to make NEW music finally overwhelms the desire to languish.\n\nDuly recommended.","December 16, 2013","true","0.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The additional requirement is doing that with proper colours. Sound simple, but the fun is to achieve it. Sometimes you are facing crazy layouts and this is why this game is fun :D\n\nYou have two categories of tool to reach the goal: static and dynamic.\nStatic tools are in form of areas that affect the stream(s) of particles. You can't move those. There are: teleports, splitters, areas of particular colour and black holes that consume the particles.\nDynamic tools are the tools you have to use to control the particles. You can place them where you want and you can adjust the strenght of their effects. There are: change directions (swirls, redirects, reflects), boost the speed, contain the particles.\nBoth categories contain just a few tools, but the level layout is what makes it enough. When you face bars placed in unaccessble areas you suddenly realize it's not that easy to achieve the goal. The game isn't hard, but sometimes tool placement is very sensitive and you have to keep trying. It's a puzzler afterall, and it's a good one. The road to the goal is interesing and is the essence of this game.\n\nThe game has a minimalistic graphical presentation, but nothing else is needed. Streams of particles and how they go on their way to the "exit" is often spectacular. The solutions often end up being a fierce storm of colourful streams of particles. That speed of colours of various shapes just looks amazing.","December 21, 2014","true","11.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/V2Blast/recommended/205870/","V2Blast","V2Blast","http://steamcommunity.com/id/V2Blast/","495 products in account","Auditorium is a game based around some very simple mechanics that affect how various colored particles move and change color. The game consists of 15 levels of 4-5 stages each. Each stage requires the player to direct particles of specific colors toward each "container" or sensor. Each sensor is associated with one color (or more, in later levels), and the player must find a way to fill the bars of all sensors on the stage at the same time.\n\nDespite the straightforward mechanics of the game, the difficulty of the puzzles lies in the ways the different mechanics interact; it's easy enough to get one stream of particles to go towards one sensor, but when you're dealing with 2 streams, 5 sensors (several of which are multi-color), and a black hole, and you only have a few items to work with, things can get a little tricky. These complex interactions can be a little unpredictable, so later levels may involve a lot of trial and error - even if you look up a solution online, being a few pixels off can throw a wrench into the works.\n\nDespite ostensibly being a game heavily involving music, the soundtrack is not that great. All the stages consist of short repeating loops of music; each sensor, when filled, causes one element or instrument of the music for that level to play. When the stage is completed, the screen changes to indicate this as the music continues to play. Because the music consists of short loops, however, even the best music gets old quickly.\n\nThis game is probably best played in short bursts. I decided to sit down and beat most of the game today (I'd probably finished the first two levels years ago), and just finished it. Overall, Auditorium is more of a webtoy than a proper game, but it's still quite enjoyable and challenging for what it is. There's probably not much replay value once you beat it; though theoretically you could mess around and find alternate solutions for each stage, there's no real motivation to do so. I would probably not have paid full-price for the game, but I would recommend checking it out if it's on sale. Plus, you can always check out the demo online first if you're unsure about buying.","January 23, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To accomplish that you must use a variety of modifying symbols and take into account the field structure of the level. As you light up more and more audio channels, the game rewards you by playing more portions of the music. The game starts you off nice and easy but ramps up to where completing a stage needs a little thinking.

The game consists of 15 levels of 4-5 stages each. Each stage requires the player to direct particles of specific colors toward each "container" or sensor. Each sensor is associated with one color (or more, in later levels), and the player must find a way to fill the bars of all sensors on the stage at the same time.\n\nDespite the straightforward mechanics of the game, the difficulty of the puzzles lies in the ways the different mechanics interact; it's easy enough to get one stream of particles to go towards one sensor, but when you're dealing with 2 streams, 5 sensors (several of which are multi-color), and a black hole, and you only have a few items to work with, things can get a little tricky.

All the stages consist of short repeating loops of music; each sensor, when filled, causes one element or instrument of the music for that level to play. When the stage is completed, the screen changes to indicate this as the music continues to play.

However, keep in mind that it says 'played 0.5 hours' for a reason. This is NOT a solid review, and at best a first impression (though I've attempted it four or five times now).\n\nTo its credit, the game is elegant and simple. There's this stream that goes in one direction and you have to place 'circles' to break that flow. Some send the flow in a certain direction, others make it loop, and...I haven't gotten around to even explore them all. In any case, these circles come with an adjustable intensity that increase or decrease its effect.\nAnd the point of the game? Set the circle so the stream goes through all the ...erm...volume squares (whatever they're called. just look at the pics or video, okay?). That the music only starts playing when the stream passes these squares is pretty original...\n\n...unfortunately, this is the sort of game I just don't get. I get that it's supposed to be meditating or calming, or something, but on my end, it achieves exactly the opposite. I blame controls mostly (or rather: my inability to grasp them...feel free to blame me). Those streams don't "break" easily, resulting in many attempts at just getting me nowhere except in a "COME ON...go THERE, you...!!!" kind of growling voice. The proper placement is far from where I intuitively want to place them, which makes combinations a matter of blind luck. Again: to me. I can understand that if you understand the game, it'll be much more fun. But there is also some delay if you change things. And that makes juggling the stream even harder. More than once, I thought I had it...then it turned out that the act of me moving the circle temporarily had it touch all the needed squares, yet in the final form didn't hit one or even either one.\n\nIt's not for me. I usually tend to like minimalistic, abstract and (especially) original games, but that doesn't mean it gets a free pass. I'm not sure why it's tagged as "music" either. Yes, it has music, but it's in no way part of the gameplay (yes, it plays a larger role than the average game, but not by much.

In fact, I found nothing wrong with the gameplay, and it's possible that my main criticisms are addressed in an update as they are technically aesthetic. But since there's plenty of good reviews, I thought I'd share some criticism I hadn't seen.\n\nGood stuff: You can make your own solutions for any given level (it's decently lenient), a new gameplay element is introduced each Act, and it's decently challenging and brain-teasing. I like how it just shows the visually-pleasing moving particles when you finish a level, and the gimmick of fading in the song's sound channels as you light up the levels' targets (this is the only thing that relates it to the title, by the way) is somewhat pleasing. But...\n\nDon't think you're generating music with it. I knew going in that it wasn't a rhythm game, but even so, remember that all you're doing is fading in some pre-made audio tracks. Not necessarily a bad thing, but just so you know. If you thought that was one of its selling points, it isn't.\nIt's kinda repetitive in that it lacks visual and audio variety. While each Act has a different song, each level does not, and even though some levels add new channels of the same song, it still feels like you're dealing with the same loop for too long and it gets slightly grating. And the solid black background never changes. The particle colors are pretty and gameplay-relevant (this is probably colorblind-unfriendly), so I understand the lack of wilder variations, but at least something like a cityscape sillouette, a jungle one, a dark ocean floor, I dunno, put some effort into it.\nThe tracks don't loop properly. Wait, what?\nLet's elaborate on why the looping thing sucks for a game of this type, shall we? While not advertised as a rhythm game, it is undeniably music-driven. It's right there in the title. And they're not even like, amazing music samples, it just kinda has a "Garageband default instruments" feel to it. So... I dunno, if you couldn't have some sort of dynamic music sequencing, at least look up "How to make the music in your game loop well" on friggin' Google or something?

In it, the player must direct beams of light to pass over audio boxes and to hear music. I'd say that most of the puzzles are fairly easy (there are a couple that are difficult though.) But I believe that the game is visually and audibly stunning.\n\nThe gameplay is simple. Light streams out from fixed locations. The player manipulates several different types of lenses to direct the rays of light to audio boxes. The lenses can be resized and can be moved around the screen. Obstacles may appear, and may be useful or a hindrance depending on the circumstances.\n\nAudio boxes play music when hit with the correct colored light. Each box will play one instrument of a piece of music. Different music pieces are separated into "acts." The music is filled out more as the player progresses through each act. The final level of each act automatically plays the completed music. All levels (including the special level) can be played once unlocked.\n\nI was impressed by the designers make creative use of the game's mechanics. I found myself using lenses in unexpected ways. So, a something like a "light gravity well" can scatter light just as easily as it can clump it together, and an arrow lens can bend light just as easily as it can bounce light.\n\nI find the game itself is artistically stunning. It fills me with a sense of wonder when I play it. Each packet of light leaves a feint afterglow in it's wake. Multiple packets of light cause entire areas of the screen to glow. It felt like I was drawing with light as I was moving the lenses around. There were times when I'd rather play around than complete the level. The game encourages this by removing all lenses and obstacles, and showing only the light once each level is completed.\n\nThe level design often coveys a feeling related to the music. For example, I found one level of the act of daydream requires almost no effort to complete (I consider it like daydreaming in that regard,) and the way the light moves in Atlantic looks like streams of water moving around.\n\nThe music is also good, although each piece is fairly short. By far, my favorite piece is Luminal, followed by Daydream. But, I enjoyed all the pieces of music. The whole thing, from opening scene to end credits, feels professionally done.\n\nThe game has flaws. One problem is that the music is short. Most musical pieces last between 10 to 20 seconds. On particularly difficult puzzles, you could hear the same music dozens, possibly hundreds of times before moving on. This can grow tedious after a while.\n\nThe game also has minor issues with the controls, At first, I had a bit of trouble figuring out that you could resize the lenses. (A little experimentation and it became intuitive though.) Sometimes when I resize lenses placed next to each other, I accidentally resize the wrong thing. (This often has the effect of scattering light everywhere, which can be fun.) Although, The problem is understandable because you have multiple layers of objects on top of each other, and the game does a good job of handling it.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed Auditorium and I think it is very well done. If you love puzzles, love that sense of wonder that comes from an hearing amazing performance, love exploring new ideas, and/or love color, light, and music, then you'll probably enjoy this game.\n\nIf you just want to hear music, then consider that most of the music is between 10 to 20 seconds long. If you're looking for a challenging puzzle, then know that the game is fairly short and most of the puzzles are easy. Even so, I really enjoyed it.","May 23, 2015","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In any case, these circles come with an adjustable intensity that increase or decrease its effect.\nAnd the point of the game? Set the circle so the stream goes through all the ...erm...volume squares (whatever they're called. just look at the pics or video, okay?). That the music only starts playing when the stream passes these squares is pretty original...\n\n...unfortunately, this is the sort of game I just don't get. I get that it's supposed to be meditating or calming, or something, but on my end, it achieves exactly the opposite. I blame controls mostly (or rather: my inability to grasp them...feel free to blame me). Those streams don't "break" easily, resulting in many attempts at just getting me nowhere except in a "COME ON...go THERE, you...!!!" kind of growling voice. The proper placement is far from where I intuitively want to place them, which makes combinations a matter of blind luck. Again: to me. I can understand that if you understand the game, it'll be much more fun. But there is also some delay if you change things. And that makes juggling the stream even harder. More than once, I thought I had it...then it turned out that the act of me moving the circle temporarily had it touch all the needed squares, yet in the final form didn't hit one or even either one.\n\nIt's not for me. I usually tend to like minimalistic, abstract and (especially) original games, but that doesn't mean it gets a free pass. I'm not sure why it's tagged as "music" either. Yes, it has music, but it's in no way part of the gameplay (yes, it plays a larger role than the average game, but not by much. Or at all, if you take a strict definition of a music game).","June 2, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mostly.\n\nIt's fairly short, and I did enjoy playing through it. It's quite beautiful at times, and the puzzles are varied enough that they don't feel repetitive. It's not perfect though - as others have said, it's a bit pixellated, audio tracks sometimes stop, and there are noticeable gaps in the looping, particularly in the early levels. It's also very fiddly at times, which is perhaps inevitable for a game about directing a stream of particles around using area-of-effect forces: it's hard to be precise, and sometimes a level needs you to be. After playing through the first half in a single sitting, the last few stages I played in short sessions as otherwise it would be too frustrating.\n\nI picked it up in a sale, and don't regret that. It can be very relaxing, and there are no other games like it.","January 5","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The original game was released in 2009 as a web app, and the Steam version does show its age in that regard. The graphics are underpowered by modern standards, and the audio doesn't loop cleanly.\n\nBut, to this day, Auditorium remains one of the most creative and enjoyable games I've ever played. The mechanics are intuive but incredibly challenging as you continue playing. In the last 7 years, I've played through this game multiple times over, and my solutions to each puzzle are always different than the last time. Even though it's aged poorly, it's still fun to come back to every once in a while.\n\nUnfortunately, Auditorium doesn't get a happy ending. Its sequel, funded via Kickstarter in 2012, is one of the most notorious bits of vaporware to ever come out of the Kickstarter platform. It's a shame, too, because a sequel to this game would have been wonderful. Instead, it and Cipher Prime are posterchildren for unfulfilled Kickstarter campaigns.\n\nIf you have an unplayed copy of this game, you should definitely play it. If you don't... well, after 4 years of nothing but broken promises, it's hard to recommend giving Cipher Prime your money.","May 30","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
