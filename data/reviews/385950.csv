"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198130562680/recommended/385950/","76561198130562680","Pecan","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198130562680/","54 products in account","This review is based on only the tutorial and first scenario, just so all of you who are waiting can see some comments :-)\n\nFirst - no issues to complain about at all, so far.  There are some 'hints/tips' shown during load/save screens which can flash past a little quickly but as they're only there to give you something to look at I don't THINK I've missed anything important.\n\nGameplay :- Turn based.  a) select a protein for each of your incubators.  This is a random-draw which dictate what you'll be able to do later in the turn.  b) open the AV (doh, can't remember what it stands for!) to see which proteins you need to destroy the remaining viral hexes, c) check the store to see if there's any machine/person you wish to buy.  d) decide which of your staff and machines you wish to use this turn, e) harvest proteins and allocate them the AV f) kill those parts of the virus that your completed AV options allow, g) end turn for random events; virus spread and mutation included.  Gameplay for the first scenario is short (5 minutes) but affected by (random) mutation.  In my first playthrough I needed an additional two turns thanks to a mutation that I didn't in the second.  This second playthrough was to check replayability.  I'll leave it to you to find out what does and doesn't change, but think there's enough that you can play each scenario several times.\n\nGraphics are as good as they need to be, but this isn't a graphics-based game.  Music wasn't annoying enough to turn off - although that's generally the first thing I do in any game - and effects-sounds are also acceptable if unremarkable (again, it just isn't that sort of game, so they don't affect gameplay).\n\nSummary - plays as a puzzle game rather than 'hard science' because of the protein random-draw and various references to die-rolls (which are automatic).  Bear in mind that I have not yet played the later scenarios, where world-events become significant.  Knowing the makeup of the virus but having a random selection of proteins seems the wrong way around to me.  I'd have thought the choice of which proteins to incubate would be up to me, while trying to find a combination that was effective against a particular virus would be the hard part.\n\n[Compared to Plague Inc, since that's what a lot of people seem to be asking - You are CURING the virus here and it's entirely based in your lab.  As far as I have played (which isn't very far) there isn't the same sense of progress or control here.]","May 26","true","1.9"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","14","16","4","0"

But why is this digital version so sloooooow? Why bog down such a modest little puzzle game with so many screen and bleeps and blorps and globe displays and die rolls shoved into the corner of an otherwise useless screen?  Why not option to just GET ON WITH IT ALREADY? A sad case of how sometimes presentation can be too much.","May 27","false","0.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It's a great solitaire board-game that translates well to the PC.  There's a few things I wish it would do (e.g., keep the virus and store tabs open by default), but overall it plays really well.  No crashes either.","May 26","true","0.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It tries to be an eye-candy but fails. Unskippable visuals are really boring and make you to wait destroying any drive to move on. Protein Harvest minigame is unnecessary and boring - outcomes are random (maybe even hardcoded) and your choice means nothing. Side panels are hidden at the start of every turn though there is absolutely no point to hide them. It's just pure unnecessary visual.\n*fixed* Every couple of turns the game locks at Planetary Overview screen at the end of turn. I'm tired of restarting a game to progress.\nCheap game for tablets. Don't waste your money.","May 27","false","0.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

It crashed in the middle of the second campaign.\n\nThe UI is a bit muddled and there's very little strategy involved since most of what you can do is decided by RNG. Probably not worth a buy over $5.","May 26","false","0.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"
