(heavies can bring 4 weapons total instead of 3, btw).\n\nTL;DR, this is the best chance to possibly get back into tribes, and give it another go... and before you think of it being P2W... the weapon upgrades are gone. when you unlock a new thing, what you see is what you get.\n\nPS: any exp and gold spent has been refunded, and if you have gold, you will have access to the entire armory.","December 11, 2015","true","12.5"," 228 of 246 people (93%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","93","228","246","18","20"

Some would say it was doomed from the start with the unrewarding unlock system, and its very liberal use of micro-transactions, but what really killed the game was the "we didn't break through to a big enough market in the first year, so let's make something else" attitude from the studio.\n\nTribes Ascend was pushed aside, all future support and updates were suspended, with only the barest of support of some multiplayer-servers remaining to squeeze out any additional funds; And instead Hi-Rez focused all of their resources on the continued development and support of Smite - a MOBA game.\n\nPersonally, Tribes Ascend was the best shooter experience I'd ever had; It was fun, it was exciting, and it was difficult - But pulling off a flag grab and then securing a capture was among the most rewarding things I'd ever done in a competitive video game. I played quite a few hours of Tribes Ascend, starting in late 2011 to somewhere in the middle of 2013 (though most of it done outside of Steam because of client issues), and I shelled out quite a few bucks too - not because I had to, but because I wanted the developers to know this was a game worth the money.\n\nBut that didn't matter, and in the end Tribes Ascend simply went too fast for the devs.\n\n[VGTW]\n\nUpdate: Hi-Rez has revived Tribes Ascend, and are planning on making big, big changes to the game, most of them set to change the way the game is played. Whether this turns out to be a success, or another failed project on Hi-Rez part remains to be seen. But knowing that the community on r/tribes has been given a very large voice in all of this, I remain skeptical.","January 5, 2015","false","122.3"," 495 of 588 people (84%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","84","495","588","46","20"

The unique mechanics in this game are so original and flawless that it makes me weep for everyone who think each new call of duty is revolutionizing the FPS genre, or nearly any shooter for that matter. With tribes you need true skill to do almost anything in this beautiful game unlike some other shooters I know where spray and pray is just the norm. While that could mean a bit of a steep learning curve I guarantee you that your time will not be wasted learning this game, and you will surely understand from this from the brilliant "cha-ching" of your very first blueplate. This game is also very pretty if you can run it on the higher settings (unlike me) and the sense of speed as you fly through the terrain is unreal. Sadly though as I wright this review the developer, Hi-Rez, have completely dropped this game from their radar. It is no longer being looked after and the community is very small which is a shame with how magnificent this game is. Even though there is no campaign, no developer oversight, and hardly any people playing it this still remains to this day my #1 favorite game simply because of how perfect the core gameplay experience is and how unique this game is among the vast array of shooter that, to be honest, all feel exactly the same. Hopefully in the future there will be another addition to the tribes series and I sincerely hope that Hi-Rez will do it great justice and now that the company is out of its infancy will understand how to keep a game thriving. This game deserves so much more credit then it recieves, even if it recieved some form of GOTY award, it deserves even more attention. It saddens me that good games like this get shoved to the side and forgotten while every "new" COD gets so much attention even when it is doing the same thing over and over.\nWhat makes me most sad though is to anyone who would pick up this game today would not understand the impact this game had to some people in its prime, all they would see is hundreds of empty servers with what seems like 50 people online at any one time. Even though this game has admittedly gone downhill it will still remain as my favorite game of all time.","May 24, 2014","true","132.8"," 192 of 230 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","192","230","0","11"

Shazbot!\n\nEDIT 3 : ( Rephrased some words below, because for some reason people actually read it. )\n\n\nEDIT 1 ( MAIN PART OF THE REVIEW BELOW ):\n\nSince people actually somehow managed to find this review, I decided to put at least a little bit of an actual review in here. Not a detailed one because I haven't played the game for a long time, but my personal information about the game.\n\n(SIDENOTE: If you want a review that follows a linear flow of explaining information, this isn't the one. I mainly jump around from topic to topic, mostly because this came from the top of my head.)\n\n( Sorry random OCD guy.)\n\n\nTribes:Ascend is a great game, but sadly, a lot of players are missing from the game because developers have moved onto SMITE and they abandoned this game a while ago.\n\nThey have made some changes to the game though, that has varied since the release of Tribes:Ascend. One thing they did was cut back on the amount of grinding required, which was really nice for F2P players. The game certainly isn't pay-to-win, but it is deterring to see that a playstyle you want isn't available for you. Most of the default stuff are mostly usable, but I do have to point out that the other weapons are just more fun to use. ( And sometimes more effective. )\n\nThe gameplay features high-speed combat, which will be very rewarding to those who value skill.\nCoordinated roles and classes give the game a nice feel for it's objective based gameplay, and offers multiple different playstyles. Supportive roles, defensive roles, and offensive roles are ALL viable, and they all help you win the game. There's also a in-game voice communication system that slightly helps with immersion ( if you're into that sort of thing. )\n\nThere's also a few game modes ( many of which are probably dead. ).\n\nMy personal favorite is Capture the Flag, because it requires a variety of roles by the team.\nMaybe you want to be the guy who grabs the flag at high speed.\nMaybe you want to be the guy who sits on the flag and laughs at the guy who just died because he rammed into you at high speed.\nOr maybe, you want to be like a sneaky ninja and blow stuff up. ( People included. )\n\nThe amount of skill required in this game is more than any normal FPS. You can't just aim down the sights of your gun and kill a guy in 1 second. You need to actually try to kill him, because 95% of the weapon in this game are not hitscan, which means you WILL have to shoot ahead of a moving target and if you want your projectile to even land CLOSE to him.\n\nExperienced players will 'blue plate' someone. ( Blue plate is when you hit a poor guy directly with a spinfusor. )\n\nNewer players may find it easier to use rapid-firing weapons until they're ready to try out the Spinfusor.\n\nNew players will also learn the term 'Shazbot!' ( Which will not be explained here. )\n\nThere is progression in this game, but they unlock different playstyles and weapons, rather than directly upgrading your weapons. ( Not counting some of the other things you can upgrade, but let's forget about those for now. )\n\nYou don't unlock a grip for your gun to reduce 15% penalty to accuracy, you don't get a scope and whatever, you'll actually want to unlock other classes and weapons. One of the classes has access to a fractal grenade ( the disco grenade ) and another class has invisibility. I'm not going to list every single class, but you get the point.\n\nWeapons play a large part of Tribes as well as the classes. While a technician can put down a turret, some guy on a hill can make it rain explosives on him and clear the objective for a friendly to move in.\n\nSadly, you won't be able to unlock TotalBiscuit's voice unless you pay real money.\n\n\nYes. His voice is in the game.\n\nYou can also buy skins and stuff so you look different. Not like you'd show it off to anyone anyways.\n\n\nYou can also get credits or whatever to buy resupply points and call in orbital strikes.\nCredits are only for the duration of the match, so feel free to call in the thunder.\n\nAs for performance, I've always had a problem on low-end PCs, so this isn't really the game you want to be playing on a low budget, but you shouldn't really have any performance problems if you have a medium to high end rig. There's a few performance.ini's on the internet somewhere if you really wanna play this on a potato. Trust me, I tried, and I at least went fast enough to kill something.\n\n\nIf you've read the original portion of the review, I joke about how no one plays this ( because no one does ) but that doesn't mean I don't want anyone to play it.\n\n\nIf you have slogged through this thing that steam calls a review, give Tribes a try. If you like it, tell your friends. Maybe it'll actually have some people playing it.

Whilst yes this is true, fear not! The gaming community has more than enough leverage to bring them back to this game and these are the reasons why. Don't worry there's a TL;DR at the bottom\n\nTribes Ascend is as unique as it gets when it comes to FPS. In Tribes the maps are so huge and its ski feature allows you to go so fast and at times you can sometimes feel adrenaline pumping through your veins. Add in the weapons which are mostly splash related and the only way to survive is to be moving. Stand still and you will die- not only does this make it the fastest pace shooter, it also means there will be no campers (except snipers, duh). The tactics, strategies and innovative ideas that spring up as to how to defeat the other side gives the game a lot of depth and lot of shazbots. To list all the features, I'd be writing a PhD, so to make my life easier, there's this: http://www.hirezstudios.com/tribesascend/home\nJust because the game appears dead doesn't mean it's not good already. Sure things will seem a little empty but if enough people read this and enough people get into it, I guarantee we can change things.\n\nAll the classes blend together to create a synergy close to perfection and they individually cover so vast an angle that every class is needed and you will always see every class at work in a game. You won't see an entire team of Juggernauts because they'd be easily beaten by a nimble Pathfinder. Every class has it's pros and it's cons, and when put in a team form one mechanised unit that will steamroll the enemy. But you can also be flexible in that you won't have to stick to one class the entire time, you can switch it up. Sneaking in isn't working? Why not go in spinfusor toting and blow everything up? You don't have to invest too much into any one class and personally I find some of the starting weapons are amazing once you warm up to them. Spend hours trying them out. And if you like it, tell your friends to sign up, get the world united to bring this back, eh?\n\nAnd of course, there's the one quintessential aspect of the game I haven't explored a lot. The fact that it's free! This is a lifesaver for anyone-stingy or not and oh boy am I glad it's free. For such an amazing game, so unique and so complex I was dumbfounded at first when I found out it was free. There are those who say it's pay to win but don't take any of that nonsense. NONE of the weapons are "better" than the starting ones, they're all different and suit different people or different scenarios. For the one class you may prefer blowing people to kingdom come with the satisfaction of seeing the killing blow, having your enemies blasted out of existence with you a mile away or gunning them down while chasing them and see them try to escape. With the multitude of weapons and items available, Tribes offers you the chance to try them ALL out in the practice mode so you can set your sight on a new weapon and grind and shoot your way to the top with a goal in mind. And when you've gotten every weapon you possibly want, or every item there is available, you don't stop or run out of steam *badumtsi* because you're always trying to be the best and the adrenaline rush, the satisfaction of a Blue Plate, a headshot, a melee or anything is reward enough.\n\nTL;DR Not a moment in the game will you be bored and hours will fly by so quickly. So if you've played this before, but have felt defeated by Hi-Rez, get back on your feet or if you're completely new, go headfirst in and have a little faith. Login and start. Get your friends to jump in too. The more people we get, the more of the gaming community there are, the great ther chance of getting Hi-Rez's attention and bring this thing back. So spread the word, bring people into it, tell the gaming community and the world- even tell that random stranger on the road to. This game didn't deserve to end so quickly, so let's give it another shot.\n","January 4, 2015","true","103.4"," 138 of 172 people (80%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","80","138","172","19","6"

What's more its free to play so you've got no excuse not to give it a try.\n\nSkiing\nFor those who don't know the series Tribes offers team based gameplay with one of the best movement mechanics in arena style FPS called skiing.\nIt combines physics, jetpacks, the environment and the skill of the player to have you rocketing around the map at the speed of sound and makes for some excellent chases in capture the flag type scenarios and great combat that has you estimating trajectories of projectiles and players to produce some of the most epic trickshots you'll see in any game.\n\nClasses\nIt also has a really nice class system that has subtle class differences which are exaggerated by player role choices in game. The subtlety results in a much more natural role selection basic much more on strategy rather than the "I'm playing the heavy-defender class therefore I only defend"\n\nMap Design\nOne thing that also stands out to me is that I think the map design is beautiful for an arena game. While they do share some common features on the whole each map feels unique and have loads of great little details to bring them to life.\n\nFTP\nFinally for those who are nervous about free to plays being pay to win (as I was until recently) Tribes: Ascend feels like its got the right balance of paying giving you enough perks to make it worth it (which is important if you want the game to stay alive) but without being an essential element to play and kick ♥♥♥♥. Rather than money opening up bigger scarier guns, it seems to open up alternative roles to play within the game, all of which are available over time when playing the game for free.\n\nDownsides\nThe only thing missing from this wonderful iteration of the classic franchise is the modding that came with Tribes and Tribes 2. I remember my brother and I having a whale of a time as kids playing with a lot of mods and user generated maps that added a whole ton of content to the game. While it's obvious why this can't work in a FTP game, it's a bit of a shame. Hopefully though, if HiRez studios are successful they'll be enough interest to keep them adding official content to the game to keep us all keen.\n\nHow to try it?\nGive it a go! It's free.

UPDATE !!!\nIt's a bit of a shame but the game has been pretty much abandoned by the dev's and from what I've read the community is basically dead.

Ascend used to be OK but had input lag even on a 4GHz machine.  Unfortunately, the new patch nerfs defense so bad it turns Ascend into a bum rush & spawn camping game like 99% of the other online games.  The armor configuration method is also incredibly bad, resembling a Towers of Hanoi puzzle to select the items you want in the slots you want with many classic combinations blocked entirely.

I haven't had time to go back and try it again, but when I do, I will change this review.\n\nThis game gives shame to the name Tribes if you have ever played the original version. Tribes: Ascend focuses on quick play snatch and capture mechanics with very limited ability to defend the flag other than chasing down the enemy constantly, which is very difficult due to the 10 second captures skilled players can do.\n\nIn the original "Starsiege: Tribes", any player could set all the defenses with each team having a resource cap on the amount of defences that could be set. In Ascend, each class has their own defence abiliy and only 1 per player. So ASSUMING your team even sets down their defense ability, you have a very very small defense to block the enemy.\n\nAnother problem I have is Starseige used to actually make getting the flag difficult by putting them IN buildings with many turns and hallways so a player could not simply fly past it and grab it like in Ascend.\n\nThis game falls so short of actually being competitive it's just sad.","October 29, 2014","false","1.1"," 90 of 159 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","90","159","5","0"

Of all the F2P games out there, the system in place here feels the most abrasive. So we essentially have a fast paced and highly competitive shooter (at least, on paper) with a unique concept, but we need to "unlock" classes and weapons? I haven't played any of the other Tribes games, but even so I felt like I was playing a game that is a mere shell of its potential - and seeing how the developer outright abandoned it for a soulless MOBA cashgrab, I don't see it ever changing. The worst part about this game is that there are some genuinely fun and well designed parts when you get past the layers of cash shops and leveling systems, much like a puppy trapped in a sewer. It's heartbreaking, and its why I can't even recommend giving it a small trial.","September 23, 2014","false","7.2"," 30 of 50 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","30","50","3","0"

Did you like Tribes: V- hahahahahah, no one likes Tribes: Vengeance. But you might like Tribes: Ascend. The fundamental mechanics(especially after the latest pair of patches) are very much Ye Olde Tribes. You pick an armor weight, you pick a weapons-and-gear loadout, you spawn, you use your jetpack, you ski, you eat a spinfusor to the face like thirty times before you remember that Tribes isn't like other FPS games.\n\nBut then you get your first Air Mail or Blue Plate Special(mid-air kill), and suddenly you're having fun. Because suddenly you GET it. You get into five-minute duels with others, you grab the flag at 300kph(or stop a capper going at 300kph) and you GRIN, and suddenly it's 2am and you have to make an executive decision whether to go to work with five hours of sleep or play Tribes for another three hours and calling in sick.\n\nThe only thing holding back Tribes: Ascend is really a few balance issues(Beowulf tanks are currently a bit pitiful and Shrikes could use a mild nerf) and some map design issues(on some maps, generators and base assets are very vestigial indeed), but you should still play the game, because on the good maps, you're really going to be having a LOT of fun once you get the hang of it.\n\nPlus, you know, the damn thing's FREE.

I mean god damn, does it put games like Titianfall and the latest cawadoody entry to shame. The entire game is played with an exo-suit that makes you feel like you've got an ACME rocket-powered skatboard welded to your feet at all times. With the hilly structure of nearly all of the maps, it's like the worlds most dangerous skate park - but with guns and Capture the Flag.\n\n-The weapons. Don't expect too many traditional pew pews in Tribes. This game is fought primarily with high-velocity explosive frisbees. Spinfusors are the name of the game, and learning to use one is easy, but eyeballing the trajectory, distance, and speed of your enemy as they go screaming across the map and scoring a hit is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to master. Weapon variety is enough to keep you happy, and each one has it's own little purpose.\n\n-The classes. Old Tribes players will disticntly remember nine in total, but with recent updates it's been shaved down to three; light, medium, and heavy. Don't worry, this is probably my favorite new feature, as it allows more creativity in creating them. Classes are simple, light means go fast, heavy means big armor, and medium is a balance between the two. With the new additions, you can really carve out your niche in the match. Want to have some heavy offensive ordinance AND be able to deploy a turret now? You can. Want to carry a crossbow and a Jackal at the same time? No more class restriction on that. Chaingun AND Heavy spinfusor AND Fractal Grenade? Yep, that too. The sky's the limit.\n\n-The graphics. Not on par with a triple-A 2016 release but still really pretty if you crank everything up to max, and can still be set low enough to play on a toaster. The gameplay is the focus here.\n\n-It's free. What more could you want?\n\nSO-SO\n-Cannot be played through Steam, so your favorite dank meme name is a no-go.\n-Serves can get a bit underpopulated, but that's not bad in my opinion becaue you see a few famailiar faces from time to time.\n\n\nCON:\n-Learning curve is a bit frusturating. 20 hours in and I'm still getting my behind kicked.\n-May be dead as a doornail in a year or two.\n-I can't think of anythig else.","March 7","true","27.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

In the sense that everyone can go fast, even heavies.\n\nNow everyone has the broken perk 'Survivalist' so you can play Quake style TDM 'camp the healthkits' in every game mode and there's a large chunk of players who firmly believe that the game being slowed down like this is just the single most eSports thing to happen to T:A.\n\nAlso with 'Survivalist' integration you have infinite ammo management added to your list of things to do as a player which is supposedly not "Crutch", because being able to endlessly fire weapons adds a lot to online FPS games. It's not like managing resources, like ammo, and health, and energy, and shields, really adds any depth to a game.\n\nCan't spell "Fun" without 'irony'.","January 8","false","103.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I get what you tried to do Hi-Rez but you honesly lost me as a player with the patch. The bullet timings are improved in the patch and theres a lot more balanced weapons now. Rather than patch the game after 2 years and completely mess it up, shouldn't you have just made a new game?  It's about that time after all.\n\nIf you liked tribes before you will still enjoy this fast paced shooter but to those that grew fond of the elements first presented in tribes ascend, this game will now just irritate you as nothing is even close to what it used to be. GG Hi-Rez, you lost me as a regular player with over 800 hours.\n\nThe patch might just take some getting used to and I'm just salty cause it's not what I've wasted a lot of time and a few dollars on, but so far I am not impressed by what I see other than bullet speed improvements. Players get too many guns to the point where the classes are rendered useless and you can have a heavy armor with snipers and never know. It adds a whole new element to the game which is nice, but overall its just $hit in my opinion as of right now.\n\nI would still recommend it as there is still no other game out there like this, and being free to play it'd be dumb not to atleast try it.","December 11, 2015","true","821.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

You need quick reaction, intuition and a steady aim while you your self is on the move.\nThis game is easy to play, but freakishly hard to master. Early on you will be steamrolled all over the place by the skilled players (even on lowranked server due to high-ranked players re-rolling to play on low ranked servers). It will be frustrating, but with a bit of practice you will learn how to move to prevent being trashed all the time. Movement is really, really, really, important.\nBtw, Did I mention how important movement is to survive in the game?\nStanding still will turn you into mincemeat in no time (camping = death).\nIn the normal random game you can do whatever you like, more or less, but if you join a “PickUpGroup” (play a pug) game, you will be put in the setting of competitive gaming.

The game is really fast paced for those of you that have not played it reccomend that if you are the type of gamer that can lose there temper very easily on an online game and you like to blame it on lag then this would not be the game for you simply cause most of the players Have mastered the tragectory system meaning that they could probably predict where you are going to land or where you are going to run or ski off to and shoot a grenade at your feet from across the map. Now when i stopped playing this game my old computer fryed itself and i nearly got completly got engrossed in consol games and had completly forgot about tribes until a few days ago but could not remember the name at all until a friend that played it before said it was on steam. Now while i was downloading this i thought my preowned Toshiba laptop that i got for less than £200 wont be likley to handle this at all well tribes proved me wrong it has never lagged on me at all so far and i find that outstanding considering that TF2 lags all the time until ive been on the server for a few minutes. I feel that its unfortunate that the communilty of tribes ascend has remained so small cause if it got pretty big we would be looking at one of the biggest free to play fps games competing alongside tf2 which wasnt even originally free and many more. Ive noticed that they have only updated  a couple of times since they brought the game out to the online comunity and ive also seen people question or speculate on it but i say where did they need to improve. Now i noticed that they reduced the blast radius and damage of explosives and I would suggest a tribe customization and that would represent the players clan. But please HiRez Studios if any of you read this review please only take the suggestion if there is a boost on players in the steam and web community. I cant really think of anything bad about this game other than the auto balance system for teams i often find myself killing allot in one game then getting killed all the time in the next match I feel that this might be the only thing that could be driving people away from this game.","April 29","true","17.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","7","11","2","0"

For very well done graphics and visuals. Unfortunantly this is not what makes a good person shooter. In fact the visual crap and doo-dads actually got on my way in combat. We know everyone ignores visual effects after about 10 minutes into the game anyways.\nLevel design. Most of the levels are too close together. I suppose they HAD to do this since a larger map on high graphics would bring most pre-2010 video cards to their knees.\nBalance and gameplay. The weapons are ALL over the place and the discfuser and showcklance are on the back burner in leu of the plethera of submachineguns and assualt rifles. This is not Call of Duty, this is Tribes where aiming is HARD and predicting where you target is - is paramount. Did not seem a Tribes game to me at all. What happens when you make certain weapons really easy to use and really easy to get kills with is that the hard core, GOOD players leave the game entirely and the inexerienced kiddies and man-children move in. Then they brag about how they so owned you with a SMG from 130 meters. Yeah, it's like that.\nBeta Tester support. Let's face it, Hi-Res spent most of their time on Smite and left Tribes:Ascend out in the cold. When Beta Testers spent up to $50-$60 on buying suits and weapons (something that should have been FREE), one year later Hi-Res crapped on them when they said "Everything unlocked! Sale for $20!". Yeah, I felt cheated after spending $50 in Beta unlocking HALF THE STUFF.\nFinal note:\nI LOVE the Tribes game series. Starsiege, Tribes 2 and maybe even Tribes Veangeance (if only for the really single player campaign) are close to my gaming heart. What Hi-Res did this franchise put the nail in the coffin of this game concept that had so much promise.\nHi-Res did to Tribes what George Lucas did to Star Wars.","March 15, 2014","false","193.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

But as many other reviewers have pointed out, Hi-Rez Studios has stopped updating and patching it. It would probably be okay if they cut their work-force into sections, working on different games rather than just one, but they seem to want to throw their assets all at their MOBA (Which I think is sad that it's not on Steam... I actuall could use my wallet here for "skins" and gods...)\n\nMy recomendation: If you're giving it a shot, go ahead! It's still a fun, yet frustraiting game! However, I would caution you to play a "hat sim" or other arena shooter that is actually maintained.","April 10, 2014","false","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It has complex and interesting maps, and while there is a steep learning curve for weapons in the game, it's far more rewarding than in other games to get a kill.  Sadly, it is clearly a game developed around microtransactions, and it takes an absurd amount of time to get that one weapon you've been eyeing.  Due to that fact, the majority of players have moved on from Ascend, and it's slowly fading out.  While not a bad game in its own right, due to the recent lack of players and neglect from the developers, I can't recommend this game.","June 5, 2013","false","161.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

And still do. People should still play this game, even if it doesn't have too many people left, which is one of it's two major problems, the other being the devs, who have seemingly left the game for dead. The class system works quite well in my opinion. If you want to sneak around and backstab people, you have Infiltrator. If you want to use brute force (pun intended), use the Brute. Technician is a great support class if you want to tactical strike bases, or if you want to spawn vehicles and be able to repair them. Overall is balanced well and weapons don't take forever to unlock, which is nice.       I still recommend, even with declining population.","January 18, 2015","true","240.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Sorta. Instead of there being the 9 classes from before the devs have gone back to the original system that uses the three armour types as the classes, much like the older games released by Dynamix and Irrational and Hi-Rez (the devs) improved on it in just about every way.\n\nEach armour type has their own set of weapons, grenades and packs. From the generic light, medium and heavy variants  of some weapons to weapons that only that armour type can use, such as a rocket launcher for the heavy or the throwing knives for the light.\n\nCalldowns have been removed and the item that was used as the calldown laser has been reused as the targeting laser or range finder from Tribes 2 and the deployable inventory station has been changed from a calldown to a pack-style deployable much like the older games.\n\nThe vehicle play remains pretty much un-altered but credits have been removed so they're are free, although credits are still used as part of your score in game.\n\nIn addition to the old armour system returning you can also carry up to 3 weapons as light and medium or 4 as heavy, weapons are also selected with your number keys instead of a single cycle weapon binding.\n\nAlthough there are some bugs and problems with the game as a result of these major changes such as every weapon not being unlocked for every slot and loadout for each class and some of the server options no longer working because the functions related to them are no longer there.\n\nWeapons are no longer upgradeable so when you buy a weapon their stats don't go up or down through using it and the perk system has also been removed aswell.\n\nIn short i'd say Tribes Ascend now lives up to the previous titles in the series and is well worth the download. Hopfully Hi-Rez puts this much effort into the next Tribes-esque game they release.","December 13, 2015","true","25.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Yes, you read that right: your (energy-) ski! This aspect defines the entire game and poses the main difference to other games. The Tribes series was always centered around the gamemode "Capture the Flag" and offers fast and frantic battles, where aiming is as important as maneuvering the terrain: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slG0UWSiloY\nIt's difficult to describe this movement mechanic with words, so take a look at it in the following video. Attention! Playing Tribes requires some skill, therefore always remember: practice makes perfect!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lrSVumR7l8\nThere are 9 different classes (light to heavy) with class-specific weapons, items, perks and killstreaks. Most weapons shoot explosive rounds, which are quite useful for highspeed battles. The light classes are the fastest on the battlefield and are designed for attack maneuvers, while the heavy classes are mostly designed for defending your flag / base / domination-spot. There are also 3 different vehicles that can be bought with points (from kills and objectives) on some maps. The video below shows some weapons in action: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcNnU3D5rHc\nTribes Ascend features multiple gamemodes including:\n\n- Capture the Flag\nCTF-gamemode with bases. Both teams have a base with turrets, radar, vehicle station and a generator. These "structures" can be destroyed to get an advantage when stealing the enemy's flag (there's also an engineer class to repair them).\n\n- Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch\nDM and TDM games with highspeed pursuits. In TDM the first dead player drops a flag and the team that carries the flag gets double points for kills.\n\n- Dominition\nCapture and defend spots.\n\nYou should definetely try it if you're interested in the game. You can't go wrong with free games afterall.","January 1, 2014","true","2.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

If you loved the series, you'll get some mileage out of it. But for everyone else, the time has already passed.\n\nThe game mechanics are solid, and it's still very much an enjoyable shooter. If you do get into it, look for the GOTY pack on sale, as it'll give you more than enough content for your money, and is much preferred to the grind or solo purchases.\n\nThat said, HiRez dropped support for this (among their other games) to focus on Smite, their new money-maker. While I can't entirely blame them, it still sucks. And with Tribes, it shows... the servers are mostly empty (though you can usually get a few games in without much wait) and there are no more updates.\n\nWhile a lot of fun at its core, due to the ended support, lack of care from HiRez about the game and grind needed to get into it... for all by the most desperate for some Tribes-y action (I think there's an original Tribes resurgence, so go look at that instead), Tribes: Ascend is sadly a pass.","January 17, 2015","false","15.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfhadfajaeje/recommended/17080/","dfhadfajaeje","Tadpole","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfhadfajaeje/","140 products in account","Take the name of Tribes, use the old movement mechanics, but completely butcher the customization by "streamlining" it, add a pinch of the "modern fps" and you get the mess called Tribes Ascend. Basically they took the name of Tribes and some gameplay aspects but completely screwed it up with premade loadouts that can't be changed like you could do in good old Starsiege: Tribes and Tribes 2. Playing Tribes Ascend might give a hint what the FPS gaming used to be like in the good old days but it will never be the same.\n\nThe "modernized weapons" (shotguns, assault rifles) and their magazines are questionable additions as are perks that mainly serve as incentive to keep grinding at the game and clearly only serve as pandering to all the "modern" fps gamers. Combine those with the ♥♥♥♥ poor loadout customization and the stage is set for disaster to any old Tribes veteran.\n\nDevs also have abandoned Tribes for Smite so there are no upcoming changes to the game and it is not being maintained with regular patches.\n\nAll in all game has good mechanics, the pace and aesthetics of a Tribes game are there but the restricted loadout customization is what kills the game atleast for me. Might not sound like a lot, but people who haven't played previous iterations just have no idea how much fun the old game was for me. I understand that the devs might just wanted to make something "new" by "streamlining" the gameplay. Some might tell me to go play the old game if I loved it so much, but since Dynamix studio was closed by Sierra, the support for the game was removed and the game died out quickly. Similar fate seems to have fallen onto Tribes Ascend.\n\nThe best aspects of T:A are certainly the fact that they managed to capture the feel and flow of the old Tribes games. I just despise the grind aspect they added along with the poor loadout customization options and "modern fps" additions. Instead of just making customizable skins and looks that could be sold so f2p could make some money, they decided to put weapons and loadouts behind paywalls or a grindwalls. Naturally they wanted to add more stuff to the market place and so were born some of the dumbest and uninnovative "alternative" guns that are basically just like the default but with stats slightly changed around.\n\nMy verdict? If you haven't played Tribes, give it a go. It is free to play after all and it gives you an idea what it used to be like. If you loved the old Tribes, you might enjoy this one for a while but it will get stale fast. Should you spend money on it? Definitely not. Atleast not until they start supporting it again. Give it a go and see it for yourself. I didn't like it, hence the thumbs down.\n\nI played Tribes Ascend for a while before it came to steam and I had to write this review here because of the love I had with Tribes 1 and Tribes 2 and especially its renegade mod. I grew up with games and instead of chasing girls as teen-early 20's I chased the flag in Tribes 1 and Tribes 2. I have nothing but sweet golden memories of those days. They just screwed it up with Tribes Ascend. I'm so sour and disappointed how it turned out. They just don't make games like they used to.

The studio got a lot of flak for moving its focus over to another risky endeavour, which is the MOBA Smite, which paid off after Smite saw a lot of commercial success and propelled the studio from a small 20-man staff to employing over 80 people.\n\nI recommend playing Tribes: Ascend without hesitation, as it is the best online shooter I've ever played, and in spite of some balancing issues, and lack of studio support, I will continue playing for as long as the servers don't burst into flames and die, at which point the game will probably die too.\n\nGo in, have fun, shoot people, and try not to rage too much when hyper-skilled players gun you down with automatic weapons 4 times over.

The studio got a lot of flak for moving its focus over to another risky endeavour, which is the MOBA Smite, which paid off after Smite saw a lot of commercial success and propelled the studio from a small 20-man staff to employing over 80 people.\n\nI recommend playing Tribes: Ascend without hesitation, as it is the best online shooter I've ever played, and in spite of some balancing issues, and lack of studio support, I will continue playing for as long as the servers don't burst into flames and die, at which point the game will probably die too.\n\nGo in, have fun, shoot people, and try not to rage too much when hyper-skilled players gun you down with automatic weapons 4 times over. It's a lot of fun if you play it for fun.","June 6, 2014","true","695.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The map is extremely open and you feel really bawesome skiing and jetpacking your way extremely quickly through an enemy fort. This is really tricky to stop but also satisfying, and you don't just have your fast battles requiring accuracy. When you try to shut down the enemy generator to limit their powers, that means that you can have the normal types of battles you are used to, and you can use the slower more explode-y weapons. The vehicles some say are underwhelming, and that depends on how they are priced. There's the slow tanky beowulf, the fast motorbike, and the shrike, which is your flying vehicle that is not for everyone. The call-ins are probably better. You can make recourse drops and also call in slow but extremely powerful strikes from the air.","August 19, 2014","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I generally hate free to play because "free to play" usually means "pay/grind to win". As a long-time tribes fan (since tribes 1), this put me off almost as much as tribes:vengeance did.\n\nHowever I gave it a shot.\n\nIts actually VERY good. It would be perfect if it wasn't F2P (I would gladly pay full price upfront for all content) but the F2P here isnt that intrusive - you can get by decently without much grinding.\n\nThis game IS tribes. The jetpacks, disc launchers, and voice binds. Flying over hills at ridiculous speeds and landing a midair hit on someone is really.♥♥♥♥ing.satisyfing. The adrenalin rush of being the flag carrier with 5 enemies chasing you at crazy speeds; it was a dopamine/nostalgia overload on my first play.\n\nIn hindsight, this game needed to be F2P/grind based in order to build a large enough community to keep the servers worth playing in. I only wish they added more CTF maps.\n\nDefinitely try this out (or you're missing out).","July 18, 2012","true","137.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most shooting games put the players in a slow-paced environment where the desire to move quicker than 7 mph is not an option. In this game, if you're moving slower than that, it's because you're standing still.\n\nThis game requires a good aim, reflex, tracking, and anticipation. Most of your gameplay will require that you anticipate. There are enormous hills all over the place, and between the "skiing" and jetpack abilities, there's really no way you'll have to NOT anticipate before shooting.\n\nIt also features several cameos and essences I really enjoy, even one relating directly to Sonic the Hedgehog (the best video game series ever). Several voices and  statements and whatnot from prior games were dragged into this game, and better yet, you can control the exact statement you use, unlike previous games in the Tribes series.\n\nAs a First-Person Shooter game, I give it a 10/10, hands down. Most shooters I play get around 5/10. As a video game altogether, I give it 9/10, graphics and physics and originality and whatever else factors all considered. From a PERSONAL standpoint, I give it a 6/10. It's something I like to play, but not very often. Games are meant for fun, aaaaaaaaaand that's how I tend to rate games on a personal level. This game is a LOT of fun, especially to someone who hasn't played a Tribes game in 9 years or so when they find out this one is free.

It has high quality graphics, 9 different classes, and a free to play system that is less Pay-2-Win than most.\n\nPros:\n\n-The game looks great\n-Tons of different weapons and items to unlock\n-No Storyline so maximum replayability\n-A community much better than COD or those types of games\n-Gameplay that is often based on skill\n\nCons:\n\n-The system may not be Pay-2-Win, but paying for the Game of the Year gives noobs an advantage over other noobs because certain unlockables are straight upgrades.\n-The classes are NOT balanced. Certain classes are ridiculously strong while others are borderline underpowered. That being said, a pro can make any of these classes work but they would do better using a good class\n-Although generally based on skill, some of the more overpowered classes simply rely on pressing a button to win\n-Weapons are not balanced either, with stock weapons that aren't even used.\n-Unlocks cost an exceptional amount. Certain unlocks that are required to play a subclass (Chaser on Pathfinder for example) require you to earn over 40 games worth of exp.\n\nThat being said, this game is still a great FPS, easily kicking COD and those cookie-cutters right off the map.","January 1, 2014","true","34.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yirus/recommended/17080/","yirus","Dat Yirus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yirus/","131 products in account","This game is a free fast-paced FPS with mostly ballistic weapons and awesome movement mechanics including jetpacks and a complete friction loss from the ground. And because gliding + hills + speed + ballistic weapons = hard to hit, this game is difficult. And awesome.\nNow to get a little more precise, the movement can be compared with the little iOS game tiny wings, where you slide through the little gaps between round hills and fly around as fast as you can, but this is 3D. The weapons are mostly in one of these 3 categories: Explosive weapons fire slowly, have rather slowly flying projectiles with splash damage and extreme damage on a direct hit, while bullet based guns (autos) fire rather fast flying little projectiles dealing high damage per second if you manage to hit all shots and the usually weakest but easy to aim hitscan weapons, which work as all guns do in "modern shooters". You point at an enemy and when you click, they die.\nAs you may have guessed, to be good at the game you should be able to handle guns from the first category, which are the way it's meant to be played and the only real honorable option (Debatable, I know, discuss it on reddit or whatever). The fast movement is hard to control in the beginning and hitting fast people with ballistic weapons can be extremely hard. This is what puts game's skill ceiling so high.\nThe community is not as big as it used to be, by now the game is slowly dying ( http://steamcharts.com/app/17080#All ). Still, there's always enough EU servers filled to join in a suitable game for me, so I will be enjoying the game for a long time. The good players are friendly to each other, the few toxic parts of the community are found in low-level servers and quit plaing sooner or later. Your first matches will be on these novice servers, although you will soon reach level 10 just to be thrown into games with the seasoned veterans when you know little about the game but the basics. This makes it even harder for new players.\n\nSo, to come to a conclusion:\nThe game is awesome, but difficult.\nWe can use more new players learning with each other instead of getting wrecked by pros, so give it a try.\nWhat you can have for free is one of the best multiplayer shooters out there.\nPrepare to get owned! Don't be frustrated, it's bound to happen.\nContinue playing and think about what you do, learn from the enemy and you will get better.\n\nHave fun!","May 31, 2014","true","362.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yirus/recommended/17080/","yirus","Dat Yirus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yirus/","131 products in account","This game is a free fast-paced FPS with mostly ballistic weapons and awesome movement mechanics including jetpacks and a complete friction loss from the ground. And because gliding + hills + speed + ballistic weapons = hard to hit, this game is difficult. And awesome.\nNow to get a little more precise, the movement can be compared with the little iOS game tiny wings, where you slide through the little gaps between round hills and fly around as fast as you can, but this is 3D. The weapons are mostly in one of these 3 categories: Explosive weapons fire slowly, have rather slowly flying projectiles with splash damage and extreme damage on a direct hit, while bullet based guns (autos) fire rather fast flying little projectiles dealing high damage per second if you manage to hit all shots and the usually weakest but easy to aim hitscan weapons, which work as all guns do in "modern shooters". You point at an enemy and when you click, they die.\nAs you may have guessed, to be good at the game you should be able to handle guns from the first category, which are the way it's meant to be played and the only real honorable option (Debatable, I know, discuss it on reddit or whatever). The fast movement is hard to control in the beginning and hitting fast people with ballistic weapons can be extremely hard. This is what puts game's skill ceiling so high.\nThe community is not as big as it used to be, by now the game is slowly dying ( http://steamcharts.com/app/17080#All ). Still, there's always enough EU servers filled to join in a suitable game for me, so I will be enjoying the game for a long time. The good players are friendly to each other, the few toxic parts of the community are found in low-level servers and quit plaing sooner or later. Your first matches will be on these novice servers, although you will soon reach level 10 just to be thrown into games with the seasoned veterans when you know little about the game but the basics. This makes it even harder for new players.\n\nSo, to come to a conclusion:\nThe game is awesome, but difficult.\nWe can use more new players learning with each other instead of getting wrecked by pros, so give it a try.\nWhat you can have for free is one of the best multiplayer shooters out there.\nPrepare to get owned! Don't be frustrated, it's bound to happen.\nContinue playing and think about what you do, learn from the enemy and you will get better.\n\nHave fun!","May 31, 2014","true","362.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Vehicles can be acquired by spending "XP" earned in matches (XP resets every match). This game is good enough that I still play it, but IMO, the match-making should be better.

It's either zoom or hipfire, much like Halo.\n\n-If you don't ski and/or use your jetpack, and play this like CoD or Battlefield, you're gonna be dead quick.\n\n-The maps are large, so you'll need to use your enhanced movement to get around quicker.\n\ntl:dr: Much better than Smite, although the developer has abandoned the game.","January 9, 2014","true","33.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

A combination of the lack of new content and FTP aspect (though the pricing/structure are quite fair imo) seem to be responsible for this. While this game did change some things from previous Tribes, I think that Hi-Rez did a good job keeping most things faithful to the series. There are still a good number of players on servers, but it has certainly passed it's most active/best times.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thracks/recommended/17080/","thracks","thrx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thracks/","355 products in account","Tribes: Ascend is a masterful shooter title hailing from a legendary pedigree. Beginning with 1998's "Starsiege: Tribes," the franchise is best known for pioneering the singularly unique concept of "skiing," which has grown from an abuse of a broken physics engine to the defining characteristic of the universe.\n\nPlayers in Tribes: Ascend may--and should at all times--ski. This absolutely frictionless mode of movement obligates players to intelligently harness their jetpacks and the geometry of the terrain--and their concussive weaponry--to sustain breakneck speeds in excess of 250 sanics (Tribes lingo for KPH).  Billed as the world's fastest shooter, "GOTTA GO FAST" serves as both a community rallying cry and a warning.\n\nFree-to-play, but not pay-to-win, Ascend complements its utterly distinctive gameplay with excitingly diverse classes and weaponry that may be upgraded with experience gained through play. Complete with large servers and superb maps, Ascend is a breath of fresh air.","July 18, 2012","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Maps are well made and offer many tactical advantages (and disatvantages) as well as very intresting features which make them "alive". While playing, you can really feel like you are engaged in entire planet-wide conflict. There are 9 classes in game, 3 light classes, 3 medium classes and 3 heavy classes which have their own way of playing. If you are more agile type of player, you will certanly enjoy navigating rough terrain in the role of pathfinder light class (as well as snatching enemy flag right in front of their noses!). If you seek well rounded and generaly easy to play class, the soldier medium class is for you. Or if you had tough day at work or are just angry about something, you will enjoy tearing enemy base to bits in the role of juggernaut heavy class. Gameplay is, as stated before, dinamic and it is skill based. You don't just shoot like a maniac, you need to predict where your target will be to score a hit. You will always need to keep in mind your energy level and your speed - slow soldier is a dead soldier. Game is not a pay 2 win in any case, you can buy some things for real money but they are cosmetic (skins, voices).\n\nHowever, Tribes: Ascend has its sad and dark side. Player base is getting smaller each day, last update was released 3 years ago beacuse the devs are (for some reason unknown) decided to abandon the game. Once ambitious, glorious game has been thrown into state of decay.\n\nAll in all, the game offers a lot, its not a mindless shooter or ultra-super-skilled-players-only game, in terms of action, fun, and tactical possibilities, there is no other game that can match Tribes:Ascend.","March 15, 2015","true","36.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While everyone figured they abandoned the game (which, they pretty much did for a while there), they came out of no where with this new patch.  And it puts the feel of the old school Tribes games back in.  Gone are the individual classes, back with just the light/medium/heavy sets and customizable loadouts.  There's been a slew of quality improvements as well as a couple new maps.  I definitely feel like I'm playing a graphically and mechanically updated version of the beloved Starsiege Tribes from the late 90s, which is fantastic.  A lot of F2P games get you with their IAPs and P2W, but even HiRez has admitted they're not going to make money off this patch.  They've basically given the old players everything in the game completely unlocked.  You shouldn't spend more than $10 on the game unless you're just impatient, as it appears everything (except armor skins and voice packs) are unlockable via XP.  I can't not recommend this game to fans of the FPS genre, because the bottom line is it's just that good.","October 7, 2012","true","24.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thenefarious/recommended/17080/","thenefarious","TheNefarious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thenefarious/","63 products in account","A great game.\n\nHISTORY:\nTribes is an old franchise that goes all the way to 1999 with Starsiege: Tribes. It differentiated itself from other futuristic shooters by having wide open maps, vehicles, class system (similar to what Battlefield 1942 did 3 years later) and jetpacks. Then later on, Tribes 2 came and further expanded on the idea, adding skiing (which is one of the few cases of a bug becoming a core feature of a franchise). It was well received and a couple of years later, Tribes: Vengeance came out and it was the first attempt to try streamlining the formula, however it wasn't well received by fans. And so, Tribes IP languished year after year, at one time developer called GarageGames (who made Fallen Empire: Legions, heavily (by heavily I mean almost completely copied) inspired by Tribes) bought the IP with the intent of remaking Tribes 1 for their InstantAction platform (which might be defunct now), til Hi-Rez bought the rights and set on to develop Tribes: Ascend.\n\nBASICS:\nTribes: Ascend can be best described as "Battlefield meets Halo, fast-paced". It is a first-person shooter which pits teams Blood Eagle between treacherous Diamond Sword, each team can have max. 14 players with 3 armor classes in disposal. It is very team-oriented (as you might've noticed) and each player needs to accomodate and communicate between teammates to win. It's not as easy to learn as other games in the genre, you need to have at least some knowledge of the game, but it is gratifying as you soar into the sky with your jetpack and then ski 200 km/h (or is it mph), get into duels and so on.\n\nGAME MODES:\nThere are many game types you can play, however the main type of Tribes: Ascend is Capture-the-flag. Each team fights for other team's flag and 5 captured flags end the game or if the time runs out with the score difference of two or one without other team holding the flag. Team Deathmatch is also widely played and recommended for newbies to try out. There are other game types like CTF Blitz (changing flag positions), Arena (akin to Quake's Clan Arena)... The maps are gorgeous and vast and the action feels really good, with plenty of weapons to wield (which need to be unlocked though).\n\nPROGRESS:\nUPDATE: Completely overhauled experience system. Now it's far easier for newer players to learn the games because pay-to-win elements have been unlocked. Grinding has been removed, everything not cosmetic is unlocked from the start. The whole loadout system has been rebalanced. So kudos to Hi-Rez.\n\nCIRCUMSTANCES:\nThe community playing this game is rather small. Hi-Rez cut support for the game a few years back because it was "complete" (even though there are still bugs that need some work, Hi-Rez mismanaged the game and consequently many players have left the game, but with the rebalancing I highly recommend that you come back.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\n+ Fast-paced action\n+ Beautiful maps\n+ A rather successful attempt to modernize the Tribes formula\n+ Not pay-to-win (anymore)\n\n- Small number of players for now\n- Not as easy to pick up as other FPS's\n\nMy rating:\n8 / 10\n\nP.S. After you play few matches to get a grip on the game, I suggest you to head over to tribesascendwiki.com and tribes.wikia.com for class guides and other information and check out playapug.com for finding pick-up games (organized, but casual games).","August 4, 2014","true","89.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But then I decided to get Smite as well. Also made by Hi-Rez Studios. Got Smite, but never played it or Tribes: Ascend. Decided to start up Tribes one day. Got an error message saying "This game must be launched through Steam" even though that's what I had done in the first place. Launcher for Tribes still starts up but there are missing textures, and there is a static progress bar labeled: Connecting to authentication servers, or somthing of the sort. Trys to relaunch game. Same thing happens. Tries reinstalling it. Same thing happens. Tries uninstalling Smite. Same thing happens. Tries reinstalling Tribes again. Launcher actually works to some extent, but with the same missing texture problem. After installing, I launch the game. Missing gui and textures everywhere. Cursor does not appear. Most likely due to missing textures as well. Manages to join session of Capture the Flag. Models are there but all the textures are gone. Manages to exit game feeling very dissapointed. Goes to store page to write this review. Decides to reinstall the game once more after the review is done. Ok, now I really like this game, and that is the reason I still reccomend it. But this problem needs to be fixed. I'm not sure if the textures didn't download correctly and the launcher didn't notice the problem, or if they were somehow put in the wrong folder in the game directory, but I'm fairly certain that this has happened to at least one other person in the world. Thank you for reading this review. Spread the word to your friends, and tell them to tell their friends and their friends will tell their friends and so on. Tell them that they are not alone in the world of bugs, and glitches, and mishaps in programming. Tell them that help is (hopefully) coming from the developers.

The speed and intense gameplay are second to none, and the game is utterly mesmerising to play at a high level. The game however has suffered from the developers decision with additions that destroyed a lot of the games balance and ruined many of the classes roles. Before then abandoning it for another IP they had also been creating (SMITE). This is a sad thing due to the potential the game had right from the start. With a solid base like it had at launch the game could have well been one of the premiere competitive FPS games out there. With a large playerbase it fundimentally was already there, but the poor balancing and choice of weapons fundimentally ruined the game and it's current state is not much fun.\n\nI'd like it if HI-Rez actually did come back and resolved the games concurrent issues and took it foward. That or another company got the rights to the Tribes brand and developed it. I'd gladly drop more money on this game any day, if it was developed with the proper care and attention to the game itself.","April 9, 2015","false","25.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IrukSNAFU/recommended/17080/","IrukSNAFU","Dijkstra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IrukSNAFU/","228 products in account","EDIT: The Out of the Blue patch has improved this game immensely, bringing it more in line with Tribes and Tribes 2. However, there still are some balance issues, but much more concerning is the still-dwindling player base. Hi Rez has shown they've not completely forgotten about the game, but now they need to show they're commited to actually making it a good one. Check out all the new changes, and keep an eye on the game. Hopefully things continue to improve.\n\nAn interesting title that's more a mixed bag than anything. Flashy graphics and unique mechanics provide lots of fun, but the massive xp costs for the countless amount of unlocks turns what would be a solid FPS into a frustrating grind fest. Not to mention, the learning curve is extremely steep; between learning all the weapon behaviors and skiing, there's a rather large barrier of entry for a newcomer. However, the DOTA- and CS-like difficulty is compounded by the xp grind and feeling of helplessness against those who have arguably "better" unlocks and more time with the game. Granted, mastering skiing and grinding for the unlocks will certainly keep you coming back, the former being genuinely fun and the latter having the same addictiveness for completionists.\n\nThe classic F2P microtransation system really forces you to start pumping money in to bolster your arsenal. You'll have so little if you solely unlock through grinding that you're likely to never know what you actually prefer otherwise. For those inclined to do so can use Steam Wallet funds to purchase Tribes Gold in-game. This allows you to unlock weapons, classes and perks much faster than by grinding alone.\n\nHowever, putting money into this does leave a bad taste in your mouth. The game does feel like it's slowly expiring, so spending money on the myriad of arguably better and/or necessary unlocks also quickly kills the desire to play. Having dropped $20 in my 30 hours of play has left me little fulfillment. More often than not, I'll want to play, but the sense of aversion due to the xp grind and complete chaos in pubs keeps me from hitting the play button now.\n\nHackers are both stupidly obvious and game breaking. One will ruin a game entirely; ironically, this is usually the best way to grind xp. Furthermore, despite the potential for large and hectic matches, even the normal 12vs12 games feel sparsely populated, every player preferring to go at it lone-wolf. This frequently results in both team having one or two players with better unlocks capping uninterrupted or camping your generator. The only time it feels like people are truly working together is when it's hardcore players stomping your team.\n\nVehicles also don't seem to be touched at all, another disappointment considering the amazing potential they can have. The vehicle pad screams for more attention. Of the three (yes, only three - that doesn't even fill the list space!) vehicles you can purchase during a match, two are bland, expected additions that most games in this genre will have. The Grav Cycle is the best of the three, but still pales compared to other vehicles seen in FPS games in the past decade.\n\nI find myself picking it up every so often because despite its issues I really do want to enjoy this game. As you perfect your skiing and get better at predicting shots, there is some degree of redemption afforded the game? Those one-in-a-million shots are extremely gratifying, and high-speed chases are thrilling. Unfortunately, for a game so young, it seems to be suffering from the same fate many significantly older games are: a dwindling player base and no new official content. While Tribes fans may be able to look past the flaws to play a game bearing the series name with a modern paintjob, after a certain point the enjoyment of mid-air spinfusor directs simply can't produce enough draw to boot the game again. Whether that's after 5, 50, or 500 hours is dependent on how much you like the franchise.\n\nSadly, Tribes: Ascend is only really recommendable to the intensely curious who won't mind the grinding and frustration or the long-time fans who'll buy the GOTY version. For a game with so much potential, it really feels the weight of its awards have crushed it. It's had its 15 minutes of fame and has ceased being profitable for the developer. Without a support team to keep it patched, hacker free, and fresh with new content, Tribes: Ascend is simply crumbling under its own weight.\n\nI love this game but it hates me. The Tribes franchise deserved better.","January 21, 2014","false","356.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The main attraction is their "Capture the Flag" mode, which is the most intense game of CTF one will ever experience due to the game's unique playing style: a mix of futuritsic "skiing" or "gliding" over vast mountainous playing fields at high speeds. Combine that with precise and challenging shooting at the correct angle and direction to hit the other opponent and finally the correct tactics and timing for offense and defense between your teammates and the opposing force.\n\nTo top it all off, the game also has excellent graphics, sound, and a fairly large multiplayer community. The game is free to play and upgraded weapons and other items can be unlocked through normal play time, but you can unlock things early through their online store. If you're looking for your next great multiplayer shooter that will challenge you a little more than the average Call of Duty or something similar, then this is your game and it wont cost you a penny!\n\nMy only major gripe with the game is that they made the red team's armor look very menacing and cool where as the blue team's armor is sort of "light" looking like padding on a soccer player or something. As a result, a lot of players always play as the red team because they hate the look of blue team and the games will often be in favor of the red team... I really wish the developers would have made red and blue armor look the same to avoid a problem like that... sort of like what Valve did with Team Fortress 2 where both red and blue teams look the same, just different colors. Still as an overall package i think the game deserves a solid 8 or 9 out of 10.","September 16, 2013","true","267.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Maps are well made and offer many tactical advantages (and disatvantages) as well as very intresting features which make them "alive". While playing, you can really feel like you are engaged in entire planet-wide conflict. There are 9 classes in game, 3 light classes, 3 medium classes and 3 heavy classes which have their own way of playing. If you are more agile type of player, you will certanly enjoy navigating rough terrain in the role of pathfinder light class (as well as snatching enemy flag right in front of their noses!). If you seek well rounded and generaly easy to play class, the soldier medium class is for you. Or if you had tough day at work or are just angry about something, you will enjoy tearing enemy base to bits in the role of juggernaut heavy class. Gameplay is, as stated before, dinamic and it is skill based. You don't just shoot like a maniac, you need to predict where your target will be to score a hit. You will always need to keep in mind your energy level and your speed - slow soldier is a dead soldier. Game is not a pay 2 win in any case, you can buy some things for real money but they are cosmetic (skins, voices).\n\nHowever, Tribes: Ascend has its sad and dark side. Player base is getting smaller each day, last update was released 3 years ago beacuse the devs are (for some reason unknown) decided to abandon the game. Once ambitious, glorious game has been thrown into state of decay.\n\nAll in all, the game offers a lot, its not a mindless shooter or ultra-super-skilled-players-only game, in terms of action, fun, and tactical possibilities, there is no other game that can match Tribes:Ascend.","March 15, 2015","true","36.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The high speed of the players, combined with all the weapons having travel time, makes for some very difficult shots. The adrenaline rush of this game is very exciting, and the satisfaction of pulling off that impossible shot is rewarding. The graphics are beautiful, with Ultra settings rivaling top names graphics. On lowest settings, an AMD A8 mobile APU can run it with ease. The gamplay is very good, as i mentioned before. There are several classes, including assault rifle, sniper, and several other classics, along with unique classes. The classes are customizable to a certain degree. This multiplayer in this game is great, and I'm not experiencing any lag at all.\n\nA lot of people are saying this game is dead, but that's the farthest thing from the truth. There's still a small community of us who still play and enjoy this game. Yes if it were opened up by the developers or the P2W features were removed it would be way better but this game is still incredibly enjoyable as-is.

It has Jetpacks, that should be enough to convince you for starters, but if it's not, then it's also one of the only games where almost none of the wepons are hitscan, everything fires actual projectiles, even SMG's, so you have to lead and predict targets adding a much needed boost to skill ceiling and satisfaction on success that FPS games have been lacking lately. Nothing beats the feeling of landing that long range mid-air spinfusor shot. You can also get a bit of a boost to unlocking stuff by liking tribes on facebook and signing up for the game using a refferal link like https://account.hirezstudios.com/tribesascend/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥=1322159&utm_campaign=email to get you some bonus XP at level 6 (and me too).

Tribes Ascend is very fast paced and revolves around team based gameplay, as well as lone-gunning. I would recommend this game to anyone who has played any of the old-school arena type shooters, or anyone who likes fast paced gameplay that seperates itself from the rest of the pack. As far as a multi-player only free to play game, I would rate it a 9/10. The game is very good, but the developers have pretty much abandoned the project, so don't expect any upcoming updates, or to have very many people online at one time.

I did play the old games which is why Im complaining.\n\nIssue 1\nYou need a stupid good video card to work this game. Sure, in the trailers it looks cool, but I set all my video to MINIMAL and still lagged off the game. Yikes.\n\nIssue 2\nGameplay. This game is Planetside 2, slower. You have to play for HOURS to be anywhere NEAR killing anyone. I got my 5 kills (3 of which were assists) by finishing off people. That's it. Its ridiculous to aim, only good weapons are explosive.\n\nIssue 3\nPrice. This is TF2. A P2W. No joke. If you cant shell out a 2.50 then you are dead meat. Like I said, in Issue 2, everyone s overpowered. And, we cant forget the GOTY Edition is 40 bucks. That's deadlocked. I've never seen a sale.\n\nOverall, its BAD. Sure, you have a jetpack...that lasts fro 15 seconds. The skiing is just gliding down a hill. Its not fun. In the little time I played, I got one weapon. One. The cheapest weapon. I had to play 3 rounds for one measly secondary weapon.\n\nIts not fun. Its not good. I recommend other games, like TF2 and Planetside 2. Though TF2 is P2W, the F2P experience is fun too. Planetside 2 is a sped up, better looking version of this game.\n\nThere. I'm done. Im expecting hate, a lot of hate. But like I said, I DID PLAY THE OLD GAMES.\n\nAnd out of 10? I say 2/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yirus/recommended/17080/","yirus","Dat Yirus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yirus/","131 products in account","This game is a free fast-paced FPS with mostly ballistic weapons and awesome movement mechanics including jetpacks and a complete friction loss from the ground. And because gliding + hills + speed + ballistic weapons = hard to hit, this game is difficult. And awesome.\nNow to get a little more precise, the movement can be compared with the little iOS game tiny wings, where you slide through the little gaps between round hills and fly around as fast as you can, but this is 3D. The weapons are mostly in one of these 3 categories: Explosive weapons fire slowly, have rather slowly flying projectiles with splash damage and extreme damage on a direct hit, while bullet based guns (autos) fire rather fast flying little projectiles dealing high damage per second if you manage to hit all shots and the usually weakest but easy to aim hitscan weapons, which work as all guns do in "modern shooters". You point at an enemy and when you click, they die.\nAs you may have guessed, to be good at the game you should be able to handle guns from the first category, which are the way it's meant to be played and the only real honorable option (Debatable, I know, discuss it on reddit or whatever). The fast movement is hard to control in the beginning and hitting fast people with ballistic weapons can be extremely hard. This is what puts game's skill ceiling so high.\nThe community is not as big as it used to be, by now the game is slowly dying ( http://steamcharts.com/app/17080#All ). Still, there's always enough EU servers filled to join in a suitable game for me, so I will be enjoying the game for a long time. The good players are friendly to each other, the few toxic parts of the community are found in low-level servers and quit plaing sooner or later. Your first matches will be on these novice servers, although you will soon reach level 10 just to be thrown into games with the seasoned veterans when you know little about the game but the basics. This makes it even harder for new players.\n\nSo, to come to a conclusion:\nThe game is awesome, but difficult.\nWe can use more new players learning with each other instead of getting wrecked by pros, so give it a try.\nWhat you can have for free is one of the best multiplayer shooters out there.\nPrepare to get owned! Don't be frustrated, it's bound to happen.\nContinue playing and think about what you do, learn from the enemy and you will get better.\n\nHave fun!","May 31, 2014","true","362.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Anyways, let's get to the point! :D\nPros-\n-Brings back old Arena type of shooter games, bringing the old gamemode back to players who've been gaming for decades.\n-Balanced classes. The classes are equally balanced, and have a very unique look for both sides. You can either have a light assualt with high agility with low damage, or heavy damage with weak agility.\n-Vehicles. It isn't like Call of Duty or some other shooter genre where all you do is run and run and grab flag and die. THe vehicles are great, granting you either supreme mobility or heavy firepower. I personally love the Air vehicle(forgot what it's called).\n-The physics. This game uses real life physics, and gives you velocity and all that stuff.\n-Skiing. This game also introduces no friction mode, which allows you to slide on the the surface. It is pretty hard to master, but with lots of practice, you'll get used to it. With the skills with jetpack and skiing, you'll become the best in the game!\nCons-\n-No more updates. This game was released quite a while ago, and have been updated frequently for a while, until March 2013, when the last update we ever saw came out.\nNo other cons :D","July 24, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was also quite good at flag running then, unfortunately I am now trash and the game is very different from what I remember.\n\nBut the things that haven't changed is the fact that it is a fun, fast paced, unforgiving, strategic shooter with loads of rewarding teamplay involved. I was glad to hear that the game is on it's way back from death. It was a noble thing for the developers to do even though they don't stand to make much money out of this. Although some people have mentioned lack of servers, those must be old reviews while the game was still abandoned as I had no trouble finding servers in the US. Since the game is free there is really no reason not to pick it up and try it at the very least and I would recommend doing so.","December 26, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Because of that they left this game to die off never to be touched again.

Some classes feel poorly balanced, the sniper class does less damage than most of the heavy classes, meaning your reward for lining up incredibly difficult shots is almost nonexistant. The 'technician' class seems like it is designed for defends generators and whatnot, but his default weapons are poory suited to dealing with heay/medium armor classes that would attack a generator. It's amost always a good idea to just choose a heavy class, because you live longer and deal the most damage. Supposedly it's balanced through lesser mobility, but that often doesn't matter in the 8 person meelee to pick up a flag or defend an objective.","December 17, 2013","false","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Obviously they have to make money somehow, but all we end up with is a TF2 style game with lots of pointless classes that u have to level (and then comes the requirement to pay to compete). The game in my opinion would be better with a single class, the pathfinder as it's fun and requires skill to use and can complete all the different objectives in the game, such as flag defense and offense.\n\nThe addition of generators and turrets that need repairing is really not that useful. The tech spends most time repairing (it takes 30+ seconds to repair) but it takes 5 seconds to destroy by the "infiltrator" (aka spy) class which can remain hidden for a fair time. So, it takes the tech 1 min 30+ to repair what took the spy class 15 seconds. Eventually you feel it's not worth the effort anymore. Sometimes you can spent ages having a battle with the spy or 2, not even getting outside of the generator room the entire game.\n\nThe heavy class, can sit outside the range of the turrets and destroy them from long range, obsoleting the point of turrets. Another flaw that makes the tech slightly redundant.\n\nThe soldier class has a thumper (aka a sort of grenade launcher) and IIRC a machine gun, making it way stronger than the pathfinder, at least at lower levels.\n\nThe problem with all the other classes is they are too imba and don't require skill. Unfortunately you can find yourself being pummelled by someone who has a weapon with a higher dispersal or a rapid fire weapon, such as SMGs or even chain guns (machine guns).\n\nThere is in fact, no need to go faster in this game because the strongest and most imba classes are the slower ones!\n\nThis game will never become big because the "levelling" element makes it unsuitable for competitive play and the lack of a level playing field, where the difference is in the players skill.","December 17, 2013","false","48.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was fresh, it was exciting, it does things no other title on the market does, like skiing. A breath of fresh air, a new arcade shooter. But once you get past the initial fun, the flaws start showing up.\n\nPhysics are crap: it claims "worlds fastest shooter," but only in pure speed going in a slightly curved line. It's anything but fast-paced due to low gravity and weak jetpacks/acceleration (at full energy, you can't recover if you step off a platform and fall 3 feet). The effect is as though you're playing underwater.\n\nAutomatic weapons are dominant because of this lack of mobility: in a game that has little emphasis on cover, they're not fun or skillful, and 8/10 aren't even needed. This problem is compounded by the fact that bullet hitboxes -for some reason- are larger than 1-shot projectile hitboxes. Even after nerfs, they're still almost double the DPS of explosives and have no spread to curb them.\n\nSee comments for rest of rant.","July 6, 2012","false","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","6"

The game is Beautiful.\n\nOne problem with this game now is that the Developers, HI-REZ  studios decided to take their focus off of this game and put it on their ♥♥♥♥ game Smite.  Because of that they left this game to die off never to be touched again.  Yeah they left it up for the people to mod and keep the game alive but they need to give the game up and let someone better at managing their games handle further development.

You have like 5 minutes of game time! You didn't play the old games!\n\nYes, I did.\n\nI have little game time because I played on an other account that was hacked and I lost the password. I did play the old games which is why Im complaining.\n\nIssue 1\nYou need a stupid good video card to work this game. Sure, in the trailers it looks cool, but I set all my video to MINIMAL and still lagged off the game. Yikes.\n\nIssue 2\nGameplay. This game is Planetside 2, slower. You have to play for HOURS to be anywhere NEAR killing anyone. I got my 5 kills (3 of which were assists) by finishing off people. That's it. Its ridiculous to aim, only good weapons are explosive.\n\nIssue 3\nPrice. This is TF2. A P2W. No joke. If you cant shell out a 2.50 then you are dead meat. Like I said, in Issue 2, everyone s overpowered. And, we cant forget the GOTY Edition is 40 bucks. That's deadlocked. I've never seen a sale.\n\nOverall, its BAD. Sure, you have a jetpack...that lasts fro 15 seconds. The skiing is just gliding down a hill. Its not fun. In the little time I played, I got one weapon. One. The cheapest weapon. I had to play 3 rounds for one measly secondary weapon.\n\nIts not fun. Its not good. I recommend other games, like TF2 and Planetside 2. Though TF2 is P2W, the F2P experience is fun too. Planetside 2 is a sped up, better looking version of this game.\n\nThere. I'm done. Im expecting hate, a lot of hate. But like I said, I DID PLAY THE OLD GAMES.\n\nAnd out of 10? I say 2/10.

I played since early beta and this game has always been underwhelming to the genre and an insult to the franchise. Bland combat, too many automatic weapons, small bland maps, AoE orbital super attacks, vehicles require ingame credits, blatant OP weapons, ignored broken mechanics, out of place "class" system., and now complete developer abandonment.\n\nThey didn't have to copy Tribes 2 word for word, but they probably shouldn't have built it with nothing but broader appeal, and over simplification. This game failed for the same reasons Tribes: vengeance failed. The developer completely forgot what made Tribes 1 and 2 popular. Instead they tried to steal scraps from the tables of other games.","March 31, 2014","false","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/imsoblazed/recommended/17080/","imsoblazed","bLaZeD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/imsoblazed/","99 products in account","I bought the closed beta in October 2011, and having never played any of the original tribes I was hooked. The game was a whole different ballgame than what I've played in the last 15 years. Having come from military shooters, with the exception of some co-op and TF2, I was looking forward to the projectile game as that's all I cared for in TF2 and I never got big in to quake either back in the day.\n\nWhen T:A went F2P I -- like most closed beta -- had high hopes it would be 'the next big thing' but boy we were wrong. As time went on and the game expanded you realized the developers had no idea about anything at all. Map Designers had no logic in their design, no maps made sense as to where you may find assets / repair guns / vehicle pads / inventory stations. Some maps do not even offer vehicles (not talking ones with them disabled). While it's not terribly hard to play the maps a few times and learn them you'll find yourself irritated so much with the fact there's no standardized design for maps. Suiciding will become your friend.\n\nAfter you make peace with terrible map design (to be fair 20-33% aren't too bad, but all lack consistancy you'll find in every major fps) you'll come to realize that the weapons are super inbalanced. The game started off with pretty much projectiles, save the inf (no one used it) and soldier AR. As time moved on everyone got machine guns. This was a big blow to the game in term of longetivity and probably is the main reason it's died. Not only were none of the maps designed with such weapons in everyones hands (no cover to hide from the literal 1-5k bullet spam per 20 seconds) but using a [timed] health regen system on top makes regending impossible unless you camp your base (which is why all pub games are defense).\n\nAnyone who has time logged knows autos are super easy to use, because they have no recoil, no spread. The only one which is implemented in a great way is the pathfinder lar -- because it's limited to 3 shot burst , and with a from-beta-possibly-alpha bug of dry firing you can bank on the person missing a few shots from it not actually firing.\n\nSo on top of horrible map design, and imbalanced/spam weapons not compatable with map terrain or the health system you'll find a few other things that are a bit messed up like the snipers. You'll come to find out about this game there's a few things: Hi-Rez thinks the 2% of people who pug (or "compete" if you want to call it that) are the only people who play here. if you've ever seen a 'competitive' tribes game you'll see 2 things: endless auto spam, and cappers so terrible that the best strategy is to 'punt the flag'. It's why competitve t:a never took off and the only people who play(ed) it are people who can't let go of the game.\n\nOh yes, back to the pug voice dictacting the game flow. So one thing you'll know if you've been around a long time is that snipers are terrible. Terribly easy to play, terribly imbalanced, and have absolutely no place in this game as it sits. They, like most things, were added because 'chasing is too hard for the autospam/flag punting 2%'. I put only a few dozen hours in to sentinel if that and I could consistantly hit the top 5 clans in the game (s1-2) @ 300-400 sanics no problem. The problem with the sniper isn't the 1-3 shot ability; it's that the class generally isn't in any danger because they camp far back. T:A was supposed to be about action, not d stacks and sent camps because no one can catch the flag guy (too logical to fix cap speeds). On top of this, you have numerous bugs still existing from beta, and many of the glitches such as rock bounces added as 'features' due to , again, the 2%. -- This was when I quit.\n\nNow, 3 weeks ago I started playing again with a friend. Sad to say, it got worse. If you're lucky you'll find 5-10 servers with people on them, only to find 1/2 of them are level restricted to 1-10. So you fight over queueing in to 1 of 3-4 servers with the same people. All of them spamming automatics endlessly and spamming the VGS system. You'll see pubstar cappers ending games in 5-0s trying to look good but failing to realize the entire t:a population of < 500 people aren't too interested in capping a flag. Yes, I know, it's CTF. But that's because no other servers exist, and the only TDM I saw was 1-10 restricted.\n\nSo, that about sums up this game. It's totally fun to tinker with casually, but it's never anything to take seriously. The developers used it as a cash cow to fund their next game then dumped it, no mod support even as a thank you. They quit supporting it in June 2013 so it is what it is and that's not much.\n\nI still enjoy tanking auto noobs and blue plating people but you'll find yourself wondering why the same people you see in every server haven't learned how to shoot a projectile well by now.\n\n","April 2, 2014","false","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No more updates, no more content and thanks to ever decreasing player numbers almost no-one to play against.\n\nDisappointing and a real shame.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IrukSNAFU/recommended/17080/","IrukSNAFU","Dijkstra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IrukSNAFU/","228 products in account","EDIT: The Out of the Blue patch has improved this game immensely, bringing it more in line with Tribes and Tribes 2. However, there still are some balance issues, but much more concerning is the still-dwindling player base. Hi Rez has shown they've not completely forgotten about the game, but now they need to show they're commited to actually making it a good one. Check out all the new changes, and keep an eye on the game. Hopefully things continue to improve.\n\nAn interesting title that's more a mixed bag than anything. Flashy graphics and unique mechanics provide lots of fun, but the massive xp costs for the countless amount of unlocks turns what would be a solid FPS into a frustrating grind fest. Not to mention, the learning curve is extremely steep; between learning all the weapon behaviors and skiing, there's a rather large barrier of entry for a newcomer. However, the DOTA- and CS-like difficulty is compounded by the xp grind and feeling of helplessness against those who have arguably "better" unlocks and more time with the game. Granted, mastering skiing and grinding for the unlocks will certainly keep you coming back, the former being genuinely fun and the latter having the same addictiveness for completionists.\n\nThe classic F2P microtransation system really forces you to start pumping money in to bolster your arsenal. You'll have so little if you solely unlock through grinding that you're likely to never know what you actually prefer otherwise. For those inclined to do so can use Steam Wallet funds to purchase Tribes Gold in-game. This allows you to unlock weapons, classes and perks much faster than by grinding alone.\n\nHowever, putting money into this does leave a bad taste in your mouth. The game does feel like it's slowly expiring, so spending money on the myriad of arguably better and/or necessary unlocks also quickly kills the desire to play. Having dropped $20 in my 30 hours of play has left me little fulfillment. More often than not, I'll want to play, but the sense of aversion due to the xp grind and complete chaos in pubs keeps me from hitting the play button now.\n\nHackers are both stupidly obvious and game breaking. One will ruin a game entirely; ironically, this is usually the best way to grind xp. Furthermore, despite the potential for large and hectic matches, even the normal 12vs12 games feel sparsely populated, every player preferring to go at it lone-wolf. This frequently results in both team having one or two players with better unlocks capping uninterrupted or camping your generator. The only time it feels like people are truly working together is when it's hardcore players stomping your team.\n\nVehicles also don't seem to be touched at all, another disappointment considering the amazing potential they can have. The vehicle pad screams for more attention. Of the three (yes, only three - that doesn't even fill the list space!) vehicles you can purchase during a match, two are bland, expected additions that most games in this genre will have. The Grav Cycle is the best of the three, but still pales compared to other vehicles seen in FPS games in the past decade.\n\nI find myself picking it up every so often because despite its issues I really do want to enjoy this game. As you perfect your skiing and get better at predicting shots, there is some degree of redemption afforded the game? Those one-in-a-million shots are extremely gratifying, and high-speed chases are thrilling. Unfortunately, for a game so young, it seems to be suffering from the same fate many significantly older games are: a dwindling player base and no new official content. While Tribes fans may be able to look past the flaws to play a game bearing the series name with a modern paintjob, after a certain point the enjoyment of mid-air spinfusor directs simply can't produce enough draw to boot the game again. Whether that's after 5, 50, or 500 hours is dependent on how much you like the franchise.\n\nSadly, Tribes: Ascend is only really recommendable to the intensely curious who won't mind the grinding and frustration or the long-time fans who'll buy the GOTY version. For a game with so much potential, it really feels the weight of its awards have crushed it. It's had its 15 minutes of fame and has ceased being profitable for the developer. Without a support team to keep it patched, hacker free, and fresh with new content, Tribes: Ascend is simply crumbling under its own weight.\n\nI love this game but it hates me. The Tribes franchise deserved better.","January 21, 2014","false","356.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As far as a multi-player only free to play game, I would rate it a 9/10. The game is very good, but the developers have pretty much abandoned the project, so don't expect any upcoming updates, or to have very many people online at one time.

The speed and intense gameplay are second to none, and the game is utterly mesmerising to play at a high level. The game however has suffered from the developers decision with additions that destroyed a lot of the games balance and ruined many of the classes roles. Before then abandoning it for another IP they had also been creating (SMITE). This is a sad thing due to the potential the game had right from the start. With a solid base like it had at launch the game could have well been one of the premiere competitive FPS games out there. With a large playerbase it fundimentally was already there, but the poor balancing and choice of weapons fundimentally ruined the game and it's current state is not much fun.\n\nI'd like it if HI-Rez actually did come back and resolved the games concurrent issues and took it foward. That or another company got the rights to the Tribes brand and developed it. I'd gladly drop more money on this game any day, if it was developed with the proper care and attention to the game itself.","April 9, 2015","false","25.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you've got time to spare and feel like playing around for a couple hours, this'll do great. You might get disappointed/sad once you realise how much ♥♥♥♥ the devs did outside of gameplay.\n\n\n\nTribes probably wrote the saddest FPS story I've witnessed.\n\nIt's so sad, I'm not gonna make a long explanation out of it. It's a story of how the most promising and fun gameplay concepts got overshadowed by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dev decisions, especially outside of direct gameplay.\n\nMy actual recommendation: At least try this game, if you haven't. Why? Because you should have seen it. I don't think it's an actually recommendable game on the long term, but compare this game's gameplay to a lame ♥♥♥, boring CoD or whatever (those kind of shooters where the concept clearly is "shooting > strategies"). Tribes does have a strategic part to it, but the shooting part is done in such a unique and fun way, it's ridiculous. Whenever I play a FPS that's promoted as "fast", fun or individual and I try it, all I think is "well, it's not Tribes". Hardly any game has similarly entertaining and unique mechanics in it. Balance issues, a kind of p2w system, no mod support and updates that didn't add ♥♥♥♥ to the game make me not want to play this anymore, but I'll never forget the ♥♥♥♥ing sick concepts and potential this game had.","January 14, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

High Speed Fun and Spinfusors for the Win.Genre: Sci-Fi First/Third Person Shooter, Multiplayer Only High Speed Armor Based.\nDeveloped & Published by: Hi-Rez Studios\nPlatform: Windows only.\nDRM: Free Hi-Rez Player Account Required. Steam is optional.\nBusiness Model: Free to Play System. Optional purchases for cosmetic skins, different voices or a weapons pack that unlocks all weapons, perks, items and loadouts immediately.\nPlayed over 100 hours and bought some gold. Most of my playtime is in the non-Steam client. Read this review in its entirety with screenshots and the OST from Bandcamp on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]\n\nGame Overview\nTribes: Ascend is a multiplayer-only online arena high-speed first person shooter. It’s an everlasting factional warfare between the Blood Eagles and Diamond Swords set in the distant future. These tribes are battling it out for ultimate supremacy in a futuristic Sci-Fi universe where the fighting seems unlikely to stop anytime soon. In-game, this simply affects the color of your armor, the announcer’s voice and where you spawn. Three different armor bases form the basis of what a player can and can’t do at any one time. There are a wide variety of different weapons ranging from explosive projectile weapons, hitscan assault weapons to sniper rifles and more. There are five distinct game modes and more than 40 maps combined spanning these modes. These maps are huge, allowing for high speed build up and action on a giant battleground. Each map is designed with its mode in mind and only share the general aesthetics. There is an official rule set for each mode but you can also set up your own server with custom rules. T:A sets itself apart from other first person shooters with high speed skiing, jet pack action and projectile preference over hitscan weapons. It’s free-to-play which means that T:A has a decent variety of skins and voice packs to customize your look as well. Is it worth checking out? Well, let’s talk about the shooting elements next.\n\nGameplay Musing\nWith the Out of The Blue Patch, Hi-Rez has clearly shown that it has learned from the mistakes of the past. The huge amount of grinding is gone, the weapon play feels more balanced than it ever has in the past and Tribes is fun to play again. Despite its quirks and imperfections, Tribes still has something to offer after three years. It’s hard to deny the rush you get when you’re skiing at 300 km/h across the map while dodging all sorts of projectiles thrown your way. The increased flexibility with loadouts makes for a much more interesting play/counterplay setup if the rest of your team is on the ball. I’m not 100% sold on the current weapon or armor balance right now. It’s definitely better than it used to be but some of them, like the bolt launchers, feel superfluous or heavies are a little too good. However, it’s no longer a hitscan nightmare fest that it used to be. Where paid players had a clear advantage over free players. I’ll be curious to see how patches over the months and possibly years go. So far, they seem to be keeping the game going at a regular, if slow, pace.\n\nDevelopment Cycle\nHi-Rez returned in December to give T:A a much needed overhaul in balance and several new maps for players. But that will probably be the exception to the norm. Since then, there’s been smaller bug fix patches, a new map here and there and minor balance changes to address community complaints. Tribes: Ascend seems to be a passion project for Hi-Rez and as such I would temper one’s expectation of regular content. Unfortunately, the Out of the Blue update did not create a substantially larger player base. There was a big jump in players when they announced the patch, but it has since returned to the normal small levels it had before the patch. Even so, the game is playable now without the major issues that used to plague it. I’d say you’ll get about 5-8 public servers going on any particular day. So, there’s always something to do. For now, it seems like Hi-Rez plans on supporting the game for the foreseeable future with small updates to keep the game going.\n\nPC Settings and Audio/Video\nGame Options:What the User Can Configure:Resolution Options: Standards IncludedCategorized by: 16:9, 16:10, 4:3 and Other.Graphics & Texture Detail: Selection SliderMinimal, Low, Medium, High and Very HighV-Sync changeable.

Many of the balance problems are fixed, the large amount of grinding is gone, the business model feels a lot more fair and there’s more content to enjoy. Capture the Flag is clearly the focal point of T:A and its still really fun to play. This is the best state the game has ever been in despite its flaws. The community is still pretty decent too. However, said community is small and may not grow anytime soon unfortunately. There are some aspects of balance that may need to be adjusted as time goes on and I would like to see more content released. It’s also got a pretty difficult learning curve compared to most shooters that can be daunting for new players wanting to experience T:A. While I’ve never gotten particularly great at it, I always try to and its got a challenge that I still find compelling. Its a game whose mechanics, speed and shooting still stand up even after three years of gaming. I definitely recommend checking out Tribes: Ascend especially after this patch that came out of the blue.\n\nRead this review in its entirety with screenshots and OST from Bandcamp on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","March 30","true","28.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Maps are well made and offer many tactical advantages (and disatvantages) as well as very intresting features which make them "alive". While playing, you can really feel like you are engaged in entire planet-wide conflict. There are 9 classes in game, 3 light classes, 3 medium classes and 3 heavy classes which have their own way of playing. If you are more agile type of player, you will certanly enjoy navigating rough terrain in the role of pathfinder light class (as well as snatching enemy flag right in front of their noses!). If you seek well rounded and generaly easy to play class, the soldier medium class is for you. Or if you had tough day at work or are just angry about something, you will enjoy tearing enemy base to bits in the role of juggernaut heavy class. Gameplay is, as stated before, dinamic and it is skill based. You don't just shoot like a maniac, you need to predict where your target will be to score a hit. You will always need to keep in mind your energy level and your speed - slow soldier is a dead soldier. Game is not a pay 2 win in any case, you can buy some things for real money but they are cosmetic (skins, voices).\n\nHowever, Tribes: Ascend has its sad and dark side. Player base is getting smaller each day, last update was released 3 years ago beacuse the devs are (for some reason unknown) decided to abandon the game. Once ambitious, glorious game has been thrown into state of decay.\n\nAll in all, the game offers a lot, its not a mindless shooter or ultra-super-skilled-players-only game, in terms of action, fun, and tactical possibilities, there is no other game that can match Tribes:Ascend.","March 15, 2015","true","36.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't bother.\n\nProblem?\n\nEDIT: After many hours, it turns out that Hi-Rez Studios found its other games far more profitable and interesting. It was too expensive from the get go. They never bothered to address this until the game was almost dead. Its really a shame they killed the Tribes franchise. I'll be honest, it is / was a good game. The developers were just terrible at operating it. In example, at one point to puchase a single primary weapon was 10.00 USD. That is absurd. Eventually it got lowered some, then as the game died, they made a get it all pack. Far too late, HiRez. You won't have any of my money.\n\nThey also stopped addressing gameplay issues and bugs, most of them being weapon balancing. Just look up what happened when the Plasma Rifle was introduced. It was eventually fixed, but from there on out it was a hillarious rollercoaster of balance problems.\n\nI have to unfortunately change my review to "Not Recommend"","July 22, 2012","false","72.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was fresh, it was exciting, it does things no other title on the market does, like skiing. A breath of fresh air, a new arcade shooter. But once you get past the initial fun, the flaws start showing up.\n\nPhysics are crap: it claims "worlds fastest shooter," but only in pure speed going in a slightly curved line. It's anything but fast-paced due to low gravity and weak jetpacks/acceleration (at full energy, you can't recover if you step off a platform and fall 3 feet). The effect is as though you're playing underwater.\n\nAutomatic weapons are dominant because of this lack of mobility: in a game that has little emphasis on cover, they're not fun or skillful, and 8/10 aren't even needed. This problem is compounded by the fact that bullet hitboxes -for some reason- are larger than 1-shot projectile hitboxes. Even after nerfs, they're still almost double the DPS of explosives and have no spread to curb them.\n\nSee comments for rest of rant.","July 6, 2012","false","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","6"

I turned all the graphics to minimal for my misrable computer and it still looked pretty good. It runs very well and blends high-flying fun in the wilderzone with intense firefights and duels inside the generator room and surrounding corridors.","July 11, 2015","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Shooting is great and requires anticipation and guessing of where the enemy will go. There are plenty of classes to suit what you need.

I liked the original (for me Tribes 2) more as this one is a bit dumbed down classes and customisability wise but it still fast paced and relatively fun shooter. Bcos of the f2p model, though most good things are locked when you start but if you find class you like the essential can be unlocked with few hours of gameplay. I myself got the Steam starter pack offer when it was at discount so got a bit head start that way.","July 23, 2012","true","63.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Imagine somthing a bit like halo, and add skiing and epically cool weapons. I was addicted to this within 30 seconds of working out the controls. It's fun, it feels good and the graphics are amazing.
