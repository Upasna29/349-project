Desert Law will differently appeal to Mad Max fans and fans of post-apocalyptic fiction. There is no base building, resource gathering or micro-management. It is a budget game and it shows, but it is a great little distraction for just $5. The graphics, although out-of-date are still very nicely detailed. They are 2D isometric with 3D vehicles and they also have very nice weather effects. Even without any multiplayer you are still getting a lot of content for just $5 as Desert law has a long campaign of around 30 missions of different varieties.\n\nGameplay is good but the only big major problem I had was that if a story character dies, it is an automatic mission failure. This can be sometimes frustrating because enemies can take out your vehicles and characters pretty quickly if they all target one in your group. So sending out your non-character units to the front of your convey is a must for success, which can be annoying because there is no option to change the types formations of your units like there are in other strategy games. Despite that issue the gameplay is still fun if you are able to overlook those major faults.","April 4, 2015","true","8.2"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","36","42","3","0"

Desert Law is pretty much Blitzkrieg set in a post-apocalyptic world with all those crazy vehicles minus the strategic factor of the previous Blitzkrieg games.\n\nIn every one of these 29 missions you basically control a bunch of armored dune buggies, Hot Rods or armed trucks and let them charge into hordes of wasteland punks. A handful of the stages are stealth missions, where you guide a story character through deserted ruins. All in all quite a good mission and level design if you ask me, especially the desert maps with all the details look pretty nice. Gameplay on the other hand is always relatively straight-forward and not too demanding.\n\nInstead of Blitzkrieg-typical briefings, the missions are interrupted by cheesy comic cutscenes that illustrate the quite shallow story. But still the story lacks sympathetic characters or interesting twists, so don't expect too much. What also differs Desert Law from the other Enigma engine games is the use of hero units. If only one guy from your bunch of "heroes" dies during combat, it immediately leads to failure. This can be quite frustrating, as your heroes bite the dust pretty often in hectic firefights.\n\nThe Good:\n+ Detailed maps\n+ Atmospheric soundtrack\n+ Cool vehicles and units\n+ Pretty good mission design\n+ About 10 to 13 hours of gameplay\n+ Upgradable hero skills\n+ Comic cutscenes\n\nThe Bad:\n- No support for resolutions higher than 1280x1024!\n- Heroes die too fast and lead to failure of mission\n- Not really interesting story or characters\n- No multiplayer\n\nThe Ugly:\n-- Nothing really...\n\nTo put it in a nutshell, I especially recommend this game to fans of the Blitzkrieg/Sudden Strike family. If in addition you like the post-apocalyptic setting too and if you forgive Desert Law's minor problems, you'll have a pretty good time with this game.\n\n7/10","May 26, 2015","true","13.0"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","21","25","2","0"

I like the setyup of the game, it is older but acceptable graphics. Has a lot of content actually. Devs really should come back and add a card set and achievements to make the purchase a bit more "worth it". But if you can catch it on sale it's a nice litle game. I don't like giving a Neg to a "medium" game. So I always opt for the UP vote. Again, it's alright, nothing to eb overly dissapointed with.","September 26, 2015","true","0.2"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","9","16","2","0"

That is compounded by the cars tending to want to approach enemies on their own, resulting in one of them deciding to ram a fence when you tell it to drive down a road. Lastly, moving groups is a pain because they always try and keep the same distances as when they started moving, and there doesn't seem to be a way to tell them to move closer together.\n\nThe nail in the coffin however is that the writing is utterly atrocious.","June 22, 2015","false","0.3"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","8","19","0","0"

No unit clustering, no width detection for paths that are blocked by debris, no 'unjamming' for 'traffic jams'.  Controls are awkward and gameplay is simplistic at best.  Might be worth it if it's under a dollar, but I'd still recommend going and playing some random flash games made by 15 year olds over this.","July 9, 2015","false","0.4"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","28","5","18","0","0"

Take control of Brad a uninteresting desert boy who spends his time shooting guns and hitting on pale women who clearly don't live under the desert sun.\n\nThis RTS game focus on the micro play with a small squad of units and removes any resource gathering macro elements.  This setup has positive synergy with the world of limited resources but due to the weak units, finicky control and absence player feedback orders to the squad seem like suggestions at best.","March 15","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
