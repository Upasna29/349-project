The game was flawless in every aspect: graphically stunning, highly challenging and most importantly, very well designed with great score / gameplay mechanics and sharp player controls.\nThe "World Ignition" version that just came out takes that great game and makes it even better, without changing its core that we, CC veterans loved. It now features more game modes, one extra ship, better graphics in higher resolution, TATE mode, plus many Steam goodies like Cloud, Achievements and Leaderboards. In my opinion, Crimzon Clover World Ignition is THE shmup of the decade and on no occasion should it be missed or ignored by gamers, shmuppers and non-shmuppers alike, that enjoy great video games made with care and attention by their dedicated developers.\nThumbs up, all the way!","June 6, 2014","true","96.2"," 98 of 102 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","98","102","0","0"

This game is one of the very best in the modern shoot them up world. If you like Cave games, then you won't be disapointed. It's a sort of mixture between Ketsui (little timer while you have to score before it reach 0 again) Dodonpachi Daioujou or Saidaioujou (with a Break mode, similar of the Hyper system), 4 differents modes to play in Arcade version (harder), 2 in Novice version (easy).\n\nBoost most is a mixture between super fast bullets like Mushihimesama Futari Original when you reach the highest rank, only the difference is, rank is at maximum already at stage 2 if you played good, didn't bomb or die. Adding super sonic fast suicide bullets on top of that.\n\nOriginal would be a mixture of Mushihimesama Futari Maniac and Dodopachi Daioujou/Saidaioujou. Slower bullets but more busy partterns. In my opinion this is the "easiest" mode of the game.\n\nUnlimited is not for beginner, extremely busy pattern all the time, nothing comparable to this, it's all about cancelling the bullet with your lock before the screen gots too busy. Euphoric, yet very very very hard.\n\nA Time attack mode is also available, only one stage that you have to score as high as possible before the timer reach 0.\n\nTo resume, it's a fantastic game that you can play (sort of) cajually or with very complex strategy to optimise your score. Be warned, this game is really really difficult ;)","November 19, 2014","true","623.7"," 57 of 59 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","57","59","0","0"

WORLD IGNITION, a port of the later arcade release on NESICA coin-ops (again, only in Japan) takes that insanity and cranks it up to twelve - no, twenty.\n\nNow, you don't need me to tell you how to play a top-down shmup, it's like sucking eggs, everyone already knows how it's done. What's different about CC is the Lock-On weapon radar, which locks on to any enemies within its radius and showers them with homing lasers/rockets/sniper bullets of Death (depending on the ship you're using) and the Break System, which amounts to filling a bar at the top of the screen by shooting down enemies. When it's full you can press a button to instantly power up all your ship's weapons for a few seconds, and the display of wanton laser-green devastation is nothing but impressive. But wait - fill the bar again while in Break Mode, and you can press the button again for (wait for it) Double Break Mode, which is like holding a lit match to Magnesium - the brightest lightshow seen in shmup history. It's also good for your score multiplier, too, which helps.\n\nIt's a pity that the original game's Shop mechanic never made it back in - it was one of the most original things about the game, and made it a meaty single-player experience, but this seems to be a faithful port of the arcade release, which obviously didn't have the shop, so I can see why it wasn't included. Ah well, the meat of the game is here, and oh so much more, so rest assured that you're getting your paltry entrance fee's worth and more. Better than Jamestown? Yeah, by miles. Better than Ikaruga, though?...I'll have to get back to you on that.","June 6, 2014","true","3.2"," 58 of 63 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","58","63","0","14"

It's a very niche style of gameplay that tends to play to a very small but dedicated fanbase.  However, Crimson Clover makes for a great game to dip your toes into.  The mechanics are easy to understand, and the difficulty curve is nice enough that it let's you come to grips with the game you are playing before it starts turning the screws on you.  Yet it doesn't feel like an entry level game.\n\nThe graphics, gameplay, presentation. and soundtrack are all great.  Maybe the only thing this game actually lacks is a co-op mode, but that's just a personal preference.  At the price point the game is going for, I'd say pick it up if you are even the least bit curious.","March 10, 2015","true","1.2"," 51 of 54 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","51","54","3","0"

Brilliant of a game as it was, the act of actually playing it presented nothing but headaches for non-Japanese players. As a western PC gamer, playing CC required either changing your Windows region (provided you could get a hold of the physical game), or downloading a pirated version. And after that, the game wasn't 100% controller-friendly. I remember having to use JoyToKey to get the joystick of my Fighting Stick 3 to function. Nothing too horrible, but the UI of the initial release just wasn't polished enough.\n\nNow we have World Ignition, which is nothing short of a blessing due to the simple fact that it makes CC so easy and painless for newcomers to dig into. No need to hunt down the physical disc or feel any of that pirating guilt! Here's a breakdown of the improvements of this port:\n\n-TATE (vertical screen) mode, which was not available in the doujin version. Nice.\n-Training mode now gives access to every stage and boss out of the box, no unlocking required. In the doujin version, you had to unlock each stage (and their respective difficulties) to practice with using the medals you accumulated through each playthrough.\n-A new soundtrack has been added. I prefer the original one, but thankfully you can decide in the menu which one you want to hear.\n-UI presentation is simply much more pleasing to view and navigate.\n-Many, many languages have been added, which is interesting for a game that requires no reading skills whatsoever to properly enjoy. But hey, they're there!\n-Online leaderboards, which the doujin version didn't have for some reason.\n-Surprisingly, there's a name entry screen (which is odd considering that they could've just used your Steam name), but sadly in this version, there's no tanks in the background to shoot with the cursor. :(\n-Gameplay is pretty much the same and unchanged.\n\nThere's quite a few shmups on Steam, some are excellent, while many are meh or just plain garbage. CCWI is one of the excellent ones. Get it.","June 6, 2014","true","1.2"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","39","44","0","2"

It's one of the best games in the genre I've ever played and I can think of no reason it isn't more than worth your money. But simply saying that doesn't make for a very compelling review, especially for the people that for whatever reason aren't already in love with the screen filling insanity of bullet hell games that no doubt take one look at an incomprehensible screenshot and pass it off as just not their thing.\n\nAnd that would be a huge shame, as more than virtually any game in the genre (save Jamestown), Crimzon Clover is remarkably accessible so much that even a scrub like me was able to clear the game (in only several dozen continues). It's still not an easy game, but it offers a point of entry that's often completely forgotten and makes it immensely simple to enjoy regardless of your skill level, and gives a starting point for those new to bullet hell games to build off of before tackling the higher challenges (of which there are many, ready to break you).\n\nThe bread and butter of any bullet hell game though, is the feel of the composed chaos constantly happening on screen, which is something Crimzon Clover understands and executes to near perfection. You're ship moves with a swiftness and maneuverability to allow you to dodge any obstacle, regardless of how overwhelming things can get at times, and this is matched by the sheer power behind every shot which is nothing if not outrageously satisfying. Crimzon Clover also balances nondescript grunt hordes with memorable bosses, sub-bosses, and distinct enemies, leaving little time to get complacent or bored from fighting the same things again and again. It moves at a ridiculous speed and packs so much into every moment that it's almost draining to play for long periods of time. It demands your attention, so much that you almost need to rest between rounds to be able to take it all in.\n\nAnd what a lot there is to take in. In every background shot, enemy design, bullet cascading across the screen, and even the menu designs there is a level of detail and distinction that almost seems unnecessarily robust, as it's hard to appreciate most of it with how quickly everything moves, but goes a very long way into making a stimulating and interesting visual experience that I kept finding new things in every time I revisited a scene.\n\nMaybe I'm sounding a little overzealous, praising something high and low prior to playing I'd virtually no idea of, but Crimzon Clover is such an amazingly fun experience that it really requires no introduction. It's packed with so many modes, made with such a high level of polish, and fine tuned to near perfection that I can't help but sound so absurdly enthusiastic when I talk about it, nor spend anymore time doing so and continue being held up from playing more.\n\nFull disclosure: Crimzon Clover was reviewed using a copy provided by the developer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/solrahlx/recommended/285440/","solrahlx","Rayge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solrahlx/","1604 products in account","My initial review was just basically a fly by -"Oh I played through the game using the infinite continues system. It was good. Let me write four sentences about it to let people know I checked it out." - After playing this game for an extensive amount of time, I feel like I've got to do a re-review on this title.\n\nThis is the first Shoot'em up that made me want to beat my old score. This is the first one to make me want to memorize bullet and enemy patterns. This is the first out of the genre to make me want to 1CC it.\n\nCrimzon Clover is one of the best Shmups I've had the pleasure of playing in the last 24 years or so of me enjoying the genre. The game comes with necessities I feel that every Shmup should have this day in age. You've got training, local leader boards, online leader boards, multiple game modes, and play back. Along with viewing options for those who want to play in the TATE view.\n\nThe game's design is just amalgam of awesomeness. The art direction is fantastic and, in my opinion, blows anything since its inception out of the water. The ships and enemies look detailed and aren't static, characterless bullet sponges just floating across the screen. The bullet and enemy patterns are fun and actually interesting and aren't "impossible" for those who want to put in a reasonable amount of time at 1CCing this. The game does a fantastic job of making the player feel empowered with the use of BREAK and DOUBLE BREAK. Pair that with an addictive scoring system, and you get a damn fine shooter that I feel is the best Bullet Hell out of any platform.\n\nThe game is so good that I actually felt guilty afterwards only paying $9.99. If you see this game on sale you need to snatch it up if you'r even REMOTELY interested in this genre. You can really feel the passion that was put into this game from the single man developer, Yotsubane. Also, there's some DLC planned in the not too distant future that brings an arcade flyer (for those more serious about the genre than me), Superplay Demos, and NEW music by Gryzor87.\n\nI really wish this game got more recognition for how awesome it is. This is definitely a hidden gem that needs to be brought to light for the masses.","February 12, 2015","true","21.2"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","27","28","2","0"

Now, the even further polished and refined arcade version arrives on Steam, and it's absolutely essential for anyone with even a fleeting interest in the shoot em up genre.\n\nCC's bullet hell action has you dodging and shooting manically through a series of 5 stages and a host of boss fights. Aiding you are a lock on laser, that allows you to target enemies around you and awards a score bonus for destroying multiple enemies simultaneously, and "Break Mode", a super powered state which is recharged the more aggressively you play, and allows you to double your speed, fire power, and points gained when active, and then quadruple them if you can fill up the break meter a second time before it ends.\n\nCC is an absolute blast to play. The stages are creative, varied, and intense. Some of them are quite long, but never overstay their welcome and always stay interesting throughout. The bosses feel fresh and exciting with cool gimmicks and fundamentally fun patterns.  And targeting and breaking feels incredibly unique from any other game in the genre. One minute you're passively biding your time to get the maximum lock on while dodging bullets, the next you're turning the dodging action of the game on its head as you rocket around at break neck speed unleashing your own bullet hell upon enemies. Every moment of the game feels unique and compelling.\n\nIt's also very content heavy. It's got 4 modes and 4 ships with their own unique play styles.  The game is very challenging as well, on the arcade difficulty (there are novice modes, for less confident players) it may take some more time than a full length rpg to 1 credit clear it, and the scoring systems provide immense depth and competition with other players that could take years to master. CC is absolutely worth every penny and more.\n\nThis game is easily tied with Skullgirls and Rogue Legacy as my favorite game on Steam. I cannot recommend it enough!","June 9, 2014","true","55.3"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","27","29","0","2"

This isn't really as big of a deal as it sounds; you'll be able to tell if the framerate is wrong right away, and restarting your computer makes everything work just dandy. This may have been fixed in the latest patch, but I don't know for sure.\n\nOther thoughts\nThis game embodies everything that makes shoot-em-up games so great. I've seen it called "the Cave Story of shmups", and that's honestly the perfect way to describe this game; both Cave Story and Crimzon Clover completely define their respective genres.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/recommended/285440/","PeteOzzy","PeteOzzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/","4903 products in account","I hadn't intended on reviewing Yotsubane's very first release, Crimzon Clover. My experience with shmups has been hindered by living in a PAL territory and lacking the means to hit the import scene hard enough to be worthwhile. I'm an absolute genre fanatic and I've always snatched up the few titles available but I'll always be envious of the lists reeled off by true diehards containing titles I can't even pronounce let alone experience for myself. Worried that my opinion might lack merit, I decided to play CCWI recreationally instead.\n\nHowever, something unexpected occured that made me reconsider; Crimzon Clover ended up being one of my favourite shmups in a very, very long time.\n\nDon't get me wrong when I say I've not played as many titles as the wisest of genre gurus, it doesn't mean I've little experience to draw from. Since my very first contact with Gates of Zendocon on the Atari Lynx, the scrolling shooter has resonated with me. I've played through some of the most revered names; Ikaruga, Radiant Silvergun, R-Type, Gradius, DoDonPachi, Mushihimesama, and Espgaluda to name a few. When lucky enough, I've even devoured lesser known titles like Guwange, Trouble Witches, Akai Katana and Blood Money. I might have been hindered by my home country's region standard but I'd like to think I know my Twinbees from my Winbees despite that.\n\nCrimzon Clover World Ignition, as you may have gathered, is a vertical-scrolling bullet hell shmup. It fits comfortably into all the traditions you've come to expect, with your main task being to down an inordinate number of foes while dodging an over-whelming flurry of pink and blue projectiles. If you know the genre tropes and conventions, then chances are you won't find many surprises but for once, I mean this in the most positive sense. What Crimzon Clover does that you've seen done a dozen times over, it does it well enough to make seem fresh. The areas in which it falters are concerns you can address to the genre as a whole. Yotsubane doesn't try to revolutionise things, but simply embody the best of what you expect and it largely accomplishes that goal.\n\nI was genuinely surprised to learn that Crimzon Clover isn't even five years old; it's so convincingly arcadey that I immediately placed it in my mind as one of the cabinet classics. The movement is tight and as pixel perfect as it utterly needs to be. Even on keyboard controls which aren't my preferred choice, I found myself able to maneuver more expertly than I do on many others. The Break Meter is a fantastic and unique mechanic that inspires a really intense action as well. A bar fills as you tally kills that can be drained incrementally for bombs or filled entirely to trigger a Break state where your shots become screen-encompassing salvos of death. It's a welcome break from the traditional pick-up method for bombs and keeps your eye flitting across the screen, watching intently for the right moment.\n\nThere's a nice selection of modes and crafts that offer various ways to modify the game. Unlike some shmups, I found that the extra ship types actually provided enough of a contrast to enjoy the multiple playthroughs as their own experiences. The same is true of the modes, with Boost being a personal highlight. It's great to play a shmup where the reason to keep coming back isn't simply to try and finally "one credit clear" it.\n\nThe pixelated style of the sprites is attractive, with the models being surprisingly detailed. I would occasionally lose my ship to the commotion but that could be down to my colour-blindness and I obviously can't fault a game for my own defect. The music is a typical pumping techno that really suits the mood and while the sound effects lack a little creativity, it's hard to deny that the endless explosions aren't weirdly satisfying. For me, at least, the sound design rarely needs to be much more than adequate and, like the plot, blurs into the background once I'm fully immersed in the action. If you find yourself worrying about your characters motivations in the middle of a boss fight then the developer has done something very wrong!\n\nOverall, I've actually found it a little difficult to write this review. It would be so quick and clean-cut to say nothing more than if you love the genre then this is an absolute must-buy but that would do a disservice to the hard work and love invested. Possibly the most convincing statement I can make in its favour, and something I think only a genre lover will truly relate to, is that I spent ten minutes upon finishing my first playthrough reclined in my chair, exhausted from the ordeal. My hands were cramped into a hook-like shape and my throat hoarse from cheering and *ahem* making my own sound effects. Crimzon Clover is everything I adore about the genre and with this style of game, that's as good as calling it perfect.","April 25, 2015","true","5.2"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","4"

Few non-Japanese gamers were destined to ever try it...until now, that is, since that version has beaten the odds and made it Westward as "World Ignition."\n\nIn case you needed to hear it, your goal here is to blow up lots of stuff, collect lots of shiny stars, and not die: you've got a handful of aircraft to choose from, each of which is armed with both a standard shot (which is always at "full" power, so dying won't hamstring you) and an unlimited-use "lock-on" weapon, which covers a large chunk of the screen and can zap lots of enemies at once, but deploying it slows your movement, so take care not to unleash it if you need to boogie. As you wreak havoc you'll fill up an energy meter, visible in the upper right: once it's got a bit of juice you gain access to a smart bomb, which will damage everything onscreen and give you a moment of invincibility to catch your breath: you can only stock one at a time, but refilling the meter enough for another one doesn't take too long, so definitely use it when you need it.\n\nIf you let the meter continue to fill all the way up, however, hitting the bomb button will instead activate "break mode," which is where things get interesting: while this state lasts, your firepower is boosted, and so are the points gained from blasting baddies (and if you can get the meter all the way up again before the "break" runs out, you can enter a "double break," which juices things up even more). While surviving is just a matter of moving, shooting and bombing at the right  times, racking up high scores involves constantly juggling your shot, lock-on, and energy meter to get the most points possible out of every target - enemies send loads of attacks your way, but only the small, shining "hit area" at the very center of your ship can take damage, so if you can weave that tiny bit of yourself through the dangerous bits you'll make it out the other side in one piece.\n\nWhile the basic idea of the game never changes, there are several modes here that put a different spin on things: aside from the standard "Normal" mode, there's "Boost" mode ("breaks" are activated automatically and don't run out until you bomb or lose a life, but enemies get tougher the longer you can keep it going), "Unliimited" mode (an extra-tough challenge for veteran shmuppers), and "Time Attack" mode (a fixed course where you have infinite lives but only three minutes to rack up as many points as you can). Normal and Boost also have "Novice" variations, which are easier than the standard ones and well-suited for those looking to get their feet wet and build some confidence before moving up; you can also practice individual stages to shore up spots that are giving you trouble.\n\nThough certain sections of the game will smack you down hard and suddenly enough to make you wince, don't let that dissuade you from giving it a shot: if you can manage to get through the front door without feeling intimidated by the screenshots full of unfriendly fire, you'll find one of the most polished PC shooters in existence waiting for you: moreover, it's a bit of a miracle that the gaming gods have even seen fit to bring such a little-known gem to our shores in any form, at a steal of a price to boot, and they deserve recognition for making it happen. If you still hold any love, or even curiosity, for the simple, deep, hard-edged and irrepressibly pure arcade titles of old, by all means look this one up: releases of its caliber are all too rare these days.","June 6, 2014","true","5.3"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

I can't beat games on hard difficulties, or on only one continue, and I don't have a vertically oriented monitor/television to play them on.  But there's something incredible about playing a great shmup, when everything comes together - great music, varied enemies and bullet patterns, and game mechanics/controls that just make you feel powerful and make everything fun.  This is what Crimson Clover is to me: a fun, extremely difficult bullet-hell shmup, but one that can still be enjoyed by the casual fan.  I probably had to use an average of 10+ continues each time I've played through the game so far, but it was still a fun and interesting experience.  The three ships have different bullet patterns and stats (Type III moved around the screen quickly but has a narrow bullet spread), and it took me a few plays to even realize that you could press a button that not only narrows your bullet spread to help concentrate on a larger enemy/boss, but also locks onto a bunch of enemies and fires off some lock-on missiles (reminds me a bit of Panzer Dragoon, or maybe Raystorm?  I think it's a fairly common feature in a lot of shmups - and speaking of powerful, Type II's lockon attack is badass) - I guess I would have known it earlier had I actually watched the tutorial but I really was able to just jump into the game without having done so and it was still fun as hell.  Bombs erase all bullets on screen at the time and destroying certain enemies also removes their bullets from the screen, and you can (and must, in many cases) use these features in order to survive.  The first I activated Double Break, wow, talk about a bulletstream.  There is an arcade mode with an Unlimited Mode available, and should be perfect for veterans of the series who might find novice mode too easy (novice mode still has a ton of bullets on screen at once, but even after 3-4 playthroughs, and as someone who isn't all too good at the genre in general, I was starting to excel at dodging/memorizing certain patterns or using my bombs/destroying enemies to remove bullets).  Most of the shmups I've played are on the Dreamcast or Xbox 360 (or Jamestown or other indie ones on PC) and I have to say that this one ranks up there with one of the most fun I've played (I'd have to put it up there with Jamestown and Deathsmiles).  The framerate fluctuated between just under and just over 60 FPS no matter how much was going on on-screen (and with the amount of explosions, stars and bullet sprites that can be on screen at once, especially with double break activated, that's nice).  The only real complaints I have are that it took me a little while to figure out how to get my controls working (I wanted to use a 360 controller and start is not mapped to start [it's mapped to Y, which is actually helpful if you need to pause in the heat of the moment, but the game doesn't have button prompts for the 360 controller, hence "partial controller support", but it works fine out of the box], so I had to press random buttons on the keyboard until it activated the menu, and it turned out I had pressed one of the second player keyboard buttons, so when I first started the game I had to select two ships and then just let the second player ship get blown up).  It also took a few tries for the game to properly keep track of my video settings, and you need to tweak the stretch settings to get the game to fill the screen on 1920x1080 resolution.  A patch to include native 360 controller support and to make the resolution settings a bit less cryptic would be cool, but are not really all that necessary since you'll probably get the hang of it quickly.  Whether you're a casual fan of shmups or a hardcore bullet-hell player, I can't recommend the game enough.  It is also forgiving enough with the continues that it could serve as a great introduction to the genre, mainly because it embodies much of what I like about any shmup (cool looking sprites, great music, varied ship types and the explosions, bullet sprites and the way the ships control and destroy everything in sight just makes you feel powerful).","November 29, 2014","true","2.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

Its hard to beat the feeling of satisfaction when you enter Break/Double Break Mode and just fill the screen with lasers, explosions, and stars.  You can also lock onto a bunch of enemies at once in your normal mode and fire away.  There's like not a moment in this game where blowing up a bunch of stuff isn't an option.\n\nThere's 3-4 different ships to pick from and they all play differently.  Another good thing, at least for me, is the game has an unlimited continue mode that lets you just play and explode stuff at your leisure, without worrying about getting a game over or necessitating the type of memorization needed to progress very far in most SHMUP's.  I'm not very good at these types of games and this type of mode lets me have fun without putting a heavy investment into the game.\n\nIn short, CCWI is a fun, explosion-filled game that even those with casual interest in SHMUP's can enjoy.","October 3, 2014","true","2.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

Hell, you've probably already bought it. This is a Steam port of the Arcade version of the 2010 Comiket shmup, with all the bells and whistles that you'd expect: TATE mode, more ships, better graphics (in higher resolutions!), better controller support, and all the modes and stages unlocked right off the bat. This is probably one of the best shmups you'll find here on steam, bar none.\n\nFor the non-shmup fan / the shmup curious: This game is like taking Giga Wing and giving it a shot full of Michael Bay's explosion wet dreams. Not only are you going to be dodging bullets left and right, but with the break and double break modes (modes that boost your score, speed, and strength exponentially for a few moments by filling a gauge on the top of the screen) you will be seeing nothing but lasers and stars, but not so much that you can't see the enemy bullets that are coming at you over said lasers and stars.

Ltd. games. DoDonPachi seems to be the largest influence, from the enemy designs to your ship and its abilities.\n\nThose are big boots to fill, certainly, and I'm happy to say that Crimzon Clover achieves it. For the particularly masochistic, its difficult modes offer screens filled with projectiles that you'd be hard-pressed to avoid, and, as with all shooters of this ilk, getting in 'the zone' and figuring things out elicits a warm, zen-like feeling that I don't seem to get with other genres of games.\n\nThe only thing I find problematic is the fact that I don't have a good arcade stick. The Xbox 360 controller, while usable, doesn't offer me much in the way of precision. As a result, I constantly found myself scrolling a little further than I wanted to and, inevitably, into a wayward blue or purple dot that ended my run prematurely. I don't know that this is particularly a fault with the game because the game itself is designed very well. I just feel as though there's nothing in the way of accomodation for users of joypads.\n\nI do heartily recommend this game if you're a fan of the genre.

On the other hand, fans of bullet hells have little excuse to pass on this gem.\n\nCrimzon Clover doesn't have extremely elaborate attack patterns like you would see in a Touhou game, but what it does have is bullets, lots of bullets, so many bullets that if you tallied up all the bullets in Mars Matrix, Jamestown, and Ikaruga combined Crimzon Clover might very well still have them beat - and that's on the standard difficulty. The enemies aren't the only ones with lots of firepower though as players can fairly easily fill up part a gauge to use bombs (though the amount the gauge needs to be filled increases with each bomb usage), wait until the gauge is full to enter the destructive and score-multiplying 'break mode' or fill up two gauges to enter the absurdly powerful 'double break mode'.\n\nCrimzon Clover also provides a good chunk of variety for players. There are two difficulties (and possibly even a third, hidden difficulty of some sort) as well as four distinctive modes of play, three different ships, local and online leaderboards, and the option for local co-op. Crimzon Clover also graciously provides the option of unlimited continues for less-skilled fans of the genre (I lost track around the 30 continue mark on my playthrough) and comes with a customary 'true' endboss for anyone capable of performing a 1 Credit Clear. In terms of stages, Crimzon Clover is a bit on the low side at 5, but these are five fairly lengthy stages, non-boss enemies very much pose a threat and do not simply exist for the sake of points, and many stages even have a full-on midboss.\n\nLastly, Crimzon Clover is simply beautiful to look at. There is an astonishing sense of speed to the game as panoramas rush past the player and nearly every enemy has multiple moving parts and intricate animations. Add to this a fast-paced soundtrack and plenty of explosions and Crimzon Clover is nearly worth buying for the aesthetics alone, to say nothing of the fact that it is almost certainly one of the best bullet hells out there and possibly even a strong contender for outright being *the* best in the genre.","June 12, 2014","true","2.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Whoever composed the music in the game deserves a hundred medals! It fits the mood of the game near perfectly and always helps to listen to when you are feeling down.\nThe only thing i'm dissapointed in with this game is the lack of levels, Having only 5 Levels does restrict replayability value somewhat.\n\nThe difficulty suits both Beginners and Seasoned Veterans of Bullet Games, The Novice mode is great for beginners and returning players looking to sharpen up and unlimited mode is perfect for Veterans with an extremely high difficulty factor.\n\nMy closing thoughts on the game are these:\nCC:WI Is a brilliantly though of game with easy and challenging elements with a rocking soundtrack to boot.\nWhile some game Settings are limited everything you need is there with the option to flip your screen sideways, Change keybinds, Switch between using a Controller or Keyboard and the usual Sound Options.\nI would most definetely recommend this game to anyone looking to get into the Bullet Hell Genre and also recommend it to Bullet Hell Experts because this game will test even the greatest.\n\n--Ratings--\nGame Design - 9.7/10\nGame Soundtrack - 10/10\nGame Options/Settings - 6/10\nReplayability Value - 4/10\nDifficulty - 4/10 -:- 10/10\nOVERALL - 9.2/10\n\n--Media Section--\nCC:WI Trailer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyWFF1sNfKM\nNovice Mode Difficulty (Level/Stage 4) - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=573320897\n","December 11, 2015","true","6.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It also has decent variety with 4 different game modes (Original, Boost, Unlimited and Time Attack) and 4 different player ships.\nThe Novice difficulty is good for Beginners and isn't TOO easy, and on the other end of the spectrum you have Unlimited mode, which is pure bullet-cancelling INSANITY.

I really liked this aspect as it rewards you for not relying on bombs heavily.\n- Tons of unique enemy designs.  It never felt repetitive.\n\nCons\n- None.\n\nThough there were a couple very small things that went outside my own personal preference...\n\n- The movement should be just a little bit slower for the amount of bullets on the screen.  However it seems this is a bit of a trade off depending on the ship you choose.  Not exactly a con -but i wish there was a bit more control over that as I like very slow precise movement in these types of games.\n\n- Later in the game some of larger bullets that spread fully across the field that require you to touch them without hitting their hitbox against your own were layered over the depth of ship making it very difficult to judge youhr position when weaving between them.  This didn't happen often and could just as easily be considered a part of the challenge.\n\nThat said, I can't praise this game enough.  It felt like a work of genuine passion for bullet hell games.\n\nI'm glad I didn't wait for this one to go cheap on sale -the creator deserves to make a lot of money for this game and I hope he releases more games like this on steam!","November 25, 2014","true","1.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Add on steamworks support, allowing for the first time Online Leaderboards, achivements, and of course steam cards/badges, and it's hard to call this anything but a fully fludged product.

It's one of those bullethells that goes out of its way to be over the top and flashy. It follows standard bullethell ideas, three ships, a stage where you go forward, shoot things, your overpowered, and everything explodes. What it does differently is that EVERYTHING IS BIG AND LOUD AND IN YOUR FACE! You can fire, shoot homing rockets, and do something called Boost Mode where you get even more overpowered and the screen becomes a deathtrap to increase your points. In the first stage alone there are almost 700 things to make boomies out of, and it has your fair share of difficulties. Well... 4 of them. You got Boost Mode which means infinite Boost Mode (Very Easy mode), Standard (Easy), Unlimited (♥♥♥♥ on a ♥♥♥♥ Extremely Hard), and Time (egh?).\n\nPros - Over the top madness mixed with standard bullethell ideas makes for a tasty treat of death and destruction. Very well made means good FPS, score is very large treating you with a nice 10 Billion points for no lifes lost so scores are more diverse, good fun all around.\n\nCons - Since everything is dying horribly it's hard to see your ship very well. Most of the time you caught up in killing everything that you commit suicide out of pure fun and it gets really annoying mixed with the very very tight controls. Recommend using something that will help movement, it's very wild and fast and sometimes unpredictable. Lack of settings mean smaller screens will be shot down, lack of settings to control to mass destruction of death from keeping you from suiciding, and last but not least only 4 modes and it wouldn't be so bad if the difficulty wasn't so wonky.\n\nIt has a lot of downfalls but the pros keep it standing firmly.

However, i’ve found Crimson Clover to be fairly accessible to someone who hasn’t played bullet hells or is even a pro with other, more basic shoot 'em ups. There is no story, but seeing as it is a score chaser, it isn’t expected, if you want a story, you’d be best off with a game like Astebreed. There are four ships but their differences are unfortunately, pretty minor. One has a basic spread attack, the other one is focused. Every ship has a lock on attack (allowing for a very impressive fight with a mini-boss on the final stage), but these only differ in visual appearances. The levels and enemies/bosses are surprisingly detailed, but you most likely won’t notice without dying (this game demands focus), and all the bosses are multistage (including miniboses). The music, although fairly simple, is great and very fitting to the type of action that happens during the game.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 8/10\n\n*edit: I've finally unlocked the fourth ship.","June 25, 2015","true","1.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

I was little skeptical first, but i'm glad that my curiosity took best of me. By first glance you might think this is again one of those Japanese games with crazy difficulty, but don't let that fool you. It's hard, but still fair. Don't concentrate what you are shooting, in this game you are always hitting something by holding the fire button, but actually concentrate dodging enemies bullets. The game has been designed extremly well and it is actually fun and I mean super fun to play. It feels like you are in control of everything which is happening around you and if you get destroyed, it's your own fault. I'm not even big fan of huge explosions, but in this game it's how you register succesfully destroyed enemy and it just feels so DAMN good. Dodge n' destroy, baby.\n\nCouple major reasons which made me really curious about this game, was because the game was made by one person, if you don't count composer and it became so famous at Japan, that they even made own version to arcades.\n\nMost people who speak ill of these indie games with retro stylish graphics, don't understand the real reason why they're suddenly so popular among indie developers, just because they're so obsessed by the graphics. It's not because these games try to remember past, it's because they never forgot it and they concentrate being fun to play. Shmup veteran or not, I can recommend this game easily for anyone, it's pure awesome!","September 22, 2014","true","11.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The level of production here is way beyond what you see even in full-price commercial shmups!  It's also clearly a labor of love on the part of a developer who really enjoys and "gets" shmups at a deep level.  Excellent risk-reward mechanics, satisfying shot types and good ship design, fun and easy-to-learn scoring, well-put-together stages and bosses, plenty of different modes and difficulties, even an OP unlockable ship.\n\nMy chief complaints with the game are difficulty, and the music.  Novice difficulty at times feels too easy, while Arcade is too hard.  I'm no pro, but I've 1cc'ed my share of shmups, and I can't even begin to touch Unlimited mode.  I guess that means it's got longevity, haha.  As for the music, maybe Danmaku Unlimited 2's OST spoiled me, but I don't care for Crimzon Clover's background music that much.  It's pretty much instantly forgettable generic shmup music.  However, the sound design apart from the BGM is incredibly well done.

It is very up front and honest about its influences but manages to take the tropes of a given genre and make it into something fresh and new, which may be the wankiest thing ever said about this game.\n\nLong story short, it's an excellent shooter. Various elements recall the best games from Cave, Raizing, and even Triangle Service without feeling derivative of any of them. Except Cave. The DoDonPachi vibe is strong with this one but the play system is different enough that it's more like a knowing nod to one of the greats than a pure ripoff.\n\nGraphically the game is a bit hit and miss. Some sprites and backgrounds seem a tad too scaled up and as a result are more pixelated than you'd expect. The background variety is quite good though. Weapon and bullet graphics are excellent. Colorful enough that you never feel cheated, unlike every single game ever made by Raizing/8ing.\n\nIf you like shooters, you need this game. There's nothing here that's groundbreaking but not everything needs to be. This is a game made by a competent developer with an obvious love for the genre in general, and I can not wait to see what Yotsubane will come up with next.","September 8, 2015","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In Crimson Clover, merely clearing the screen of bullets is never done without a tinge of regret. You can do better, and Crimzon Clover knows you can do better. Crimzon Clover and I just want to see you be the man or woman or genderqueer you were meant to be. Don't bomb. Ride that edge until your break meter is maxed, and then ride the edge AGAIN until your DOUBLE BREAK meter is maxed, and then RELEASE YOUR MOST PRIMAL SCREAM FROM YOUR HEART OF HEARTS AS YOU UNLEASH THE FURY. Savor this moment. Look at all those star medals. They are yours and yours alone.\n\nCrimzon Clover is easily one of the best shmups on steam, and very well could be one of the best shmups ever. Whether you've been in love with the genre for years or didn't realize they still made these since Galaga, you'll do well to add this game to your collection.","July 13, 2014","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As a result, they end up unnecessarily difficult, tend to have scoring systems that are hard to digest and even harder to optimize. Enter Yotsubane.\n\nThis game features a relatively simple scoring system that provides an extremely satisfactory risk / reward system, encouraging skilled players to engage in extremely risky behavior, and rewarding you with higher positions on the leaderboards as a result. Yotsubane has a very good understanding of what makes SHMUPS fun to play, and the living proof is in this game. My *only* gripe about this game was the poor music, it did the job and felt shmuppy, but it was mostly droning, unmemorable trash that i'd never listen to on its own With the recently released arranged soundtrack that can be used in-game as a total replacement, this has now been fixed.\n\nI wouldn't even say that this is "the best shmup on the platform" or "an acceptable alternative to CAVE shooters", this game stands on its own and I would consider it to be better than most of what's out there, regardless of platform or origin.","May 26, 2015","true","16.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Good. Crimzon Clover is perfectly tuned and intensely rewarding. The novice difficulty is immediately accessible and the scoring system favors a style of play that keeps you holding on just a bit longer to deploy break mode, then double breaking at the perfect moment, causing the sky to erupt in awesome. Arcade mode is arcade hard, but not cheap. Your hitbox is a glowing jewel a few pixels wide, and the screen will fill with bullets, but nothing is unavoidable. Still, good luck with that 1cc.

(also the translation isn't a butchered mess!) CC favors a more Frantic "bullets-all-over" style over the methodical "bullet curtain" some Danmaku/Bullet Hells go for. While this may seem overwhelming to newbies, the interesting Break meter feature over set bomb items makes it a bit more managable all while rewarding more advanced players. The particles can get very close to "what is even going on?!?" levels, but it's notr the worst I've encountered and the carnage adds to the fun IMO. If this game's too easy for you, you can try the Unlimted mode, which adapts to how well you're doing or try the Arcade dificulty. If that's still to easy for you you are lying and should seriously stop it, no one's going to make fun of you if you admit it.\n\nIf you're a fan of Old School top down shoot 'em ups or are a filthy NEET Danmaku lover like me, this game is an absolute must.\n(PS buy the soundtrack, it's fantastic, seriously)","October 21, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Conjured up many fond memories of Dodonpachi. I love the mechanic that powers up your weapons by blasting the crap out of stuff, rather than the standard "chase the powerups" that we've come to expect over the years, which lets you focus on what this game is really all about (the aforementioned blasting the crap out of stuff). And when you do power things up all the way and hit that Double Break, you just can't help but feel like a badass (even if you suck at bullethell, like I do). Boss fights are hectic and keep you on your toes, and some excellent pixel art and an enjoyable soundtrack round out the whole package.","June 7, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is quite a bit of room for individual game play improvement with the multiple modes catering to one's skill levels. The Crimzon Clover Dev team continually listens to feedback from the players and bring quick updates to hone the game to perfection. With the new resolution feature in the latest update, I will now be able to play this on my "Tated" (vertical monitor orientation) Candy Cab arcade machine.  Indeed, as other reviewers have mentioned, this indie game was given a true arcade release in Japan via the Taito NESiCA LIVE arcade System.\n\nI stated "Crimzon Clover Dev team" but this true indie STG  is created by one individual from Japan whose background is that of a literal arcade Shoot em up scoring world champion who initially made this for the Doujin (PC home brew) scene. It was obviously good enough for Taito to bring it on board with revamped graphics and game play tweaked for the arcade.\n\nThis is a master product.\n\nThe price point for this arcade quality STG gem is a jaw dropping value for the level of content within.\n\nPlaying through the game , I get the feeling that it's a homage to certain prior shoot em up titles regarding stage set design.  I am loosely reminded of Dragon Blaze in the third level with the giant red flowers. CAVE influence with other subtle nods to other shoot em up titles/companies weaved throughout the game levels  adds to the richness without becoming a clone.\n\nA sort of labor of love encompassing aspects of the STG or Shoot em up Canon.\n\n\nSurely, this may seem like a gush review but it's excellent. Add the narration of it's humble upbringings crafted by a master player which hits a Cinderella status with arcade and now world wide Steam release and the certificate of excellence is etched in gold by it's very history and path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","July 8, 2014","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's hard to tell it's a doujin game as opposed to a commercial one The general gameplay may remind you of a mix of things (Dondonpachi, Raystorm), but the main thing that makes this stand out? The break mode system, which not only allows the bulk of the scoring but also provinging a boost to your firepower. Double Break mode is something that has to be seen to understand what a boost to score and firepower that is.\n\nThis is a port of the Arcade version which was previously japanese only, and with it come some changes, mainly the limiter shop being removed but in return you get 3 ships to start (and one to unlock, though easier than the original), all levels accessible in training and free play in most modes (gotta 1cc if you want to see the True Final boss). The general changes are double edged, making the game easier in some ways and harder compared to the original game (stage 3 in particular). But for less confident players, there's Novice versions of both original and boost mode (I'll get on to this later)\n\nThere's three modes to the game:\n\nOriginal: The game's normal mode, where you can see the full scoring system in effect.\n\nUnlimited: This is basically to CC what Ultra is to Cave games and Lunatic is to Touhou games: The game unleashing bullet hell to its fullest extent.\n\nSimple (original game only): A toned down game in both difficulty and mechanics which used your break/bomb bar to determine rank/points/attack power.\n\nBoost (World Ignition only): It's Simple Mode's rank dynamics taken up to 11 as when your Break/Bomb bar fills, you will enter break mode that goes on until you lose a life or you bomb and the longer you're in it, the more the game's difficulty ramps up during it.\n\nTime attack: in the spirit of the old Hudson star soldier caravan games, this has you with a limited time (and unlimited lives) to score as much as possible.\n\nAnd each mode has a small tutorial bit before you start that explains things pretty well.\n\nThe sound track is very good with separate stage musics for normal and unlimited (by default but you can change them around in the options) with its bosses each getting their own theme. Not sure if it'd justify spending extra for the soundtrack, though it slightly makes up for the removal of the sound test that was in the original.\n\nAnd the plot? There is none beyond "Blow them up"\n\nUpdate:resolution/screen issues fixed.\n\nHighly recommended for any shump fan.","June 12, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Alright, where do I even get started.\nThis game has only one question to ask you- EXPLOSIONS? And said explosions are usually from the hordes of enemies that you cut down. This game has possibly the best ratio of awesome per minute of any game i've ever played, considering it takes about a half hour to beat. But beating the game with the unlimited continues you are given isn't the real point of the game. You are supposed to beat it with one credit to get the maximum score, and even if you don't care about score, you have to do that to unlock the secret boss. I dare anyone to play through this game once and not want to do it again.\nThe rundown:\nStory: "lol" Nezter, 2014. But seriously though, the only story this game has is your epic quest to beat the game without continuing. Which will probably take the casual player a while.\nGameplay: It's like an arcade shooter that time forgot, with gameplay concepts seamlessly integrated from the genre's bests. You hold down the shoot button, time your lock-on attack, weave through curtains of bullets, and **** your pants when you decide to try Unlimited Mode and realize THAT YOU AREN'T MAN ENOUGH YET. And YET is the key to this game's enjoyability. Action movies are one of the greatest media because they depict one or two people standing against impossible odds and winning in spectacular cinematic fashion. Most games have been inspired by this concept, and face a choice- either make the game so easy that anyone can look cool and win, or to make the game really hard and tell it's players to GET GUD. Crimson Clover strikes a balance between the two. Novice Original is a great starting point for newcomers to the genre, unlimited continues make it so that death is never very frustrating, and the BREAK MODE and DOUBLE BREAK MODE and the screen clearing bombs and the slow movement mode when locking on make dying feel like your fault. The game mixes pre-set bullet patterns with attacks launched from moving mooks, and as long as you know what's going to happen next, you can dodge it. Even if Unlimited mode makes it seem impossible.\nSound: Music is sick beats that have a slightly retro tone, fitting in with the late 90's asthetic the game has. Sound effects are good, especially the explosion noises and the sound of BREAK MODE activating. It really lets you know you're about to lay a beatdown on the poor sap you're fighting.\nGraphics: Sprites and backgrounds look great, at least what I could see of them looked great, because of all the stars and explosions everywhere. Said explosions look great, and DOUBLE BREAK MODE lets you give the bullet hell back to the enemies in a gloriously beautiful fashion.\nPrice: Ten bucks. I got it on sale because I'm cheap, but it's easily worth the original price. It'd be worth twice as much.\nReplayability: Two difficulty levels, Four unique game modes. As long as you want to 1cc the game, you should get more than your money's worth out of this game.\nFinal opinion: If you don't like shooters, this game has the best chance of converting you. If you like shooters, than this game should already be in your collection. If you don't like videogames, then maybe this one will change your mind.\n\nNo matter how much you suck, this game will push you beyond your limits. There'll be that moment where you do something you didn't think that you were going to be able to do. And those moments happen every time you play Crimson Clover. "Shooting Game never Die." And those moments are why.","December 14, 2014","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mastering in what parts to use this and when simply dodging bullets is the basis of this game. But it goes even further mechanically as it allows you to fill the bar faster by getting a higher multiplier with the lock-on laser and also has a slower filling secondary break bar which fills your break bar when you enter break mode which allow you to enter break mode while being in break mode into a double break mode that is one of the most insane things I ever saw in a shmup... But however leaves your break bar completely dry.\n\nThose mechanics completely change how the game feels, while is still a bullet hell, it also remembers shmups of memorization and optimization like r-type or ikaruga as you have to menage your break bar and know where to use it.\n\nNow add the fact that it looks great, has a awesome soundtrack, a good novice mode, great bosses way above your usual bullet hell boss(well maybe not the first one) and a scoring system that is actually sane. Then you end with one of the best smups ever done and definitely the best shmup on steam.\n\nIf you like bullets hells then you need to have this, if you like shmups but was never keen on bullet hells you might find one you enjoy here and if you ever had a passing interest in shmups but never knew where to start this is it.","April 1, 2015","true","56.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Specifically this is a "danmaku" or bullet hell shooting game which means most the the time the entire screen is covered in pink bullets, enemies, multipliers, and powerups. It not exactly a relxing experience, and the game leaves the player almost no room for error after the first couple stages. However, Novice Mode allows non experts to make it further into the game and Training Mode allows you to practice against that one boss who always kills you, so dont fear the reaper. Buy this game if 2D shooters appeal to you at all, and while practice is the only way to improve your play, the game is fun even in casual bursts. Its essentially an arcade game, but to enjoy it properly, treat it like a roguelike and resist that temptation to hit "CONTINUE"","August 24, 2014","true","12.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I actually read a few reviews before purchasing this game for myself and saw quite a few saying that Crimzon Clover is similar to the DoDonpachi games from Cave, and while I have never played Dodonpachi I have played some of the Cave shmups and have always found them quite fun and I honestly believe the people that compare this game with Cave developed games were spot on. It's a really fast-paced and visually stunning game with really awesome music which are really three things that every good shmup need at the very least, I also appreciate the fact that the controls themselves are very responsive and things such as enemy bullets standing out amongst all the crazy action (a feature I also noticed in Danmaku Unlimited 2, which I also recommend) make the game very fun to play rather than being just a generic shmup that often end up more difficult just because they're not very well defined.\n\nAlso, I want to point out above all else that the Boost Mode is pretty amazing and makes this game at least twice as fun as it started at. I'm sure other games have similar mechanics, but it's the first time (at least in recent memory) I've seen a mode as interesting as Boost. Not only does it make the game 100% more explosive and hectic, it also gives you an additional challenge in trying to make sure you don't lose your Boost and go back to (temporarily) being a peashooter. Also, with the addition of the Type-Z (which requires progessive unlocking, which I honestly haven't completed yet but am working on), the game actually has additional replayability, which is a nice plus for a shmup.\n\n10/10 would danmaku again.","June 11, 2014","true","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Crimzon Clover is one of those games, but contrary to popular belief, bullet hell games are not impossible; very difficult yes, but not impossible. In fact, Crimzon Clover is one of the more forgiving games in the genre in most modes, and it's a great game to get into the genre with as I'll later explain:\nThe original Crimzon Clover was an indie game released by CLOVER-TAC, a player with a few world record bullet hell game scores: this original release was a Japan only, physical disc only release (which is now out of print). Despite the fact this was an indie release, the original game had pretty impressive production values, comparable to bullet hell games released by major developers like CAVE\n[ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAVE_(company) ]\nDue to this success, the game was picked up for distribution in Japanese arcades by Taito through their line of Nesica digital download capable arcade machines. For this arcade release the game recieved a new shiny coat of paint, a new game mode (replacing an old mode in the original), and a few gameplay touch ups. This Steam release is a port of the arcade version.\n\nNow onto the actual game: You can select from two overall difficulty settings: Arcade and Novice. These names explain themselves, as Arcade difficulty is the same as the arcade machine's difficulty setting (tough but fair), while novice mode tones down the difficulty a bit to allow new comers to try out this genre of game without too much frustration. Once you select a difficulty, you get to pick from three different gameplay modes: Original, which is basically the default style of gameplay, Boost mode, where the game difficulty dynamically increases based on how long you stay in break mode (explained later), and Unlimited mode, which usually looks like that video I linked above. Gameplay is standard, fly, shoot and dodge, with bullets only killing you if they hit the small golden orb in your ship's center, but there are three mechanics that are a bit different from most bullet hell games: in most bullet hell games you get a few smart bombs every life that you can trigger instantly to destroy all bullets on the screen. In crimzon clover however you get an energy meter that fills up as you score points; once you reach a certain point on the meter (the point goes further up the meter with each bomb you use in a life), you can trigger a bomb. However, if you let the meter fill all the way up, you can enter Break mode, where your ship gets a big power increase and your main point multiplier is pumped up until the timer runs out (except in Boost mode where you have to manually end break mode with a bomb). Furthermore, if you can fill up the meter a second time before break mode ends, you can enter double break mode, where your ship gets even more powerful and your multiplier jumps even higher. The third mechanic that's a bit different is the lock on system. Besides your standard forward shot, you can hold the lock on button to create a transparent barrier around you: any enemy that enters this barrier gets locked onto (you can lock onto the same enemy multiple times as well), and as soon as you release the lock on button, you release quick homing lasers or missiles at whatever you targeted; furthermore the more enemies you destroy in a single lock on burst, the higher your secondary score multiplier (which vanishes after a short time) becomes.. With these mechanics in place, Crimzon Clover is much more forgiving than most bullet hell games, but that doesn't mean it's not a challenge to beat without continues: you will be beaten down over and over until you memorize bullet patterns and refine your dodging skills (beating a bullet hell game by using continues means nothing by the way!). However, if you do manage to conquer this game, you'll feel an incredible sense of accomplishment and pride that you could never get from the majority of mainstream AAA titles that hold your hand every step of the way. Despite the game's short length (5-7 stages, I can't remember the exact number), this game holds tremendous amounts of replay value for those who are willing to take it seriously: the inital challenge to beat original mode without continues could take a player any amount of hours from 10 to 100, and afterwards there's always the allure of a new high score, not to mention the other two modes.\n\nBottom Line: if you like retro games like those for the NES, incredibly tough modern games like Dark Souls or I wanna be the guy, or if you just want a change from the other games on the market, give this game a shot: it's very rare for bullet hell games to be released outside of Japan, and this happens to be one of the best in recent memory.\n\nEDIT: I neglected to mention two other features: There is also a time attack mode where you're thrown into a unique stage with unlimited lives for three minutes to try and get a high score. Speaking of high scores, there are online leaderboards, and you have the ability to save replays of your playthroughs.","June 8, 2014","true","6.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'd feel bad giving this game a negative review, but honestly I'm not hugely impressed either.\n\nThe screen consists of 45% gold stars, 45% shiny numbers, and maybe 10% of bullets. For a bullet hell it's way too fast and chaotic, and for a shmup it's just incomprehensible. Sure, collecting gold stars and seeing huge numeric scores makes you think you're achieving something, but it's just an illusion. It's not to say the game is easy or poorly designed, but outside of it being flashy it's not really anything special. It's easy to get into, but difficult to master, yet falls on the casual side of things, especially if you consider the unlimited continues. Other than that the graphics are nice, the music is catchy, and three selectable fighters offer three different playstyles.\n\nRegardless, after beating the game a few times I've just had enough, and don't really feel encouraged to play again, despite there being several gameplay modes. Maybe it's just me, but I'd rather play a shmup with tighter controls and more comprehensible visuals.

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #35 - Crimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION\n\nI haven't really played very many modern shoot em up games.  My history is more with the old school arcade shooters like Galaga and Galaxian.  Playing this is like seeing these old games on steroids.\n\nLuckily for me, the game provides a choice of difficulty when starting a new game.  So novice players like myself can start with the Novice difficulty instead of Arcade difficulty.  You also get a choice of different modes to play in.  For the Novice difficulty I had the choice of Original or Boost mode.  They looked largely the same except Boost mode modifies the difficulty based on skill.  There is also an Unlimited and Time Attack mode, but these aren't available in the Novice difficulty.  I started with the Original mode.\n\nYou get an optional tutorial at the beginning to get a feel of the controls.  I liked that even as a modern shooter, the controls are still pretty simple to pick up.  You have the obvious controls of moving your ship around and firing your main gun.  You also get a secondary weapon where holding down the button will lock onto enemies.  Then when you let off the button you'll fire at everything that has been locked on to.\n\nThe third button I found pretty interesting as it does a couple of different things.  The game has a break mode gauge that fills as you kill enemies.  If you press the button, you'll drop a bomb which is basically an attack that hits the entire screen, but it also has the bonus of making you invulnerable for a short time.  But if the break mode gauge is full, then instead of dropping a bomb you go into "break mode"  In this mode your firepower increases big time for a short duration.  It's also possible to stack up 2 break mode gauges and get a double break mode, which will increase your firepower even more.\n\nAll of these weapons can be fired independently.  So for instance while you are firing your main gun at whatever is in front of you, you could be locking on to enemies to your side.  I found myself hitting the bomb at key times when it looked like I'd be unable to dodge the enemy bullets, so I'd get that bit of invulnerability.\n\nThe game starts out at a somewhat leisurely pace, but it doesn't take long for things to pick up, and the later levels really get crazy.  But I really appreciated the fact that the developers kept the game very accessible.  In the novice mode I played, I got all the continues I wanted after losing all of my lives.  In the latter stages that happened a lot.  But it seems the developers want you to be able to complete the game, and then focus on getting better at it.  So for the very casual player, you can still have fun blasting your way through the levels and dying a lot without any real penalty.\n\nThe 2D graphics are very nice.  There were some parts of the game it got so crazy it started looking like one of those visualizers you see in a music player or a screensaver.  I also really liked the soundtrack and thought it was perfect as the backdrop for an arcade shoot em up.\n\nIf you are already a shoot em up fan, then you probably already have this game or don't really need any convincing to pick it up.  But for the more casual players, I can still recommend this game, but you might want to catch it on sale.","October 10, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game's difficulty becomes crazy and goes at a exciting pace.\n-Great visuals.\n-A super energetic soundtrack that pumps out the adrendaline these kind of games have.\n\nNitpicks:\n-Too much flair and numbers around the screen may make it a bit difficult to see what's going on but the bullets are colored specifically so they are much easier to see.\n\nCons:\n-I don't have any\n\nDiscussion:\nBullet Hells aren't something I really play a lot. The closest I got to one was Galaga Legions DX, and that was in some form way too easy to even match the challenge of Crimzon Clover. Crimzon Clover is freaking awesome. It has so much stuff cluttered (Which is kind of something I'm a bit ehh at) but the bullets and enemy fire are much easier to see. You have to focus less on shooting enemies and more about dodging the fire, since your bullet spread is pretty much 1/3rds of the entire screen. It's a full embodiment of the Bullet Hell genre.\n\nIt almost seems bizzare that the Japanese indie scene isn't that large here. Like seriously, if indie games were the face of powerful innovation and fun, the japanese market is a great example of that.\n\nIf you are looking for a Bullet Hell, say no further to Crimzon Clover: WORLD IGNITION. This is the defining example of Bullet Hells, and is just straight up fun.

You get 4 kinds of ships, one is unlockable, all ships only differ in shot width and movement speed. Basically this is some nice old fashioned arcade action. You fill your gauge up and get breaker and double breaker modes, doubling then trippling your fire power.\n\nWhen you activate that breaker mode, you unload on your enemies, they start exploding, the screen starts shaking, god damn it's a good feeling. You also have this other weapon, basically a missle system. You hold the button down, enemies around you get marked, then when you release the button, missiles get fired at them; while you hold this button down, you move a bit slower.\n\nWhy do I not recomend this game though? Because of 2 flaws:\n\n1.) Your ship moves way too freaken fast, every ship has two speeds, fast as ♥♥♥♥, and too fast. As you need to dodge a lot of bullets in this game, many of which slow moving, that means you need to move through some pretty tight spaces. Try doing that at top speed, you can't be precise enough to survive. The slowest speed your ship goes, is just too fast.\n\n2.) The slow down button is also an attack button. So when you hold down the missle button, you move slow, but when you release it to fire the missiles, you suddenly go super sonic speed. And since your holding then releasing the button often, you basically shift from moving ultra fast, to just fast. Try dodge bullets while doing this! In the later levels, there are some things that you need to kill as fast as possible, while dodging bullets. So that means holding and releasing the missle button, which makes to shift speeds. It is agonizing.\n\nAside from that the game is just very generic, theres nothing really new in terms of weapons or level design. Despite that, it could still be fun if not for the above problems.\n\nI must say I do enjoy the game up to the end of level 2, but level 3 and beyond it becomes purely anoying.","January 28","false","16.1"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","14"

But dont pay for it.\n\nFirst off, the screen size, while it can be resized in a rather wonky way, is unplayable unless you already know the key layout or are in a mood to experiment. The buttons youre looking for are Z (a.k.a. start. wtf) x, c, v and the arrow keys.\n\nThe game screen itself even in full screen mode is about the size of a sheet of paper, since the borders on the left and right (which youll probably never even look at. i didnt) take up a third of the screen. EACH.\n\nI'm guessing that my experience with top down shooters is limited compared to the people who overwhelmingly loved this game. I have played classics like life force, gunsmoke, the rtype series, UN squadron, stuff like that on classic consoles. This game is by FAR nothing like those. In this one, instead of playing a game where you pilot a ship to avoid and shoot down enemies, you play some kind of super powered ship of absolute destruction while you try and rhythmically charge lock-on screen wiping bombs and dodge the bullets that some of the (im guessing enemies since EVERYTHING is constantly obscured by massive explosions) manage to squeeze out. there is no point in trying to manuever for a shot, your ♥♥♥♥ hits practically everything at all times. The only time you need to move at all is if a bullet is going to hit you. In some rare cases, larger enemies and bosses that take more hits will constantly barrage you with undodgeable on hit kill bullets while you try to maneuver (lel) and hit your. . . other. . . bombs and breaks for the breif peroid of invulnerability that will allow you to not lose a life. Not that it matters.\n\nThis game boils down to ' hold z, rhymically hoold and release x, be ready to press c if bullets are going to hit you and press v to continue.\n\nIf you like shooting at explosions, and wiggling around a little, then this game is great.\n\nthis game looks like someone watcheed someone playing diablo 3 for 20 seconds, and tried to turn that information into a game.","October 10, 2015","false","0.3"," 5 of 34 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","5","34","0","3"

This is the first time I've found a scoring system to be both intuitive and entertaining in an arcade style game and the two game modes I've tried managed to offer different game experiences without changing fundamental mechanics (Deathsmiles, I'm still mad at you).  Almost all of the enemies and attacks are well choreographed with the appropriate lead in making the whole game feel "fair" and drastically reducing the number of insta-gibs on bullet spawn on the first playthrough.\n\nThere's no real story or plot to speak of here and while the sound track does a good job setting the pace and mood of the game, it doesn't particularly stand out compared to other titles in the genre.  The artwork is great and there's plenty of juice to go around, but it may seem busy at times or come across a bit dull to those who are tired of sci-fi/spaceships.  Your profile won't get wrecked by achievements, the vast majority of which can be earned with persistence rather than skill.  After playing through each ship and once in boost mode on the novice difficulty I've "earned" over half of them with a few challenge types left for those who want to show off their skill.\n\nTL;DR - This game excels the most where it counts, awesome core gameplay.

It really nailed home why I fell in love with the genre as a kid and fell in love all over again when I rediscovered it as an adult.\n\nAt first it doesn't seem much to look at, and sonically it borders on the annoying, but give it a few minutes. The detail in the pixel art I can only describe as beautiful. It's not traditionally aesthetically pleasing, but it challenges that notion affably. The music? It quickly becomes part of the game. You don't hear it as much as you are involved in it, as a player of the game.\n\nOn the challenge front, it starts somewhat slowly. The first level felt more akin to a run'n'gun than a dyed-in-the-wool bullet hell, but the game takes that perception and slaps you round the face with it. By the time you're on the final novice level, you're dodging more bullets than some of the genre's big-hitters, twitching more than dodging due to its sheer pace.\n\nFinally, the bosses. Man I had fun beating Diabolos. There's just something about the way they're designed. They're not your typical shmup boss with different bullet patterns and transformations alone setting them apart. These--machines though they are--feel much more organic. They feel like bosses. They change things up. They do things that surprise you. After destroying the legs of an arachnid, it frigging bounces on you. I did not expect that!\n\nI can't recommend this game enough. It feels novel and classic all at the same time.","May 30, 2015","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought I had forgotten those flames with age and indifference...this game brought out in me an emotion I thought I had long forgotten for bullet hells...ambition.\n\nI am a very average player.  I have beaten all main Touhou games on normal, with 2 extras (11,13).  But it took all my energy and dedication to even reach that point. I also own most of Orange Juice Create games (AOS, Suguri, Sora QP shooting etc.).  I also own a few other Shumps/Bullet Hells/Bullet curtains like Stellavanity, Exceed, Hellsinker, Kachiverse, and Astebreed.  These days, when-ever I boot up a bullet hell, I would sigh as I would get smacked by a random projectile...on the first stage.  Then I'd promptly turn it off and play something else.\n\nThis game though, it has  a certain charm, it makes me want to try.  So far I have reached the 3rd stage midboss on arcade mode.  The scoring system is also very appealing, with chains rewarding good players, and encouraging mediocre players like me to improve, so I may reach a higher score (and those all important extra lives!).\n\nVery satisfied with my purchase, thanks for re-igniting my bullet hell fire.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GracedbyAutumn/recommended/285440/","GracedbyAutumn","Graced by Autumn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GracedbyAutumn/","800 products in account","It’s no secret that the presence of shmups has witnessed a decline over the past several years. While some might argue that such an occurrence is par for the course; given that the genre has always found its roots in arcades which have also become exceedingly rare; there are many who would nevertheless consider it a great shame to see a whole genre on the verge of disappearing altogether. Attempts have been made to breathe fresh life into the scrolling shooter, but the number that has been met with favourable commercial and critical results has always fallen shorter than what most shmup fans would have liked to have witnessed. It should be of great interest then to those invested in the fate of the genre to know that Crimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION is a shmup that comes of only the highest quality.\n\nCrimzon Clover began as a Flash game developed by YOTSUBANE in 2011. After being re-released two years later in Japanese arcades the game was finally remade into what you have here: Crimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION – an international version of the surprise-hit arcade title. There doesn’t appear to be any overarching narrative to accompany the action of Crimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION and if there is, then it’s safe to say that it’s nowhere to be found in the game. Then again, games of this nature aren’t known for their need of any grand story in order to deliver the experience expected by their target audience.\n\nThe core gameplay of Crimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION revolves around the concept of the Break Gauge. After choosing from one of four different ships the player is presented with five stages of increasing difficulty, each of which is played in sequence. Defeating enemies using either the standard, forward-firing attack or the powerful homing attack releases scoring items and gradually fills the aforementioned gauge. When the gauge exceeds one of two thresholds the player is granted the ability to use a ‘bomb’ which could be useful should the bullet count start to pile up beyond what one might find manageable otherwise. Refraining from using a bomb enables the gauge to fill even further and upon exceeding a second threshold it becomes possible to enter Break Mode. Doing so dramatically increases the player’s firepower and includes the added benefit of raking in more points, though it should be noted that Break Mode only lasts a limited period of time, after which the player’s attack power and scoring capabilities both return to the default level.\n\nIt’s a great idea that employs the use of several short-term goals to encourage a very aggressive playstyle, one that sees the player always seeking to make the most of their time spent in Break Mode, and immediately looking to re-enter the mode as swiftly as possible following its closure. Enemy placement has been well thought out: weak but fast enemies appear in great numbers often to shield stronger opponents hiding further up the screen. This provides the player with a good opportunity to build up their score multiplier before going after the targets that are worth the most points. The fact that this formula pertaining to the arrangement of enemy formations persists throughout the entire game; and that it consistently yields itself to create a satisfying set of dynamics; is what makes Crimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION so impressive. It would be hard to find any obvious flaws in the game’s level designs, and for that YOTSUBANE and Adventure Planning Service are to be applauded.\n\nThe game includes four different modes of play, most of which can be played solo or with a second player through local co-op. The Original mode of play enables the player to extend their offensive capabilities even further upon breaching a third threshold in order to enter Double Break Mode, while the Boost mode of play automatically forces the player to enter Break Mode upon reaching the second threshold. As long as Break Mode remains active, one’s score increases, although this also comes at the expense of the enemies putting up more of a fight too. The Unlimited mode of play is a true test of how well one knows the game and it wouldn’t be inaccurate to describe it as being one of the most satisfying and rewarding aspects of the game. It puts players in the hot zone from the very beginning and doesn’t let up until all is said and done. Players who have the stomach for it will likely come back to this mode of play time and time again. Last but not least is the Time Attack mode of play, a short, single-player venture in which the player aims to earn as many points as possible within a limited period of time on a stage unique to that mode. Lives are unlimited but that doesn’t make Time Attack any less demanding; nor any less enjoyable; than the rest of the game.\n\nCrimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION excels in the aesthetics department too. Each of the sprites has been made with meticulous detail, the bullets and various environments all sport a wide variety of different colours and overall the visual feedback provided to the player is excellent while soundtrack falls nothing short of being amazing. To some extent it looks like some degree of inspiration has been drawn from CAVE’s DonPachi series, particularly in regards to the appearance of the scoring items and some of the enemy designs. It might be nice to have a centralized element of the UI that displays the remaining amount of Break Mode time the player has left at their disposal, rather than having to take one’s eyes away from the action to check a panel positioned on the left side of the screen, and it wouldn’t hurt to have a boss health gauge display that becomes transparent when the player’s ship passes through it either, but both of these are minor issues and don’t do any great harm to the overall presentation.\n\nIn short it would be sufficient to say that Crimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION is everything a bullet hell game should be. Highly polished, highly refined and highly enjoyable, it’s exactly the type of game that arcades could have done with several years ago, and is certainly one that those in search of a worthwhile scrolling shooter could do with today. With developers like YOTSUBANE and Adventure Planning Service around, one can rest assured that the future of the genre lies in good hands.","September 14, 2015","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beelzeburbia/recommended/285440/","beelzeburbia","Rite Aid | Jackie Sparkles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beelzeburbia/","96 products in account","I came here to get one thing off my chest (and my slight aching right thumb that held down both the fire button and the lock button for a long time on my PS3 controller/gamepad), and it is this:\n\nTHIS GAME IS FRICKIN' AMAZING.\n\nI would've said that other word that starts with F, but that's not important to mention. That, and Steam would replace the word with heart symbols.\n\nBut why is this game, as you put it, "FRICKIN' AMAZING"? Well, my friend, as per most modern day shmups go, this game is ridiculously fast paced, and on top of that, a vast amount of challenge and reward (in the form of big scores and shiny stars). Also, bullets and laser beams will be filling your screen around a good 90%-95% of the time in a playthrough.\n\nThe game comes with four modes: Boost, Original, Unlimited, and Time Attack.\n\nBoost is a mode that adapts to your skill and playing style (but mostly the former), in a mode where you have unlimited Break Mode (there will be more on that later) once you get it activated. Truly a fun mode for those who are into earning big points, big stars, and firing gigantic, powerful lasers at a barrage of enemies.\n\nOriginal, as you may expect, is a mode that emulates the original Arcade release of the game on your computer within the comfort of your home (or in my case, all over the place, given the fact that I play on a laptop).\n\nUnlimited is essentially Original mode but with the difficulty pushed to the absolute limits. For those who can 1CC Mushihimesama Futari or reach the second run of DoDonPachi with ease, this is for you.\n\nTime Attack is a mode that asks you this question (not in the game, but in the case of me trying to explain this mode): "How many enemies and how many points can you score in the time given?" You have unlimited lives, but, as expected, you don't have unlimited time. If you ask me, it's one of my personal favorite modes in the game.\n\nAll of the modes are fast paced and fun to play around with. I suggest tinkering around with each one and see if you can find your favorite.\n\nIn addition to the four modes, there just so happen to be four ships to play as: Type-I, Type-II, Type-III, and Type-Z; the last one being an unlockable through playing the game and collecting medals associated with completing certain tasks in each mode; such as completing the first level without dying with each ship.\n\nOne mechanic that definitely had me grinning was Break Mode; a mode where you can wreak havoc on many ships with a temporary damage upgrade to your ship by filling up the meter (that also acts as your bomb once it passes a red line) in its entirety. There is also a narrow bar under the bigger bar that you'll be focusing on, and this can play a major role in storing up a Double Break Mode opportunity. Double Break Mode is essentially Break Mode, but twice as powerful as regular Break Mode and the Break Mode timer is twice as long; and from there, the points start piling up at a rapid pace.\n\nIf anything, all I can say is: BUY THIS GAME. And at the time of this writing (during the Steam Summer Sale), it's only $2.49; so there's no reason not to get it.\n\nHappy shooting down ships!\n...And insects.\n...And tanks.\nYAY.","June 13, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

THIS GAME....\n\nAs a fan of Touhou, When I first saw this game I knew I would enjoy it. I love tons of bullets on screen, and I love the feel of weaving through them all, just in general. Solid music, seemed to have good tempo...\n\nBut I just finally got my chance to poke through this game (no cc clearing, mind) and... This game is so good. I was giggling with glee as I played this through. The lock on mechanic gives you the normal focus slowdown along with a bigger arc of fire. Breaking feels so good, like shoving your ship into overdrive- until you mess up and while your screaming "POWAAAAH!!!!" your break shield drops, you get hit, and it gets cut off as quickly as you start it (nevermind the DOUBLE BREAK). Maybe it's just me, but this game requires some serious aggression to survive with a no CC (more then i may do.). Who knows if ill ever no CC this one.\n\nThe different modes of the game change the script. Original is good enough, but adding Time Attack, Boost Mode (managing it), and then the BRUTAL Unlimited mode... combine it with the overall feel of flight (and speed) and some of the neat pass through effects (moving through some of the clouds in one of the levels.), and this has been an utter JOY to play.\n\nTLDR: Rended to shreds by the bullet fire, and enjoyed it to crazy degrees.

It's my favorite SHMUP of all time.  Even if you're not into SHMUPS, it's well worth picking up.\n\nThe original OST is amazing and matches the gameplay perfectly.\n\nYou have access to a crazy amount of firepower - which gets even more ridiculous when you activate limit break.. and then double-limit break after that.  It's kind of like going Super Saiyan level 4.\n\nThere's so much stuff on-screen at once.  Dozens of enemies, lasers filling the screen, explosions of score bonuses/bling .  The bullet patterns from enemies are just beautiful.  But at the same time it's not frustrating unlike other SHMUPS, since you have a lot of tools and firepower to make use of.   There's a built in system where doing more damage and chaining builds up your limit break meter, which can be used for bombs, temporary invincibility or Saiyan mode - it's dynamic and doesn't rely on drops from enemies. You can also get lives more frequently than other SHMUPs.\n\n9.5/10 Everything about the game is close to perfection.","August 11, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beelzeburbia/recommended/285440/","beelzeburbia","Rite Aid | Jackie Sparkles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beelzeburbia/","96 products in account","I came here to get one thing off my chest (and my slight aching right thumb that held down both the fire button and the lock button for a long time on my PS3 controller/gamepad), and it is this:\n\nTHIS GAME IS FRICKIN' AMAZING.\n\nI would've said that other word that starts with F, but that's not important to mention. That, and Steam would replace the word with heart symbols.\n\nBut why is this game, as you put it, "FRICKIN' AMAZING"? Well, my friend, as per most modern day shmups go, this game is ridiculously fast paced, and on top of that, a vast amount of challenge and reward (in the form of big scores and shiny stars). Also, bullets and laser beams will be filling your screen around a good 90%-95% of the time in a playthrough.\n\nThe game comes with four modes: Boost, Original, Unlimited, and Time Attack.\n\nBoost is a mode that adapts to your skill and playing style (but mostly the former), in a mode where you have unlimited Break Mode (there will be more on that later) once you get it activated. Truly a fun mode for those who are into earning big points, big stars, and firing gigantic, powerful lasers at a barrage of enemies.\n\nOriginal, as you may expect, is a mode that emulates the original Arcade release of the game on your computer within the comfort of your home (or in my case, all over the place, given the fact that I play on a laptop).\n\nUnlimited is essentially Original mode but with the difficulty pushed to the absolute limits. For those who can 1CC Mushihimesama Futari or reach the second run of DoDonPachi with ease, this is for you.\n\nTime Attack is a mode that asks you this question (not in the game, but in the case of me trying to explain this mode): "How many enemies and how many points can you score in the time given?" You have unlimited lives, but, as expected, you don't have unlimited time. If you ask me, it's one of my personal favorite modes in the game.\n\nAll of the modes are fast paced and fun to play around with. I suggest tinkering around with each one and see if you can find your favorite.\n\nIn addition to the four modes, there just so happen to be four ships to play as: Type-I, Type-II, Type-III, and Type-Z; the last one being an unlockable through playing the game and collecting medals associated with completing certain tasks in each mode; such as completing the first level without dying with each ship.\n\nOne mechanic that definitely had me grinning was Break Mode; a mode where you can wreak havoc on many ships with a temporary damage upgrade to your ship by filling up the meter (that also acts as your bomb once it passes a red line) in its entirety. There is also a narrow bar under the bigger bar that you'll be focusing on, and this can play a major role in storing up a Double Break Mode opportunity. Double Break Mode is essentially Break Mode, but twice as powerful as regular Break Mode and the Break Mode timer is twice as long; and from there, the points start piling up at a rapid pace.\n\nIf anything, all I can say is: BUY THIS GAME. And at the time of this writing (during the Steam Summer Sale), it's only $2.49; so there's no reason not to get it.\n\nHappy shooting down ships!\n...And insects.\n...And tanks.\nYAY.","June 13, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While this is easily one of the hardest shoot 'em ups ever made when played on the hardest difficulity - on the easier settings it is toned down enough that it's still fun to play and actually possible for less experienced players to beat it on one credit.\n\nAs far as gripes go, they are mainly just nitpicks. With only 5 levels (aside from a special time attack level) it is fairly short, and there isn't much content to unlock aside from 1 new ship and a secret boss (which ironically you can play right from the start of the game simply by selecting it in practice mode).\n\nThere are also a few music bugs which will hopefully be fixed with a new patch; after completing a game the music clips when returning to the title screen, and when reaching the secret boss the music does not play unless you pause the game and then unpause it.

For those who aren't new to this genre the scoring system may feel overly simple compared to other titles(I will talk about this in a second).\n\nSo what are the aspects of this game that I really enjoy?\n\nSimple Game Mechanics - It's very easy to pick up from the intro 'How to play' cutscene.\n\nPretty Graphics - Every stage feels and looks different giving it variety and keeping it interesting to look at.\n\nBoss Variety - I was surprised at the amount of mid bosses and end stage bosses this game offers. They're all very reminiscent of bosses from other well known shmups so the familiarity for those who know what they're based on is a lot of fun.\n\nSoundtrack - This game has phenominal music!\n\nReplayability - With the multiple modes and achievements you can always find a new goal to work towards.\n\nNo Loli - Do you even know how rare this is nowadays? A shmup that doesn't feel like it'd get you put in prison outside of Japan?\nThe things I don't particularly enjoy about this game. (These are mostly personal opinions, but I thought I'd share my thoughts anyway.)\n\nDoujin Bullets - You know what I'm talking about, the infinite amount of perfect white circles that just move across the screen slowly like something out of agar.io. This in no way affects the gameplay but I feel they make the appearance bland.\n\nPaper Fan Explosions - When things blow up in this game they have that echo-like paper fan noise to them, just like Touhou games. Why is this so common?\n\nSimple Scoring System - This is NOT a bad thing. If anything it makes it much easier for people to figure out that there are more complex scoring mechanics in shmups. BUT, if you come from games like Espgaluda 2, Muchi Muchi Pork, or pretty much anything Shinobu Yagawa made this game's scoring mechanics can feel extremely simple.\n\nNo Replays on Ranking Scoreboard - Oh, you want me to buy the superplays and not be able to see how others play? How about no.\nIn conclusion, this game has small things that rub my fur the wrong way but for most players, especially if you don't play as many arcade shmups as some of us, it probably won't bother you. If I had to compare this game to other titles I'd say it feels like something between a Takumi title and a Cave title.\n\nI got this game as part of a Humble Bundle but for $10 I'd definitely have paid that for it. That price beats paying $40-$100 for Japanese imports for 360 so if you're wanting some fun, bullet hell gameplay I'd give it a shot. (Get it? A shot? Hah...

For the keen eye Cave's two color shot and speeds with score system and hyper mode (aka Break Mode) , some layer locking and secondary shot slowdown, AND even Cho Ren Sha's "trinity" Power-up all says you're in for a good time. Seriously the amount of cues to the now staple systems for vertical games is very refreshing and respectful, one could keep this title as a reference for those who are just getting into or interested in the genre.\n\nAnother note is that the whole package feels right, especially for the balanced use of freeware and in-house assets. The shot, ship, and swarm speeds are all there and on point. The different mode further tailor the experience to your battle mood. Simply solid delivery across the arcade board.\n\nAbout the only thing I'm holdong out for, if not hoping for is the incoming titles to have a "sweet definiton" - that one token mechanic that you notice that says iconic. Double Break mode is a close second, still leaves me wanting more.\nC. Clover as a whole has near iconic quality, yet for it to make its own would really shine. I want the feels, the excitement is only one part.\n\nMind you though, the above is just an over time sentement. This is a key modern arcade shooter for the budding pilot and 'core grazer' alike.\n\n","January 17","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But something about the way this game is produced just gives it the feeling of "♥♥♥♥ MAN I DUNNO HERE'S A LOT OF BULLETS, ALSO HERE'S SOME MORE BULLETS". And that's all it is, and all it needs to be.\n\nGood music too.\n\n","May 5","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Non-Bullet Hell fans, really, do not miss out on getting good at this game, you won't go wrong starting with this title. In generic terms. this game's controls are really tight, soundtrack has you immersed in the beautiful light shows of mass destruction. The boss fights only escalate in a cresscendo of thrills and satisfaction upon victories. The levels and patters are tough, but also really fair. It ends up being your fault for getting courner in a fight where you had to draw an eight figure until they're down, for example.\n\nIn game-related, the Break system is pretty brilliant. Shoot down as many targets as you can, hold it up, and get great shot power. Or dispense your charges and neatly clean up the entire screen of bullets and enemies whenever you find yourself in a corner. The three modes will help you learn to pilot each ship, but there is a lot of potential in exploring a lot of ways to beat the highest score, as well as your test of tenacity and determination.","May 5","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShoottheCore/recommended/285440/","ShoottheCore","ZAKO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShoottheCore/","306 products in account","One of the best shmups on Steam. Crimzon Clover offers a fairly CAVE-like experience, but stands alone enough for those that want something a little bit different from a real CAVE game. The break mechanic is interesting and will give you plenty of game time figuring out just the right time to use it. There are plenty of different modes on offer, including Boost mode (Variable Difficulty), the original Arcade mode, the obligatory super hard Unlimited mode, and a seperate Time Attack mode for you scorechasers out there. If you've never played a bullet hell game and want to see if the genre is for you, Crimzon Clover is a great starting point.\n\nThe DLC is largely skippable, but I found the Superplay DLC to be quite useful in helping improving my scores. It is a very niche product, however. The real value comes from the included commentary from the players, rather than the replays themselves.","April 22","true","50.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a bar that you can fill if you damage foes, gives you a way to bomb, or far, deal a special effect regarding the game mode.\nDestroying enemies or cancelling bullets give you stars, reach a required amount of stars gives you a life, truely important, but also affect the bullet's speed if you don't want to be screwed.\n\nIt includes 4 modes by his own gameplay style with 3 ships which determines speed and shot style (with a hidden one).\n\nBoost is a Rank based mode, filling the bar makes enemy bullets more faster and summons sucide bullets (those tiny pellets when a enemy dies), making the game more frustrating but has a higher score to deal.\nOriginal is a CAVE style mode, the bar is used as a time-limited hyper mode (calls Break mode) feature, you can also use a break twice for better scoring.\nUnlimited has the same system as Original but adds a bullet cancel method and harder bullet patterns (and a different soundtrack, but you can modify with the originals).\nTime Attack is a caravan timed mode with a unique stage, like Star Soldier games.\n\nSo maybe I can tell that I played the doujin version on 2010 too.\nThe difference compared to his doujin version and World Ignition is that all those modes has almost the same difficulty I can deal as a arcade game in WI. Different patterns, different mechanics (especially Boost), and different extend system r.i.p.\nLuckily there's a "Novice" difficulty for scrubs, highly recommended to use it.\n\nThere's also a training to practice absurb stages and bosses with any difficult ways, a replay feature if you want to watch some footages you love, and a online leaderboard, beat your friends.\n\nOverall, it's a great game, but really hard, and you will die, a lot.\n\n(Sorry if there's some bad english typos, I'm French.)","February 7","true","52.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
