You started with some wierd kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized (b4$t4rd|z3d, wordfilter lol!) rusty VW-beetlecar with built in machineguns and armorplating welded on to it. The car was crap, and you knew it, but that was the point. After many many races where you sometimes knew very well you had no chance in hell of winning the race, you soldiered on, staying out of harms way of the neo-corvette juggernauts that you hoped of one day obtaining.\n\nThis game has missed the point totaly. After playing the game for an hour and unlocking cars and weapons, I'm sad to say that this game is not a worthy remake. It's got a cheap plastic feel to it in many ways and here are some examples of what went wrong:\n\nYou're not at liberty to save money when you repair and upgrade your car after a race. All acquired money has to be spent there and then, therefore it effectively removes the economic dimension from the game, and with that removes all strategy from the game.\n\nGear and cars are not bought, they are collected on the race track as parts and once all parts are collected you get your mines or machinegun or new car. What was given to you will not be valued. Therefore the game is not about upgrades since new gear doesn't come from you spending your resources to get them.\n\nYour car has auto-fire on the built-in machinegun, you dont even have to pull the trigger to use the weapon and ammo never runs out. I shouldn't have to explain how wrong this is. There are other secondary weapons though that require ammo and triggerpulling, but thats beside the point.\n\nThere are some other points that I could make about thats wrong with this game, but what has already been written will suffice. Technically this game might be well made from a programming point if view, the problems is that the designers of the game had no idea what they were doing.","October 8, 2014","false","1.0"," 63 of 72 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","63","72","3","2"

I was honestly excited by the idea of the Death Rally game being remade and hopefully expanded. Instead what we seem to have is essentially a mobile game scaled up that has a lot of the words in common with Death Rally but feels like it misses on a few important cylinders.\n\nDeath Rally was a half race and half car-carnage game and it pulled it together well though sometimes a bit cheesy. Fun could be had as the races really felt like skill made a big difference and timing your mines and machine gun fire to destroy opponents in your way was rewarding though not trivial. Through the game, you got money which you needed to restock supplies like ammo or armor, upgrade your car a bit or buy new cars/weapons.\n\nThis version feels like the dumbed down iOS port that it really is. Money now only is here to buy upgrades to the car and repair it. The upgrades feel like they make almost no difference in gameplay (except armor which did actually seem to prolong life). But as a racing game, getting better cars or engines did not make me feel like I was going faster. I've read that even the best car with the best engine does not go faster than the initial car an opponent drives in a beginner race. It makes the upgrades feel definitely token.\n\nThere is also no real money management. In fact, after a race, the game seems to expect you to just spend all of your money since ammo is restocked at the beginning of a race anyway. New weapons and cars are unlocked after collecting a certain number of pieces scattered on tracked on dropped from destroyed opponents. It feels like progression in this game could be substituted for attrition. I remember in the original sometimes being in a bad place because I took a loan I couldn't pay back. This made decisions feel like they meant something. Also, additional objectives in the original again meant something since money mattered. Here, they are a yes/no box you click periodically and see if it works. It feels sometimes like an Office product had a pop up with the title "Fun" and boxes that just say yes and no appeared with no real context or consequence to the action.\n\nYes you do advance faster from placing higher, but it still doesn't feel significant enough. After all, winning a race seems to come mostly down to well placed nitro boosts at the end.\n\nThe destruction of opponents seems like an area where this could shine. Unfortunately, there are things in the way of allowing you to really get the full enjoyment from the experience. Your base machine gun automatically shoots for you (after you add your 1 additional gun upgrade). This feels annoying at best since you have unlimited ammo and it's not always shooting, but you have no control over it. Even better is in-race bonuses (repair, money, ammo) are in boxes that must be shot... so you have  to hope an opponent is in front of you near a box so you could happen to shoot that (and they not just take your bonus) or you waste some of your limited ammo.\n\nThis is a small gripe, but the in level bonuses do need to be shot and all appear at the beginning of the level. Since shooting can be wasteful and feel a bit random, this means that upgrades you need later are hard to get and running into repairs within seconds of the race starting is common. It just feels like a bad decision. The original randomly spawned them on the track, IIRC, and that was fine. This isn't a realistic game; why must we pretend periodically that it is?\n\nOpponents suffer from what a lot of games have with enemies that don't have the same limitations as you. I've mentioned their cars are always fast enough to rival yours no matter what. They also have unlimited ammo in their nicer weapons compared to the 4 shots you get in some of your weapons. This is especially terrible in the deathmatch sections where destroying cars is the goal yet they don't have to worry about ammo limits. Additionally, they have health like you do. When you hit 0%, you explode and are done. When they hit 0%, their health bar flashes... and they continue to race for a while. Some number of shots into them later (or maybe it's time? I couldn't definitively understand the logic but it seemed inconsistant and like I wasted a lot of ammo trying to kill a single target), they will in fact explode. You have no real indicator of when this is going to happen though, so I frequently found myself passing them and hoping to get their drop on the next lap if they happened to blow up. Though they can still shoot you in this state.\n\nSpeaking about laps, one of the biggest places this feels like a mobile game is in the race length. I'm not saying I need long races, but I do feel like the fact that most races take <=1 minute to complete takes away from my enjoyment. That could just be a preference, though.\n\nAll this is not to say there is no fun to be had. I was entertained for a while. I could see this being more reasonable on a device without a gamepad or keyboard (I never did get my 360 controller to work with this game) like a tablet or phone where simple games are more acceptable. I at least wanted more. I wanted to feel like I had consequences or choices. I wanted to feel like my ability mattered. Instead, I was watching a nice looking (not amazing by any means, but it does look nice enough... if you don't look too closely at the textures) but repetative and short car chase scene from various movies. Things happen, but the ending never seemed to be directly related.\n\nYou can get the original for free from Remedy which runs on Windows (re-released in 2009); I feel that is a better use of your time and money","February 16, 2014","false","1.4"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","31","41","2","0"

What I got was a game almost entirely lacking personality. This new Death Rally is terribly "okay" in everything it does. It gets the job done but is nothing to write home about. If you are okay with "average" then you might enjoy this more than I did.\n\nMy biggest issue isn't so much the actual gameplay but how tame and unexciting it all is - the original was all heavy metal, even letting you compete with some of Apogees / 3D Realms other characters. It had that whole crazy 90ies vibe going on - it was loud, it was frantic and just plain fun.\n\nThe remake is a very different beast -  everything is kind of slow and boring this includes driving at top speed and the firing rate of your mounted machine-guns. You keep unlocking new vehicles and weapons all the time but it doesn't feel like the game's pacing or difficulty really change all that much. There isn't really much happening between your first race and the final races and you can't help but feel like you are wasting your time.\n\nConsidering you can still get the DOS-shareware from 3D Realms old website, I don't really see the point in playing this soulless remake.","November 27, 2013","false","4.0"," 44 of 68 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","44","68","0","0"

So my first experience was a huge dissappointment. My memories with the original one was so fresh, so I couldn't see that this one (although shares the same name) is a different game for a different time.\n\nIn first game your motivation was climbing the ladder to fight with adversary. This game has no ladder, so if you are an old fan, you hate the game from the begining. But this time it is more about cars you have to get ambitious about. Upgrading cars and guns are your main goal in here. Races are faster and harder (in my opinion) than original one. 3 Laps is too short to kill everyone in the game (if you have a new car), so it really takes more dedication to win any race. Graphics are much better than the original one (it has to be after 20 years :) ). Cars are the same (which is a plus :) ) with cool upgrades.\n\nOf course  the game has its downs. Like story is not going to get you. Races are too fast. Race ends till you get the idea most of the time. Gameplay is not very smooth. Enemy AI is not very bright.\n\nBut, in the end, you should see this game as a casual game as it is an adaptation from mobile game. So if you take games too serious it is not a game for you. But if you wanna open a game, make a few race, collect some stuff in your free time, this is right game for you. 9.99$ is a little expensive for the experience, so if you catch a sale (2.99 or less is ideal I think, but 4.99 is not bad too) don't miss it..\n--\nPS: If developer reads this; the thing I miss the most from original game is the enemy characters. There are bosses in every race but in the original game as you move up the ladder you fight with harder characters and before adversary you compete with hard characters like duke and sam speed. This time bosses are just normal cars in normal races. If this could be added to game it will be great. (like adding special voice over, small ads for the boss of the game, may be a history and stuff)..

Even though I know I have romantic (sentimental?) feelings toward *that* game I wanted to give a chance to the remake but it was still very, very disappointing.\n\nMaps are redesigned a silly way so they lost their charm (e.g. "shortcuts", "booster areas", etc), as well as "unlocking" new cars, weapons, etc.\nThis game, instead of giving options for the player on how to spend their money, forces one into dumb achievement and 'on the road objects' farming until the nose starts running...\nWhat about the money you earn in the races in the mean time, you ask? Oh, that money? It goes to neverland! YISS, it is lost.\nMoney in this game is nothing you collect or spend. It is just points to fix the car and fill the rest of the bars (armor, etc).\nSo, e.g. want some mines? Good. "Unlock" and "equip" (otherwise it is free), as soon as you unlocked all the dumb stuff before the mine (like "shotgun" as a weapon instead of the auto-gun...).\n\nI am saying all the above by not giving a cent for the game, as it came for free with a game magazine. It is sad. Super sad. Even the "free" version does not worth playing it :/","August 9, 2014","false","0.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hiimsoso/recommended/108700/","hiimsoso","SoSo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hiimsoso/","364 products in account","Haven't played the original Death Rally, but the remake is a good game in its own right. Short, fast paced races, 3 car add-ons, 6 upgradeable weapons, 7 maps, and 8 cars. All in all, a decent bag of fun.\n\nSure enough, it's not a triple-A title, and nowhere near as complex, but it can be fun. The short races mean you can play a race or two whenever you have a minute and get back to whatever you were doing. Gets even more fun with a few buddies in online[1] play.\n\nGameplay in Death Rally doesn't offer anything brand new, but gets the basics right. Controlling the car is simple, either via a single stick or wasd, and there doesn't seem to be any problems with responsiveness[2]. Steering does take a bit of getting used to, but in the end is not much different from other console-like top-down racers - after a few races it should feel natural. Main gun auto-fires at any targets dead ahead and within range, and secondary guns/mines/nitro are activated by pressing the corresponding buttons.\n\nThe visuals in Death Rally are quite pleasing to the eye. Race tracks and cars look good and offer a lot of detail. The garage view (main menu) shows a nicely-rendered model of the curently selected car (with any selected add-ons/weapons visible) and the UI is clean and efficient. All the necessary elements are visible on one screen and laid out without making the screen cluttered and messy. The UI is designed to be controller-friendly (looks tablet-friendly too) so race selection and car upgrades are quick and easy.\n\nAI opponents do offer a fair challenge, but that's mostly beacuse they tend to drive slightly better cars. The regular mob racers have decent "driving skills" and their cars are slighlty better upgraded, but only up to what's achievable by players. "Boss" racers (of which there is up to one per race), on the other hand, tend to drive real well and their cars are often better than anything the player can achieve. While this does make the game more challenging early on it just breaks it in the very late-game -- most bosses will just speed away right from the start, and only generous amounts of nitro (in-race pickups, random chance) can help catch up. The worst example of this is the "finall boss" - the Adversary - who can't be beat without constant use of nitro, or a lot of ammo pickups.\n\nFor the above reason, among others, Death Rally suffers in terms of replayability. Starting the campaign from scratch does not offer anything new, and will in fact play out nearly the same anyway (up to choice of stages). Playing a single campaign is a much better option, especially in small doses. A few races a day can offer a lot of fun and will delay the somewhat broken end-game long enough to diminish its impact.\n\nThe soundtrack is a good enough generic composition, fits well and doesn't get too annoying or repetitive. Sound effects are good too.","June 16, 2014","true","18.1"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

As soon as it comes down to the controls you might find yourself a bit lost. Not in the way of not knowing what button to press, bt more like "Am I this stupid or is the game so sensible?"\nAnd to be honest, you won't get an answer.\nSure, you need to develop some bit of a "skill" to operate your vehicle of doom delivery, but you'll never end up with a ride that satisfies your control needs for a full 100% Maybe it's a design choice, maybe it's lack of understanding or interest concerning tuning final gameplay.\nAnother thing is the actual upgrade and rank gaining feature.

Seeing Remedy Entertainment mentioned as both a co-developer and publisher for this title my hopes that it would capture the magic of the old title were pretty high. But within no-time this game managed to squash all that.\n\nControls are just an awkward mess. I played mostly with controller, where the car follows the direction of your left stick based on your overview perspective, rather than allowing you to control throttle with a button and steering with the left stick relative to the car. Sadly, it doesn't get all that much better with a keyboard.\nAll cars have a tendency to feel like a stick of soap on a wet bathroom floor. You want to go round a corner? Nope, the car is going to stop in its tracks first, then go for a big half circle in the other direction, before turning the direction you want, as if to underline that this is not a racing game. No, this is a shooting game, with cars.\n\nSadly, when it comes to shooting there isn't much fun to be had. The standard weapon is controlled by the player, only so long as you don't have a secondary gun, at which point it starts shooting on its own (why? Not a clue!). While most secondary guns at least look nice, they are not very effective (nor is the standard weapon, to be honest). Sadly, you get nothing more for fighting off opponents that are behind you than 3 mines - per race. Those 3 mines by themselves are, however, only capable of dealing enough damage to take out 1 enemy entirely. Unless he upgraded his armor. So in other words: in order to get rid of opponents there is nothing for it but to drop back and shoot them from behind. Even though you actually should want to be in the front in order to actually - oh, I don't know - win the race.\n\nUpgrading your cars, weaponry and obtaining new cars is no longer done by saving up and spending money. Money has to be spent immediately after a race in its entirety on upgrades, or more precisely: towards upgrades, as you probably cannot afford it in 1 go (again: why? Not a clue!). New cars and weapons can only be obtained by collecting parts, by shooting down opponents. Yet another reason not to make an effort to win a race, but rather to fight your opponents.\n\nIt's almost as if the developers sat around the office challenging each other to come up with gameplay elements that did not benefit the game. In actual fact, I hope they did, because then at least they would have had more fun making it than I did playing it.","December 9, 2014","false","4.0"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

It was a game that defined my childhood and gave me a lifelong love for automotive combat. High-speed racing, deadly weaponry, awesome music and clear goal- to overcome the demon king of the race, the Adversary. This new incarnation brings all that and more, now featuring cooperative multiplayer and many minor tweaks the orignal lacked, given the hardware limitations of the time. This is the kind of game we could use more of in these troubled times- a game about pure, unadulterated fun. Listen to the Captain,  racer boy. Things can get out of hand real fast out there. Now ride your machine, your motor-war-chariot. Hear it's sublime roar. Strap it, fuel up, reload, and ride out. It's time for death in the fast lane. It's time to race.

Or sometimes you.\n\nCon\n- "Meh" voice acting.  Blame "Tex".\n- Weapons and vehicles unlocked through picking up parts.\n- Can't save money between races.\n- Some races inherently unfair.\n- Pick-ups during races come in sometimes hard to destroy boxes.  This is due to a poor design of the main weapon that "autofires" when it sees fit.\n- Randomness of pick-ups makes it easy to win some races, and frustrating to win others.\n- Unless you have a lot of armour and/or a really fast vehicle you probably don't want to be in front of anyone at the start of a race.  Only mines fire to the rear and you only get 3 - and they never replenish during a race.\n\nAn ok top down racer with an extremely limited number of tracks and a rather dull story.  But the game's not about the story as much as the race and at least most of the actual racing was fairly fun.\n\nBy the end of the game you'll be sick of driving the same tracks over and over and over.  I was also very tired of whatever Tex mumbles.  Tex looks like an oversized George Lucas, by the way.\n\nGraphics are good, clean, and the vehicles and scenery look pretty good.  The cars are responsive, especially if you work on the handling stat, and there are a number of extra weapons you can eventually unlock, level up and use - but only one "special" at a time.  Some are way, way better than others.  The shotgun I found to be almost useless, for example, while the rocket at level 1 was far better than a level 9 shotgun.  Unlock cars and weapons by picking up parts during races.\n\nThe "shadow man" shows up once in a while (via phone call) to offer you advangtages on a per-race basis for a cut of your profits.\n\nThe end race against The Stig .. er I mean The Adversary ... was annoying and completely luck based for me.  I'd have lost again if it wasn't for lucky nitrous drops at the right times, and a lucky bump that sent The Adversary into the wall just before my last nitro kick to the finish line.\n\nThis game os a 6/10 as it is.  MAYBE a 7/10 if you really like this genre - and I mean *REALLY* like, as I like it but not enough to be generous and give it more than 60%.  Still, gotta recommend it as it's not terrible.\n\nIt could have been better with the simple addition of longer, better tracks to race on.  I didn't find driving the tracks in reverse to be much good for variety, although they do feel different in reverse.  I don't mean longer as in more laps like the 42 lap marathon race without weapons - I mean slightly larger tracks.  Some of them are so compact that you're at the final lap (Note that the final lap is usually the 3d, sometimes you're in a one lap race so that's SUPER short) before you've played much more than 70 seconds.  Yup.  70.  Seconds.  Some one lap races last  20 to 25 seconds or so.  Yup, takes longer to spend your earnings.\n\nWith better design decisions this could have been a 10/10 for sure.  I'd pay for a simlar game that has no instant repair or ammo pick-ups during the race.  It could have stats that can be improved for the driver and vehicles that are upgraded with parts you purchase with cash from your winnings.   You could unlock different parts by making contacts or spending cash.  Make it roguelike with perma-death *IF* you actually die when the vehicle is disabled and it would be even better.  Improved ranking system, multiple places to race, larger vehicle selection, ability to mount weapons facing EITHER DIRECTION... *sigh*.  I'll shut up now, y'all know what I want.","December 6, 2014","true","10.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I picked it up on sale for $3.50 and it’s proven to be a good value for the money. The mechanics are absurdly straightforward, the story is so shallow that it borders on pointless, and yet the upgrade system redeems this arcade racer and turns it from something tedious to something genuinely fun and engaging.\n\nThe story, such as it is, is that a Joe Arpaio-type sheriff arrests the player, a young punk, for some driving-related mischief and, rather than putting him in a pink dress and sending him to pick up trash along the highway like any normal insane Arizona law-enforcement official, he recruits the maverick to challenge other ne’er-do-wells to deadly races in hopes of luring an archcriminal known as The Adversary out of hiding so that he may be captured or killed. That’s basically it. The story plays out through a total of three cutscenes interspersed among the story missions, which are unlocked as your fame level or upgrades are purchased.\n\nNon-story gameplay consists of selecting from among a group of seven randomly-chosen tracks/difficulty levels or playing a challenge mode race, which generally has a specific objective or vehicle/weapon loadout. If you don’t like the options provided, you can always click the “story” button twice and the computer will present you with a new batch (I personally preferred the “Pit” track because it’s the least twisty and I’m not very good at these kinds of games).\n\nWinning or losing races will grant you varying levels of financial rewards which are used to purchase upgrades. There are six primary weapons to unlock and select from (not counting mines) and each vehicle has three characteristics to enhance (speed, handling, and armor). You get more money for killing your opponents or placing better than sixth (each race features five AI opponents).\n\nGraphics are about what you’d expect from a top-down racer in 2012, neither spectacular nor underwhelming. Sound effects are serviceable and the cutscene voice-acting is atrocious (on purpose, I suspect). The music is limited to what you hear in the main menu, apart from one Poets of the Fall track that plays over the end credits (Remedy must have a long-term licensing deal with that band, as their music was all over the Alan Wake games).\n\nThe game is not without its quirks. It will not load in fullscreen by default at your computer’s native resolution, which means you have to take the following steps to resolve this: go to the Settings menu, change the resolution to something lower-than-native, click the “Windowed” button to “No”, and then change the resolution to native. This would be a very trivial point if the game remembered your settings between sessions but it doesn’t, so you’ll be doing this every time you load the game. Your alternative is to play in a window but I wouldn’t recommend it; given the amount of frantic clicking that the gameplay demands, you will inevitably click outside of the window, thereby losing the race for yourself and after you do this a few times, you’ll give up and resign yourself to the above process. The PC controls for the mouse and keyboard work but they’re not great; as with most racing games you’ll want to use a controller and you’re best off with an XBOX controller (unless you enjoy fiddling with things like MotioninJoy). As with many PC games, the controller configuration is very limited and it doesn’t work very well at all with my Logitech Rumblepad 2, although I can generally get the Rumblepad to play well with other racers like Burnout Paradise.\n\nOn the whole, though, it’s curiously satisfying to upgrade your vehicles and weaponry and kick ♥♥♥ in random races, which is the essence of this game. I put 13 hours into it, beating the story mode (that Adversary is a tough nut to crack) and getting most (84%) of the achievements in the process; you may get some extra value out of it if you enjoy competitive online multiplayer modes but these generally aren’t my bag. I can say it’s well worth buying, especially if you nab it during a decent sale.","April 9, 2014","true","13.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The depth of story and mechanics lacks short and if you though racing was about winning... Well in Death Rally it's all about staying behind and killing people to get parts to the next car.\n\nThere is no actual difficulty settings, as you can get in trouble by the first tier of vehicles when you already have a fully upgraded top car. Killing cars is also a bit more annoying as you never know for sure how long will it take to finish one off.\n\nGame is indeed fun an all, but lacks emotion when comes to important aspects.

However, the version sold in steam is not the original version, but more of a re-imagination or a remake of it. It stays the same on some parts, improves visuals and such, but loses a bit of the feel that original held.\n\nWhile I rate the original Death Rally better than this one, the new version is definitely worth a play, both for fans of the original and those who haven't played Death Rally before. It's addictive and fun, and you don't need to win every race to advance, making the experience more fun and smooth than frustrating, yet being enough challenging.

On the one hand its alot of fun to race and blow all your opponents up but on the other hand it can get frustrating to get shot at all the time. I have really enjoyed this game from start to finish even though some of the achievements are nuts and hard to get. The thing that was frustrating for me was the game never fully going in to full screen mode. The option is there but it would never do it for me. The gamemodes can get repetitive at times if you are trying to grind away at kills and other things. The nice thing about all the achievements is that you don't need to play against a live human to get some of them. The "Online" play can be done with bots, and the achievements for "Online" can be done just like if you were playing against the computer. The cars can be customize which is a nice feature to have. The controls can feel crazy at first but with some practice you can get really good at fully controlling the car. If you like a full on shooter/racer game then this is the game to get. I mainly got it because I thought the achievements would be easy to get and for the most part they were, but some you will need alot of patience to get. I would say get it but make sure you get it while its on sale, then you will feel like you got your monies worth.","November 14, 2012","true","25.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

It's obvious that this game was first released on iOS and you can clearly see that the developers did NOT bother to increase the detail on the models (textures might have been improved, hard to tell, but the polygon count is very visibly low). Cars like the Deliverator definitely don't look as cool as they used to in the original, but that's subjective I guess.\n\nMusic and sound effects are bare minimum. Music was never a strong point of Death Rally so I'm not too bothered by the rather generic, boring and colorless rock tracks they put into this new version. The sound effects are okay, nothing to criticize too much here.\n\nThe biggest issue, to me, is the way they changed the in-game economy (ie. the shops - everything you did between races). In the original DOS game, you had the (legal) shop and the (illegal) black market. You had money and you would make important decisions what upgrade or car to save money for. This was a big part of playing the game and the separation between the clean shop and the dirty blackmarket (where you'd get all the good, ie. illegal, stuff) also added a very nice and grimy aspect to the game. Well, they removed ALL of this in the 2012 release. Now you don't even really have money anymore. Sure, you collect dollars but then, all they do, is fill up 'upgrade bars'. It was amazing to be able to safe cash to finally get to buy that amazing and mysterious Deliverator in the original - now cars don't even cost money anymore! You just unlock them by collecting parts on the race track! Now you just click on the armor, handling or speed bar and it fills it up automatically with your money. That's it.\n\nThe fact that they completely omitted the black market is also indicative of another change they made: the atmosphere, the vibe of the game, is now very typically iOS orientated. This new game is almost family-friendly while the old one was dark and, well, just plain cool. The writing used to be excellent, in my opinion, really putting you into that oil-stained illegal street-racing, loan-sharking, drug-collecting world. The new version you're buying here is bland and clean, almost sterile. The writing is bad (literally: there's a lot of typos and language errors in the game) and colorless. Even the interface is generic in its 'brushed metal' look.\n\nAnother annoyance is the length of the races. Once again, there's the iOS influence. The race length is between 30 and 50 secs average. It's often times NOT enough to kill opponents and it's definitely never enough to actually get 'into' a race. This is clearly designed to be played on mobile Apple devices on breaks, in the bus or on the train.\n\nThere's definitely more issues that set this 2012 version behind the original DOS release but those are the main points of frustration to me. However, as I said above, after all's been said and done, this is STILL enjoyable. The actual gameplay is, despite some flaws, still the same good old top-down driving, shooting and killing fun. I bought this on sale for less than two Euros and, for that price, it's a no-brainer must-buy, no question, I would however regret my purchase had I payed full price for it.","November 27, 2013","true","8.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The arcadey driving is overly simple with hand-cramping controls that lack finesse required in good racing games – even arcade racing games. The RPG element is weak but somewhat addictive. The multiplayer is basically uninhabited and limited to random online-only matches; sorry, no beer-fueled buddy matches. The story is trite and drawn out via ridiculous story-mission level requirements. The only reason I put as much time into this game is because of nostalgia, since Death Rally’s gameplay was 100% lifted from the NES classic R.C. Pro-Am.

This attempt at a reboot is horrendous! There's too much emphasis on power sliding (even with handling maxed out), and the enemy's stats scale with difficulty. The original was great because the progression was consistent and you struggled to break the power curve, the point at which you become a serious contender. There are 3 things I absolutely loathe about this one: Poor handling, poor progression, and ridiculous "hidden" enemy HP. In the original, as soon as the life meter ran out, cars blew up. Here, they enter a "red, flashing danger" mode and continue to take extra hits before getting knocked out. This puts the emphasis more on the racing, while the original gave you total freedom.

It remains to this day one of the best arcade racing games ever made, right up there with F-Zero. The controls were precise, from the art of cornering with bad tires to the science of cutting the shortest distances on the track. The cars were distinguishable; while it was just a system of upgrading from worst to best, it made sense for the goal at hand and always kept the challenge fresh. It was a game that worked through the limitations of the age.\n\nThis remake, however, is abominable. The controls are bad, the camera angle is worthless and removes one of the core elements of the original (namely the top-down perspective), and the cars all feel the same.

You aim with a mouse. You shoot cars. You race cars.\nTheir pixelated corpses fly comically through the air.\nSometimes the cars are close. Sometimes they’re far away.\n\nThis isn’t racing, but mental exercises in learning to keep a floaty polygon block (referred to in the game as a “car”) on a flat and blurry texture map (or “track”) long enough to reach the first curve.\nAt which point, the oversensitive controls, nonexistent physics and spotty collision detection will invariably send your polygon block lurching wildly into the fuzzy green texture sometimes known as “grass.” Start over.\n\n“Stay one step ahead of the law”? The game didn’t ship with police included.\n“Race your modified car”? It also forgot to ship with actual racing opponents.\n“5 different tracks”? When you try to load the fifth, the game crashes…\n“Non-stop driving”? Sometimes, when starting a race, the outstanding game engine believes you’ve finished and rewards you with a congratulatory screen after five seconds. Genius!\n\nFailure and embarrassment. From a player’s perspective, Death Rally is an absolute mess.\nThe controls suck. The graphics suck. The music sucks. The multiplayer sucks.\nTake whatever expectations you’d usually have for a piece of advertising for a Shovel and lower them by a few hundred percent.

It doesn’t work [but] there’s a multiplayer button on the main menu.\nOne being…that you can quit at anytime. No, wait you can’t. In fact, Death Rally crashes your computer everytime you try to quit.\n\nTo be fair, there was a comic book… created by the same people as the game, though, and published before the game’s release as obvious promotional material.\nThe comic book contained +18 scenes.\nClearly, the designers were too focused on the comic book than on proper programming.\nBut hey!\nThe programmers used only their left hand to create the game, what'd you expect?\n\n-Miyuki 2015","August 10, 2014","false","5.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","4"

Following the story and having finished the available missions I would think that more tracks/missions would unlock. But that was not the case. There are about 8 tracks, and they are randomized every time you have played a level. The tracks remain the same, the objectives change from time to time though. These objectives range from killing certain boss enemies, racing a few laps, killing everyone in some sort of arena, etc. With the money you make you can upgrade your vehicle and weapons. During races you'll collect random parts of vehicles and weapons as well, and killing enemies always grants a certain part.\nBut... the game is just so dull. You can tell it was meant for smaller devices. The graphics have been upgraded though, and other control schemes have been implemented as well, so it is a game worth having; just not for the full price.\n\n[Rating: 57/100]","August 12, 2012","false","3.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","2"

I kept trying to get into the game, but at the $5 or so I paid for it I don't want to spend any more time with it.\n\nThe graphics are nice, and the explosions are fun.

I didn't like how you had to collect different resources for different unlocks, because that removes your choice in favour of a (sort-of, but relatively even) random element. I didn't like that nitro cannot be bought before a race (I'm not really sure if it was like that back in the old days though). This particular design decision turned me away in the end: you have no way of preparing for the last match, it all depends on your luck of finding nitro/ammo in the boxes.\n\nIn the end, it was fun, but come to think of it, I didn't really enjoy the races either, I only did them to progress with the cars and upgrades...

Yes, it's fun in an old school mindless fashion with your little car racing around small repetitive tracks but due to the mechanics and swimmy control input you can't really "race" in any proper fashion so killing the competition is the only choice to get ahead.  Frankly, the controls are weak even when using the must-have gamepad controller.  You're never seriously penalized for coming in second or even last place, you just get less money awarded to you for the purchase of upgrades to your guns and car performance, and you can't carry the money over between rounds to help in purchasing the pricier goodies.  Sadly even when you do upgrade the results don't feel like a significant improvement.  Graphics are passable while the sound quality is merely functional; neither have flair or panache.  The game tries to create some personality in certain key opponents you face off against but they come off as cookie-cutter archetypes and pose little more challenge than the basic racers which ends up making them boring.  Boring and uninspired gameplay is really the biggest drawback to this game.  I played for 3 hours total and during that time I was able to fully upgrade 4 cars and the gatling gun weapon and once I got to that level I realized I wasn't have any fun and none of the other upgrade levels were going to get any more compelling and I called it quits.  Death Rally was a fun diversion but completely forgettable and only worth playing during a free weekend.  Save your time and money and go buy Renegade Ops instead as that game handles this approach to automotive combat a thousand times better.","January 24, 2014","false","3.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

There's a really simple driving model, and everything is based on grinding. Unlocking new cars, new weapons, new tracks, new upgrade levels, -new story missions-, it's all  running races for money and unlock chits from blowing your opponents up.\nHowever! It's really stupidly fun, even when you can't drive for beans and never place well. The tracks are short enough that you can run a few laps in a few minutes, making it easy to pick up and put down when you've got a few minutes to (ahem) kill. Races with special conditions, and requests for bribes to sabotage opponents and sneak peeks of later weapons help to shake things up, though they're definitely uncommon.","August 6, 2012","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just like back in the day, it combines high quality graphics (genre considered) with fluid gameplay and a simple reward system that makes it oh so easy to hop in just for a few more rounds!\n\nThe only critique I have is for the menu system. For some reason I keep finding it behaving just a bit different to what I would expect. It is a small thing, and does not interfere with gameplay, but the UX design has not quite hit it's mark there.","February 26","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Drive, kill everyone or win the race.\n\nIt is not a top game. Just a pastime. Something to play when you want to destroy something or when you only have 30 minutes before leaving the computer.\n\nI recommend getting the discounted price, since this game has been sold for only 1USD.","March 6","true","14.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Awful.\n\nI got this game thinking, 'how bad can it be?' I loved the original Death Rally game I thought this would give me some nice nostalgia. Well this game isn't hardly nostalgic at all. The vehicles are wayyyy too hard to control. I know it gets easier as you upgrade them but the music is so bad and generic that I wonder why I would want to. This game is also extremely hard and I don't see why I should play this when there are so many other (and better) games to play.","February 6","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No real consequence for loosing many races in a row.\n- No challenges and almost no reason to actually win races (we found that its more benefitial to just stay back, shoot and collect stuff)\n- Too easy to win (if you want to win), even on the icy track\n- Basically just a grinding game, but with little reward\n- Weird multiplayer at best (played with a friend; often we would get different races/disconnects; there wasn't any lobby or ready check to make sure we both are in the same race and ready to race)\n- No online competition when playing with friends, it seems\n- It's tagged as Co-op, but we didn't find a way to play cooperatively anywhere\n- I couldn't change the controls for some reason\n\nVERDICT:\nA simple casual racing game. It would be good for kids, if there wasn't so much shooting in it. To appropriate audiences however, it offers no excitement a no real sense of reward or incentive to keep playing, even though there is some stuff to unlock. If you remember the 1996 Death Rally, and feel nostalgic, play the original. If you want some wacky racing fun with friends, look elsewhere.\n\nIn the screenshots and the video, the game looked like it lives up to the legacy, it promised fast paced, on the edge racing, filled with adrenalin, excitement and rampage. But sadly, it doesn't deliver. Which is a big shame, it definitely had potential.  Sure, the game was probably ment to be just a mobile app and it might be fun there, but for some serious gaming or even just some multiplayer fun, it is, as Jeremy Clarkson would say, a mild cheddar.","May 8","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So when I got this on a sale price I could not resist getting it. I have not been sorry at all. It is not the exact copy of the original, but it has kept a lot of what made the original a classic. The handling of the cars is not overly difficult, but just so that it is not to easy. I love the fact that you don’t have to be in front to win when your weapons are well upgraded and used in the game. One feature I do miss is how you pick the venue and then you can see who is up to race and then you can decide if you want to race. So if I could ask for one chance that would be it. All and all this is a fun game that can be played over and over again.","June 2","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
