"http://steamcommunity.com/id/electrichellknight/recommended/360760/","electrichellknight","ElectricHellKnight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/electrichellknight/","95 products in account","English review:\n\nI write this review only as a small service. It seems like this game is getting many negative reviews simply because it's in Russian. As a disclaimer, I am American and cannot speak or read Russian. However, this only proves to be an issue when navigating the menus. As for the actual game, as long as you've played a decent number of shooters, it should be fairly straightforward. Anybody with reasonable experience playing shooters should have no problem getting through the tutorial level. WADS moves you, ctrl crouches, left click to shoot, right click to aim, space to jump. How hard is that? There are some interesting wall jumping and quick moving mechanics present and the gameplay feels pretty solid, especially for a free-to-play game. The graphics look dated, but that really is not a big deal. Again, it is free-to-play, what do you expect?\n\nAs for the pay-to-win system, well it doesn't really seem like pay-to-win. I did fine against Russian players who, apart from having the advantage of understanding the whole game, seemed to have purchased better gear than me. Although I did not win, I was not in last place either.\n\nObviously I am not going to be playing this game a lot and I probably will end up uninstalling simply because of the language barrier. But to down-vote a seemingly good game (especially one that is free), just because it is not in your language is just close-minded and stupid. Just because a game is in another language does not mean that it is bad.\n\n\nРусский обзор (предоставляется Google Translate):\n\nЯ пишу этот отзыв только как дополнительный сервис. Похоже, эта игра становится много отрицательных отзывов просто потому, что в русском языке. Как отказ, я американец и не может говорить или читать по-русски. Однако, это только доказывает, чтобы быть проблемой, когда перемещение по меню. Что касается собственно игры, до тех пор, как вы играли в приличное количество стрелков, он должен быть достаточно простым. Любой с разумными опыт игры стрелков не должны иметь никаких проблем с получением через уровень учебник. Пыжи перемещает вас, Ctrl приседает, щелкните левой кнопкой мыши, чтобы стрелять, щелкните правой кнопкой мыши, чтобы прицелиться, пробел, чтобы прыгать. Как трудно это? Есть некоторые интересные прыжки стены и быстро движущиеся механика присутствует и геймплей чувствует себя довольно твердый, особенно для игры бесплатно-игры. Графика выглядит устаревшей, но это действительно не имеет большого значения. Опять же, это бесплатно-игры, что вы ожидаете?\n\nЧто касается системы платного к победе, ну на самом деле не кажется, что платить к победе. Я сделал штрафа в отношении российских игроков, которые, помимо имея преимущество понимания всю игру, казалось, приобрели более передачу, чем мне. Хотя я не выиграл, я не был на последнем месте либо.\n\nОчевидно, что я не собираюсь играть в эту игру много, и я, вероятно, будет в конечном итоге удалить просто из-за языкового барьера. Но вниз голосовать, казалось бы, хорошую игру (особенно тот, который является бесплатным), только потому, что это не в Ваш язык просто закрыть настроенных и глупо. Просто потому, что игра на другом языке, не означает, что это плохо.","January 18","true","0.4"," 117 of 152 people (77%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","77","117","152","17","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Holy_Hobo/recommended/360760/","Holy_Hobo","Holy_Hobo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Holy_Hobo/","10 products in account","(TL:DR at the end)\nFor whatever reason the game only counts you being on it on steam when the loading bar is up. My actual hours are roughly 60.\nAlso, this is mostly describing gameplay. The first two and the last two paragraphs talk about the other aspects you should be aware of, in case you don't wish to read what the game is like.\n\nRun and fire is quite an interesting game, to say the least. The first thing that should be noted, is the download size is not 100 Mb as it says. It is around 4000.\n\nOne of the major turnoffs is that the language is all russian, making the vast majority of players unable to enjoy it. I downloaded google translate on my phone and held the camera up to my screen to navigate through the tutorial and menus, and I still do when new popups come. It obviously has a hard time with the blur from a screen on another screen, and the translations being strange at times, but it got me through and now I don't use it very often, I can buy gear, change my loadout, go into matches etc. without needing it too often.\n\nAs for the game details, Yes it is another fps. The graphics are very pretty, and runs extremely well, even on a potato for a computer. It should be noted that I use a game boosting software, but I average roughly 40-50 frames solid, and believe me this is NOT a gaming computer.\n\nGameplay, is pretty standard for most fps. Automatic weapons dominate as with all shooters, though for some reason a lot less than most other games. There is no ADS on weapons unless you specifically put one on using the ingame currency(The game uses a time system for almost all purchases, I will get more into it later) or snipers, I have little experience with them but it seems that the "hipfire" is quite accurate anyways, the recoil can be a problem however.\n\nThere are three classes in the game, engineer(at least that's what google translate said) assault, and marksman.\nEngineer wields shotguns, assault...automatic weapons, and marksman-sniper rifles. Each can have a secondary pistol, they all share the same, except marksman for whatever reason has a few extras.  They each have an ability, though I've only used sniper's extensively, engineer has a boost jump in a direction, assault can rush forward, and sniper can go invisible for a few seconds, however without weapons, and the animations for going in and coming out of invisibility can get you killed. When you kill an enemy they drop whatever weapon they were wielding at the time, as well as an orb which you can pick up to resupply your ability, which can only be used so many times/for so long.\n\nIt is worth noting that against any solid surface, you can jump twice. Also, firing a shot while jumping will make the bullet come out of where you were before jumping. It can be quite annoying when jumping over a box to snipe someone.\n\nUnfortunately, this is one of those games where bunny hopping, and bolt action canceling are a thing, however you can do just fine against those players if you are tactical enough. The last thing to note is that grenades have a very short fuse, it can be extremely irritating when people throw the one or two they have into a vent when they have the chance, it is quite hard to run away and sometimes even when you are far enough away(roughly 7 meters or more) they still kill/damage you.\n\nThere is a second gamemode(as far as I'm aware, the only other major one. I believe there is a last man standing type, and others, but team deathmatch and the one I'm about to discuss are the ones worth noting.)\n\nThe gamemode uses different maps than the normal modes, and starts off with players choosing a class and hiding.\nAfter around 5 or 6 seconds, one random player turns into a "zombie", and gets a green tinted screen, 4K health, the ability of the engineer and can walljump like normal. Primary attack(1) is swiping, and secondary attack(2) is throwing a green orb, affected by gravity. The orb lags quite a bit(Which I will also cover later), and should only be used on stationary targets. His goal is to find the players and kill them. As a human, you can find a minigun around the map, which is extremely effective against the zombies, perhaps a little too effective. It can stun lock and deals insane DPS.\nOnce the zombie kills a player, they turn as well, except they have 600 health, can't secondary attack and instead of the engineer ability, they get the assault ability.\n\nThere is some measures of server lag in the game. It is quite unnoticeable for most players, specifically automatics and shotguns, but it sometimes makes sniping quite annoying. I presume it is because of russian hosted servers, But I'm not sure. It affects other aspects of the game, I think the zombie green orb is because of this. However, it is hardly noticable for the most part, and really isn't much of a downside.\n\nThere is a soft currency, and a premium currency. If you do well in a match, there will be a box icon at the top of the screen. click it, then click the lower right button of the popup that comes up and you will recieve the money. It isn't too hard to come by. Some gear can only be purchased with premium gear, but almost everything is cosmetic, and the only gear that can be bought by it is pretty much for the skin, the stats offer no advantage whatsoever.\nHOWEVER. As said before, it does use a time system. pretty much 70% of things in the store have a time on them. It isn't too bad, since you can buy one day on a weapon, and just casual playing will almost always will give you profit. You do start with a hefty amount of it, enough to buy a weapon permanant(Only weapons can be bought permanant.)\nUsually that makes up for the time model in my book, but once you buy something permanant. it then comes with durability. After you use it for a while, it goes down(can be checked on in the inventory tab)and requires a pretty penny to repair. Honestly, I would say it is better to just buy for a day at a time.  Maybe if the other options give more of a deal, then buy them.\n\n\n\nTL:DR-\n\nI know I've mostly critisized the game(And sorry about talking about the gameplay mostly, I got carrie away), but it is hard to talk about good things with an fps. not because they don't have any, but because there are so many of them. However it does have it's own take on the genre, a take which is quite enjoyable. Do I recommend this game? Yes, though definitely have google translate on your phone at the ready, and be wary of the currency system.","August 3, 2015","true","0.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This game has cool tricks too like dashing, charged jumping and wall-running. How? Either double-tap your move controls or your spacebar, depends on your class.

Even without being able to read a lick of Russian, I was able to create an account, get into a server, compare gun stats, buy a gun and accessories, and start a match.\n\nAnyone who gives this a negative review because of the game being in Russian probably should have read some reviews or maybe checked the language compatability before downloading.\n\nThis is a very fun game. The shooting mechanics are well done, and that's something that F2P shooters screw up a lot. Your gun doesn't jump violently every shot as it would in real life, but you still need to burst fire to hit anything at range. Not entirely realisitc, but who cares, it's a game.\n\nThis game will most likely die just like it did before, but I intend on enjoying it while it lasts. Repulse was fun as hell and I'm glad to see it back, even if it is in Russian.","June 30, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

It works exactly like any other FPS game and has an odd resemblance to CS 1.6. Dev team, this game will probably get better reviews and more players if you add English. It's not hard to get the basics of it though, even if it's Russian. If you honestly can't work your way out just because it's a different language, you're an idiot. Many russian words are similar to English. Energy in Russian is pronounced almost the exact same way it is in English, for example. I'll give this game a 10/10, simply because I haven't encountered any bugs, and the community isn't salty.","September 3, 2015","true","1.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"
