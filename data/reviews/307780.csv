I've spent at least 200€ for Kollector's Edition plus extra copies for friends. I've bared with them for months since the game's release in April, all this time hoping they would eventually fix the game and bring us at least the same experience console gamers always had from day one, like promised by Ed Boon himself prior to release. After quite some months that finally happened - with exception of online netcode, which remained broken on consoles also, and fans like myself started to see and expect much brighter future for this game with announcements of KP2, and ESPECIALLY new - improved online netcode, also known as "GGPO".\n\nInstead I heard the news today that neither KP2 nor "GGPO" will be available on PC, basically they admitted to abandoning the game on PC alltogether.  I'll still keep playing the game because it's perfectly playable as of now (minus horrible online experience). But what they did here is still the perfect example of everything wrong with modern gaming industry. Take costumer's money and abandon the ship when maintaining becomes to taxing and not profitable enough. It seems WB learned nothing from Batman Arkham Knight fiasco also.\n\nI decided to never pay full price for anything from WB and NRS again, if I ever buy something from them again, I'll make sure I pay as little as possible. In addition I'm never preordering any game again period, I finally learned my lesson so at least thanks for that WB/NRS. I'm trying to use all possible channels to spread the word, because this is way bigger than just Mortal Kombat X. People have to understand this is not just about MK series. Like I said before, WB is pure cancer for the entire industry. WB (along with some other companies) represents everything wrong with gaming industry in recent years. WB is the devil form Neather Realm, a money grabbing demon. Please don't feed the demon.

That being said, the pricing model of this game is atrocious.  There are decisions I agree with - for example, offering to allow players to spend money to unlock all Krypt items.  Not everyone enjoys unlocking.  The biggest ones I disagree with are the way the characters are sold.  It's almost like the game wants to be a F2P with microtransactions, except that it's not F2P because you have to drop $60 to get in the door.  The Kombat Pack kind of sort of is like a Season Pass, except it isn't because it leaves out Goro.  So you've gotta drop your $60 for the game, another $30 for the Kombat Pack, and on top of that you also have to buy Goro.  I'm assuming that if they release any more characters, you'll have to buy them as well.  Unacceptable business practice in my opinion.  Either make the game free to play and then nickle and dime players for specific content, or put a price sticker on all of the content that we pay up front and then give us the content.  For this reason, I am going to have to say not recommending this game.  It's a shame too, because it's otherwise a fantastic game.  But I refuse to support this kind of greed.","December 20, 2015","false","27.9"," 957 of 1,065 people (90%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","90","957","1","27","16"

But instead of buying it through Steam, PLEASE go to sites such as G-2A, K-inguin, CDKeys where you can get the game for 8€ with KP1. The reason of this is so this f-cking scums companies NRS and WB don't get a f-cking penny for f-cking with us.\n\nThe thing is that they launch the game full of bugs and being so unplayable so everyone who bought the game in the early months dropped it. Later on the game got patched and it started to have the same XB1 experience or even better. If there isn't a big playerbase it's because of their fault and for releasing such a bad port.

Edit: 20. Jan. 2016 After a completely botched launch with all it's problems and months to fix them, MKX is apparently abandoned by NRS/WB. This means no further support in the form of balance patches, new dlc characters, netcode improvements whatsoever. Never buying a  game that is developed by NRS or published by WB again.\n\nhttp://testyourmight.com/threads/future-of-mkx-on-pc-kp2-mkxl-confirmed-console-only.58181/page-7#post-1999319\n\nAlso, how convenient to announce this AFTER the christmas sale. Squeeze the last few sales out of it and then bounce... well played to the people responsible. No effin shame, have you?\n\n1. Edit: 02. Oct. 2015 The most recent patches added a benchmark to this game whose rating will be displayed in online sessions. Point 3) is only partly a factor. Took them only 6 months, gg. However most other problems stick, so overall it doesn't change much.\n\nDon't buy this game if you plan to play this game online. I've played my fair share of fighting games (Blazblue, SF4, DoA4, SFxT, Tekken, classics on fightcade/GGPO) and this game has by far the worst online I've ever seen. The matchmaking is absolutely horrbile, because all you get is a "green bar".  I'm using quotation marks because the game is apparently as tolerant as it gets when it comes to these bars. Most green bar machtes play like underwater, 1.5-2 seconds of delay isn't uncommon, in fact it's completely normal.\n\n1) There is no ping.\n\n2) There isn't even a country flag, you wont know when you're up against some mud hut dweller who uses a water wheel for internet. This is complicated by the high threshold for "green bar connections" which makes them rather deceptive.\n\n3) There is no benchmark rating like in USF, you wont know if you're matched against somebody with a potato pc or not, running the game below 60fps. Edit: We have a benchmark rating now, but it's semi worthless if you can't filter bad ratings out. The playerbase is very low due to a rough launch - think Arkham Knight bad. You can now decline those kinda players, but you will consistently get matched up with them, so you spend more time declining their sorry asses than playing the game.\n\nJust to give you an example, the game matched me up with 20 different opponents, and a whopping 16/20 didn't pass the benchmark. I got 5 solid matches in 60 mins which is pathetic for a game barely 6 months old. 60 mins of online matchmaking in USF4 equals 25-35 matches.\n\nOnline just isn't fun and a total crap shoot. It takes ages to find matches and when you find them, there's still a decent chance that they wont be enjoyable. It's just not worth the hassle.\n\nIf you can get the game for cheap the offline content may be worth it, it certainly isn't worth the steam price, because fighting against the AI gets stale pretty quick. The story is about 6 hours depending on how well you do. You get your run of the mill single player modes like classic tower, survivor, endless etc. where you can grind koins to unlock new brutalities, fatalities, fan art and so on. The AI is also your typical fighting game AI, training dummy on lower difficulties, but reading your inputs on higher difficulties. You wont learn much fighting against the AI as is with most other fighting games.\n\nThe game isn't bad, it's probably a good entry game for beginners who are looking to get into fighting games. The execution barrier is quite low and the mechanics are rather simple, at least compared to most other fighting games like Blazblue, Guilty Gear (game mechanics) or even Street Fighter (option selects). But the online is balls, and that's where you put your training to a test (or not), so unless you're fortunate enough to have an offline scene... pass up on this.","September 6, 2015","false","22.6"," 178 of 197 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","178","197","8","3"

Sure, we messed up many, many times over with various releases, but something was still wrong! In the past, we'd tried to correct our mistakes... well, it just didn't feel right. It's 2016 now, and something had to change. So this year, we've pulled out a special new year treat for you all, by abandoning Mortal Kombat X completely! This way, we can really show you what scum we think you are, for buying our products.

While the game's release wasn't a travesty as large as Arkham Knight's, it did continue to have a number of issues ever since day one, a lot of those issues still remain. Now, as of 1/20/2016, NetherRealm Studios has officially ended support for Mortal Kombat X on PC. No netcode improvements which are beyond needed, new content, no nothing. If you're curious at all about this game, look into it on PS4 or XB1 because it's clear that they stopped caring for their PC fanbase.

ED BOON SCREWED US UP. Why? Read below.\n\nOk, now. I am a Bulgarian guy, living in Germany. I waited for a good while for MKX to pop up on 3rd party software companies like bundles, cause steam dooesn't let the Germas buy it, and I finally procured it. So in my good old review fashion, we get to pick the good and the bad. And as of 22.01.16, I will take a look at the terrible before the good.\n\nTHE TERRIBLE:\n\nWhy the hell aren't we getting the extra packs on PC? What did we do to you, Ed Boon? Aren't our money just as good as the people who bought it on consoles? WHAT GIVES?!\n\nThe Good:\n1. Better character skins. Let's face it, MK9 was a muscle/breast overkill.\n2. Great costumes. I loved them.\n3. The arenas ware awesome.\n4. The characters are cannon. Even if we introduce the new gen  (Cassie, Jacqui, Takeda & Kung Jin), we see a ton of characters doing cameos from the mk1-9 series.\n5. The story is good. I disagree that the story could have been better. I loved the story and it kept me on edge.\n6. SO many MK3-9 characters do cameos in this game, be it Kombatable or not. Fujin, Tanya (now playable(, Baraka, Rain, Sareena, Mei Li, the Quan Chi undead Striker - Kabal Army (to elaborate: Smoke, Striker, Kung Lao, Liu Kang, Kitana, Sindel, etc.)?\n7. Variations provide a breath of fresh air to caracters without changing them much. I like that addition, albeit there are variations that beat others.\n8. The Krypt is back from MK9. It is  a game in itself, unless you bought all crypt items DLC.\n9. Everything that MK9 had to offer is in MKX. Don'et ever get this wrong.\n10. The tough bosses are back from MK9 - Corrupted Shinnok spamming his OP attack FTW, Just like Shao Kahn and his spear/hammer.\n11. MP with factions and kills and an ongoing battle.\n12. I have always considered the MK franchise to be the more honorable and the more mature one than Street FIghter 4-5, Dead or Alive 5, etc., with its ature approach to audience through fatalities, brutalities, babalities (not in MKX) and so on.\n13. MP feels good and works good,... When IT WORKS GOOOD!!!\n14. Single Player MKX works well. You get new stuff every day, new towers every day, new challenges every day. Kudos.\n15. I mean it - the game does just as good as it does bad. It is purely subjective. Read through and decide for yourselves.\n16. There are regular patches that relieve the bugs or inbalances that plague the game. That is a good thing,\n17. Towers that refresh every day in comparison the the long running ones.\n\nAnd for me, it ends there. For a PC user that is. And now comes the bad:\n\nFirst and foremost: DLC DLC DLC... WHat the hell ppl? Why turn the only fighting game with no dlc into an DLC paradise??? What's next? Bikini Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, D`Vorah, Tanya?\n1. Skins must have been into the game, like MK9. MKX seems like a downgrade in that respect.  This pertains to 2, as I dearly miss my Skarlet. I bought the hole package on my trip to... (cry)... why!!! It was a good vacation! I know I cant buy MK9 in Germany!!! You maniacs!!! YOu blew it up!!! Damn YOU!!!\n2. DLCs plague the game unlike MK9. NO Goro, Tanya, Predator, Tremor, Jason Voorhees, etc.unless you pay up. Good job ppl.\n3. Cross platform MP is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I played like 20 matches, and 8 of them were laggy. LIke 6 FPS laggy.\n4. I played 20 matches and 90% of those were vs enemies of skill 50+ vs a new player that starts the game. A newbie dies immediately to them. I won a few with Cassie and took a few rounds off the big guys, to my pleasure. I loved that, and I dont regret my losses. THat felt GOOD. So it might add to the good batch of experiences, right?\n5. I had tons of cross-pc and cross-platform lag. Stilll. I had battles that ran at 5 frames per second - weirdly enough, I enjoyed those, because, after round 1, I knew that I can slow mo my attacks, and be on par with a 65 skill guy. I still lost though. 65 vs 24 beginner? You do the math.\n6. The whole faction stuff feels half bait. I know I would soon switch to the Black Dragon because they win and I want my stuff because I bought the game!!!\n7. Lag in online games is still there.\n8. "Get GOOD" is an issue. Yes you need to get good. Or you lose.\n9. Where is my 300 challenge tower? Why is it changed to daily towers that do the same thing over and over again?\n10. If you are a casual player, the game peters off way too quickly into the "let it be played into the tournament circle". MK9 is still better in that respect.\n11. The variaions are subpar. Better ones still beat poorer ones.\n12... Now hold on to your knickers if you have a short fuse.\n- unless you "get good" you will lose 90% of the time.\n- unless you learn the new quirks, you will lose 90% of the time\n- the online  player vs player is unfair, it puts... imagine this, lvl 1's vs level 80's. because nobody else is there.\n- ergo you may be completely new and be forced to fight a veteran who strings combos for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles.\n13. On purpose - the community is not there at all. Way too few people do MKX anymore.\n14. OH wait, of you wanted character variety, in isn't there anymore. Unless you pay!\n15. No 300 challenges tower like in MK9. Towers refresh every day and are EASY!!! And I am a rougher than the average player!!!\n16. I do recommend this game to people who wants to get their frustration off of something. MKX is a really good option!\n17. PC support is slim to none as of right now. No extra combat packs or improved versions. We have been mightily screwed.\n\nWTF people!!! MK9 blew the community apart!!! MK10 is like... crickets in he dark!!! No no, no, no, NO! I can't recommend this game. I will still get my pleasure out f it, because I am a casual gamer, but, if you are more serious than me - just don't buy it! There is so much it does wrong in comparison to MK9, it is insane. 28 characters vs roghly 50? Run vs No run? SP vs virtually none? Yeah, THat's what MKX is. WHile I would still get my value out of my money (cause the game is like 16€ for me), I would stilll not recommend it. To any of my friends.\n\nThat being said, I will still play it now and then. And hope for better ping.","August 27, 2015","false","9.7"," 98 of 117 people (84%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","84","98","117","10","17"

Sadly, this game is not worth your time on PC if you ever plan on purchasing it. At launch this game was pretty terrible, and with a major patch it wiped a lot of saved data - meaning you had to restart all over again. A select few were given a token to unlock everything, but really it should've been offered to everyone before a certain date of purchasing the game.\n\nMonths later (or practically a year) the PC customers were abandonned by the developers, and will not be getting anymore content. NetherRealm and Warner Bros. have now been boycotted by myself and a few rightfully angry consumers.\n\nThe experience I've had with Mortal Kombat X as a game.\nDespite the negative review, this game is really fun! I really enjoyed the campaign and I certainly enjoyed the multiplayer aspect. At launch it wasn't really running very well, but I've handled worse with my laptop years ago. After the major patch that wiped my save data I was really, really upset with the developers, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt after venting my anger towards them through emails, tweets, and Facebook messages to demand a token to unlock all the kyrpt items. After every major update I had comeback to test out the game. Overtime, the game finally became better optimized enough for my PC to handle it at 60 FPS (regardless if I exceeded Recommended specs), and I considered coming back into the game.\n\nI'll be happy to play the game every once in a while, but I certainly will NEVER recommend this game to a single person who plays on PC. You can buy it on Xbox One or PS4, but as the developers abandonned this game I refuse to give this game a recommendation.\n\nHow can this game be redeemed?\nSimple, the developers should continue support.","January 20","false","17.4"," 48 of 50 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","48","50","0","0"

The memory leak "seems" fixed for the moment and the game appears to be much more stable.\n\n+ I only did a couple of online bouts and the experience was surprisingly smooth compared to initial release.\n\n+ Living Towers offer a good alternative to the classic arcade tower with a ton of modifiers and challenges along the way.  It still feels a little tedious after a few, but definitely an improvement on the idea.\n\n+ Being able to overlay combos / specials / finishers on the screen while you fight was extermely helpful at times especially in story mode when you are switching characters every few fights.\n\n-  Between mobile and console/PC versions the developer makes too many attempts to reach into my wallet.  It is extremely tacky and distracts from the game.  The focus that was placed on this should have been spent on making the game a better experience, but that would've cost money instead of made it so what motivation did they have.  On day one this was a $30 game at best considering how much money would be made on DLC / microtransactions.  Develeoper greed is definitely out of control at the cost of quality making us quite literally pay more for less.\n\n-  Loss of tag modes... why?  It was so much fun and when I could actually convince someone to play with me locally it kept their interest longer since they could essentially test out two characters in a single match.\n\n-  No stage fatalities which have been a staple of the series throughout and a few of the backgrounds seemed well suited for a good set up.\n\n-  Too few background stages that become repetitive and worn out quickly.\n\n- Story mode, for me, seemed far too short or at least much shorter than MK9.  I was both surprised and a bit disappointed it was over so quickly.  Too many playable characters had a miniscule / meaningless role in the story such as Baraka, Reptile, Jax, Kitana, Kung Lao, etc. - Erron Black and Ferra/Torr were completely disposable and had zero explanation or back story.  Lots of fleshing out could've been done, but this game was clearly rushed out the door.  Major plot events such as Scorpion being released from Quan Chi's power and his humanity restored went by so quick I didn't even notice when it happened.  Suddenly he was human and I was like ... okay, that's cool, but when did that happen?  I had to go back and then noticed it happened when Sub-Zero and Jax were released as well.  If your audience can so easily miss such a pivotal plot point you've not done your job correctly.  And the glowy green power Johnny / Cassie absorb and display prior to giving Shinnok a royal beatdown ... was that ever explained?  Also, the vintage character's overwhelming trust in the new recruits to perform tasks far outside their abilities and confidence level seems horribly naive and misplaced.  And then trusting them to defeat Shinnok seems unbelievable if not utterly ludicrous.  The ending, regardless of how short and full of missteps the ride there ended up being, was satisfying and the potential set up for a sequel was interesting.  Also, I hope Rain becomes a playable character at some point since his fighting style seemed pretty reasonably fleshed out in the story.\n\n-  Speaking of the new recruits, I don't think Neatherealm did nearly enough with them to make them interesting as fighters or for the player to have much if any investment in them in story mode.  Takeda and Kung Jin's move sets were okay, Cassie's was decent, but just felt like regurgitated ideas from Johnny Cage and Sonya which was intentional, and Jacqui Briggs seemed completely uninspired.  As for other new characters D'Vorah was interesting, Erron Black was kinda fun, but Ferra/Torr was just weird and as a fighter did not interest me at all.\n\n-  The new crypt design is a pain in the ***.  It is nearly impossible to follow what you have and have not opened.  It's no wonder they offered the abillity to pay and unlock it all because going through and trying to do it manually, even if you had infinite coins to start with, would be an exercise in frustration.  Whoever designed this needs to be punched in the jeans.\n\nIn summation, my review is still negative and I deem its predecesser MK9 a far better overall game that Neatherealm seemed to really pour their heart and soul into so if you don't have it go pick it up.  This game needed a more fleshed out story with less day one DLC and preferably zero microtransactions, less disposable characters, more stages, a more logically designed crypt, and without tag modes and stage fatalities completely missing.\n\n\nOriginal Review\n-----------------------\nI'll keep this short since it has already all been stated ad nauseum.\n\nThe game looks great and seems like it would be a truly worthy successor to the great reboot that was accomplished in MK9....\n\n.... however, the crippling memory leak and seemingly unoptimized state of the game and its netcode makes it un-recommendable by me and I've loved this franchise since MK1 (sans Deception thru Armageddon).  Releasing the game in this state is inexcusable.  I don't fully understand why High Voltage Software was hired to port this with their track record - as I know it anyway which may admittedly be a little narrow.\n\nIn addition the DLC strategy with this game is sickening.  If there is another after this I will not be paying full price for half of an unfinished and unoptimzed game.  This nickel and diming the customer to no end is really getting out of control.","May 3, 2015","false","20.6"," 201 of 288 people (70%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","70","201","288","15","9"

The Steam version will not be receiving the netcode update, the patch to Mortal Kombat XL, or any futher DLC. We will be receiving "bug support" whatever that means. If you're thinking about buying MKX, don't. Don't support WB on PC.\n\nUpdate A whopping 15GB patch has dropped that's fixed major bugs, as well as addressing some of my bigger complaints. There's also been a few scraps thrown our way as an apology. So whilst this is a step in the right direction. I don't think it excuses the appalling way that we've been treated as customers. The micro transactions are still there. Goro is still behind a pay wall, and that obnoxious paid cheat to "unlock all Krypt items" is still there. So I'm sorry but the review remains negative.\n\nOriginal Review Following in the steps of Capcom, Nether Realm Studios have decided to release one my favourite fighting game franchises, Mortal Kombat, one slice at a time. But to those who are sceptical, allow me to explain why this is totally a great thing, and not just them caving into the greed of Warner Bros.\n\nWith this new way of selling games Nether Realm Studios have finally been able to give us a true Mortal Kombat experience. As this is a true "next gen" title. All of the colour, personality, silicon, and charm; have been squeezed from our favourite fighters. Now they act like real human beings, with raw surging emotions, who now and again engage in brutal to the death combat. Which really helps build immersion and add to the overall experience.\n\nRemember how hard the old fatalities were to pull off in the classic games? Well, some may argue that pulling off a hard fatality combo gave you a real sense of accomplishment (on top of the joy of watching Ketchup and Mustard predator punch three heads off of Scorpion) we all know that's just nostalgia clouding their minds though. The real sense of accomplishment comes from entering your credit card information (or your parents information! We didn't forget about you squeakers!) and buying “koins” to make fatalities even easier to pull off. You see, being able to press three buttons in sequence is time consuming, and most of us already have our PayPal accounts linked to Steam anyway.  Besides, seeing the same two fatalities over and over again never gets old! They're so brutal, that repeat viewings totally does not numb you to their effect. It certainly doesn't make you roll your ♥♥♥♥ing eyes when the twenty third online encounter uses THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ING SCORPION FATALITY. The same fatality that we've seen since the first gameplay trailer. Of course it doesn't!\n\nRight, I think you get the gist of this. This game is just, it's just, ♥♥♥♥. Most of the things that make a Mortal Kombat game what it is have been stripped to appeal to God knows who, because I certainly don't remember asking for this. To go into detail about how utterly wank the story is would require another three paragraphs, but don't worry, I won't put you through that. I'll just say this. It literally ends like a cheesy, family friendly, action flick. Think Last Action Hero, but with zero self awareness. Most of the new characters, whilst having interesting designs, are as generic as the pallet swapped ninjas of old. Jacqueline Briggs is basically girl Jax, Cassie Cage is girl Johnny Cage, whilst Takashi and Jung are so bland and forgettable I actually had to look up their names during this review.\nThe micro transactions can ♥♥♥♥ right off. Here's a sure way to know a developer has zero faith in the lifespan of their product. Pay walls, day 1 DLC, and paid cheats. What's really sad is that the actual fighting is the best it's ever been. It actually feels like a proper fighting game now, (something that fits in nicely between Street fight and Tekken) but you have to put up with so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, that it's just not worth it in the end.\n\nI honestly didn't want to make this long winded ♥♥♥♥♥fest of a review, at least not one about a Mortal Kombat game. The original intent was for it to be completely satirical, but once I hit the third paragraph I just couldn't take it anymore. This is an ugly, brown, poorly optimized, “next gen”, micro and macro transaction riddled pile of mediocrity, and it definitely doesn't deserve your money. ♥♥♥♥ this game.","April 30, 2015","false","96.9"," 391 of 590 people (66%) found this review helpful 117 people found this review funny","66","391","590","117","27"

Quan chi is the main devil in every MK game even more devil than shao kahn and here in MK X he is just a ♥♥♥♥♥ being slapped by EVERYONE, the only thing which does not beat quan chi is the dog in Destoryed City background! if you want a good review of story youtube angry joe's review over MK X he descirbed this game really well!\n\nGameplay: without doubt the worst MK made to the date and even PS2 games were better than this, it is the MOST unbalanced fighter i have ever played, the over head punches differ for each character, and most of them have super long range overheads which leads to combo such as Kung jin, Variations are a joke only a few characters truely have variation and rest of them are completely same except with one extra move in each variation, however some characters like Ermac and mileena only have ONE useful variation that forces the play to only use that one because rest of them are auto loss for you. Character frames are so screwed up and it causes massive advantages specially in online with that delay we got. Variations were only an excuse to develop less characters.\n\nDLC: well like every other game which has game changing DLC, MK X also has a few pay to win features. DLC characters are ALL op as hell specialy in first 30 days of release until they get patched. why? becuase they want them to sell good for people who seek pay to win! and lately about kombat pack 2 it completley shows NRS is ignoring its classic fans and only listening to casuals to sell more DLCs. how? they only and only bring guest characters to this garbage game.\n\n2015 was truely a next generation era because every video game released in this year was made for next generation kids who were touching any franchies for a first time nad had no idea what the original is.\n\ni was the most hardcore MK fan ever my entire life and room and everything was decorated by MK but NO more after MK X. i no longer care if a new one comes or not this game is forever dead to me!","April 17, 2015","false","322.4"," 318 of 483 people (66%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","66","318","483","22","28"

I put aside all the flaws, gave it a chance, enjoyed the good parts. But now, I am completely ♥♥♥♥ed off, and will not be buying from Warner Bros ever again.\n\nFor a $60 game, it is broken and not worth it. It is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port with horrible FPS at times. It controls horribly for PC. The matchmaking doesn't work, and if you do get in to a match it will time out or fail to connect, or have extreme lag. But the thing that really made me snap, was that Warner Bros aren't even releasing the second Kombat Pack for PC! After paying $5 for friggin' Predator, I expected a Xenomorph to fight with as well!\n\nWarner Bros are a horrific company who need to be held accountable for their cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC ports, their lousy business standards, and cash-grab attempts. In my opinion they are the worst of the worst, because unlike EA or Ubisoft, THEY MAKE EXCUSES FOR THEIR ♥♥♥♥♥♥ BROKEN GAMES. They purposefully exclude a huge section of the market for their own selfish benefit. They fail to fix games, even months after release, focusing on paid DLC instead of patches.\n\nWarner Bros, I will never purchase another game from you again. You have ♥♥♥♥ed up one too many times, with Batman and now this (let alone the various other games you've ruined). All I wanted was my own Alien vs Predator match, and you've ruined that for me to cater to the console kid gamers.","January 20","false","48.1"," 31 of 31 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","31","31","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/1374427/recommended/307780/","1374427","Augmented Vision","http://steamcommunity.com/id/1374427/","213 products in account","The game has been out for almost three weeks at the time of this review. 5/4/2015. Jason will be released early tomorrow for Kombat Pack owners, just as a reference for when this was written. My PC can overkill this game, all performance problems are from the game itself being EXTREMELY poorly optimized.\n\nEdit[5/17/2015]: PS4 has a new patch and PC of course, does not. Xbox One does not either, but it was confirmed to be coming in a day or two. PC however, must wait. How long? They didn't say. They never say. They never acknowledge that the PC version exists.\n\nEdit[5/28/2015]: We still don't have the patch. There has been no word on when it's coming, and both NRS and HVS has refused to keep us updated. We know nothing. We don't know when it'll come, if it'll come with Tanya's release, and we don't even know when they're releasing the future DLC characters because they don't keep their word on deadlines. ♥♥♥♥ this piece of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nEdit[5/30/2015]: AS OF TODAY APPARENTLY EVERY TIME YOU CLOSE STEAM IT UNINSTALLS MKX AND TRIES TO REINSTALL. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥. WHAT. THE. ♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥ this game. ♥♥♥♥ High Voltage Studios. Do not buy anything that has their stench on it.\n\nTHE BAD\n- The netcode(or netkode, get it?) is truly awful. I've never had a match that I felt was just fine or even remotely free from lag. It doesn't suffer from this as much as a game like Street Fighter, but it still sucks.\n\n- The game randomly crashes online, sometimes ranked or player matches will flat out crash my video drivers and after troubleshooting and getting several different versions of them, I can safely say it's not the drivers. Alright, let's say it doesn't crash. It takes several minutes to find a match sometimes, it's clearly broken. There are not that little players playing. Okay okay, it finally gets a match after 5 minutes of waiting in queue. Mid-game you can get an error that says "The game session is no longer available" and it boots you out. Then sometimes you can't even enter rooms because the chat server is down. Great!\n\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0kOekwEqLE\n\n- It fails to fully record my online stats. It says I have like 20 fatalities, but 0 wins online? Really? How is that even possible? I even have the 10 ranked match wins in a row achievement on steam.\n\n- It has random FPS drops/performance issues. I've never actually been able to replicate it, but it'll just drop from 60 fps to 45 or 30 for a while and it's never consistent. I've only noticed that it happens more often than not on the stages with snow/rain falling. It fixes itself when it goes into an x-ray which is really weird. It happens offline in training mode too.\n\n- Steam Cloud has been erasing people's saved games.\n\n- People have been having insane memory leak problems.\n\n- Some Faction options are disabled randomly for some reason, I still have no idea what causes this as I've tried it logged into my WBID and without, it just works whenever the ♥♥♥♥ it wants to.\n\n- Somewhat imbalanced character quality wise. Bojutsu Kung Jin has so many mix-up options, while Shinnok is in the toilet.\n\nTHE GOOD\n- Graphics look great when it's at 60fps, the stages look awesome. I like the Jinsei Chamber.\n\n- Story mode is 3-ish hours with optional QTEs and nigh seamless transitions to fights. It's not as long as MK9 but it's still very cool.\n\n- Zoning is much weaker than the past game, mostly with the addition of running/stamina. Running also adds depth to combos.\n\n- The newcomers are very cool and unique, while some of the returning cast get very good looking redesigns.\n\n- Variations potentially triple the entire roster. Some 100% change the character into something new, while others are just small preferential changes. Unfortunately, some aren't good at all. Why wouldn't you pick Thundergod Raiden over Displacer?\n\n- Extensive training mode options.\n\n- Frame data in the game(whether it's all 100% accurate is unknown but it's mostly correct.)\n\n- Fatalities are as gory as ever.\n\n- WHEN THE GAME ACTUALLY WORKS LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO, IT'S FUN.\n\nThe Verdict\nIt's okay. If there were a neutral option I would pick it here. When it works, it's fun and I enjoy it greatly. When it doesn't work, it doesn't work. If you really want this game, get it on PS4 or Xbox One. Don't get the PC version, at least until they fix it and the community is happy with it. If you MUST buy the PC version, don't get it full priced, snag a CD key from another website for like $20.","May 4, 2015","false","170.7"," 114 of 167 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","114","167","5","1"

I have always placed mk on a pedestal along with many other gamers, this is my absolute favorite fighting game.\n\nmk has seen better days and deserves a quality port.  My computer is fine, I can normally run 2d fighting games at 4k and have them be at least 30 fps.  I am currently playing gta5 maxed out and at 45 to 60 fps, in fact the only games I can't play maxed out and near 60 fps are unoptimized ports. This is the absolute worst.  Anyone with a half decent pc should be able to run a 2d fighter and hit 30 fps, not so here.  I am only getting 5 more frames per second playing at 1080p than at 4k.  I get maybe 25 fps at 4k and maybe 30 at 1080p, even so the game is so choppy and stuttering.  One forest level is completely pixelated.  This is after the 15gb update, truly unacceptable.

It's a shame cause as a fighting game it's possibly one of the best. The gameplay feels excellent, like you're doing some serious damage to your opponent, the brutalities, x-rays and finishers are excellent but as a  whole it feels unfinished and NetherRealm is spoon-feeding you extra content for a price. This game has other issues aside from this, but this is my BIGGEST problem. Let's break this down.\n\nAs of this review there are 5 pieces of DLC.\n\nKombat Pack: £24.99. 4 new characters (not including Goro), includes a themed skin pack for each, includes Samurai pack.\n\nUnlock all Krypt Items: £14.99. Unlock every item in the krypt (skins, moves, concept art, badges etc), rather than spending Kombat Koins earned by playing the game or through microtransactions.\n\nSamurai Pack: £2.79. 3 new samurai-themed skins.\n\nBlue Steel Sub-Zero: £1.59. Sub-Zero skin\n\nGoro: £3.99. Goro is playable, you unlock him if you preordered it also.\n\nMobile App: £Free. Free mobile app to unlock skins that can only be unlocked via mobile. App isn't accessible in most regions including United Kingdom.\n\nThis is insanity. Kombat pack is fine but overpriced, Unlock everything in the krypt is insulting, Samurai/Sub-Zero skin whatever, Goro was an incentive to pre-order the game.\n\nOther issues include the game being poorly optimised, it used to dip below 40fps in most stages but that's been fixed, hardly any game modes, not that many characters to choose from, not many stages. Without a doubt there will be a "komplete edition" with all the DLC bundled, you're paying full price for half a game, pay extra for the rest.","April 22, 2015","false","8.4"," 68 of 99 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","68","99","4","0"

The Mortal Kombat franchise is one of the first I remember playing & it's very disheartening to hear that they've left us out in the cold. This is purely speculation, but I believe this occurred because Warner Brothers cut ties with High Voltage Studios after the disasters with several game launches on PC, including MKX. Even if this isn't the case, it still would have been nice to hear it from NetherRealm in a video when they announced Kombat Pack 2 instead of making fans play the guessing game for a while before making a forum post on TestYourMight. Honestly, I'm more upset that they were not upfront about the situation than I am about the lack of content.

The game itself is the best iteration that was made by NRS so far. It has a nice story, big roaster of characters and tons of content. NRS deserves to be praised here, no doubt. It is possible that you may be reading this review and thinking "so why shouldn't i consider buying this game if it is so good?". The answer is that MKX port was at deaths door from the start. It was poorly...no...BADLY ported. FPS drops, memory leak and etc. But the thing that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me completely off was save data loss. And everytime when something was happening to this game, preventing me from normal play, I continued playing it with hope that eventually the problems will be fixed. And you know, all the problems i had were fixed. And now when everything seems almost fine with this port NRS says that Kombat Pack 2 will be available  for PS4 and XB1 only. I know that it is likely not their decision not to release KP2 on PC but WB's one. But still I'm sure that NRS took a hand in this decision. It means we are not getting new chracters, new skins, new patches. And as a consequence it will be impossible to stay competetive player. Also there is no any sign that enhanced online will be released on PC too. So, it looks like 75% of the whole game will be available for PC users. WB and NRS are scam and they don't care about 500.000 users who have already bought this game on Steam. And I appeal to all of you to not to buy any NRS game in the future and WB's ones particularly, because that is not the first time when they screwed up the AAA title game. For example, Batman Arkham Knight. If you want to know, what's wrong with that game, you better go read the reviews. So, I hope nobody will make the mistake I did almost a year ago and will not getting this game.","January 20","false","302.0"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","22","22","0","1"

This is quite shameful and disrespectful towards their consumers, made all the more embarrasing since this is not only a good game but it could have been fixed and supported in which if they played their cards right it would bring more people into playing it.\n\nLong story short, this game has been abandoned and will remain incomplete compared to the console versions.","January 20","false","97.4"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","0"

Please consider the following before making a final decision on your purchase.\n\nJanuary Twenty-First.\nThe latest announcement for the PC commuity in MKX was more than revealing. tylerlansdown,\na Community Specialist for Netherrealm Studios released a post on the community forums, stating that "Mortal Kombat XL and Kombat Pack 2 will available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One only."\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with The Kombat Pack 2, it is DLC that allows access to several unreleased fighters. This DLC will not be coming to the PC. People paid money for the Season Pass to get access to the DLC. These people will not be able to gain access to the new DLC.\n\nThis final decision was most likely made by WB, not Netherrealms. This is indicated by WB's terrible port for the launch game of MKX for PC - which was terribly optimized and required another studio to port the game. The fanbase stuck with the studio to the very end, buying DLC, Season Passes, and following the hype. Sorry to say this but we got played.\n\nIt's a fun fighting game that had a terrible release and end for PC. However, if you go out and spend money on the game you are allowing WB to know that you (the fanbase) are okay with them bending you over and sticking it where the sun don't shine.\n\nUse your voice.\n\nJust pirate the game.\n\n\n\nSources:\nAnnouncement:\nhttp://testyourmight.com/threads/future-of-mkx-on-pc-kp2-mkxl-confirmed-console-only.58181/page-7#post-1999319\n\nOwners Data (RIP):\nhttp://steamspy.com/app/307780","January 21","false","60.2"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","0"

However, the PC version is garbage. The port has been a nightmare since day 1 and many "patches" have only made things worse.\n\nSo... after a 15 gig patch to "fix" the game but ended up erasing everyone's saves, they pulled the patch and sent out another 15 gig update to revert the patch. Then about 24 hours later they push out another 15 gig patch that actually DID fix a ton of issues I've been having with the game.\n\nThere's still a few stages that have poor performance, but they're actually playable now. I'm still going to say I don't recommend this game while it's still in BETA apparently. 45 GIGS of updates within 24 hours is absolutely unacceptable, especially since everyone's saves and progress is gone forever.

This isn't just blind rage, it's just that, unfortunately, the most important thing for a fighting game of this type is the community, especially one that focuses so heavily on the online experience as this one does. The game itself is stellar, and the port (despite a very rocky beginning) was patched up to perform quite well.

I was so hyped by the first trailer i didn't sleep that night. And few days ago they announced the online enhanced, with something that i wanted since release: improved netcode!\nAnd now i just discovered that they won't be releasing this on pc.\nI forgave them the horrible launch, i forgave them the crappy netcode. But this? Aren't you supposed to fix what you broke? Isn't it the right thing to do to keep supporting your game? If you want to drop pc support, do it with your next game, but don't split the fanbase in half and force the people that already bought it on pc to buy it again on ps4 or xbone.\nYou really dissappoint me.","January 20","false","358.2"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

I was one of the best players on street, untill i found more hard players, which was more better in reaction and strategy of fight's. So that's life...there always a bigger fish, then you.\n\nSeveral years later our neighbour got PS 1 and MK 4 on it (he also have other games, but MK 4 is all what I remember). I spend a lot playing that one on his console (at his home or he brought his console sometimes to my house and we played some sort of tournament between our street friends). Also I replayed numerous times MK Trilogy, which I still keep at my hard disc untill today.\n\nSince 2009 I heard a rumours about MK Komplete and was happy when it finally get in PC. Without a doubt I buy 2 copies of the game for me and my brother. And even more I was glad about storyline and how it goes - I liked it more then story of Deadly Allience & Armageddon, which I played on emulation (i am secret smoke human version fan, although his cyborg form was not bad).\n\nAnd finally MK X get's in April of 2015. For two month I save money for preorder the Game. And it's when "All Story" begins:\n-First of all it's patches (when my download channel is 12mb/s max, can't change on current living place, still working on that) - daily downloading for the game, when others already play it in first day.\n-Second a DLC which was not a DLC, but a Season Pass instead.\n-New strange characters...I really don't understand why they brought here serial killer's and use childrens or descedant's of famous characters (which also have appereance in game) instead of remember old and forgotten characters.\n\n-And Final - throwing off support of PC players, by not releasing impoved netcode, Kombat Pack 2 (Leatherface, Bo'Rai Cho, Triborg, Xenomorph) and Mortal Kombat XL.\n\nReally after all this years I am done with MK franchise.","January 26","false","27.0"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","19","19","0","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/realkct/recommended/307780/","realkct","Real KCT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/realkct/","261 products in account","Summary: Easy to learn, graphically fantastic, terrible online experience.\n\nUpdate 2: Over a month since my initial purchase on release. It's rare that a day goes by without steam trying to download between 500mb & 10gb of patches for this game. What it's patching I have no idea & I am certainly beyond caring. What a terrible release.\n\nUpdate: Since the latest 15gig patch I can confirm that the online now runs at 60fps.\nHowever, I have had repeated trouble connecting online matches with wait times over 2 minutes & have repeatedly seen King Of The Hill matches drop mid-fight. Leaderboards are still not reporting correctly & search parameters to find good connections are still non existant.\n\n-----\n\nMortal Kombat X is a great looking game & compared to other titles in the fighting game genre, relatively easy to learn with forgiving controls & few mechanical systems to learn.\n\nWhile MKX doesn't have as strong a story as MK9, due to the extensive cinematic presentation, the story mode is far better presented than most other games of this genre. However, short of farming the game's inbuilt unlockable currency 'koins' to acquire additional costumes & concept art you probably wouldn't want to play it through more than the once. Completion of the story mode will average you around 5 hours max.\n\nAs with all fighting games, the meat of the product is with the competitive VS mode.\n\nLocally as with the story mode detailed above, it runs at 60 FPS, looks amazing on max settings & as such the only lag for your input depends on your monitor or television's refresh setting & your system itself. Online is a whole different story & ultimately where the game (in its present state) suffers a real 'fatality'.\n\nAs with MK9 before it & the PC release of both SFIV & KoF, the netcode is spotty at best, outright broken at its worst.\n\nThe frame rate drops down to a locked 30fps for online matches, making all the combos & control inputs you learn locally in practice & story mode, completely worthless. Added to that an omni-present lag both in the character select menus & the combat itself & finally an inability to be able to search by parameters for ideal connections & you have an unenjoyable mess of a product. It's also worth pointing out that at the present time, even if you do can connect (or find) a ranked match, that the leaderboards for this mode are also completely broken.\n\nIf you plan to take this game seriously at a FGC competitive level, you'd be best served getting the PS4 version as it's undoubtedly what will be used by organisers at tournaments anyway! Reports also state that the net-code on that system is comparatively problem free as it was developed in house by Netherrealm themselves, unlike this outsourced, seemingly second class PC version.\n\nNegatives aside regarding the online, If you just want to see where Mortal Kombat has come in the last 20+ years, there's a large variation of single player endurance & challenge modes & a trouble free experience of playing friends locally. Showing off all the outrageously gruesome fatalaties is likely to provide half an hour of entertainment during a game night at the least.\n\nIt stands to reason, that when the most important component of a fighting game is in such a sorry & broken state, that I can't recommened the product.","April 19, 2015","false","21.8"," 96 of 152 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","96","152","5","0"

It was such a horrible port that not a single soul who pre ordered was able to play for a couple of days. and is still plagued by issues. last patch was released in September last year, and nothing since. do not support this kind of business practice. Also, Ed Boon is a big fat liar.","January 20","false","7.5"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

It features 26 playable characters (35 if you include all the DLC) with each characters having 3 different variations that are designed to fulfill specific roles (zoning, trapping, rushdown and so on). The variations provide changes in terms of moves and combos, so in reality you're looking at a game with potentially 105 characters (DLC included), which is a lot. The characters are well balanced for the most part, which means whichever character you choose to main will probably also be tournament viable if you get good enough at the game.\n\nThe game is also very fast paced for a fighting game, and offers players tons of content, from a (good, but short) story mode; to traditional towers in which the player has to beat a series of AI opponents with a final boss at the top; to living towers (regular towers that get updated with new challenges every once in a while to mix things up) and more casual game modes such as test your might and test your luck. It also features a return of the Krypt, in which you can unlock various costumes, fatalities and other behind the scenes novelties.\n\nThis port had a rocky start when it first launched on PC, with people not being able to get past the main menu due to its many issues, but most of the issues it had are now fixed. All in all, the game continues Netherealm Studios' tradition of offering the player great value for money by showering him with tons of quality content - a lot more than what you'll find in any other fighting game out there.\n\nSo why am I not recommending this?\n\nAs of January 20th, Netherealm had announced that they are dropping support for Mortal Kombat X on the PC. This means that the Kombat Pack 2 DLC, featuring Triborg, Bo Rai Cho, Leatherface and Xenomorph, will not be released on PC at all. This also means that PC users will not get the updated netcode that is currently being developed for the console users, and will have to stick to the inferior (and quite horrible) netcode the game currently has. On top of all that, every new balance patch the game receives from now on will not make it to the PC. In sum, anyone who plays this game on PC is doomed to play an inferior and different game than the console version. You'll have less characters, worse online, and worst of all - the frame data on your moves list will not be compatible to the frame data of your console counterparts, which means that any effort of friendly competitive play between a PC user and a console user will automatically put the PC user at a disadvantage (if you had plans to play this game competitively in casual tournamens like I had, you might as well forget about it).\n\nNow lets be clear: while I do hold Netherealm Studios responsible for this to some extent, in my book the main villain of this is Warner Brothers, who now demonstrate a pattern of releasing shoddy game ports on PC (Batman: Arkham Knight, anyone?) followed by quickly dropping support for said ports. That company proves time and time again that it doesn't care about PC consumers by outsourcing games to bad port developers and quickly dropping support for said ports in favor of making new DLC. This is quite embarrassing for the company, as it turns away from the few people still willing to give it money for its horrible PC releases.\n\nIf you're a fan of Mortal Kombat, consider buying it on console as it is indeed a good game. If you're strictly a PC user, however, don't bother. You'll be playing an inferior product that will be vastly different from the main game. Also, in the future, if you encounter a Warners Brothers game that is being ported to the PC - avoid it like the plague. I know I will.","January 26","false","11.9"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

If you have friends to play it with it might be worth getting it right now but if you don't I would hold off for either an update or price drop.\n\nCurrent Issues my friends and I have ran into:\n\nCrash to desktop on leaving multiplayer matches sometimes, normally happens when we want to switch up who in the group we are playing against.\nGame will lock up sometime without actually locking up, it's almost as if it got stuck in some loop where by the game is responding but you can't actually do anything. Normally this is accompanied by a loading screen for online play\nGetting into a private match online is kind of hit or miss sometimes. I've had times where a friend invites me and after accepting it won't put me in the match and instead pulls him a random opponent despite the fact they chose private match.\nTo build on the last point this happens more often in Towers and King of the Hill. We'll setup a private match and all of a sudden random person we didn't invite gets in\nSome of us are getting really bad frame drops on certain levels and that can generally be fixed by messing with settings but you have to go and edit a file to change some of them. If the setting actually exists for editing it should be editable in game. Honestly that just comes across as lazy, I'm not going to sit here and say that would be an easy thing to add because I have no idea what their code looks like but I was really hoping that would turn up in a patch by now.\nFaction related stuff is hit or miss sometimes it's up sometimes it's down\nBad match making, when we play against each other the latency is not an issue at all because we live in the same state but it seems when we do match making the game doesn't take into account the latency as well as it should\nGameplay wise the game is great and I highly recommend it if you are a fighting game fan but if you happen to have a PS4 or Xbox One perhaps consider getting it on there instead.","May 3, 2015","false","30.6"," 43 of 62 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","43","62","4","0"

In any other industry, this would be illegal and worthy of outrage but it has taught me one important lesson.

However, the port of the game to PC is once again a disappointment so far, and until some things are fixed, like the performance, frame rate drops, not being able to play decent matches online without disconnecting, random crashes,, not being able to do anything with the faction system because you can never connect to the faction server, a patch that is 15GB for about 5 fixes, all problems that are all almost non existant on consoles. I recommend staying far away from the PC port of this game and just go get it on console, because the game is amazing and a must have, but the port on PC is so far dreadful. I'm willing to forgive you NRS if you fix some of this crap.\n\nIn summary, I would recommend the PC port of this game to anyone who:\n-only has a PC to play on and doesn't have either XB1 or PS4\n-has a high-end, expensive computer that can run the game\n-is willing to put up with a bunch of BS and work to get the game working, changing settings, looking up guides on how to get it to work, and willign to put up with all the above problems ^.\n\nIf any of those are you, all the power to you, get this game and enjoy. If none of these are you, i would recommend just getting it on console, cause this is a disaster.","April 18, 2015","false","95.7"," 53 of 80 people (66%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","66","53","80","6","0"

This however was not the case with Mortal Kombat X. Upon launch, as I am sure you are well aware, the PC port was prone to a wildly inconsistent frame rate, unpredictable crashes, data wipes and, an unusable netcode for online play among other issues. I resisted the urge to immediately demand a refund as I had fallen to the sunk cost fallacy (having bought the game and the kombat pack) as well as having faith in Netherealm's announcement that they would fix the game. Fast forward a few weeks, the game received two massive patches in one day. The first one crashed the game and wiped user's local save data. The second one was implemented to fix the first patch. Neither of these two patches fixed the other problems the game had. Netherrealm made numerous promises to their consumers to fix the game. It took nearly 6 months to finally have a stable build of the game for offline play. The netcode was still abysmal and the community was nearly dead. Fast forward to today, I learned that not only will PC users not have access to the new characters coming out in the next few weeks but I will also not have access to the improved netcode that will be implimented in the future. As a fan of Netherrealm's games, I that instead of being rewarded for having faith in the company and their product, I feel as if I am being punished for not demanding refund sooner.","January 20","false","91.1"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

I used to be heavily into Mortal Kombat, but stopped following the series sometime around Deadly Alliance.  The idea of getting back into the series seemed nostalgic and awesome.  I pre-ordered and anxiously awaited for it to be released.  I even upgraded my set up to the recommended specs to fully enjoy it.  When the game arrived, it was clearly not optimized for the PC.  There is a constant framerate stutter no matter what settings it is on.  There's also horrible online play that occasionally just refuses to work and won't connect to games.  Also, some features advertised for the console versions are just straight up missing in this.  It's clear the developers and the company responsible for the port just don't care about the PC community.  It's been three weeks since release, and these issues haven't been solved or even addressed in a satisfactory way.  I give up.  I'm uninstalling and not supporting these companies ever again.  It should be illegal to straight up sell a product that doesn't work as advertised and not be able to get a refund for it.  You'll see many reviews telling you that it indeed works on other people's computers.  And indeed it does.  It's random.  No one in the forums can figure out why it works for some and not for others.  So if you really want to play Mortal Kombat X on PC, you just have to ask yourself if the price is worth the coin toss.","May 1, 2015","false","53.9"," 42 of 62 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","42","62","4","0"

Its a constant headache and bandwidth bottomless pit. Even if Netherrealm Studios got off thier ♥♥♥ and fixed the constant updating bug, theyd just release a patch that deletes your gamesave. The game is horrendously ported. Runs way worse than MK9 by a long shot and has pathetic graphical optimization with unacceptable frame rate studdering. If you even try to connect to multiplayer you can expect to play the worst fighting game match up of your life. MK's community has taken a dark turn, compared to Street Fighter. At least the 30 different versions of street fighter IV work. I loved Mortal Kombat, but I think after this game, the series is finally dead. Netherrealm has a completely disrespectful, disregard for PC gaming and it has become apparent from them releasing such a broken title. Even Ubisoft addresses their game breaking bugs after a while. There is a noticable delay in between patches from the console versions; proving the consoles have priority over PC when it comes to updating the content. We also have experienced delays on every DLC so far with no apology as to why we had to endure such a horribly organized launch to the Jason DLC. Do yourself a favor and check both the community discussion and the lackluster announcements tab, to see the massive bug lists, broken gameplay and inexcusable amount of patching. This plays worse than any Early Access title I have ever played. I dont write a lot of negative reviews, but this is the LITERAL example of a bad port. Go with Blazblue or many of the other excellent fighting game ports, this one is a lost cause.","May 31, 2015","false","15.6"," 43 of 64 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","43","64","3","1"

Not until when a new set of third-party developers came in does the game finally shine.\n\nIf you're a fan of the series, you'll be plenty satisfied. Taking the lessons from the last Mortal Kombat game further, it's about a bone-snappingly appealing as is the gradually solidifying gameplay, that still has its own quirks. The story has a few surprises and is a visual feat, but does not have the crazy shocking moments that MK9 has.\n\nHowever, Consumer be warned. As of this and PLENTY of reviews below will attest, this is now officially the legacy port of the game. It will not recieve the upgrade to MKXL nor the Kombat Pack 2 characters. As a result, caution should be thrown as to how badly you wish to play this game of the series if you do not own either an XBone or PS4. That means no upgrade for the netcode (despite it being rather unfixed and still atrocious, even after multiple patches towards it), no further balance patch fixes, no extra anything. This game made me regret buying anything from WB Games and NRS.\n\nIf anything else, and you still want a decent fighting game that will still get better support and already ran through beta tests showing that things will work for you and your system, get Street Fighter V instead.\n\nTL;DR version - I do not recommend anyone getting this from this point on.","January 20","false","24.8"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","0"

Of the 5 or so hours I played I thoroughly enjoyed it and was looking forward to putting many hours into it. I was especially excited to hear about KP2 and the GGPO netcode fix coming only to discover today directly from NRS' mouth that they are dropping support for PC.\n\nIf this decision was based on WB's perceived notion that they wouldn't make a profit off the PC player base currently the irony is that fixing the netcode I'm sure would have brought back many players who in turn may have bought KP2 and any future DLC. I'm glad I only paid $15 for the game and that they didn't get any of that money. I will not buy any of WB or NRS games again. Vote with your wallet if you don't want this to happen again to the PC community.\n\nEDIT: The more I play MKX the more I love it but I wonder if continually playing it and building my skills is worth it in a game that for a lack of a better metaphor, has effectively had it's throat cut and is slowly bleeding to death.","January 20","false","23.7"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

I dealt with all the bugs, deleted saves, crappy netcode and myriad of performance problems because MK X in itself is a great game, and to this day I thoroughly enjoy playing it, but I DO NOT recommend anyone buy it on PC.\nWarner Brothers Games decided not to include Kombat Pack 2 on the PC platform and I feel very disappointed. I don't want to have to buy a console just to play this game on, especially when most of the game is on PC already. The botched launch left the community crippled and the lack of support is literally leaving the game to die.\nI guess this was my first AND last time I get burned by a company and pre-order just because it's my favorite franchise.

When everyone else on consoles received patches and updates, PC players were left waiting until Netherealm finally remembered to include us. Now Netherrealm has announced the Kombat Pack 2, which includes new fighters such as Alien, Leatherface, Triborg, and Bo Rai Cho as well as a new level (a fan favorite, The Pit). Not only that, but they have also announced Mortal Kombat XL which includes all of the players (including the new ones), all of the skins, and the new level The Pit.\n\nExciting right? Except that Netherrealm announced these would be available only for the PS4 and Xbox One.\n\nPC players, faithful fans, are left out of the fun. We don't get the new players, we don't get the new stage, we don't even get the new upgrade to multiplayer.

The only problem that remained was the netcode for the online multiplayer.\n\nMK X will no longer be supported by the devlopers or the publisher on PC, and that multiplayer fix is going to consoles only. Not only that, but the future Kombat Pack 2 characters won't be coming to PC either, and neither will the XL version of MK X. All of that hard work for nothing.\n\nI'll post my original positive review just so people can see what I thought of the game. Either way though, this game is soon going to be a drastically inferior version to the consoles, not in preformance, but in content. ♥♥♥♥ you Warner Brothers. If you have such little respect for your PC customers to abandon them like this, then please would you kindly get the ♥♥♥♥ off steam.\n\n----\n\nOriginal positive review-\n\nAh MK X. Never before have I felt so guilty for loving a game. I've spent somewhere around £80 on this game despite everything.\n\nThe port is still jank. Running my 970 I still get stutters on the charater select screen and during the intros/outros to each fight. The netcode is... Well, it's classic High Voltage netcode. It would seem at this point (months after launch) that WB have pulled the classic Batman Arkham Origins on us and decided that we need DLC charaters and skins before a fully functioning game. If you can get this on console instead, do it.\n\nHowever I never rarely go online (I suck and I find it stressfull) and I can overlook the preformance issues (Which in honesty for me are kinda minor) because I love MK X. In spite of everything. The fighting is better than ever, the roster is strong with not only a large range of charaters, but three variants for each, mixing up their already detailed mechanics for a completely (most of the time) different play styles. The story mode is good yet short, nearly half of what we got with MK 9, weaker but still a fun expereince in that department.\n\nYou're going to have to decide whether you can put up with the ♥♥♥♥ that is the PC version of this game to play it for yourself. I reccomend it purely off of my experince of the game alone. I'm just a bored anonymous guy writing into a box afterall. All I can say for certain is to NOT go near if you do not have a higher end of graphics card, or if you are looking for a good online experience.","January 21","false","56.4"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","1"

Looks great, runs at 60 FPS (but the fatalities, X-rays and cutscenes are locked at 30 FPS) and sounds great. As for the game, it's a very good MK. Not as good as 9, IMHO, but it's very fun, has a polished gameplay and a very interesting story mode.\n\nHOWEVER...\n\nThere's still one major problem with the PC port: the Netcode. For most people, the game is a PAIN to play online. Too laggy and unstable to be enjoyable. And the worst part: it seems like support for the PC port has been dropped by the publisher, and they don't even have the RESPECT to issue an official statement on WHY they dropped it.\n\nThe new netcode that the console versions are getting is NOT planned for this PC version. In fact, a NetherRealm employer even stated in a forum that the new (and enhanced) version of MKX is planned FOR CONSOLES ONLY. We won't get the Kombat Pack 2 that was promised, we won't get the new stages, nothing!\n\nThey are avoiding the PC community like a plague. They don't answer our questions, don't issue official statements, and don't even CARE about fixing the remaining issues (like gameplay balance!).\n\nAfter things like abandoning Gauntlet in a flawed state, releasing Batman: AK in THAT unplayable state, and what they are doing with us, I am done with WB Games. ¬¬","January 21","false","16.7"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

Lot of performance inconsistencies, unplayable stages (I'm looking at YOU, Sky Temple), lack of options on release.\n\nAfter months trying to fix up the game, though, they've decided to pull the plug, call it even, and not continue supporting the PC playerbase.

After the cough up at launch I must say this is the best Mortal Kombat up to date. The graphics are amazing. The gameplay is amazing and overall just brilliant all round. They’ve removed some characters from MK9 that I liked but brought some new ones in that are pretty good too.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is good. The fighting is amazing and all the characters have three different fight styles. After playing as each character I must say it’s very well balanced. Although some characters I think are harder to use than others. Oh and last thing… them fatalities…damn.\n\nGraphics\nThe characters and the arenas are brilliant and are very unique. The blood, sweat and mud/sand/snow (depending on the arena) all mix together in the middle of the fight making it really gritty. Oh and again… the fatalities…wow.\n\nStory\nThe story carries on from MK9 and for Mortal Kombat it's very good. You see a lot of characters from MK9 that you can't play as in 10 so that sucks a bit, but I must say, I did enjoy the story and I really got in to it.\n\nOverall I think this is an excellent fighting game and currently my favourite followed by MK9. I do wish there will be more skins for the characters in the future.

I pre-ordered it (never will do it again with any game by any publisher. Thanks for teaching me this lesson WB), I suffered first days where game was missing almost all the content. The only saving grace was that HVS, although clumsily, was trying to repair things. Rumour has it they got fired (thank gods if true!), and after several months game was brought to what we have today:\n- pretty graphics\n- fluent off-line play\n- nice story mode\n- several new features like living towers and premium towers\n- generally pretty enjoyable experience\n- Sub-Zero ;)\n\n♥♥♥♥♥♥ online was always NRS's mark, so I was not really surprised it is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ again in MKX.\n\nWhy the negative review then?\n\nBecause after game on PC was patched to the very satisfactory level, after an announcement has been made, that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ online will no longer be ♥♥♥♥♥♥, will have GGPO-like beta to improve it, after announcing another Kombat Pack (yeah, I got the KP1, too, silly me), we have been informed PC gamers will get none of this, implying the support for PC version has ended.\n\nIf you buy this game now, you will be stuck with game that lacks new content which console version will soon have (4 new characters, new stage(es), new reskins if anybody cares for them. Also - most likely and most importantly - new balance changes and improved online. This is why review cannot be anything else then negative. It breaks my heart, even so that after tiresome patching the future of this game on PC wasn't looking bad.\n\nIf things change, this rating may also change. If NRS provides some justification for treating MKX PC like it never existed, other then: we won't support MKX PC course in result of our not-giving-sht-about-pc-port player base on PC just moved away from our game.

They don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about their customers as evidenced by their actions, and as such don't deserve any to begin with. When (more like IF) they start respecting their fans as a whole across all platforms, as is deserved, then maybe it could be considered a better idea to buy their games.\nThe sad part is that lots of people like me bought the premium edition, which is by no means cheap, and most people would think that doing so would allow them some sort of special rights when it comes to DLC, usually in the form of a discount or early play. That way, eventually everyone will still get to play it. Dropping it completely is not only a foolish choice as a developer, but unfair on the whole community plus those that went the extra mile to be cut short.\n\nTL;DR ♥♥♥♥ you NRS, and ♥♥♥♥ you WB.

This was mostly because I played offline due to me not really enjoying fighting games without the person being right beside me to bicker and banter with.  So I don't really have a complaint about the port being bad at launch, it's unacceptable to have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port on any platform however.  My main problem is what everyone else has with this game now, the fact that WB/Netherrealm stopped supporting the game.  They announced a Season 2 of DLC characters and that was exciting, they announced Netcode updates for online which made people happy, and then they turn around and say that the PC will no longer be supported.  There was no real announcement of why they would stop supporting the PC.  If there was some explanation of why this was and not an excuse like lack of resources maybe this outlash about this game almost a year later wouldn't be as prominent.\n\nIn this day and age where we have the so called console wars we see more and more developers turn away from one platform or company to support one of the other.  This is twice now that a bad PC port has been delivered through Warner Brothers, the other being Arkham Knight.  I don't see why some companies seem to snuff off PC gaming and deliver sub-par or not deliver a product at all.\n\nDoes this mean this game isn't good?  No, as a matter of fact I liked and still like this game.  I will ocassionaly hop on when I have people over and play.  This game is fun, but if it is no longer going to get newer and better features it is not worth it.  I have minor gripes and groans about this game such as lack of certain characters and certain characters being in the game in general but those don't deter from this being a good game.  I would advise not buying this game unless things change.  Don't support companies snuffing off platforms or abandoning not even a year old game.","January 22","false","23.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Horrible bugs, terrible net code, crashing, save wipes, preorder dlc character, etc. You name it this game has gone through it.\n\nWhile after over a month of patches the game actually became in a pretty playable state even though the matchmaking was pretty much dead since no one wanted to play this broken pos. But there was a glimmer of hope with the announcement of an "enhanced online" with revamped netcode as well as new DLC Characters that looked awesome and a "complete edition with all the dlc". Now with this announcement you think "wow, that sounds great! That will surely revitalize the PC community after all the horrible bumps it went through". Wrong, as it's going to be exclusive to PS4 and Xbox One and the PC version will no longer be recieving support. As a huge Mortal Kombat fan who has played every single game for hours and hours. This game has been the single largest disappointment of all time. So my advice is if you want to get a "true experience" go play the console versions and don't waste your money like I did or you can tell WB Games, NRS and Ed Boon to suck it and not buy the game at all for allienating their fans and completely screwing us over.\n\nNRS, WB Games and Ed Boon\n\nThanks for Ruining Mortal Kombat for Me :)","January 20","false","49.9"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

I love MK, grew up with it, & I was livid with the great return of its 2009 reboot, even have the kick ♥♥♥ bookend collectors edition for PS3 & the classic arcade stick. So here I was, blowing 80$ for a game & season pass for another go to one of my favorite franchises, knowing my PC should rock it at 60 frames & I'd be sure to love it... With that said, boy was I so ♥♥♥♥ing wrong. It should be known now Wanerbrothers buissness practices for many of its PC ports is vile, & needs to be known. After putting up with the botched preload launch, awful porting with lists of techincal/ performance issiues, patiently waiting for oversized patch downloads to not even completly fix the game... Of course when I heard of the Xl netcode update with kombat pack 2, I was hopeful PC port would finally get touched up properly with the new wave of DLC to get it on par with the other versions...Now WB's & NR are taking our money & running, completly dropping future update support & DLC for the PC version... They didn't even respect the fans enough to outright publically accounce the drop of support or offer some kind of compensation, but instead have us come to that displeasure on our own findings leaving us with this broken game empty handed... Unacceptable. There are far better optimized & supported fighters on Steam, personally looking forward to Killer Instict's cross play PC port myself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dokusari/recommended/307780/","dokusari","Dokurai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dokusari/","241 products in account","On launch this game ran well for me and I didn't have any problems.  This was mostly because I played offline due to me not really enjoying fighting games without the person being right beside me to bicker and banter with.  So I don't really have a complaint about the port being bad at launch, it's unacceptable to have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port on any platform however.  My main problem is what everyone else has with this game now, the fact that WB/Netherrealm stopped supporting the game.  They announced a Season 2 of DLC characters and that was exciting, they announced Netcode updates for online which made people happy, and then they turn around and say that the PC will no longer be supported.  There was no real announcement of why they would stop supporting the PC.  If there was some explanation of why this was and not an excuse like lack of resources maybe this outlash about this game almost a year later wouldn't be as prominent.\n\nIn this day and age where we have the so called console wars we see more and more developers turn away from one platform or company to support one of the other.  This is twice now that a bad PC port has been delivered through Warner Brothers, the other being Arkham Knight.  I don't see why some companies seem to snuff off PC gaming and deliver sub-par or not deliver a product at all.\n\nDoes this mean this game isn't good?  No, as a matter of fact I liked and still like this game.  I will ocassionaly hop on when I have people over and play.  This game is fun, but if it is no longer going to get newer and better features it is not worth it.  I have minor gripes and groans about this game such as lack of certain characters and certain characters being in the game in general but those don't deter from this being a good game.  I would advise not buying this game unless things change.  Don't support companies snuffing off platforms or abandoning not even a year old game.","January 22","false","23.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

I love MK, grew up with it, & I was livid with the great return of its 2009 reboot, even have the kick ♥♥♥ bookend collectors edition for PS3 & the classic arcade stick. So here I was, blowing 80$ for a game & season pass for another go to one of my favorite franchises, knowing my PC should rock it at 60 frames & I'd be sure to love it... With that said, boy was I so ♥♥♥♥ing wrong. It should be known now Wanerbrothers buissness practices for many of its PC ports is vile, & needs to be known. After putting up with the botched preload launch, awful porting with lists of techincal/ performance issiues, patiently waiting for oversized patch downloads to not even completly fix the game... Of course when I heard of the Xl netcode update with kombat pack 2, I was hopeful PC port would finally get touched up properly with the new wave of DLC to get it on par with the other versions...Now WB's & NR are taking our money & running, completly dropping future update support & DLC for the PC version... They didn't even respect the fans enough to outright publically accounce the drop of support or offer some kind of compensation, but instead have us come to that displeasure on our own findings leaving us with this broken game empty handed... Unacceptable. There are far better optimized & supported fighters on Steam, personally looking forward to Killer Instict's cross play PC port myself. So do yourself a favor (Assuming this game doesn't get picked back up & fixed) avoid it at all costs, sale or no sale, do not give them your money.","January 22","false","24.4"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

When (more like IF) they start respecting their fans as a whole across all platforms, as is deserved, then maybe it could be considered a better idea to buy their games.\nThe sad part is that lots of people like me bought the premium edition, which is by no means cheap, and most people would think that doing so would allow them some sort of special rights when it comes to DLC, usually in the form of a discount or early play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tevron_w/recommended/307780/","tevron_w","Tevron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tevron_w/","48 products in account","I will be reviewing the game and the condition of the gameplay itself. I will be comparing some elements to mortal kombat 9 in this review.\n\nMortal kombat x is based on the new generation of fighters as well the original cast that were invovled in the tournment, to participate in protecting earth realm and stopping the brotherhood of shadows.\n\nStory Mode:\n\n-Good-\n\nI liked how each of the characters in the story mode bounced off each other well. The plot was fonded interesting as the new characters made their appearance and showed what they are capable of.\n\n-Bad-\n\nWas slighty disappointed as the story left out a considerable amount of plot holes that casual players and even Mortal kombat fans could not understand. It also can be completed within a few hours of game time depending on your skills. Certain returning casts from Mortal kombat 9 are invovled in story mode but can not be used in the game. My favourite kombatant in the game is stryker, but what im complying to is, why put him in the story mode cast if hes not playable? Id rather him not appear in the story. Same goes to all kombatants. All thats doing is annoying Mortal kombat fans. For mortal kombat fans that played this mode would find each character levels confusing comparing to the MK9 story.\n\nGameplay:\n\n-Good-\n\nVery impressive as the mechanics of the game is flexiable. When choosing a character you can be able to choose 3 different play styles that go with it. That gives you enough playing time to invest on what character and style is best for you or mastering the physics of every character in the game itself. More than happy with how the game is trying to do something different through the mortal kombat series. Fresh, brand new game. The graphics and the fatalities in this game is the best so far from the series and the graphics are on point. The Krypt mode is amazing. A whole new adventre unlocking things in the game and getting jump scares while exploring. Impressed with the design of the mode.\n\n-Bad-\n\nFactions is beyond the most pointless thing they ever tried to put into the game. Why create this feature in the game if you can use any chracters that are apart of their own affiliation? For example Sonya Blade. Her background is based on special forces. Why can I use her in any faction if she is meant to be special forces? Pointless and ridiculous! Another silly thing about this game is the fact that they didnt even put a tag team mode in it. If factions are based on team work why isnt this been mode been put in the game? I was hyped for it when I heard about it before released date imagining you could use jax and sonya in tag mode on a special forces faction. Netherrealms created an achievement stating you have to jump teams and gain the right amount of experience. So how can some players be loyal to their factions if the achievements are made like this?\n\nIf you are an fan of the mk universe, you will find theirs limitations to most returning characters. Like raidens teleportations can be used only in one variations and sonya's military stance can also be used in one also.\n\n-Condition-\n\nOn release date, this game turned into a tragedy as it was almost unplayable, but months later it got patched up. Worry no more on that side of things. This game is CPU hungry so I would suggest getting the reccomended chip for the game. The netcode is not the best of things as Ive noticed delays compared to online and singleplayer. Players will always have a problem with playing smooth matches with opponents online nevertheless. Its something we have to get used too.\n\n-Conclusion-\n\nVery fun game to play and it will last for sometime. Nice to see that netherrealm is doing something different with their franchise and moving on up with the next generation of gaming. If your an Mortal kombat fan thinking to buy this I reccomend buying this on sale as theirs going to be a lot of things that will p*ss you off like:\n\n*DLC Hungry\n*Returning characters in story mode not playable\n*Plot holes in the story\n*Faction being pointless\n*limitation to some characters supermoves in each variation\n*Bad netcode\n*No tag\n\nMetascore: 76/100\nMy Rating: 65/100","September 15, 2015","false","962.4"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","28","41","0","3"

Now if I want content I will have to buy the game again?! and on a console?! Sadly I have to say I don't recommend this, even though it's one of my favorite series and want to buy the game to show them PC is a money making platform.","January 20","false","28.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badtexture/recommended/307780/","badtexture","Kill-Cam Celebrity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badtexture/","184 products in account","UPDATE:  ♥♥♥♥ this noise, Killer Instinct is here and it is GREAT!  Perfect performance on a wide range of hardware (even a nine year old Pentium), lots of customization, crossplay and crossbuy with Xbox, and DirectX 12.  This is how PC ports should be done, I'll be jumping ship to a proper fighting game now.\n--\nSummary of my review: Salt is the only feeling I have.  Avoid at all costs.\n==\n"Disgusting."  A term used for this franchise as a whole by uninformed critics, now used by me to describe a pathetic attempt at an entry.  I loved MK9, an okay port of an amazing game I sunk thousands of hours into on Xbox 360.  Tag team gameplay and lots of character variety with an interesting roster, with a decent retelling of MK1-3's storylines made for an excellent fighting game all around, one that could actually hold its own against the legendary Street Fighter IV.  Now, we have this trash that I'm almost certain Capcom will crush without even trying.\n\nFirst, we have launch, or failure thereof.  MKX is a terrible port.  Random low-res backgrounds, cardboard cutouts covering the characters in the selection screen, random stuttering and crashing, only utilizing half your cores, constant 30GB hotfixes from the crappy partial-install system, the game has been and still is a mess.  While it's better than at launch, the game's still sloppy, and NetherRealms has abandoned it altogether.  At least Injustice was fun to play locally, but this game isn't even consistent about clientside performance, letalone playing online.\n\nThen, we have the game itself.  Once again, disgusting.  QTEs make their unwelcome return from Injustice, variations attempt to add variety but ultimately divide up signature moves from characters making you pick favorites above others, fatalities are taken from quick but unnecessary finishers to long look-we're-so-edgy formalities, that aren't even impressive anymore because rather than enter a code, you can PAY for them.  It's disgusting.  Not to mention, the animations for these go so out-of-their-way for shock value that in some cases they ACTUALLY disgusted me, made me feel queasy. Yes, I'm talking about Ermac's entrail pull... why was that dragged out to a ♥♥♥♥ing minute, and why can't we get more creative and slighly-less brutal ones like Ermac's pest control from MK9?  Even for a MK game, NRS went way out-of-bounds on this one.\n\nNow you have past and present, but what about future?  Oh yeah.  THERE IS NONE.  Aside from abandoning the port, we can't even look forward to paid DLC.  Yes, not only are some of the coolest characters locked as paid DLC, and the iconic Goro available at launch behind a paywall, but some of these characters are straight-up unavailable.  WB Games' one and only response to PC owners of the game is "Want Alien?  Get a PS4, silly."\n\nWell, I have to say something positive about the game, I guess, so here goes:\n-The female characters are actually dressed now, MK2 outfits were a Godsend for MK9\n-Um... it still has Johnny Cage?\n\nTo be honest, this whole year's been a mess for this company, and they'll enjoy sitting next to themselves on a list of publishers I will NEVER consider purchasing from.  Yes, I mean it, I have NO interest in any future titles from this company and will avoid them at all costs, and I recommend that others do the same.  For all the hate EA, SquareEnix, and, ♥♥♥♥, even Ubisoft gets, it's NOTHING compared to the sheer ineptitude and customer disregard of WB Games.\n\nWant a real fighting game?  Upgrade to Windows 10, Killer Instinct has been confirmed for PC.  Street Fighter V seems like another great entry.","January 21","false","3.2"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Online is pretty garbage at the moment. I am almost certain the majority of people who would buy/bought this game would want to play Online after they are finished with the Single Player stuff, yet you can barely get into a match here. That's not even including the fact the servers have been going down constantly, and you have frame rate drops in Online even though you didn't have a single FPS drop in single player, plus the random crashes you have to deal with. Oh, they also have an exclusive map on PC for AMD users called "Dead Pixels". That map is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing sweet. I only got into games with one of my friends so far. I also got lucky to get into a couple of games with two random people. Yeah, wait until this ♥♥♥♥ port goes on sale since the Story and actual game play is fantastic, other than a few Story things I have noticed, but no spoilers. :) Otherwise, if you don't, you might want to kill yourself after you finish the Story mode because you are paying full price.

There is a wealth of worthwhile single player and multiplayer content.  The mechanical changes such as interactive environments and alternate character variations add plenty to the game.  If it gets patched into a more functional state, I'll say go for it.  If.\n\nYou see, the PC version of MKX is a car wreck.  It runs poorly, with frequent frame rate drops.  The netcode is gag-inducing, and has all but pushed away much of the community of online players.  Glitches abound, including everyone's favorite, the classic save data eraser!  Yep, after 15 hours of play, I booted up the game this afternoon to find that all of my data had been wiped for no reason.  Similar reports have been popping up for weeks, with some people experiencing this glitch on multiple occasions.  Oh well.  I'll write this one off as a lesson learned, at least until (IF) High Voltage patches it up.  Until such time, don't make the same mistake I did.\n\n5/5 Edit: So I come home from work today, cautiously excited to see if the new patch had improved the game.  LOL nope, there was no patch.

You should play Mortal Kombat X. Don't play it on the PC.\n\nTo say the game was rough at launch is an understatement. It was varying degrees of broken for many and it took them a long time to get the game into a reasonably decent shape. Some still aren't so lucky, but it at least runs passably for most now.\n\nProblem is, WB Games is continuing its well-known track record with PC games. Look up the Arkham Knight fiasco if you're not familiar with the respect they've been showing to the platform lately. The short version is that PC players who have loyally stuck with this lousy version of a great game are getting another slap in the face, because WB Games is ending support. The console versions are getting exciting new characters, a new stage, new costumes, and even a netcode patch that should make online play more pleasant.\n\nPC players are getting jack.\n\nPC support has been officially dropped. As a long time Mortal Kombat fan, this is pretty heartbreaking. Mortal Kombat X is a fantastic game and it deserves better than this. Its fans deserve better than this. The people who paid good money for a broken game only to stick with it and get abandoned by a negligent publisher deserve better than this.\n\nIf you have the ability, go buy Mortal Kombat X on a console and send an email to WB Games letting them know which version you'd rather be playing. This game deserves to be played and enjoyed, but this version, and frankly any future PC release from WB Games, is impossible to recommend. Shame on WB Games for treating its customers this poorly, and shame on NetherRealm for standing idly by as its fans get trampled on by a publisher who's dragging the good name of its series through the mud.","January 22","false","16.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Heck, i'd even be wary if you're going to play it against a friend who you can usually play games just fine with.\n\nThe story is pretty cheesy but the developers did a good job at getting the player immersed with long cutscenes that you could take part in at any second.\nThis is my first game in the Mortal Kombat series and it really does pull me into the universe.\n\nSo TL;DR:\nGame's combat is fun, only buy this for splitscreen or singleplayer, multiplayer is trash.\nNegative review because publishers dropped support after going "Ah ♥♥♥♥ it, guys.

From unplayable online netcode to memory leak crashes (two of which the EXACT same problem was with MK9 the very same piece of **** studio ported to PC and is unfixed to this day and abandoned, just like MKX. Worth mentioning that up to relase day just like in case of Arkham Knight, it was kept a secret that Netherrealm didn't even work a single byte of the PC version), this time with bonus extras such as brutally unstable framerate even on high end PCs and graphical options that change nothing and resault in the same performance on highest and lowest settings on said high end PCs. Later on it got a little better with ~half year of patches and while the multiplayer is still unplayable on any kind of competitive level because of the netcode and constantly unstable framerate and memory leak crashes, at least the singleplayer campign is playable and very enjoyable.\n\nPost-relase development history includes over 50Gb of patches that were always a step forward and two steps back that ultimately helped a TINY bit with the framerate issues but every other problem MKX suffered at relase is still present. WarnerBros of course denies it all and due to low sales (WHY? I WONDER WHY THIS GARBAGE HAS LOW SALES?!), so the amateur developers who previously worked mainly on mobile games before messing up MK9, aren't really given a budget to have any manpower to fix MKX, and after a year it's completely abandoned. Once they even managed to absolutely wipe everyone's profile back to absolute zero. I'm completely serious. All your saves, story progression and related unlocks, krypt unlocks, online profile, literally everything was deleted months(!) after relase. And pooof, there goes all your months of work. But they after 3 weeks of outrage, generously decided to unlock everything for everyone who was caught up in their 17Gb disaster patch, that got pulled back so we had to download another 17Gb of the old files, just so the later relased "fixed patch" (patch itself is supposed to the fix for god's sake are they even developers or babies throwing dogsh-t to each other laughing?!) basicly didn't change anything. Other than killing off the entire singleplayer motivation because it unlocked everything, so all the extra __ACTUALLY_WORKING___ (miracle!) singleplayer game modes became entirely pointless. I don't even mention how long this whole procedure took them from start to finish (we are talking about weeks here) and it was just the story of ONE patch, from all that included and introduced less harmful but similar problems.\n\nI feel sorry for anyone who paid full price for this on relase (including myself) and extra sorry for those who were fool enough to pre-order a season pass (what you should never do by the way). While I do not intend to pay a single cent for the season pass, it's worth mentioning that there are actually two season passes (essentially character packs with 4 in each) but Warner abandoned the PC version so much they don't even bother to relase the second season pass on it. What upsets me is that while console versions run perfectly smoothly - in an Angry Joe interview by the way Ed Boon himself personally, verbally confirmed with a wide smile PC version is going to be just as good and the MK9 disaster won't get repeated... well it's worse with MKX - a year later MKX gets a completely new netcode.\n\nWithout a word of even mentioning why, PC players aren't getting it. Of course the few faithful who still remain to support this pile of stinky crap after the developers and the publishers repeatedly spit PC players in the eye, we got a reasoning that "PC sales weren't as high as expected and isn't worth supporting".\n\nWell maybe you, dear Warner, should stop\na) employing garbage mobile game studios to work on triple A priced and complicated games.\nb) outsourcing the game of an entirely different developer to said a) zero potential amateurs.\nc) being completely silent about your outrageous performance and disrespectful customer treatment\nd) actually change c) instead of repeating it over and over through MK9, MKX and Arkham Knight, so maybe you'll reach your "expected sold copies" number in the future instead of getting a whole platform wanting to burn you down, of which situation you react to as "k we don't care about you anymore then".\ne) f--king abandoning that disaster you are responsible for and scam people out of their money with over and over and over!\n\nIf you are looking for a decent deep fighting game and you did not want to buy MKX for all the execution gore animations and sick of this: some fatalities are some are DLC. Plus if you are bad enough not to be able to press 5 buttons in order, you can also buy 1 button easy fatality DLCs which has limited use, plus costume DLCs, plus season pass that doesn't include any of this, plus season pass 2, plus "I don't want to play I just want to own" unlock everything paid DLC. Plus your game is abandoned by players (50.000 online day one, 500 a week later), I'd recommend you to buy something else, just stay the hell away from anything that is WarnerBros or NetherRealm related (including MK9, Injustice. Injustice at least "works", just nobody plays him and online is of course unplayable because of the netcode).\n\nI'd recommend Ultra Street Fighter IV over this, because it was well supported (even when it had netplay problems introduced later on, CAPCOM really pushed itself and did absolutely everything to fix it and it's better than ever now. And that was a ~4 month period of a great 7 years active lifespan of the game), or Street Fighter V getting relased this february (2016) for PS4 and PC only with cross-platform multiplayer, great netcode and perfect optimalization, just like SF4 had it all those years ago.","January 23","false","37.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

Any fighting game should always be designed to run at 60 fps. The transition between fighting and x-ray moves (60 to 30 to 60 fps ) is jarring. Also, arcade controller support is poor. I have Madcatz Sf4 Sanwa stick, which works, but when I use this and a friend uses a xbox 360 controller (w/ wireless dongle), the button configuration aren't saved to individual profiles. If I save a button config to profile 1, then another config is saved to profile 2, it doesn't let us use the profiles. If I select profile 1, then player 2 selects profile 2, the game makes me use profile 2 also. Then if i switch to profile 1, it switches player 2 to profile 1. So if you use an arcade stick, I would stay away from this game. I do like it, but.......Why no PC patch since 9/2015. This game could be so good after some balances.

I truly enjoyed this game even when others were complaining all the time about connections and lag, most of this can be explained on the users end.\n\nBut, to drop the game completely warrants disgust and outrage. Many of us MK fans would love to spend more money but as a developer you have failed us. It's worse than if we kickstarted a game because we know you spent atleast some of our hard earned money to create MKXL and now we can't even partake.\n\nIt really breaks my heart to see such a good game litterally slide down the drain because of poor decisions.\n\nEither Valve takes this down completely or all steam owners should be viable for a refund on an incomplete product.","March 12","false","129.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I feel in my opinion its a great game, with some passionate devs, this came out just about unplayable but now its pretty good to go, atleast single player and online with friends on private matches. It runs great now as well.\n\nHowever it really pains me to have a featured game on my profile lose all support for its PC platform. Kombat pack 2 was announced. No mention of changes to PC for about a couple of weeks and we only recently found out that it won't be coming via a tweet. That to me is like an Ex girlfriend dropping the relationship via a text. Its just not right for something you've spent so much time on, loving the experiences, going through the hardships of the horrible launch just to see it thrown away in the end. I feel Ed and his team at Neverealm would have this on PC if they could. I don't know for sure but its been obvious through most of last year the higher ups at Warner Bro's don't listen to a word their devs say to them nevermind the fans of their owned franchises.\n\nThis paints a picture WB are very angry with PC gaming at this moment due to the botched Arkham Knight release on steam, They do not wish to support it anymore. They thought they could get by releasing on PC with using the most cheapest Developers out there to Contract their PC ports but since they couldn't anymore and it actually required a decent investment, They've essentially pulled out of PC gaming for the forseeable future. I doubt we'll be getting Injustice 2 or anything like that. They've not given Netherealm the resources or skills to produce on PC. Ed can't just code that himself and WB are not providing for us anymore.\n\nPick this up on some CD Key site for 10 bucks with Kombat Pass 1. You'll not be giving them anymore money as you bought from a re-seller who already has provided WB with a cut for the key.","January 22","false","325.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Footsies? Gone! Hit confirming? Gone! Just about everything that makes a fighting game good? Gone! Have fun putting your opponent in the corner or being put in the corner and just senselessly mashing buttons with no chance of escape.\n\nWelcome to Mortal Kombat X for PC, one of the worst game ports I've ever played. Dozens of useless patches to help destroy your bandwidth limit and senselessly fill your hard drive. This game is fundamentally broken and is about as balanced as playing tug-of-war with 200 fat kids. I'd rather hit my own genitals with a hammer than play this game. Seriously I would even play Mortal Kombat Special Forces over this game.\n\nAwful port aside the game just isn't good. I don't know what the hell NetherRealm Studios was trying to do with this game, but I think they failed. Now you may be thinking "But this game is new, it takes time to fix!", well I can tell you right now, no amount of patching will make this game any better. It's an absolute joke of an addition to the fighting game genre. It lacks the mechanics that generally make a game good. As a long time fan of the MK series it saddens me that this game is probably the worst new game I've played in the last 2 to 3 years. I don't understand how they went from MK9 to this one.\n\nWhy do they keep hiring High Voltage Software to do their ports, this company is garbage at what they do. Their ports of MK9 and Injustice for PC were plagued by the same issues and they're still not fixed. It must be really awesome to do shoddy half-cocked work and still get paid for it. Where can I sign up, I enjoy phoning it in on a daily basis and disappointing tens of thousands of people simultaneously. I'd be perfect for them!\n\nAnyway I guess that sums it up.\n\n2/10 would not bang.\n\n\nUPDATE (JUNE 23RD 2015): This game is still terrible, I figured I would try it out again because a couple people have claimed that it doesn't lag. Well it definitely lags and the input drop is still there as well as every other issue I've mentioned in this review. There is even a new issue too! No one plays this piece of garbage besides Russians. Absolutely DO NOT BUY this game.\n\nUPDATE #2 (JANUARY 26TH 2016): PC support has officially been dropped for this game, PC will no longer receive any updates.

To be honest with you, I am not a real fan of this type of game. I do own a couple of titles (including Mortal Kombat 9) but rarely play them.\n\nWhat impressed me on my first attempt was how easy the controls (moves) were to master which to me was a massive plus. From this, I jumped into the story mode and was just blown away by this game, from the cinematic scenes to the game play!\n\nAt first, you will have to choose one of five factions to join (you will have challenges to achieve on a daily basis to help your faction ranking). After choosing one faction, you will be directed to the game menu where you will be able to select a mode of play.  You will have several options: one player, two players and online mode.\n\nEach fight you win, you will get coins (this will vary upon successful combos) which you will be able to use in the Krypt section to unlock plenty of gizmos by opening tombs. My suggestion to you is to amalgamate as many coins as possible because the krypt is fairly big and has many tombs to ravage.\n\nMortal Kombat X has absolutely splendid graphics, runs smoothly and the controls are easy to master.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Splendid cinematic scenes (story mode)\n-	Great control system\n-	Very addictive\n-	 Plenty of achievements\n-	Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Big download but well worth it\n\nFun, addictive, visually grandiose, just a cracker of a fighting game!\n\n10/10\n\nMORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HERE\n\nFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE","April 19, 2015","true","21.0"," 105 of 185 people (57%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","57","105","185","11","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightmare857/recommended/307780/","nightmare857","Krocomire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightmare857/","81 products in account","I would never recommend this game, even to someone I didn't like.\n\nThe problems start with the utter laziness that went into porting this game to the PC.  There is no excuse for poor optimization,  poor hardware support, and the poor netcode for this game.   This game wasn't ported by some unknown company using some unknown engine.  This game was ported by High Voltage Software ,a veteran in the world of video games, on the unreal engine, one of the most flexible game engines ever made.  It is unconscionable that people who exceed the recomended requirements for this game still have trouble running it after all this time.\n\nEven getting past the technical issues the story itself has a lot of issues.  The most glaring of which is the way the younger generation is portrayed.  They are all arrogant self centered tough talking paper tigers who achieve their goals not through hard work and preparedness but simply because they want to real hard.  The new "bad guys" that are introduced are far more likable than the aforementioned paper tiger protagonists.\n\nEven a mediocre story can be forgiven if the game play is good enough.  Sadly that is not the case here.  There are two major problems with the game play (three if you are an avid online player).\n\nThe first problem is the execution of the variations system.  A character's special moves are divided up by variation.  So no matter which variation you pick you always are playing as an incomplete version of that character.  I do think that the idea of variations is good because it adds a tactical element to your choice in play style.  Variations should be made by buffing certain moves not by buffing some and taking other moves away.\n\nThe second major game play issue is the fighting itself.  When the game first came out the fighting was ok.  It allowed multiple playing styles where the outcome of the fight was not decided superior style but by the player's own skill in using their respective styles.  The fighting aspect of the game has been slowly eroded to favor one particular style of play.  This has happened because the developers gave into the many complaints with incorrectly and overly used terms like balance, over powered, broken character, not competitive, and spam.  So instead of fixing major technical issues and glitches we got nerfed characters.\n\nThe third problem is the netcode.  For someone with my playstlye and skill level the netcode is only minor annoyance but for someone who uses the "Footsy EVO" style of game play ,who have invested a lot of time into this game,  the sudden frame drops  would be devastating.\n\nThe most tragic thing about this game is that despite all of it's short comings Mortal Kombat  X is still a good game.   Even if  like me you are irritated by all of things I mentioned above you can still have fun playing the many different game modes and unlocking collectibles.  Now WB games and NetherRealm studios have decided to no longer support the PC platform.  This means no more bug fixes and the future DLC and additional content has been canceled.  This is another in a long list of unintelligent and dishonorable decisions by WB games.  I urge you to not only not purchase this game, but not to purchase anything attached to WB games.  This is going to be hard but if you support WB games you are supporting  the idea that Publishers and developers can make this unfinished crap, treat their customers poorly , and people will buy it anyway.  If WB games and NetherRealm studios ever stops pouting,  puts their big boy pants on, owns up to and fixes their mistakes I would be glad to support them again.  In the event that hell freezes over and they actually do then I will edit this review and admit I was wrong.\n\n","January 31","false","84.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightmare857/recommended/307780/","nightmare857","Krocomire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightmare857/","81 products in account","I would never recommend this game, even to someone I didn't like.\n\nThe problems start with the utter laziness that went into porting this game to the PC.  There is no excuse for poor optimization,  poor hardware support, and the poor netcode for this game.   This game wasn't ported by some unknown company using some unknown engine.  This game was ported by High Voltage Software ,a veteran in the world of video games, on the unreal engine, one of the most flexible game engines ever made.  It is unconscionable that people who exceed the recomended requirements for this game still have trouble running it after all this time.\n\nEven getting past the technical issues the story itself has a lot of issues.  The most glaring of which is the way the younger generation is portrayed.  They are all arrogant self centered tough talking paper tigers who achieve their goals not through hard work and preparedness but simply because they want to real hard.  The new "bad guys" that are introduced are far more likable than the aforementioned paper tiger protagonists.\n\nEven a mediocre story can be forgiven if the game play is good enough.  Sadly that is not the case here.  There are two major problems with the game play (three if you are an avid online player).\n\nThe first problem is the execution of the variations system.  A character's special moves are divided up by variation.  So no matter which variation you pick you always are playing as an incomplete version of that character.  I do think that the idea of variations is good because it adds a tactical element to your choice in play style.  Variations should be made by buffing certain moves not by buffing some and taking other moves away.\n\nThe second major game play issue is the fighting itself.  When the game first came out the fighting was ok.  It allowed multiple playing styles where the outcome of the fight was not decided superior style but by the player's own skill in using their respective styles.  The fighting aspect of the game has been slowly eroded to favor one particular style of play.  This has happened because the developers gave into the many complaints with incorrectly and overly used terms like balance, over powered, broken character, not competitive, and spam.  So instead of fixing major technical issues and glitches we got nerfed characters.\n\nThe third problem is the netcode.  For someone with my playstlye and skill level the netcode is only minor annoyance but for someone who uses the "Footsy EVO" style of game play ,who have invested a lot of time into this game,  the sudden frame drops  would be devastating.\n\nThe most tragic thing about this game is that despite all of it's short comings Mortal Kombat  X is still a good game.   Even if  like me you are irritated by all of things I mentioned above you can still have fun playing the many different game modes and unlocking collectibles.  Now WB games and NetherRealm studios have decided to no longer support the PC platform.  This means no more bug fixes and the future DLC and additional content has been canceled.  This is another in a long list of unintelligent and dishonorable decisions by WB games.  I urge you to not only not purchase this game, but not to purchase anything attached to WB games.  This is going to be hard but if you support WB games you are supporting  the idea that Publishers and developers can make this unfinished crap, treat their customers poorly , and people will buy it anyway.  If WB games and NetherRealm studios ever stops pouting,  puts their big boy pants on, owns up to and fixes their mistakes I would be glad to support them again.  In the event that hell freezes over and they actually do then I will edit this review and admit I was wrong.\n\n","January 31","false","84.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I had some good memories ofplaying the older games as a kid, and I some fun with MK9, but was a bit disappointed with the balance of the game.\n\nSo, I preorder this game. It looked well polished, great graphics and sound, smooth looking gameplay, tons of content, it had it all right? The launch was shaky at best. NRS tried a "streaming download" system with this game, where you downloaded the game in parts, and could play it as soon as it downloaded the parts necessary for gameplay. It's imilar to Blizzard's  system in that respect, except it didn't work. I'm going to largely ignore the launch issues here, because they were fixed pretty soon, even if they left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nSo, game finishes installing finally, and I hope online after a bit of practicing combos. I'm greeted with the most unplayably laggy online fighting game experience of my entire life. I am talking a solid 2 seconds of delay here. After a few more matches, all ending the same way, I decide to play some story mode. To be fair, the story is pretty fun, and well done for a fighting game.\n\nI decided to wait until the port was fixed, with the lag issues and a nasty memory leak being present. I kind of forgot about the game for a while until I saw some cool Jason and Predator DLC matches on youtube. I figured "Hey, the port has been out a while, they probably fixed the problems right?", no they didn't.\n\nNot only was the game still a mess, but NRS decided that they would completely abandon development of the PC version of the game, and it would no longer recieve any patches or DLC. This for me was the last straw. I'm personally never supporting NRS or WB games on PC  again until they can prove to me that they deserve respect as a developer on the platform.\n\nDo yourself a favour, save yourself a headache, and buy a game that actually works like Guilty Gear or Street Fighter.\n\nsolid 3/10 (story is alright)","February 28","false","10.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Although the PC port is a bit sloppy, I haven't experienced any of the bugs I see mentioned. However, after purchasing MK:X for $60 and all of the DLC for a total of about $100, expecting to drop another $30-40 on the "XL" version, only to be informed that MK:X on the PC is being dropped by the developers. According to most sources, there will be absolutely ZERO SUPPORT for the PC version from now onwards. Perhaps this would be acceptable if the price reflected the quality, but it does not. Honestly, I would give a thumbs up if it weren't for this blatant spit in the face of those of us who purchased this for PC.

There are still jumpscares though. Addictively fun Minigames Beautiful soundtracksMore fatalities/BrutalitiesFighter selection perfected!! 10/10 - What amazes me about this is that each characters have unique animations and thats good!\n[/h1]Variations! 10/10[/h1]\nFighters' conversations/intros - THIS is what a true fighting game must be! It's impossible that all characters have intros and outros! It's really really good feature and MUST be in every fighting game! It just have to be!\nBAD:\nNew characters are horrible - They're disgusting. Why don't you just add the characters from the previous MK games?? That idea would be much better than having those teen titan pieces of ♥♥♥♥. They've also killed the iconic original kombatants. We have this Ferra/Torr, Erron Black and Kotal Kahn. Why are they on MK??? Why do we need such characters like this instead of the MK theme style? If I were you I'd just add characters from previous MK games...\nFPS low - MK9 rans in a flash, but just 4 years later this piece of ♥♥♥♥ rans about 10-15.\nCharacter designs - What the ♥♥♥♥ happened to Ermac's body, Mileena's disgusting mouth, topless junkie ♥♥♥♥♥ Shinnok & Quan Chi? Back in time when playing MK4, it was the really a nightmare horror. Even Shinnok & Quan Chi were scary and their brutal fatalities that I can't play the game alone. I admit it, I hate all the characters' designs, just LOOK AT THEM!\nBad PC port -Microtransactions - Is it just me or the developers begin to grow to EA? Of all previous games, Goro is now a DLC character??\nUnrealistic fatalities - Jax The Ribber, Selfie, etc\nGuest characters - Why? Just why? After Freddy Krueger was released in MK9 I really hoped they won't do this mistake ever again. Oh they did, along with Jason, Predator and that chainsaw guy.\nNo stage fatalitiesNo new characters - I WANT MY ♥♥♥♥IGN TRIBORG! I always love robots since when I was a kid! My mouth died of watering down of Triborg's appearence on consoles but not PC!\nWB Games -Lack of stages- The amount of content, DLCs & microtransactions added and the price, I'd say 13 arenas are really, really not enough. MK9 has a whopping 26 arenas!\nShadowy game design concept - Before this game came out, MKX is EXACTLY what I thought it to be. ♥♥♥♥ing shadow everywhere. You know what I mean? Everything's so shadowy, even wallpapers, not colorful and beautiful like from MK9.\nBad story mode - I just don't like it. At all.\nNo returning features - There is still no kreate your fighter, kreate fatality, or mini games from Injustice (because QTE ♥♥♥♥ing sucks a@@)\nMK XL - Not enough whoring for money huh? It pretends to be 'complete pack' but actually you have to pre-order it again to get more costumes.\nCompanion app- It destroyed my productivity just to get Injustice Scorpion skin, during the process it looked like I've wasted my life to get the skin because they've stopped support MK. Meanwhile, they just want more money. Each new character card cost $19.99\nPC support - As of January 16, developers officially stated that there will be no support for this game & no KP2 for the PC version. Why? Why? This doesn't make sense! I've been waiting for this forever and it's broke my heart. And why the ♥♥♥♥ did it take so much time for 4 characters to work?  Complete game is 40.3 GB - Are you kidding me? 40 gigabyte is almost GTA V size, and the game even lacks of arenas! Just a fighting game, facing one's opponent, not open world... It would be a great idea if you add a downloadable option 'Krypt' because of its unnecesary graphics and laggy FPS.\n\nF.Y.I: I watched a little bit of MKX instead of buying it, but then later bought it. This is what I expected for this piece of ♥♥♥♥. I prefer MK9. I don't know what they're onto but they've turned from tiny trustful company to EA. Greedier than ever. I want to add the worst and disappointing support ever of 21st century. The same of what PAYDAY 2 developers did to us. Treating us like terrorists. I'm disappointed as ♥♥♥♥ing hell, Ed.\nDon't be an idiot by the way, if you want to be smart, just buy MK9. It has good story mode, graphics, larger roster and colorful instead of just shadow I mentioned before.\nMK9 FTW\n\n4.8/10\nFATALITY","January 22","false","62.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

These few negatives actually made me stop playing the game for a decent amount of time due to sheer frustration.\n\n- Terrible online matchmaking capabilities for PC\n- Constantly paired against opponents with high ping\n- The game doesn't integrate a feature to explain mechanics to new players (this isn't a negative for myself, but for many...)\n- Overwhelming lack of bug fixes/connection issues\n\nThe inability to play multiplayer fluidly is definitely what turned me off of this game. If you are thinking of purchasing this game for a dynamic multiplayer experience, purchase something else because this will be a huge waste of time and money for you, and it sure was for me.","June 12, 2015","false","39.5"," 62 of 107 people (58%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","58","62","107","7","4"

I started with MK2 back when i was 7 years old. I grew up with MK. This game isn't the worst MK, seeing as we have abominations like armageddon and MK Gold in our past, but it's certianly a huge waste from a team i know can do better.\n\nCommands still randomly drop, you'll not perform a combo because that game sometimes doesn't feel like it. Fighting otherwise feels pretty meh. It's more like injustice than MK9 to be quite honest and i don't consider that to be a good thing.\n\nThe unlock system is totally and completely busted. The Krypt is now a maze with jumpscare QTEs and multiple branching paths. So what used to be a simple task is now a chore.\n\nThe story mode is back, and the story is in a word: Boring.  It tells of shinnok's return, but from the perspective of a bunch of newbies no one cares about and are presented as unlikably as possible, or from Johnny and Sonya's perspective. Everyone cool is a quan chi wraith.\n\nThere's multiple unplayable fighters in the game, such as Rain, Tanya(!) Sindel, This presents the game as a bad value. An unfinished "Starter pack" of a game you have to pay to unlock at a later date. I don't know about you, but when I buy something, say a cookie, i don't want hald the chocolate chips picked out then sold to me for 25 cents extra and delivered next week when the cookie's all hard and stale. This game is extremely spendy. Buy costumes, Buy Characters, But Easy fatality tokens, Buy this, Buy that, Instead, just don't buy the game.\n\nSo let's say, you don't have a problem with any of that. You can deal with the dropped combos, Locked on-disc characters don't bother you, And DLC? Bah! All games are doing it. Fine then slick. Game randomly CTDs for virtually no reason at all. I have a more stable gaming experience with a modded up the wazoo skyrim than i do MKX. I don't think i've ever seen an unmodded game crash so much. Despite my drivers being the latest version and the game being updated almot daily it seems, the game still crashes like a drunk driving a bumpercar.\n\nThis is not even by FAR the worst mortal kombat. That would be unchained on PSP. Or maybe trilogy on tiger Game.com handheld(google it). Or maybe even the tiger electronics card swipe Mortal Kombat handheld LCD game. But this game is in NO WAY worth 60 dollars, let alone 80 for the full version. More like the Fools Version. If you can pick this game up 3 years after the fact at christmas for 20 bucks, Hey you got yourself a good deal. Maybe they'll even fix the game by then! But as it stands, it's a stinking pile of garbage.","April 19, 2015","false","10.2"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

A majority number discarded the game due to its ♥♥♥♥♥♥ porting at launch, and the faithful that remained til now were treated to a discontinued service--on the PC of course.\n\nPut out something in poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥ quality to make a quick profit and when people get upset about said poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥ quality, use the outrage as justification to cut and run with the money you made, because how dare people want something that works good right? That is Warner Bros and Netherrealm Studios. When they actually have to put effort into making and maintaining a good functioning PC port, they simply can't do it so they just drop it like it's hot. The condom broke, you have their baby, but they will no longer pay child support. It's your problem, you deal with it.\n\nOh and the game remains on steam for full price btw with the $100+ total dlc (One of which is to just unlock everything already in the game) even though its been completely dropped for support. Its no longer worth spending money on to update, but it will remain here for any idiots that still want to give us money for a discontinued product. $60-150 for a discontinued product.\n\nPlease dont buy this game on steam--preferrably not at all because its rather disgusting to think of supporting a company like that when they can be so openly terrible repeatedly and get away with it. Had i have known this was going to happen only a month after owning it i most assuredly wouldnt have bought it. I uninstalled it and i will most likely not be playing it again anytime soon if at all.","February 17","false","29.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","2"

I will not reccomend to buy at any price and will severly be hindered in purchasing anything from Warner Brothers and Nether Realm Studios in the future for any platform.   IF I could get my money back for this title I would in a heartbeat but I am extremely past the return date on this product.  Also I would recommend that steam should go as far as to remove this title for sale and stand up to the studio for the gamers that use steam, like they did for a previous Batman title that was so awful that they removed it for sale through steam.   The Batman title was also a Warner Brothers title, so this studio has shown alot of disregard for the pc gamer.","February 20","false","14.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","2"

Amazing game. But this port to PC is just beyond horrific and the launch of this game was beyond terrible. Don't get me wrong. I would buy this game a thousand times over...for consoles that is.\n\nFirst off, the port to PC...Even with grand specs, my computer can not run it without some hiccups. The best I can do is run it on 800x600 resolution with low quality, which gives me a steady fps. The x-rays are 30 fps, which i don't mind. What I do mind is suddenly when you do an x-ray, you notice that visual drop in fps.\n\nNow, the launch of this game on April 14...I was one of the ones that pre-ordered the game in hopes of it being a superior port to its predecessor (MK9). I pre-loaded the ~3 GB "game" and it asked me to download 29 DLC packages/patches. I looked at their explanation and it said you can play the game as it downloads, but do the developers not know that you can't download while in a game on steam? Of course they do. My guess is that, really the developers were not ready for a full release of the PC port on April 14.\n\nSlyly disguising an incomplete port in the form of DLC patches, they managed to sneak in the fact that DLC patches #5 and #9 were oddly missing from the full package on release day. And of course major features were missing such as story mode, faction mode, and general online play on release day. Furthermore is the fact that on April 18, a 15 GB "Patch" was uploaded. A 15 GB "patch"? You might as well call that half of the game. I rest my case that this game was never ready on release day and was never meant to be released before it was ready. Even with the 15 GB patch, there are features missing. The netcode is still horrible. People lag out of online matches, especially King of the Hill.\n\nI understand turning this into a PC port is a quick buck, and hell you got my money. Even for the DLC, you got my money. But none of the DLC characters are actually available yet... The MK games are notorious for  bad PC ports. I mean, just look at the reviews for the MK series on steam. Just bad ports all over the place. This game is another shoddily coded Mortal Kombat game and has let me down. High Voltage, I understand you're work-for-hire developers, but just stop hustling PC gamers if you're going to do a shoddy job of a port.","April 18, 2015","false","6.6"," 32 of 52 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","32","52","3","2"

The first time I did this, I was pretty upset. The game had a disasterous launch on PC if anyone remembers. Since then, some time has passed and, more importantly, some critical patches have come out. Here goes...\n\nFirst off, I am a fan of the MK series, been playing em since MK3. I think that MKX is a pretty good fighting game. The characters and variations are diverse and interesting. The game, in my opinion, is balanced well. The graphics are great especially in regards to character models and backgrounds. The fighting is fluid and has good animations. The story is serviceable. Its no Mass Effect, but I found it interesting(minus the stupid QTE). People who haven't played MK before should have no trouble understanding whats going on. Besides the story, you got stuff like klassic towers, test your might, etc. The Krypt also makes a comeback if you are into that kinda thing. They made it sorta like a minigame which I found to be ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. You have to run around and solve little puzzles to unlock regions with chests. Summing up, I would give this game an 8/10.\n\nSo why do I not recommend it then? ONLINE MULTIPLAYER. Yes ladies and gentlemen, even after all the ♥♥♥♥♥ing and the patching, it still doesn't work properly. The lag simply makes online play impossible. This isn't some 3-5 frame lag like in USF4, your character behaves as if he/she injected 100cc of morphine and is struggling to stay awake. Simple combos that I can pull off with my eyes closed in practice cannot be performed online due to the lag. Multiplayer is such an important thing to get right in a fighting game. If you look at my "time played", 90% of that time I spent in practice/story/towers. The other 10% I was trying my best to play online. This usually defaulted to: play a couple of matches, get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the lag, toss my controller across the room and turn the ♥♥♥♥ing game off. Matches are starting to take longer and longer to find. The rooms are pretty much empty most of the time except for Brazil for some reason.\n\nSo basically, unless you want to play against the computer, don't buy this game. As for me, its a little late to get a refund xD. I'm definately not buying anything from Neatherealm on PC again though and same thing goes for those ♥♥♥♥ers at High Voltage.","June 1, 2015","false","85.7"," 26 of 41 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","26","41","0","0"

Sure there's 3 other characters in the pack but screw them, I wanna rip the predator apart with an Alien, it will be utterly glorious and I'm already heading to my steam wallet to get my £30 ready to pre-order the pack.\n\nImagine then if you will be sheer gut wrenching disapoitment I then feel when I happen across the discussion page and find out that the second pack won't be coming to PC, as well as no further balance patches or any support what so ever for that matter. No I thought, someone has it wrong, its a trick or an early April fools prank but no, a quick browse on Google confirmed that WB and NRS have abandoned us PC users and are instead only concentrating on the console versions.\n\nYou see, for as good as the game is, and it really is, everytime they update or patch it in any way they always seem to break something else, save files disapearing into the Netherealm (pun intended), buggy online, krypt crashes  or glitches galore so I can only assume they that this time they thought 'screw it, it's just about playable as it is, why break it yet again and go through the whole umpteen patches a month m'larky until we get it half right'\n\nNow don't get me wrong, the game is really good, its a solid fighter with some great mechanics, characters and really brutal finishing moves, its a fantastic addition to MK series but I just condone us PC users getting screwed over yet again. I still have a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth from the bugfest that was Batman Arkham Knight (another WB game) and just when you start getting around the idea of forgiving them they pull a stunt like this, its just not on. I've paid my dues (about £70 worth of dues) so why should I have to miss out on extra content consoles are getting because the devs are too lazy and too incompetent to get it right, its DOA Last Round all over again, another great fighter ruined by the crappy porting standards we seem to suffer alately.\n\nThe only way we will get our voices heard is through our wallets, my advice is don't buy this game, these crooked developers will only learn if we stop giving them money for their half as*ed work, maybe one day we'll get a working product day one that won't be later abandoned due to laziness.\n\nStreet Fighter V is only around the corner now and its looking more and more possible each day that Namco are going to give us Tekken 7 on PC this year too, combine that with the other great fighters that are already out on Steam and you won't be missing much if you pass this one up, we didn't spend all this money on our rigs to be treat like second class citizens.","January 21","false","32.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Easy to play, hard to master.\n- Quite a bit of content if you include online..\n\nCons:\n- Online is still not where it needs to be. (Netcode is still crap)\n- Some crashing and ridiculous stutter randomly on a certain map\n- WB and NR Studios have abandoned it!\n\nI purchased the game on day one, after going to a pre-launch Launch Tournament and playing it first-hand. The game was fun and seemed to even beat MK9. I even bought the Kombat Pack.. But that was local-play on a PS4. When I tried playing it on my PC.. Well..\n\nThe original download was botched horribly. I had to re-download it multiple times because of the delivery system it used not working properly. After that, my Goro pre-order bonus mysteriously disappeared and I had to purchase it separately! Then, as expected with multiplayer games these days I guess, the netcode was a joke. Online connection was constantly iffy, and most of the time either crashed or put you in a match with slide-show style lag.\n\nFast-forward to present-day.. The netcode still doesn't work as it should, and the developer and publisher have decided to abandon the PC port altogether. Once again, a genuinely fun game has been ruined by either laziness or straight up shady business practices. Not to mention the $30 Kombat Pack including only a few characters and minor things.. It's ridiculous.\n\nDo not purchase at full-price, and for that matter, do not purchase on PC. WB seems incapable of LETTING A GAME FINISH DEVELOPMENT BEFORE LAUNCH.","January 22","false","19.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"
