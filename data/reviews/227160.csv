Once I deciphered it I saw enough promise in the idea to purchase a second copy for a friend.\n\nThe game was flawed but it was Early Access. Lots of things didn't work as expected.  Some things didn't work at all.  There was little correspondence between the sparse documentation and game play.   I put the game's developement somewhere between late Alpha and early Beta.\n\nThen, almost without warning, Kinetic Void went to full release.  The broken parts were still broken.  The unfinished parts were still unfinished.  The devs claimed they had delivered what they had promised but that they would clean up the remaining rough edges.\n\nSeveral months  later the edges are still as rough as they were at _release_.\n\nShip building works well enough but there is a lack of detail.  All components engines, turrets, hull, weapons have a generic, unfinished feel.  The mission system doesn't work but combat mostly does work.  Trade & inventory management are overly complex and nearly indecipherable.   Movement & control work but the interface is inconsistent.\n\nThe Devs are a small team.  Apparently there are only three of them yet theyconsistently  have ignored offers of help from the community.\n\nPerhaps it's project burn-out.  Perhaps the devs will find a second wind and, with a mighty effort,  put a playable game together.  I wouldn't count on it.\n\nPut your money somewhere else.\n\nTwo sad thumbs down.","January 24, 2015","false","152.5"," 609 of 623 people (98%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","98","609","623","8","6"

Given that it was early access I decided I'd wait a bit, see if they managed to turn it into something actually worth playing. Well it's been a while since then, and guess what? Not at all what they promised... The only improvements they've made were incrimental or pointless. Moreover, the devs have attempted to silence negative reviews on numerous occasions.

It was obviously pushed out too early considering part of the "finished game" has "(Not currently implemented)" placeholders.  Development was chugging along, albeit slow, but most folks knew that when they were getting into the game...and could forgive that easily.\n\nThe main problem isn't the gameplay to be found in the game, as it has a decent foundation with a ship builder and more (almost like a 3D Drox Operative)...but outside of that, there really isn't much to the game still, and unfortunately due to developer meltdown there probably never will be.\n\nThis is another Early Access dud where they slap a 1.0 on it (to cash in on the sales that might generate...which it did not), expect the community to finish it, then spend time making excuses about how Steam wouldn't allow them to put it back into the Early Access program while lashing out at their customers for not crowdfunding someone's dream and being happy about the results when it was prematurely released with poor communication surrounding it.\n\nThat is exactly what LumberingTroll (developer) did, and when people pointed this out in a thread asking if the game was still being developed - after the dev wasn't communicating with the community shortly after the "Spacebase Treatment" of slapping a 1.0 on a title then bailing to start up a physical game store without letting those following the game know what was going on in dev plans - LumberingTroll called everyone "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥" and then deleted the thread when it appeared that he might have to face responsibility for his own actions.\n\nYes, apparently game developers - the REAL Steam customers while everyone else is supposed to be happy with poor faith business practices - are allowed to break the Steam posting rules whenever they feel like it and can only be held "responsible" by deleting the incriminating evidence from the virtual sandbox Steam gives them to do whatever to the "lesser customers" - also known as "marks" - only when it embarrasses them.\n\nThe problem with that is that people were otherwise mostly forgiving up until the "Spacebase Treatment" and the childish forum whitewashing.\n\nYou thought you had a problem with "bad reviews" before, LumberingTroll?\n\nYou just gave people reason to write more.\n\nMaybe next time you'll bother to treat your customers in the same respect you wish to be treated, but until this developer does some serious reparations I would suggest to avoid the developer's dysfunction at all possibilities.  Those antics changed my position from a silent "wouldn't recommend until it becomes more complete" to a "until this developer removes their head from their backside, continuing to pay attention to them might in itself deserve a refund".\n\nLumberingTroll:\n"You are all being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and this is why most developers refuse to reply on forums.\n\nKV was released early, yep, nothing new ive said that before. Valve wont let me put it back in early access so there is nothing I can do about that. KV isn't generating money, I cant put funds into its development right now, I work on it when I can in my spare time. I am hoping we (the two people still at the company) can put out a small project to generate some revenue to fund development. Like it or not the game is as it is for now. I'm sorry some of you feel your $5 - $20 was wasted. If you guys dont want to be civil I'll gladly just avoid the forums from now on like most developers do."\n\nBlame the customer?  The customer writes reviews to that effect.\n\nEdit 26 Apr 15:\nScreenshot of developer banning someone for reporting the developer's comment for being in violation of the Steam Rules:  http://imgur.com/nyzSXdj\n\nScreenshot of developer asking for feedback about why customer reviews were so negative: http://i.imgur.com/EmJ9cPV.png\n\nSomeone gives the developer this info (long after the dev bailed from the title except for excuses), to which the developer disagreed enough that they deleted the entire thread:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8vcRzdl.png\n\nEdit 30 Nov 15:\nLT continues his practise of whitewashing the forum of his misdeeds, namely running off to go start a physical game store after blowing a substantial amount of the Kickstarter on his Steam library, while those who point this out whenever LT plays up the "barely able to scrape by starving developer" farce get permabanned and purged from the forums:\nhttp://imgur.com/0P092rk\n\nHere is an article describing where the remaining funds for developing KV went to:\nhttp://www.argusleader.com/story/news/business-journal/2015/08/11/badland-games-caters-board-game-players/31505761/","March 27, 2015","false","0.4"," 149 of 157 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","149","157","5","45"

I enjoyed it. now fast forward a year and what do we have? A much better product then it used to be. the combat system is much more polished, The ship builder is exellent now. and The galaxy is more populated then it used to be, seriously, if you look at a game and it says "Full release" Its not full, its never full. The developers pushed it into full release because they needed the money to continue working on the game to make it better. Players like me who spend their time creating ships and such treasure this game. You do realise that these Devs cannot afford everything? Its an extremely small team and I applaud them for making it this far without giving up.\n\nPeople who say the UI is bad: The game was made in unity.

My first Early-release, too.\n\nI was an active part of the community at the time, doing screenshots and showing off ships, complementing eachothers' ships, writing guides, giving feedback to the developers.\n\n6 months later I grew tired of the slow updating (as well as the game) so I stopped playing it as actively as I once was. 3 months after that I stopped completely.\n\nI patiently waited for new updates that came once per 3-4 months at a time sometimes, and briefly brought myself to speed with how things were.\n\nThen they began to rush the release. I could tell because they suddenly sped up the alpha states faster than the content actually generated. From .022 to a .#, and then to simply d.#, like they were trying to rename the process to give the illusion of progress. Then the release came. I, like many other backers, was immensly disapointed with the game.\n\nWhile real progress was made in these 2 years, the progress could have easily fit into one year.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the shipbuilder is GREAT. Or, at least last time I checked.\n\nBut then you're in space. It can get really laggy, and there isn't much to do. I don't mind having all the lore of the universe in your head, but developers promised economy systems, intricate faction mechanics, ect. Nothing is intricate.\n\nEven if this was still in alpha I would give a shaky reccomendation at best.

The recommendation remains negative though.\n\nThe first thing you'll be asked to do when starting a new game is to choose a mode (career - which means you start with limited resources and have to acquire more to build bigger ships - and creation - which means you have access to nearly an infinite amount of parts). Sadly for the career mode there is only 3 starting option, start with a small fighter or a freighter and the last being no ship but with some random part in your stock which sometimes produce quite awkward results. You will then set the size of the galaxy and how many factions inhabits it as well as name it (this is actually your save).\n\nThe core of the game is the ship design/building. You have several parts of several types which you can use and they come in various sizes (with some blocks shapes that are specific to a size or another). Once you build your "hull" and depending on how many parts of this or that type you set, you have space to put subsystems. Weapons are set on hardpoints which you also set by placing those weapon mounts. Overall the system is nice and as long as you remain in the hangar, lighting and controls are manageable.\n\nThe UI is sometimes a bit annoying as you can get menus overlapping each others. To give an example, when you have the parts panel open and go to the shop, the parts panel has priority over the shop one which does not make much sense as obviously when you open the shop you ain't going to build your ship. Another example are the pop up windows when you place modules which may happen partially off-screen. Those are details and are easily sorted (as you can close the side panel of part directly or drag the windows) but it shows an unfinished or unpolished state of the game.\n\nOnce you launch your ship, that is when the state of the game really shows. The first shocking thing that struck me is the lighting. While lighting is kind of realistic (light source = sun) and background is pretty dark (nebular clouds are also pretty dark) it often leads you to barely seeing your own ship or which direction she's headed.\n\nThere are several promising features in this game, although it is difficult to get involved. Mining is the first thing I tried to do and while it is easy to grasp and do, it is not fun. You select an asteroid, warp to it at range, bring the context menu again to mine and then... well, you wait till either the asteroid is destroyed or your cargo is full. I returned to the station I came from by warping to it and hoped to find a docking option in the contextual menu while having it selected, but you have to manoeuver manually in the "docking line" first and then on approach you get to confirm you want to dock.\n\nOnce docked with your cargo you of course hope to sell it. So first you need to transfer the cargo from your ship to the station and then you may trade it. When trading, you click on each goods and then select a quantity you want to sell. There are little option to accelerate this process like "shift-click" to sell all of a good.\n\nI won't detail combat or faction interractions here, although my overall experience of those features was that they were pretty bland. Of course I did not play enough in career mode to fully appreciate the content of late game like having tons of parts and a huge vessel for example. You can surely experience that directly with the creation mode, although my feeling is that if you're not solely an avid ship builder this will kind of work like a cheat and chances are that you will roll over everything else in the game once you launch your masterdesign and subsequently loose interest in doing anything else in the game very quickly (there is no story to uncover and generally speaking nothing that gives you a real sense of accomplishing anything anyway).\n\nAs I said above regarding mining there is this feeling that the game does not make the player participate actively to the things he can do and at the same time make actions available to him sort of chores. It is not a that much of a bad game, but the unfinished state sadly end up with this product being mediocre (this is apparently explained by half the studio workforce, 2 on 4, having left the project). I would like to see it updated and apparently that is also the opinion of the remaining employees, but everyone's got to eat and I can't blame gamers for not buying this leading to the makers having to work on something that is actually economically sustainable.","October 11, 2015","false","32.3"," 85 of 91 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","85","91","0","8"

These are my thoughts.\n\nI find that many improvements have indeed been made.  This is to be expected, and very much welcomed.  I find that many of the features such as the shipyard and flight models have been improved with more easy-to-use controls and additional features.  A quick rundown of some of the key features and improvements I noticed:\n* Better inter/intra-system navigation and map\n* Slightly improved combat gameplay\n* Improved flight model and warp systems\n* Missions, Cargo, and semi-functional stores\n* Semi-functional "career" mode.  More on this below.\n\nSome things that are still issues:\n* Not developer's fault, but many workshop ships no longer function out-of-the-box due to creators failing to update them for new patches.\n* Overall, game still feels quite clunky and difficult to use.  Somewhat high learning curve unless you're wiling to read a lot.\n>> Documentation has been improved.  Just be prepared for lots of reading.\n* Crash to desktop is common.  Crashes more as your ship's # of modules increase\n>> Relatively decent auto-save means you won't loose too much progress.\n* See more below\n\nThe game is still quite confusing and you often still don't even know what's going on.  There's still a lot left to be desired I think.\n\nOverall, the game has improved. Though I can't say that this is something to get especially excited about.  "Why are you being such a debbie downer" you ask?  Well, it's an alpha.  It is SUPPOSED to improve.  If it didn't, it's not worthy of even being sold.\n\nI still do not recommend this game.  There is a "But" however... Here are my thoughts\n\nMany critical features have been added and improved to a more usable state.  The warp mechanism has been tremendously improved.  The shipyard build system also deserves a mention as a vast improvement.  More customizability and more controls to fine tune your construction.  Though this can make things a bit more confusing to the new person or returning player, as with some of the other expanded features.  This is made up for with the improved documentation.  But beware, decent amounts of reading is required.  There are also some tweaks and improvements to the combat system.  It makes more sense but can still be awkward.  The galaxy map has also gotten a big makeover and is MUCH easier to understand.\n\nThere are many things that still are confusing and unfinished in this game.  The "career" mode is clearly unfinished and requires more attention.  From what I can tell, it's a misleadingly named "survival" mode at the moment.  However, it fails at that as well.  You have credits and the idea is to earn more through cargo or more "illigitimate" means. Basically, you start out by picking ANY ship from the workshop or stock selections.  No cost.  If you run out of money buying cargo to load into your mega-freighter you downloaded and didn't have to pay for, then just select any of the ship-part categories and sell any number of the "999" parts you somehow own from the start.  Just sell a couple Tier 5 weapons or ship bridges and you immediately have so much cash that the display has to use exponential notation (e.g. 1,000,000^E10).\n\nVerdict:  Not recommended.  The game is still definitely unfinished.  There is not much polish. While there are a number of great improvements, I still cannot justify this game as a purchase.  It's confusing for new/returning players unless you're a quick learner or wanna read all the documentation.  Without developer input, I estimate this game is less than 50% done; though considerably more than the 6% quoted by the dev around the time of my original review 7 months ago.\n\nMy point still stands.  Do not buy the game unless you want to support the developer or really like the idea this game stands for.  It is playable now, so if you just really wanna get into space and do things, then go for it. I recommend waiting until a sale, however.  It is not worth $19.99 to me.  If it had a price-tag of about $10, it may be a good price if you're willing to put up with the downsides of a relatively mid-level-alpha.\n\nORIGINAL 1/15/2014\nI don't recommend this game.  Yet.  If the features they have planned for this game come to pass, then this game will definitely be worth its price.   For now, I'd only recommend getting this on a Steam sale. This is a VERY early access with only a few of the main features added.  The building and customization functionality does have a lot going for it and has a lot of potential.  The rest of the game is still somewhat confusing, clunky, and still very clearly unfinished.\n\nMy advice?  Wait a while.  Or buy this game simply to support development of the game.  Buying it to play it may end you up with some serious disappointment.  Don't get me wrong though, as I said, this game has potential.  As the developer stated in another negative review, this game is only approximately 6% finished.  Do not expect much from it.","January 15, 2014","false","7.6"," 293 of 395 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","293","395","0","16"

Such things that aren't in the game yet include any form of story, a commerce system, weapons other than kinetic as well as differentations between weapons other than graphical models.\n\nHowever the development team behind Kinetic Void are working on the game at a decent pace and patches appear within a time span of 1-3 weeks between each other. It wouldn't be surprising to see the game toting more features a few months down the line.\n\nIn the game's current state, it's great for anyone who wants to recreate ships such as Serenity from Firefly, The titular Battlestar Galactica or an X-Wing from Star Wars. And indeed, that is in it's own right an entertaining thing.\n\nAs a result, I find that Kinetic Void is an entertaining video game that, even in it's unfinished and somewhat unstable format that it's currently in, is worth the admission price.\n\nIf this review, nor any other review convinces you to obtain this game, or you're still unsure, there are plenty of videos of Kinetic Void on YouTube.","November 27, 2013","true","5.9"," 108 of 138 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","108","138","0","2"

(After you fix them - don't forget the fact that a number of Workshop ships are technically incomplete, with not all of the subsystems set, and often with far too many subsystems than the other parts can handle. Too many hangar bays is a common example.) The learning curve for the shipbuilder is kind of steep, but like I said, quite functional.\n\nOutside of the shipbuilder, it's cool that you can set up a randomly-generated sandbox galaxy to mess around in according to some parameters that you set during generation - namely, galaxy size and number of factions. It gives a lot of play area, though there's no guaruntee your ship (even the workshop ones) will have the warp range to reach other parts of the galaxy. There are missions, pirates who nobody cares if you go hunting, and faction-relations mechanics - all of which are good.\n\nThe thing is, outside of that it just feels bare. In 8 hours of play I've only encountered "go hear and kill what you find" missions. I haven't delved into the economy or career mode, true, but no "sandbox" should ever feel like there's nothing to do - and that's exactly how this game makes me feel. Sure, I can warp across the galaxy into pirate-held sectors and go to town with a downloaded Star Destroyer or HMS Warspite, sure I can rescue traders from pirate fighters and kill a smuggler or six, and sure it can be enjoyable all the same - I was giddy when I launched in my downloaded Super Star Destroyer and found it to be larger than the space station it was docked at, but all in all I can't really recommend this game.\n\nI bought it summer of last year, expecting it to improve in time, but it really doesn't seem to have gone anywhere. Whether or not the devs are still working on it behind the scenes I'm not really sure. I am sure though that this game has huge potential, but as it is now fails to live up to it. Right now all it's really good for is destroying everything you see. While enjoyable by itself, it gets old when you run into an enemy or 6 using the same ship as you, and that ship is some form of battleship which had until then slaughtered helpless foes. Especially when those enemies are pirates.\n\nI have limited hard drive space, and I am afraid that I'm going to have to uninstall to make room for other, more fleshed-out games. I might still come back to it eventually, see how it's changed (if at all). I just hope the potential here doesn't remain wasted.","May 15, 2015","false","8.1"," 50 of 52 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","50","52","0","0"

I absolutely adore the intent of the game - its execution is horribly wrong however.\n\nThe gameplay has struggled through the Early Acess with odd glitches here and there, and the end result isn't much removed from what it was before release.\n\nThe game concept is a rather free-flowing gameplay mechanic to build your own starship, but the game's design is somewhat flawed on both balancing acts of manuverability vs firepower and basic instructions. This takes a whole other level just to explain how to play the game, and to be honest that isn't right for something like this. The basics of the game weapons are Lasers, Cannons and Missiles. Point-defense systems, cargo, salvage and mining are options for a "career" play to build up resources however the grind is long and boring. Ship movement is your typical thrusters and a hyperspace system to jump from point A to B faster, however when jumping you loose your perception on distance and its an annoying wait to see when the ship feels like ending the trip near the target. The shield is a more literal "kinetic field Generator" to protect the ship from damage, but limits movement. You go faster with it off, but take damge to the hull without a shield to cover your rear.\n\nTo complicate matters the ship construction designs are done impressively free, able to freely rotate and adjust segments any combination you desire without distance restrictions or locking points - but it comes back to bite the design mechanic in how over-use of too many blocks can kill the gameplay performance. Some moderate limitations have been done to limit weapons and design, but it falls back to an inherit issue with the firepower and accuracy. There is no need for thinking small here, bigger ships, more power, shields and weapons will always do better. It makes any ammount of small craft obsolete and limits the gameplay feel - and punishes you for it as the ship becomes more sluggish with its size increasing. It makes the gameplay drag on in a rather negative way.\n\nI admit its a fun way to loose hours in it, crafting a unique ship - but you'll be so drained when done and after flying it for only short distances you'll not want to actually play with it much after.\n\nThe game itself remains largely shallow in its build. No real story, gameplay or function - just create a random set of stars and factions/corporations and choose who you blow up basically. The faction loyalties shift freely with each fight, but it lacks heavily in the substance department for the actual game. No kind of character exists outside nameless portraits and your own nickname. In the basic Career mode you start with a small ship and grind up, but can just kick off in Sandbox to build whatever then just fly faster without the tedious grinding spree to build up to the big ship.\n\nIt is a great concept, plenty of heart in it to be honest - but its end application feels lacking, and in a really big way. Pick it up if your really interested in its unique way of doing things, but be wary there isn't much here.","April 7, 2015","false","41.9"," 47 of 49 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","47","49","0","2"

It is really hard to say anything else to be honest. It is also equally hard to find the motivation to spend time writing a proper review for something that certainly is not a proper finished game. It is not a matter of it simply being in an unpolished beta or alpha state, it is the matter of it being, well, not a game yet. There is barely any gameplay to be had, core ui functionality is completely absent, and the gameplay on offer barely qualifies as more than a tech test.\nThis would be fine, if said tech test was something new, something revolutionary, such as the Swarm tech test or if it had dynamic visual damage on the ships. If there was anything beyond the most barebones physics and graphics engine tech that has already been outdone 10 years ago or more, by games such as X2: The Threat (yes, i said X2, not X3).\nThat is how antiquated this game already is, it is released in 2014 with features, gameplay and tech that has been outdone by games released 10 years ago.\n\nThen, on what basis could i possibly recommend this game? On the basis of it being an indie kickstarter project? No, it isnt good enough. If one starts to recommend and promote any indie project just for the sole reason of "supporting the little guy", we only betray ourselves as gamers and customers with basic consumer rights.\nThere is nothing on offer in Kinetic Void that is better, or even equal, to games already on the market, indie or AAA.\nMany of the competitors even have a lower pricepoint, or have been in the bargain bin for years!\n\nThis is not just about making games. Its about basic supply and demand.\nIf other games have existed for 10 years that do everything this game wants to do, better, then there simply is no demand for this game. If there is no demand for this game, what was the point?\nThe development time would have been better spent pursuing something else, because as of right now i cant possibly claim that Kinetic Void has anything of value to bring to the gaming scene what so ever.","November 22, 2014","false","2.2"," 74 of 94 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","74","94","0","0"

To accommodate nearly anything you can think of, within reason, there are limitations. The shipyard tutorial is annoying and persists every time you go into a new game, divided into chunks of whatever aspect you are using the shipyard. Instead of leading you step by step to build a ship, which would have been better as it is easy to miss some things. Leaving you to fumble around on your own, which has its uses of course. I personally feel that is the better way to learn is through trial and error, but can see when this would be annoying. On the whole however the shipyard is pretty good and the only real issue is the tutorial. Once you leave the shipyard however is the real issue, missions are bland and boring. Collect this, kill that, I was hoping for planetary sieges or space convoys. The faction system is pointless at this stage, I saw a rival faction that owned more systems give money to the only other faction that was clearly there rival as they were engaged in a open conflict. Clearly some issues need resolution here.\n\nGameplay: 2 of 5.\n\nGraphics: Not terrible when the frame rate doesn’t stutter I’ll admit my system can’t run on ultra its true. But when it moves a high-medium for a while then slows to a crawl when more the five objects appear at once, not counting asteroids, ships and stations. Then Huston when have a problem. While textures look decent on some objects such as the lens flare from suns and ships. On planets they look half baked, while passable they could be better. And I’ve yet to find a nebula, so if they are even in here or not I don’t know but I’d hope they look better. In total the ships, asteroids and stations look good, fix the rest.\n\nGraphics: 2.5 of 5\n\nSound: The music is catchy and epic but there’s only about three tracks so you’ll quickly grow board of them. Thrusters and gun fire is about the same sounds good on some weapons but again there’s only about a handful of sounds some that don’t match. Warp drive is nice though, loud boom followed by an annoying repetitive whir sound, that I swear sounds like one of mass effects loading screens.  On the whole they need to fix the ones they have and to add more sounds.\n\nSound: 2 of 5\n\nStory: There isn’t one, I don’t know why I’m here, what I’m doing here or much of what’s going on…\nI suppose this might be on purpose, I e Mine craft in space or other such build your own story. But I’d like some content please.\n\nStory: 1 of 5\n\nReplay ability: Ok so this is the only real thing holding Kinetic voids head above water. IF, and I strongly stress if, you can look pass the whole issues in the game sound, story gameplay. Then you can kill a lot of time here building ships and sailing amongst the stars, tweaking ships, etc.\nReplay ability: 4 of 5\n","December 16, 2014","false","20.2"," 50 of 58 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","50","58","0","0"

Alas at the time I bought KV actually flying the ship was not that good, But!!........\n\n(EDIT 5th August 2014 : Dev Build 14 ship control is quite good, totally enjoying flying  my crazy designs)\n\nThings have changed for the better as patches came along. Now its fun to get your creation made and out into the galaxy, Combat has come a long way since release, and I myself find it fun whilst I fly my ship and bombard the unsuspecting with my weapons. Oh and Combat drones actually do their job, nothing like seeing a wing of my drones attacking the enemies along with my ships weapon systems.\n\nBuilding your ship, at times looks tedious. But its actually quite fun and simple once you understand its mechanics. There is a snap to grid type of mode and freehand mode for fine tuning a module of your ship for that certain look. I can literally spend all my time building a ship save it and begin another as I find it a ton of fun - It is my personal starship lego in my pc - Just a big kid at heart I think.\n\nMining has also came quite a long way, drone now mine the asteroids etc, harvesting ores for selling (A lot more to come I am sure on mining, buts its off to a good start)\n\nUpdates/patches come fast (I have noticed most Mondays there is an update) which shows the team dedication to KV. Some of the latest updates included some nice new backgrounds for the galaxies (Which I found to be excellent)\n\nDev support is quite good, I think this is one place where any game company (AAA or Indie) can excel or die from. Thankfully KV's team is quite good at letting the game players upto date on things coming and patch information. I myself have posted a comment or two and have had the Dev Team reply auite quickly on the topics  (This is something I look for in an Indie Team/Alpha release games - A+ guys/gals)\n\nKV is still very alpha and most of us by now know what "alpha" means and if your unsure maybe wait a little longer, but I have not been disappointed with my purchase. KV has a long way to go with what is planned, but I think its going to be a fun ride as KV progresses into a full release.\n\nI own pretty much every space game from Elite on C64 to the latest flop by a AAA developer, and all I can say is:\n\nKV is another space game that I am happy to of added to my list of games I play each time I log into Steam.\n\nIf space games are your genre, I recommend adding this Indie title to you collection, for the price you will get your moneys worth out of it indeed!!!!","February 13, 2014","true","23.7"," 49 of 63 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","49","63","0","4"

I have followed this game since its alpha, and it's been nothing but a bumpy ride. The devs initially promised a galaxy teeming with things to do, but it was rushed into release and now feels as empty as your relative-who-refuses-to-throw-anything-away's trashcan. The ship builder is great, until you realize that you lack the creative freedom that you yearn for. That's not to say there arent many parts, because there are a TON of parts, which could be a good or bad thing depending on how you personally feel. The combat, although recently updated, feels just lazy and not as inspired as the original concept, and the trade and relations systems are just boring to slog through and dont have much reward in the end. I spent most of my time as a pirate, as it gave me more things to do with enemies constantly on my tail, and that's another thing; the enemies are unrelenting. They refuse to give up, even if they are on the brink of death and you havent taken a scratch. In the end, Kinetic Void is not worth your time at all.

Otherwise, it's nothing special.\n\nThere appear to be quite a veriety of things to do, and events that unfold througout the.. 'galaxy,' like wars, and what appears to be something similar to a stock market of sorts. Otherwise, that's it.\n\nI tried to see what this war thing was all about, only to find nothing different (in the few hours that I had spared after slowly traveling to it), heck even the spawnrate for hostile ships seemed the same.\n\nYou can mine asteroids, salvage destroyed enemy ships, and fight enemy ships, follwed up by crashing into very badly textured planets, which you can't really do anything at, as of yet (I would think it might work as some sort of psuedo space station-asteroid that you could both mine and trade at, or whatever).\n\nThe developers developed the system to be overly complex, only to supply extremely minimal explenations. Experimenting is almost a must, just to get a complete handle of how to do stuff. At some points, I even found myself pressing every single key on my keyboard, just to see which button did what, as there were no other ways to finding out, until maybe recently.\n\nThe space flight itself is incredibly boring, and you may as well be running around in your room, holding a car in your hand, squeeling "Vroom!" like a child- although only moving your ship at a snails pace. In otherwords, the ships handle with an unnecessarily complex system (which about half is redundant/useless), and fly like toys.\n\nThe combat is not much better, depending on how you do it.\n\nMost of the time, you will be just sitting there, either blasting your lasers/rockets/whatever at the enemy, whittling down their shields, and then their hull. Then they go boom. Then you move on.\n\nSometimes, the ships even crash into your own,\n\nThe best way to earn money is to just grind the asteroids away, and sell the ores you get at the stations. (which are now incredibly freaking hard to find, since they made only one every 2 lightyears spawn compared to the usual 10 or so in small groups you used to be able to find).\n\nThe only problem with selling is that you need to first take your ship's inventory, move everything into the station's inventory, and then go to the shop, click on your inventory, then click on the checkbox for your cargo, then the ore/water you collected, then finally.. sell them for ameasily price of what might as well be 2 cents.\n\nThis might be easier if it were in a better GUI, and the redundant stuff being removed. (EG shops being able to buy your stuff directly from ship inventory).\n\nThe exploration aspect is ok, but bassically once you'd seen a single system, you'd seen them all.\n\nthe different faction ships are not really much different from the other faction's, even though the factions are random gen, which I understand- making randomly generated ships as well would probably be a bit too much for these devs.\n\nRegardless, there's no point in exploring, beyond trade (which combined with the slow-paced travel system = you tearing hair out).\n\nRating?\n\n4/10, only because it still shows promise, despite how it looks so far.\nSo far; not worth the money, would get if it were on sale though.","October 28, 2014","false","14.8"," 54 of 77 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","54","77","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uruba/recommended/227160/","uruba","Ace_McIntosh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uruba/","924 products in account","This is the very first Steam product that made me write a review. And a very negative one. The reason is that, apparently, if you don't write a review for Kinetic Void on Steam, your opinion about this game doesn't count. The developer Sean Pollman a.k.a. LumberingTroll (now that I think about the names connected to KV – LumberingTROLL, Kinetic VOID, BADland Studio – in the retrospect, I think those should have been blatant warning signs in themselves, maybe the stupider of us just didn't get the message :-D) said that "KV has sold 120,000 copies and only 351 people gave it a thumbs down [which is the number of negative Steam reviews to the date of posting his statement]". Yes, unbelievable as it may seem, this is actually the mindset of the developer. But that's only the very start.\n\nKinetic Void is a "game" (I am very reluctant to call KV in its current state a game, but I'll get to that in time) that had spent three years in development. Unfortunately, the state in which the "game" happens to be now doesn't reflect it a least bit. From very basic, spartan, ugly and sometimes non-functional UI, to a very poor amount of content in the game (there's really just nothing to do beyond the ship builder). The optimization also is a joke, graphics are so last-century, yet you need a decent rig to run it fluently (X3: Albion Prelude, despite being older game, looks much better and runs far smoother, especially on my former GPU NVidia 9600 GT, on which X3:AP ran smooth as silk, whereas KV lagged like hell all the time; but to be fair, I have to admit that on Radeon HD 7850 I have no problem with either game, so it's especially older computers that will have a problem with running KV).\n\nThe "game" is simply far from being finished. Everywhere you look, every aspect of the "game" that you examine, everything just feels unpolished or downright unfinished. Also, the only part of the "game" which you can actually enjoy is the ship builder which is the most finished feature of the game (by the standards of KV, because it's still lacking in many ways). The rest is just flying in empty space (you can also enter the atmosphere of any planet, only to be presented with a close-up sight of bland atrocious-resolution textures), shooting at enemy ships and mining (consisting of concentrating your mining beam on an asteroid for dulling amount of time). And that's about it.\nAlready dissuaded from buying Kinetic Void? Just wait please, we still haven't even left the starting line...\n\nThree years of development after which Kinetic Void left Early Access program and was labeled a "finished" product (despite still being in the same unfinished state as it'd been always before). That was in November 2014. Now it's almost April 2015 and no progress whatsoever has been made to make the "game" actually working or to expand its direly lacking features. Only a few patches with no actual improvements, save for some bugfixes, came out since that time. Just take a look at the patch announcement history.\n"But wait, the developers just have a lot on their plate right now and maybe they get to it later and right the respective wrongs," you may say. Now, bear in mind that Sean Pollman said himself on the forums that his team has dissolved, and that they're now down to only two people "working" on the "game" (you have to take this in with a very open mind, since that "work" is nowhere to be seen on the "game") and that they've also opened a brick & mortar board-game store, plus they've started working on "another small project" to cover their costs.\nYes, two people are working on Kinetic Void, manning their store and then even working on another "small project", all at the same time. Go figure how long will it take to shape Kinetic Void into anything resembling a "working state" (also bear in mind that to get in its current sorry and unfinished state, it took three years for KV, and that's with more people working on it full-time). I'd wager that it'll take forever and then some, but I'm open to bets.\n\nBased on all the mentioned, it's no wonder that negative reviews started rolling in after the "game" was made "final" in November last year. I had bought Kinetic Void literally week earlier and expected it to stay in the Early Access for some time, since I knew that I was buying an unfinished product at the time (with a very naive hope that I would get an actual finished game someday – I thereby openly admit, that I was very stupid to buy it :-)). When the "release" came week later, I was quite (negatively) surprised by that but I decided to wait a few months to see how the things would unveil.\nWe already know how it all actually went, so it's no wonder that I started getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, along with many other former fans of the "game". So, after a developer posted his excuses on the forum, I endeavoured to reply (very honestly, but hopefully not rudely – I'll let you be the judges[imgur.com]). But boy, have I dared too much by that! Some other people came with their opinions after me, the developer came with his disrespectful retort (check out the review by Mandrake, he's among the ones who had been discussing in this thread) and not a very long time after, the whole thread suddenly disappeared. I don't know if it was deleted by Pollman or Valve (some folks wrote that they reported the thread on the grounds of the developer's disrespectful reactions), but it was. So yeah, I hope you get the picture of how you're treated when you express your dissatisfaction with Kinetic Void or the manners of its developer.\n\nTo sum it all up: if you want to support one individual by the name Sean Pollman who in three years isn't capable enough to develop even so much as a basic game that just works (despite his promises), doesn't respect his paying customers, takes their money to open his board-game store and then calls them (unpleasant) names for expressing their opinions, then by all means, go ahead and buy this "game".\n\nIf you actually value your hard-earned money, then I recommend to stay away from this inept developer and his atrocious product as far as you only can. Get yourself X3: Terran Conflict + Albion Prelude instead, which comes for the exact same price, yet it is a far, far, FAR better product in EVERY regard.","March 29, 2015","false","2.3"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

I enjoy Kinetic Void a lot. I've had this game for over a year now, and in that time I've seen it progress remarkably far, with most of the work going into the Shipyard (by far this game's most impressive feature) and the general usability. The game is in a very playable state, but make sure you read at least some of the tutorials and give it some time to get used to the way the editor works - it's a great tool if you give it time.\n\nThe shipyard, where you build your vessels, is almost at completion (I think they mentioned more parts were to be added), but mechanically it's there and it's very robust. There's a working galactic economy, and factions will vie for control of star systems.\n\nYes, the game's got lots of features to come - some more ambitious ones rely on good sales -  but then what other game allows you to choose almost any given space ship from any game/movie/series that someone has built and fly it around in a sandbox galaxy. You can also change the game files so that, say, one faction uses all Star Destroyers, while another has ships from the Halo universe, Mass Effect or whatever you like.\n\nAnd this is without mentioning the hundreds of stellar, original, designs created by players and uploaded to the workshop (early workshop integration was an excellent decision by the devs). Most 'Space' games will give you the choice of a handful of ships to pilot and own, whereas KV's 'build your own' approach means that aside from as many as YOU can build, you can tap into the creative output of hundreds of other players, many of whom have written backstory/lore for their ships in their workshop descriptions.

You get responses to any feedback or bug reports you leave very quickly and the direction in which the game is headed is very clearly layed out.\n\nI spend about 90% of my time on this game in the shipyard, so I should make it clear that unless you plan to immerse yourself in the ship creation aspect, you probably won't get the most out of Kinetic Void, but if, like me, you get sucked up into the whole creative process of building a ship from scratch, you can't go wrong.

Sadly, with it reaching its milestone v1.0 just a few days ago, I cannot in good faith recommend this game, for reasons I'll outline below.\n\nFirst and foremost, this game still feels very, very unfinished. Going purely on the surface aesthetics, the visuals (which I remain a fan of) may be reasonable, but the interface remains a chore to interact with and there's something distinctly offputting about the cumbersome text windows used to introduce you to the game's mechanics. Overall, it's adequate. But that's all.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Kinetic Void has changed in a few subtle but relatively significant steps since the early access builds of a month or two ago. The economy system seems to be in full drive, and the updates you receive regarding loss of cargo et cetera definitely maintain the connection between you and the big wide galaxy. In terms of the ship-to-ship combat, however, I find that even in its supposedly finished state the controls are unintuitive, with a host of keyboard bindings to memorise which, while I could get to grips with, might not be everyone's cup of tea. There's also nothing particularly inspiring about the combat- you lock on to a ship, then let your guns auto-fire on them until either you or they explode. You can try and manually fire your guns with the handy target-leading reticule now implemented, but it's still painfully monotonous and generally a wasted effort. That, and with the drastic reduction in flight speed that was implemented a while back, the game still plays very slowly and dogfights, which used to be relatively intense, are now relatively lacklustre.\n\nRegarding other aspects of the game: the music remains the same as it's been since I first bought it, and is for the most part adequate. It's occasionally repetetive, and the game possesses no facility for contextual change, so combat will sound basically identical to drifting aimlessly through space. Of storyline there is essentially no sign, but then this was never supposed to be a story-driven game, so there's no discredit meant by that. What could have been a well thought out and richly populated universe, however, has been sacrificed for the sake of customisation.\n\nThis is indeed my problem with this game. Yes, you read that right. My main problem with Kinetic Void is the degree of customisation. Normally, I love games that include vast and excessively complex levels of customisation. What Kinetic Void offers, however, is a deceptively shallow amount of purely aesthetic customisation. Sure, you can build whatever shape ship you want and put whatever guns you want on it. But essentially, what do all those guns do? They're essentially reskins of the same gun, with different 'on-paper' stats. There's no distinct feel to it. As a game intended to be played more than once, Kinetic Void has little to involve the player and prompt different playthroughs. That lack of distinction is where I feel the game really falls down, and it's a problem I've seen with several games offering the same degree of customisation as Kinetic Void. The developers have clearly made a conscious effort to give the player a unique experience with plenty of options, and I respect that. But that breadth comes at the expense of depth. The universe of Kinetic Void is as harsh and barren as space itself, populated with empty, identical ships that maintain a visual pretense of being different. It's a very specific issue I have with the game, and I realise that many people might not feel the same way about it, but as someone whose expectations were built up significantly by the early-access hype, I cannot help but feel disappointed with how Kinetic Void has progressed.\n\nOn a positive note, the developers intend to continue adding features, meaning that there may be a little light at the end of the tunnel for us early-access buyers. For the most part, however, I feel that with significant overhaul now a recently dead prospect, Kinetic Void is and will always be simply an 'adequate' iteration of a dream that could have been great.","November 24, 2014","false","30.3"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","0"

There are some bugs with the mirroring tool that desperately need to be worked out – at times the game will not recognise that the mirrored part is positioned in a perfectly valid location, despite registering the original component as being fine to put down. You can pretty much attach whatever you want to whatever you want. Go nuts – it’s not going to stop you. The basic shapes are generally quite blocky, but there’s enough manipulation to go around that you can, with a little innovation, make some interesting ships and they won’t look like a spruced up Minecraft creation.\n\nCombat, despite being a central focus of this game, isn’t particularly mind-blowing. It’s mid-way between EVE and X3. You won’t get straight up X3 style twitch-based dog-fighting, but you won’t be forced to watch your ship auto-pilot in circles which you hit hotkeys 1-9 to fire your missiles. It's a bit clunky but it works and there's some room for skill involved, alongside some tactical considerations to think about.\n\nThere's an economy. Who knows how it works, but it does. And you start to realise how essential non-combatants are in a universe. Games like X3, Vegastrike, etc - you see so many random little shuttles and traders and civilian craft trundling around the universe from station to station. For the most part they aren't actually doing anything, but it's nice to have them there – they add a bit of flesh to the skeleton. In Kinetic void, you don't have that. There are only military grade ships. This is tied into, and probably because of, the way the game determines what class a ship is - procedurally based on various factors. But it also means that everything is flatly centred on combat. Feasibly you could populate the universe with your own cargo tugs and passenger shuttles and so on and so forth: but everything seems to be classed as a combat vessel, and so you don't want to run up against a fleet of unarmed cargo tugs that the AI has pulled out of the background because it thinks they're fighters.\n\nYou can mine in this game and you can trade, but you are the only person mining in the entire universe, and you are the only actual trader in the universe. That makes it feel very lifeless, despite the fact that there are usually a fair number of ships flying around. The economy runs in the background, and events occur and things change it, but none of it happens in front of you. It doesn't appear to be as fleshed out as it should be. As far as I can tell there are two stations in the entire game: the ship station and the mining station. The mining station appears to be for visual effect only. You can't dock at it and it doesn't do anything. So you mine an steroid for about 5 different resources, trade them for credits at the all-in-one station, and upgrade your ship. There really doesn't appear to be an on-the-surface economy and that’s really disappointing because it’s only logical to conclude that you can’t actually affect the economy through the economy. If you can, you are the only one capable of doing it, when you should be just one more ship in the universe. Where are the other mining vessels drilling into asteroids? Where are the other scavengers going after scrapped vessels? Where are the merchants trying to make a profit from the uncertain wartime market? What are these resources going towards? Why do they exist? What do they build? Who knows.\n\nThe universe needs more persistence. Enemies will show up in your sector, usually accompanied by mission markers, and you can run or fight. They'd be more of a threat if they could affect things if they could harass trade lanes, kill merchants, and affect the economy underlying the various wars that sprout up. Or if they just stayed in system after you've docked. Because they instantly de-spawn the minute you dock so the system gets reset to 0, which means that anything that looked like it could be interesting, could potentially produce emergent scenarios, etc.... well that's gone. This really needs to be fixed, because it undermines everything that a space sim should be about.\n\nYou don’t feel like you’re immersed in the game – just skimming the surface of the under-lying calculations. Wars happen, sectors are taken, but there’s no apparent war. Someone desperately called me to this frontline battle. I expected to be way in over my head, but I thought it would be worth the view, so I jumped into the conflict. Nothing. Concerned that I had got the wrong system, I checked the map. Yep - active war zone designation. I was in a war zone without a shot being fired. The faction holding the zone lost, and were eradicated, but nobody saw them fighting an enemy.\n\nPlanetary flight is fun to have. Not much more to say.\n\nKinetic Void just doesn't feel like it has the depth that you expect from a space sim. It doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be a universe simulation or a combat simulation, and ends up in this strange space between. I honestly wouldn't say it's at 1.0 status. It feels like space sim lite. The ship building is good fun, the fact that your own ships start to populate the universe around you is brilliant. But the universe itself just doesn't feel very alive and that undermines the whole experience.\n\nThe game will run on a potato: with everything turned down to very low it runs on a mid-2010 Macbook pro with 320M chipset at a decent clip and doesn't stutter much.","November 23, 2014","false","6.2"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

However at the moment there isn't enough content in the game to justify the purchase. While there are plenty of parts and they look lovely, adding modules is very tedious, and most of them don't even do anything yet. The combat currently fells quite lacking, fly towards an enemy, lock onto them and push a button to turn on your guns. Now keep your ship so the guns can turn to face them and try to stay in range.\n\nThen there are the performance issues. The performance of the game isn't great, about as good as you could expect from an alpha.

However, it was rather raw then (and understandably so at such an early stage), so I put it aside with hopes it would mature into a great game. I wish I could say that that is what happened, but when I played the 1.0 release of it, my hopes quickly vanished. They've improved the UI somewhat since the game was in alpha, but the game and the UI are still somewhat glitchy and feel clunky.\n\nThe biggest failing that I see in it though lies in what I (personally at least) expect in a sandbox type game. To work a sandbox has to provide an immersive universe in some way such as the building mechanics in space engineers or enough universe lore and detail that the player can feel like a part of everything around him or her. Without this, what would be a glorious sandbox becomes a sloppy game with no objectives. Unfortunately, I see kinetic void as a sloppy game with no objectives right now.\n\nI'm sorry to give such a negative review.

I figure that the easiest way to review the game is to just list off a few of the more notable pros an cons as they are at the time of writing this review.\n\nPROS:\n\n-The game has a fairly robust ship creator/editor that allows you to make some really interesting and complex stuff if you sit down and practice a bit\n-The player has a good amount of control over various aspects of both their ship and their way of spacefaring. Controls are fluid, weapons are responsive, and the game supports both keyboard and mouse control of the player's ship.\n-It was interesting to learn that ship designs you save can potentially be used by NPCs, including enemies.\n-The development team takes their time with updates, but is extremely consistent and dedicated in their work. New content might take a while, but I've never felt that the game has been abandoned by the devs like so many other early access titles.\n\nCONS:\n\n-Being early-access, there are still a number of bugs and other assorted issues to be ironed out. You're accepting that fact by purchasing the game in an incomplete state\n-Space is almost realistically a bit too empty a lot of the time. I'd really like to see the number and variety of structures in each system increased\n-Currently the variety of parts in the game is fairly large, but all parts are locked to one of five size classes, meaning that it can sometimes be difficult to make attractive ships, mainly smaller craft like fighters and interceptors.\n-The game has little in the way of missions or goals. You're dropped in and expected to find your way around the vast expanse of space on your own. This will most likely be fixed later, but hey, that's life, you know?\n\n\nOverall, I'd recommed this game to a friend if I knew that they were interested in a space sim that will eventually be very in-depth and detailed. Right now the game is still very lacking in features, but I have faith in the dev team to complete Kinetic Void, and the amount of content and bug fixes increases with every update.","September 10, 2014","true","25.5"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","1"

I bought this game when it was in Early Access. I also got it on sale for $7. I've held off on reviewing it because I wanted to wait for it to be fully released. Overall, I'm not impressed.\n\nThe ship creator is very fun, but gets boring rather quickly.\nThe title is very apt as the space in this game is certainly a void with almost nothing to do besides the occational space battle or trade.\nI played it for a while, then just got bored. I stopped playing the game entirely until the release of Steam Workshop support. The Workshop added a factor of being able to play other peoples ships. But again, after about five minutes of playing, it just gets boring again.\nThe developers add updates, but they don't really provide game changing mechanics. In fact, aside from the Workshop, the only true update visual on the surface is that the map is rendered in 3D instead of the original 2D.\nThe graphics of the game aren't fantastic, the whole gam just looks, off. The post effects and the engines look nice though. The updates of the game have caused it to lag severely even on the lowest settings.\n\nAs much as I would love to recommend this game, the developers just don't seem to care about how their game as a whole runs. I would probably play this game again if something along the lines of ship interiors and crew were added. So much design has to go into building the interior of your ship, and then you never get to see it.\n\nIn it's current state, under no circumstances would I recommend this game.","December 4, 2014","false","6.7"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","0"

The game offers no direction which isnt a bad thing (space engineers) but the sandbox feel is lost after building your ship.

It has given me over two hundred hours of playtime, which when compared to my playtime on bigger titles, makes me feel that it was still worth my money despite my disappointment that further development did not continue.\n\n---\n\nWarning #1: If building ships and then flying them is not your thing and you're looking for a more linear/on-rails type of game, then this is probably not your thing.\n\nWarning #2: This is not a space dogfighting simulator or a replacement for Star Citizen.\n\nWarning #3: This will let you build a great many types of ships and then fight in them. Don't expect much else. Due to the lack of other games that let you do this as extensively as KV does, I will still recommend this game despite many of the flaws. Edit: I have Starmade and my playtime on it versus this game should tell you what I prefer.\n\nWarning #4: Get player made ships off the Workshop. Seriously. It is not modding per se but more an intended aspect of the game. Pit your designs against that of other players and all in all make the galaxy a much more varied and interesting place. :D\n\n---\n\nDisclaimer: I see a lot of bitterness from people who were following the game for a long time, so I should say that though I was following it, my own purchase was recent and I am free of any negative bias or expectation in that context. I was never a backer. My review should help new people looking for a different sort of space game experience.\n\n---\n\nThe 'Build' here means the ability to build your own ships. As far as I know (so far) you can only build your own ship, not structures or anything else.\n\nThe 'Battle' is you against everything else. I have seen no sign of being able to have NPC allied ships under your control in a 'fleet' (so far).\n\nThe 'Explore' depends on how big you make the starting universe. However, it's only space travel. I don't believe there is any planet landing involved. Edit: However, you can enter the atmosphere of the planet and fly over the surface. Devs plan on bringing in working cities and such on the surface and possible even space to ground/ground to space exchange of fire. :-D\n\n---\n\nEarly hours impressions: having a blast making ships! :D\n\nYet to actually leave the shipyard. WIll update as I play more~!\n\n===\n\nUpdate #1 (12/7/2014): I have left the shipyard and blown up my first space pirates. Hmmm, I think my ship's too strong.\n\nEssential impression: This game is basically the developers providing you with the tools to start your adventure. How you want it to be will depend on you, it seems. For example, I made my ship too strong so wiped out enemies without feeling like I was in any danger. Unfortunately, it's impossible to assess what I can do to have a fun experience at this point. Work need to be done to give some cues to players to be able to intuitively assess how strong they are compared to enemies, etc.\n\nThere appears to be a lot more to this game, and I've barely begun to scratch the surface. Still would recommend at this point.\n\nUpdate #1.5 (12/7/2014; later in the day): found strong enemies. Almost died. Fun fun. Seems the preparation a.k.a. building your ship is 95% of the fight. If I hadn't built my shape they way I had (out of pure dumb luck) I would've died. Me gusta...\n\nAgain, no real way to assess what can happen. You could say this is more realistic. :-P\n\nAlso, The missions just scroll and don't seem to be tracked per se. Not sure I'm a fan of this system. Seemed weak.\n\nSeriously huge annoyance when you are trying to crawl within range of the station to dock in a big ship... Maybe I'm missing something? The 'Warp to within 10' doesn't always work... I often end up 50+ away when warping to a station.\n\nUpdate 2.0 (2/10/2015): still playing this game. Like I have said before, this game gives you the tools to make your own pew pew experience. Highly recommend getting fellow-player made ships and populating the galaxies you generate. Just subscribing will do. Meeting and then fighting said ships will let you pit your design against that of other people. Getting the workshop ships is, imo, essential to enjoying this game, and isn't 'modding' in any way but intended.\n\n---\n\nThere was an annoying ship builder issue that got fixed real fast, so really glad for the support. :-)\n\n[02/21/2015] - more bug fixes and improvements have come in. Some fo my previous annoyances have disappeared.\n\n---\n\nNot entirely stable on my machine for some reason, but this is the kind of game I am willing to play through a buggy experience and support (like the X games minus X Rebirth).","December 3, 2014","true","249.3"," 28 of 45 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","28","45","0","0"

There are hundreds of parts and weapons that basically ensure each ship you make is never exactly the same as the last. There are literally trillions of design options you can make with this. You can make a tiny fighter, or a giant space city, and everything in between. I have literally spent hours exploring many different unique designs in this game, and it was simply a fun experience.\n\nBut what about when you finish making your ship? What do you do then?\nWell, thats where the fun ends.\n\nAfter you make your ship you have the option go out into the vast vacuum of space and explore. Except, theres not much to explore.  All you can do in this game is fight with other ships, or warp to random areas with planets.  The planets have enterable atmospheres, but the surfaces have absolutely nothing. Basically all you do is engage in random combat with any ship you see. You can't trade. You can't make the life that you want to like the devs promised. All you can do is fight.\n\nBut you'd think that when fighting is the only mechanic in the game, it would be extremely good, right?\nYou would think wrong.\n\nThe combat system is outright horrible. You have the option to manually fire your weapons, or have them fire automatically based on groups you assign them.  Its a good system when you look at it on paper, except that all weapons have a range of less than 2 feet. They cannot hit anything at range AT ALL. Not only that, but certain weapons won't fire when you tell them to, if they fire at all, especially in the group system. Even when you're facing the direction those weapons are supposed to be pointing to, they still will not fire.\n\nThere are way too many near game breaking bugs that plague this game. It likes to crash. A lot. Many times have I lost my shipbuilding progress to a crash. There are many graphic related bugs like the planet textures not loading properly, and your ship sometimes appearing completely white.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this game at all. There is little content and way too many bugs. It's not even worthy of being an early access game, let alone a full release.\n\nI tried so hard to love this game, I really did. But in the end it was simply a bucket full of disappointment.","March 30, 2015","false","28.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

This seemed to be the game that would fill the void left in the absence of Elite, Escape Velocity, or a good X game after the abomination that is Rebirth.  Unfortunatley as development trucked along, much more slowly than originally promised at that, features in development began to be cut.  First the scale of the universe was reduced, then the Newtonian physics that were one of the huge selling points of the game were cut in favor of a "simplified" traditional flight model that has ships slow down when engines are cut, turn like atmospheric craft, and have velocity rather than acceleration limits (and these limits are VERY small, measured in triple-diget KPH in the enormity of a solar system).\n\nThe robust mission and faction system never materialized, leaving players with very little more to do than in alpha stages.  Basically you can trade legitimatley, or pirate and sale.  The universe offers almost nothing else to do.  There are no indications of where one can buy and sell items let alone how the prices will fluctuate nor what ship modules will be available until you reach a system in the tiny galaxies generated each new time you start a game.  Even then what faction controls a star system (the number of which can be ajusted when you create a galaxy, but they are nothing more than interchangable names and their influence almost never changes for any reason).\n\nThe one good thing that I can say about this game is that the ship editor is fairly large.  It was reduced in features since the alpha, again in an attempt to simplify which they failed at anyway, but still offers many options in terms of ship design.  The wide range of vessels both original and copies of famous ships from sci-fi series does attest to this.  Unfortunatley there is nothing to do with your ship other than mindlessly shoot other ships.\n\nIf you think that Elite: Dangerous doesn't give you enough help in the universe nor enough interaction with the economy, NPCs, or factions, then stay away from this game.  The tutorials, to the VERY limited extent they exist at all, teach you nothing and somehow saying you recieve no guidence manages to be an understatement.  Even the graphics are nothing to write home about.  Actual old games like X3 or Escape Velocity Nova manage to be better at this, and if you want less story and more trade and exploration with a game that looks beautiful check out Elite: Dangerous or keep your eye out for the (as of time of writing) unreleased Star Citizen or No Man's Sky.","April 4, 2015","false","4.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

After pressing the x button in the corner of the message i'm greeted with the ship editor, except i have no parts, so i cant build any ships, which means the ship builder (-THE- only strong point of this game) does'nt work anymore. Furthermore i could not load my old ships (wanted to see if i could edit them).\n\nIf you plan on pushing the game out of early access to a full release atleast make sure your game works.

So I got Kinetic Void when it was on sale for about $5, thinking why not, then the trouble started.\n\nThe previews for the game show very good graphics with a beautiful star backdrop and detailed rendering of the ships, but with the latest update at over a year old, the skybox does not render meaning there are no stars, planets look like cheese, nebulae fog looks like sprites, etc etc, though the sun has a nice lens flare. Long story short, what you see in the previews is a little misleading.\n\nThe game itself is still in development but had been on hold for a year now, it has virtually no backstory and not alot to do within the game. You can of course try to make the beefiest ship alive and go fight pirates, but that gets old quickly. Eventually you find yourself building giant flyswatters and pitting them against Imperial Star Destroyers if you dare to load up the game again.\n\nPossibly the only thing interesting about this game is it makes fan fiction possible, who would win, the Enterpise or a Starwars Republic Attack Cruiser, the Serenity or a Varkrey, an F-16 or a TIE fighter? Truthfully thats just about what this game has become due to lack of progress.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the game looks interesting, I'm hoping it gets better and finishes strong, but it's looking abandoned and in it's current state isn't worth the $20.","January 27","false","76.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I was told there would be a game, though. I was incredibly shocked when I saw the other day that they are claiming it's out of EA. It's plainly not, they just stopped working on it. Exactly the kind of thing that gives EA games a bad name.\n\nEdit: It appears I was wrong to say that the devs had halted work on the game completely, thanks for the correction. As I looked into it it seems they have still been working on some monthly bug fixes and improvements. Though I don't think that any of the things I've seen listed in the change log really implore me to spend more time on the game even if many of the potential features that the devs have stated they'd like to add were to be added in the future, I'm happy to hear that the devs are still putting in some time.\n\nWhile I'm glad to hear that the devs are still working on it, the statement of calling it a 1.00 version as well as the specific avoidance of promises about what will or will not make it into the game still turn me off enough to wish I had put my money somewhere else, though I admit there's an outside chance I could reinstall on a whim in a year or two and be pleasantly surprised.\n\nSo to sum up, the shipbuilding aspect is very well done and I'd say it's probably a lot less confusing than it might seem at first if you just take a few minutes to adjust yourself. It might still be a little obtuse at times, but you only have to check out the workshop to see how expansive it can be. However, the gameplay to my taste at least, still felt very underpolished and generally uninteresting to the point that I can't have a lot of hope it could ever be anything but outdated at best as of only one patch ago.\n\nIf I've missed anything, please feel free to let me know so I can correct it.","January 10, 2015","false","2.4"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","15","24","0","1"

When I first started trying out the game I instantly hit a roadblock of "what are the controls?". There wasn't much in the way of tutorials and what I did find only helped me to get through the ship building phase. After that I couldn't really do much except for maybe make the ship move forward, at least I think it was going forward. To be honest I just quit playing it because I was hoping that the game would get the needed imnprovements since it was still in early access at that point. I have waited until now and it doesn't really look like much progress has occured and the game is no longer marked as ealy access. While I do get that stuff happens, I feel like this was an over ambitious project that is a bit of a dissapointment with the results. While I can still hope that the devs get it completed and functioning as advertised, I don't see it happening any time soon. I feel that this game might as well be considered dead unless it can get a big revival in the developement.","March 30, 2015","false","0.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

But it isn't, yet.\nIt offers the perfect setting to play a Spacepirat, fight ships, blow them up, scavenge parts and wild them to your ship to gain strength. Sounds great, hasn't been there before. But sadly at the moment thats all there is to this game, the creative sandbox modus is nice for building ships but everythign around is lacking.\n\nErrors in the UI, for exampel the vendor menue the filters a weapons say EMP, Kinetic, Thermal... truth is, Beam, Projektile and Missile.\nPoor scaling of UI, you fight like Ace Combat... uh an red icon, klick, uh an red box around the icon and a red sircle and long bevor you can realy see the enemy it goes boom. You do have an targeing window that shows you a miniature of the enemy ship but i was unabel to detect any impact ov my weapon fire on the ship in the window seams that its yout an automatic generatet icon.\nBeeing a trader is almost imposibel, mining takes for ever and mission reward dosn't scale. Reward for a mission in a fighter gave me 5-10k reward mission in a corvette gave the same.\n\nThe lift of things they have promised.\n\nLet's take small look ^^\nFully detailed and customizable space ships.\nYes best part of the game, surpasses to my eye customisation in Space Empire and Galactic Civ.\n\nHundreds of weapons and modules of multiple sizes.\nThere are many but to get to hundreads you have to use the Borderlands equation. Existing modules times classes, here 5. Very few klass exclusiv moduls.\n\nFully customizable and adaptable controls for mouse, keyboard, and joystick.\nYes its there.\n\nHuge procedurally generated galaxy, limited only by your computers capabilities.\nNo it isn't the max sice is 30 systems and 12 factions.\n\nRandomized factions and political standings.\nFor the most part.\n\nOpen world sandbox, you are in control of your fate.\nSome one has to, the impulses from the world around do not exist. A chat mission every once in a while that tells you about a "mission" errand is no impulse.\n\nDetailed economy simulation with resources, trade routes and more.\nThere are resources and you get chat messages that tell tales of lost shipment and impact on prices, but i never saw any ship docking at a station ore flying towards a gate for traderouts. The more part, thats the module trader at the station. BTW you can enter 50% of all stations... (there are only two kinds)\n\nEpic space combat.\nEpic means you get swarmd at a random mission by 5 exact copys of your own ship and get blastet out of the universe.\n\nToggleable Newtonian Flight\nThats there and dose work for the most part. Max speed is caped at two times your normal max speed.\n\nEmergent gameplay.\nWell Space is big and i taked forever to get somewhere and mining an asteroid is pretty boring in real life as well if you sit in your command chair and watch the pretty light from the laser.\n\n\nSo they realy more or less fullfilled the conditions on the list. To bad it'S not enough.\n\n\nThis is a review you released the game to 1.0 and lost every protection of the EarlyAccses. The Programmers sad we are done its a finished product but it's not. They claim they reached 1.0 but it's not done. But (wow lot of repetition here) If you anounce 1.0 call it a release it has to be done and for every bit it isn't we the comunity are going to scream out in frustration about a nother game broken to the ground.\n\nI will look again at the game in the future, and if it becomes better and gets all the missing parts around a good shipyard i promise i will re-review it.

The 'guide' was bare-bones at best and the interface was clunky and frustrating.\n\nAs an early access game, some growing pains are expected, but this feels a lot less like a playable alpha and more like an unfinished engine with nothing to do in it.

It takes waaaaaay to long to zoom out/in to your ship in the construction menu, and the UI is horrific. Badly organised and ill explained jumble of icons that mean nothing to me. This could be so much better if these things were improved upon. The old UI in the early days of the game was VASTLY superior. It was better organised, more consise and easy to navigate. The older ship-builder was better too, now there is too much fiddling and clicking everywhere. The old one was click and place. not click and click again, and then learning you have placed it wrong so you have to remove it and then click then click again.\n\nIt is such a shame, because this game is a great idea that feels as if it has been rushed. even the main gameplay is dull.

To put it simply, I noticed no improvements that blew me away enough to even notice that this was the finished game, even after forgetting i owned this game and reinstalling it. I particularly don't like the way the ship-building interface is; it looks cheap and ugly. The game as a whole is difficult for me to play, as the controls seem nearly as ambiguous as what I should even be doing. I don't think I'm a terribly picky person, I understand a game does not need to rely heavily on complex themes or dazzling art styles and graphics to be playable, but this seems to be one of those games where it looks so sloppily put together, that it puts me off from wanting to even humor what gameplay is present. To tie a bow on it, I don't believe this game has any real potential anymore, so i don't recommend that anyone purchase it, and I regret buying it.","April 4, 2015","false","1.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Open ended design-build of ships of any size, kind, and configuration.  The graphics were beautiful, you could seek out battles or just cruise through the stars.  At times it was like a living, ethereal journey through space with nice music (and if you shut off the HUD it was like a living screen saver).  It was wonderful.  I took full advantage of the developer's description that “our in game ship builder allows players to construct their ship piece by piece.  Ships can be as simplistic as a cockpit, a single hull, a single engine and a single gun, or as complex as a player wants” and that ships can be “creative (unlimited components)” and I did build these.  Small fighters to huge Dreadnaught size.  But now, with recent mandatory patches, this has all been for nothing.  The advertised “open world sandbox” KV is purported to be is now becoming a concrete, high requirement game just like all the others out there.  All the ships I spent much time building I can no longer launch, and I'm not spending three months rebuilding a single huge ship because of the new “disconnected  components” requirement the developers have instilled (despite their allowing a freeform creation of ships) that came through force-fed updates even when I was opted out of this.  Even upon re-install the changes were there.  This game, in fact, used to be “customizable and enjoyable” but because of the forced changes now it has simply become a chore to play.  This game has gone from my “highly recommend” list to my “highly avoid” list, and the game's description now needs to be changed because it's no longer what it was.  The only questions left is for me to ask steam how to delete it from my games list.","May 11, 2014","false","95.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

This game has great potential however. Unfortunately parts that don't align at clean 90 degrees as you stack them along the x,y and z axis of construction make building quickly, thus realizing an imagined design for ones uber spaceship, a pain in the rumpus.\n\nThe shipbuilder/ shipyard requires that a person has to constantly tweak and align parts manually and even then, small errors compound into funky "curved" and warped hull designs without an obsessive attention to detail. The  shipyard camera also does not have presets  for clean 90 or 45 degree views of the construction. And because of some mathmatical error in the code everything one trys to build is off in subtle ways that compound with distance.\n\nAlso there is a strange limitation on the amount of turrets and weapon systems one can place. As well as an arbirtrary range of sensors and number of targets a ship can engage at one time. Previous iterations of Kinetic Void did not have this.\n\nIt would seem that the devs, under a guise of simplifying subsystems, has severely nerfed a ships capacities and taken customization and choice out of the design mechanics. Without the nuts and bolts differences being outside of the superficial form, the uniqueness is lost. And without that uniqueness and choice the internals of all ships are broadly brushstroked into mediocrity. Allbeit it might make the game "as a whole" run smoother. But it seems the devs of Spore solved this issue and still gave a player massive amounts of choice and customization in a game "as a whole" and within their own genre of science fantasy.\n\nIt looks and like the Devs are taking shortcuts to something they can sell, a Robocraft of space sims. Talk about dumbed down for mass appeal. The end result is clearly reflected in this iteration of Kinetic Void. A "build something junkishly stupid and fly it in space" single player Early Access experience. And if thats your cup of tea, then buy away.\n\n\nNot worth the money!\n\nSince its introduction on Steam, Kinetic Void has gone through many Builds and iterations. Some good, some bad, but all broken in one aspect or another. It would seem that the Dev's of this game are on a rollercoaster of new features whilst not fixing existing content. The Shipyard, at time of this post, is a plague of misaligned components. And with each build becomes prettier, more featured, and more malfunctioning.\n\nI have high hopes for this game, but at this time I can't encourage anyone to buy in.\n\nBut at least this Early Acess game runs. which is more than can be said of many others.\n\nI'll be keeping an eye on this one (and thats mostly because I bought in to it many, many months ago), but as it stands the Shipyard is broken and thats most my the appeal for this game "as is".\n\nDon't buy this, unless you too want to pay for a Dev's learning curve with code. OR you like flying about a digital universe in a junk pile of misaligned parts.

I played quite a bit of it offline and apparently Steam doesn't track hours spent offline.\n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again: One of the most damning words you can use to describe a video game is "potential". With almost all of the absolute worst games of the last generation, "potential" was the best word people could use to describe them. Duke Nukem Forever, The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct, X-Rebirth, these all had massive potential and that is part of why they were considered such disappointments. If "potential" is the best word you have to describe a game, that game has failed, Early Access or no. And sadly, that is the best word I can use to describe Kinetic Void.\n\nI first picked up this game last year in May, actually getting it with a Steam card gifted to me for my birthday. I should've bought something else. This game barely had any content at the time, even for an Early Access game. Earlier this year Earth: Year 2066 was released in Early Access and was massively criticized for having next to no content and that's about what the game was like when I first bought it. You had access to plenty of ship customizations and...that was about it. Then you flew around in a very pretty screenshot area and then you stopped. That was about it. Rarely enemies would appear and then you would attack them in broken combat. Or maybe you went to a ship drydock (which it takes like 4 years to reach, more on that later) and found out that you couldn't dock. I get it, it's Early Access and things are gonna be buggy and broken, but when there's only 3 things to do in your game, you would expect those 3 things to actually work to some degree. So instead it turned into a pretty screenshot game and nothing more.\n\nMoving around in this game in absolutely awful. It takes FOREVER to reach anywhere. I get it, space is big but this is a video game, you are allowed to cut down on size if it makes the game more accessable and fun. Even in FTL mode it still feels like it takes ages to move around, up until you stop paying attention and crash into a planet. Scratch that, you never crash unless you're shot down, so all you do is clip through solid landmasses, whether it's a planet, a moon or a space station, you just clip through it.\n\nThis could have been fixed by either cutting down on the size and scope to something more manageable or to include more things that happen along the way. Encountering Space Pirates (If the combat worked), seeing two fleets battling each other, encountering a stranded merchant ship, these all could have helped it not feel so empty and boring. As is, the exploration feels less like the magic and wonder of something like Skyrim and making me feel more like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXC54bpolHA\n\nI haven't checked up too often on this game since then, I haven't really felt like revisiting this slog of a space explorer but after a years worth of updates I decided to revisit it. It isn't that much better now, sadly. After a year of updates it still feels the same to me, a bit like the difference between the DayZ mod and standalone: Months and months of work and nothing seems to have changed. Things are indeed different, but nothing big is different. Combat is still broken to the point of being unplayable and exploration still takes several millenia to ever do anything at all.\n\nSorry kids, but until further notice, "potential" is the best word I can come up with for this game and "boring as hell" is the worst. Not recommended at all, only spend your money if you want to fund the development cycle. Otherwise, there's too many games for you to buy that desrve your money for you to waste any on this slog of a game.","August 5, 2014","false","3.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Build your ship to be whatever you desire and explore, fight, and be an interstellar accountant(I know that that may not sound fun, but it worked out great for EVE.) inside a beautiful universe which for some reason has awesome music playing in the backround. NPCs will call for your help, maybe ambushing you with three or four enemy ships. The reqirement specs are quite low, I know because I have a 720p 2009 iMac, and the framerate is pretty smooth at max settings. If you listen to the devs, then you can tell that they really care about Kinetic Void. This game has tons of potential, and I think that it's going to deliver.

Skip this game and spend your money elsewhere.\n\nI bought this game as early access in June of 2013. It had great promise as a kind of single player eve clone. Over the years leading up to my review I've grown rather annoyed and disappointed by this game. You see now in April of 2015 the "tutorial" such as it is remains unfinished, in game help is buggy, there are strange ui issues. I've been waiting to see the developer finish at the basics tutorials, help, ui that works, etc.\n\nYou can see other reviews of Kinetic Void with in depth information on what is missing but in the end this game is not finished. Worse yet, the developer asks for input and deletes whole threads where they obtain that requested input and its not the input the developer wanted to hear. Recently the developer admitted that half the team is gone. I am certain the developer will rethink this admission and will delete that comment soon enough.  while not abandoned, the game has little support beyond the developer and two other employees all of which are on a side project.\n\nfine, I don't mind games that are ignored once they are completed but Kinetic void is not completed. Frankly its not even close to completed. Its missing some of the most basic functions and qa rounds any other game gets.\n\nI'm glad I only paid us$7 for Kinetic Void, And guess what? I paid too much. Skip this space game and grab any of the other games out there . Preferably something with a bit more polish.\n\nnote to developer to fix this game you need serious help from a paid qa person or two whom you will listen too and fix all the ui bugs. You will need ot add an in game tutorial, in game reference  and some hand holding. You're going to need to stop removing threads that are critical and instead treat them as honest feedback.","April 27, 2015","false","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The proposed addtions from the devs are potentially exciting, but those changes take a distant back seat to the absolute necessity of fixing what they've already got. The UI is dreadful - this game is clearly informed by EVE (something that excited me), but doesn't have tiny amount of the basic mechanics or interface required to make that brand of flying-around-space experience feasible here. There's "warp to" and "align with", but that's about it.\n\nTo travel from system to system you either need a jump drive (for larger ships) or you need to use a jump gate. Fair enough. But once you're in a system, the gate is simply an object you have to crane around to try and find. It should be on your map. That's just one small example of where this game, for all its promise, feels like something that's perpetually 60% finished.\n\nCombat is rickety and strange trying to include WASD control (?) to orient yourself with options for autofire or a not-very-helpful trageting reticle for manual control. It's not a twitch game, truly (which is my personal preference) but it doesn't have any of the necessary components required to make it an effective non-twitch combat game.\n\nMissions pop up in the general info screen, and they involve the usual suspects (mining, cargo-hauling, fighting, etc.) which is fine. But while you can look under the "mission" tab, there's no log other than the vague mention of some unnamed person wants 6 units of such and such. At present, it's bland and unimmersive.\n\nAnd so is the universe around you. There are other ships (many of which seem to be clones of ships I made for one save and discarded during other saves), but there's little sense of real, living people there. No comm interaction, no options other than to start shooting at them. Which might be useful if the salvaging system didn't seem badly broken with the return on your time+risk+giving up one of your weapons nodes for a salvage beam being, ultimately, not worth it.\n\nAll that said, I respect what this small team of developers has managed to accomplish. What I really get the sense of here is that their reach may have exceeded their grasp. Not due to a lack of dilligence, passion, creativity or talent, but due to a lack of experience. I don't begrudge them money spent on the game, and if I had a million dollars to burn I might even float it their way to see if they could finish what they started with a little more support, both financially and workforce-wise. But with the stated goals on the horizon (even if they are met) not seemingly devoted to absolutely fixing a (currently) broken game, I'm not convinced they have necessarily embraced that the fundamentals need major overhaul long before they institute things like multiplayer.\n\nI really want to give this game a recommendation based on its potential to be the kind of immersive tactical space-flight sandbox it could be, and in the hopes that that would convince the devs to go back to the drawing board and retool the fundamentals. I wish I could recommend it on the basis of the sheer gumption and hard work it takes to even attempt to do what this handful of people has attempted. As it stands, I can't recommend this game as a "finished" product. Not even with new content possibly en route. Adding new facets to a not-finished mechanic are the definition of rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. If the devs fix what people are asking them to fix and make what they've got work well, then I'll happily change my outlook and my review.

Bought the game in early access because I really liked that concept and there was some cool ♥♥♥ looking ships in the workshop. Unfortunately development seemed to slow, and seemingly out of nowhere I saw it on Steam's main store page being that it was fully released version 1.0, After full release I tried playing the game, and could not for the life of me figure out how factions or missions worked at all. It seems that all the actual gameplay elements were rushed out and are not user friendly at all. It sucks, and I know that's the risk of early access. But I don't know how someone could take money from people in support of a product they're making and on the home stretch just throw it out there in such an unspectacular state. I understand that if you run out of money and the game's not selling due to its poor reviews, you've gotta get a day job. At least work towards making it a fun and accessible game in your free time from then on!

The website still sells it as early access. Last update was over a year ago as of this writing. It states:\n\nFor a while now, our biggest problem has been a lack of content once you’ve built your ship, and an in-depth economy    will be a major factor in creating a living world for the player to interact with. This week’s patch includes an early implementation that should give you a basic idea of where we want to go with it.\n\nSo basically with the final release, we have an "early implementation" of a "basic idea" for the economy. I'm certainly not trying to be antagonistic here, but that just seems blatantly wrong to me. It feels pretty deceitful to sell a product as complete when it has clearly not been finished. I really wanted to like it. It was one of the first early-access titles I've purchased and I admit, the ship builder is pretty fun. Flying your ship, or interacting with the universe on any meaningful level seems non-existant. Combat is boring and janky, the economy sim is incomplete, and the whole thing reeks of alpha. For clarification, alpha as in the pre-beta stage, beta meaning the game is feature complete and only requires bug fixing, optimization, and testing. In essence I'm saying that things are missing. Overall, once you finish building your ship, you may as well just quit the game; it's peaked. That was the high point, that was the single most fun thing that you will ever do in this game. It's just boring. Obviously, no developer sets their sights on making a boring game. I'm not mad, I understand money and motivation don't last forever, but this game really should have been *so* much more than what is offered. The procedural random galaxy and shipbuilder alone must have been truly momental tasks to overcome. I don't know what happened with the devs (the forums are malfunctioning or have been removed as of this writing), but it's genuinely as though they just vanished.

Functionality is this game's biggest issue, it throws a lot at you without you having a clue what to do, there are no tutorials and the controls are awkward. If they added xbox controller support it could work though.\n\nAnd yes there are much better games out there such as Starmade and Space Engineers. Kinetic Void is closer to Starmade but is kinda similar to the X series as well. It's great that they intended on melding the two together but it does need a lot of work and a lot more ideas to pull it off. Unlike Space Engineers, you can only design the exterior of your ship so you can't see inside. On the other hand there are enemy AI to fight.\n\nUltimately this game just makes you want to stop playing immediately once you have built your ship. It serves as a good distraction for about 5 minutes (add another 10 for learning how the game works through trial and error). I really do hope that the developers can one day make this game into something brilliant but at this point there is no point in purchasing unless you really want to contribute to the success of this game.\n\nIf you're looking for something similar to the X games but want more focus on customization, this game might interest you.

At least they are honest and told us why the game probably will never achieve the level promised years ago. At least they didn't run off with the money. It's about not having enough resources to go on.\n\nTwo or three years ago I would have said what I was thinking back then : "The future of gaming will be brought through kickstarters and indie inspiration. Big companies don't care anymore". Today, the situation has changed. Bad devs ruined the system and the trust we had at the beginning. A majority of projects never achieve the features promised during the founding phase and run away with everyones money, leaving the game in a bad condition. This has to stop.\n\nBottom line : amazing concept that never made it to release, despite the product being labeled as finished.

Buggy, no tutorial whatsoever, still not well optimized to run, and the ship building, although the interface is better, it still is really complicated a workflow overall. Not even the missions would work correctly. Which was a pain.\n\nOf course, having already purchased this game I decided to cling on and hope for the best, but then suddenly, the game went quiet on all mediums: forum, update schedule, and youtube.\n\nThe entire dev team dropped out of the KV project, pretty much leaving only 2 behind. While it's more of a lack of interest than a 'take money and run' scheme (funds went to dev salaries), the 2 developers that DID stay behind, as much as I'd like to applaud them, can't do much either, not when they are also trying to work on a side project to make ends meet.\n\nI bought the game with high hopes that were never repaid. If you're here looking for a space sandbox, there are other, much better games that haven't been abandoned and left to rot in the pits of Steam. Don't buy this. It was never worth the $20, and never will be.","June 29, 2015","false","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then buy it.\nlooking for something that doesnt require a lot of reading up on tutorials, bug workarounds and shallow gameplay then sorry, just look somewhere else.\n\nWhat money I did spend on this game helped me save huge amounts of cash not spent on other early access games no matter how good the sales pitch is.

I don't think they went into this planning to cheat anyone. Lots of folks dream about making great games, but there are so many things that have to come together to make that happen, and sometimes all it takes is one or two things falling apart. That said, I can't recommend something this unfinished, though it looked like the vision here was pretty grandiose, maybe too much so?\n\nIf it's on sale for less than $5, you might buy it, build some ships, download some modded ships, and play around a bit, but don't go into it expecting Elder Scrolls in space or anything of that nature. I've been in the market for a good space sim and the best I've found is Starpoint Gemini 2, (and even that's not quiiiite what I was hoping for) so if you're reading this, you might go take a look at that instead. Is it a low blow or improper to recommend another game during a review? Maybe?

The few hours I messed around with it showed promise, especially in the ship building aspect. Unfortunately, this is real life -- developers get lazy, lose motivation, perhaps funding gets cut.\n\nThis is exactly why Steam GreenLight was a failure. In retrospect, it's a good idea -- sometimes developers need help or the extra customer funding to push their game to the max. Keen Software is a good example of how to do it; they engage in their community very often, an update is out once every 1-2 weeks reflecting some sort of desire or functionality customers wanted, and it is well-recieved and fleshed out to be a game of its own. Badland Studio had promises, but fell short; a disappointment of a company at best.","July 10, 2015","false","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The only thing good I have to say about this is that the ship creator is bloody brilliant. Real customisation to exactly where you want your weapons, cockpit, engines etc. If it's going cheap it's worth a go just to build a few ships and get really creative.\nOutside the space station though. MEH. There isn't really anything to do. If you're lucky a mission might pop up, and you're even luckier if you're properly equipped to do it. Icons of asteroids litter the screen with no real method of filtering other than 'HUD off'. and the game lacks any real.. anything. So.. Mining the identical poo drop shaped asteroids over and over again for money gets boring very quickly, and for some reason they just explode when you've mined them. This tiny ship can blow up an item that is probably kilometers wide.. with.. mining lasers. NOPE.\nPlanets are empty and don't even have names.. There's no one really to talk to, at all. Would have been nice to hail other ships even if it was just for trading. The little cockpit man that pops up every time you fart or blink gets irritating, just text would have sufficed for the 60th Silicates you mined.\nAfter nearly 3 years of development I'm severely disappointed. Yeah some aspects are good. But it's not playable and it's not a game. What a joke.","July 10, 2015","false","8.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

To be honest, I can't tell you if I enjoy the game or not, since I can't get past just how counter intuitive the ship building interface is. All I want to do is mirror a damn part. You have the tool, you click it, and as for mirroring? lets see, if by some miracle you do manage to get them to mirror.... they will be offset on the z axis, so they just wont align, and can you switch between the parts to do fine adjustment, nope, that button doesn't seem to do a damn thing. Either it's just not meant to do that, or whatever, but that's what I would think it would do... Dear devolopers, have you ever used any 3d modeling software? do you have any idea what 'mirror' means? I have spent the last hour since downloading it, trying to make a mirror image of a hull part. that's all I want to do. As it is, I'm going to just slap a bunch of parts together, throw some engines on it and call it good. I really hope that the actual game play isn't as counter intuitive as the ship building interface. Save your money folks, even on sale it isn't worth what I paid for it. Games are supposed to be fun, relaxing, enjoyable. Not vexing to the point of making any possible enjoyment moot.\n\nUpdate: After another 3 hours of messing with the ship designer, I figured out a few tricks to actually make the parts line up as a mirror image of eachother, but naturally, it is not how you'd think you'd be able to pull it off. Anyways made the ship, launched, got a mission message, and it was very vague.\n\nManaged to mine the required materials, and now I have no idea where to take them...\n\nSuggestion for the developer, go play Freelancer. Compare what you attempted to do with the 'freelance' mode of the game. get a mission, it tells you where to go, add a module, it shows what it does, how it affects everything.\n\nThe KV interface is crap. It's a nice idea, but there's too much of the wrong information, and not enough of the right information. Buttons get hidden, the touch location changes, little bugs, that are obnoxious.\n\nIt's nice that it's an open sandbox, and you get to choose where you get to go and when you go there, but what's the point if the game expects you to guess where you're suppoed to go to?\n\nSave your money, and your frustration.","December 26, 2014","false","32.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

I don't think they went into this planning to cheat anyone. Lots of folks dream about making great games, but there are so many things that have to come together to make that happen, and sometimes all it takes is one or two things falling apart.

Though the sub-systems are a bit tricky to locate. Space is big, open, and empty. Ship to ship combat seems ok, though the trading aspect is a bit confusing. Controls and UI not too terrible, though some further explanation or a tutorial would greatly improve things.\n\nCould use a better mission system. Repeatedly saw messages pop up without any way to know where the mission was, or who the target was. Only missions seem to be combat based. Planet based stations would be a nice addition, though maybe I just didn't find any.\n\nOverall, this is a fun game, but I don't see myself spending a great deal of time on it as it is.","October 5, 2014","true","1.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

You can build ANY design of ship you like or imagine, a small drone up to a huge fregate, how big? your choice, how it looks? your choice, does it have weapons or is a trading ship? your choice! you can even make a station that will not move but will be a trading station.

I originally got the game and spent hours building a ship, definitely going to be a simulation, you have to have housing for crew, where to eat, medic bay, cargo etc. If you build a ship wrong it will float im space with no acceleration or not be able to turn very much. When I first got the game it was an unlimited build, do whatever you want and it was pretty cool to build a monster ship to tear through space. However, last time I tried to play there was an update that gave you a credit limit so small you literally could not build a reasonably operable ship; Leaving out key parts such as the mess hall, medic bay and cargo etc. my updated ship still topped out at about 20 MPH and took literally about a minute and some to turn a 360 (buying only the cheapest parts necessary to fly and still ran out of credits).

I looked at the reviews, they didn't turn out too bad, so I took an immediate interest due to the pictures and effective wording done by the game developers of how it works, and also because of its' high praise by other players. So I bought, and downloaded it.\n\nAfter starting the game, a series of menus (the game played without much lag at all, it seems to be very effectively coded) that brought me to the ship creation menu. The whole thing was obviously still in development, as is the whole game, so I wasn't fazed. So far, it seems to have a solid menu system, and I love and hope that they try to make a little more sense of the icons, numbers, subsystems and such, because it wasn't all clear as to what they did, or meant, or how they affected the ship.\n\nSo, after a few minutes of confused silence, I decided to choose one of the pre-made ships, and set off on my journey through space.\n\nI had fun. The distances were ridiculous, and the slip-space mechanic was a bit underdeveloped, but hey, it's a still-in-progress. What do you expect?\n\nThen I went into the fighting mode, in which I was destroyed in seconds, and had a good laugh at how horrible I was at simulators, and confused as to how exactly the weapons functioned. Once they did fire at the enemies, however, their power was surprisingly underwhelming.\n\nI see a lot of promise in this recently-aquired game, though I've barely tapped into its' evidently deep wells of entertainment. I do reccomend this game as it will continue to develop, and the onward march of progress is a brilliant thing to behold.","March 12, 2014","true","2.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

However once you get into the game itself the fundimental problems with the game shine through again.\n\nKinetic Void tries to reinvent the space sim wheel by making it square.  Controls are overly complicated for flight and space feels empty. Both of these problems have been solved by games made over a decade ago like Freelancer. Mouse flight needs to be implemented better. Warp gates need to be added to define sections of space. Weapons need to feel more powerful and stand out more. Procedural galaxies need to be dropped and replaced with a designed galaxy unless they can make them interesting which they currently are not. I could go on and on about how this game ignores problems that have been solved by older, better games.\n\nMy suggestion... save your money.

Funding is a major problem with small developers, and many either don't plan well the proccess from start to finish ahead of time, things just don't go as expected, or they lose their minds and fall to stressors. Whatever the reason, we'll always end up with abandoned, or so called abandoned games. I've had it happen multiple times. I don't feel angry or regret it in the least. Because without the faith and support, we'd be missing some very nice games. You should wholly expect this when you see 'Early Access' and press that buy button.\n\nThis particular game? If you're nosy about the awesome ship builder, and it goes on sale, sure, might be worth poking. Just don't expect a game.

The updates are way too far apart and the changes in each are minimal.  While I find the concept very intriguing, it ends up being primarily a ship builder in my limited experience thus far.  I have floated into the spaceports, some allowing me to dock but then having nothing to actually do once I've done so and others showing the dock protocol but then not actually functioning.  I've flown around for what seems to be hours on end seeing only the 3 or 4 pirate ships that I believe are meant to be part of the tutorial and then nothingness forever.  Basically, I bought this on the idea, but I refuse to waste my money on these types of executions.","July 16, 2014","false","14.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

Mind you while in early access many things are bound to change.  This game has a ship design system very akin to that used in Galactic Civilizations 2 which should be counted as a good thing.  The amount of customization that is offered to players in the design of their ships is a welcome sight as it’s something I have seen lacking in several games with the same feature.  From building the fastest fighter to the most looming dreadnought the experience of testing out different parts and experimenting with style is a great joy.\n\nPlayers are allowed to name their galaxy and select how many sectors and factions exist within, giving them some level of control of the environment that they start off with.  There is plenty of room for expansion in this area of the game’s development as further options in creating the play environment would add to the overall experience.\n\nThe combat system is decent but could use some work.  While offering a manual mode of firing your ships weapons, there is a means of auto fire via the lock on, and pressing the assigned weapons group number.  In this early build I recommend avoiding the use of the auto fire as my weapons seemed resistant to firing let alone hitting.  However due warning, there does not appear to be any form of aim assist for now, and larger ships will have issues contending with smaller vessels you just cannot seem to hit.  (I am sure that these features will be ironed out in the future)\n\nOther than that there really isn’t that much left to do within the game, yet currently you can see the foundations for what have the potential to be engaging and immersive systems.\n\nI full heartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys building ships from the ground up and actually being able to use them, as well as to anyone who enjoys space simulation games.  For what this game could be twenty dollars is a fair investment into seeing the developers get the chance to finish this game.  Yet to be fair it should be mentioned that in its current state Kinetic Void is arguably worth its asking price, while I love building ships and taking them for a spin there is just not enough to do currently.  With the occasional frame rate issue and bugs, for those on a budget or those who are not willing to drop twenty dollars on an incomplete game I would still recommend getting this game but when it is on sale.  This way you can still support the game, get a great ship builder, and access to what has the potential to be a great game.\n","December 21, 2013","true","23.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

Had a fair amount of fun building some cool-looking ships. An update made all previous work in te game incompatible with the latest version, so I left for a while, unwilling to repeat the entire building process again. It was barely, barely playable at this stage. I could make a ship, warp in, fly around, and that was it.\n\nI cam back after a long absence, and the game has gotten much, much worse. The UI now looks and acts even clunkier than ever, the ship builder has become a visual nightmare of complexity for no resaon, the game itself still has practically nothing to do (if you're lucky, you might pick up a distress call - but good luck trying to do anything about it) ; essentially, it feels and looks totally unfinished in every regard. It's like the Marie Celeste of space sims.\n\nSo I started looking at the Behind The Scenes posts to see what was going on. Woeful mismanagement by the dev, bad use of funding and coding time, and staff departures have led to this game being, essentially, abandoned. this didnt come as a shock, but it was a severe disappointment - I'd been lauding this game previously, leading some freinds to buy it, and had been excited to see new features myself - only to recieve nothing in return.\n\nTL:DR - do not buy this game. Do not support the developer until they can redeem themselves in some way (just being honest doesnt count).

The game was in early access/development and the description of current features and planned features was EXTREMELY different.\n\nCertain features (crew?) will never be added. Really? Also, you used to be able to build your ships as large and powerful (several reactors, drone controllers, etc.) as your rig could support (RAM much?).\n\nNow the game is optomized for business laptops. AND it's apperently in full release. Well in my opinion, it's not in full release until I get the planned/promised features that were advertised to me when I bought this.\n\nAll but a couple of hours were spent on asically a different game called kinetic void. I've barely done anything in this "full release" apart from be extemely disappointed that the only working, fully fleshed out piece of the software (the ship builder) was nerfed for people with inferior systems (with no way to bypass the limitations for a real computer).\n\nIf you want a "nifty" ship builder program for low end laptops, this is it.\n\nThe "missions" and "career mode" or whatever are so absurdly flawed and empty I've never even opened them once - don't believe me? Watch a "let's play" or any youtube vid of the current build. Oh wait, good luck with that :(","February 27, 2015","false","25.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I have to say that the games progress has been extremely dissapointing. It really feels like a mix of the devs losing inspiration and focus on little here and there items on their fix-it lists and no longer try to focus on the big picture or the concepts that made this game sound so appealing in the first place. This game really has the feel of a team that had a very ambitious concept but as many other teams, just could not bring that ambitious concept to life as intended.\n\nFrom the time I have started with this game, all the way to this day here are the following things I have noticed about the game itself... It lacks the feel of a true game with little to no real direction or incentive. Of course in some sandbox style games this can be acceptable, but this game is so devoid of anything of worth that the game world isn't worth being in with your created ship. This is a MAJOR downside and this game is in severe need of more variety and direction. The ship creator however complex, has little to guide you, and even less to really inspire you unless you are good at looking at a blank screen and scrolling through menu's to put your great works of art together. That is basically the ONLY point of this game at this moment.\n\nThey have added random somewhat or completely nonsensical features that just don't fit the game at its current build, such as other ships roaming around, or 'factions', but none of it matters at this time. At this rate this game will most likely remain incomplete unless they find a new ambition or give the game to another team to breathe new life into it. Unless this happens, I do not reccomend you buy this game, even if it is on sale its not worth the money currently.\n\nI will update this review monthly to bi-monthly to let you all know if anything has changed, or things have been added that increases this games worth/value. As always I hope for the best with this and any game. They had great ideas and concepts to work with, but the execution has been extremely poor and uninspired.\n\nFinal Verdict: DO NOT BUY AT FULL PRICE OR ON SALE. Overall: 1/10 Sound: 0/10 Gameplay: 0/10 Concept: 6/10 Ability to create/customize: 5/10.","March 6, 2015","false","1.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

So I took that in consideration and looked in the long run. Not just as to what it offers at the moment.\n\n\nKinetic Void is a new genre of Spaceship Simulator. Having it's roots from the old freelancer and other games from the genre, it bring us new aspects of the game. Creating your own ship.\n\nKinetic void let the players create their own ships, the way they want. You are able to design and create the ships you want for any purpose that may suite you. Want a nice looking sleek ship? Go ahead and make one. Want a big though ship like the Galactica? Go Ahead. And when we talk about creating ship, the Devs have gone further then just looks. All of the ship needs, from the power to radars, to crew quarters are your to choice to decide where they go. And to protect these important systems is one of your goal. Having, technically, no limits, you can build any ship you would have though about.\n\nBut creating ships is not the only aspect. If this is something that is not your taste, you can simply take some of the default ship, or why not download some designs from the community workshop? Having over  thousands of community created ships, there is a ship for everyone out there... If designing is not your taste.\n\nKinetic void launches you in a Procedural Generation world where Factions of NPCs each struggling to survive and conquer the galaxy in their own own. You are sent in this sandbox word with one goal: Living your life how  you want it. You want to be a merchant, selling Goods around the universe? Go ahead. Want to be a smuggler and go past blockades? Want to just shoot at things and be a pirate? Or defend the innocent? All is yours to decide.\n\n\nKinetic Void aims to  be one of the, if not the space sim with the most opened up world, with the most customized game possible and it does it in a way that makes  you wonder: Why no one though of this before?\n\n\nIf you are a fan of any space ship simulator, Kinetic Void is a must. From it's amazing artwork, to the infinity of customization, to the hard work of the Team, there's absolutely no reason not to have this game.","September 25, 2014","true","45.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The game does it for you sometimes. Then when you try to load your previous game it won't let you. The shipyard ship assembly should have a back/undo button so you can undo a mistake. Instead you sometimes end up erasing a module that you've spent time on when you selct something to edit and it erases the module connected to it as well. Then when you have  completed your ship and want to take it for a spin you are let out in the middle of nowhere. So you have to warp to get somewhere in order to interact with anything. As you enter warp the ship that you spent time constructing is shaken apart! But not to worry it is reconstituted as you exit warp though you may have difficulty recognizing the mangled mess that is your ship. This game is not ready for release.

And they make it somewhat unclear what exactly you can do in game right now. But, I'm not going to talk about what's missing; I'm going to talk about whats there. What you can do in this game right now (at the time of review) is design and save a spaceship, configure ship modules, launch ships, "explore" space (which is rather empty for now (although space is rather empty realistically speaking, it should not be for the sake of the game)), and complete glitchy and random quests (or at least try to).\n\nShip building is certainly the phase where people spend the most time on (at least for now). The ship building is like a gimpy artistic outlet where you can create almost anything as you imagine it. It's almost like legos... but not quite. It's actually more like the generic brand of slightly out of shape bootleg lego pieces. You really couldn't build to your heart's content with them because they looked weird compared to the legit lego pieces. That's how I feel about this game right now... Building your own ship is nice, but the problem lies with what you can build with. The parts you can build with are currently preset and are very limited in variety (also I'm pretty sure a few of the pieces showcased in screenshots and trailers are missing in game). Along with that, the interface could be better in my opinion. All this makes it harder to creatively express your imagination.\n\nMoving along, the next thing you would do after you've built a ship is launch it. Currently, I don't think the spawn system is consistent as you seem to spawn in a random place everytime. But that doesn't really matter when you don't really have much to do. You can look out across empty space with stars staring back at you. I'll have to admit, it's quite pretty the first few times you see it. Starlight glare into your eyes and gleams across your ship. However it does get rather dull and boring as you sail aimlessly. And I used the word sail, but it's actually much less majestic than that.\n\nWhile in space, every once in a while, you'd get a notification hailing from an ai entity. These will be the glitchy quests that I have yet to be able to complete (might be just me though). Most of them have to do with killing ai ships. Sometimes someone will tell you to "check something out" but that usually leads to enemy ships. As of now, you can fire your weapons on your ship. But I must say, it is one of the most lackluster and annoying combat systems I have encountered. Hopefully this is just a placeholder.\n\nAll in all, this game in this state is not recommended by me unless you wish to blindly support the developers or if you actually like generic legos. In the future after they've renovated it, I could maybe change my mind as it is a rather interesting concept.","January 31, 2014","false","12.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

I have so much high hopes for this game and i've only managed to find out when it was on sale, i would of gladly payed the full price! (If and when i had the money xD) but this is a game for all Space Adventurers with a craving of customizing your very own ship to as much detail as the game can generate just for you, a Game i very much look forward to being completed by the development team! (as a wannabe Developer myself) I look up to you people, and i know almost everyone else does, so keep up the good work and to you people reading this, Take a chance, Buy this game and Hopefully you wont be disappointed!!!!

Things to come from what I read from the Developers\n\nMissiles\nLasers\nCombat Ai\nand so on.\nThe game already has a wide range of guns and cannons, making for a great mix and match.\nIt has some missions, mostly from what i done, is rescue a allied ship under attack.\n\nI recommend this game, but please know its still early in development, so dont be too harsh on it.","December 31, 2013","true","8.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Truly giving the player the feeling that they're in a massive, open, and dangerous galaxy (which the player can make to an extent). Allowing players to make vesels of any shape and size; players can make speedy cargo ships to extremely large and powerful ships bent on destroying their enemies. Never the less adventure always awaits you in "Kinetic Void", and there is still more to be added to the game in the near future. So when you make your space vesel and enter your galaxy try to "live long and prosper".","February 22, 2014","true","16.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

This game is incredible fun even in its current state and i can only imagine what the future will hold. Currently it feels like a combination of Starmade and Eve. Starmade in how you build and manage your ships and Eve in how combat flows (But without insanely long buld times and skill trees ((yet???)) ). You can buid everything from tiny fighters to dreadnaughts the size of planets and beyond. Build you ship for looks or to focus your firepower tacticaly and as for guns....the new system gives you LOTS of options. The game has had it's bumps in the form of glitches but the creators actually listen to the community and talk with us to try to figure out whats going on so they can fix it. If i can hope for one thing to come it would be the ability to fly with friends.\n\nUpdate: The game now feels alive, so many ships flying about and reports coming in all the time keeping you up to date makes the game quite exciting now. All i can hope now flying about in space is that the developers really consider adding the ability of multiplayer. Flying about with friends or opening up a public server for massive clashes between player groups would be amazing. I can honestly see if this game gets multiplayer it becoming a cheaper and far easier alternative to EVE for people like me who refuse to pay monthly fees.","April 13, 2014","true","71.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I have so much high hopes for this game and i've only managed to find out when it was on sale, i would of gladly payed the full price! (If and when i had the money xD) but this is a game for all Space Adventurers with a craving of customizing your very own ship to as much detail as the game can generate just for you, a Game i very much look forward to being completed by the development team! (as a wannabe Developer myself) I look up to you people, and i know almost everyone else does, so keep up the good work and to you people reading this, Take a chance, Buy this game and Hopefully you wont be disappointed!!!!

I believe that you have to kill enemies to get more money so you can buy more ship parts to make you stronger or get supplies to mine. I'm stuck at the first step. I can't seem to come even close to defeating an enemy ship (usually they come in groups of two or three, so it's essentially impossible). I fire everything that I have, hit the ship so many times, but there health barely drops...and then regenerates. Mine, on the other hand get destroyed very easily.\n\nSo, I gave up on trying to fight for a while and decided to go exploring...that didn't work out either. I spent like five minutes using warp drive (or whatever the Kinetic Void version is), just to get out of that same starting area. I thought this was going to be easy, but apparently not. All that got me was five minutes away from everything. The only thing on my radar was that starting station. I also can't figure out the map.\n\nChances are, I'm missing something really obvious, but I watched their videos on combat and did everything that they did, but I still fail every fight with the enemy. An in-game tutorial is a must-have for games like this.\n\nOnce this game is complete, I would love to see it as a rival for the games in the X series, but it has a looooooooooooooong way to go.","March 29, 2014","false","5.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

That means it goes in one ear and out the other. Thus the "tutorial" system is extensive but is not actually suitable for true beginners. A better way to hook beginners would be to rapidly show them a quick-and-easy barely useful build without going into every detail of that build. Then get the player launched, guide them to another system/whatever and dock. Travelling to the other system should show some of the features/drawbacks of the build. Then enhance the craft. Launch. Script an easy Skirmish and guide them through it. Guide subsequent repairs. Return to dock. Buy replacements, upgrade, etc. That is a true tutorial -- what exists now is more akin to a one-time hovering tooltip.\n\n\nThe graphics look good and the complexity revealed thus far hints at greatness. Unfortunately the time and rote memorization it takes to get initially acquainted with this game keeps me from truly playing it. I've never truly gotten out of the hangar before I had to quit and at that point there is nothing exciting about the game that makes me want to return to it any time soon.

What can I say about this beauty? For starters, the ship building is easy to use an monumentally powerful. While I have encountered some games that give you about 20 pieces and 20 spots to put them, Kinetic Void's ship builder truly lets you build whatever you want. If you don't like using the node system to place pieces, there is a freehand mode that lets you put anything anywhere. There are tons of pieces and all are resizable. On the largest setting, the pieces are insanely massive, and the more creative will find many pieces to build full size replicas of some of sci-fi's most famous ships. But this game isn't just space ship builder simulator. It has an incredibly well made space exploration portion. The ships to show their size quite well, as maneuvering a giant capital ship take much longer than a small agile fighter. There are tons of weapons of different damages and types and there are also preset ships for new players to use. In conclusion, Kinetic Void is an absolute masterpiece and I cannot reccomend it more.","April 16, 2014","true","15.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Most notabely the ability to design your own space ship, designs which NPC's are known to use as well, to keep the playing field balanced.\n\nAdd to that relational status with numerous factions and reasonably large universe (can be set upon creating one) and you have yourself a great arena to test these designs in. Don't have an enemy? Create one by just randomly shooting ships that happen to pass by. You could always go mining or salvaging derelict craft for resources as well.\n\nGreat graphics and awesome soundtrack, easy to learn controls, but sometimes not so clear on what, though optional, you mission objectives are make this a nice addition to any collection.\n\nThere are some problems though, crashes, editor that has trouble doing certain things, but nothing really game breaking. And although I'm not much of a multiplayer gamer, I can see some real potential in that latest addition as well.\n\nBare in mind though that this is still an project in development.","June 23, 2013","true","29.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have watched this game grow (and continue to do so) since July 2013 and am pleased by the progress that the developers have made so far, but there is still much work to be done in order to refine Kinetic Void. I would recommend this game to the following types of gamers:\n\n-Gamers who enjoy being creative in taking parts and building something of their own, but poses the patience to have to tweak, rework, or even recreate what they make after major patches come out. This game is still early access so it is understandable that these things happen and the patches generally make things easier.\n\n-People who enjoy a good RPG type simulation that takes place with ships, factions, and fleets, and can spend hours upon hours of trial and error to find out what works best in this game.\n\n-People who have ever played Battlestar Galactica Online: the game has a similar feeling to it and I feel that people who enjoyed that MMO would feel right at home with Kinetic Void outside of the ship creation menu\n\n-Peoplewho have played and enjoyed Kerbal Space Program: If you enjoyed the building mechanics in Kerbal, expect to enjoy Kinetic Void\n\n-People with a lot of patience in general who can wait for something to blossom to its true potential.\n\nI won’t lie, this game still has a lot of bugs (some are actually quite comical) but the Developers have done a good balance of both fixing these bugs as they come up and adding new content to the game, and I hope they continue to do so.","July 26, 2013","true","123.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even if the gameplay turns out to only be so-so, I'll still consider this money well spent.  The ship construction is incredibly good, both simple (though it takes some trial and error to figure out the eccentricities) and complex enough to satisfy... well... someone who has spent hours building a single ship.\nSomething else that blew me away is the soundtrack!  I was nervous when the first track ended (mere minutes into my shipbuilding exploration!) that it would just repeat.  Nope!  Although tracks did repeat over my multi-hour session, there were enough and I enjoyed every single one so much that I was entertained the entire time.\n\nIn sum, based on a couple of hours of gameplay; a fantastic ship builder and gorgeous soundtrack make me think this may join my list of all-time favorite games.","August 31, 2014","true","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While I love space sims especially with that sandbox aspect I have a few complaints.\n\nI started a career mode game so I could try it out. I hadn't played the game in a few months and wanted to see what was new... Not much was for starters, but that is to be expected, a lot of Early Access games don't have a lot of updates (Except for something like Space Engineers ). I picked the random parts and started building my ship. After 1 and a half hours of fumbling around both because of player error, and because its a little weird... I press launch only to have to put in subsystems. (no I couldn't read the tutorial, the UI freaked out and overlapped the words) Once I figure (sortof) that out, I launch it... The game loads, and within 5 seconds.. not anymore or any less, I was destroyed... So I tried again... and again... Only to end with the same result. Then I go to the main menu, and decide to try and load a 65 part ship from my workshop... It loaded, and a warning popped up saying that I had to many parts and it might crash... 65 parts, and I hadn't even added the big shiny hanger doors and millions of hanger control modules I wanted to.. So I decided to launch it (and after some more subsystem fumbling) got it launched. I fought off the army outside, and then got up to my max speed of 57. In space. In a simulation game. Then I look at the directory, and find out if I press T and turn off a shield thing that stops me I will go faster... So a top speed of 83. Way to go for the USS Gweepo... A new speed Record. Then I point it towards the nearest planet hoping I will be able to use the new mining laser thing I put on to mine stuff off the planet. I watch as the numbers slowly decrease from 202.1 to 202 to 201.9 and so on. After seeing that I did the only sensible thing. Tried to warp towards the planet... Only to warp into it. Ten minutes later I spawn again and warp (correctly luckily) to the planet and try and land on it. Only to die again.\n\nOverall, I think this game CAN have potential if the devs iron out the bugs that it has. They (he\she\it, I dunno) seem to be very interested in te steam community so I give them points just for that.. Also, collision, and speed especially when it says that if you press the "T" key it activates Newtonian flight, should mean I have a fixed acceleration, up to an infinite speed. Not just a faster speed. Big ships need a boost, the AI needs help, Weapons need balancing, People need a little breathing room at spawn. Along with that comes the good stuff about it. You can (at the risk of crashing) build masive ships that destroy entire fleets (it was fun, until the game engine died) You can also build little fighters that reach 800 (units of speed and distance needed) While it may not be the #1 space sim on my wish list (Limit Theory is so awesome :3 ) It has a fighting chance.

I've spent most of the time just building different ships in the game. The amount of detail allowed in customizing the ship can be staggering. You place hull parts and engines, fill those with subsystems that affect the ship in different ways.\n\nCurrently you can take it out and fly around, shoot other ships or mine. There are also factions in game that you can do missions for that are generated for you as you are out in space. Newtonian physics as an option adds a great layer to the flight. Nothing better than strafing around at high speeds while in a dog fight.

This is early access and I was expecting an unfinished game, which it is... but the amount of potential this game has is crazy. That and the fact the developers pay attention to the people suggesting things on their message boards, really makes me happy I bought this now, because every update just makes this game better and i keep waiting for the new one to play it and see all the new things they put into the game. It does have bugs, but surprisingly nothing game breaking for this early in development. Right now i am writing this during a one day sale and suggest you buy it now, you wont regret it, unless this is not your type of game. If you like space games and building games, because the ship building mechanic is really fun by its self, it is probably something you are into.","January 15, 2014","true","20.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The game as it is, is a lot of fun in my opinion. The ship building aspect is very entertaining and allows players to create whatever sort of ship they please, from small one-man fighters to giant hulking cruisers. Once out in space the game can get a little empty. There are missions to do which give you an immediate objective or you can go out and sort of do your own thing. There is mining for resources and diplomacy which allows you to go into a hostile system and hunt enemy ships for bounties. It can get a little old though. In my opinion, more diverse missions should be added as well as an option to select mission based on what kind of playstyle you have (maybe a mission interface at space stations?). This would allow players who want to play as a pirate to do raid missions, miners to do resource gathering, etc... I also think smaller stations should be implemented that do not have shipyards, but rather some sort of other funtions (ie. Smugglers' dens, military instalations, trade centers, etc?).  One more thing I would hope to see is more interaction with friendly faction ships, because as of now, friendlies just sort of drift around space and don't do much. I'd like to see something like, escort missions for friendly factions, or the possibility of hiring wingmen to fly around with you and assist in combat.\n\nI think the game is deifitely on the right track, it IS a fun game as is but it still needs some work, I hope a DEV gets the chance to read this review and think about the suggestions I've made. I think implementing  some of them would make the game feel fuller once the fun of ship building wears out or you've run out of ship ideas.","December 4, 2014","true","475.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","0"

A few annoying bugs and glitches which hopefully get fixed sooner rather than later. The ship building is amazing. despite the bug and glitches. It is fantastic. Easily the best part of the game with me. Space flight is not too bad. I think as and when future updates come out then it will improve. Right now you just fly around shooting stuff, mining asteroids, selling the ores and building bigger better ships. Would like to see the planned economy come out. That should improve the gameplay a lot, Would also like to see the ability to start a factions, take space stations, mining stations, claim systems, Have NPC ships fly around the galaxy mining, and defending territory.\n\nPerformance of the game is very good. On High end hardware the game runs over 110 FPS on maxmimum settings.  Graphics are very good in most places. In some places like the engine trails, they are pretty poor, at least to myself.\n\nShould you buy this game? In my opinion yes. While right now there are bugs and glitches, which is to be expected in an early alpha game, The future looks bright, with the developers looking well into the future with possible multiplayer and DLC content.","May 20, 2014","true","57.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

It seemed to me that the community got spoiled from DEV interaction that they expected the world. I haven't played this since it's pre beta phase but what i noticed is this. Not only can you make just about any ship you can imagine but any ship you make will be ingame flown by npc's. So what i did is subscribed to about 300+ player made ships and guess what... some how they are floating around in the game world. You can decide how large/ how many star systems/ factions are in your game at the start, as well as do missions for them. but this seems like if your dream is to not be limited by developer made ships you can fight any number of different space battles.\n\nI just wish they added the ability to buy/sell full ships in the store. That way someone who was playing the regular mode without infinite money and parts could save up enough to buy one of the ships on the steam work shop or even a generic basic ship without having to make every detail.

The generated universes are very featureless and bland.  The combat is a snorefest.  A sad skeleton of a game built backwards from the ceiling down.  There's a neat ship creation system but with nothing compelling for you to do with the ships you create, it's utterly pointless.\n\nThe only entertainment I can find anyone having with the game thus far is creating ships with the generator and then posting them on the workshop.  Consider the game LEGO with spaceship parts, then.\n\nI'm sure this review will get thumbs-downed like nuts from a bunch of apologists who would recommend the game to you on the basis of what it could be and not what it actually is.  Anyone who would recommend this game to their friends based on its current state is a poor friend to have.","June 10, 2014","false","0.5"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

I liked the concept of it enough to buy it (obviously) but when I gave it a try found that it lacked well, a lot. Its not just the fact that this game is in alpha, its that it has an amazingly bad interface and control scheme, bad graphics and sound, and sub-zero immersion factor. Its like this is a ship building tool with a few minor non-ship building features. The ships look and fly like toys. There is no sense of flying a technical marvel of space travel, it just feels like you are taking your cardboard box out for a spin in the driveway. Let me put it this way, if Steam let me try this before buying, I would not have purchased it. My advise to the devs, play a few space games like Freespace, or EVE Online or Privateer or Indepence War or something then take a long hard look at Kinetic Void and make some much needed changes. Frankly I am shocked that anyone can even play this game is its current form. Kudos to you who find something of value in this game but it makes me wonder if any of you have played other space games.","October 14, 2014","false","0.6"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","6","19","0","0"

The initial part, the ship builder, was amazingly designed, only a tad confusing. After I created the ship, however, it spawned me in a galaxy. The flight controls were very confusing, and it would be nice to have a shipbuilding and flight tutorial added somewhere within the game to be easily accessed. Anyway, I pressed a wrong button and my ship exploded. Every time after that, my ship exploded. I have talked to the developer, Kaypix, and he says that all you have to do is create a new galaxy. Please don't get frustrated like I did. If you don't know what to do, Google will be your best friend, as well as amazing developers like Kaypix. I had a negative review, but I have changed my opinion. Buy this advanced game, but be sure you know exactly what you want when you get it, as the controls are confusing.

Currently, it reminds me of much of Digital Anvil/Microsoft Studio's Freelancer - a game I VERY much enjoyed for providing a rich, detailed universe.

Runner, gunner, fighter, freighter...  armed to the teeth or built for speed - or ANYTHING in between.  Build a galaxy to play in.\n\nThere's a lot to see and do within the game, and I think having access to the design creativity of the Steam-going public as well as a talented design team will provide an excellent experience.","September 3, 2014","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yeah. Not anymore. Now it's a dull, repetative, REALLY slow space game where by you need to mine ore, salvage ships and trade in a dull flying sim to make credits and upgrade your ship.

It has not improved since it was launched on Early Access, if anything the updates made the 'game' worse. What's now worse is that the game is abandonware and hasn't been updated once in fourteen months. The game is riddled with bugs and glitches. The only redeeming quality is the music, which was outsourced to Artem (I believe) and can be Googled without buying this trash. AVOID. Wish I could get my money back. Too many developers these days take your money promising the world, then after months of excuses, run off with your money. Steam won't refund anything past 14 days so you're screwed really.
