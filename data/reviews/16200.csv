It's like two different artstyles decided to come together and argued about custody for the game and got joint custody. It's not good.\nThe gameplay itself is rather straight forward. In the beginning there's some puzzle elements which draws you in. I do wish there were more of them though as they are fairly easy to complete. The upgrading to the house can be made within a couple of generations and once that is done, what is left is achievements and collections. Some achievements will take forever and the collections are a game of chance. (after 35 hours of playtime I'm still missing a lot of bugs)\nBut despite the game lacking so many things, and the poor art style I keep going back to keep playing it. The pace is nice, the people don't live on forever but you can start up the next generation after about 3 days. It's a casual game where you end up caring for your family and it's lines in a very short amount of time.\nI would recommend this game to someone who doesn't have a lot of time on their hands every day to play and who likes the more casual sides of things. It left me wanting more, but at the same time, it's good enough.","June 27, 2014","true","43.8"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","0"

Think of it like sims, only that the game continues even when you're asleep. The music is terrific, you can bond with your virtual family really good, and keep them on their toes, to guide them to prosperity. Its simple yet addicting.","July 20, 2012","true","17.5"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","3"

You can play it for 5 minutes, not even, and then shut it off to come back hours later to find them only a few "years" older or you can leave it for a day and it's the same thing really.  I'm on the second generation and I still haven't purchased all upgrades.  O_o","December 31, 2011","true","101.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a pretty dull game once you've gotten everything in it, though. Once you do have all the upgrades, you're left to just do the same thing over and over again per generation. It gets very boring.\n\nReally, the only thing you can do is try and complete all the challenges or see how many generations you can run through. Once you start a new game, it actually feels a lot more boring and aggravating than having to deal with the same situations all day long.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't recommend it unless you like doing the same thing. If you're bored easily, then, yeah, wouldn't recommend.","May 25, 2015","false","37.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
