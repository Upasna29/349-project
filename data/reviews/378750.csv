I decided to go ahead and buy it again on Steam just cuz it looks like it's a slightly better game than the 3DS Original and, to my satisfaction that is completely true. The game runs at a solid 60 Frames and it just feels a bit tighter overall.\n\nOnly drawbacks I've noticed is that Full-Screen makes the game look horribly fuzzy, and the Quick Restart Function doesn't work (unless you've beat the level once, which kinda doesn't make sense to me). Other than that I'm seeing no real problems with this title, and even in its native windowed resolution it's still pretty big without taking up the entire screen (which is pretty comfortable imo). So if you haven't already tried a Umihara Kawase Game yet, want a new UK fix, want to try a slightly better version of the 3DS/Vita Game, or just want said game on PC, then I'd say check this one out. =)","October 6, 2015","true","3.0"," 52 of 59 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","52","59","3","3"

Playing this game was quite fun but very challenging and often found myself swearing frequently in my head.\n\nThe platforming is very unique in that you use a fishing rod as a hook and can pull yourself up walls and dangle down. It almost feels like Splinter Cell Kawase. I do have a video of my first 15 minutes or so, feel free to check it out.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWQagPYD6pY\n\nWould I recommend this to anyone?\n\nI feel the unique system of rapelling yourself using the fishing rod is awesome and quite challenging as well as the funny enemies (fish) located around the map are quite amusing and made me laugh. The steep difficulty curve is very interesting too.\n\nI would avoid this game however if you're looking for a fresher (newer) looking platformer as obviously this one is quite dated or feels like (mostly because of the 70s japanese vibe to it). I would also avoid if you're wanting an easy casual platformer or looking for some adrenaline blood rushing action.\n\nThanks, feel free to let me know if I need to add more to this.","November 9, 2015","true","4.9"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","29","35","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Taiyz/recommended/378750/","Taiyz","Taiyz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Taiyz/","164 products in account","This is a no-frills port of the PlayStation Vita version of the game. Runs smooth, but functionally it's developed like a lot of Japanese doujin games. Control mapping is basic and assumes you have a controller of some sort, though there are some mysterious keyboard bindings. There are basically no graphical options apart from making the game fit your screen, but simply maximizing the windowed version looks fantastic in my opinion (again, coming from the Vita version.) I'm not a major PC gamer myself, so I'm totally fine with a barebones PC port, this is a series where the gameplay takes center stage after all.\n\nIn terms of the gameplay, this is a platformer/puzzle game with physics-based rope-climbing, except with elastic properties. Unlike many physics-based platformers, it is incredibly intuitive and you feel satisfaction not just by solving the puzzles of navigating each stage, but by simply flinging yourself around and still feeling in control. Fans of the Ninja Rope from the Worms franchise will be very familiar with this kind of gameplay. There are also a handful of boss fights which make for some nice variety. Expect a decent challenge from this game as well, whether you go hunting for backpack collectibles and hidden doors or not!\n\nThe stage design and visuals are very quirky, very Japanese, and all incredibly charming. From the walking fish, to the school supplies, to the bathhouse backgrounds and recognizable beer bottles, it's a colourful game that compensates for the otherwise geometric levels.\n\nThis is a series that's been around since the Super Nintendo days, finally coming to the west in full force, better than ever before. It would be an absolute shame to miss it, even if you're picky when it comes to your PC ports.","October 6, 2015","true","0.2"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/manfromthewall/recommended/378750/","manfromthewall","manfromthewall","http://steamcommunity.com/id/manfromthewall/","97 products in account","The Umihara Kawase series is known for its fun-yet-difficult platforming, and for the most part, hasn't really changed too much in the past 20 or so years. Sayonara Umihara Kawase, the most recent entry to the series (actually released a while back on 3DS and PS Vita), is no different, for the most part. Still, should you pick it up?\n\nGameplay:\nAs stated earlier, the core mechanics of this game aren't all-too different from the old Super Famicom game. Many people describe it as Bionic Commando-esque, in that you use a hookshot-like item to aid in much of your platforming, and I'd say that's quite a good comparison (other than the fact that you can, in fact, jump in this game). Your character wields a fishing hook, which you use to grab onto walls, as well as stun your enemies (which are mostly walking fish). As you progress through the game, or whenever you feel like speedrunning through the levels, you'll eventually have to employ some tricks with your fishing hook to reach various platforms in the game, or help boost you through levels quicker. Some include using your hook to launch yourself into a sprint, swinging around walls/ceilings in the level (which is pretty challenging to do right), etc. It's a lot of fun, once you get used to it, and it's pretty neat to see yourself pull off these weird tricks (see some videos of the gameplay to get a sense of the kind of tricks you can do).\n\nMusic:\nThe music in this game is extremely calming, and catchy. I admit, I found myself trying to beat levels just to uncover more of the soundtrack. In fact, the music of the trailer was one of the things that drew me into this game, in the first place. This is definitely welcome, given the frustrating difficulty of the game. If you've ever played Donkey Kong Country 2, I would liken the use of the music in this game to how Donkey Kong Country 2 used Stickerbrush Symphony (one of my favorite songs from a video game) for its Bramble levels (which were also rather frustratingly difficult).\n\nGraphics:\nSayonara Umihara Kawase provides no way to control the graphical quality of the game, so you're stuck with relatively low resolution graphics (no 1080p, basically). This can be quite annoying, as you'll wind up with pretty pixelated graphics. On the bright side, you do get 60 frames per second, which is a welcome change compared to the 3DS and PS Vita versions of the game (which were locked at 30 frames per second), so the animation is very smooth. The artstyle is also quite decent; backgrounds and levels colorful, and the enemies look quite whimsical in nature. It's not anything amazing, based on my knowledge of anime art (though, I admit, I'm no anime art connoisseur), but it gets the job done.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you want a challenging platformer, and/or are into speedrunning, this game could be of interest to you. I especially recommend this game, if you're a fan of the Umihara Kawase series, as it's more of the same. If you already have the 3DS and/or PS Vita version, I'm not sure this adds too much. Personally, if I already had those versions, I probably wouldn't have bought this on Steam. However, if you'd like to see the game run in 60 fps, have achievements, or possibly make use of the Steam Workshop for it, Sayonara Umihara Kawase might be worth a look, even if you already have the 3DS and PS Vita version(s).","October 7, 2015","true","19.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KurlyBandit/recommended/378750/","KurlyBandit","KurlyBandit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KurlyBandit/","144 products in account","This series is one of my favourites and I'm really pleased about it being released on steam. This is the Vita version of the game without the original super famicom game as a bonus, this means some extra levels that the 3DS version did not have and graphical and performance improvements (better looking models, textures, 60fps instead of 30, more background elements like birds).\n\nThe gameplay of the series is probably best described as a physics based puzzle platformer. But rather than pushing a box onto a button the puzzle part comes from how best to use the fishing lure and the swinging mechanics to get to the end of each stage. It's extremely satiisfying when you swing around to the exit in a way that makes it look like you knew what you were doing. It definitely requires you to get familiar with the controls before you can really get... in the swing of things. The tutorials at the beginning of the game are a bit much though, the original game had small little cutscenes showing an example of how to use swinging that you may not have thought of, but this game likes to completely spell it out in text which slows down the beginning of the game, especially if you are already familiar with how to play. Thankfully these can be turned off in the options\n\nThe swinging mechanics aren't identical between the three games. Personally I'd prefer more horizontal swinging control like the super famicom game had, but these elvels are designed around the physics that are there.\n\nMuch like the other games in the series, the boss fights are some of the worst stages, this is pretty much a result of the controls not being designed for what they want you to be doing in them. There aren't that many in this game, and this game's bosses are much better than the previous games, except maybe the crab.\n\nI still have no idea when the time stop function is supposed to be used, this is not the kind of game where that allows you to carefully plan when to launch your lure, and you can't even launch it when time is stopped so it will mess up your timing more than anything unless you're using the character that slows time instead. Also the quick retry function only works on stages you've already beaten which kind of makes it pointless as if you've already beaten it then you probably don't need to retry that often.\n\nOverall I'd say this is a good port. However there are no resolution options so you have to play in a sub-720p resolution, and you can only map controls according to the vita controls i.e. only two shoulder buttons, which is disappointing because I would have liked to map downwards diagonals to the extra shoulder buttons for extra accuracy.\n\n♥♥♥♥ fields 33, 24, 46, 35, 59 and 54 though.","October 12, 2015","true","7.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

Then you should give this game a gander. If you've played Bionic Commando, then you might know what to expect. I haven't had a chance to play any Bionic Commando games before but I've been told they're similar to a degree.\n\nThe third entry in the Umihara Kawase series, Sayonara Umihara Kawase originally came out for the 3DS in Japan back in 2013 and it was later released outside of Japan over in Europe and North America a year later in 2014. The version we got was localized as Yumi's Odd Odyssey but references to the first two games in the series were kept the same.\n\nIn April of this year, the game was ported to the PS Vita under the name of Sayonara Umihara Kawase Plus, including extra stuff and the original Umihara Kawase that came out on the Super Famicom back in 1994 (both with their own trophy lists).\n\nOn October 6th, 2015, the Plus version was ported to PC, and later in the year both Umihara Kawase and Umihara Kawase Shun will get PC ports as well so now everyone will finally be able to enjoy and experience this series in its entirety.\n\nAs for how the gameplay actually functions, you traverse levels using a fishing rod to swing and propel yourself across, over and under enemies (fish with legs and some bosses like a giant crab or giant tadpole) and platforms, all while trying to get to a door as fast as possible (if you're into speedrunning or leaderboards) while some levels have 2 doors with a harder to reach door acting as a shortcut to get to levels further along the level select screen (sometimes it's necessary to access the second optional door to reach branching paths to get to one of the different bosses).\n\nI probably could've left out most of the info before the part where I talked about how the game plays, but I just wanted to throw in a little extra context. Hopefully more people will get into this wonderful series and enjoy it as much as other people do B^)","October 9, 2015","true","6.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Tutorials are way more intrusive, saying in a thousand words what the original said with a 5-second animation. They've added a bunch of unlockable BS, you can't even throw the hook until you've triggered the tutorial for it. Graphics are much more cluttered; I can't really say they are uglier because the original was ugly as dirt, but they've replaced the dirt with eye-searing colors and a great deal more visual information (depth, scenery, set dressing) that doesn't convey the only two pieces of information that matter: where can I stand, and where can I hook?\n\nBut wait this is a recommendation. Because all that aside, it's still Umihara Kawase. It's still crazy physics, insane jumps, and it does add some important things. There are a lot more options; the options menu is terrible but you can swap controls around, change up the HUD, stuff like that. The original had the ugliest HUD of all time, this one has none or things that are actually useful like showing inputs.\n\nThe game is broken up into ILs that you unlock by reaching them once, no more trying to preserve your precious few lives just to get to the part you want to practice. You have a fast reset (has to be activated in the options) so you can grind levels more easily. This makes it feel a bit more like a modern puzzle-platformer, with none of the "how far can you get" tension that comes with the threat of lost progress.","October 6, 2015","true","6.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Nine minutes!\n\nController is more or less required.\n\nEven with a steam controller, the game suffers from brutal platforming physics.  You should have freedom with the lure / elastic band but it just doesn't work that way.  Stages have a pretty limited set of ways to complete them and those neat looking leaps that you feel like you should be able to easily make, you really can't due to how gravity and the lure work in this game.\n\nAll the surfaces have friction levels that give basic walking and landing a sliding feel.  There are ice platforms too, and those result in total loss of control.  But simple, baseline platforms aren't "tight."\n\nThere are several obstacles that are solvable with a basic jump (no use of the lure),  However the game has no 'mario jump' when coming off the end of a platform.  If your timing is a nanosecond late, you fall and die; many platformers will give you a few frames of a grace period where you can jump off a platform as your characters feet are exiting it.  This game has no equivalent.  It also lacks "edge gravity", so if you see yourself start to fall off a cliff, you won't grab back on with your hands as a "last second save,"\n\nOh well.  At least its < $10, and the music/visuals were ok?","February 8","false","1.3"," 3 of 18 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","3","18","0","2"

The game may seem simple at first however, the stages will become increasingly complex that knowing some classical physics such as a pendulum swing, Newton's Laws of Motion and force vectors could help you figure out some techniques to solve stages. Otherwise, as a last resort go to YouTube to find solutions to a stage.\n\nKeep in mind that the best part about the stages is that they are non-linear, hence there is no unique solution and there are many different ways to get to the exit. To keep challenging yourself, there is survival challenge which is the classic game mode or the option to complete stages with the fastest time by competing in the online leaderboards. You may be shocked watching the methods from some Japanese players on YouTube with how they complete a stage in several seconds or less.\n\nOverall, this is a gem of a game which I compare with the likes of Monster Hunter or Dark Souls with regards to the learning curve which starts off small and then becomes very steep. Maybe that sounds like an exaggeration however, I definitely had to deal with stages where "You Died" for over 2 hours. This takes into account the platforming which ends up requiring more precision as the puzzles become more complex.\n\nLastly for emphasis, use YouTube for solutions as a last resort. Similar to Dark Souls, you would want to figure out how to beat the stages by yourself to get that enjoyment out of beating the game.\n\n","March 26","true","53.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think the Umihara Kawase games are wonderful for anybody who has a high tolerance for frustrating platform/rope physics. It gets very difficult rather quickly, but if that doesn't deter you there's a really fantastic game there.","February 17","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But you shouldn't expect more than that.\n\nThere are:\n- No resolution options\n- No graphical options\n- No files to muck around about to change them in (entire game outside of the OST is in a proprietary .arc format)\n\nI can't recommend this unless it's the ONLY WAY you can play the game. The 3DS and Vita versions are easier on the eyes, though they're not 60fps... But is a 540p upscaled PC game with no options whatsoever worth it for you? That's up for you to decide.\n\nAs of this moment, I can't recommend Sayonara UmiharaKawase on PC.","October 5, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","21"

Unlike other games of its type, the grappling hook physics are pretty complex and will take a while to get used to.  Once you get past the steep learning curve, though, you'll be able to fly through the levels like a champ. Because of the open ended nature of the levels, using your new techniques is very rewarding. You'll see yourself go from struggling on a level for minutes to finishing it in seconds with a couple of well executed swings. It's an incredibly fun game that anyone who is into platformers should play. Or at least if they're fine with the fact that the game runs at Vita's resolution, has no graphical options to speak of and has some sound panning issues.","October 8, 2015","true","50.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This challenging puzzle-platformer is know for its bungie-like fishing line gameplay used to fight off enemies and avoid traps while trying to get to the next stage. In this title Umihara, the main character, isnt alone exploring its bazzare world. Two other playable characters join in that offer a slight variation to the overall gameplay.\n\n\n\nPros:\n\n3 different playable characters with slightly varied abilities along with different costumes for Umihara\nA near faithful port of the PS Vita version that runs at a smooth, consistant 60FPS\nEach of the 60 stages has more than 1 way to can complete each stage, offfering some intense time attacks\nControls and gameplay is easy to grasp but extremely difficult to master getting through the more challenging stages\nThe music, while relaxing and catchy fits the overall feel of the game and also has music you can unlock from the previous 2 games by changing into Umihara's various costumes.\nThe visuals are colorful yet at times somewhat bizzare with its cute, chibi-like astethics\n\n\nCons:\n\nThe Steam port does not include the original Super Famicom Umihara Kawase ( It will be released as a seperate title coming soon to Steam)\nResolution is locked. You can only change the display to either window of full screen.\nThe games nearly unforgiving challenge with test your patience, skills and even your sanity\n\n\nOverall:  This is a huge thumbs up! If you're looking for a challenging, fun, and inexpensive title that will keep you hooked for hours and help scratch that old-school gaming itch, this title is for you. Just be ready to step up your gaming skills if you want to keep yourself from constant deaths and game overs. You have been warned!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","October 14, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can choose between a few different characters, but aside the player model and small differences, the gameplay is the same.\n\nWhile at first it's possible to get frustrated with the swinging mechanics, it feels really satisfying to quickly go through the levels pulling off all different kinds of techniques, as all the levels are built with multiple paths for different levels of expertise, with collectible backpacks scattered across the stages for those who want to go for the extra completion.\n\nThis is a straight port from the PSVita version, but for some reason the original SNES game that was included is now sold separately, so that's a shame. For a better experience, i recommend playing with a controller and using Durante's "GeDoSaTo" tool to make the game look better.\n\nAlso, Noko best girl.","April 29","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
