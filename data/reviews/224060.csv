"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/224060/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Deadpool is an action beat'em up game based on the Marvel Comic book character. The game was developed by High Moon Studios and published by Activision. The title was released on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 in June 2013. Due to a licensing issue, the game was later taken off sale digitally in January 2014, before being re-released on Steam in July 2015. Deadpool will also be seeing a re-released version on the Ps4 and Xbox One in November of 2015.\n\nThe gameplay in Deadpool is a very basic hack and slash style. You have quick and heavy melee attacks, whilst also having a selection of guns to choose from as well. You are able to combine the quick attacks and heavy attacks together to make some interesting yet powerful combinations. Throughout the game you are also able to purchase upgrades and learn further combos allowing you to pull of some spectacular looking attacks in the latter stages of the game. As you pull of more and more complex combos, you are rewarded with more of the in game currency, allowing you again to purchase upgrades, new weapons and side arms, such as grenades and traps for instance.  There is so much to actually upgrade in this game; and you may even find it hard to purchase the majority of the skills too; so it may be wise to plan out how you envisage you playing the game at the very start of your play through - whether it be melee based, or more focused on guns and ranged attacks.\n\nThere is a small element of platforming to be seen in Deadpool, but nothing that gets too annoying, yes the jumping puzzles are very prominent in some stages, but as you get further into the game, you will also learn a teleporting ability which makes small work of any platforming problems.\n\nGraphically, Deadpool takes on the same sort of style as you would expect from the comic book series. Nothing majorly fancy, just your standard looking last generation title. The cut scenes look far worse than the actual gameplay which is something I am becoming increasingly aware of given the fact that they also run in a lower frame rate as well. All of the animations of everything in the game are stellar though, when pulling off the crazy combo attacks, it looks so fluid and I cannot fault the animation in Deadpool in anyway.\n\nThe plot in Deadpool is also very inline as what you would expect if you have any knowledge of the comic book series. Deadpool continuously breaks the fourth wall, referencing you, the player on a frequent basis, making comics on the game design and the developers. Having only read a couple of the Deadpool comic books, I still felt as if I had known this character for years, and even someone who has no knowledge of who Deadpool is, will surely appreciate the comical value on offer here. The lewd comments, the toilet humour and the staple one liners all make an appearance and had my chuckling along throughout my play through.\n\nAt no point throughout the game did I feel challenged though; I was playing on the normal difficulty and really felt a bit let down with the foes in front of me. Once you learn a few combos and upgraded a few bits of equipment, there is really no challenge at all in the fighting scenes as you plough through squads of enemy troops without any issues. I would strongly suggest that you play this game on the highest difficulty to get any sort of challenge out of the gameplay though.\n\nAll of the levels within Deadpool have a lot of items which you can pick up, such as ammo and collectable items and not to mention plentiful amounts of the in game currency to use on them precious upgrades. I found myself at times venturing off the main path just to collect more of this currency and this can sometimes lead to a few little Easter eggs to be found. That being said; there is only one way to complete a level, one entrance, and one exit; a completely linear experience - I didn't find this to be a bad thing; it just would have been nice to see a couple of other ways to complete a few of the stages.\n\nI have played through Deadpool twice now, once when it first came out, and a second one recently. Each play through took me roughly 12 hours to complete; that's quite a long time for a linear single player game of this type, but with the lack of any multiplayer, there isn't any replay ability and no other reason to play through a second time unless you are going to ramp up the difficulty like I did on a second run through.\n\nWhilst playing I had a couple of technical issues, none of them were game breaking problems, just little annoyances. The first one being that sometimes after interacting with an object, whether it be a lever or opening a chest, Deadpool would for some reason start moving in a direction on its own, and it takes a couple of key presses before it stops and you then have control over the character again.  Secondly, there is a huge amount of invisible walls throughout most of the levels too; you can be trying to jump up a wall and suddenly you will hit a wall of nothing and will completely mess up your jumping puzzle just because the developer didn't want you to go down that path. Thirdly, the lack of any graphics options when in game is a real pain as well; you have to completely back out right to the main menu before you can make any changes - this is just annoying and shouldn't be something we see in common day PC releases. I will say though, I did play Deadpool on 4k resolution, with all the graphics setting on max and was able to get a steady 60 fps MOST of the time. I did notice a few drops sub 60, but these were few and far between and only on the highly graphically intensive scenes.\n\nTo sum up, I would simply recommend Deadpool, it's not a fantastic game, but it will certainly wet your appetite for more games of this style. The comical value alone for me made this a worthwhile experience. It is certainly not worth the full price tag of £29.99, no no no no. That is day light robbery right there, the lack of any real replay ability and 12 hour story mode is a real warning sign and you should only consider picking up Deadpool when it goes on sale for anything less than £15. I would also just put it out there; that I would pick it up sooner rather than later before another issue with licensing arises and Deadpool is removed from Steam again - this may only be relevant for game collectors though.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It's about "antihero" called Deadpool (Wade Winston Wilson), disfigured and mentally unstable mercenary with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor. He is known as the "Merc with a Mouth" because of his talkative nature and tendency to break the fourth wall, which is used by writers to humorous effect. This game is not to be taken seriously at any point. Some humor may be rude, offensive and plain bootlegged but it's the nature of Wade (Deadpool), so don't question it and just go with the flow.\n\n[Deadpool]: I think someone's at the door ANCRON.\n[ANCRON]: Oh, really? Can you keep an eye on this?\n[Deadpool]: Yeah, sure.\n[ANCRON]: Thanks man, be right back.\n[Deadpool]: Hmm what we have here, review of my game... hmmm..let's see.\n\n[Deadpool's Inner voice]: Story is about me, Deadpool, of course.. well who else, and some of his "sidekicks", like boring Wolverine, and my BABES Psylocke, Rogue and other low tier heroes. I don't even know why we keep Wolverine, he's short and too serious all the time, real mood killer.. and girls.. well girls have..\n\n[Inner voice 1]: HOLY TITTS!!\n[Deadpool]: Not you again..\n[Inner voice 2]: Hey don't forget me!\n[Inner voice 1]: So we gonna meet Rogue today?\n[Deadpool]: Would be nice.\n[Inner voice 2]: Rogue....\n[Deadpool]: Wonder if she likes pancakes.\n[Inner voice 1]: She will love our pancakes!\n[Inner voice 2]: Yeah.\n[Deadpool]: Well, anyway. Back to my review.\n\n[Deadpool's Inner voice]: I saw Rogue in my dream today, I wonder what she does this evening, will have to call her.\n\n[Inner voice 2]: Yeah would be nice.\n[Inner voice 1]: I love Rogue!\n[Inner voice 2]: Yeah, she's really soft.\n\n[Deadpool's Inner voice]: Let me see... yeah we don't need all that.\n\nGameplay is your basic hack and slash experience, with ranged or melee weapons. You receive experience from defeated enemies as well as randomly scattered XP orbs, that you can find throughout the levels and use to improve, unlock and learn new skills, weapons, etc. Deadpool can use guns, grenades, sais, knives, hammers, katanas and other weapons. You have your basic attacks, special moves and finishers for every weapon type. Attacks with smaller weapons tend to be more faster and do less damage compared to ones with katanas and hammers, and depending on enemy some may be more effective than others.\n\n[Deadpool]: Yeah, yeah.. I punch stuff, stuff falls out and I become stronger and get the BABES!\n[Inner voice 1]: TITTS!!\n[Inner voice 2]: Mmm so soft..\n\nThere's a lot of nasty, rude and simply stupid humor throughout the game.\n[content deleted]\n[Deadpool]: He really like that "throughout" word.\n[Inner voice 1]: Yeah, haha.\n[Inner voice 2]: But he's our friend!\n[Deadpool]: Yeah, but it's my game! Enough of this, just buy it, it's really fun!\n[Inner voice 1]: Yeah we promise!\n[Inner voice 2]: For realz!\n[Deadpool]: He's coming back! Act natural.\n[Inner voice 1]: Oh shh..\n[Inner voice 2]: Hide!!\n\n[ANCRON]: Who were you talking to?\n[Deadpool]: Umm, noone so who was it?\n[Inner voice 1]: He doesn't have a clue what we did!\n[Inner voice 2]: Shhhhh.. he'll hear you.\n[ANCRON]: Well, Psylocke came by. She's free this evening and accepted my invitation to cinema.\n[Deadpool]: WOW! Really?! Cool, second base and all haha! Is Rogue coming too?\n[ANCRON]: Thanks. Well I could ask her, you wanted to come with us?\n[Inner voice 2]: I bet he would, he's been jumping out of his pants for Rogue lately.\n[Inner voice 1]: Haha, his pants, good one.\n[Deadpool]: Hey I don't wear pants!\n[Inner voice 1]: Oh right. Wait what!?\n[ANCRON]: What pants? What are you talking about?\n[Deadpool]: Well pants that I don't wear because I'm in bodysuit, so why would I need pants. So about that call?\n[ANCRON]: Oh, yeah I will as soon as I finish my review.\n\n[Deadpool walks away]\n\n[ANCRON]: What the hell happened to my revie...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/224060/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Deadpool is an over-the-top action adventure game with lots of humor. Yes, it's not the most intelligent humor out there, but it certainly has a couple of hilarious moments. Too bad the gameplay is so generic.\n\nFirst of all, let me start by saying that the game looks great and I really enjoyed the subtle animations of Deadpool. It looked natural so I was pleasantly surprised. Add to that the fantastic voice acting of Nolan North and you have a fun character to play with. The fact that Deadpool is aware that he's in a game makes the game that much more special.\n\nBut despite all that, the gameplay itself is disappointing to say the least. If you ever played an action adventure game before this, you know exactly what to expect. You'll be slashing and shooting enemies for 7-8 hours straight with one or two exceptions. I won't spoil these for you as they make the game a bit better, or more interesting.\n\nCoins can be found all over the levels and slain enemies will drop coins as well. Collecting these allows you to upgrade Deadpool or any of his weapons. It's nothing major and most of us won't even notice the differences, except for the fact that enemies are killed faster.\n\nThe boss fights are uninteresting and the villains aren't even worth mentioning except for Mr. Sinister. On the other hand, the X-Men cameos are much cooler because you'll probably recognize more of those characters (like Rogue and Wolverine). Still, they're only in it for a few short moments so it's not that you'll be seeing them for tens of minutes. But it's still cool.\n\nThe controls could've been tweaked a little more. It generally works ok, but the teleport button is also used for evading attacks. Things can get kinda hectic and sometimes instead of evading you'll just teleport behind your enemies. Awkward.\n\nThere are also a few glitches. Opening treasure chests, for example, glitched A LOT for me. Deadpool would just stand over it and do nothing and no matter how many times I pressed the button the game just wouldn't register it properly. Again, nothing major, but it's still something that should've been fixed before release.\n\nOk, so let me sum things up again: if you're a comic book fan, or more specific, you love Deadpool, this is the game for you. If you love generic action adventures, this is for you. If you love humor and love to play a funny character, again, Deadpool is for you.\nIf you aren't interested in any of these things, well then, Deadpool's not for you. Just do yourself a favor and skip it.\n\n[Rating: 75/100]","June 28, 2013","true","7.8"," 97 of 111 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","97","111","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/224060/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","DeadpoolDeveloper: High Moon Studios\nPublisher: Activision\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nAfter a rather extended vacation, Deadpool is back on Steam. The Merc with a Mouth's own video game is just as you'd imagine: full of blood, weapons, and Deadpool's own unique fourth-wall breaking brand of humor. Oh yes, it's just as fun as you think. But not at full-price. While Deadpool's game is more fun than you can imagine, it's rather short, clocking in at just over 7 hours on my own playthrough - not enough for $39.99.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nAt its core Deadpool is a hack n' slash third person shooter with some platformer elements. You are able to control Deadpool as he wrecks all manner of baddies with his rather underwhelming, yet suitable-for-the-job arsenal of weapons. Deadpool has 3 melee weapons, 4 different types of firearms, and about 5 types of throwables. You can mix light and heavy attacks with your melee weapons to perform all manner of combos, while you can use your guns to take out distant enemies, or perform "gunkata" attacks mid-combo. You can make use of Deadpool's teleporter belt to dodge attacks and even travel short distances later in the game.\n\nEach of Deadpools weapons can be upgraded, unlocking different special abilities and traits using Deadpool Points. These points are gained by defeating enemies, or found laying around in the world. The more enemies you thwomp, the higher your combo count goes. The higher your combo count, the more Deadpool Points you earn. Therefore it's in your best interests to defeat enemies as efficiently and as quickly as possible so you can upgrade your weapons and abilities sooner rather than later. Enemies also drop ammo, which, like Deadpool Points, can also be found laying around.\n\nThere is quite a bit of platforming in the game, and as such Deadpool is able to double jump and later teleport to ledges and platforms over short distances. He is also able to walljump off of buildings, walls, and other things in the environment. This can be used to traverse areas or as a way to get into a more advantageous position during combat.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nAs far as games go, Deadpool doesn't look bad. It's technically last gen, but it looks nice enough. The best parts are the little details. For example, as Deadpool takes damage his suit gets messed up, revealing his cancer-ridden body. If left alone long enough, Deadpool regenerates health, and apparently his suit as well. It's actually pretty cool to sit and watch that happen.\n\nThere is slight variation in enemy designs, but not much. For the most part you will be facing hordes of clones, and there are about 8-10 types. You'll probably get sick of seeing them, but not of blowing them up. Every melee attack or gunshot results in blood going everywhere in very generous amounts.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nFor an action game, the soundtrack's alright. It matches Deadpool's wit and jokes surprisingly well. But it's nothing to write home about. It does it's job, and nothing more. In fact a lot of it is reused quite a bit.\n\nSound effects are a different matter. The gunshots sound very satisfying, especially high rate-of-fire guns. Sword slashes, blood splashing around, bodies piling up...it all sounds so awesome.\n\nPerhaps the best part of the game is the voice acting....the constant jokes and jabs at everything that Deadpool and his 2 inner voices make. Every single line of dialogue from Deadpool is hilarious. The game really stays true to the character.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nThe game runs pretty well, with very few instances of slowdown or lag. I did experience it a few times, but it was short lived. For the most part it ran perfectly and a smooth 60 FPS at nearly all times. I played with a Logitech F310 controller, and it worked very well by default, with no configuration needed. The controls were very smooth and intuitive.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nDeadpool is a fun game for fans of the character, in fact it's a must-have for fans. For all others however, there are better offerings available that offer more playtime. Still, it's a fun game for a while, albeit a bit short. Still, it's friggin' Deadpool. What's not to like?\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/IGZdroM0n2I\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nRecommended\nIf you liked this review or found it helpful, please consider rating it up.

Deadpool is aware of the fact that he is inside his own video game at all times, so a lot of the dialogues revolve around this fact and he will often speak to or about you (the player) directly, which makes for some hilarious conversations between him and other characters in the game, such as X-Men like Wolverine or Rogue.\n\nHUMOR\nThe basic story alone could hardly carry the game, so an essential part of what makes the game so much fun are the hilariously stupid dialogues and tons of WTF-moments. The humor in the game is often pretty immature but fits like a glove for a whacky character such as Deadpool and actually made me almost spill my drink more than once. It's entertainment on a relatively low level, but perfect for an hour or two when you just want to turn your brain off and have some fun.\n\nVISUALS\nObviously being a console port, the game doesn't offer many PC-specific graphics settings apart from brightness, fullscreen, resolution, VSync and graphics presets (low, medium, high, extra), but despite this fact the game still looks pretty good and runs smooth with only a few occasional FPS drops. Level and character design is also pretty decent for what it is.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe gameplay basically consist of fast-paced close combat and while you do have a couple ranged weapons such as pistols, shotguns or rifles, the focus definitely lies on your melee weapons. Unfortunately, there are only 3 of them: Swords, Sais and Hammers. Another unfortunate thing is that the combat as such feels rather weak and uninspired. While there generally is nothing wrong with fighting waves after waves of enemies, it gets quite repetative when you execute the same moves over and over again because there aren't any combos or special moves to bring in some variety. You do have a couple special attacks that can be unleashed by filling up your Momentum-Meter, but it takes quite a bit to fill it up and the attacks as such don't really feel powerful or devastating enough to really make a difference.\n\nYou can extensively upgrade all of your weapons and Deadpool directly via DP points (gained by collecting them in the levels or killing enemies), but most of the upgrades feel like they have very little or no effect on the combat or the damage you deal. A game like this could've really used some epic and devastating weapons or upgrades where you both see and feel what a huge damage they deal.\n\nBetween the fighting areas there are occasional stealth sequences (with the most hilarious sneaking character animation in a video game ever, btw) where you can take out enemies silently with some pretty gorey finishing moves.  Furthermore, there are a couple minigames, puzzles and dream-like sequences in the game. None of them are really essential for the story or the game as such, but they give you a bit time to take a breath from the fast-paced action and some of them, such as a sidescrolling platformer minigame, add a nice bit of change to the gameplay.\n\nPLAYTIME & REPLAYABILITY\nThe story consists of 8 fairly lengthy levels and beating the game on Veteran difficulty took me roughly 8 hours, which I consider a decent enough playtime for a game like this. Apart from replaying the story for the LOL-factor, you can try your luck in one of the 8 Challenge maps to fight your way to the top of the online leaderboards. 2 more challenge maps are available through the Merc with a Map Pack DLC, but if you're not into wave-based challenge modes, you probably can save the money. Other than that, there's nothing else to do in the game.\n\nCONCLUSION\nDeadpool is fun. Plain and stupid fun.\nIf you expect an immersive and touching story, profound characters or challenging gameplay that will put your skills to the test, this game is definitely not for you. If you want a couple hours of brainless entertainment, look no further and get this game!","December 26, 2013","true","7.8"," 47 of 50 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","47","50","0","1"

the voice acting in this game is amazing mainly just for the voice actor of Deadpool as he really bring the character of Deadpool to life straight out of the comics\n- Jokes/Comedy - this game has a great amount of jokes that'll make you laugh out loud, and allow for some really funny and just straight up weird but amazing moments in campaign\n- Whose that -  during the campaign you'll meet some characters from the comics and upon meeting them for the first time you can hit spacebar or A if your using a controller to see a very quick and funny history of the character with pictures from the comics, that feature alone really helped me understand some of the characters that I was introduced to upon playing this game\n- Runs Pretty Smoothly - the game runs pretty good though it crashed about 3-4 times during my first 4 hours but after that I haven't had any issues since\n- Regenerating Suit - now not that many people have noticed this but as you take damage in game your suit begins to fall apart just about everywhere, but it slowly reforms at a pace so slow that you'll barely notice, that's just something random that I enjoyed in the game\n\nCons- Short Campaign - the game has about a 6-10 hour campaign, extremely short\n- Linear Campaign - the campaign is filled with great jokes to make it interesting but it relies on the comedy factor so much that it dumbs down the story, in which you as Deadpool have to kill the big bad known as Sinister, who makes tons of clones of himself and other villains to try to stop you and conquer the world, which is terrible because you end up killing him about 3-4 times in different missions and then in the final level you kill about 45 of him\n- Campaign Difficultly Spike - if your like most people than you'll be able to get through the standard/regular campaign in no problem, that is until you get through the final mission, now I'm one of the rare people that beat this mission without dying on my first try in some insanely lucky way, you start the mission and out of nowhere you just get thrown about 25 waves of enemies, after you somehow manage to do that then you face the previous bosses all at the same time and then after that if you make it out alive then you have to fight the main villain of the game in about 10 extremely difficult waves killing about 20 of him each wave, only to see the real one die in a cutscene, this ending is a slap in your face is extremely lazy and terrible ending to a game, that will leave you pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off\n- Repetitive Gameplay - this game has some of the most annoying repetitive gameplay I've ever played, you just hack and slash with swords or hammers, or use a combination of guns, X for light attack Y for heavy, and then B to counter/escape which is horrible because if your stuck between tons of enemies and then you want to teleport out of there you may just end up countering someone then being stuck and beaten up by all of them for a minute straight, the game also tries to add a stealth aspect that you use about 2-3 times in the game so it's basically pointless\n- Terrible Soundtrack - upon first start up of the game you'll hear some bad rock music and there you go, thats the entire music of this game pretty much\n- 4 Types of enemies - in the game you'll have a very limited amount of basic henchmen, guys with guns, guy with 2 knives, guy with big sword, and the rare guy with shield/damage buff, and the extremely rare big guy with a big gun, all of these guys together in a fight don't offer as much of a challenge as it sounds, you basically just hack and slash all day\n- NO Replay Value - this game has a very short campaign with just about no replay value what-so ever, apart from achievements which is why I have a lot more hours in the game, there's no point in replaying the main campaign due to that fact that it's no longer that fun because you already know all of the jokes and such, and because its just terrible, though the game tries to offer a challenge map system similar to the Arkham games but it's extremely difficult and if you somehow ever manage to beat all 3 levels on a challenge map under the ridiculous time limit, then you get to play with a special Deadpool skin only exclusive to that map that you will most likely never play since you finally beat it\n- 3 YEAR OLD GAME COSTS $40!?!?! - are you seriously kidding me here this game costs $40 and its 3 years old!! Now that wouldn't be a problem if the game was worth it but it comes nowhere near the value of a $40 game, the worst part about this is that the game used to be on steam for $20, Activision removed it off Steam and added it back on for $40, like WTF mate even on the next gen like Xbox-One it's $30 new, and $20 new on the Xbox 360, so why the actual #### are they screwing over PC, even though I bought it on sale for $20 I still feel ripped off, the game in total is worth about $10-$15 or $5 on sale, the current price is insane for a extremely repetitive 6 hour game, you'll be lucky if you can even get 12 at most unless you replay for achievements\n\nFinal VerdictThough I found very many issues with the game left and right slowly frustrating me more and more, the amazing voice acting and comedy in the game is sooo good that it almost balances all of the negatives that I listed, not all of them though, my Final Verdict for Deadpool is a 6/10, if your a huge Deadpool fan than this is a must have though don't even touch it for $40 wait for it to be on sale or wait until the price drops and then till gets on sale, if you enjoyed this review please make sure to leave a thumbs up and to check out my other game reviews, and thank you for your time","February 23","false","16.7"," 99 of 134 people (74%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","74","99","134","9","2"

I liked this game for the humor but not so much for the gameplay.\n\nFirst of all, what kind of price is that? This is why I hate Activision. This should be worth something like 20$ or less, especially for its lenght.\n\nMelee weapons are weak and clunky while guns can deal massive damage with a headshot and the shotgun is overpowered. It's like melee weapons are only made to stun enemies so you can finish them. Counter-attacking is also very badly made, useless and you keep teleporting instead because it's the same button as teleporting. Most of the game is just endless waves of the same enemies over and over and it gets tiring.\n\nThe game is short and doesn't have much replayability except for maxing up all weapons after finishing the game, and then it's just hearing the same jokes a second time.\n\nThe only reason to really get this game is for Deadpool and the humor. It's funny and random and you're always excited to see what is the next surprise.\n\nRecommended for Deadpool fans who can enjoy a mediocre game but not recommended for people expecting a good hack'n slash. Never buy it on full price, this is Activision ♥♥♥♥ right there, it's just a short game, not a AAA game.\n\nPros :\n-Deadpool\n-Funny and random\n\nCons :\n-One of the worst hack'n slash gameplay I have ever played\n-No real plot\n-Very Short\n-Overpriced\n-No replayability","July 16, 2015","false","17.8"," 233 of 349 people (67%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","67","233","349","13","15"

The  humor in the game is  a refereshing change from most   games that I play and the combat is  pretty simple to pick up using  a combination of a couple of keys.  Using these see''s your Katana's flying like the wind, with  Witcher  like sword trails  abounding.\n\nEnemies do  seem rather easy to  despatch at  first, but   you'll soon  be  trying to dodge bullets to survive.  Thankfully one of your attributes is a teleport sytem, which enables you to move around   randomly.  The upgrade system is straighforwards, collect the tokens  throughout the game world, that are equivalent to cash. These can then be spent on  upgrading  your weapons and buying new ones.  Skills are unloked on the way.\n\nGraphically the game looks excellent and, more importantly, so  far no glitches.\n\nI'd certasinly recommend this to  anyone into super heroe type games,It's a decent price in the US, CIS and UK, but  the EU is paying way over the odds at 63% above the  average price, wheras, unusually Australia is getting it 25% cheaper than most places.","June 26, 2013","true","5.7"," 39 of 49 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","39","49","0","1"

Deadpool is now in his own video game and he has to kill Mr. Sinister and he meets a few familiar faces along the way.\n\nDeadpool is hack and slash game with guns. Not to mention the game breaks the 4th wall constantly and the game flow changes from a typical hack and slash into a platforming game and then into a top down 8 bit game. The gameplay is this games biggest weakness as it get's boring incredibly fast as nothing is really changed up during the fighting segments. Even the boss fights are the same as the regular enemies. The bosses only have a bigger health bar and that's pretty much it.\n\nDeadpool's biggest strength is the amazing script and Nolan North's voice work as Deadpool. This game had me smiling and laughing the entire time and I loved every minute of it (I'm a big Deadpool fan btw).  Deadpool fans will absolutely love the comedy in this game.\n\nThe cameos from different X-men are also awesome. Seeing faces like Wolverine and Rouge and Psylocke is just awesome and the comedy Deadpool spews about them is also incredibly awesome if you know the backstory and if you don't you get the option to hear about them in a recap narrated by Deadpool himself.\n\nThe game took me 5 hours to finish and apart from the one playthrough there is not much replay value as nothing really changes up. Not to mention there's no new game plus so you can't take the upgrades you got during the first time playing and import them in the second playthrough.\n\nThere are challenge maps, but those get incredibly boring incredibly fast so unless you plan on getting a 100% I don't recommend playing them.\n\nDeadpool is also quite easy for the most part. There are some hard parts, but nothing incredibly difficult you won't be able to finish.\n\nThe game ran incredibly well. I got a stable 60 FPS and max settings and never had trouble, so I doubt people will run into trouble.\n\nFor the current price, I really can't recommend buying Deadpool as much as I love the character. The game while is fun and incredibly funny, it's way too short for 30 euros. If you can get it for a discount, I highly suggest giving it  a chance.  And if you love Deadpool this is a must own  for the comedy itself. I enjoyed the game a lot and I would recommend buying it at a discount.\n\nFinal Rating:\n7.5/10 - Worth Buying on a discount\n\nIf you liked this review please give it a thumbs up and if you disliked, post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 10, 2015","true","5.5"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","22","29","4","0"

While fun at times, it does it get too repetitive. Also very linear which may suit you or not. There is an upgrade system for Deadpool in terms of player attributes, and weapon upgrades which cost skill points which you earn for dispatching enemies. The game is what you would expect if you know anything about the character Deadpool at all. He is self concious of the audience and the enviroment and breaks the the 4th wall. Which makes things funny and unexpected at times. Graphics are fine for this type of game. If you have played Origins: Wolverine, this game is similar to that. The standard price is too much for this game, so I would wait till it goes on a really good discount if you decide to get this. Then again this game was published by Activision who never really give good discounts on their games unfortunately. So it's up to you how much you like the character Deapool, and want to play with him....hehe.","May 6","true","12.6"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

The writing and its comedic timing and meta humor makes it incredibly fun, and cutscenes are always a blast. The game has several game development jokes as well, mostly centered around the budget. And the plot? Well, don't expect a strong magnum opus from High Moon Studios; just go with the flow!\n\nSadly, the writing is wrapped in gameplay that's mediocre and tedious, at best. The enemy types are very similar (which the game chalks up to clones of Mr. Sinister) but the way fights are designed can be frustrating due to the types and amounts thrown at you at specific times. It also doesn't help the camera hugs Deadpool like his favorite fangirl, because it limits the view and so frustrations can rise when enemies appear out of nowhere to destroy you. Of course, you have a healing factor, which helps, but not enough to assuage frustrations. And don't even get me started on the last level with old boss Mr. Sinister. Imagine all the enemy types you've just fought, multiplied by 2. Even all the annoying ones. His lackeys were MORE annoying that the final boss himself!\n\nStill, I do recommend the game (barely) for the writing and voice acting alone. But I think the current price point of $20 is way too high for the game. Get it under $8 if you can, because the gameplay does drag down this otherwise Deadpool approved game.","February 13","true","7.3"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","2"

It's fun, but the combat got monotonous and the jokes were super repeptitive. When I made the jump to PC, the graphics were already a ton better, the jokes seemed more spread out evenly for some reason, I hardly heard the same one-liners more than a few times. The combat was also refreshing and a little less clunky and boring. I dunno what they did, but it's great.\n\nOverall, the game is about a 7 for me still. The enemy archetypes are practically the same throughout the game, and once you unlock the power upgrades for your weapons you're basically unstoppable. Then again, this is ♥♥♥♥in' Deadpool we're talking about here.

Some, however, do not.\n\nThe combat is pretty straight-forward. Button-mashing... WITH STYLE! It's pretty similar to the Batman games (in my opnion).\nThroughout the game, you can purchase other weapons, and then upgrade them, keeping things interesting. Also, Dual-Shotguns. Why... ...Would you NOT want that. The enemies are usually somewhat the same and can get repetitive at times.\nAnd sometimes the game is suprisingly difficult.\n\nThe story is very Deadpool-esque. Most of the joke are very funny, with the exception of a few immature ones. But that's because Deadpool IS (at times) immature. Nolan Norths (voice of Deadpool) voice acting is incredible, and how one would imagine Deadpool to actually sound.\n\nThe graphics are that of a 2009-20011 game, which in my opnion isn't awfull. It's just not AMAZING, But not game changing (in my opnion).\n\nThe music... Really does get annoying sometimes. The same old thing, mostly during combat.\n\nThe game is rather short, delivering 9 hours of gameplay for me. Others have had it done in 7 (I also messed around in hoard mode, however).\n\nIf you have never heard of Deadpool ever, you may hate the game (However some have played it and loved it, no guarantees.). But if you love Deadpool like myself, you will most likely enjoy this game. If it's on sale for 10.00, I'd say you're getting your money's worth. Anything else depends on how much you like Deadpool (I pre-ordered it.).\n\nOverall, what I personally thought of the game, was a 7.8 out of 10. But that will most likely differ between the player.\n","December 1, 2013","true","9.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

What else do you need to know?\n\nOh, fine, here's a real review.\n\nDeadpool is a very fun action/FPS game featuring the Merc with a Mouth as the main character. The game begins with Deadpool sitting in his apartment listening to a voicemail message from a game developer, who reluctantly agrees to create a game featuring Deadpool. "Reluctantly," because at first he doesn't want to make the game but is forced to relent when Deadpool blows up his office.\n\nAs you can see, from the very beginning of the game Deadpool is breaking the fourth wall as he talks about being in a video game, and there are a ton of Easter eggs for comic book fans (including the fact that Deadpool owns an autographed copy of New Mutants #98, his first appearance).\n\nThe game quickly progresses into a bloodbath as our favorite mercenary jumps into action scenes one after another, with only a few short cutscenes to tell the story and the rest relying on gameplay. The action is a ton of fun, as you get to control Deadpool and use an entire arsenal of weapons including Katana, Sai, hammers, pistols, SMGs, a Shotgun, and even Cable's plasma rifle from the future. All the weapons need to be unlocked using points that you earn along the way, except for the sword and pistols that you start out with. As you unlock new weapons, you can also upgrade the ones you have, as well as upgrading Deadpool himself with extra HP, higher attack power, and a ton of other upgrades. This gives the game almost an RPG-like feel, since you can build up Deadpool however you like with tons of upgrade options. But it's not an RPG, which is a good thing in this instance because an RPG just wouldn't fit with Deadpool's style. He's a fighter, and the vast majority of your time playing the game will be spent in action levels shooting and slicing bad guys to pieces.\n\nSome people have criticized the action in this game for being too repetetive, but I haven't found this to be the case. Yes, it gets a little bit repetetive, just like every other fighting game in the world, but there is a good enough variety of combos and weapons to use that it won't get boring. Some enemies require different tactics too. For example, most normal enemies can usually be killed fairly easily by just charging in and attacking while paying attention to which ones are about to attack you so you can counter. However, some enemies will block your attacks so you have to mix up your attacks so they won't see what's coming. And many bosses require a bit of strategy, dodging their attacks with your teleporter then shooting them from afar or needing to run away for a while until your healing factor kicks in. Overall, the action sequences are a ton of fun in my opinion.\n\nThe soundtrack is great. The upbeat hard rock music gives the game a hectic, fast-paced feel, and you can always tell when enemies are around because the music gets faster and louder.\n\nGraphics look spectacular. Deadpool himself looks amazing, the perfect blend of comic book style crossed with a touch of realism. The enemies are standard comic book grunts, all looking exactly alike and some are even called "clones." The levels look pretty good, although they can get a bit busy and hard to navigate at times.\n\nSpeaking of level design, this is a very linear game. There are a few places where you can run around, but for the most part, the game gives you a set path that you have to follow with little room to maneuver. This aspect reminds me of Mass Effect, how there are a few open spaces but you always know exactly where the game wants you to go next. One thing I wasn't expecting that turned out to be a happy surprise was the presence of a few "puzzle" areas, where you need to figure out how to get from point A to point B using interactive mechanisms and the level around you. These areas are executed brilliantly, with enough puzzle to make you scratch your head from time to time, but enough guidance to keep it from being frustrating.\n\nThe story is exactly what you'd expect if Deadpool wrote a video game: convoluted and crazy, but coherent enough to follow. But the best part is all the humor thrown throughout. For example, at one point of the game you take control of Deadpool as he slaps Wolverine repeatedly, trying to wake him up after a plane crash. You can keep slapping him for several minutes, and he keeps saying things like "That was for being a jerk! That was for never letting me fly the X-plane! And that was just to see how long the player will keep hitting the button!" In a few places, Deadpool talks directly to the player, and throughout the game you get to hear the various voices inside his head telling him what they think about the situations. These are the kind of jokes that even non-fans can appreciate.\n\nOverall, this is a very fun game that shouldn't be taken too seriously. If you come into it expecting a serious action drama, you'll be sadly disappointed. But if you love Deadpool and know what to expect, then you'll have the time of your life. 10/10 for Deadpool fans, 8/10 for anyone who doesn't already know who Deadpool is and what he's all about.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jarvis4444/recommended/224060/","Jarvis4444","KoalaBear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jarvis4444/","608 products in account","Playing through Deadpool feels about as schizophrenic as its main character. On the one hand, it’s zany, wacky, goofy, silly, sophomoric, and many more adjectives that Thesaurus.com suggests. This is a funny game – that is, if you’re into ♥♥♥♥ jokes and casual sexism. If not, then Deadpool – the character and the game – will grate on you like a buzzsaw on hard cheese.\n\nOn the other hand, much of the Deadpool gameplay experience is formulaic and safe…so safe you might think developer High Moon Studios is playing some sort of self-referential “hey, isn’t it ironic how normal this is?” meta-gag on you. But it’s not. No, Deadpool talks a big game but delivers a standard action experience that is the turducken of videogame parody: It is what it parodies what it is.\n\nFor those not familiar with the glory of the one and only “Merc with a Mouth,” the spandex-clad Deadpool is himself a parody of an anti-hero. A mainstay of Marvel Comics, he was given a healing factor by the Weapon X boys (the same ones who adamantium-ized Wolverine) in an experimental procedure that left him certifiably insane – and self-aware that he is in fact a comic book character. For that reason, Deadpool also knows he’s a videogame character. In fact, he starts the story – what little there is – by forcing High Moon to make a game about him and then throws out the script it sends over to him for approval. It’s a fittingly insane approach that’s true to Deadpool’s character, even if it doesn’t make for a strong story.\n\nArmed with guns, katanas, and an unhealthy love for chimichangas, Deadpool pokes fun at videogame clichés and tropes almost as much as he pokes bad guys with sharp objects. It’s pretty obvious that Deadpool’s writers had a blast bringing this character into interactive 3D; he regularly has arguments with the voices in his head, and at one point can hop on word bubbles emanating from his diseased mind to cross a toxic river. At one point, you can even instigate a creepy stalker situation between a dialogue tree option and yourself. It’s pretty inventive, clever stuff that’s made even more enjoyable by Nolan North’s very enthusiastic delivery as the voice of Deadpool.\n\nBut then there’s the little matter of the repetitive gameplay. In pseudo Batman-style, you can chain together combos with a mix of melee and shooting combat that, while not exactly bad, starts off uninteresting and grows more stale the longer you play. It can be fun slicing into a henchman one second before finishing him off with a shotgun blast to the head, but there’s not enough variety in attacks and tougher enemies can seem unreasonably resistant to your relentless hacking.\n\n10/10","August 5, 2015","true","8.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

On its surface it's an open area, weapons-based fighter that mixes melee combat and gunplay a la Devil May Cry, but with Deadpool's brand of self-aware, attention deficit disordered, crazy humor.\n\nWe'll start with the good: the game is pretty funny. Sure, the humor is often off-color and Deadpool as a character isn't for everyone, especially not those with delicate sensibilities regarding language and treatment of women. I can't recall anything that I would descibe as anything more than "sophmoric", so if you can tolerate some anatomical and potty humor or just roll your eyes and let it roll off your back, you're set to enjoy the better parts of what Deadpool has to offer. The voice work deserves the majority of the credit for the positive light in which I'm able to view the story, since the writing isn't particularly special. Nolan North pulls off Deadpool's gags more effectively than I expected, and the other voice actor's do a commendable job as well.\n\nMechanically the game is largely solid but suffers from a few issues. You have two buttons dedicated to melee attacks, two buttons involved in the shooting of guns, a jump and a teleport/counter button. You also get an extremely spastic camera that you can try to rein in with the right analog stick.\n\nGood luck with that.\n\nYou'll be attacked by groups of enemies that you'll fight off by mashing light and heavy attacks plus a direction to move quickly from one to the next in order to fight the group. You can pepper in some gunplay, but in my experience it didn't fit easily into the combo system due in part of the unreliable camera and the game's tempermental lock-on system. The combat feels a little like Devil May Cry and Batman: Arkham Asylum's lovechild, but it doesn't manage to be as satisfying as either of its inspirations. It's certainly serviceable, though, and I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy wading into crowds of clone soldiers and managing long combo strings.\n\nThe problem is that you're going to be doing quite a lot of it. The developers did manage to mix things up a little bit with some fun, gimicky humor levels like a top-down Zelda style sequence and a 2D platformer, which serve as a nice break. That all aside, though, the core of the gameplay is still running into an area and dealing with the endless horde of clones that will pour out to deal with you. The fact that Deadpool addresses it in his incidental dialogue is appreciated, but doesn't keep it all from feeling a little stale by the end of the game. And hey, speaking of the end of the game there's a pretty severe late game difficulty spike that feels a bit out of place. More enemies will be equipped with devestating ranged attacks that will end you very quickly unless you can bypass their friends to take them out first.\n\nIn the final sequences of the game you'll face a frustrating boss gauntlet. Thought it was annoying when Arclight slowed you and then threw you into the air to pound you? You won't feel any better about it when Blobkbuster is charging at you throwing boulders and Vertigo is standing on a ledge just kinda being Vertigo. I played through the entire game aware of its cracks and shortcomings, but feeling happy to ignore them and enjoy the spectacle until these final, frustrating moments. In the end I think that speaks to a largely positive experience, so I'm recommending Deadpool with some reservations. As long as your expectations are in the right place, Deadpool is a fun way to kill seven or so hours.","December 4, 2013","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was aiming for your crotch."\n\nDo you like lowbrow humour? Are you okay with average (but solid) gameplay? If so, Deadpool is for you.\n\nThe set up is rather absurd: Deadpool wants to create (well, direct) and star in his own game. After negotiating, or, more accurately, blackmailing High Moon studios, he is given the green light. Thus begins Deadpool's fight against waves upon waves of thugs. At his disposal are his signature pistols and katana, as well as several other weapons, including a sledgehammer and shotgun. As you use them, they become upgradeable, increasing their damage and efficiency. It's all run of the mill stuff, really.\n\nIt is a standard action game, barring the humour. The level design is uninspired (Caves/Ruins/Sewers), the combat is decent but not outstanding, the story is alright.\n\nIf it weren't for Deadpool's quips and his general insanity, I'm not sure whether I would have finished it.

The characters and Deadpool himself were great and Deadpools antics had me laughing a few times as well. But while the story and characters were good, the gameplay was easily the let down. It was decent not very good but nothing wrong with it either. It just left me feeling like it could have been a lot better. The game was also quite linear and not very long either. If the story hadn't been as entertaining to me I doubt I'd have played through to the end.\n\nThe game also features a progression system that allows you to upgrade Deadpools abilities and even get him new equipment. You do this by spending DP points which you earn as you defeat enemies (the higher the combo you have also multiplies how many bonus points you get when you've cleared a particular area of enemies). The upgrade system was nice but I certainly felt like half of the things you could buy for him were a bit pointless. As far as weapons I used the sais after I unlocked them and didn't touch his katanas again, and I only used the hammers at the end when their higher damage really counted. Same with the guns, pistols were great for range and shotguns were great up close. The SMG's and the Pulse Rifles felt like they really had no place.\n\nThe final point I will cover is the difficultly spike at the end. I played on the standard difficutly and though I died a few times I never found the game to be more than slightly challanging at a few points. But at the end of the game you find yourself in this sort of arena situation where tougher and tougher enemies are thrown at you in waves with an increasing number of them in each wave leading up to the climax of the game. The problem is that it was a massive jump in difficultly right at the end and I actually died a decent amount in this segment, It really came out of no where and it felt really out of place.\n\nOverall for $10 I feel like it was worth it, but having said that I wouldn't feel the same if I had paid anymore for this game. Wait for $10 or cheaper even if you are a big deadpool fan.","December 5, 2013","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I was aiming for your crotch."\n\nDo you like lowbrow humour? Are you okay with average (but solid) gameplay? If so, Deadpool is for you.\n\nThe set up is rather absurd: Deadpool wants to create (well, direct) and star in his own game. After negotiating, or, more accurately, blackmailing High Moon studios, he is given the green light. Thus begins Deadpool's fight against waves upon waves of thugs. At his disposal are his signature pistols and katana, as well as several other weapons, including a sledgehammer and shotgun. As you use them, they become upgradeable, increasing their damage and efficiency. It's all run of the mill stuff, really.\n\nIt is a standard action game, barring the humour. The level design is uninspired (Caves/Ruins/Sewers), the combat is decent but not outstanding, the story is alright.\n\nIf it weren't for Deadpool's quips and his general insanity, I'm not sure whether I would have finished it. Your mileage will definitely vary, based on how much you enjoy his sense of humour. He kept me laughing throughout, so overall, I'm glad I played it.\n\n+Deadpool is hilarious\n+The cameos are great\n\n-Awful level design\n-Repetitive gameplay\n-Enemies have too much health, in my opinion\n-Little enemy variation\n\nIf you're a fan of the Deadpool character and aren't too concerned by mindless killing,  it's not a bad purchase. Otherwise, I would steer clear.","October 7, 2013","true","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

But it when on sale on steam for pretty cheap. So I thought, "Why not?". Now that I have completed the main story. I can say the game is worth giving a shot. The combat might not be innovative, and is a bit repetitive. But the game is short, that by the time I got bored of it was near the end. A lot of Marvel and Deadpool fans have praised the game for how it stays true to Deadpool's character. Nolan North really shines through as the voice of Deadpool. If you're looking for the next advancement in the hack and slash genre with innovative combat, you will be disappointed. But if you're looking for a fun short game based on an insane comic book character with crude and adult humor.

It was great seeing some other x men characters in there which provided some great nostalgic moments. also the game is hilarious with deadpool breaking the 4th wall all the time. voice acting is good the music is pretty good as well i am hoping some one will upload it. The gameplay is a hack n slash and tps and it was fun It was a blast and using weapons man man it was fun as hell. if there were something to criticize the game is short and doesn't offer a lot to replay and it can get repetative but for 40$ you can't expect a whole lot so I really dig this game.\n\n8.5/10 This game was a blast to play with it's basic yet fun as hell gameplay.","June 29, 2013","true","21.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

If you are into comics you know plenty about him. For those of you who don't. Time to do some reading or watch Wolverine Origins. They skim over the story of Deadpool aka Wade Wilson. Personally he's one of my favorite Marvel heroes/villians. Now lets talk about the game.\n\nDeadpool the game, is action packed, full of chimichanga goodness. The humor is this game is done quite well and so is the story. The game is about 5 hours long a little short but they throw in a challenge mode to add a few more hours of game-play. The only thing that bothers me about the game is the repetitive combat. Its fresh at the beginning but towards the end its very bland and boring after wave, after wave and wave of enemies. Deadpool's commentary is refreshing during these times and is funny towards the player, being a source of encouragement yet being sarcastic.\n\nShould you pick up Deadpool? I would say yes. If you like Deadpool I highly recommend this game to you. If your not a fan of Deadpool you will find his humor dark, immature ,and probably annoying. He will grow on in time though, hopefully.

As a spectacle fighter, the game mechanics are very simple & average, a lot of the levels are boring & visually unimpressive, there's really nothing special going on here.\n\nHowever, if you are a fan of Deadpool, even a casual one, you'll have a blast with this game. The comedy is absolutely spot on & they nailed the character portrayal perfectly. What I love about this is everything is actually directed by & seen through Deadpool's eyes. Usually when I see Deadpool depicted in other forms of media apart from comics, he shows up & acts nuts, simply just being there to add a little comedy to the game.  But in this everything in the game is 100% Deadpool, tons of obsessing over boobs, ♥♥♥♥ jokes, comedic yet ultra violent kills & tons more that all comes out of left field.\n\nMy absolute favourite part of Deadpool is that its a video game. Yeah that sentence does not make a lot of sense but let me elaborate. The whole plot of the game is Deadpool wanting High Moon studios to make a video game starring him, he realizes he's in a game & frequently speaks with the head of High Moon studios, complaining about the level he's in so that it can be changed immediately. Deadpool riffs on game design, QA testing, artists, other games & even has a phone call with Nolan North. If you are involved in the game industry you will have an appreciation of this game & its jokes that others may not.\n\nI don't want to give more than that away but as I've already stated it's simple: Deadpool as a game is average, but for fans it's a must play. It's full of amazing references to more than just Marvel comics, its hilarious, & you will most definitely have a fun time. It's upsetting to me that this game did not sell as well as Activision wanted, which made them decide to put High Moon on Call Of Duty work, as a big fan of three of their games now this may be the last title that is truly from them.","August 17, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Really fun, Great comments, amusing scenes, great voice-actors and nice graphic.\nIt's great in entertainment and is through and through fun. (Yay! *clapping hands of joy*)\n\nBUT! dom dom dooom!\nIf you are that kind of person (like myself) who likes a challenging game,  a long(er) story, and a nice key layout, then this game is *not* for you! This game is not challenging at all, it does not provide a story-line which tells you anything about anything (though it does have these short little comic clips that tells a bit about certain characters), and the game is more or less over before you know it. It all in all seems more like a cut-out chapter of a full game than an actual full game. You can probably finish this game in about 2-3 hours (or maybe less) the first time you play through. -- Which, in my opinion, is pretty bad, especially because the game is so fun and entertaining. The game has only a few short chapters and it seems like there could've been so much more. As for the keyboard layout -- it's just about as silly and senseless as the character you control. Using mouse as most games, and the w,a,s,d for movement is fine, but then there's the other buttons that just seems like the developers dropped a handful of random letters and said "those shall be the keys of which thou shall press to do stupid things!" Of couse you can change the keys in the settings but you are limited to the in-game existing keys, which means that you can only switch out what some of the keys do. *sigh* "purdy damn annoying".\n\nSO big question is: Should you play this game?\nYES! cause its fun and if you're strange, then you won't feel strange compared to your character\nThe second BIG question: Is it worth the money?\n... nyeah -- I'd say nope to that. If this game cost about 14$/13€, sure it would be worth it.\nSo unless you have more money than you care for, wait till it gets on sale.\n\nSo the conclusion is?\nIf you like silly fun stuff and like to chop people to pieces and say senseless things while doing so, then YES! You should definitely get this game! -- But wait till it gets cheaper or comes on sale or you might be disappointed.\nBut when it does, be sure to get it and have fun! :D\n\nI'd like to give this game a thumbs up cause of the "fun factor" but also a thumbs down due to the lack of story and playtime.

Deadpool is a snarky out-of-his-mind nearly indestructible super....smartass.  He has a comment for everything and it doesn't always land him in good graces.  Many would find this to be adolescent humor with self indulgence of a discretionary budget.  For a modest price, it's button mashing mayhem with commentary that will amuse some and irritate others.  The movement seems fluid, although it does get tiresome on a keyboard/mouse combo.  I would recommend this if you catch a Steam sale or are a fan of Deadpool.  The lack of weaponry and some camera control issues do bring down the whole experience.  There are times when it feels like the scenery is as empty as the prop bookcase he comments on in his apartment.  7/10 for an amusing, if not deeply exciting, experience.","December 29, 2013","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay isn't as deep as say, Bayonetta, but it is still satisfying to build up combos and level up your skills and weapons. The jokes keep coming and it makes u keep playing to see what will Deadpool do next.

Caigan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/caigan/","1158 products in account","A lot of friends have asked me for a recommendation on this game, so I'll lay it out.\n\nTHE BADLANDS\nThe enemies are mediocre, dime a dozen, and have VERY little variety.\nWith the average gameplay and the lack of enemy variety, the gameplay gets stale very fast.\nExcept for a few areas, the level design is somewhat boring.\nThe difficulty can jump from stupidly easy to jesu cristi hard, especially on the hardest difficulty. This jump especially happens when you fight some bosses, then later fight MULTIPEL COPIES of the same boss at once.\n\nTHE MIDDLE GROUND\nThe game itself is supremely average. Its a Devil May Cry action game with heavier emphasis on gunplay. You defeat enemies with combos, dodge attacks with rolls and your teleport ability, build up combo meters and unleash special gunkata moves. The flow isn't supremely smooth, but passable.\nYou get cameos from various other characters in the universe, which is cool, but most of them are either a) low tier crappy characters OR b) last about 10 minutes (like Wolverine)\n\nTHE HEAVENS\nDeadpool. Deadpool. Deadpool. He makes this game from a mediocre 5/10 supremely average action game to something quite fun and memorable to me. If you like Daniel Way's version of Deadpool, as this draws heavily from the 'randomly insane nutball' Deadpool more than the 'methodically insane guy hiding a broken man' Deadpool (for the record : I love both), then you'll love this version of Deadpool's character. His humor and insanity is spot on, his arguements with his own inner voices hilarious. HIs banter as he fights, which I was worried was going to get stale fast, is fairly numerous and changes as the game goes on.\nThe unlock system rewards what limited exploring you can do in the levels, but most of your points will be from racking up high combos without getting hit, using your teleport to move from enemy to enemy smoothly. You can unlock new guns, melee weapons, and upgrade them and your own skills in various ways.\n\nFINAL VERDICT\nDeadpool is the saving grace in this ho hum game. While the gameplay itself isn't bad, it also isn't that good. If you are a huge Deadpool fan, get this. If  you are only a so so Deadpool fan, I suggest waiting for it to go on sale.\n\n7/10","July 16, 2013","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

High Moon Studios didn't lie at all, because there is a lot of Deadpool, a lot of bangs, a lot of babes(if you like dead babes they are there as well) and god damnit it's full of mayhem!!!\n\nIt is a great game, probably one of the best games I've ever played.

On easy difficulty all you need is just randomly hit X and Y, but on ultra-violence diff. this trick won't work, you need to combine steel-arms with long-range weapons, use "guntacks" and "momentum" moves which are very funny and has perfect animation as well as Deadpool, also nice thing is in an upgrade system, for example at the beginning of the game your shotgun has 4 shells in cage and it feels like normal shotgun, but when you fully upgrade it your shotgun will become some sort of machine-gun with 20 shells in one cage, and believe me the game will not become easier even if you buy all the upgrades.\n\nOne of the worst thing in game is the AI, it's really, really dumb, and sometimes the game feels like challenge mode, because enemies are keep coming over and over again, and you dying over and over which make you angry, btw the game is really hard, maybe it's a bit unbalanced, but I did enjoyed it a lot and even beat all the challenge maps. And the last disappointing thing is the lack of collectibles, but it could be compensate if you an achievement hunter(unlike me), but keep in mind that it's very hard to get them all.\n\nAnd the last thing, it's Deadpool after all, which means there is tons of humor and fourth wall breaking.\n\n7.5 chimichangas out of 10\nSayonara ♥♥♥♥♥♥es!!!","July 17, 2015","true","35.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I got pumped for the movie with the release of the trailer for the new Deadpool movie, so I decided to play this game for the first time. Works well with 5760x1080 (required me to patch it using Flawless Wide screen.) But sadly this game does have some down sides. The villains are, as Deadpool himself says at one point D-list, and his fear of clowns is never really explored. The setting is cool, the story is hilarious and the dialogue is witty and downright funny sometimes. Gameplay wise.... It's a basic beat 'em up with some guns and "coins" sprinkled through the world, nothing earth shattering but fun enough to stay fresh through the whole play through.\n\nI'd recommend it to a friend who's into comics and looking for maybe 2 days worth of fun from a game.

Really fun, Great comments, amusing scenes, great voice-actors and nice graphic.\nIt's great in entertainment and is through and through fun. (Yay! *clapping hands of joy*)\n\nBUT! dom dom dooom!\nIf you are that kind of person (like myself) who likes a challenging game,  a long(er) story, and a nice key layout, then this game is *not* for you! This game is not challenging at all, it does not provide a story-line which tells you anything about anything (though it does have these short little comic clips that tells a bit about certain characters), and the game is more or less over before you know it. It all in all seems more like a cut-out chapter of a full game than an actual full game. You can probably finish this game in about 2-3 hours (or maybe less) the first time you play through. -- Which, in my opinion, is pretty bad, especially because the game is so fun and entertaining. The game has only a few short chapters and it seems like there could've been so much more. As for the keyboard layout -- it's just about as silly and senseless as the character you control. Using mouse as most games, and the w,a,s,d for movement is fine, but then there's the other buttons that just seems like the developers dropped a handful of random letters and said "those shall be the keys of which thou shall press to do stupid things!" Of couse you can change the keys in the settings but you are limited to the in-game existing keys, which means that you can only switch out what some of the keys do. *sigh* "purdy damn annoying".\n\nSO big question is: Should you play this game?\nYES! cause its fun and if you're strange, then you won't feel strange compared to your character\nThe second BIG question: Is it worth the money?\n... nyeah -- I'd say nope to that. If this game cost about 14$/13€, sure it would be worth it.\nSo unless you have more money than you care for, wait till it gets on sale.\n\nSo the conclusion is?\nIf you like silly fun stuff and like to chop people to pieces and say senseless things while doing so, then YES! You should definitely get this game! -- But wait till it gets cheaper or comes on sale or you might be disappointed.\nBut when it does, be sure to get it and have fun! :D\n\nI'd like to give this game a thumbs up cause of the "fun factor" but also a thumbs down due to the lack of story and playtime.

As a spectacle fighter, the game mechanics are very simple & average, a lot of the levels are boring & visually unimpressive, there's really nothing special going on here.\n\nHowever, if you are a fan of Deadpool, even a casual one, you'll have a blast with this game. The comedy is absolutely spot on & they nailed the character portrayal perfectly. What I love about this is everything is actually directed by & seen through Deadpool's eyes. Usually when I see Deadpool depicted in other forms of media apart from comics, he shows up & acts nuts, simply just being there to add a little comedy to the game.  But in this everything in the game is 100% Deadpool, tons of obsessing over boobs, ♥♥♥♥ jokes, comedic yet ultra violent kills & tons more that all comes out of left field.\n\nMy absolute favourite part of Deadpool is that its a video game. Yeah that sentence does not make a lot of sense but let me elaborate. The whole plot of the game is Deadpool wanting High Moon studios to make a video game starring him, he realizes he's in a game & frequently speaks with the head of High Moon studios, complaining about the level he's in so that it can be changed immediately. Deadpool riffs on game design, QA testing, artists, other games & even has a phone call with Nolan North. If you are involved in the game industry you will have an appreciation of this game & its jokes that others may not.\n\nI don't want to give more than that away but as I've already stated it's simple: Deadpool as a game is average, but for fans it's a must play. It's full of amazing references to more than just Marvel comics, its hilarious, & you will most definitely have a fun time. It's upsetting to me that this game did not sell as well as Activision wanted, which made them decide to put High Moon on Call Of Duty work, as a big fan of three of their games now this may be the last title that is truly from them.","August 17, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

High Moon Studios didn't lie at all, because there is a lot of Deadpool, a lot of bangs, a lot of babes(if you like dead babes they are there as well) and god damnit it's full of mayhem!!!\n\nIt is a great game, probably one of the best games I've ever played. The combat is good and innovative, because it's really nice idea to crossbreed TPS(third person shooter) and hack n slash mechanics, of course it's not hardcore TPS, because Deadpool can simply lock on targets, but it plays great. On easy difficulty all you need is just randomly hit X and Y, but on ultra-violence diff. this trick won't work, you need to combine steel-arms with long-range weapons, use "guntacks" and "momentum" moves which are very funny and has perfect animation as well as Deadpool, also nice thing is in an upgrade system, for example at the beginning of the game your shotgun has 4 shells in cage and it feels like normal shotgun, but when you fully upgrade it your shotgun will become some sort of machine-gun with 20 shells in one cage, and believe me the game will not become easier even if you buy all the upgrades.\n\nOne of the worst thing in game is the AI, it's really, really dumb, and sometimes the game feels like challenge mode, because enemies are keep coming over and over again, and you dying over and over which make you angry, btw the game is really hard, maybe it's a bit unbalanced, but I did enjoyed it a lot and even beat all the challenge maps. And the last disappointing thing is the lack of collectibles, but it could be compensate if you an achievement hunter(unlike me), but keep in mind that it's very hard to get them all.\n\nAnd the last thing, it's Deadpool after all, which means there is tons of humor and fourth wall breaking.\n\n7.5 chimichangas out of 10\nSayonara ♥♥♥♥♥♥es!!!","July 17, 2015","true","35.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wouldn't pay more than $9.99/£7.99 for this!\n\nThis is a pretty awesome game, and if you are remotely familiar with Deadpool from the comics then you will like this game. There is a ton of 4th wall breaks and you get to really see Deadpool's crazy side, especially because you always have the voices in his head talking to you. There is a lot of humor involved in the game too, and it is very much so an 18's and over game as there is frequent sexual referencies and jokes made.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are pretty easy to work out too as it is pretty much just a basic hack and slash game. There are a number of weapons that you can purchase and upgrade, though personally I couldn't really see much benefit to changing from the samurai swords when it came to melee weapons. I played the game on normal, and purchased all weapons but whereas the guns did seem to have clear uses against certain enemies, the melee weapons just seemed a bit meh to me. The twin Sai (japanese daggers) seemed to have much less damage than the swords, with only a little speed boost and the Twin Hammers had a little damage boost but a severe speed loss. Even with upgrades the sai and hammers just didn't seem worth it to me so I just played the majoriity of the game using the samurai swords that you start the game with. As far as guns go, you start with twin pistols, then can upgrade to shotguns, uzi's and laser pistols. I did switch through guns regularly as I found that certain guns seemed more effective against certain enemies, and if you are cornered by a large group you might need to sacrifice power in aid of continual attack.\n\nI was a little confused about the difficulty of the game, as I played on it's normal (default) setting and the majority of the game seemed to be very easy. That didn't stop me from dying, as the camera isn't the best and I did find myself getting stuck on walls as I was fighting which would sometimes result in a premature death. Another cause for death was health regeneration sometimes not working. This wasn't an everyday occurance, and it was something I did keep my eye on as Deadpools health will only regenerate if you are not being attacked. For me though, there were times when I was definitely not being attacked and my health simply wouldn't regenerate. After dying though, it would work fine. As far as the difficulty goes too, most of the game is very linear and very easy to complete up until the end and then suddenly the end game fights are very full on and can be very tough as you are bombarded with enemies in a number of waves, and if you die before you have reaches a cut scene then you have to restart the whole section again. This did get very annoying for me at one point as it spawned wave after wave of enemies and it gives no respite between the waves and so you might need some time to recover ammo or health and you simply don't have it. It became more about luck as to where the ammo dropped (and what ammo dropped) than skill as to staying alive.\n\nA few spoilers in this paragraph so only read if you don't mind them, if you do then skip to the next paragraph - I was pretty dissapointed by the boss fights if I am honest. Up until the end of the game, it does very good to keep the game fresh by throwing new modes or scenery at you (no spoilers here but the parts with death are pretty funny and enjoyable) and then suddenly at the end you have to fight Marauders for a second time (each one is a sub boss earlier in the game) but all together. This is another annoying part of the game as at times one enemy will hit you and whilst you are standing up, another will hit you back down. If the timing is just right, you can be hit constantly until dead without ever letting you stand back up (which is very frustrating) and then when you finally beat the marauders you then have to fight and kill multiple waves of Mister Sinister's clones. Again the bombardment doesn't offer real challenge, it just offers stress. You find yourself ghammering at buttons as opposed to enjoying the game play because there literally isn't a moment to catch your breath at this point. When you finally get through the three or four waves of clones, the game just ends rather abruptly which is a real dissapointment. In all honesty the whole end game fight just felt very lazy with the constant spawning of trash mobs and no real story progression. You literally spend 30-40 minutes fighting about 20 waves of different enemies and bosses in the same place. It really didn't feel like the ending that this game deserved.\n\nAll in all this game is good enough for me to recommend, however I would not pay the listed price at all and personally I would not recommend that anyone pays more than £7.99/$9.99 for this title as it feels pretty rushed and unless you die a lot you are only really likely to get about 3-5 hours (maximum) of game time. This game is enjoyable and the story is nonsensical and bizarre in such a way that it just works. The elements of comedy that are littered throughout the game are brilliant too and did make me literally laugh out loud as I was playing. The end of the game does leave dissapointment though and I do wonder if the studio simply ran out of money (as Deadpool is continually told throughout). This game does have replay value, but when it offers so little actual game time it is in no way worth the £29.99 that they currently are asking.","April 2","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's ridculous, its funny, well, it's Deadpool.\n\nThe story is pretty much your average cliche "superhero beats villian and the world is now saved yay" but the reason why this 100% cliche story still makes this game great is because of Deadpool, who of course breaks about 4 walls, maybe like 100 walls, throughout the entire game. All the jokes are all the reasons why you should buy this game. He even makes fun of the whole ordeal against the "bad guy" who is conveniently named Sinister. There are couple of other Marvel charactes like the Xmen who are in the game throughout the story for Marvel fans who are interested.\n\nWell the gameplay is fun and fast, you shoot some people get some coins and then go upgrade your weapons or get new ones, it's a little repetitive like all beat 'em up games but the gameplay isn't very complicated.\n\nCut scenes are great as well as the animation. Everything is also styled like the Deadpool comic series so it gives that fun and lighthearted comic book feel. Voices are perfect and makes the game so much more enjoyable.\n\nI suppose the only negative thing I have to say is the price tag of the game. I bought it at 50% off, which makes it "I'll cry a bit internally but I'll still buy it" price level. Don't buy at the original price, not for a game that doesn't take that long to complete (I finished in about 9 hours) It is a great game and I recommend it, but at $39.99? mmmm maybe no.\n\nIt's a well made game and anyone can play it, Deadpool fan or not. You might be like me, someone who didn't really know who Deadpool was until the movie came out, which is the reason why I bought this game, or you could be someone who has Deadpool posters all over his/her wall, either way, you will definitely like this game. :)","March 14","true","8.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you like his humour/style, this game plays as though he writes the script (ok, 'they' write it, he ignores them. Enter: Deadpool, stage left! Banana!) The game play is button mashing combos to beat up on groups of enemies, similar to the Batman:Arkam City idea, with less combos, etc. You can unlock more special combos for your weapons as the game progresses. There are various minigames built in, and a Funhouse, all help vary the game up, and the story is actually follow-able, considering it is scripted by Deadpool.\n\nIt's been a while since I played it, but I remember enjoying it, and everyone who saw it wanted to play, too - with about 10h of playtime on it. I got it@ about half price, and am really happy with my purchase. Then again, I spent about $700 on Counterstrike so far, too.\n\nI especially enjoy the sneaky/gank/smash the guy in the back of the head with a hammer animations. Some of those are BRUTAL. I only wish there had been a few more opportunites to actually use this ability.\n\n*Gameplay feels like it was designed for a controller, but mouse/kb is survivable.\n*Story is there and entertaining enough to keep you going for the length of the campaign. It was not quite as cool as I would like DPool to have been. Deadpool is meant to be insane+cool. I kinda got quirky instead.\n*Mechanics felt solid, and I didn't pick up on any real bugs anywhere in the game.\n*Difficulty: I put it on easy, so I could unlock the story. Badguys at the end felt like it got ramped WAY up. Lots of running away to heal involved.\n\n","November 26, 2013","true","11.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Think of it like noticable flawed DMC fight style.

Deadpool is a really funny game and the game is basically about a scripted video game that Deadpool decides not to read and he rips the script up, so you basically dont know what happenes until it happenes obviously. Deadpool has alot of funny one liners and he has a special healing ability that I am pretty sure all Deadpool fans know about and you can upgrade all his weapons and of course himself. Nolan North voices Deadpool in the game and is fantastic but like I said I dont know what Deadpool normally sounds like.\n\nThe game Itself runs very well and is capped at 60FPS!, I was using DSR from 4K to 1080P with all the settings maxed out and the game runs extremely well, even the controls are actually quite good but you can adjust them if you want to.\n\nOverall I enjoyed Deadpool, It is very funny at times, has easy achievements and the game runs like a boss, the combat can be repetitive at times but Deadpool's conversations during thoses time just make it feel new and fresh again. I would recommend this game to anyone even if you haven't gotten into Deadpool because thanks to this game I am interested in the Deadpool Universe now.","January 31","true","43.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

When it first came out years ago, I had no idea who the hell Deadpool was. I really didn't. I just had seen his picture around the 'net a few times. Then I saw some gameplay. Then I realized he is AWESOME. So a friend gifted it to me long long ago. Nice to see it's back on Steam for others to play. Because of this game, I have been reading the comics, and I saw the movie, and I can't get enough of it! GO FORTH MY LITTLE SHEEPIES! GET SUCKED INTO A GOOD FRANCHISE, for once! *cough* notmylittlepony *cough*\nLegit, though. He's hilarious. Game itself, well, pretty generic, but the character design, environments, comedy and acting really make up for it. This game mocks itself the whole way through.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFallOfRTU/recommended/224060/","TheFallOfRTU","TrollWithNoName","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFallOfRTU/","52 products in account","This is a great Hack n' Slash game with awesome gun gameplay and solid gameplay accompanied by great combos and upgrades with mediocre to great bad guys.\nThe game still retains the insane, funny and 4th wall breaking deadpool with his homociadal and insane mind/personality. Also with all the jokes and narrating voice in his head.\nThis game lasted me 8.5 hours and I thought it were going to be a lot shorter but it was great game for the buck(especially if on sale) I would get it in a sale though because there is really no replay-ability once completed, though you do have challenges/arena battle thing. The story is very vague and was really explained or told as well deadpool being deadpool shut off when anything important happend but bearing in mind this is a game deadpool "made".\nOverall I do think this is a good game and would reccomend this to anyone interested in Marvel, superheros(though in Deadpool's case "anti-hero" though some X-men and other Marvel characters appear) or just want to have a go at a fun game\n\nThis game gets a rating of...\n\n8.5/10\n\nPros;\n1.Great solid hack. N' slash and gun gameplay.\n2.Great voice acting.\n3.Hilarious comical moments.\n4.Badass moves/combos, upgrades and weapons selection.\n5. Good enemy selection.\n6. Cable and X-Chumps are in this game!\n7. It's for "bang for buck" especially whilst it's on sale.\n\nCons:\n1.(courtesy of deadpool re-writing the games script and this being his game)\nThere is a lack of story and I didn't really know what the evil plan was of the main villain until the end(still was very vague though)\n2. Lack of replay-ability due to linear story(I like linear games btw so don't attack!) and no real reason to replay...\n3. Add more boss fights(i thought there could be moar.\n\n\n","February 14","true","8.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedrastikmeasure/recommended/224060/","thedrastikmeasure","Draul","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedrastikmeasure/","3257 products in account","Deadpool is a game that most people will tell you is repetitive and bland. That the comedy can only get you so far until you feel you want to bash your skull into a wall for hours for having spent the money to buy this game. Those people are almost most likely the same people who will rate Call of Duty at a 8  or higher.\n\nI was gifted a preorder copy of Deadpool. I love most .... All comic book based video games. Especially those based around Marvel and DC characters. I had high hopes for this game and I can tell you that I was not let down, at least not by the game itself. The amount of playtime I got out of the game on the other hand was upsetting.\n\nMost people who play this game stuck to 1 weapon the entire game. When in fact there are many other weapons. Weapons that change the style of play and effect combat in different ways. I changed weapons every so often as I went through the game so it kept the game fresh and I had no problems with the game feeling like it was outlasting its welcome.\n\nThe comedy in the game was fantastic and they really stuck with what makes Deadpool such a fantastic character. Anti-hero to the teeth. Slapstick, yet dark humor to the end. There are very few games or movies that have made me laugh nearly as hard as I did when playing Deadpool.\n\nThey even try to do something a little different so to add new level designs and mechanics throughout the game. Such as turning the game into a 2d sidescrolling platform game for a level.  The only thing I was upset with over the entire game was that there was no killer chimichange boss fight for Deadpool to fight and or devour.\n\nIf you like action adventure games, if you like Deadpool, this game is a must buy. The campaign only took me right at seven hours to complete and that was on easy. I did zero of the challenges and don't plan on doing them. I still wish the game had lasted longer. It is possible however that if the game were longer that it would have eventually worn out it's welcome, who knows.\n\nMy vote for this game? Yes, buy it! Play it! Love it!\n\nDeadpool gets a Drastik Measures - 8/10","June 26, 2013","true","10.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

If you love Deadpool, this game is for you.  If you dont, this game is STILL for you :D\n\nUltimately though this game leans on its comedy, it's a generic hack-and-slash game so dont expect major gameplay or long term replayability, but this game is still a whole bunch of fun, youll wait on every cutscene just to hear what else Deadpool has to say or do.\n\nStill, its a short and sweet game, i managed to complete it in 6 hours, playing casually and slowly so is it worth buying?\nNot at full price, BUT,  wait until it goes under $20, then snag this game because it definitely IS one you have to play once :)\n\nOverall scoring:\nSound quality: 8/10 - Superb voice acting, woulda been 10/10 but some of the cutscenes have this tube-effect which ruins the sound quality in some places of the game.\nGameplay: 6/10 - Fun, with progression and SO many weapons and gadgets. The last mission though is too difficult..highly advised that you play this game on easy. Many unfair imbalances on NPC's.\nComedy: 9/10 - Very funny, very original, i wish theyd stop making fun of nerds/computer players tho, its funny once but when the whole game keeps pushing "you have no life" jokes on you, it becomes unfunny. The rest of the comedy is gold.\nGraphics: 7/10 Xbox360/PS3 level graphics, high end. What you see looks fine and dandy. Too many sewer levels in my opinion.\nControls: 4/10 They work, but they keyboard bindings and controls are god awful! I STRONGLY recommend you use a Dual-Shock/360 controller. That said, i did manage to complete it with keyboard and mouse, so it can at least be worked with.","December 31, 2013","true","7.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Good for passing the time or if you need some interactive comedy in your life, but in terms of gameplay.... meeeh... kinda mediocre... predictable. Doesn't really invite anything new into the genre. But that's ok, because this game doesn't need to be cutting edge or stand-out in that department. This is a game about Deadpool, which means it's a game about goofing about whilst also being badass at the same time.\n\nHonestly, the jokes and fun factor rule the day with this game. And whilst some of the incidental lines get old pretty quick, the campaign dialogue is pure Deadpool goodness. There are moments that made me cringe or look away or just feel a bit blegh, but then I'm not really hugely into sexual and toilet humour. But most people are fine with that, so I say don't worry about it. If I enjoyed it despite that content, you'll probably enjoy it too.\n\nHonestly, my biggest gripe was that the game felt a bit short, but meh. I think it might be best buying it when it's on sale really, because the full price doesn't seem to fit the amount of actual game (though what there is is pretty action-packed and busy). Beyond that, yeah. I recommend go for it.","March 31","true","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Violent, funny and perverted just as you'd expect.  However, as cool as Deadpool is it doesn't excuse how bad the gameplay is.  The loading times are laughably bad between different scenes.  The combat whle pasable is prone to very bad fps loss for seemingly no reason.  I've played newer games which are much more graphically intensive without such bad drops in fps.  The only conclusion I can draw is its badly optimised.  I've had to reload from the same checkpoint several times just to try and move the game forward when it sticks.  I really wanted to like this and if the game didn't have so many issues such as the fps loss and just sticking at certain pooints and not moving forward I'd of given it a glowing review, but as it stands now I can't.","April 3","false","8.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SsGam3r/recommended/224060/","SsGam3r","CJ The Overlord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SsGam3r/","97 products in account","I managed to get this game RIGHT before launch day so I got the bonuses. I managed to complete it so it's time to give my review. Oh yeah minor spoiler warning.\n\nPlot:\nThe plot is really ♥♥♥♥ing simple. Deadpool is just living in his apartment when he gets a script. He doesn't follow the script and decides to kill some guy. Then after chasing him down after he escapes, Mr.Sinister kills the guy himself. Deadpool gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at him since he had a contract on him and then goes on a journey to kill Mr.Sinister. That's all you need to really know.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are eh. Because this was rushed out in 2 years, some things don't look too good. But it's a difference from the trailers. If I were to describe it simply, it would be like this. The graphics look like a glorified HD PS2 game from those HD collections you can get from the HD collections for PS3.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is a hack n' slash with third person shooter elements. It's a surprisingly good combo and does make for some fun gameplay. It also helps out in the long run in terms of tactics. But however there is a problem. The TPS elements are fine.It's the hack n' slash part that's wrong. Not to mention the camera as well.\nFor one thing, the combat is slow and clunky. Nothing like something you would see from Platinium Games. The combos are kinda hard to string together(unless you get the Sai melee weapon). Also, when I'm trying to slash one enemy, Deadpool will slash another person when I want to focus on the last enemy I was trying to kill. But yeah, the hack n' slash is okay, but its got its problems.\n\nControl:\nThe layout is kinda wonky, so you might wanna map different actions to other keys. But other than that, it controls alright.\n\nVerdict:\nIn my personal opinion, the gameplay should be vice versa. High Moon has never done a hack n' slash before(and it really shos). It would've been better if it was a TPS with hack n' slash elements.\n\nIf you are a Deadpool fan then it's a 8/10. It perfectly captures the personality of Deadpool and it will have you laughing. You might have a good time.\n\nIf not, then 7/10. It's good, but it's kinda lacking in some areas. Plus campaign is like 6-7 hours total if you want to explore, if you die, and if you get stuck. So I can't imagine how short it would be without all that.","June 25, 2013","true","11.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Wolverine and 2.5D fighting game Marvel Vs Capcom 3) the graphics of the game are great, controls are a bit stiff and the gameplay is good but the shooter element was ehh....meh, but more overall it's still a good Marvel licensed game and i recommend this game to the people who enjoys superhero video games and are huge fans of Deadpool\n\ni rate this game a 7.5 out of 10","December 14, 2015","true","23.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

On the one hand if you like immature, 4th wall breaking, perverted comedy I would say go for it however if you don't it's incredibly hard to recommend this game. As a fan of that kind of comedy, I must say wondering what piece of randomness the game is going to do next is what kept me going. If you're not a fan of the comedy there really isn't much that'll keep you going. The gameplay is just for the most part a beat em up in it's basic form. Granted there are guns, but thy're more there for keeping combos going. The game is roughly 7-ish hours long so it may sound short but given the content of the game itself it keeps bringing something fresh each level and last long enough to not get old fast. It's a tough choice but as someone that didn't mind going through the repetitive combat to get to the next joke I'd give it the thumbs up.","May 21","true","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sometimes you overpower your enemies too easily, sometimes you find yourself  so much outnumbered the only thing you can do is hope for the best. Even finding  where  to go can be quite a challenge.\nIt's a fun dip in the Marvel universe, I guess, and they weren't shy in making Deadpool do... Well, Deadpool stuff, I guess? He does have his mouth (bit of a shame sometimes his phrases repeat - quite randomly also) and his voices, the funny 4th wall breakings, and hilarious moments with the X-men. And, everything is loveably gorish.\nWhat I  did  appreciate a lot is the length of the game: any shorter would have been too messy, any longer too tiring.\nSo yeah, all in all I'd give the game a good 7.5/10.","January 15","true","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They poke fun at game logic, and I guess you coulld say this game is saterizing the action/platformer genre. "Laws of physics be damned", when refering to double jumps. I really find this game to be hilarous. And its not BAD in anyway. Just very plain for gameplay.

Boss fights are poorly done (the end boss merely being another 'kill waves of respawning, look-alike goons), and generally, it just isn't worth the time.

In the beginning the fact that it was campy as hell was fairly obvious, but I can deal with that.  Then it began to fall apart fairly rapidly.  You don't have a teleport, although it says you do, because it only works where they say it will work.  It's full to the eyeballs with stupid jumping puzzles of the normal stupid jumping puzzle variety.  It actually has side-scroller sub-games in it.  I suppose some numbskull thought that would be 'retro'.  It doesn't allow you to assign weapons to hotkeys, so forget about fast weapon swapping.  Not happening.  Toggle through the cycle of weapons while in combat, patiently watching your status indicator until it gets to the one you want.  The keyboard mappings it does allow are at best ridiculous.  No save game.  Anywhere.  Checkpoint city.  So it was written by those so-called 'game programmers' who somehow don't know what a disk drive is, or that every console that's come out in the past fifteen years has one.  Because there is no save-game, if you don't successfully complete one of the (very long) stupid jumping puzzles in one pass, you get to start again from the beginning, or even earlier depending on where the last checkpoint was.  It couldn't possibly be more linear if it was drawn with a laser beam.  There are no alternate completions - anywhere.  You do what you're supposed to do in the order and manner in which the designers deemed you must do it, or you don't do it at all.\n\nAfter that it gets worse.  Believe it or not.  It crashes.  I mean to desktop.  Sometimes, though, it will attempt to restart itself.  So A) they haven't got a single programmer on staff or it would at least be able to catch itself crashing and log a reason, and B) they don't realize that if the game crashes cleanly to desktop, anything you do to try to fix that is an error.  And when it crashes to desktop, it somehow contrives to take the OPERATING SYSTEM DRIVERS WITH IT.  Yeah, that means you get to reboot your computer.  I'm talking a Windows 7 computer with eight processors.  I have to reboot it.  I haven't seen a program do that in years, and I'm a developer myself.  Windows 7 is pretty good about isolating processes. I didn't think it was even theoretically possible to gut the operating system like that with a program.  So they haven't got a real programmer on staff, and what amateur schmucks they do have on staff thought it would be cool to dig into the guts of the operating system to cobble this monstrosity together.  You don't want anybody digging around in your OS, but if it's necessary, it's best if it's somebody with a vague clue what the hell they're doing!\n\nI imagine there are a few things that are passable.  The combat isn't as bad as it could be, but that isn't saying much.  All in all, I give this about a 1.5 on a scale of 10.  I have about three games that I've never completed even once because they're just that pathetically bad.  This will make four.  If you do plan on buying it, you should be no older than twelve years.  If you're that young, you might be dumb enough to find the game entertaining and the so-called humor anything but infantile.","September 20, 2015","false","50.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

There is no real clarity on when to attack the large enemies and when you have to keep track of more than one large enemy while you are getting shot at or something of the sorts, good luck.

High Moon studios did a fantastic job capturing the feel and nature of the character. Combining Nolan North's phenomenal voice work, Daniel Way's excellent writing, and High Moon's obsessive attention to detail, this is easily the most fully realized Deadpool I've yet to see in games.\n\nHowever, the game itself is just not fun. After 2 hours, the jokes and situational humor can no longer conceal what is essentially a barebones, hack-n-slash. The combat is a grueling chore, and aside from a few pseudo-puzzles and mounted chain gun sequences, combat will take up the entirety of the game. Wave after wave, area after area, you’ll be hacking through generic, identical soldiers for no clear reason.\n\nMr. Sinister is making an army of clones, and stealing their souls… or something like that. Neither you, nor Deadpool is inclined to care, and to be honest, in a Deadpool game, I’m willing to let that pass. It’s in the nature of the character. However, considering how abruptly the game comes to its anti-climactic end, you’ll wonder if any of the time you spent was worth it.\n\nIn my opinion, it was only partly worth it. Seeing Deadpool realized in such a way made me happy. I just wish the experience was more enjoyable.\n","January 14","false","7.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Okay there are some, but they're so easy that you can't really consider them puzzles, especially when the game explains them to an extreme extent.\n• No actual strategies: Normal enemies = The small guns are enough | Bigger enemies = Pull out the shotguns or go home | A group of enemies with a lot of health = Combo time\n• Silly below-the-belt jokes and bad puns.

If Steam refund policies weren't so strict, I would have asked for a refund for this game a long time ago. I do not think that it is worth it even with a 75% off discount. This game should only be bought if below $3.\n\nThe gameplay is very dull. It tries to mimic Rocksteady's Batman combat, but fails to do so and turns out to be a very boring and not fluid two button smasher with some combos that does almost the same thing. The shooting mechanics are just as boring, and they are below average compared to other games. There are some powers that you can acquire eg: teleportation but they are poorly executed and they seem forced.\n\nThe story is a long fetch quest with you running around the various maps trying to find various objects. Many of them just seem to be IMO unnecessary missions that tries to delay a short story. The jokes are generally not funny and forgettable, the only ones that were good were in the first 5 minutes. The story is very linear with no other paths. The plot as a whole is very predictable. Basically an evil villain did some ♥♥♥♥ and you have to find him.\n\nEven if you are a fan of Deadpool or Marvel, you should avoid this cluster♥♥♥♥ of a game or wait for a HUGE discount before buying. I did not complete this game because I got sick and tired of those long and boring fetch quests that they kept throwing at me.\n\nI would give this game a 3/10","December 13, 2013","false","3.8"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","4","12","0","0"

Initially, I did enjoy it because it felt familiar, and I just couldn't figure out why. Then I realized that this game has the same mechanics as Spider-Man the game did, but that was released in 2002.\n\nThat game I loved, but when you take away the open world and the ability to swing around it severely hampers the game. What made matters worse, though, was the audio. The soundtrack and the effects were fine, but Deadpool narrates the entire game. And he does so with two voices, neither of which ever add anything to the game. I understand it's supposed to be campy because it's based off a comic book, but it’s not 1994 anymore so all the references are brutal.\n\nI finally came to the conclusion that I do not fit the target demographic for this game. First, you need to have the mental capacity which is less than that of a 10 year old, which I don't (and I can prove it. I drive a car and everything.) And secondly, I don't wear anything with dragons on it.\n\nIf you have a lot of clothing with dragon's on them this game will be perfect for you because you'll find the jokes hilarious and won't mind the lack of story, or half-♥♥♥♥♥ and repetitive gameplay.\n\nIf you do want to get this game, then you should probably uninstall your sound card drivers before you start, just in case. I really can't stress how never ending the puns are.\n\n6/10 with the game on mute.\n3/10 with the sound on.","December 31, 2013","false","3.0"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","0"

Not the Dirty Harry Movie ;~;\n\n\n\n\nDeadpool is a game that got released a few months ago. I bought it over the summer sale, and just recently got around to playing it. Its produced by Activision, and made by High-Moon. Its a small game, 6 GB. and has went on sale once in the 6 months since its launch. Its a hack-and-slash shooter that stars the funniest comic book character in all of existence. You run around and kill stuff, you know the drill.\n\nNow most people love Deadpool, or at-least know OF him. Me on the other hand, I didn't know that he existed until around the time the game came out. This may be due in part to the fact that the only 4 games that I grew up playing where Mortal Kombat, Mercenaries, Halo, and CoD, but that's another story.Moving on, if your like me, and you don't know who in the f*ck Deadpool is, i'll fill you in. Deadpool is part of Marvels long list of characters, who like Wolverine, can't die. Hes a Merc, kills people, was born in Canada. and has the mind of a 12 year old boy who just discovered the Human Body(Keep this in mind for the rest of the review, its kinda important). Oh, and he blows and breaks the 4th wall(The wall that keeps  characters from knowing that there in a game, comic, movie, ect).And last, his name is Wade Wilson if you care.\n\nNow most of Deadpools story revolves around him breaking the 4th Wall. The first 20 mins or so, you go around, looking at Deadpools stuff, and getting a quick description of the item, by Deadpool. After that, ge goes, blows up High-Moon for not liking his script, or something like that, and goes about destroying Mr.Sinister. The plot is pretty strait forward. Go, kill people, save the Earth, Kill Mr.S, laugh at bad jokes, role Credits. There's no real plot twist, or if there was one, I just didn't notice. There's some interesting moments when you meet up with Vertigo, Wolverine, and a few other hot Marvel chics, but outside of that, the story is strait forward, and for the most part, forgettable.\n\nNow although the story sucks, the writing is AMAZING. Or laughable. Now as I said a few paragraphs back, Deadpool has a mind of a 12 year old. All the writing revolves around Boobs, ♥♥♥♥, and Death. Nothing more, nothing less. Ok, now maybe i'm one sided, as i'm 14, but the lack of seriousness is just great. I mean, when was the last time that you had a Party, in your imagination, that had non-stop super models? Thats right... A lot, but still... Deadpool spits out quips like they where going out of style, but for the most part, there laughable enough to keep the story going. There's plenty of times when you go about doing idle actions, like taking a ♥♥♥♥ or slapping Wolverine, and all the while, DP is spitting out more quips, but this time a bit funnier than normal. Overall, the writing for DP is amazing, and for the most it helps ease the tedium of gameplay.\n\n\n\nOn the topic of gameplay, lets type about that. As I already stated, the gameplay revolves around swords, guns, and frags. The gunplay is about at a JC2 level, or rather, it sucks. Only 2 or 4 of the guns do any damage, and the thing is that those are the guns that you never get ammo for. So for the most part, having a gun is used for boss battles, not much more. The grenades can be summarized as being useless. I don't recall using them more than 2 or so times in the 8 hours of gameplay. Sad. The slashing fairs a bit better. There is a counter key, a key for heavy attacks and a key for light attacks. For the most part, I found myself spamming the light attack key, and every one in a while tapping the heavy attack just for variety. Now along with the gameplay are some weird puzzles, platform segments, and boss battles. But for the most part, those segments are easy and quick. It may take one or 2 retrys, but then there done. No pain.\n\nLastly, the graphics and sound. The graphics for DP are meh. They  take a comic esc, not quite cell shaded approach. For the most part it works out decently. There isn't much more to be said. Regrading the sound, it fairs a bit worse. Or rather, average. The guns go boom. The music goes La-La-La. The voice actors go  "I'm NN here to get this over with, pay me". Nothing stand out. Nothing more to be said. Its Meh.\n\nOk. Das Verdict. Is it worth it? To this I reply "Not for $50, Maybe for $15-$20" Everything but the writing is Meh. Nothing stand out. Meh\n\n\nGraphics-4\nSound-5\nGameplay-5\nStory-3\nEnv't-4\nFun Factor-9\nX-Factor-10(For dat writing)\n\nAverage-6.6 Almost Good\n","December 7, 2013","true","3.2"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

It looks really great, and the humor is good too, however there are some parts of this game (Specifically some mechanics) that are simply broken and ruin the whole experience.  These issues are always prevalent but stand out more noticably near the end of the game.  For example  *SPOILERS* When you are on your way to Magneto's Citadel, there is alot of platforming that simply doesnt work half the time, with platforms being barely in reach of a double jump AND teleport, not to mention the fact that the platforms fluctuate, making you wait senslessly for the right alignment. Another broken mechanic is the (Once again *SPOILER*) upgraded teleport mechanic.  It boasts the ability to tansport you over long distances and says it will allow you to teleport between ledges, but the ability only works on a small number of pre-determined ledges that there is no other way to get to. The final issue I have with the gameplay is that when you die in certain sections, the enemies in the upcoming area respawn, but your ammo does not often making it a challenge to pass through a more challenging area.  A decent game that is very repetitive and could have been much more well polished before release","December 31, 2013","false","5.2"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","1","8","0","1"

The humour is spot on. It's just such a shame that the gameplay itself is ♥♥♥♥♥. The freeflow combat system that I guess was meant to emulate the grace of the Batman games is ruined by having way too many keys to make anything than basic attacking feasible. The most basic bad guys have so much health that the combat isn't fun at all, it's drudgery and sadly makes up 90% of the game. The majority of enemies can't be killed with melee weaps which means relying on guns that all have finite ammo. Most fights turn into camping one spot waiting for the ammo pickup to respawn. Oh and the guys who fly? Lockon by holding x, then left mouse to shoot... but if you MOVE the mouse, the lockon breaks. O_O Which ♥♥♥♥♥♥ designed that? So yeah, lockon is impossible which means they take forever to kill. FOREVER. The only thing that keeps me pressing through the boredom is the comedy script. Sigh.

Furthermore, the game doesn't appear to accept any gamepads other than XBOX 360 controllers, so this is a double-whammy in my wanting to play it.  Don't get me wrong, I expect I would love this game if I could play it with my normal controls or Logitech RumblePad 2, but I am currently boycotting the purchase of any DLC put out for the game until they get proper key re-assignments fixed.","November 28, 2013","false","1.6"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","2","12","0","0"

"Hello, I'm Carly." "And I'm Sam," Sam jumped in."And we're live on iCarly," Carly said cheerfully. "You might have noticed that we're not in our studio today.""That's right," Sam added as she pointed to the washbasin in the room. "Freddy needed a bath you see, and we've been busy scrubbing all the crud off him.""No, that's not it," Carly jumped in with a giggle. "You see, we found this stray dog today and I decided that I was going to keep him. But first we had to clean him up a bit. Show the people, Freddy."Freddy set the camera on the countertop and hit his remote and the wash footage started playing back. But because he had no time to edit the footage, everything was included. As he kept viewing the playback in case of problems he noticed something that got him a bit horny, but he couldn't put a finger on it just yet.He then checked the hit counter on the monitor and noticed that the numbers kept climbing higher and higher. In fact, they had already doubled their highest rated show to date. "Guys, check it out," he told the two girls. "Our hits are almost at 600,000."  "No way!" Sam said.  "Really," Carly said excitedly. "How come?" "I'm not sure," Freddy said as he hit a few buttons on his control.  Suddenly his eyes grew wide.  "Uh, Carly, you're... you're showing," he mumbled, covering his eyes with his hand. "Showing? Showing what?" Carly was confused by his statement. "Showing," he repeated, waving his hand towards the monitor, trying to point blindly at the screen with a blind eye. "You know... showing." Carly and Sam looked closer at the monitor. Suddenly Carly's eyes grew wide in shock and embarrassment. In her wet T-shirt, her dark aureoles were clearly visible and her aroused nipples were poking provocatively against the now clingy and sheer fabric. She glanced nervously from the monitor, to Samantha, to Freddy, who was still trying to be gentlemanly by holding his hand over his eyes, then back to Sam and down her own suggestively exposed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. "A-I-I-I-E-E-E-E-E!" She squealed in embarrassment as she cupped her ♥♥♥♥ with her hands and rushed up the stairs to her bedroom to put something to cover herself. While she was away, the tape kept playing on, Freddy being too flustered to even think of switching off the playback. Freddy couldn't stop himself from peeking from time to time through his fingers to get another glimpse of his dream girlfriend, Carly Shay. He could never have imagined that he would have ever gotten the opportunity to get to see her in such an exposed state, and he couldn't let it slip by. The tape kept playing on and when it got to the incident of Carly touching the dog's sheath the show's ratings took another major leap. By the time Carly returned the hits had nearly doubled again. "Carly, you won't believe this," Sam was saying excitedly. "We got over a million hits." "One point one million to be more precise," Freddy corrected, as he glanced at the monitor to confirm Sam's statement. "No way," Carly said, still not realizing the correlation of her appearance, or her actions with the dog to the ratings.  "Yes, way," Sam said excitedly. "We're in the big times, baby!" The three teenagers were too naïve to understand how much effect a near naked teenaged girl would have on the Internet, both for teen guys and predators. Much less a teenaged girl touching a dog's prick.","December 31, 2015","false","33.9"," 1 of 13 people (8%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","8","1","13","4","0"

Theres better games that have half or a third of the things I mentioned.  However High Moon Studios does all six and does a better than average and a slightly less than fantastic game.  I haven't read any Deadpool comics but I understand the appeal.  There's buggy camera controls so you would have to do most of the work using the mouse.  The only major character redesign was Death, Deadpools love interest.  Probably because it would have been a pain to animate a skull head woman.  Possibly they thought the Día de Muertos design looked better?\n\nAnyway if you live and breathe Deadpool, this is a must have.

There is a character progression (though basic) and it carries over on different playthrough.\n\nInto the mix is thrown so many easter eggs, crazy DP humor and entertainement (at least for the first couple playthrough).

The long awaited game by many deadpool fans, such a loved character that some DC Fans even enjoy his game more than other DC Games. Great game with an epic title and amazingly well done comic style texture. Arsenal of weapons ranging from simple swords to sais, heck to even HAMMERS. Guns we're also thrown in, you get dual pistols, shotguns, smg's and believe or not DUAL Pulse rifles! (which will help defeat most mini bosses) All these weapons come with amazing upgrades through the use of DP Points. (Deadpool Points) These are gained by finding secret ones in hidden chests-usually contain larger amount of DP- or stringing combos. A very random game and very stupendous gameplay, the combo mechanic is not too complex and also the game doesn't require a high end PC, which is a bonus for those who can't afford it. The game may get whacky so a sense of humor is required to play this game. 9 Pink Staplers/ 10 blue pencils. RECOMMENDED! And at 30 bucks, a great game bargain with over 10 hours of story line/ campaign and bonus Challenge maps with different difficulties which allowes some competitiveness with friends on those leaderboard. (ok you know what screw the recommendation, stop reading and go buy the game you idiot) P.S. Why are you still reading?

Leveling up Deadpools weapons, abilities and special moves helps keep things interesting as you progress through the story.

The over the top antics are what makes Deadpool such a loved character and High Moon Studios took that to heart.  Many times I found myself having to pause because I couldn't stop laughing.

The humour in this game is hilerious, i have never played a game where i have hit the escape key in the middle of a tough spot just to crack up. In terms of gameplay and controls, everything is pretty tight, i did have more fun playing with a contoler though. The grraphics are decent, and the writing is awesome.

Truth be told I expected major disappointment but I have to say, High Moon Studios did an amazing job in capturing Deadpool's character. If you're a fan I'd recommend the game, if not then you don't have much to look for here. The gameplay does enough to keep you going, with an average progression system and multiple weapons (4 melee, 4 ranged and I believe 4 throwables (grenades, mines, etc)) to purchase access to with the points you've earned through murdering anything with an opinion. You also have access to some 'Super-moves'. I found it all rather gimmicky, I loved unlocking the weapons and such for the sake of using them, but I ended up using the duel Katana's throughout. The hack and slash aspect is enough to pass the time when trying to progress through to the next dialogue/story sequence, but is hardly innovative, not something a gamer would go out of his way to experience. Also, I know Deadpool looks like a ninja, but don't expect a focus on stealth sequences, they are few and entertaining for parody's sake.\n\nAt the end of the day, you're playing this for Deadpool. The dialogue will keep you entertained and there is enough of it spread out throughout the game to keep you well satisfied, or at least it did for me. That this game chose to include little minigame segments that aren't really there to punish or reward the player, but show off just how insane Wade is a fantastic choice in my opinion. The addition of other big marvel players (Cable, Wolverine, Domino, etc) is minor to the story but still, it's what you expect to see in the Marvel Universe and frankly between Cable's theme song and getting to B***h slap Logan, I'm sure no one would complain.\n\nTLDR; Gameplay is average. Deadpool is amazing. Play this for Deadpool.","December 29, 2013","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is more due to the fact that it's somewhat average core mechanics are propped up with some entertaining and memorable setpieces along with some fairly strong writing in terms of comedy.\n\nIt's undeniably a bit of a masculine power fantasy game so your millage will certainly vary if you're looking for balanced and reasonable characters.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elfshotthefood/recommended/224060/","elfshotthefood","ElfShotTheFood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elfshotthefood/","1709 products in account","Deadpool is a mediocre licensed comic book game. It has simplistic combat, dull graphics, and uninspired level designs. The game is also far too easy, right up to the point where the developers realized they only had about five hours of gameplay, at which point it becomes far too hard.\n\nDeadpool has one saving grace, and it might be just enough for some people: it's funny, thanks in large part to great voice-acting and some amusing pokes at videogame design. Not all of the jokes work - and if you're not a fan of toilet humor and rampant sexism, move on - but there are so many gags being thrown at the player that some will induce genuine laughter.\n\nThis is a game where you'll carve your way through waves of identikit enemies just to hear the next funny thing Deadpool says, or to watch the amusing cutscenes where Deadpool interacts with other Marvel characters and the designers of his own game. Deadpool even has a telephone conversation with the voice actor who does his voice. Deadpool will often comment on things you do too, like calling you a "noob" for firing a shotgun at an enemy that is well out of range.\n\nIt's the stuff in between the jokes and cutscenes where Deadpool has problems; you know, the actual gameplay. Deadpool is a basic hack and slash action title where you string simple combos together and throw in some gunplay for good measure. It works...some of the time. Problems crop up with the game's camera. It never gives a good view of the action, and in close quarters it becomes really difficult to see enemies when the camera is zoomed in close on the back of your character's head. For most of the game, this isn't too much of a problem since enemies die easily, but towards the end it becomes frustrating when you're being assaulted by multiple enemies in cramped quarters and you can't see what's going on. To make matters worse, for some reason the teleport function uses the same button as the counter function, meaning you'll often counter an attack when you wanted to teleport away to regain health, or teleport away when you wanted to counter. This leads to lots of needless deaths, especially late in the game.\n\nOther features of Deadpool are less than impressive, although the designers try to cover up the flaws in their game by having  the lead character comment on it. Too bad that jokes about brain-dead cloned enemies, jumping puzzles, and sewer levels aren't funny when the designers don't even attempt to subvert these tropes and just make you go through them while Deadpool cracks wise about how sewer levels are lame and how double-jumping is physically impossible. There's one geniunely inspired sequence about two-thirds of the way through that is imaginative and funny, and while it only lasts for about twenty minutes, it's easily the best part of the game. Deadpool needed to be more like this part and less like the other parts.\n\nCan Deadpool be recommended? Yes, but only if it's discounted at 75% off or greater. Deadpool the character is better than Deadpool the game.","December 15, 2013","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I must admit, though, I'm no Deadpool fanboy, which is probably why it took me so long to play this.  He looks awesome, sure, but I find him a bit too silly and generally prefer a more serious/mature approach to superheroes and the like.  Still, I enjoy a laugh as much as the next person, so I figured "why not".\n\nRight off the bat, the keyboard/mouse controls were godawful.  Like, almost unplayable bad... for me at least.  Thankfully, I have an Xbox controller for just such an occasion, and it made a world of difference.  Regardless, I found it difficult to play for more than 30-45 minutes in one sitting.  In general, the game -- with barely anything resembling a plot, lackluster combat, and an overabundance of lame and crude jokes -- was simply unimpressive and didn't grab me much at all.\n\nBut I pushed on, determined to give it an honest playthrough, and to my surprise it grew on me a little.  With more practice and the addition of weapon/player upgrades and new combos, combat gradually became more fun and exciting.  By the last two levels, I was thoroughly enjoying myself.  It's sad that it took so long to win me over, but I can honestly say now that I'd like to give it another playthrough on the hardest difficulty setting (at some point in the future anyway).  I even have a greater appreciation for Deadpool's humor now.  It just took some getting used to.\n\nAnyway, the combination of everything has made it difficult to decide whether or not to give the game a positive recommendation.  Deadpool may have gotten off to a rough start, but in the end, I had fun with it and intend to play through it again sometime.  It's certainly not the greatest game ever, but all I can say is to give it a chance and it may surprise you.

A beat-em-up style game that was very funny.  It did a very good job of achieving these things and, if anything, surpassed my expectations for what I thought that it would be.  It is very funny. It's definantly up there with some of the funniest games that i've played.  My only major complaint about the game is the controls. They were kind of awkward and in my case, not very easily customized.  Other than that, as long as you don't expect a complex story (which you probably shouldn't with this kind of game), you will most likely enjoy this title.","November 27, 2013","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For what amounts to a God Of War clone gameplay-wise, this game has a lot of buttons to push.  I strongly recommend using a console controller, MMO mouse, or gaming keypad (a la Razer Nostromo).  This game may be intolerable without one of the above.\n\nNow, with that said I have enjoyed this game immensely.  The art style and humor are thoroughly enjoyable, and it makes tremendously creative use of the same half-dozen or so varieties of goons in order to keep the game fresh throughout.  You have a variety of weapons, but relatively little ammo for each one.  Since the ammo drops in game are plentiful yet varied, you get the most out of swapping weapons on the fly rather frequently.  This adds to the gameplay overall, but is a terrible detractor if you are trying to manage this via the default use of keys adjacent to WASD while attempting to stay mobile.\n\nB+, will play the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game.  One handed, if I can.  Just like my man Deadpool.","July 21, 2013","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It makes fun of many cliches on video gaming, along with the industry (like two instances with the game's budget, first making the world 8-bit and then forgetting to animate, script and putting textures on one point before continuing). Also, a lot of Deadpool's lines come from the comic books themselves, like "I know how to say chimichangas in eight languages (from Cable and Deadpool)" and "Shoryuken!" (a well-known moment of DP's history). And of course let's not forget having hallucinations, Pool-O-Vision style and the breaking the 4th wall. Pretty much everything you love about Deadpool.\n\nAnother thing I liked was it has all weapons and upgrades availible to unlock both by buying the weapons and killing mobs. I liked it a lot, since you can have better time buying the upgrades than being unlocked as the game moves.\n\nWhat kinda brings down the excitement is the mediocre gameplay and the price.\nIf you remove Deadpool as he is, it's a generic action game with the same gameplay you are familiar with the last decade or so, the enviroments are uninspiring, even when it takes place to Genosha, a place where mutants were living in peace until Sentinels rose the whole place to kingdom come. We have sewer levels, industry area levels, and many boring places. The combat tries to be over-the-top violent, but it doesn't have much excitement.\n\nBut I believe it IS supposed to be like that, as Deadpool points out all those and making fun of them, becoming self-aware. The same way with Spec Ops: The Line, but being comedy.\n\nAnd what brings my ♥♥♥♥ down to a boil, is the price. This price is unacceptable for a game like this, especially since it doesn't have much replayability, besides some challenge maps (as usual), it's short and it simply doesn't justify this pricing.\n\nIn the end, it all comes to wherever you like Deadpool or not. I like DP and his humour and the whole ride was exciting. Be warned though, it's 18+, not for kids.","December 3, 2013","true","19.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like the Batman Arkham games, combat got to be predictable, but this combat was far more entertaining IMO. The humor was great fun and makes this game stand out.\n\nControl-wise, playing with a 360 controller (I used a DualShock 4 over bluetooth mapped to a 360) was excellent, but I can see how keyboard/mouse would be almost unusable in this game. I routinely used 12 different buttons in a single combat sequence and that would certainly complicate things on a keyboard.\n\nOverall, highly recommended for one or *maybe* two playthroughs.

If you do not know who Deadpool, Cable or any of the x-men are, you might not like this as much as me. If you are a Marvel fan then you will love this. Deadpool is nuts as a hero. The humour in this game is hilerious, i have never played a game where i have hit the escape key in the middle of a tough spot just to crack up. In terms of gameplay and controls, everything is pretty tight, i did have more fun playing with a contoler though. The grraphics are decent, and the writing is awesome. In terms of replayability, it has a game plus and challenge mode that are ok. I prefer the game plus mode using weapons i didn't use in the previous playthrough.\nAnyways, pick this game up, High Noon Studios do amazing stuff with the liscences they get.","December 29, 2013","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Truth be told I expected major disappointment but I have to say, High Moon Studios did an amazing job in capturing Deadpool's character. If you're a fan I'd recommend the game, if not then you don't have much to look for here. The gameplay does enough to keep you going, with an average progression system and multiple weapons (4 melee, 4 ranged and I believe 4 throwables (grenades, mines, etc)) to purchase access to with the points you've earned through murdering anything with an opinion. You also have access to some 'Super-moves'. I found it all rather gimmicky, I loved unlocking the weapons and such for the sake of using them, but I ended up using the duel Katana's throughout. The hack and slash aspect is enough to pass the time when trying to progress through to the next dialogue/story sequence, but is hardly innovative, not something a gamer would go out of his way to experience. Also, I know Deadpool looks like a ninja, but don't expect a focus on stealth sequences, they are few and entertaining for parody's sake.\n\nAt the end of the day, you're playing this for Deadpool. The dialogue will keep you entertained and there is enough of it spread out throughout the game to keep you well satisfied, or at least it did for me. That this game chose to include little minigame segments that aren't really there to punish or reward the player, but show off just how insane Wade is a fantastic choice in my opinion. The addition of other big marvel players (Cable, Wolverine, Domino, etc) is minor to the story but still, it's what you expect to see in the Marvel Universe and frankly between Cable's theme song and getting to B***h slap Logan, I'm sure no one would complain.\n\nTLDR; Gameplay is average. Deadpool is amazing. Play this for Deadpool.","December 29, 2013","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Infact I'd be willing to say that Deadpool manages to come in just shy of the top tier third person slashers like DMC/Bayonetta. This is more due to the fact that it's somewhat average core mechanics are propped up with some entertaining and memorable setpieces along with some fairly strong writing in terms of comedy.\n\nIt's undeniably a bit of a masculine power fantasy game so your millage will certainly vary if you're looking for balanced and reasonable characters. But for all that I've seen people say about Deadpool's game, the game does a reasonable job of laughing at his attitude towards women without really glorifying it.

Throughout the game it had it's high and low moments. The plot is convoluted, the enemies are just varied enough to keep you changing tactics and the amount of available weapons and upgrades keeps you changing things around to meet the situation. It's not hard to just fully upgrade one gun and melee weapon and stick with it the whole game sadly. The challenge maps are tough but fairly fun. My main gripe with the game is it's length and the gun wielding enemies. They will kill you in a heartbeat if you don't upgrade yourself or get to them quickly. The thing this game has nailed down is the humour. There's a lot of laugh out loud moments and a couple of facepalms. Overall, in my opinion, this is a fun game to play. If you're as big a fan of Deadpool as I am, you'll love it too. If you're not a fan, there's not enough unique gameplay mechanics to keep you entertained.

Some games have a story and make sense. Some games have morals and thought. Some games, very few, even have the glorious status of being extremely fun.\n\nAnd some games don't give a f*ck.\n\nDeadpool is one of these games. Featuring the titular Marvel Comics hero, he's a superhero with a healing factor. He cannot die (he can in the game, has to be fair yeknow). He's also completely insane, and is VERY aware of the fourth wall.\n\nWhat follows, then, is a joyous romp of destruction, joy, insanity, fear, pure silliness, and crazy gunswordfights with a guy whose in it for... really, just because he can. The game, if nothing else, is buyable JUST because of Deadpool's personality.","July 28, 2013","true","24.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There were moments I would litterally tear at my eyes with laughter.  Though it is a solid third person shooter, the gameplay isn't anything special, and there isn't too much replay value other than to recapture your favorite Deadpool moments. Despite the title's bland gameplay, I would still recommend this title to any Deadpool fan (preferably when on sale).","July 5, 2013","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Deadpool is brilliantly brought to life by the voice of Nolan North and the writing of Daniel Way, with the humor coming at you as fast and frenetic as the action.  The gameplay itself isn't exactly spectacular, but it's still pretty solid and very fast-paced.  I found myself comparing it to the combat in the Arkham games, but with swords, hammers, pistols, machine guns, laser rifles, and no slo-mo.\n\nThe Bad\nWhile I did praise the writing above, there are a few points where I felt it maybe got a tad TOO cartoony and wacky.  Not often, but it happened.  While Way did definitely deliver on the laughs, I think I might have preferred if they'd gotten Fabian Nicieza to write the story.  All my favorite Deadpool stories were written by him, and I always enjoyed the serious moments of introspection he added to the character.\n\nThere are some unfortunate bugs in the game, mostly having to do with environment meshing.  On more than one occasion, for example, I would try to jump through a wide opening to find that thanks to some invisible walls, only a much smaller section of that space in the middle would allow me to pass.  This would lead to several frustrating moments where I had to climb back up to where I'd been and try the jump again until I got it right.\n\nOverall\nSure, I've got a couple of gripes, but truthfully they're rather small ones, especially compared to the sheer amount of fun packed into this game.  Ultimately, the main reason to get and play this game isn't for the gameplay or the graphics or the story or whatever.  You should get it and play it because it is absolutely hilarious from beginning to end.","September 25, 2013","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's gonna be one hellava day.\nYou arrive home and really just want something to cheer you up.\nThis is where Deadpool pops in. This is a COMEDY game with capital letters! The amount of one liners, sexist jokes and whatever you can imagine has been brewed up into an action game.\n\nDeadpool game is fast paced and utilize a mix between melee and guns. It's hard to focus on only one type, especially guns as the ammo is most welcome and you can carry all 4 different guns. Melee however is what you please to use.\nIn order to earn "DP Points", then you either pick up DP coins around a level or kill enemies. If you're good at juggling all the enemies around and constantly combo them to pieces, then you earn even bigger points.\n\nThere is nothing bad to say about Deadpool, besides being a console game, but it works extremely well on PC. The only slightly annoying part can be the camera when you're in tunnels, or got your "back up" towards walls. The missing overview of the battle can make it hard to counter enemies or avoid incoming hits.\n\nIf you want to laugh your ♥♥♥ off, then Deadpool is highly recommended.","December 24, 2013","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Currently it seems to be all the rage of a game to innovate, innovate, and you guessed it innovate. It appears every game has to have something "unique" about it so water cooler discussions can be more interesting, this game doesn't do that, unless you count pure fun, innovative.\n\nIf like enjoy the Devil May Cry, Dark Sider, God of War series you will like this game, if you also love comics, then you will really like this game, if also you enjoy slap stick commedy with a touch of Leisure Suit Larry you will LOVE this game.\n\nI've played many games where I've said out loud "Wow look at the water reflections", or "The character progression system is amazing", or "The atmostphere is astounding", but its been a VERY long time where I simply said "This game is just so freaking fun!"\n\nGraphics 7/10: Its nothing to shout about but it gets the job done. One saving grace is the comic book Babes! Many of the heroines are bodaciously depicted.\n\nControls: 8/10: simply and functional, the camera narrowing its FOV when shooting yet panning back out when you are slicing enemies is annoying until you get used to it.\n\nSound: 9/10, the humor is just wonderful, its just enough to make you laugh out loud without being too repetitive or annoying. If you like references to cliches, movies, memes, or internet jargon, you will enjoy the commentary very much.\n\nFun Factor: 10/10 Its hard to fully appreciate this game if you merely look at it objectively, this game simply keepings me laughing as I perform aerial combos with guns ablazing.\n\n","December 27, 2013","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
