The game is best played in short bursts, when you have a few minutes to say and hour to spare, and you want something a little more relaxing to play. There are around 45 achievements to earn, leaderboards and those bonus trading cards included as well. I think the developers made a very sweet little game for a bargin price, its worth the full price for sure, but on a sale discount even better.\n\nGame plays great with the Xbox controller, you can use either the back buttons to move left/right or the toggle stick, I find the back buttons easier for me. Also the A button to use any power ups you have purchased with your star coins again you collect in game.\n\nWhat I would like to see is maybe some more backgrounds added as there is only 3, and you have to collect 300 star coins to unlock just 1 of the backgrounds. There is also 10 differant baskets to unlock at a cost of a 100 star coins, plus power ups will set you back 50 star coins.\n\nWhat Ever You Do, Dont Let the Stars Touch The Ground ;)\n\nI also look forward to seeing some of you on the Leaderboards, now catch them Falling Stars and make plenty of nice Wishes ok ;)\n","April 3","true","7.7"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","36","39","0","4"

Thus I bought it right away and not only did it not disappoint my expectations, it even exceeded my expectations in a few aspects.\n\nThe gameplay is minimalistic and for some people it can easily border on boring. You collect stars that you can turn in for points, trying at all costs to avoid the ice that slows you down or the negative powerups. Sounds trivial, doesn't it? And it is, if you decide to not go for the achievements that require you to obtain a score of at least 4000/5000, since 4000 is the point in which hell starts to unleash: the stars' speed increases a lot, making it quite challenging to avoid the ice and the negative powerups. If you do decide to go for these achievements, you'll probably often find yourself sweating, trying to beat your previous score in order to improve your position on the leaderboards; however, the feeling when you manage is quite rewarding.\n\nOther achievements require you to collect coins that drop randomly, most of the times quite far from the star that you are supposed to catch. I found this to be a real exercise in tempering my gamer greediness, since I often had to make decisions like: "ohhhh such a shiny coin!!! do I go for it with the price of losing a life? or do I go for the star, letting the coin die?"; and of course, by the time I decided, both the star and the coin were lost... However, looking back, I find all of this to be a very fun experience.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=658998310\n\nAnother positive experience that I had with the game is related to the attitude of the developers towards their players - I don't recall meeting nicer devs on Steam than the Alister Software team. They are very open to the players' feedback and their response time on the forum and in updating the game according to this feedback is very quick (for example the few bugs that occurred right after the release were fixed in a matter of hours; they also removed some of the achievements as demanded by the players, on the ground of being a bit too grindy; at the time of writing this review, they are working on integrating new features requested by the player base). They are actively oriented towards improving the quality of their game and for this they have my deepest respect and gratitude.\n\nPrice-wise, I consider the asking price for this game to be rather modest, but on a positive side, it makes this little gem accessible to more people.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","April 11","true","18.1"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","3"

It is very relaxing, beautiful and soothing, perfect for someone who wants to play without thinking too much. Which was how I felt when I picked up this game. Not only is this game adorable and colourful, but it is also very fun and at times quite challenging and exciting.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple; Using A and D or your left and right arrow keys, collect the falling stars in your basket while avoiding ice that slows you down. As you are stocking up stars, you have to watch the wind direction and strength as the wind will push your stars around in the air. After filling your basket up, you need to deposit your stars on either side of the screen to gain points. On your journey, you can collect not only stars and ice, but also different coloured power orbs that will either power you up or down. They can either make or break your game. They can boost you by giving your basket some extra speed or stop the wind completely. Other orbs will handicap you by making it hail more ice shards, slow down your basket considerably or have the wind go mental on you.\nWhile playing you will collect “star coins”, which help make your gameplay a bit more enjoyable. You can buy one-time use power-ups; give your basket increased star capacity or a shield for ice protection. You can also unlock additional basket designs and background themes with individual music to customize your gaming experience and make it more personal.\nAfter a while, the game might get a bit boring and tedious, especially if you are going for 100% of the achievements. However, it was not the case for me, as I really enjoy this kind of casual game.\n\nClimb the leader board on the quest for the number one spot as the ultimate star lord or casually sweep the ground for some extra star coins to spend.\nFor the price, it is definitely worth the money. You will get some good hours of fun out of it, especially if you are half-bad at it and you want to 100% it. I enjoyed every moment and I do not regret my time spent as a star collector.\nSo make a wish and catch them all.","May 7","true","8.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

As an autistic person with anxiety, I'm always on the look out for games I can play when I'm stressed out but don't want to be overstimulated. CaFS is a perfect fit!\n\nThe game is endearingly simple: move your basket to catch falling stars and empty it at the edge of the screen when it's full. Blocks of ice and various status altering icons (which do things like increase the amount of ice, or slow down the stars' descent), as well as the occasional burst of wind, complicate this simple task, but they're not frustrating to navigate and instead keep the game from going stale. Collect coins to purchase in-game tweaks like more space in your basket, or spend them on cosmetic changes like basket and background design.\n\nThe background music is soothing but isn't going to put you to sleep, and the sound effects are cute without being super sugary. I'm especially in love with the art style used for the backgrounds, which are simple but distinctly pretty, and the different basket designs. Looking forward to catching things in a coffee pot, eventually. :)\n\nI do agree with other reviews stating it doesn't have immediate replay value for most people because it's so simplistic, but for a buck, even a handful of plays is more than worth the price.","April 1","true","1.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

I wished this game could be a relaxing dodge and catch scroller. But instead I was surprised of the long & empty grindfest for coins and "speedup basket" powerups. It has an easy setup: some sidescrolling screen and deposits on the left and right edge. Stars are falling down, on the second wave there are also falling icecrumbs and many positive and negative powerups. Amazing is this wind changing effect when things falling down they are affected by the wind. Also the soundtrack is a chillout loop music. But then you realize to get some of the achievements you have to collect a minimum of 3.1k coins (2.5k for "Money hoarder" achievement, once reached spend on 2,2k for 22 different basket designs + 600 for 2 new backgrounds + 300 for max upgrade your basket). It needs an insane time until you can go for the highscore run of 5k points.\n\nThe gamedesign lacks of certain things:\n1. The HUD hides sometimes stars so that they appear surprisingly out of nowhere\n2. The playfield screen is a bit longer than one screensize. So you must rush for alternate falling stars at the edges, there's no quicker teleport from one side to another\n3. You only earn points for the deposit of stars, not simply for catching them. If you lose a star (life) your already basket  content star bonus is also lost.\n4. You can bounce icecrumbs and powerups from the side away. Only the icecrumbs are rewarded with tiny points.\n5. Accidently catched icecrumbs slowdown your basket. So you must get rid of them fastly.\n6. The bubble powerup lasts just for 5 secs.\n7. You can activate just one extra powerup in one game.\n8. You cannot upgrade your basket with any more passive skills like size. So the gameplay is pretty much plain.\n\nConclusion: I feel a little bit disappointed after starting this game and playthrough with 100% achievements. Could be deeper entertainment and not so nery grinding in the end. I cannot recommend it to others.","May 20","false","7.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

All the while you need to try avoid catching ice chunks which will slow your movement down.  There are also several negative effects that you want to try and avoid, that are colored red and orange, red being the worst of the two.\n\nYou start each game with 3 hearts of out a possible 5, and if you miss any falling stars, you lose a heart.  Hearts can be caught in the form of power-ups, but they fall pretty rarely.  Lose all your hearts, and it's game over.\n\nThe game slowly but progessively speeds up, so what starts out very casual will eventually turn pretty frantic, and while the game is very casual in nature, things like high winds blowing either left or right can definitely increase the difficulty enough to keep you from falling asleep to the amazingly tranquil music playing in the background!\n\nScoring is only accumulated when you dump your basket on either side of the screen, and the more stars you collect and dump, the more bonus points you can aquire.  Upgrading your basket from the default 5 star capacity to a maximum 10 star capacity with gold coins is my recommended highest priority over other things you can spend your coins on that are cosmetic only such as different designed baskets or different backgrounds to choose from when you play a game.\n\nAdd in the ability to compete with players of this game world-wide to see who is the most epic falling star catcher in the world is a very nice touch as well.  (Top 15 scores is kept)\n\nI know, I know.. this is a long review for such a simple game.. but I think it helps you understand that this game DELIVERS for the price, especially if you tend to like casual games once in a while.\n\nThis game scored an impressive 88% from me in my video linked above, mainly due to a maximum "value" score, along with good "fun" and "controls & bugs" scores.\n\nGreat job to the developer(s) of this great casual game!","March 30","true","13.8"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","16","28","2","2"

Firstly the gameplay itself is quite repetitive as its simplicity prevents it from having much depth: this is made somewhat worse by the first five minutes of each match, where stars fall down in a slow, bland fashion. Secondly, well, sometimes the star spawning will serve you with stars that are basically unreachable or put you into lose/ lose situations: examples are stars spawning on complete opposite sides (sometimes 2-3 times in a row) or situationsa where you'll have to get an ice chunk to reach a star (making you slower and thus ultimately unable to get it).\n\nThe lose-lose situations might be lessened if you decide to use your hard-earned currency to buy powerups rather than wait for them to fall from the sky. It's possible that activating a "basked speed up" bonus at the right time'd make certain star spawns possible but I question the need for such a system to be there when things'd easily be solved by simply changing the game mechanics a tad.\n\nDespite my complaints Catch a Falling Star is still an ok, albeit quickly forgettable, game if you're a fan of the genre and you can expect to enjoy it for a few hours before it gets tedious: for such a low price it's decent enough to get a thumbs up.","April 3","true","3.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

For this price it's a worth-every-penny game, really. Someone said it's a steal even. They are right because you get trading cards too.\n\nIn this game you have a basket, catch stars and try not to miss any. It's like playing Pokemon. You gotta catch them all. You can catch coins which appear from time to time. They are the currency in the game. With them you buy new baskets/backgrounds, as well as abilities. Although if you're playing for high score I suggest skipping these coins as sometimes you can pick only a coin or a star, but not both. So if you chose a coin you may lose a life. Of course, sometimes you can get both but sometimes you can lose both. What I am trying to say is when you play for a highscore just focus on the stars.\n\nThe music in "Catch a Falling Star" it's calm and relaxing, perfect for this game. It's not annoying and I am glad about that because otherwise I'd just mute it.\n\nThe backgrounds are good-looking. I didn't pay them much attention as I was focused on catching stars. When you buy a new background the music changes too.\n\nThere are highscores and you can compete with other people.

It's strangely immersive as the music and the background together create such a soothing gameplay environment that it makes you feel isolated from the real world. It makes you feel as if you are actually staring into the midnight sky and carrying the bucket around like a little child trying to catch what seems like the most beautiful thing in the world. On top of that, the gameplay may seem dull in the trailer, but it's oddly satisfying each time you catch a star and score combos. And the speed of the stars keep increasing as the time goes too, which provides enough challenge to keep you entertained. Not to mention that the devs have just recently added Steam achievements as well, which in my opinion has multiplied the fun by even further.\n\nIs this what meditation would feel like?","April 1","true","9.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That's it.  No fun to be had here.   Another game where almost every Steam review was bought by the developer in exchange for free keys.","April 13","false","3.8"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","1"

The music is bizzarrely unsettling, the repetitive sound effects are grating, the backgrounds are lackluster, and the pot you control is just slow enough to frustrate you rather than calm you. I hate that so frequently it stops the calming mindless action to tell you to deposit the stars to the side of the screen, or stop the session altogether when you let so few stars fall to the ground. A game like this has no room to be unforgiving when its supposed goal is to calm the player.\n\nI hate to be so scathing, but the game is rather blank. It bores instead of calms. There isn't much good to point out when it's has so many flaws and is just... boring in every other aspect. I've never asked for a refund on a game before, but I'm broke, man. Every penny counts. I'll be getting my money back for this.","April 4","false","0.1"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"
