If you haven't tried one of these games before this a perfect one to get you hooked.","December 14, 2013","true","5.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

I wouldn't recommend this particular game to a new player, because other games in the series were better designed and, ultimately, more enjoyable.  Try Nancy Drew: The White Wolf of Icicle Creek or Nancy Drew: The Secret of Shadow Ranch if you're looking for somewhere to start.\n\nLike all games in the series, you play as Nancy Drew, the teen super sleuth who somehow manages to get tangled up in mysteries wherever life takes her.  You choose to play either as a Junior or Senior Detective, with no checklist of tasks to guide you if you choose the more difficult setting.  In this game, Nancy is aiding the "Italian FBI" as an undercover agent, trying to discover who is the masked thief stealing priceless artifacts from high profile sites around Venice.  You speak with suspects, solve puzzles, and find clues that help you discover the true identity of the Phantom.\n\nI'll do the cons first.\n\nCons:\n+ The mode of transportation is pointlessly tedious\n+ Making money requires dancing on stage in a tight, leather cat costume, which is strange for a game designed primarily for children\n+ The same wasp sprayer from Nancy Drew: Legend of the Crystal Skull returns for this game, which makes for a near-impossible task to complete when playing with a touchpad\n+ Repeatedly translating words into English by clicking on them with the dictionary grew tiresome quickly\n+ Locked doors must be unlocked each time you enter\n+ The PDA used to communicate with Nancy's contact with Italian law enforcement is confusing\n\nPros:\n+ The game had puzzles of different levels of difficulty and of vastly different styles, with some reminiscent of puzzles from earlier games in the series\n+ No switching back and forth between characters, as is the case with other Nancy Drew titles\n+ Lots of places to explore and tasks to complete\n+ The story was enjoyable, not as spooky as others in the series, and complex enough to make the case a challenge\n\nThough not the best game in the series, The Phantom of Venice is still solid and worth playing.  Compared to the rest, I'd give this title a 7 out of 10.","June 20, 2015","true","6.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I was a little surprised to realize that I had to learn Italian and German. On the one hand, you get a German dictionary which translates it for you, but it was nice to test out my German lessons. I had been struggling with Italian and worried I wouldn't be able to play as you have to learn the words for things in the game to do a couple of the tasks. It was actually not as difficult as I thought.\n\nThe story was an interesting one and the rendered images of Venice Italy are rather pretty. I just couldn't get enough of playing Scopa either. I may have to play this game again just to learn the value system again for the card game to play with friends. As always, the puzzles were a bit of a challenge, some more than others, and others were easier. I suppose it just depends on what sorts of puzzles you're good at and how you think.\n\nThere were so many locations on the map though and we don't get to see them as we are pretty much only allowed to go to 5 or 6 locations total. It's a pity, since I would have loved to have seen more of the places on the map. It's a minor nitpick, but it still would have been nice. I also have not played the games in order. I like that not too much information is  given about Prudence for those that DO play out of order. However, I do think some of the dynamics were a little complicated. I've learned to click EVERYTHING in this game.\n\nI'd play it again, and for anyone who likes a relaxing puzzle mystery game, this is a nice one. Very few rage moments in this one for me LOL.","July 28, 2015","true","12.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are some interesting and fun puzzles, and trying to solve the mystery is enjoyable as well. There were a few parts that were tedious and downright unenjoyable like a puzzle where you literally match colors for 30 minutes or a card playing minigame where your opponent has unskippable annoying as hell lines where he counts the number of points you each get.\n\nOther than a few points in the game that were just annoying, the game was pretty enjoyable. It's a point and click mystery game; its exactly what you'd expect it to be.","July 31, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
