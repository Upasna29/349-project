The lead dev actually just permanently banned me for simply speaking out against this case of insanity. I was told I was being a "troll", even though my statements made perfect sense and weren't full of profanity. Here it is in exact words:\n\n"You have been permanently banned from all StarForge discussions.\nYou were banned by a StarForge developer.\nReason: Troll"\n\nLet me tell you why this game is garbage:\n\nThe optimization is absolutely HORRENDOUS. I'm talking extremely low FPS on pretty decent machines. The community is filled with angry posts and threads pertaining to how bad the game runs on their PC's regardless of hardware. This would be acceptable in the early stages of ALPHA, but this is ridiculous. The devs have not delivered on half the things that they said would be delivered, and the game is absolutely nothing like they describe/show you in the trailer. You spend 4 hours building a base and log off? Chances are, a bug will cause everything you worked for, to completely disappear. Let's not forget the MADNESS of the terrain. You can be in the middle of an arctic forest, and all of a sudden you come across a desert...Completely connected. This game is an unplayable mess, and needs a ton of work, to which the devs have basically stated, "Future updates on this game depend on future sales". They need to take down the trailer and change the description fo the game. Also, the "quotes" from magazine publishers and such are all from the earliest days. These guys are using old hype for a game that doesn't exist and selling it. This game is NOT a finished product and it never will be.\n\nOne of the biggest issues with the game, is the bugs. As far as I know, people are STILL having trouble saving their bases.\n\nIs it worth $5-$10? Yes - Dependent on whether or not they fix the game breaking bugs.\n\n$25 even with NO bugs? Absolutely not.\n\nThis game has tainted early access for me, and I truly hope that you all take this as a serious warning. I even bought a copy for a friend of mine....What a waste of money.","September 22, 2014","false","24.2"," 5,907 of 6,157 people (96%) found this review helpful 160 people found this review funny","96","907","6","160","222"

Clearly they were here to run with our money from the get go.

Back then the game showed HUGE promise. It was just a tech demo, but it gained popularity quite quickly for its unique ideas and friendly devs.\n\nAll of that is gone now.\n\nNow, the game is now the extremely cookie-cutter basics of a survival game. Building, check, combat, check, enemies, check, but nothing, and I mean NOTHING, makes this game stand out from games like RUST, Minecraft, and plenty of other survival games.\n\nBefore I go into all the broken promises and lies that Codehatch has fed to us, let me answer a question 90% of you are asking. Is the game worth paying $20 for?\n\nLemme put it to you this way, if you have a group of friends willing to play this game, it IS fun...for a while. Finding blueprints on dead enemies can be a great experience, especially if you find a rare one. Building a fort, combating other players, all of these are the game's strong points. However, if you are playing alone or in single player, the game is extremely boring. You will find yourself playing for 10-20 minutes at a time before quitting. The game is also ridded with bugs and mutiplayer lag. Public mutiplayer is a joke, last time I checked there were 3 people playing on different servers. For some reason the devs thought it would be a good idea to make it impossible to delete blocks after a time. Meaning you have to mine them using a drill...which takes a loooooong time. This makes upgrading your fort nearly impossible once you have started on it. Want to delete that tower and move it closer? Too bad, you gotta mine it for 2 hours. Vehicles are another joke. They offer no offensive capability whatsoever. There only use seems to be faster transportation and they even suck at that role, since the terrain is so bumpy. Speaking of terrain, it actually doesn't LOOK bad, but the biome organization is sooo random. You have deserts going into tundras, going back into deserts going up a mountain. It doesn't look realistic or good.  Enemy designs are decent; however I know that a few of the models are from the Unity Engine Dev Kit, not original models. Again, lazy design.\n\nOkay, that is the basic review of the game, overall, without the upcoming rant, I would still not recommend this game. This next portion seals the deal though.\n\nWhen the game first launched on IndieGoGo. They promised stuff like procedural (random) weapons, weapon customization, RPG elements like leveling up your character, gaining skills, structural stress. All of this is not present in 1.0. You will notice that procedural weapons ARE in creative, this is, again, the dev's lazy excuse to say "HEY LOOK!! WE HAVE RANDOM WEAPONS IN OUR GAME HERP-DE-DERP". Plenty of other planned content, the APC, the Space Ships, the Sniper Rifle, the list goes on and on of all the content they PLANNED and PROMISED they would release is not in the game's release. They even showed us in-engine models of the APC.  There are features they added in the alpha, but removed to "work on it a little more before releasing it" and never re-added it. RPG elements, for example. They were added in late alpha, but taken out for more work, never to be added again. Can’t find evidence of this? I’m not surprised, Codehatch has done a very good job of hiding and concealing evidence of anything they did not deliver on.\n\nIf my point hasn't gotten across. Even if you think you can deal with the flaws of the game itself, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. All you are doing is supporting devs that CLEARLY do not care about the game, community, or their company. StarForge is, I hate to say, a stain on Early Access. There are plenty of other games on Early Access that will give you much more bang for your buck. I personally recommend Space Engineers, RUST, or 7 Days To Die. All of those games actually DELIVER ON THERE PROMISES.","September 19, 2014","false","136.6"," 1,796 of 1,858 people (97%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","97","796","1","30","31"

Came back with the news of the release. And wow. If this was it's entry into Early Access it would be exciting, but the fact that this is the 'finished' product is apalling.\n\nThe game at this point is an amalgation of game mechanics with aboslutely no cohesion whatsoever.\n\nCrafting?\n\nYes, there is crafting. But check this out. You need schematics to craft items or create bars of ores. And guess what? You find them at random in the game world. You will surely see a spaceship in the horizon of your spawn point, and that's the source of all the schematics you'll ever need. Why? Because they respawn after a very short period of time. Even funnier, if the spaceship spawns in a slope (where it always seems to be) you will see groups of 8-12 crates come flying down the mountain. Each of them might have a blueprint... Wow. Sit and wait and let the game spoon feed you schematics. It's so unappealing.\n\nBuild defenses?\n\nSure but why? There is no waves of enemies coming, just the evenly spaced mob that spawns at night. More annoying than interesting.\n\nCombat?\n\nUgh, the controls and physics are awkward, and this shows in how the AI attempts to navigate the world. Enemies will flip head over heels when chasing enemies up small steps in the terrain. Literally, they go flying and fall on their backs. I guess they are top heavy and have to much horsepower in their legs?\n\nOh, and let's not forget the game was supposed to sport this modular/procedural weapon system. Mid development videos showed the devs fighting with 4-5 bladded chainsaws. This was quite exciting, and was stripped to be given a very unispired selection of weapons. Each type of weapon has 2 variants, 'rusty/crap' and normal version.\n\nZip gun / Pistol\nRusty Assault Rifle / Assault Rifle\nRusty Chaingun / Chaingun\nShotguns have a 3rd variant, 'double barrel'.\n\nAbout as inspired in weapon selection than Wolfenstein 3D. Perhaps even Wolf3D has the edge since it has a knife. Lackluster.\n\nBugs?\n\nYou like bugs? No, not the in-game enemies. I'm talking about horrible bugs that blow your mind as to why any developer would think that it's 'ready for release'. Video card frying unoptimize code will give you horrible framerates even with gaming configurations. It seems that unless you want to make a shed that is 3X3 in size, with a whopping 1X1 living space, the game will slow down to unnacceptable frame rates. Even with the videos settings dropped down to bare minimum, the performance is horrible. I run a i7-2600k@4.5Ghz with a GTX 670 (ok not the latest in greatest, but still). Frame rates will go sub 30 if you are looking towards a base of any decent size.\n\nThe bug that just made me throw in the towel? Vehicles. The physics are already wonky, but the vehicles are the poor victims. The hover ships? Good luck parking them without having them clip in teh ground, start shaking, or bump around like crazy. But that's fine, if they are wonky to drive and use. Sure. But the fact taht in multiplayer they have a tendency to disapear? That, that's not fun. You mine to ger your hover ship, go exploring to get some more ores. And the second you get out of it far from your base, pouf gone. Same thing happened with a buggy. I guess the buggy is properly named.\n\nSeriously, this game is about to commit opportunity suicide if it dares leave early access in this state. With the wider selection of survival games, this is one you can skip. Minecraft with mods will keep you entertained for countless hours, albeit the lackluster combat. But at least there is crafting progression. If you want a bit more intense combat, 7 days to die is a better selection. And the irony is 7 days to die managed to implement some form of structural integrity. Something Starforge was suposed to have.\n\nShame on the devs.\n\nPS: People, update your reviews if you gave it a postive review back in the day. Now you can see that it's total crap, and you shouldn't leave a review out there that sounds promissing. That's the whole trap of this game, it sounds promissing, but delivers poorly.","September 21, 2014","false","13.1"," 1,162 of 1,202 people (97%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","97","162","1","23","8"

This is what I would like to say for this game, had I not been so gravely disappointed. It has been a (not) fun ride from the original release of this game into Steam's Early Access. A Ride full of a lot of Drama, Lies, Misinformation, and utter disappointment.\n\nThere are many grave issues with this game that I find, including game breaking bugs, and of course the fact that this game is almost nothing like it was originally pitched to be. People used to call this game a scam, and while I defended this game in the past when, at the time, there was still hope for this game, the idea that this game pulled the wool over our Eyes is only ever stronger, rather than diminished.\n\nThe Game Breaking Bugs\n\nFirst I shall start with the most common bugs I encounter in this game, among the many other people who do as well. Objectively these are the worst offenders of the issues I will be listing here today, and the ones that matter most to people interested in purchasing this game.\n\n1.) Player blocks placed by Players are not guaranteed to be saved, and rather, have a high chance to be completely deleted, upon logging out of the game. This bug is encountered by many people, very often, in both Singleplayer and Multiplayer. I personally find this bug to be the sole reason why this game is currently valueless to me, as I believe having a sandbox game that features the gameplay mechanics of placing blocks, this is not only detrimental to the gameplay, but critically destructive to the value I find in this game. The little fun I do manage to find in this game comes from it's Base Building aspects, and this bug makes it nearly pointless to partake in base building, which is a core gameplay feature and one of the few features this game actually has.\n\n2.) The game is extremely unstable. Even on more powerful machines, the game is prone to crashing easily over extended play sessions. While I am very tolerant of game crashes, this game reliably crashes for me within an hour of gameplay, everytime. Other users experience similar play sessions, sometimes even less on lesser hardware. From what all I can see from the error reports, I cannot figure out the actual cause, and it certainly is not an issue of running out of memory on my PC. I have yet to get Starforge to effectively use all of my Memory, before crashing. Not only is it a common problem most/all users have to deal with, but it effectively feeds into the first problem I listed, where all of your player-made blocks and items will be erased. Crashing of course forces you to relog your game, which means you have a good chance of running into all of your blocks being erased.\n\n3.) Digging. The game promises you the ability to dig underground with Drill tools. Unfortunately however, digging underground causes many framerate, and eventually crashing, issues. Simply digging underground too much can harm your gameplay experience, and building underground seems to be a guaranteed way to lose your placed blocks there (even more so than in the other bug, when building on the surface) as well as just making the game eventually unplayable or forcing it to crash, and effectively ruining your save file.\n\nOther Issues worth Mentioning\n\nThis game promises to be a Procedurally, infinite world, that allows you to build into space, and dig to the planet's core.\n\nHowever this game is not fully Procedural. No matter what Seed you punch in on the map generator screen, you will always get the same "Pizza-shaped" terrain of Biomes and Resource Nodes as every other player, within a certain diameter from the center of your map. All of your Biomes are in the same locations, all of the resource nodes for ores. Only the map outside of this Pizza's diameter will actually be fully procedural, and it will typically only contain the same old forest/plains biome that Early Access users experienced in earlier version, completely void of any actual resources or landmarks of real value.\n\nOn top of this, the game has relegated Infinite Terrain to an option, that is best left "Not Recommended" to use. Infinite Terrain serves absolutely no purpose, as no Ores or Important Locations will spawn in the Procedural areas of the game. The only purpose Infinite Terrain allows is for player to explore the empty forest/plains it generates. There is no gameplay value here to be found, outside of seeing procedural terrain with no other gameplay elements connected to it. You will be forced to always return to your original Pizza Origin placement of the map to get all of your resources and items. I should also mention that this game is extremely unstable with Infinite Terrain turned off, turning it on makes this worse.\n\nDigging. Again. Another aspect I would like to mention about Digging in this section is that there is absolutely no point in terms of Game Mechanics to dig in this game. It is enjoyable to morph the terrain, and I would enjoy building underground bases, but not only does Digging wreck your framerate and induce more crashing, while not being a sound place to place your blocks, but it serves no purpose mechanically. No Ores will be found by digging randomly. The only locations you find Ores are within giant Mounds of resources found on the surface, and they will store pockets of resources underneath of those specific locations. Digging at random yields you nothing but more dirt, and serves no purpose other than to dig. There is nothing underground.\n\nThe Broken Promises\n\nFinally I would like to remind people of what this game was pitched to be, and what is currently is not. For reference, here is their original trailer put onto Steam and their Indiegogo Campaign, when I first bought the game: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxBSYit49c8\n\nThe game was meant to have Infinite Space. While I don't know whether or not Space is actually still infinite at this point, I wouldn't care to find out. There is nothing in Space by Asteroids which serve no purpose, except to exist and perhaps look pretty. You can build blocks up into Space, but there are no Space Physics, there are no other Planets to visit, there is no actual space flight, and It is literally just playing very high up on the map. It has no specific elements that are any different from playing or building on Terra firma. Other trailers (since deleted from their official Youtube channel) used to showcase spaceships flying around, and Players moving about in what looked like a troop carrier of some kind, leading Customers to believe that their might have been/would be space gameplay involve spacecraft. The only element of "Spacecraft" we have, is a terribly controlled "Space Helicopter", that is extremely slow, buggy, and often can increase your risk of game crashes. It is basically a painfully slow Elevator device.\n\nPromised Game modes since removed. The game originally pitched that it would have 3 seperate game modes, all singleplayer or multiplayer, featuring different objectives to accomplish. We were to have a Survival mode, Wave survival/base defense mode, and a competitive RTS styled mode involving collector drones similar to peasants or workers in Warcraft/Starcraft games. Of these, only Survival is in the game.\n\nOn the original Steam page and other trailers since deleted, they also promised Structural Integrity to the blocks, where blocks would require proper Structual Support, or else they would collapse (similar to 7 Days to Die). This is not in the game.\n\nThe game also promised to have Parkour Physics of some kind, which originally existed in the game. These have since been removed.\n\nIt should probably also be mentioned that almost all content in this game is from Unity Store Assets. Especially the Creatures you will find: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/10781 ; https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/2591","October 28, 2014","false","22.9"," 931 of 983 people (95%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","95","931","983","22","41"

As a "finished" game, I have nothing but problems.\n\nFirst off there's a huge lack of content, a friend and I were able to go through ALL the game's content in about 8 hours of playing.  There's only 4 enemy types, and no elite enemies or bosses.  Crafting is also very basic with few options for base and equipment building.\n\nNot only that, but the content that's there is buggy.  The bugs range from funny (treasure boxes spawning outside and rolling down a hill, foliage despawning when you use the options menu) to infuriating (difficult to build vehicles despawning when you exit them, dying then running back to your body to get your gear and it disappearing when you get close).  Bugs permeate the entire experience, and the whole thing screams "not finished".\n\nEven things as basic as "grenade throwing animation" and "sitting down in a vehicle" are missing.\n\nI bought this game ages ago as part of their "Founder's club", and the only thing that I got for paying 30 extra dollars is a generic looking tile set, and a recipe for a drill, a ground pounder, and a hat.\n\nThis game had a lot of potential, now it's just dissapointment.","October 13, 2014","false","10.5"," 468 of 496 people (94%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","94","468","496","12","5"

When I first discovered it some two years back, I was thrilled to see what promised to be a very pretty Minecraft set both on and above alien worlds. 'Take my money!' I said, and forked out for the Founder's Edition – not cheap, but worth the money considering the potential the game held. Potential that the devs failed to achieve by a massive margin.\n\nI wish I had forgotten about the game. Actually, I wish I had never found and supported the devs in their quest to push out this incomplete piece of trash they had the gall to call a game. Upon starting the game you are immediately thrust into the promised alien world, lead through a brief tutorial, and then you are set free. Finally free to run around a procedurally generated, completely bland and quite frankly, ugly world.\n\nGameplay; Right off the bat you come equipped with the first tier harvesting implement (And a slightly re-coloured version of that same tool if you're part of the Founder Club. Yep.), some items, and then it's up to you to find blueprints - which drop randomly from enemies - harvest materials in an abysmally slow and tedious fashion in order to build better tools, and build yourself a fort/home to protect you from the grim darkness of the far future. Pretty standard for this type of game.\n\nBut that's... pretty much it. There are some creatures/monsters strolling about, and they can be a danger until you have your first weapon, after which they become little more than a nuisance. You could build yourself a base and keep exploring, but after 30-60 minutes, you've pretty much done everything the game has to offer. And that's assuming you can get that far without crashes or your creations disappearing upon exiting and re-entering your world.\nIt never gets any better. Ever.\n\nGraphics & Sound; Distant objects have very low resolutions, even on the highest graphical settings. This would matter less if it weren't for the fact that their jagged outlines are very clearly visible from fifteen meters away. Nearby objects don't look great either, but it could be worse. One exception is the massive drill tower you start nearby – this has  high resolution textures and give a hint as to how the game could have looked, which only adds insult to injury. The soundtrack is probably the only truly decent part of this game, and it doesn't even work half of the time.\n\nLong story short, don't buy this game. It had a vision that it couldn't reach, so instead it tries to be an awful Minecraft clone and it even fails at that.","May 9, 2015","false","3.0"," 329 of 337 people (98%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","98","329","337","10","4"

Once you've run along the surface for 20 minutes, that's it, you've basically seen everything. Bases are largely pointless or OP depending on how many players you have working together as the defences are derpy and out-wit-able but en masse they are insane. Seeing as there is no physics for the buildings, flying spires are the norm as they are the most effective. Small outposts don't happen and I've never managed to get far enough to get up to the "asteriods". Truely the biggest setback is the bugs, I have built about fifty cars, and ALL of them were eaten by the floor, even the hoverships. The other nail in the coffen is the lack of interest in the map, there's nothing for you to do there, to see, to explore! The landscape is often so jaged and hilly that there's nowhere to go, and there's really nothing to see, no interesting locations, bots or anything. Speaking of bots there's like 8 NPC's in total no bosses and lame spawning (IE within 100 feet of you). All in all, I was really hopeful, but it's been quite awhile and the devs look like they're just out of steam for this project, not that it COULDN'T be fixed just that it won't be.","November 5, 2014","false","130.6"," 382 of 405 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","382","405","8","3"

The vast majority of planned features never got implemented. They were not, to my knowledge, officially scrapped, but never implemented. Then one day, the devs apparently decided they were fed up with actually developing and they announced that the clearly unfinished game was finished.\nAs you can see if you read my other reviews, I'm usually pretty lenient.

Good way to kill a few hours but even the game page is a lie.\n\nTons of guns?\n- Assault rifle\n- Rusty assault rifle\n- Chaingun\n- Rusty Chaingun\n- Zip Gun\n- Pistol\n- Shotgun\n- Double barreled shotgun\n\n8 guns is not tons of guns. There are no single shot rifles, no scopes, nothing like that. The only gun you even need to build is a basic assault rifle. The shotgun is useful but unweildly, the chaingun is just gloriously wasteful.\n\nTons of vehicles?\n\n- Hovership single\n- Hovership Speedy\n- Space Copter\n- Buggy\n\nIt could just be that I've not successfully found the blueprints for other vehicles yet, But what am I going to find? Vehicles don't have working guns on them, but that is ok since you can just shoot your assault rifle out the window instead. There are no space ships as previously promised.\n\nThere was an ingame hint that I read, that said "Raid crashed ships for the finest blueprints" That is all fine and dandy except that what they don't tell you, is crashed ships are coated in radiation or something that constantly hurts you. That again, is understandable, its a space ship right? Leaking fuel or whatever. Except that even in a full suit of the strongest armor in the game, you STILL take the same amount of radiation damage. There is no way to resist it. This turns raiding crashed ships into a test to see if you brought enough health injections with you. It can take awhile to clear the creatures out of the ship too, as well as browse contents of the containers inside. Also on crashed ships, there are... 2 total ships that appear on the map, they look slightly different and have a different layout inside, but they just alternate on the same position. There is no crashing animation, no ship coming plummeting down upon atlas, it just kinda... swaps. The only way to know it has swapped aka renewed is to go and physically look at the damn thing.\n\nOne final point. The blueprint system in this game is hell. Sure it was a nice idea, you have to kill creatures to get blueprints, research those blueprints in order to unlock new stuff to build. But when I've been playing for 10 straight hours, raided the crashed ship 17 times and STILL haven't got the space helicopter blueprint I was promised, that is kind of crap. I did find one eventually, during my next session. The game lacks any kind of sophisticated crafting, for example, in minecraft you can mash blocks together in a crafting table and see what happens. In this you don't even know what resources you need until you find the randomly generated blueprint. The creatures never really level up their blueprints either. Leeches were still dropping me "Service" Armor blueprints well after I had completed a full set of Gaurdian and had a monolithium base. So in other words. Relying on random generation to be able to build is ♥♥♥.\n\nI would not recommend you spend money on this game, sure it is good fun for a few hours, hell it suckered me into playing quite a bit recently, but now that I have the space copter, laser towers etc. I don't have anything to do with them. Save your money, spend it elsewhere.","November 9, 2014","false","21.9"," 326 of 351 people (93%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","93","326","351","11","2"

While I think the soundtrack is nice and the terrain can look interesting, the game itself does not bring anything new to the genre, or at least anything that hasn't already been done before. I also want to add that this game has been in Early Access for roughly two years, and in that time span, not much has changed between the first time I played, and what I played today.\n\nVersion 1.0.3 is at least playable, compared to the older ones, and has an average survival mode. However, the survival mechanics are pretty weak, you simply need to gather meat, which is then processed into an MRI syringe, which you then consume. That's it. Meat is obtained extremely easily, and you can be set for in game weeks after a collection session that lasts no more than 10 or 15 minutes. So far, I feel there is little reason to explore, since the starting area seems to have more than enough for you to survive and thrive.\n\nMovement and combat are also incredibly awkward. Getting hit by an enemy can result in you flying about 200 feet backwards while spiraling out of control mid-air. Weapons consist of your average firearms, utilities, or tools such as a chainsaw. Enemies are also pretty stale, have really weak A.I, and in my 5 hours of playing, I only saw three different species.\n\nGraphically, it is not the most stellar. Lighting is really strange and flickering textures are commonplace. Everything looks sort of paper mache-ish as well, even on the higher settings.\n\nThis game is also very buggy. I understand it's in Early Access but it has been in this state for two years. I frequently find myself clipping in and outside of walls, rocketing up steep cliffs, and getting caught inside enemies.\n\nOverall, StarForge is yet another entry into the ever so popular procedurally generated open world genre. The survival mechanics are weak, the combat is stale, the graphics aren't impressive, the game is buggy, and there is a lack of goals or anything to do. However, the soundtrack is nice, and there is something strangely serene about being a lone half-naked man standing atop a high mountain, wielding a manual drill with a calming synth song playing in the background.","November 23, 2014","false","6.6"," 240 of 260 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","240","260","3","1"

Shameful business practices and careless attitudes leave StarForge resting in the proverbial garbage, and I (along with many others who were blatantly lied to when purchasing this game) wouldn't be surprised if this game is eventually pulled from the Steam Store.","April 30","false","11.3"," 154 of 155 people (99%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","99","154","155","2","0"

The developers have a ton of amazing plans, but I don't think anyone knows for sure if they will be able to deliver on them. Overall, don't buy it now, wait for the game to get further towards being a game.\n\nUnless you like what you see of the current game, don't buy it now, not even at a sale price. Patience is key. I regret buying it so early, and I will wait and see if 6 months or a year down the road the developers start getting this game to be a game.\n\n9/20/2014 EDIT:\n\nSo it's been 2 months short of a year since I put up this review. Every now and then over the last 10 months I've seen this game get a big update. Then I read the patch notes and decide not to launch it. The game has sat on my hard drive for 10 months, and now they proclaim the game is "released".\n\nI don't think the devs are mustache twirling bad guys laughing with their money off of people. Judging by the game's older advertising, their vision was just too far fetched. They tried to reach too far into too many different aspects (it will have multiplayer, and crafting, and building, and infinite worlds, and >insert more stuff here) and ultimately failed to reach any of them. I think the devs were ambitous and wanted to make a good game, but lacked the experience and planning neccesary for something of this scope.\n\nLET THIS BE A WARNING TO GAME DEVS AND GAMERS ALIKE:\n\nDevs:\n\nFigure out what your game will do and won't do and stick with it.\n\nDon't lie to your fanbase. If you do, you've done goofed.\n\nGive your community a clear and concise timeline, and then explain if you fail to reach certain milestons\n\nGamers:\n\nDon't buy early access games that have crazy claims but have no signs of planning and goals\n\nHold devs you invest in accountable for making a timeline. Don't accept "we'll get to it when we get to it" for an answer\n\nSome games are not worth it, even on sale.\n\nIn conclusion, 2/10, would not buy on steam sale.","November 28, 2013","false","1.2"," 502 of 599 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","502","599","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lightnin-pheonyx/recommended/227680/","Lightnin-pheonyx","Barak the Magik Seakow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lightnin-pheonyx/","478 products in account","This was the biggest let down since brink.  And believe me, when I saw how brink was when I bought it, I cried.  Literally.  Granted I was less mature then, but even now I could enjoy those let-down games such as brink.  I could still enjoy it.  NOT THE CASE WITH THIS.  The developers had NO excuse whatsoever to even release this as an early alpha, let alone a full release.  When you play this game, there will be some kind of texture glitch or wonkyness or failure in game coding that always appears after a matter of two minutes.  There is no challenge- enemies are few and far between, are all very repetetive, and easy to kill nonetheless.  Let's go over some of the "promises" the developing team fell short on:\n1. A fully flexible creative mode; you can enter "creative" mode but it is no different than survival.  Only difference is no enemies. You can die, and more insulting yet, when you open the crafting menu it tells you you have an infinite amount of resources; and it doesn't allow you to craft anything at all because you don't have enough resources.\n2. A creative and enjoyable team fortress mode; the mediocre fortress defense I saw in the early alpha was not only neglected, but was removed entirely from the game! All I can conclude is that the developers were lazy in this regard.\n3. Realistic movement with parkour!; Parkour physics were completely disabled.  The movement is nothing short of pathetic; your character flails their arms around like they're doing an olympic 100 meter sprint when you so much as walk.  I actually laughed when I crouched, and rather than bending it's knees, the character literally just SHRUNK.  This game's movement is more wonky than goat simulator's, and goat simulator intentionally made their character physics as wonky as possible to be silly!!\n4. SPACE!!!; Space exists, I'll give it that, but there is nothing significant about it.  Nothing you could find in space you couldn't find in the ground.  Getting there is extremely difficult.  And once you get there, it is essentially nothing more than a picture meant to look like space with your character in a freefall.\n5. Vehicles; it's really tough to explain, but they just aren't good.  They aren't useful, and have some of the most shoddy physics I've ever seen.\n6. Dynamic environment.  I mean, I GUESS it exists.  This is the only promise that was still upheld; however, it's garbage.  You have to take a drill or thumper and stick it into the terrain, at which point all it essentially does is modify the terrain in a way that looks like youre changing the game's code.\n7. Randomized, procedural weapon genertor; this is one of the saddest shortcomings, since the developers actually showed this off as a mostly working feature in the alpha.  You would open a weapon crate, and out would come a gun with whatever design or a random number of barrels, or perhaps even a chainsaw with multiple blades.  I thought "well it's mediocre, but they obviously are taking it seriously!" but no.  THEY TOOK IT OUT ENTIRELY.  There are five weapons in the game, all of which must be crafted and are not randomly generated whatsoever.  Well, ten weapons, if you include the other five weapons that are basically just "rusty" versions of the other five.\n\nThe store page is honestly pathetic.  Those promising quotes you see? Under the "reviews?" Those were from super early alpha, which was no way predicting of the game's current state.  Something that is worth mentioning is the "loot and survive" element mentioned.  You basically have to endlessly scour the terrain looking for the most ridiculously random crates just laying around.  It's ridiculous at best.\nI should say, to say this game's texture graphics look like something that came out of a hippopotamous's rear end would be VERY, VERY generous.  This game makes my 2003 harry potter video game look like crysis.\nAnd the icing, (icing made of fecal matter) on the cake?  These developers are not only bad at developing games, but they are terrible as developers.  If someone politely points out a criticism on the forums, a dev will literally, no joke or misquote, tell them to f**k off.  We get it, you might be proud of your creation, but you're marketing it to real people for real money.  As insulted as you might feel, there is no excuse to blindly assuming a customer is stupid because they don't like your game!!\nLastly, I feel like a should mention the tutorial.  This game is extremely, EXTREMELY confusing to pick up.  I saw it had a tutorial, I thought "oh sweet! A tutorial!" And it told me "wasd moves, space jumps, ctrl 'crouches', and you need a workbench to craft anything."  Yeah, THANKS.\n\nOverall, 0/10 I would rather spood feed my urethra with rusty needles and become an interspecies human centipede with various critters of the jungle.  I would rather be forced to have an intimate moment with one of the bizarrely topheavy aliens in this game.  I would rather stick a toothpick in my toenail and kick the wall.  I would rather cut myself all over and jump in a pool of lemon juice, than I would like to give this game a review that is even 1% positive.","January 7, 2015","false","2.4"," 139 of 140 people (99%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","99","139","140","44","5"

Animals and plants have no relations and nothing seems realistic or in proportion. There is no transition in plantlife between earthly or alien biome, even the textures of the soiltype schange suddenly. No insects, no fishy things, no nothing.\n\nThe landscape textures are terribly unstable and the perspective makes me puke. Water pools look like fast streaming water with the grass sticking out - and all very restless to watch, and the fun of water isn't there, it is water, and that's it.\n\nMining should have been a substantial part of this game, but the minerals are giant shitpiles in the landscape to be found, and that's it. The scheme's for construction are randomly found in boxes, and after a certain number of encounters you've got them all. This is boring.\n\nAnd the algorithm for the objects is to simple - when a monster gets between two objects, a turret and my base or an other object, then my base also has substantial damage - were shooting ourselves in the foot here, this is stupid.\n\nThis game is beyond beta, and some mistakes should have been thrown out in an earlier state - it is to late now, the game should be broken down in its parts and substantial parts of the code should be rewritten.\n\nThe graphics suck (jumping textures, pukable perspective, and vibrating leaves).\nThe whole biome is unrealistic, and the animals behave predictable.\nActive parts should have ajustable parameters (free shooting range, inter-connectivity, triggers, etc.).\nMining should be fun (scanners).\nThe terrain is small and not an open world as was mentioned.\n\nMy verdict; start all over, or throw it away as an failed project.","November 14, 2014","false","153.1"," 167 of 178 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","167","178","6","0"

I was like "wow that cake look's awesome!". They had word's printed on them that said "watch the cake being made, and give feedback on what you would like to see added". "Only $19.99 to get inside and have your cake!". I see a guy standing outside with a Logo of a robot arm looking thing on his black t shirt. He holds out a paper to me and a pen and tells me i have to sign the paper to get in. I glance at the paper and skim it over fast "blah, blah, blah." Nothing to worry about. I sign the paper with the pen and hand him my $20. He unlocks the door and steps to the side, letting me walk inside. I walk inside and see two other people. Sitting on the right hand seat is a man that looks angry, sitting on the left seat is a woman that looks very happy. I take the seat in the middle, and get my first look at the table and the cake on top of it in the center of the room. It's a vanilla cake, and seems to have a squid tentacle and a bunch of cockroaches inside.\nAnd it also seems to lack any frosting or decor of any kind. I sit in the waiting room, and look at the "cake" for what feels like a long time.\n..............................................................\nAfter a while, the Angry man leans over and whisper's in my ear. "The baker's have not come out in like forever and i heard they are not even good at making cake! They don't seem to know what they are doing at all, 'ugh'". After that he returns to his normal spot, and i sit there for a while longer before the Happy woman leans over and whispers in my other ear. "Don't worry it's a work in progress, i mean look at all that potential! Anyway, i'm sure the baker's will come out soon and show us something awesome!". After that she returned to her normal spot and we all waited.\n...................................................................\nAfter a log time, one of the baker's comes out of a door in the back room where they must have been working, he adds some sprinkle's that are brightly colored. Then turns to leave. "WAIT, that's all your going to add?" say's the Angry man. "(mumble), (mumble)" says the baker. And he walks back into the workroom.\n"But look, now the cake is more brightly colored and you can have it look better." says the Happy woman. "But it's not really fixing anything is it...." the Angry man said. More waiting.\n.......................................................................\nAfter more time the baker comes out and spread's some frosting over the top of the cake, trying to cover the squid  tentacle, but he can't quite cover it, and the cockroaches are still sticking out the side of the cake. "The cake is now in it's BETA stage" He says. "But it's hardly any change from what it used to be!" Says the Angry man. "SHUT UP!" Says the Happy woman. From there they start screaming at each other, and unnoticed the baker slip's back to the baking room.\n.........................................................................................\nAt some point they instal a little slot in the bakery room door that\ncard's come out of that hint at the next change to the cake.\n............................................................................................\nI walk out the metal door.\n\nOn the way out i see the guard. I ask him\n"Hey can i get a refund for that 'cake'? It kind of sucked"\n"Remember that paper you signed?" He asks me.\n"Yeah, i remember." I say.\n"Well if you had really read it, you would have seen in the fine print\nthat it says 'no refunds'" Says the guard.\nHe hands me a heavy book and tells me to look at page 349.\nIt takes me a second but i find it. "No refunds, ever"\n"WHAT? I just signed that paper" I say.\n"By signing the paper you agreed to every rule in this book"\nSays the guard.\n\n\nFed up i walk away down Bakers street.\nThat's the last time i sign a paper like that.\nFor  some dumb cake.\n\nOr so i told myself.                                                                                                                                                                                    .................................................................................................................................................\nMonths later i walk down the bakers street once again looking for the CakeEngineers bakery. I see that the Cake}{atch bakery now has posters on the outside saying "The cake is done at last! Thanks so much to all the people who supported us!". "Hemmmm" I Think to myself. "Maybe it's the chocolate cake i paid for now". I walk over to the entrance, and give the guard a dirty look as i walk past and open the door with my key. I walk inside. It takes my eyes a moment to get used to the lower light level. I see my old 'friends' the Angry man, and Happy woman sitting in the same to chairs as last time. They both seem to be just sitting there numbly and looking at the 'finished' cake. It's the same. Same frosting same vanilla cake, same squid tentacle. And same bunch of cockroaches inside. The only new thing is some brown icing on top. The head baker comes out the metal door. He takes off his apron, and drops it on the ground. He starts to walk out the door. "WAIT" says the Angry man. "What now?" Says the baker. "You can't just leave it like this. It's not even close to being done" Angry man says. "More people would have to buy it. We ran out of money" says the baker. Then he walks out the door. "They just quit. I can't believe it" says the Happy woman, tears in her eyes. I glance at the apron. It has the name 'Will' stitched on the left breast. "Well there is nothing for us here now" I say. We all walk out the door.\n\n\nThe real end\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvideo review. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_2o-0Ayenk&list=UUFygCHiWPjqQsgr5fYhp47g\n\nIf you want a cool inside story here is Junos (the old CM for the devs) redit post about her time working for   Codehatch http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/2dhpvd/starforge_developer_misconduct_a_look_back_from/","May 21, 2014","false","3.5"," 308 of 388 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","308","388","3","42"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dacrazycoder/recommended/227680/","dacrazycoder","Budeholly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dacrazycoder/","270 products in account","UPDATED - July , 2015\nSummary I've watched this game for over a year now and its still garbage in my opinion. The developers are clearly unable to provide a quality product.\n\nIt has improved, but the multiplayer servers are dead and single player is very bland. Don't be fooled by the trailers - they are still not representative of the current play experience.\n\nOverall, the game was a waste of cash and time.\n\nFull Review Below:\n\nDeveloper ActivityThe game is done.. no more updates. Sorry, everyone got shafted.\n\nMultiplayer1. The game now has multiplayer arena style support - however.. at 7:30pm EST it looks like most servers have less than 4 people in them.. So I don't know how well multiplayer will work - given that it's summer (kids are out of school..) and the servers are dead. It could end up being a very lonely experience.\n\n2. There are two game modes - Creative and Surival - however, the servers seem to only be running survival mode.\n\n3. It's desolate.. I can see some buildings from players, but without people online, it's hard to tell if there is a game here.  I was dropped with a drill, some stims (heal?) and a red thingy.. not much to do. Its like a lesser version of minecraft.\n\nGame Engine Engine has improved, reduced lag, voxel tearing is reduced.\n\nMy Specs:  i5 @ OC' 4.5ghz, Nvidia 660, 16gb 2400mhz\nGraphics Settings - Below are FPS I'm seeing with the above specs.\nFantastic = 20-30 fps\nGood = 40 fps\n\n1.  The engine has improved, it is far less laggy than it was previously.  The fps is much better - they seem to be making headway on the technology and the game engine. It's still based on Unity, and it shows.. the frill will 'appear' at short distances, then disappear - a tale sign of the underlying engine. These are all things that will be tough for the devs to overcome as it's a flaw/feature of the base engine. If your a graphics critic - this is likely to turn you off.\n\n2. Drilling is working far better - though, it's still a bit glitchy with the terrain popping around.\n\n3. Models and textures seem to have been updated. In the 'Fastest' setting, they are plain and flat, while they tend to get reasonable on the higher settings. Tearing and rendering from various view angles is still glitchy - barbed wire appears/disappears at random, etc..  again, if your anal about a pictureque world, you'll be disappointed. While looking at the trailers, they have obviously been touched up as running it on the highest setting, doesn't seem to yield similar results in regards to draw distance/object culling issues.\n\nThe terrain has improved in terms of frill.. lots of little trees, and bushes in the plains, but the mountains and caves are still rather bland. Big gray masses with repeating textures - not that appealing.\n\n4. Creatures - There were some creatures, a few smaller ones.. One major improvement, when night fell, I didn't immediately get swarmed by large worms and die. After a bit of running, I did manage to fall into a  pit filled with them.. so they are still around.\n\nThe creature AI is very sluggish - often taking several seconds to realize that a player is nearby - this sorta ruins the solo survival experience, if the creatures just stand around and die.\n\nOverallThe game has improved, but with multiplayer being dead, crafting being mediocre at best - I still cannot call this a game. It's basically a tech demo with quite a few visual glitches. Certainly not worth the $20 price tag that is being asked for it.\n\nIt feels like the developers have not figured out the final direction for this game.. it's a bit of minecraft, a bit of a fps - but it doesn't do either one that well.\n\nOn the forums, there seems to be contention over the arena gameplay, numerous posts about pvp removal, and other aspects that hint at a game without a clear direction.\n\nThe developers have made strides in the right direction - but it may have been too little too late.  I would pass on this one for the time being, give it time to come out of Early Access. This is definately a wild card as to what will end up happening to it in the future.\n\n\n[REVIEWED -  March 6, 2014]\nThis game is coming along.. but it has been a letdown the entire way.\n\nMain flaws:\n1. Collision is terrible and jerky - tough to get a feel for what is actually working.\n2. Updates to the game are slow\n3. Its pretty much a sandbox, so there is not much to do.. The final design is up in the air. (It's a tech demo right now)\n4. Developers seem very misleading.. lots of issues with transparency in the project.\n5. Management of Kickstarter/Early Access funding is sketchy at best.. Not alot to show for the cash provided.\n\nThe game is written using Unity - which has given the developers alot of freebies (NGUI for the UI - paid version, base physics.. etc..) However, they seem to be failing to leverage alot of those features. It has taken them a very long time to get to where they are at.. The good news is that they seem to be producing 'something' right now, but that something isn't exactly fun.\n\nMy suggestion:  Watch the game to see where it goes, but don't waste your money at this time.  It's 'iffy' as to what the final product will be and previous actions by the developers have shown that they are not likely to deliver a solid product.","March 6, 2014","false","2.8"," 412 of 538 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","412","538","0","19"

I really bring it upon myself to look for the best parts of games, opposed to the most negative parts, while still maintaining an equal review covering all that you might expect good or bad. Unfortunately this game made enough of an impact on me to recieve a thumbs down.\n\nI remember this entire game, back when it was nothing but a small demo with the vision of something phenominal, was the most intriguing and promising game I had ever seen at that point. When I realized they had raised an immense ammount of money, I bought the Founders Pack on the spot. I whole heartedly thought, regardless of their small team, they should have more than enough resources to build, stabilize, and polish the entire product in a few years (Taking into account that content or in game features may lack with staff size and so forth, but nothing future updates couldn't fix).\n\nInstead, after all this time, the product they released as their Official 1.0 release, feels like an atrocious scam. I can barely play this game without feeling stressed or overwheled by how many issues there are graphically and gameplay wise. Not only does the game lack promised content, but the performance is disgusting. Now, I would like to state that I have a Fairly High end Machine that can play a great deal of games on max settings, however I can only manage a smooth gameplay on lower than medium settings on a resolution that is lower than my native setting. I cant dig to much without getting large quantities of underterrain map exposure and I refuse to go into space anymore, soley because when i go up high enough I refuse to look down for fear that I have to look at the brain liquifying graphical abyss they call an atmosphere.\n\nI want nothing more in all my heart to tell people to buy this game and that it is everything i could have ever hoped it would be, but I could never live with myself for telling the biggest lie possible to someone. I really do hope that they don't beleive success of future updates is solely dependent on future sales, cause if that is the case I would like to shed light on the possible idea that there is a slim chance for that to actually happen when your game is not even worth the stock price. I truly wish the Team behind the game the best of luck with any possible future development on this game or any other projects you find yourselves occupied with, but would issue caution (Especially when hyping up a game that comes out unfinished/unpolished). I am positive a good portion of the community on steam and other various media sources will tear your future ideas apart, and grind your name to the ground if this game is all you have to show for yourselves.","October 12, 2014","false","28.8"," 88 of 94 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","88","94","0","0"

Had lots of good ideas.  The alpha and beta versions gave a sense of impending greatness, if performance issues were dealt with.\n\nThey weren't.\n\nStarforge failed to deliver any of its promises.  _ANY_ of its promises.  It was rushed to market thanks to severe financial mismanagement.  The "release" version of this game isn't any different from the beta versions.  The graphics are utterly unoptimized, causing  low framerates even in the very beginning before you build anything.  The lighting is awful, with the game being either bright enough to hurt your eyes or so dark that even Doom 3 would say "Jesus H, this is DARK!!"\n\nGame breaking bugs are _everywhere_.  More than half of them were present way back in the early beta versions.  There's nothing to do in the game either.  After trudging around the map for about 4 hours, you have seen everthing it has to offer.  The inventory and crafting interfaces are arcane and confusing.  Getting hit by enemies can launch you absurd distances.  The caves that dot the map are generic, sprawling, and contain nothing of importance.\n\nStay far, far away from StarForge.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Steam screenshots for this game came from early alpha and beta builds of the game.

It looked like it could be the "next big thing", filled with exploration, building, and fighting aliens. However, that was not what the beta was. The beta was nothing more than one clunky, poorly coded and balanced pile of nonesense that I couldn't even stand playing for long.\n\nSo of course I do what most do with an early access game: I simply let it be, follishly thinking that it would get better. This led to me launching it once every few months in hopes of seeing some improvement, but it barely did. The graphics are still horrendous (definitely NOT like the screenshot or trailer!) even on a high end computer at max settings, the ai for the monsters is bizarre and confusing and many of them just look odd, and if you want the building exprience this game offers then you might as well get hammered and play with legos, because that's about how coordinated and fluid this game's building system is.\n\nI rarely regret games I purchase, but this is definitely one of those exceptions. This game SHOULD NOT be in anything else other than early beta in the state it's in! So turn away before you waste $20 on something so poorly made like myself and many others did!\n\n\nUPADATE: I would still love my money back for this utter con of a game.

I was blown away amazing graphics smooth gameplay perfect optimization just everything looked awesome.  So 1 year later pulled the trigger bought it and just rolled with it,  I got in and said "Alright, it's early access it will still receive updates"  about 1 year later it was released and to my surprise none of the problems were fixed.  I further looked into this issue to find that they had spent all of their kickstarter money.  I was really dissapointed it seemed so promising but nope guess not.  The next day I went onto the steam client to see that starforge was no longer receiving updates and it had the early access sticker removed.\n\nPlease don't be like me it's not as good as it looks and it isn't even close to what they promised.  If I could refund it I would but I already played past the max hours to get a refund.  You know how people say it's better to give it a try yourself before listening to others?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CDFW/recommended/227680/","CDFW","Riko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CDFW/","1005 products in account","This game legitimately makes me angry it even exists. The game itself is an atrocity, the devs and community is what puts the cherry on the top of this terrible cake. Especially now that it is actually a finished game, the game just screams out how terrible it is.\n\nWhat is wrong? Everything.\n\nWith the newly added 1.0 features in the game in particular, it does not help they are poorly implemented, and glitchy beyond belief. The water/lava plane is ugly, and does not work well with the voxel terrain, and EVEN the voxel terrain is still having rendering problems, almost 1.5 years since they introduced it. The character and creature models are abysmally bad or are canned stock assets the developers tried to pass off as their own work. The soundtrack is just random selection of noises strung together to appease the kids who listen to modern day garbage music. As well, the indiegogo rewards they implemented in the game actually break the Indiegogo terms of service, as they never communicated with the backers that they were changing what the rewards actually were. This update is both terribly done, and is actually illegal in some respects. Heck, calling this a full complete game should be a crime in its own right.\n\nMoving onto the game's theme: the game is one of those style games that tries to hop onto too many bandwagons for its own good, trying to appeal to as many of steams userbase as possible, without satisfying any of them to any degree. Anyway you look at it, whether its the actual gameplay, or the music and sounds, it is terrible and cliché to no end.\n\nThe game runs worse than Skyrim with max everything mods, with enb's, running on my easy bake oven that I had when I was six years old. Now that the game is finished, performance is a major criticism I have towards this game. Even on the best machine, the game struggles to perform on the highest settings. I know this is an indie game, but this is performance I expect from laptops, not top of the line rigs.\n\nThe game is not fun in any way, except maybe in a Gmod style sheer stupidity of the whole situation-style of fun. Many people who say they “have fun” may just be secretly regretting their purchese and just want to justify spending upwards of $75 dollars on this game.\n\nTo compound this, the game's community is pretty much dead and dying. The forums are barren, most of the old regulars have moved on, and the player base is a ghost town. Only time play numbers raise by anything is when there is an update, but by now, nobody seems to care anymore about the game, so even then the numbers only raise slightly. Source[www.steamcharts.com]. Even after the supposed Beta update “fixed the game”, the player number still trail off pitifully to dismal numbers. Now extrapolate this to the full game, within no time at all after the release, and with no more major updates, the player base will dwindle even further than it has in the past, until it only has 10 people left playing it like it did not too long ago. This is not good for a multiplayer hyped game.\n\nThen of course, there is the developers, who happen to be the reason I am writing this review. They produced updates at an abysmal pace, and released very little noteworthy content when they did make something. Now that the final release has arrived, they have pretty much stated they will not add any meaningful updates to the game anymore, pretty much assuring that they are abandoning it. Their “backend tech” fails on every corner, as it none of it works properly, or the stock unity versions are far superior then the custom one they made. In the past they used to cause community upheaval by making promises to do something, then never fulfilling these promises.\n\nThis is what we call lying. They did it quite a bit, but they seemed to have learned their lesson. But would you want to trust someone who lies to their player base about updates, and update schedules, with making a game with your money?\n\nThey made numerous other highly questionable and shady actions, like unceremoniously canning their excellent community manager from 2013, and replacing them with someone who caused innumerable PR nightmares. If this is their idea of a good decision towards “improving” the forums, then I would question their decisions regarding their game design as well, as the game thus far is a monstrosity. To add onto this, they even fired the second community manager, as well as ALL their experienced developers. They tried to do everything themselves, and ended up causing an even bigger mess. Source\n\nThe best analogy I can come up for the game it is like the monster Frankenstein. It has changed so much over its development, from starting as a F2P MMO shooter, to a space epic being able to fly across the stars, to a sandbox building game and tower defence strategy game, to finally a mishmash of all what it used to be into one messy monster. Is is just a complete disaster.\n\nI feel sorry for the people who paid money for this game, especially the game's legend perk owners. Let's just forget this game happened, and move on to better things.\n\nJuly 12th 2014 Edit: redid review for the beta version.\nSeptember 22nd  Edit: Redid review for 1.0 release","April 13, 2014","false","34.7"," 1,029 of 1,498 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","029","1","0","148"

Seems to be another "take-the-money-and-run" early access title, much like Kingdoms Rise and Cube World in that regard. Why even waste your money on this when Planet Explorers exist anyways? From here on, I'm not going to touch anything with "early access" in the title. Tired of getting burned.\n\n(Old) April 2013: It looks promising when you check all the trailers. Then you put the money in the game and all the cool things you saw in the video have been taken out because the dev's don't know how to code anything.

After watching the original trailer (which I can no longer seem to locate), my friends and I bought a 4 pack of the pre-release game. We launched it shortly after, and yes before everyone goes "but it's in alpha" we knew this upon starting.\n\nIt took us over an hour just to get it running. It was laggy, non-intuitive and totally not at all representative of what the trailer showed. Turns out upon further investigation, the trailer was "simulated" gameplay not actual gameplay. Almost a year and a half later, the game is actually LESS functioning then the original. They've patched on a few bits here and there, but it's mostly just held together with some super glue and strongly worded prayers.\n\nWorst, after making a ton of money from their indiegogo campaign and from their pre-release sales, they've simply run out of money. They've released the "full" version, which barely functions, with the "promise" of updating the bugs at a "later" date. And any future updates (aka more features, including almost all of the original promised ones) will "maybe" happen, if they make more money. If their past updates are any indications of what these could contain, I'm even more skeptical. I believe there have been four in the past 1.5 years... all have been lacking and oftentimes a patch would be released shortly afterwards which essentially removes all the added content from the update (due to all the bugs/non-playability issues). They even removed the ability to host your own server, because too many folks were having issues even getting something stable to run. :-/\n\nSo much disappoint.

The updates coming from the developers at Code}{atch are quite like the updates from DayZ which have been adding things to the game that the game currently does not need. Such things include a rifle that colors structures and items or a new shiny tile that you can build buildings with. These "updates" don't help the game's progress, what the game really needs is optimization so it can at least be playable. They have been recently focusing primarly on multiplayer with a game that you can barely play as is which in my opinion is not the way you should develop a game that isnt finished to begin with. In short the game SHOULD NOT be bought at its current stage. All negativity aside, the game *if Code}{atch does what they promised* WILL be very fun and may even be the "new" Minecraft.\n\nPros: The game is graphically beautiful\nHas amazingly great potential\nVery VERY deep digging\nAlot of upcoming features\nInteresting creatures\nPerfect and amazing geography\n\nCons: Slow and meager updates most of which don't help the game\nHighly unplayable beyond expectation\n\nMy thoughts: Needs alot of work and main focus needs to be redirected to the real problem of unplayability. Do not buy if you expect alot of content or hours of entertainment.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Update 0.5.7*\nTHIS is the kind of updates they SHOULD have been doing in the first place! So far I am very pleased\nwith the additons, they even optimized a good bit enough to be playable. I put a few more hours into\nthe survival mode and I like what I see... BUT will this change my view as well as the other players' view?  To be honest... maybe but still not enough to give this game a thumbs up. If Code}{atch keeps pumping on the updates with LOTS of content and a bit faster than they have been, then the future of StarForge will be profitable and might be worth buying into "Early Access".\n\nLets look at the pros and cons of the recent update...\n\nPros: Better optimization, its actually playable for once\nLooting of Leeches and other creatures\nMore lights\nWorking doors\nMany many bugfixes\nMemory dumping fixed\n\nCons: Physics of Leeches are very poor due to them chasing me by flopping everywhere (they should have fixed that before they released the update and they were not like that before the update)\n\nMy thoughts: Love the update but I have a feeling that the update train is going to be "delayed" due to Code}{atch's void of updates. Is it worth buying yet? No, but it might be if they provide loaded future updates like this one. I dare Code}{atch to prove me wrong. Still not enough playability to call it an "Alpha", I have seen alphas that had more playability. One of which is Stonehearth ( http://stonehearth.net/ ) and best of all, they actually tell you what they are working on currently very very VERY often and you can even watch them work on it. So if you want to see a company that actually has their stuff together, check them out and you will know why I am not happy with StarForge's lack progress.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nUpdate: 0.9.1\nI am unhappy to report that Code}{atch's StarForge has (of course) ran into even more problems... The problem's origin is not of the game's fault... but of the "Developers". Code}{atch has said and I quote... "We have had to unfortunately cut a feature we had looked into previously. Stress simulation will not be appearing in StarForge due to major performance concerns. In our efforts to create an infinite voxel world, that works in a connected online environment, our performance is already heavily taxed, and our findings shown that stress simulation would not only negatively impact performance, but make it un-playable for a large degree of our community. As well, we felt it would not fit very well design wise, as this would force players to constantly worry about every little detail while building their fort, and in a game with limited resources, this could cause great frustration when it comes tumbling down, especially a world with explosives and guns. We apologize to anyone who had their hopes up for the Stress Simulation. Unfortunately this is the reality of game development, as some great ideas don't always work out the way we had originally imaged them. A small R&D tech demo showing off a tech feature doesn't always translate well into a good, robust, big, multi-layered game. - See more at: http://starforge.typepad.com/starforge/2014/08/weekcodehatch.html#sthash.kSIyIy9W.dpuf"\n\nWait wait wait... What?! So what I am gathering here is that Code}{atch is removing features because of CPU performance issues?! So because of that they decide to not to do what they promised? Are they not developers? Their job is to MAKE a game and FIX the problems but instead they just decide "Oh well, its too hard." and give up?\n\nOh and this made me mad. "Unfortunately this is the reality of game development" Game development? What development? I don't see development, all I see is a tech demo with the word "game" slapped all over the cover with false promises. Its bordering on fraud.\n\nThey did get one thing right though, This IS the reality of game development, and its all over steam.\n\nPros: NONE\n\nCons: Code}{atch needs to give out the source code for the game and let someone who knows what they are doing get it done for them since we cant rely on them anymore.\n\nMy Thoughts: I am sure thats already obvious. I want my money back.","March 8, 2014","false","22.9"," 386 of 595 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","386","595","0","4"

As of this writing, the last update was a year ago.\n\nThis game is, in my opinion, one of the great tragedies of Steam. It was a very promising game with great potential that died a slow and painful death. I hate to admit it but I like playing the game. Unfortunately, it has so many bugs and shortcomings that despite my personal enjoyment, I can't recommend to anyone that they buy it, even on sale. If the developer was still working on it, if he was still trying to fix the bugs, I'd give it a thumbs up, but in its current state - THUMBS DOWN.\n\nAs for the game itself -\nIf you image a game based on the "bug planet" from the movie Starship Troops, only instead of a volunteer in the military you're a prisoner from a crashed spaceship, then you've probably got a pretty good idea of the storyline for this game. Now throw in the "collect resources and craft items to survive while trying not to get killed by your neighbor" aspect of Minecraft and RUST, and you've pretty much nailed down the concept behind the whole game.","December 13, 2015","false","403.8"," 33 of 33 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","33","33","4","1"

Rather than turning a new leaf after all the negative feedback, the devs continued to sacrifice features to push the game towards release. It's pretty I suppose, but far from an apparent finished product.\n\nPlain and simple, this isn't the product that everyone got all excited about a year ago when it first was introduced to Steam through the Early Access program. Even looking past the missed expectations, there just isn't much of a game here. The only real activity to do is explore a precedurely generated world with a few biomes and shoot at the uninspired creatures that roam the otherwise uninhabited wastes.\n\nMaybe that's enough for you and your buddies, but honestly, it's not for me. Before you take a chance with this game, really do your homework. Read more of these reviews, watch gameplay videos, or just spend your money elsewhere.\n\nYou aren't missing much.\n\n\n[Edited 28/11/13]\n\nAt this point in time, it's hard to reccomend Starforge. Updates have been scarce and in it's current state there isn't too much to do. It just isn't worth the $19.99 pricetag, but if you are really curious about this project, pick it up on sale.\n\nThat isn/'t to say that this doesn't have potential. Minecraft meets Halo sounds like a pretty sick idea and the potential features the devs mention will make Starforge an incredible game. That is, however, if it ever becomes more than just an Alpha. If that ever happens, I'll be more than happy to re-review it and give it a glorious recommendation.\n\nA recent update really changed the feel of the game. The beautiful generated worlds and the addition of digging has really given Starforge new life. Hopefully it doesn't take so long for an update.\n\nThat being said, keep an eye on it. It should turn out to be a pretty amazing once it is done, or even if it gets more updates, but until then, let it stay on your wishlist.","November 28, 2013","false","6.2"," 85 of 117 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","85","117","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rathlord/recommended/227680/","rathlord","Rathlord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rathlord/","267 products in account","UPDATE: I see the game is on sale again. To TL;DR for everyone looking at this game, DO NOT BUY IT. Devs are liars, they made tons of promises they didn't keep, they actually removed features that never got added back, and then they slapped a 1.0 title on it and moved on. They also completely censor their forums of any negative feedback (and probably would with the reviews as well if they could) and only let people who own the game post on their discussions. These are the worst kind of devs and the worst kind of people. Game is not worth $ 2.50 and they don't deserve your spare change anyways.\n\n\nI should preface this with review with this- I was once an owner of this game on Steam. It is now and probably forever will be the only game I've ever asked for a refund for, ever, from anywhere.\n\nOriginally, I bought this game after watching a few short reviews that gave it good praise for potential and watching the EA video. This was a mistake on my part- you see, some of the videos were a bit older and I assumed when I watched the EA trailer that the game had gotten more features (the stuff I saw in the EA video). In reality, the game had *lost* most of the features I had seen in the review videos, and the features it showed in the EA video- which explicitly stated "these are the things you can do in Starforge Alpha" were not, indeed, in the actual game.\n\nSo there was a humongous amount of false advertising, and I felt very, very burned by that. Valve made Starforge devs change their video because it was false advertising of the worst kind.\n\nPlease understand, if they'd been honest about their game and what it's current state was, that would have been fine. I don't have any problems with EA titles being unfinished or buggy. But it was a combination of the fact that the game was utter garbage (at the time just a boring, stale tower defense mode and an "open world" that was really just empty landscape with no ability to find extra resources or literally ANYTHING to do but walk around) *and* the fact that they lied about their product.\n\nI see now that the game is "finished." I'm not really interested in putting more time into researching, but if you're thinking about getting it and you saw the EA trailer you might want to check on some things. Did going into space get added? That was a feature they claimed was already in. How about that awesome free-running we saw where the guy was tied to the back of the jeep and running behind it while being tossed around with cool physics- did that ever get added? I don't know. These are things you should look into if you're going to buy, though.\n\nAs for the game itself, please note that these things may have changed, but at the time I played it, it was boring, the action was absolutely stale, the guns were ridiculous looking but didn't have the ridiculous results you would hope for with such a spectacle. They all did exactly the same thing- put identical bullets downwind. It didn't matter whether you had a triple chainsaw double machine gun pistol. It just didn't matter.\n\nMoving around always felt like your character was riding a unicycle, oddly tilty and awkward, falling over and reacting to the physics engine in the weirdest way possible.\n\nThere was no skill or challenge to the combat, just point the right way and wait for a few minutes and one of the dull, uninspired monsters would eventually die.\n\nIf this sounds like a scathing review- it is. I've played Flash games on Newgrounds I thought were better designed and more fun. Coupled with the false advertising and utterly unapologetic devs, even if this turned around and was the best shooter on the market now, I still wouldn't give them my money, and if I were you, I wouldn't either.","September 24, 2014","false","2.4"," 45 of 53 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","45","53","0","0"

So your money will also go to making everything the best it can be. Link to the Starforge Indiegogo page.\n\nStarforge is a game funded through Indiegogo. With 135.453$, and almost 5000 backers, Codehatch funded the project for 181% of the original 75.000$ goal on the 29th of November, 2012. They were set up to make a fantastic game, and everyone believed they could do it. Even  Markus Persson did. CodeHatch had made a  prototype video  showing off what they’d already made, and it looked amazing. You’d say it could only get better from there on, right?  But, as you probably already know, it didn’t end up that way.\n\nIn March 2013, the game arrived on Steam in Early Access, and when my friend told me about it, I was immediately very interested. Bought it almost instantly. And when we booted up the game together, and we were greeted with a flat desert survival map.\n\nWe were confused. Where did that fantastic looking game from the video go? And after not being able to go to space, or really do anything except experience glitches and a lot of lag, we were just disappointed. Despite all this, we remained excited for future updates. We tried again a few months later. Still the same thing, but with a grass map instead of a desert. About ten months after that we gave it a third shot, and to our surprise, random generation was in, and along with that they also managed to slip in some extra lag. The game was almost impossible to run for more than half an hour, and at this point, we lost hope.\n\nOn the 22nd of September, 2014, Starforge saw it's release, and it was, and still is, absolute mess. All they managed to do with these two years was take the original prototype, and make it worse. The post launch support was minimal, and consisted of four small patches over two months after release.\n\nCodeHatch didn’t even fulfill all their Indiegogo promises, including tiered backer goals. Four people paid 1000$ to “Have a Major Procedural Landmark Named After You (NPC town or base, mountain, landing site) and Become a Legend!” There are no named landmarks. There are no NPCs. The only things you’ll find are the same odd building in every spawn, a small pod here and there, and something that attempts to resemble a crashed ship. The crashed ship is immediately also the only place to “loot”, a feature that CodeHatch proudly displays on the store page. One I didn't see though was "a ton of glitches" mentioned anywhere on neither their campaign page nor the Steam page. There’s a few aliens walking around here and there, but don’t get your hopes up. At most there’s about ten, and all split across biomes so you constantly see the same three creatures sliding across the ground. They drop meat, fiber, and random junk. Said junk can range from guns to armor.. to wooden doors. So do you cook the meat? No, you craft it into an “MR Injector”. MR standing for “Meal Ration”. The fibers you craft into Health Injectors. These two items are all you need to survive. Exciting, I know.\n\nSpace probably sounds like the biggest thing to be exciting about, but is also immediately the biggest disappointment. There’s absolutely nothing to do up there, and the game plays exactly the same as on the ground. How do you get there? Spawn in a space helicopter, or get ready to build a very big block tower. The sky changes colour, there’s some asteroids here and there, and the ground’s a bit further from your feet. No change in gravity, don’t need oxygen, no super tough aliens to fight, and no matter how high up you go, you won’t find anything new. The only things you’ll find here are static asteroids, which have some ore in them, that’s all. Yet, this too is presented as a big selling point.\n\nThe game is incredibely glitchy and boring at best, and highway robbery at worst. CodeHatch is one of the worst game developer teams on Steam, which they displayed a second time with Reign of Kings, which currently also is an absolute mess that they slapped a “version 1.0” on. Do not be fooled into buying anything CodeHatch had their hands on. No matter how fun that gameplay video you watched might make it seem.\n\n\nHere's a short video without commentary displaying bugs.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jws9v0B00s0","January 28","false","6.2"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","31","32","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedEagleLXIX/recommended/227680/","RedEagleLXIX","Red Eagle LXIX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedEagleLXIX/","1899 products in account","A review of what the developer was PAID to do per the Indiegogo (IGG) campaign, their advertising material, and how it compares to the "release".\nThe developer has stated, "Further updates will depend on future sales of the game."\n\nHere are IGG items paid for (reaching 181% of their IGG goal).\nOriginally posted by IGG: Procedural Weapons:StarForge features procedural weapons. This adds a large variety to the weapons you find in the game.These were completely removed from the ability to find in game.  Per the developer they required too much work to balance.\nOriginally posted by IGG: Physics Sandbox:We are designing every object in the world to be fully dynamic. Fell trees in by launching your vehicle on them. Construction, vehicles, players, objects, everything is physically simulated.Some trees fall over only when chopped, and nothing else has real physics applied.  Some trees you can walk right through, can't interact with, and vanish if you dig under them.  So failed to deliver "every object" as fully dynamic and physically simulated, including some trees.\nOriginally posted by IGG: Physics Movement:Our movement model is designed closely around the real biomechanics of biped locomotion; it can simulate jumping, running, climbing, wall jumping, wall running, crawling and pretty much any other behavior all without the use of any state driven code. The result is a more human look and feel, and a character that is equipped to intelligently react to dangers far beyond what conventional movement code was designed to handle. It also features a full body IK system.This feature was almost totally removed when they changed the way the player is animated.\nOriginally posted by IGG: Customizable Characters:We plan on allowing you to cloth and armor your character and change his or her appearance. You are unique and your character should be too.Changing clothes is reflected on character, but there is no customization.\nOriginally posted by IGG: Dynamic World:Creatures will also behave in a realistic matter, scavenge for food and return to their hives at different times of day.Creatures do not behave realistically.  Aggressive creatures just randomly switch to whatever target is closest to them.  There are no hives.  All creatures pop into existence in view of the player.\nOriginally posted by IGG: Single Player::In order to do a proper single player game you need good A.I and lore. We have extremely innovative ideas on improving A.I beyond what you have seen in traditional games, and good things take time to develop.A.I. is virtually non-existent.\n\nNext I'll list the paid for IGG Stretch Goals (IGGSG).\nOriginally posted by IGGSG $100,000 - Liquids & Lava:We will create voxel based water which will be fully dynamic. Lava will also be created. Imagine gaint pools of water which you can manipulate by changing the terrain beneath. You can also flood areas of land. The player will also be able to dive and swim.The water is not dynamic & is not voxel based.  It is a plane and empty space below that level is filled with the liquid you choose (either water or lava).  Thus mining or any other work below the level of that plane is filled with the liquid.  Swimming doesn't require oxygen.\nOriginally posted by IGGSG $125,000 - Dynamic Ecosystem:Many different creatures will roam during the day, and they will mostly be friendly. On top of this, there will plenty of different alien trees and vegetation to discover, each with their own functions and purpose. This will be both an audio and visual experience. However, when the sun is goes down, all manners of foul carnivorous beasts will rise from the depths and try to eat the creatures that live by day.Not in, see "IGG: Dynamic World" above.\n\nThose were the items they were PAID and AGREED to implement but failed on.\n\nTo be clear and fair, only the features above from IGG were paid for, the items below and not above in IGG were potential features or ones that existed & were then removed.  Below only quote parts that differ from the IGG versions.\nFeatures that used to exist but got removed & features advertised but never done from their site & Steam's Early Access page to show they misrepresented the game.\nAdvertising Materials quotes:\nOriginally posted by Heroes and Character Progression:Each player can choose a unique D.N.A pack at the start of their game which will distribute 75 unique skill points across any of these trees at the start of each game. Or they may be able to distribute the 75 skill points themselves.Originally posted by Loot, Level Up, and Survive:As you gain experience you will level up and be able to choose and use new abilities that are unique to each Hero in the game.There is no character progression, no skill trees, and no skills.\nOriginally posted by Procedural Weapons:Infinite weapon possibilities await. Do you fancy a 3 barreled chaingun, with a chainsaw bayonet, and a flame thrower attached for good measure? No matter how many chests you loot, you will never run into the same weapon twice. Weapons are also fully destructible, so another player can try to strategically rip off your gun barrels. Eventually we want to allow the player to build their own weapons as well.Removed, see "IGG: Procedural Weapons" above.\nOriginally posted by Procedural 3D Tileset:We are also working on making it all fully destructible, so you can shoot a rocket and blow a hole in the wall. Each material has its own defense and weight settings as well. You can also enter "Engineering Mode" and properly see the stress points on your building while your building it.No rockets.  No stress points.  Not in, see "IGG: Physics Sandbox" above.\nOriginally posted by Physics Sandbox:Watch as your bridges fall when you remove a support pillar, or your buildings collapse under their own weight and stress. Snap trees in half by launching your vehicle on them. Construction, vehicles, players, ropes, objects, everything is physically simulated.Not in, see "IGG: Physics Sandbox" above.\nOriginally posted by Resources and Economy:When the player can no longer hold what he mined, it will be placed on a palette. These pallets can then be put on transport trucks and shipped to your own warehouses to later be used for crafting. This will keep multiplayer games interesting as players will be forced to build road networks, warehouses, and transport trucks. Plus, they will have to protect it all from players acting as pirates or rival clans. You can also become a trader and try to find merchants to buy your goods at a high price.Palattes, transport trucks, road networks, warehousing were never implemented.  There is a trailer that can be attached to existing vehicles, but no automated transport trucks.\nOriginally posted by Vehicles, Flight, Turrets, Furniture, Fences, ect.:We plan to support a lot of different content. So you can decorate your house, make your fort tough, or build an airstrip and fly a plane to your cloud base.No planes, no airstrips, no cloud bases.  Although you can build on asteroids if you don't mind dealing with the bugs that entails.\nOriginally posted by Multiplayer & SinglePlayer:Enjoy emergant gameplay where you land on the planet, meet other players and NPC survivors, build villages and go to war.No NPC survivors.\nOriginally posted by Fort Wars:a game mode where two teams duke it out in their quest to destroy the opposing team's "vat".Originally posted by Fort Defense:you protect your vat from wave after wave of ravenous alien creatures.Both of these game modes existed and were removed.  They were supposed to be added back but never were.\n\nHere are Some MAJOR bugs that were left in when they raised version numbers and released untested.\n\nBed/Bedroll fails often with player respawn near the spire when logging in or after dying.\nVehicles just randomly vanish from the game when not occupied.\nTerrain morphing & texture flickering is horrendous.\nPlaced objects sometimes sink into the world & vanish.\nBases randomly vanish when returning from long walks or on load.\nSaves corrupting\nCrashes\nMany more in the forums\n\nDo NOT buy.","September 23, 2014","false","12.7"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","33","38","3","15"

I don't know if the end result was intended by the developers or not, but this is just a shame.\n\nEven at $20, this game is just not worth your money, or the time and effort you'll put into exploring it's 'infinitely procedural' world and current features. It seems highly unlikely that CodeHatch will improve this mediocre product beyond what it is, even if enough people are suckered in by the fake trailers and outdated Twitter quotes to fund them. After all, it seems unlikely that more people will pay for the game, and if plenty more do, then why bother improving it? Would seem to sell well enough.\n\nAnyway, I'm hoping this helps my friends more than anything.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Geeknerd1337/recommended/227680/","Geeknerd1337","Jsh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Geeknerd1337/","161 products in account","I am dissappointed by this game. I bought it over a year ago and when it first came out it held a lot of promise. Over the past year I have seen one of the most dishpnest, sleezy, unfair, and downright unethical devcycles. This game is terrible. I mean terrible. It was only greenlit based off of lies and unkept promises. I remember  looking at DayZ the other day. It specifically says not to buy the game unless you want to support the developers. Now DayZ is not a good game at the moment much like starforge, but they SPECIFICALLY RECCOMEND, that you do NOT buy there game unless you REALLY WANT TO.\n\nOne of the things that pisses me off the most is that they go on sale very often. This was a very contriversal issue because people felt like thy were being cheated. Well, they were. All these people care about is making money. They have absolutley no passion for their game. It's all about money with them.\n\nThis game shouldn't even be on steam. What I see now is barely above prototype. This isn't even an alpha. This is a sorry excuse for what early access is. It gives that side of steam really bad rep. There are so many games that actually deserve to be noticed off of early access. It's absolutley sickening that this is even here.\n\n\nADDITIONS AS OF MOST REVENT UPDATE:\nOh my lord, this is what you call 1.0. THIS is what you call 1.0. This is nothing more than a prototype. It's riddled with bugs, has crappy animation, graphics, optimization, progression system, building mechanics, vehicle mechanics, and terrain generation mechanics. This is terrible. Then they made that post about how they're not going to add any of the features that they suckered us wit hin the first place. Where's the leveling syste, the quests, the amazing story? Where is all this stuff that they promised us. Fort wars, tower defense, and all the other amazing features that they falsely advertised. This isn't a good game and I say run for the hills with your money still in your hand because these are not the people who deserve this kind of funding. it's horrid, it's retched and it's no better than Earth: Year 2066. It is its own brand of terrible. I'm not one to constantly rant but: Oh my god are there any compentent people working in this company at all? I fear that this is yet another example set by Early Access games. I'm just... disappointed.\nEarly acces Games you should spend your money on:\n-Starbound: This is pretty much everything starforg promised. Multiple planets, random weapond and npcs, quest system, procedural terrain. Its 2d in the way terraria is but its different from terraria in both artstyle and mechanics\n\n\n-Interstellar Marines: This game doesnt have much right now, but if your really looking for a company to support this is the game to get. The concept is cool the community managers are kind and patient and I don't feel cheated when it goes on sale. It doesnt have much but with every update they've added so far has led them closer to their goal. THey have a lot of passion and it is totally worth it.\n\n-Kerbal Space program: This game isnt for everyone, but its a very interesting sandbox game. If your into the whole nasa space thing you will love this. It's a realistic sandbox game where you build your own ships and go into space. It's a bit difficult but very fun.","December 21, 2013","false","33.5"," 49 of 70 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","49","70","0","5"

I bought into the Founder's Club during Early Access and found myself immediately blown away by Starforge's silky smooth 20 FPS. I was especially amazed to find that enemies would actively hunt me down when my only means of defense in that build, the Drill, ensured that all fights would be lethal for me. The Survival Horror aspect of the game is truly well delivered.\n\nShortly after this, the game was found to be so flawless that Code}{atch had simply disappeared without a trace for three months. We recieved update after update, improving what was already a flawless game exponentially. These updates included restoring Early Alpha mechanics and the implementation of a slower digging tool so you could enjoy gathering materials longer.\n\nWith the announcement of Version 1.0, I am pleased to announce that the game has made even on many of it's promises, such as being a sandbox, or possibly being Sci-Fi themed.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Absolutely. It may be due to my buyer's remorse and my desire to share the joys of a burning money simulator with my fellow consumers, but don't let that stop you, diligent Steam Review reader!\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nMusic: 10/10\nStory: 10/10\nDesign: 10/10\n\nFinal Score: 50/10","October 15, 2014","true","0.6"," 95 of 157 people (61%) found this review helpful 102 people found this review funny","61","95","157","102","5"

I've played both modes (Fort Defense and Survival) enough, but there's really nothing too exciting about it.\n\nFort Defense plays like a very bad version of that fort defense scene in Starship Troopers. You're in a flat endless plain getting attacked by waves of aliens now and then. It has the potential to be a fun defense type map, but it's so limited in both your options and just general gameplay that it's not really fun. You're given very few resources to defend yourself with, and you get random items now and then through these little blue boxes that spawn once per enemy wave. There are a lot of different guns (Carbines, Machine guns, and Chainsaws), but there's no real indication to show that you're doing any meaningful damage with any of them (besides the fact that the Chainsaws kill aliens quickly).\n\nSurvival doesn't really seem like 'survival' just exploration. You begin with a respawn Vat in the middle of a forest and it's up to you to survive. You explore the area around you for blue boxes and hope you get a Chainsaw (to cut down trees for Wood) or you're pretty much doomed from the start.\n\nThe crafting in game is incredibly barebones. You get a blueprint, walk over to your forge, and build things using a slider, provided you have enough materials. It sounds simple when I type it out, but it's way clunkier when you actually try to build things in game.\n\nResource management is also annoying and frustrating. You have a set amount of resources that you carry with you at all times. If you accidentally click on your resources in the inventory screen, they're gone for good. No way to pick them back up, they just disappear.\n\nResource collection is fairly simple, but much too tedious to be actually useful. All of the good resources (Oil, Iron Ore) are far too deep in the ground to be collected in time. They're located 500 meters below surface level, which is roughly 10 minutes of digging straight down, and even then, you might not be able to collect it.Stone and Dirt are readily availble every where, but aren't useful for anything beyond Stone blocks.\n\nConstruction of your fort is one of the big points of the game, but it's just too slow and clunky. It takes a long time to get used to how block placement works in the game, and the indicator isn't very newbie friendly. If you've got the patience to sink a good hour into the game, then maybe.\n\nSpeaking of which, I tried turning on the cheats to see what the game will play like at the end, with full upgrades, maxed resources, etc. It's pretty fun then. You can build a super amazing base with turrets and spot lights, etc. But the game will crash after a while because it's poorly optimized. The longest I've gone is probably about an hour before it just locks up and won't let me do anything.\n\nTL:DR 5/10. Not user friendly, seemingly pointless weapon differences, clunky controls and construction. It's got good potential, but judging from the other players' remarks on the forum and discussion, the game is stuck in development limbo. I highly regret putting so much money into this game at this point.","January 20, 2014","false","5.6"," 47 of 72 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","47","72","0","0"

There are plenty of visual glitches as well. Perhaps this will change over time as patches roll in (this is after all, early access), but thus far there have been no indications of any change in that direction.    Gameplay  3  At its heart, starforge is a crafting/sandbox. It adds a shooter element to the game, albiet painfully. Weapons are wholly unsatisfying to use, and the enemies do not feel threatening at all. The control scheme, particularly when trying to craft, is a painful and unintuitive process. However, the materials you can use to build come together nicely, and building a fort with spotlights/generators, and turrets, does give a rewarding feeling.    Multiplayer  4  Mildly fun with friends, it still is a fairly reptitive, boring experience. You will simply find yourself building, and then screwing around digging because there's not much else to do.    Replayability  2  Honestly, this one is so painful you won't come back for more. Check back again in the future though, as it has some promise.    Overall  3.1/10  This game tries to be good, it really, really does. It's got all the pieces there for it. It just has no idea how to fit them together. From clunky controls, to bothersome animations (or lack thereof), StarForge simply falls short for now. Perhaps one day this could be a good game. But as of right now, save your money, even if it's 5 dollars.\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:  The Tipster","October 7, 2014","false","3.7"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","21","26","2","0"

It still (kinda) does, if anybody would care to add any actual content and fix the plethora of bugs.\n\nI touched this game from time to time throughout it'd development, and each time it got better and better. That all stopped getting better, and then they pulled a rlease launch party? This game is still in alpha. I wouldn't pay more than $2 for the tech demo at this point.\n\nWhat gets to me most about this 'game' is the physics. There doesn't really seem to be any. I was curious about the space heli...so I tried it. It plodded upwards through the air like all the vehicles do (they're all agonizingly SLOW). Sure, there are procedural 'asteroids' up there (look like geometry errors, really). But the gravity doesn't change. Spawn a hovercraft up there and fall back to the planet, and you fall at the same predictable pace the entire way down. It feels like you can run faster than the vehicles move in this 'game'.\n\nI refer to this as a 'game' because there's no gameplay here. Sure, you can collect materials to build stuff. You can even dig holes in the ground. The enemy worms will just tear through whatever you build in a few seconds, but you can build it. All food is done via injections - no cooking. All gear must be crafted, and all the plans have to be found. I hate it when the glowworms eat all the plans from the spaceship. All in all, you can experience almost everything this 'game' has to offer in about 10 minutes.\n\nIf you want an open world survival game that gets it right, play 7 Days to Die; still in alpha, but i've seen betas that are less well developed. Money well spent there.\n\nIf Starforge gets any better, I'll revise my opinion. Until then, I can't help but feel my money was more wasted here than it was on Towns.","October 4, 2014","false","29.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fourhorseman/recommended/227680/","fourhorseman","Four Horseman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fourhorseman/","243 products in account","Well, 1.0 is finally here; I've owned the game for over a year, waiting on the final product.  The dev team has said that future content will depend on how the game sells after it's released.  This is the problem with early access; almost everyone who was interested in the game has already bought it.  The 1.0 release for an EA game is really not a big deal anymore.  Most "fans" have been playing it for months and months, hoping that the final product somewhat resembels the vision put forth at the start of the project.  For Starforge, the answer to this question is a resounding NO.  While there are some aspects to the game that are fun, it still feels as though it's imcomplete.  It is clear that the devs simply decided that they were done working on this POS and wanted to move on to another project.  The game has this huge open world, but there is no reason to explore it; the devs have put all of the ore and resourses in a pie shaped circle, and when starting a new game, your character spawns right in the middle.  Also, being a voxel game it is possible to dig way, way down into the earth; again, the only problem is that there is no reason to.  The Devs have put all of the ore on the surface in huge piles, it kinda looks like God took a huge dump over the planet and forgot to flush. From the start of Starforge people would always talk about how this game has so much potential, and I would agree with them.  However, now that 1.0 is here, it has been made very clear that all of that potential has been wasted.\n\n\nEDIT:  The devs have been banning anyone who voices displeasure with the game; I, along with many people I've known who frequent the forums here on Steam have been banned.  I got the boot for pointing out that if Code Hatch wants to sell any more games they will have to change their name.  The reason for my ban was: Trolling and mis-information.  Well, I hope the devs are proud of the mess they created.","September 19, 2014","false","78.6"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","4"

The developers are not good at this, if something was too tricky for them to figure out they just canned the idea then released the game and called it complete.

Well, they gave singleplayer the option of removing the prisoner field, and added in a few new props in the game.\n\nThat's about it. There are still the same old bugs, the same lack of hyped features, and the same developers that frown upon dissent, even going so far as to lock threads and ban people from the forums instead of addressing concerns like responsible or professional adults.\n\nStill don't recommend the game, still regret gifting it to so many friends.\n\nWith a ~40% positive rating, and that's including old Early Access reviews when people could still honestly give a hopeful review based upon potential, it doesn't look good for future sales of StarForge.\n\nFuture sales, why are they important? Oh, CodeHatch has stated that any future patches for bugfixes or content are dependent upon how much money the game makes. Which is understandable, people gotta eat. Doesn't mean that it's a good risk to take with your money though, especially given the developer's history, both with questionable management of funds and community relations.\n\n\n\nOld Review 6/9/2014:\nWhile full of potential, the game trailers are misleading. The developers have eliminated the open world they promised, and they've also relegated the much celebrated 'customizable' and procedural weapons to the creative mode only.\n\nThe game is definitely improving in terms of playability, but at the cost of what they promised to deliver.\n\nEdit: Okay, they removed the old trailers, and the new one..well..it makes the game look just like Rust in space. Which, it is.\n\nAlso, their claim where you can go in any direction you like for as long as your computer hardware can handle it? A lie. There's a prisoner field in game. The explorable area is capped at 12 miles across, and if you have an nVidia gpu, be prepared for a bunch of terrain issues.

The. Game. WORKS!\n\nHalf the time, and this is after patch 1.0.3, the game will crash immediately when I load my save game. Vehicles we just crafted are disappearing and reappearing in other locations on the map, and sometimes my cousin is getting an entirely different terrain on his screen than mine! This is us running an emulated LAN server over Tunngle (I'm a Lifetime member).\n\nNow, when this game is working, it's not polished or appealing to look at it's physics or visuals (other than the sky, which is gorgeous!), but it's a game that me and my cousin enjoy for simply the ability to travel endless distances both inside and outside the atmosphere.\n\nNow comes the question: Why would the developers put out a "full release" in such a state like this? The game is so poorly optimized I can't even get the game running half the time. Now, if I could get the game to run every time I load it up, I would have a lot more fun. Instead, I'm left frustrated doing everything I can to find a good fix to get our server up again.\n\nI ask, please fix these issues as soon as you can. Put a hault on adding features and polish the game up first. I want to love this game so badly, SO BADLY, but I just need you guys to fix this. This is a game I've come to truly care about it's future. Proove all of these negative reviews wrong and make sure the next update is a knockout!\n\nDo I recommend getting this game now?

You clip through the ground even when just running straight, terran completely changes shape constantly depending on the distance you are, bases completely disappear, the environments look ugly with rainbow colored mountains and sand.  I got banned permanently by Will from the forums for saying the idea of future support based on sales is ridiculious because they OWE it to us to deliver what was promised and how even free to play mods have better support than this. Looks like that talentless scumbag got offended and this just adds further evidence on how they ban everyone who they disagree with. On any thread that people point out the flaws in how the game is being handled Will deletes the thread then bans whoever spoke with even the slightest negativity torwards starforge. They even banned their community manager of 2.5 years plus other employees after they waited until the day their contract ended without even giving them a heads up. These guys are absolute scum and think that can save face by banning everyone who tries bringing the truth to light but it just shows how delusional they really are and thankfully they can't censor the reviews which is why the vast majority of them are negative. Probably the lowest rating game in steam history.  DO NOT SUPPORT THIS GAME EVEN IF IT'S ON SALE THESE DEVS ARE TRASH AND EVERYONE SHOULD CONTACT STEAM TO GET THIS REMOVED.\n\n\nComplete false advertisement. They lured everyone into buying it with a promo video which has things that will never be in the game. All the cool features were removed from lack of funding when they wasted all their kickstarter money on a vacation and hiring expensive bioware devs then had to replace them with fresh out of college noobs a few months later. They even changed the steam store page overnight like scumbags deleting all the innovative features that made people buy the game in the first place. Now they are racing to version 1.0 so they can be done with it and even admitted future support of the game depends on the sales.\n\nCodehatch thought they could hide the truth by banning the whistle blowers on the forums but that doesn't work on the internets. Avoid this scumbag developer at ALL COSTS.\n\nAlso Will and Steve were LUMBERJACKS before they formed codehatch.  They also didn't go to college. This explains a lot. Talentless scumbags.\n\nThis is a must read if you want more info about the scam that is Starforge http://www.destructoid.com/there-s-something-rotten-in-the-state-of-starforge-279901.phtml\n\nTLDR: Mentally handicapped business decisions wasted customers' money which lead to the cutting of the advertised features that would make the game actually good combined with nazi censorship on their forums hoping to keep everyone in the dark.

Then today I noticed that it officially went to 1.0 at some point, so I thought I'd give the completed game a fair shake.\n\nAs it turns out, calling this game "completed" or "1.0" is something of an exaggeration at best, and gross arrogance at worst. the game is nowhere near ready for release: It's still incredibly buggy and unstable, often losing track of the player and teleporting you to some random place, even in singleplayer where lag shouldn't be a factor. I played around for a few hours, and then encountered a glitch of some sort that deleted my entire inventory-- including all my rare minerals and materials, which I had just taken out of my containers and was in the process of crafting with-- and which apparently changed my world's seed in the process. The game then began to freeze me in place every time I moved a few feet ("Generating terrain, please wait...") while the landscape reshaped itself according to the new seed, and swallowed up the little base I had constructed. When I realized everything I had spent the last several hours doing had been obliterated, I decided that I had been more than fair and closed the game.\n\nThat said, some of the game mechanics seem like they could be interesting-- it's minecraft without the cubes and with what appears to be a focus on PVP, though I didn't get far enough up the tech tree to make it worthwhile to try multiplayer.  The UI is very fiddly and difficult to use, but the broad strokes of it are a decent enough design; It just needs a lot of fine detail work.\n\nIt's too bad the game is unplayably buggy, because the "mine things and craft stuff" part of the game is fairly enjoyable, and it's nice to see a minerlike where the focus is on actually defending your little encampment from concerted attack. I'll likely give it a try again in another year or two, supposing a "version 2.0" is forthcoming that makes it more stable.","October 4, 2014","false","5.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

Back then there was a horde survival mode with randomly generated guns but lagged like ♥♥♥♥ after 20 minutes. That mode was the only fun I had in this game. I bought into the game promised with loads of features and things to do. The game is now in full release and I have even less to do than in early alpha. Here are the seven deadly sins of Starforge.\n\n1.The game is an alpha game and always will be. (CodeHatch we might have been able to get over the abrupt switch to beta but seriously full release? Have you even played this game?)\n\n2. Enemies, models, and AI:\nAs described by another review, Starforge ALPHA feels like you are running through a firing range with elephant sized projectiles raining down upon you. You and the enemies bounce all over the place and you can evade an enemy rather easily by making them go through bumpy terrain. There is diversity in the enemy types which can make things interesting. The models for this game are not bad but if one does some research you will find they are all from the Unity store.\n\n3. Vehicles:\nStarforge is home to some of the most pitiful vehicles known to a Atlan colonist. A majority of the vehicles have guns but are not functional which forces you to shoot out of your cockpit potentially damaging your vehicles in the process because of the bumpy terrain. All vehicles except for the fast hovercraft and the helicopter which I have not tried are pretty much useless. The uneven terrain means you will be constantly bumping into things even with a hovercraft and the poor rendering will often make you go careening into a crevass without even knowing it was there until the last second.\n\n4.People who love the game.\nYou are in shock and or are insane. Stop it.\n\n5.Bugs:\nIf you want to see a game full of bugs here it is. The two types of bugs present in this game are very deadly and will either; tear you to shreds, or make your character nearly die but simply running into a wall.\n\n6.The terrain:\nThe worlds in this game actually look rather nice at a distance. It is critical to maintain this distance if you want it to look good. The terrain is very unvenen (Not unlike real life) and is littered with giant spires of oil (Which is not a liquid) and other resources due to the fact it is very hard to find any resources. The only reason they exist is because of players mining for hours and not finding anything but dirt and stone (If you're that lucky).\n\nLast but not least number seven;\nBroken promises:\nWhen I bought this game I was filled optomism for this game's future. As you can see now, that future is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I'm going to list some of the features the devs promised us: Randomly generating guns (Used to have them but now has them ONLY in creative, Progression was another main feature the devs promised us and failed to put in the game for its full release. There was leveling up and other sorts of progression for a short period during alpha and that was fun but has been since removed. NPC's were going to be one of my favorite things in this game. The idea of finding other survivors on Altas and being able to interact with them and helping them build towns and other cool ♥♥♥♥ would have been tons of fun. Codehatch didnt care, they just wanted money. Realistic structures also looked very cool to me and was another main reason this game drew me in. 7 Days to Die hadnt been put on steam when I first started playing this game and it would have been one of the first sandbox games that had structural integrity. Codehatch decided not to includes this for whatever reason.\n\nI could go on for a lot longer explaining to you the flaws of this game but I am getting really worked up right now and my fingers are freezing off.

Things are made to initially look dynamic.. initially feel like its vast.. but in truth all the main elements are in pylons very close to where you start. So within a few hours of play you can build pretty much everything.  Blueprints, and items fall as drops from everything.. but the 'nice' things are found in the hull of the dead ship. That is essentially 3 halls and a small room.  Beyond this ship and the aliens that gather around it.. there is nothing in the world.\n\nNothing to do.. no where to go.. no reason to go if you could.\n\nI expected that every night our fort would be assaulted by increasingly hard monsters until we were wiped out. In truth.. we saw some monsters attack our fort when it was wood.. but our concrete and titanium houses were just not attacked.\n\nThe hovercrafts all pretty much end up on the bottom of the ocean. Every car we have had either could not go over simple things, or became unusable after we exited. Basically the car would hover.. and then shoot off in any direction like the car from Harry Potter. We gave up chasing it.\n\nThe Voxel mining is interesting.. but too often your clipping through walls and staring off into eternity. Unlike Minecraft there is basically nothing under the ground.. no dungeons.. nothing.\n\nFor the first few hours this game had the feel of a grand survival game.. it only takes a few hours though to realize it is a very shallow and incomplete engine that they forgot to develop a game around.","October 7, 2014","false","47.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrtator/recommended/227680/","mrtator","Fortis of Bruma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrtator/","239 products in account","This game is a scifi/survival sandbox where you try and collect resources to either build, kill, or upgrade your current gear. It has two modes, one being a tower-defense reminicent mode. The other being a survival minecraft-style sandox.\nIn the Tower Defense mode, you are given an amount of resources and weapons and are instinctively told to guard the giant glowing beacon. After a set time period you are greeted by a wave of large tusk-worms who try to not only kill you, but your beacon as well. In the sandbox mode you chop trees, mine iron and oil, and try to build a home for yourself amongst the strange, and sometimes hostile, creatures inhabiting the planet. Graphics-wise, I'd give this game a 5/10. It has a decent view, but lacks in the way of vegetation, biome structures, and loves putting mountains as an arbitrary map border with rapid slope changes. On the side of texture, they are acceptable when it comes to most things. The only problem I have is the first person hands, as they look like they're actually made of stone with skin colors. For Gameplay, I'd give it another 5/10. I can appreciate the idea of survival and staking your claim, I, myself, enjoy these games greatly, and when it comes to the actual building, it is rather fun. But the finding of resources can be a trip to hell. Some ores are colored brightly, as to make them visible from a distance, but most are the same color as the stone terrain, which comes in many colors. So finding that iron vein can be like pulling teeth if your eyes aren't trained to the exact hues. Plus the game has a very unruly physics system. Swimming not only looks weird, but is done at snail speed. (Tip: Don't press space and forward at the same time. You won't go anywhere) When climbing a mountain, and you gain too much momentum downward, you may find your body at the bottom really easily, as there is no stopping. Creatures also roll on steap hills like it was going out of style. Bugs can be a players worst nightmare., and this game is no exception. I personally have had my share of insta-kills from monsters while with full health & armor, and loss of items do to the box containing my items on death disappearing all too quickly. But if your able to get past the bugs and know your ore supply location, you can enjoy all that building has to offer. Which can definitly give you that sense of accomplishment that comes from these type of games. When it comes to buying it, it's definitly a toss up. The Tower-Defense mode can give you a few hours of fun, more so with friends, and the sandbox mode can be enjoyable if you get past the previously addressed issues. If you plan to play solo, keep in mind that it may very well be a painful grind. If you play multiplayer, you'll find it less so, but still, depending on the map luck. I personally have played enough games of the same style/genre that I would not buy this again if I were given the chance, as it is very similar to the others, with few differences.","October 26, 2014","false","17.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"Infinite terrain" crashes your game more often than not, and even outside of the main starting area there are no resources of any kind. All resource nodes and biome nodes are in the same spot EVERY WORLD, meaning that it looks different, but in reality is basically the same. Vehicle are terrible. They control bad and the Space Copter is just a buggy, slow elevator that controls terribly.\n\nThere are many, many more things, like them banning users for saying the game is bad, or blatantly lying in the early promo videos.

A special physics treatment was planned, at least in my understanding, which should offer the possibility for structures to break down under certain conditions. Unfortunately this feature was not completed.\n\nWithout this unique feature, I'd rather recommend Planet Explorers than Starforge.\nIt is based on the same principles, includes NPCs, Quests, and much much much more content on the yet still early access state.\n\nI hope for future updates for Starforge to increase the content and possibly add additional features, since I bought 4 copies of the game for my friends and myself.","November 1, 2014","false","17.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Perhaps they didn't want to deal with angry customers seeing basically nothing for their money over several years of development, or maybe they just didn't want deal with bugfixing. Regardless, StarForge is the farthest thing from complete.\n\nWhile the core (and I mean VERY core) mechanics are solid, the world itself has nothing to offer, with only about 4 unique monsters, no tutorial (iirc the devs said they'd put out one after release, which is a problem in itself), and unnecessarily boring and repetitive game advancement. The game's multiplayer is scattershot at best, mainly due to their horrible terrain caching system.\n\nLike most games, the polygon count/textures of terrain become lower as you move away, because it saves on data usage. However, StarForge's system is depressingly bad, as it takes incredibly long to unpack the terrain as you approach it. Their solution to this is to freeze the player in place (which doesn't actually pause the game, I should add, it only makes you completely vunerable) and say "loading terrain..." This isn't a situation where you teleport forward 3 miles and the game has to catch up, I'm talking about walking from your house to your shed.\n\nStarForge is another Early Access game that took advantage of the system still being young, and produced a sub-game that isn't nearly complete. It's an unattractive trend that's been too prevalent as of late.","September 30, 2014","false","14.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Grafika- Dala by se srovnat se Starwars Galaxies což je cca 6let stará hra(mimochodem skvělá hra),mírně mixnutá vzdálenou krajinou z Gothic3(tedy vidíte v dáli rozmázlé prd),což je v roce 2014 více než k pláči,jde to vysvětlit snad jen tak, že tvůrci hry si místo investování vydělaných peněz do vylepšení kvality hry,užívali kvalitně strávený čas, z některou s rádoby modelek Playboy magazínu .    2.Ovládání-Jedním slovem hrozné,hlavně je to patrné při ovládání vozidel kdy vaše automatická převodovka se nemůže rozhodnout jestli při zmáčknutí W zařadit jedničku nebo zpátečku.    3. Fyzika-Neexistuje,tedy ona existuje ale je tak arkádová že vlastně neexistuje(tady bych rád napsal ¨lol¨ ale nějak mi to nejde).    4.Zvuk-Hmm,tak tady bych použil s dovolením vaši obrazotvornost,představte si nádherné zelené udolí na míle se táhnoucí v dáli,po stěnách padající vodopády nad nimi se klenoucí vodní tříšť,na dně udolí se táhne klikatící se silnice s uježděné země,po ní se řítí terénní vozidlo,v tom vozidle je spolujezdec ,co si elektrickým zubním kartáčkem právě čistí zuby,a to je ten zvuk co autoři hry použili v mírných obměnách pro všechna vozidla ve hře.   5.Shrnutí-Editor je možná fajn,ale z mých prvotních předešlých zkušeností s hrou si na něj v rámci duševního zdraví nechám zajít chuť,útěchou mi budiž to, že jsem hru koupil ve výrazné slevě avšak i za těch 6 euro bych si nejraději na♥♥♥♥oval(vrazil si opakovaně dlaní do tváře).Koupit hru za plných cca. 20 éček bych si asi vyrazil zuby.Nakonec,abych to zakončil alespoň nějak pozitivně,bych rád vyjjádřil svou naději, že vývojáři vytáhnou obličeje s krajkového orámování dekoltu svých asistentek a dají se konečně do práce,aby už k cestě domů nemuseli využívat místo metra,městskou kanalizaci.\n\nEnglish ver.(Google Transl.powered):Well, somehow I do not know what to make of this game think.So my first impressions after switching game: 1. Graphic- One might compare the\nStarwars Galaxies which is about 6 years old game (great game by the way), slightly mixing remote countryside of Gothic3 ( so you can see in the distance blurry fart), which in 2014 more than cry, it's going to explain perhaps the only way that the creators of the game, instead off investing money earned to improve the quality of the game, enjoying quality time taken from one of the wannabe models of the Playboy magazine . 2.Control- One word-awful, especially when it is apparent control of vehicles, when your automatic transmission can not decide if pressed when W first gear or reverse. 3.Physics- Not exist,so it's exist but is so arcade that does not actually exist (here I would be like to write lol but somehow I do not). 4.Sound-Umm, so here I used with the permission of your imagination, imagine the magnificent green valley stretching for miles in the distance, the walls falling waterfalls above them, arching spray on the bottom of the valley stretches meandering roads with compacted ground, after rushing the off-road vehicle, in the vehicle's passenger, what precisely electric toothbrush cleans the teeth, and it is the sound of what the authors used the game in slight variations for all vehicles in the game. 5.Summary-Game editor is maybe good, but from my primary previous experience with the game on him under the my own mental health let go taste. The consolation for me is that, I bought this game at huge discounts but also for those six euros'd prefer to repeatedly slammed hand into the face myself .When i bought full game for approx. 20e stuff I probably leave my teeth.At the end of it to at least somehow ended positively, I would like express my hope that the developers pull the face with lace neckline framing her assistants,and finally put to work, able to travel home did use the subway instead city ​​sewer.","August 10, 2014","false","0.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"

I've benchmarked graphically and mechanically better games that didn't suck half as much memory. Furthermore after running several tests using this new desktop, I can safely say Starforge used more processing power from my CPU and video card, caused rapid gains in heat, and stress more stress on the system.. then running Tomb Raider, Arkham Asylum, Planetside 2, and Final Fantasy XIV on max settings.\n\nSo, in short.

Inexplicable physics, awkward controls and building mechanics, and no goal or purpose in gameplay as of yet. I understand this is in an alpha state and is early-access, a regrettable trend that is increasing throughtout the steam marketplace. These games are unfinished and come from inexperienced teams who are attempting the creation of products that are entirely unique. Starforge is no different. However, though we have not yet seen this come to pass, it is highly likely that a large portion of these games will not achieve what the claim they will achieve, experienced game devs will tell you eventually concepts are left to the cutting room floor. You are purchasing a game that is not a finished product and expecting gold in the long term. I do not forsee Starforge becoming anything more substantial than an awkward minecraft clone. Im hoping to be proved wrong and I agree that my judgement comes from an unfinished product, but I for one believe game devs should finish their damn games before they try to get money from them.

After playing in this world for 5 hours I realized that I had been spawned in a manner which did not have any creeps or other means of gaining blueprints. Upon starting a new game, all was well.\n\nWithin this new game I quickly learned what I was doing and quite enjoyed myself. Suddenly, however, my base disappeared... and I lost a LOT of stuff (I'm a hoarder.)  There was also an issue with the framerate dropping from ~45 to about 7, which made it difficult to play.\n\nOverall, when it functions, the game is fun. Even so, there is much left that needs to be done before it is good for more than ~20 hrs of building/ mining. Although the outlook is grim at the moment, I personally will hold on and hope the devs continue to add features to make the game more exciting and continue debugging (for heaven's sake.)\n\nAt this time, I wouldn't recommend this based upon the amount of frustration that comes from the glitches. As soon as the game is actually stable, absolutely.","October 27, 2014","false","23.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I'm patient. I don't know for sure, but I think the game was in alpha. Sure played like an alpha.\n\nI was still waiting for updates to bring it up to beta quality when I was surprised to learn it actually released.\n\nI understand the risks associated with buying an early access game, but seriously. I know things can change, things may not happen, but I personally don't think that extends to this whole "We're only going to finish the game (it is not finished despite being "released") if more people keep buying our 'game'." attitude that's happening right now. As a developer, you should know what you're getting into and plan your finances accordingly. You don't spit in the faces of the people funding you. Accidents happen, personal real life issues happen, maybe the game just never comes together like you forsaw, those are the risks I expect. Incompetence is not a risk, it's just plain unacceptable.\n\nSo, basically, even though it means the game will never be finished and I won't get what I personally paid for, I DO NOT recommend this game.

I was drawn to the concept of a 3d crafting game with RPG  and FPS elements. You can still read Code}{atch's second blog post on 02/19/2012 illustrating their first character: The Shooter. They show a broad skillset with 25 skills over 4 Skill Trees and 7 starting attributes. This tree obviously would have been updated to some extent, but this showed incredible potential and looked like tons of fun.\n\nThere were always early warning signs that this game was going to be rushed out. The updates came every 1-2 months and were fair but nothing huge. The first update that actually turned StarForge into a playable survival game was released in December 2013 but it still needed an enormous amount of work. When the game went to Beta in June 2014, I was disappointed because there was still so much work left to do and it really seemed like this small team of developers was rushing their product.\n\nThe release was fun to play for a few hours, but with no real progression outside of finding new blueprints (you find too many duplicate blueprints) and building new bases, the game becomes boring quickly. The inability to simply remove old blocks is disappointing–it adds a tedious amount of time to a game which centers around base construction. Placing objects which stand like the forge is difficult because they frequently end up on their side or leaning off-kilter which is visually frustrating.\n\nOverall, this game is mediocre and as such, I cannot recommend a purchase at this time. If Code}{atch does patch the game with new features, I'll amend my review. I don't really feel ripped off–again, I bought at a discount what amounted to an unfinished tech demo–but I do feel disappointed. I honestly hope someone is inspired by what StarForge wanted to be and succeeds in creating the best RPG/FPS/Crafting fusion the world has ever seen.","October 4, 2014","false","15.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The physcis are good outside of the character movement but I'll be damned if any pc can run it as it takes alot of power to run it fully without constant framerate drops. The controls are awkward with your character acting more like a marionette then a normal person. In short its just not finished and the team stopped it due to there budget, but this is just another example why  people should wait and not buy the alpha's, I was guilty of this and waited 2 years for it to be fully done and the development has sadly stopped and it is now left in a poor state.","September 30, 2014","false","33.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It looked to be the perfect intersection of Terraria, Minecraft, and Halo. However, it is not nearly complete enough to be any of those.\n\nFirst, the good aspects:\n\n-There are lots of resources to find and obtain, and the recipes for various objects generally make sense.\n-All the objects and creatures have excellent detailed meshes.\n-The leeches (one of the hostile mobs) hunt down and kill the passive mobs, which adds some life to the ecosystem.\n\nNow for the bad:\n-The voxel terrain, one of the main features of the game, is still buggy and lags atrociously as new voxels are loaded far away, and closer voxels are refined.\n-The player character slips and slides on even slightly angled terrain as if there was very little friction.\n-The new water plane is nice and all, but you can't actually manipulate the water itself.\n-All the resources can be found in large piles on the surface, so mining underground isn't actually necessary.\n-Blueprints (object recipes) occur *completely* randomly, either as a drop from mobs or in boxes in the crashed starship region.

Shortly after my purchase I disappointingly uninstalled the trashy mess, wondering to myself how the devs even got the footage for their teaser.\n\nAlmost two-ish years later, I decided to give the game another chance, and much to my suprise nothing had been fixed, nothing significant had been added, and the game still looks nothing like what was promised (and the trailer still shows things that the game itself doesn't have).\n\nYou spawn randomly, resources don't have any rarity or order, the crafting system is beyond confusing and feels forced/jagged, the guns are unbalanced with an unrealistic/unsatisfying recoil,  what you build is VERY likely to vanish by the time you play again (if not, have fun finding it (even bigger pain if you build underground)), the landscape has a buggy load time that destroys the gameplay, it's poorly optimized with weird frame drops through-out,  AND THE DEVS are moving OUT of "Alpha" because they FEEL that it's ready. When it all reality, the game is still unplayable. When asked what they have to say about it, there's nothing but silence.\n\nThis is one of those rare titles that I regret buying, and almost consider a scam.\nIt's right up there with games like; "Day One : Garry's Incident" or "DayZ" (before new patches)\nExcept for the fact that those Early Acess titles seem to be actually trying to fix their mess.\n\nThis team of devs obviously took on more than they could handle.\n\nDon't trust my review?\n\nGo look at the "Top Rated Reviews of all Time",\nand be shocked at the massive amounts of negative feedback.\n\nThe community has spoken!","September 20, 2014","false","3.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

And probably you will become deaf because audio settings doesn't seem to work, so you will listen to all that disgusting repeating sounds with the maximal volume.\nI've seen a few games that was looking promising on the alpha stage, but StarForge is definitely not that kind. It has slow and ugly game interface (that pisses off in Defence mode when you need to forge items as fast as possible, and instead of that you need to see every menu opening and closing animation which is almost second long). Forging process and inventory looks just idiotic. Guess what do you need to do to forge more that one item? Shift+click? Nope. Mouse wheel? Nope.

This was a great concept for a game, and a lot of fun to play as it progressed. However Codehatch fired all the programmers and released an unfinished product as a finished game. The single player doesn't have enough content to keep playing for more than a couple days, and the multiplayer doesn't even save bases so there's no point in playing it.\n\nThis game is a prime example of a developer that took all the money and ran. They still are releasing "patches," but they don't help anything. Honestly, this game is dead. I wouldn't recommend anyone waste their money on an unfinished project. Hopefully Valve/Steam will take note of all the comments and remove the game from their store soon.

I loved the ideas behind this game and what they said they were going to do with it. It would make me so happy to recommend this game to everyone BUT I cannot. The developers of this game released it way too early. It doesn't play well and lacks game mechanics.\n\nWhen I found out about this game I looked for more information. I found the Indiegogo campaign and this trailer (http://www.gamereactor.eu/grtv/?id=69331). They raised the funds they asked for it was only a few months old so I was sold. Cool gun generation, great idea for a power system, team survival and fortress defense, and the building with actual physics (this caused me to go buy it right then and there). Oh, and all the spaceships that would make getting around the planet fast and fun.\n\nWhen I bought the game it had basically none of this but I was fine with it. I waited. I played half an hour here, an hour there, when new updates came out. I didn't see much of what they had shown in the trailer but I kept quiet, waiting and hoping.\n\nThen the game released to my surprise. I had been busy with college and work so I had not been updating the game or following development. I was so excited. Finally, i thought, I can play the game that they had shown me over a year ago. I did a fresh install and finally got into the game (I live in a remote area so my internet connection is crap, meaning it takes hours to download things).\n\nWhat I got was not what I expected; was not what I was given in the trailer. Some of it was there, the world generation and the running physics but what about the rest?\n\nI paid the developers to help with the project that had already been fully funded on indegogo. At the time I was not expecting a finished product, I knew that it was early alpha and I knew I would have to wait. I waited patiently. I paid so that when the finished product was out I could play it. I believe that the finished product is not finished at all and furthermore it was not the product I had been shown.\n\nI really feel that I wasted the $10 I spent which I am unhappy about.\n\nIf updates change this I will change my stance but as it has released to too many negative reviews I doubt this will happen.","November 8, 2014","false","5.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I checked on it often, played with friends, read the development blog. There are a lot of things about this game that I think are great, really fantastic. Having said that though it's just not a full game at all. There are a ton of problems with the design of the game and several with the programming. The important thing is though that even if they fixed those there just isn't enough here. No real goals, not enough content to truly feel like you're exploring (more like wandering).\n\nThe earlier builds had some really cool concepts that ended up scrapped and honestly if feels like the developers just gave up halfway through (I honestly do think they at least got halfway). I waited a while to review it because I was hoping they'd keep developing it past release but it's pretty clear now they're just done. As it is I can't recommend it at any price even if you just want to look at the visuals (which are interesting if not amazing). This game makes me doubt early access and crowdfunded games, I'm really sad about that.","October 28, 2014","false","8.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is incomplete and will only provide about 2 hours of game play.  CodeHatch had an ambitious project and used crowdfunding to raise money to build what is sadly their "final release".  If you are looking for something more playable, try Planet Explorers, they are doing the crowdfunding and development properly.\n\nThe concepts first presented were truly ambitious and would have made for an extremely interesting game.  CodeHatch failed to deliver on those initial ambitions.  What they "released" is not playable on many of their own servers, contains many bugs that will kill you (disappearing space copter, exiting a buggy will fling the buggy into the air and pulverize you, driving a hovercraft and it disappears as you're flying across country - now you're thousands of meters away from your base and have to walk back).  These are only a few of the bugs, your entire base is subject to disappearing, your containers will magically empty or disappear completely, the list goes on.\n\nIf you're looking for mining/fighting try Planet Explorers or any other game.  I hoped this game would be awesome and invested in the Founders Club early on, unfortunately I have to say - this is a do not buy.","October 28, 2014","false","125.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The producers didnt make a game, they made a cashgrab-scam.\n\nNearily 80% of the features that were to originally feature on the game haven't even made it onto the final version, leaving many many people ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe game lags to hell when you build a base with any amount of machines in it, lagging you to the point that it's unplayable on moderate computers. This 'game' (more in line with a scam) is full of broken promises, like...\n\na FUNCTIONING parkour system (rather than your character just flailing around when you jump high enough, or whatever),\n\nVehicles that aren't bugged into uselessness (they control like a horse on crack) and completely defenceless,\n\ncomplex construction (stress, basic physics, no floating blocks, etc)\n\nsupposedly a power system involving lasers to keep machines running\n\na system of capable enemies (Crap AI, hardly a threat as they spawn scattered evenly in the landscape around you)\n\n'randomly generated guns' (beyond the creative mode); a series of uninspired weapons have replaced them in 'survival.'\n\na complete lack of gameplay; no real urge to explore at all beyond a (to my opinion, anyways) blueprint system.\n\nbroken mining; when you dig deep enough, you will eventually hit the water level regardless of where you are. If you have the water set to lava, well... GG.\n\ngameplay has actually appeared to DEGRADE over time, as more stuff seemed to be taken out than introduced.\n\nincredibly bland landscape; (not to mention illogical design; A desert next to a tiaga forest) there is absolutely no reason to even climb a mountain, as there's nothing there. Just lots of rock. Oceans are just as bad, except you move slower, and there aren't any mobs at all.\n\nBut, there are a few redeeming factors.\nThe game has a seemingly infinite terrain, which is incredibly hard to program. The game had a huge potential to become something epic, but ofcourse, it failed.  There are just about no other good things that I can say about this game, since it might as well be a tech demo.\n\nLesson of the day- er...

Not fun when they can kill you if in an enclosed space.\n3) Terrain still glitches causing you to get stuck or random areas not being able to be mined.\n4) Blast charges (that you place on obstacles) will glitch repeatedly and just simply disappear when trying to blow things up making it impossible to deconstruct doors/garage doors when you are ready to upgrade them.\n5) In space and again, no spawn anchor. Creatures spawn mid air in space around asteroids and just simply fall to their deaths, spawn, fall to their deaths, spawn.....\n6) Passive creatures (the ones that run away from you) go out of their way to destroy your vehicles. Park a vehicle anywhere close to a resource for any length of time and it'll be destroyed. Its either a bug or dev trolling.\n\nIn other words, it's a mess.

There are just about no other good things that I can say about this game, since it might as well be a tech demo.\n\nLesson of the day- er...

HOW WRONG I WAS!!!!!!!!\n\nI bought the game at very early alpha(2years ago) the game was terrible to the point of being unplayable had very few features and very ugly graphics but this was only an alpha and the dev video promised that the game would be so much more so I left it in my steam library occasionally checking to see what they had added to the game.\n\nAfter 6 months  of very little content being added I gave up on the game and just forgot about it very dissappointed in all the empty promises the devs had made.\n\nAbout a year later I noticed that the game had entered its Beta stage and for the first time it actually had some noticable changes I began to get excited about the game once again thinking I had just been too impatient,that developing the game takes much longer than I expected and that now the game had entered its Beta stage changes would be more recognisable.......SHAME ON ME !!!!!\n\nabout another 6 months later I learn that the game is in its finished state with almost next to nothing that I felt the devs promised the game would be 2 years ago when they convinced me to stupidly support them and buy thier ♥♥♥♥ poor excuse for a game.\n\nThis was the first early access game I ever bought. My experience with Starforge NEARLY put me off supporting any other early access games ever again as the experience was just one massive dissappointment. However I have purchased several other early accsess games and am happy with how things are progressing with them particularly The FOREST great devs that always have something new for me to look forward 16days after every patch. The devs of The FOREST have proven it is possible to give a good early access experience and are the main reason I continue to purchase games in early access but sadly no amount of games like The FOREST will be able to remove the bitter taste that starforge has left in my early access experience.\n\nSo please even though STARFORGE was a train wreck of an early access title don't let it stop you from supporting anyother Early access titles as they are not all like this and some developers do actually deliver on their promises.","September 30, 2014","false","1.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hotfoot/recommended/227680/","hotfoot","Hotfoot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hotfoot/","432 products in account","What I spent on it: $18.74 (Founders Edition Early Access on Steam Sale)\n\nWas it worth it? Purely on time for money standards, the answer would be yes. I've logged 34 hours on this game so far, and for having spent less than 20 bucks for the super edition that's no longer available, that's not too bad. However, pure time for money standards are not the only metric for games, because the quality of that time has to be considered as well. Ultimately, I can't say that I would recommend this game beyond that of a $5 novelty title, and even then only barely.\n\nOverview\n\nStarForge is one of many Minecraft clones that hit the market once Minecraft exploded a few years ago. One of Minecraft's greatest flaws was its graphics. In this day and age with games like Watch_Dogs spoiling players with great graphics even when limited by the company (and phenomenal graphics after the fan patch) or simply flat out gorgeous games from basically every angle, the blocky giant pixels of Minecraft weren't delightfully retro for everyone, they were visually offensive. I'm not in that camp, but I do like better graphics when they are available. Enter StarForge. I've often referred to games like this as "Pretty Minecraft" because, well, that's what they are. Minecraft, but with better graphics. The terrain is deformed more naturally when you mine, the world overall looks nicer, and so on. It all sounds great.\n\nThe premise of the game is that you're a prisoner on a planet where things have gone wrong. Beyond that, there's really not much story there. In your starting area there are spires that collect resources and blueprints while you play, a crashed starship leaking radiation and surrounded by monsters that you can delve into for precious blueprints, and some giant spire thing with a drill at the end I've not yet figured out.\n\nYou start with meager supplies, a speedo, and a slow jackhammer that doubles as your first melee weapon and resource collector, plus a few essentials and a handful of recipes to make better things. From there, you must survive. Find food, kill monsters, and build your structure for survival. There's also multiplayer, which I barely played.\n\nThe game released this month, much to my surprise, because when I was playing it still felt like an early Beta with a lot of work to do. This isn't helped by the fact that a lot of features were promised back in the early days, complete with video of them working.\n\nPros:\n\n-The graphics, while not AAA gorgeous, are light-years ahead of minecraft. The world looks sufficiently pretty to make people happy, and some of the monsters look pretty creative.\n\n-Since the release, framerates have very much improved across the board, but even on my system, there are times it drops down to below the dreaded 30fps barrier.\n\n-Building structures and throwing together defenses can be a good amount of fun, what with the auto turrets and the like.\n\n-The world is pretty big.\n\nCons:\n\n-Progression is very poorly handled. A lot of these games try to have gear progression, and many of them fail to have it in any meaningful fashion. In Minecraft, it's simple. You need higher quality materials to collect the next sets of resources, which then can be used to make higher quality equipment. Since this stuff all breaks sooner or later, you save the higher-end stuff for when you NEED it, since the materials to make it are shockingly rare most of the time. This game, you leapfrog quite easily from the worst gear in the game to the best inside of an hour. All the materials you need are usually within a 2 kilometer radius of your starting point, above ground or on the surface, easily collected as soon as you have the better drills, which should be pretty quick. In Minecraft, as soon as you have the resources for something and can figure out how to build it, you've got it. Here, you're limited by blueprints. Which drop randomly. From everything. Kill a space-rabbit? Get a blueprint. Open a box? Get a blueprint. Kill a Klendathu Bug? Get a blueprint. Not just that, but they could literally have anything at all on them. Doors, guns, full sets of armor, stairs, actual antimatter, you name it! There's no logic to it and the whole thing feels like a beta test workaround to test the random loot generator. I await the day I find a space helicopter inside of those cat-sized bugs.\n\n-Building is difficult. You can only undo the last 5 block placements you do, so if you mismeasure, you're screwed. Until you get explosives, but those are incredibly costly to make and if you're building a bomb-proof bunker, you need the biggest ones. There are techniques to make it easier, but if you find out you need to do an expansion, you're pretty much just out of luck. The game also has a "weathering" effect that randomly deletes blocks placed in the wild, meaning you need a special tool (you start with one) to keep the game from erasing your structures. Of course, if you decide you want to move and pack it up, the place you put it last still counts as protected, even if you never deploy it again. This is just more lazy code that, one would think, would be an easy fix. Also, some of the blocks, like wood and iron, have random doodads that get added on when you place them, even if you don't want them. None of the other blocks seem to, though most of the blocks are too difficult to create in the large numbers you need for base construction.\n\n-Multiplayer has a lot of toys dedicated to it. There's a lot of stuff in the game that seems dedicated to multiplayer. Smoke grenades, EMPs, hacking devices, Radar Towers, the works. Of course, using various abuses in the system, multiplayer is all about floating gun turrets and bases unconnected to the ground. Because why model gravity to your blocks? At all?\n\n-Similarly, the only source of water in the game seems to be in the form of ice or cacti you can find in the desert. Gone is the oddly flowing water of Minecraft, in fact, gone is water almost entirely. It's pretty, but we can clearly see the divide between pretty games and functional ones.\n\n-Because everything you need is above ground, there's really no reason to go delving into caves, even when they appear. In fact, due to the Random Number Generator determining what blueprints you get, your best bet is setting up camp near the starship and the loot collectors, regularly farming them for the blueprints you need to build the next cool thing, like a vehicle or a turret, or whatever.\n\n-Movement is sometimes wonky as hell. The number of times my guy started sliding down stairs because of the bizarre movement model was just unnerving.\n\n-There are only a handful of creatures in this game, and the apex predator which strongly resembles the Bugs from Starship Troopers are rendered basically harmless within a few hours of play.\n\n-Dying means you respawn either at your base where you last slept, or back at your original spawn. Like with Minecraft, your stuff stays by your previous corpse for a time, so you can potentially retrieve it. Unlocked blueprints, mercifully, remain. However, during the beta I had an instance wherein I died due to a bug, then died about seven times in a row on my respawn and all my things were gone. In the launched game, it's still entirely possible to die thanks to a bug or glitch, and they are plentiful, and that means say goodbye to all your stuff, unless you dropped stuff off at your based.\n\n(Due to text limitations, the rest of the review is in the comments)","September 29, 2014","false","35.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","4"

If it didn't have 1.0 as the version number, I wouldn't have been able to tell. I purchased it on sale during early access and at the time I thought it had a lot of potential. Some of the ideas and mechanics they pitched in their initial trailer were a bit silly, of course you won’t be able to do free running, and building into space is entirely unreasonable for a project of this scale, but the basic idea of mixing a survival/crafting game with a modern sci-fi FPS is a very good one. Unfortunately, if I'm being brutally honest, the game has actually gotten worse since I first played it. It somehow looks and plays worse than it did 6 months ago. I don't really know what else to say. I can't really even review the gameplay with much depth because the graphics and rendering are so broken that I can't really even play it. What I’ve seen fails to impress nonetheless.\n\nThere’s very little progression to the game. In your standard crafting survival game there’s a progression to the technologies and resources the player has available to them. As you play the game and gather more materials you gain access to new technologies, which in turn give you access to new areas and new aspects of gameplay. While Starforge does follow this basic framework to some extent, there’s really not much to it. There’s very little to discover and very few technologies to develop, many of which are just downright silly; you don’t have to be an aeronautical engineer to know that you can’t fly a helicopter in space. There’s not much of a difference between the different vehicles, and most of the different building materials are little more than different textures. If they weren’t going to do anything with the different assets, they why even bother creating them?\n\nI really wanted this to be good, and I was even cautiously optimistic that these guys might pull off something really special, but I guess not. I guess it’s possible that it could be fixed overtime, but considering that the current state of the game would be the alpha phase for most, I’m not holding my breath. Calling this a full release is insulting. Buying this game at any stage of development thus far has been a total waste. It’s a waste of money, it’s a waste of time, it’s a waste of promising concept for a game, and it’s a waste of space (pun intended). In short, Starforge is a waste and an embarrassment that you should not buy for any price.","October 27, 2014","false","3.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Key word, LOVED. THe idea, the concept, the visual aspect of the game, I absolutely love/loved it. But the game is seriosuly undermined by devs whom really wanted to make a quick buck. A game that is still considered Alpha by 95% of the community is considered full release by the devs. Servers are ♥♥♥♥. There is not enough content to support the game. The game is unstable, full of bugs ( i have no issues with bugs, but I have issues with a game being deemed official release and having as many bugs in this )\n\nNow the Devs have released a new game called Reign of Kings, which is getting alot of good reviews. But you want to know why I will not be buying RoK? It is for the one simple reason of, they still have an incomplete game, that they have completely shoved aside. DayZ Standalone was more complete upon its release in 2013 than this game currently is and the fact that SF is still up for sale with all of the negative reviews that it has received is completely shocking.\n\nThis game had a lot of potential. The scifi version of Rust Legacy with Halo Reach style graphics? YES PLEASE.\n\nI was following this game sense it was mentioned on Greenlight back in 2012 and I know many people were stoked about this game, with its survival style, to its castle defender game type, etc. But in the end, we barely have a game that can be barely played in single player.\n\n\nEnd result, while I hate giving games a bad review, I must say, please save your money, for this game was more of a let down than Bungie's Destiny.","October 8, 2014","false","21.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I gave it 5-10 minutes of attention at the time before realizing I had basically done all there was to do- walk, place some blocks, shoot a gun.\n\nSo I gave it some time. Most games simply need time to get off the ground, and funding from early access can help greatly with this. So upon release, I tried it again. Unfortunately, it feels like these devs decided to take the money and run, because in its current state, a FULLY RELEASED state, it feels empty and incomplete. It's buggy and, quite simply, unacceptable.\n\nI had hopes that maybe when this game was fully released, it'd actually be pretty good, something I might want to sink some time into. I have sadly been mistaken.\n\nTo put it simply- don't waste your money.","October 31, 2014","false","1.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/senshado/recommended/227680/","senshado","Homework Chavez - 70% finished","http://steamcommunity.com/id/senshado/","187 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAs requested, I will review Starforge.\n\n...by which I mean the works in progress.\n\n...and by that I mean the most recent one.\n\nI will not try to directly attack Code}{atch nor will I grant any credit where it's not deserved.\n\nThough it seems like a stretch - from the beginning of my ownership all the way up to this point - Starforge has so far taken the shape of two games. From what I understand from the community this number might not be accurate when you regard this game's entire lifespan so far. When I bought Starforge it was more or less a stable tech demo that, probably unintentionally, had an emphasis on experimentation. The player could battle unlimited waves of aliens trying to destroy your spawnpoint, with the help of random generated weapons (like octa-chainsaws and quad-minigun-dual-autocannon-triple-sugmachinegun with scope) and building blocks this mode could keep the average player's attention for 30 minutes at best. On top of that there also was a creative game mode with a pretty mysterious map featuring some bugs, unlimited resources to build with, and a breathtaking night sky.\n\nHowever, this changed in December 2013. While the previous state of the game was rather shallow and limited to just the aforementioned, by many it was considered a tech demo that fuelled anticipation for the final game. The promised features seemed to hit the spot: plenty of alien flora and fauna, procedurally generated maps, vehicles, and the list goes on. Some of these features have been implemented on this particular date, though a lot of players would argue they didn't get what they expected. More about that later.\n\nThe proposed concept of Starforge is that of a survival game taking place on Atlas, an exoplanet in a far away galaxy. The player is part of (or - depending on the player count - just 'the') the first colonist(s) in charge of making sure the planet is suitable for human life. By gathering resources with a set of special tools you should be capable of establishing a base of operations around your spawnpoint - a clone vat to be more specific - which includes a power source and automated defense systems to keep aliens out.\n\nA second proposed gamemode is the already mentioned more fast paced action where the player and his team (you'll need one) is dropped in the middle of nowhere with a single clone vat to protect from waves of hostile aliens. Randomly spawned resources make it so the team can build walls to keep the aliens out, though this can't be kept up if the players themselves don't motivate the aliens to stop being alive.\n\nThese two game modes go hand-in-hand with flashy graphics (very flashy... more about that soon) and ambient sounds that could sometimes give you the creeps. After all, being on an alien planet with lifeforms is the absolute unknown, at first you don't know what to expect. Alas, with the game still being in alpha phase I guess there is one thing to be expected. 'alpha' is a stage in software development where the full list requirements hasn't been implemented yet, and those that are available likely do not work as intended yet. This is why Starforge is released under Steam's Early Access program.\n\nThis shouldn't be a problem. If you're new to Starforge you would likely conclude the same at this point and ask yourself, "why mention something that's simply a matter of time?". I'm mentioning it because it has grown into a problem. Code}{atch has been hiring personnel - 20 fulltime and 3 parttime to be exact - and even rented an office building, yet so far did not manage to release anything with consistency where needed: quality and release frequency. The big 0.5 patch released in December of 2013 should have been a game changer, and while this was very much the case, players expected it to be of higher quality considering the copious amounts of man-hours between the previous patch and the fact its release had been stalled months multiple times. All the expected alpha stage quirks are represented in Starforge at the moment, from flickering graphics to memory leaks, bad designed NPCs, physics bugs and multiplayer client synchronization mismatches. In short, the game changer became the game breaker: a lovely tech demo had been replaced by an iffy game that plays like you're navigating a maze of bugs and glitches.\n\nWhile Starforge might eventually turn into the game it was supposed to be, the past shows a game that suffers mismanagement and bad quality control. The proposed 2014 beta release date does not seem feasible to me unless Code}{atch has been holding back, which would be an incompetent practice of handling resources. They seem to have the creativity and manpower to work this out, but not the discipline.\n\nIt's up to you to decide if you buy into this or not. My €10,- was something I could miss at the time, but ever since the price has risen I don't find it unthinkable that you might stall this purchase for a year or two because of the reasons addressed here.","April 16, 2014","false","10.8"," 26 of 47 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","26","47","0","2"

Rather than write another negative review/beat a dead horse, I'd like to point out the biggest issue with the game: CodeHatch. This is a PRIME example of why the Steam Early Access needs to be revised.\n\nSome people seem to think that there are going to be more updates to the game. CodeHatch has already made an official announcement that they aren't going to be releasing any updates unless the game sells well after v1.0. I'm pretty sure that didn't happen. Also, a former CodeHatch employee ran an exposé on Reddit a while ago discussing the fast-track to v1.0. Allegedly there was very poor financial management and they were forced to quickly run from Alpha to Beta to Full Release in about 6 months. I'm pretty sure no serious game has ever done that. CodeHatch even had to refund some of their IndieGoGo backers because they didn't fulfill their side of the campaign promises. Seriously, look up the IndieGoGo campaign promises. It's sad.\n\nBottom line: if you are the one person who read the negative reviews and still feels optimistic about the game then do yourself a favor and read through the news updates on the community page and check out the forums. This game isn't worth buying on principle alone. The fact that the gameplay and content are just terrible just adds insult to injury.","October 29, 2014","false","31.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Unfortunately, due to its lack of frequent updates in the early stages, I had uninstalled it, giving time for some updates to be applied in the following months. The game was quite promising at the time. Had a few bugs (which is normal for early access), but nothing that couldn't be fixed\n\nToday, while checking my library, I saw this game and told myself that I could give it a go, and see what's new. I then see in the game news that it is out of early access. I said to myself that this was awesome! The game is now complete. So I proceed to download the game and launch it. Having got myself a new gaming PC recently, and since the game used to run smoothly on my old PC on average settings, I decide to put everything in the max. Game crashes. The very first game I instal on this computer that crashes due to graphics. So I lower it a little bit, and then I can play.\n\nI have only the very basic gear, but I know that the first step in survival games is to gather as much resources as you can, and so I start digging with the first (of 3) drills... I then feel a bit... weak. I can dig a maximum 1 unit of resource every 3-4 seconds. The depth of the hole I made? About 1'... Even to hide yourself, digging at this speed would be innefficient (which is what the game suggest doing). But still I dig, and dig, and dig... only dirt, after a good 10-15 minutes of digging. So I decide to look arround, if there wouldn't be any other resources that I could use to protect myself.\n\nI do find a sort-of hill, and decide to dig it. Oil. Oil?! Solid oil? What the.... Still, I decide to dig a hole in it, barely enough for me to fit in, and close the exit with the few resources I had. I start digging around, to make some room. I go back out of my hole, find a hill shaped in the EXACT SAME WAY as my oil hill. I dig some iron, to make stuff with it, head back to my oil-hole, and decide to build a smelter.\n\nI decide where to place it, see the image of where the smelter will be, decide it's a good spot, place it.... it's 3' beside where it was supposed, and it's upside-down. I remove it, trying putting it back, thinking my mouse may have moved, similar result. I try a third time, still not placed where it is supposed, but it is more "acceptable" than the first 2 attempts, and I think it's as best as I could get.\n\nI am starting to get hungry, so I tried to hunt something. My hunting weapon? The very same drill that only hits once every 3-4 seconds. I head to a monster (which OBVIOUSLY was a hostile mob, that's my luck.), and start TRYING to hit it. it has longer reach than me, my weapon takes a short time to actually attack, not him, and he knocks me back. Needless to say, I'm getting killed.\n\nNow, night is comming. Better build some light sources, so I can see if some of those ******* mobs comes around my oil-hill. so I look at my crafting recipes. Only one that is for light is a wall lamp, requiring resources that I have no access to. What about torches? Are we so "evolved" that we don't even know fire in this game? So all I have is a flashlight. Yay...\n\nSo that's what happened to me in the 50~ minutes I played today. I'm in the dark, half-dead of hunger, stuck in a oil-hill, because monster are outside waiting to kill me.\n\nTL;DR: Game had a lot of hopes for, but ended up without most of the promised stuff. Game is still full of obvious bugs, non-logical objects (wtf, a hill made out of oil? I know that it is possible to find oil in sand, but this is far from looking like it), and you cannot hope to kill hostile mobs unless you have guns, which I wish you good luck to get the resources for. Also, during the alpha, other gameplay modes have been removed, even if they seemed to work fine back then.","October 6, 2014","false","2.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It had promise and the concept is solid. But it is not even close to being a rull release. It's glitchy, unpolished, has some terrible animation (in the areas it's not just completely lacking animation), and is a complete waste of money.\n\nLook at games like Space Engineers that are still considered early access, yet are a way more polished than this. Yet this is now considered full release. Which means that aside from maybe some content additions, this is how the game is and that's it. No further polishing or anything.\n\nThe StarForge developers have completely ignored the community for the game to their downfall. They could have bit the bullet and did was the Rust Developers decided to do and start from scratch. That revitalized their community and gave them hope for what they paid for.\n\nInstead I paid for a half-done game. And when I asked for my money back since I did not get what was promised me I was told, "Maybe you'll think twice in the future supporting Early Access games like this.

We all know that most of these reviews say not recomended and we also know that because of that, there are not going to be many sales causing this game to never get updated again. I am ACTUALLY happy the developers ran out of money, it just comes to show how stupid they were... They could have put up a message saying that they needed money to continue development, and I am absalutely sure that poeple would have donated... but there is one factor im not taking in... its greed. This drives us to do the most idiotic things, loose customers and money. Greed is the reason we got watch dogs on pc with downgraded graphics, Greed is the reason many games bought by perfect world become pay to win. Greed is the reason why we don't get anything actually WORTH spending money on... I know people won't read this because it is long, but I will explain how bad the developers left the game when they released it.\n\n1) Character movement is VERY clunky and unpolished. First person view is very unpolished and odd.\n2) Last I checked the game is not very optimised especially online (I have a very good computer and im running at 20 fps)\n3) Lacks weapons and polish on the features. Most of the features in alpha have been removed, such as the fort defence mode.\n4) The world redering and generation is terrible, when you move to get close to a piece of terrain, it sometimes changes its shape completely.\n5) Lacks a veraity of vehicles, weapons and armor.\n\nI think you get the point...

I see all these neat trailers and screenshots, so I really tried to get into this game. I love the concept and it had potential, but as a 'fully' released game with a 19.99 pricetag?

Rather than write another negative review/beat a dead horse, I'd like to point out the biggest issue with the game: CodeHatch. This is a PRIME example of why the Steam Early Access needs to be revised.\n\nSome people seem to think that there are going to be more updates to the game. CodeHatch has already made an official announcement that they aren't going to be releasing any updates unless the game sells well after v1.0. I'm pretty sure that didn't happen. Also, a former CodeHatch employee ran an exposé on Reddit a while ago discussing the fast-track to v1.0. Allegedly there was very poor financial management and they were forced to quickly run from Alpha to Beta to Full Release in about 6 months. I'm pretty sure no serious game has ever done that. CodeHatch even had to refund some of their IndieGoGo backers because they didn't fulfill their side of the campaign promises. Seriously, look up the IndieGoGo campaign promises. It's sad.\n\nBottom line: if you are the one person who read the negative reviews and still feels optimistic about the game then do yourself a favor and read through the news updates on the community page and check out the forums. This game isn't worth buying on principle alone.

I payed for a different game back then, it lookied like a great game and people seemed to like it, go look at the very old trailers from when the game was in it's infancy.  I loved the crappy gravity system in which you could jump around and the fact that there was a decent parkour sorta system, I also loved the guns that would fling you in the air. They screwed somthing up since the crap that they are selling is nothing near what they promised. We were promised and then given randomly generated guns but they took those out. We were promised stress on buildings so if they were made poorly they would break but we never saw this either.The list goes on, I am not mad about the awful state of the game or the fact that they abandoned it, I am made becasuse they have not delived any of those original features. The devs lied to us then gave us this crap. DO NOT BUY THIS SH*TTY GAME NO MATTER WHAT.\n\nThis is what I wanted to buy. https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/starforge#/story http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=104660511\n\nLook at what they said would be in the game, watch some of the old trailers, and you will see what this game was and should be. What I dont get is that they already had a working game then. If they would just give us what is seen in the greenlight trailers I would gladly give them a thumbs up.","July 27, 2015","false","50.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

We installed it, played around for a bit, then eagerly awaited the promised additional content.\n\nAnd waited. And waited some more.\n\nFinally, both of us wound up uninstalling the game to make room for other games that we played far more often, thinking that "Maybe we'll come back to it, once they've had some time to add a bit of polish."\n\nThis was a couple a years ago, and nothing has been done. The game has been completely abandoned, which saddens me, because this game held such promise. It's made me a little leary about buying into early access titles since, because of this one major black mark.\n\nThankfully, some of the other early access titles I've purchased have actually been worth the money I've spend, but I've gotten lucky with those. This will forever remain a massive failure, and there's no way to get the rather expensive Founders Package refunded.

I've had this game since it all started. It seemed promising and every update (there were few and they updated with major time differences) added something a little new and something interesting to the game. The devs never fully lived up to their promise though. They promised a very intricate weight system on building that would cause stress and tension in certain points of the building to make it unstable. They also promised that player weight would play into stress on the building and would require you to build supports to compensate for that. Not even a word about that has been mentioned since then. They were supposed to have procedural guns and vehicles that were actually useful but in the terrain that's generated, they aren't even of use. They haven't delivered even 10% of what they promised. I think the one thing that they promised that although very broken is actually in the game, is procedural landscapes. The game is also extremely laggy for no good reason. I can play arma 3 with settings maxed and not have a single issue, but this sad excuse for a product with low quality textures and really bad models is making my computer run like a bucket of nails? I'm sorry but that's just not acceptable. I bought this game with very high hopes and sad to say it's pretty much ruined early access for me. I spent 20 bucks on this game that would be so much better off in my pocket. Don't waste your money on this.","December 30, 2014","false","11.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Throughout its development, updates were few and far between and contained very little content when they did occur.  There are too many bugs to list in a short jot but I can guarantee you that they are inexcusable.  I can't say the game is poorly optimized.  It's not optimized at all.\n\nGame content is nothing near what was advertised.  The game is so basic that it's appalling that they would ever consider it to be a release candidate.  This game had so much potential and that is what lured me into investing into it.  Unfortunately, they did not deliver.\n\nTruly, this game could have been so much more and had potential to separate itself from the rest of the pack.  This game didn't fall short; it fell on its face.  The game is not interesting or immersive and certainly contributes to my lost faith in the Steam Early Access program.","January 3, 2015","false","18.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I virtually shelved it in my library and waited patiently for good updates to come but they never did, and the game was released unfinished just to take off that 'early access' status so the devs can stop the mandatory updates and get away with all the money.\n\nGameplay is lacking, gets boring very fast.\nGame is laggy. very unoptimized.\nA lot of features that were promised are non-existent.\n\nI don't blame the Early Access model, it's there for games like Kerbal Space Program, in which I would lose approx. 1000 hours of fun if it the model hadn't existed. For games like Minecraft, Starbound, Arma 3, GalCiv 3, etc\n\nIn the future I would be more careful about buying early access games unless the ratings are 90% Positive and above, and the game is already feature complete, Thanks Enhanced Steam for that extra data! right now I'm seeing 33% Positive 67% Negative, which is very bad\n\nOne thing that's good about this game is that now I know that I would never buy anything from CodeHatch again, that is if they ever made another game.

I first bought the game when the yogscast did a let's play of it years ago, back when it was a fairly amusing base defence. The devs then updated the game with an infinite terrain generator, which at the time seemed like it was going to be someway to get randomised levels and make the game a little less repetitive, but now? The game is a glitchy, buggy mess. Bad animation, textures glitching out when you get too far away from them, biomes have no transition between each other at all etc. Basically all the boxes for a crappy sandbox title have been ticked by the devs, who will now update the game 'based on future sales'. Instead of telling you not to waste £15 on this trash, I'm going to list a bunch of other games that are cheaper and better than StarForge:\n\nRust - £14.99\nTerraria - £6.99\nStarbound - £11.99\nRodina - £10.99\nGarry's Mod - £5.99\nSpace Engineers - £14.99\nDon't Starve - £10.99\n\nAll of those games have either building, exploration or both (StarForge's two main selling points) in spades, and are much MUCH better value for money and all of their dev teams are much more caring than the devs that worked on StarForge.\n\n\n\n\n","October 18, 2014","false","5.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I really did.\nBack when I bought it during Alpha, it showed so much promise. Procedural weapons? An actual Capture the Flag mode in a voxel game? I was willing to throw some money at it for those alone. Every now and then, I'd check in on it and see that yes, it was shaping up to be an interesting game.\nWhat they released as the "final" product is a shameful and unplayable product.\nAll of that which made it unique is gone. What's left is a generic Unity-template Minecraft clone. I tried to like this game; I love crafting games, I love open world games, and I am content just building big forts and collecting things. If a game lets me do those things I can play it for hours regardless of how generic it is.\nBut I cannot play this game, and I will tell you why: bugs.\nThere are wonky things with the physics sometimes where players and enemies just launch into the air. A few times I was mining and suddenly my entire inventory vanished. But the worst is the terrain generation. You play for any length of time and terrain will slowly stop generating to the point where you can't move. But enemies can move, and radiation will kill you. I may have a humble Ivy bridge i7, 16 GB of ram, and a 680 GTX, but even dropping the quality to the lowest setting, closing all other applications, and reducing resolution to a 1024x768 resolution didn't stop the terrain issue nor stop the FPS from dropping to about 10. Looking at memory usage, the game starts grabbing 2-3 GB of memory at this point; there is a major memory leak somewhere, and the game is unplayable with it present.\nAnd yet that is still not the most heart breaking part. This game showed so much potential during alpha. All those elements that I found fun in this game are still there somewhere, because I played them in alpha: the procedural weapons, the unique game modes, I'm assuming it's all there hidden away somewhere. I know this game is capable of being good, because I played it when it was, and if it decides to bring those back and fix all those gamebreaking bugs I will gladly recommend this to friends and start playing again.\nBut as it stands, I can not. This game can be summed up in one word: disappointing.","October 19, 2014","false","7.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The developers obviously lost sight of that or became to in tune with the idea of limitations to create what they originally promised.

I virtually shelved it in my library and waited patiently for good updates to come but they never did, and the game was released unfinished just to take off that 'early access' status so the devs can stop the mandatory updates and get away with all the money.\n\nGameplay is lacking, gets boring very fast.\nGame is laggy. very unoptimized.\nA lot of features that were promised are non-existent.\n\nI don't blame the Early Access model, it's there for games like Kerbal Space Program, in which I would lose approx. 1000 hours of fun if it the model hadn't existed. For games like Minecraft, Starbound, Arma 3, GalCiv 3, etc\n\nIn the future I would be more careful about buying early access games unless the ratings are 90% Positive and above, and the game is already feature complete, Thanks Enhanced Steam for that extra data! right now I'm seeing 33% Positive 67% Negative, which is very bad\n\nOne thing that's good about this game is that now I know that I would never buy anything from CodeHatch again, that is if they ever made another game.

Additionally, you should also avoid Reign of Kings, the devs' other game and any other games they may develop. They are essentially scammers.\n\n\n\nLet me start off by quoting the discussion board of Starforge's official wiki page:\n\n\n"Starforge is perhaps one of the WORST games ever to release early access on Steam.\n\nThe game was falsely marketed. The game was sold incomplete with none of the promised content.\n\nIt also jumped from Alpha 0.7 to Full release in one update..?? How..?? I would like to add since the 1.04 update Starforge is UNRUNNABLE on midspec pcs even when the resolution, detail, aa settings are all turned to minimum/off and it seems to very quickly overwork and eventually overheat computers it is running from.\n\nFurthermore the developers of Starforge are banning any of its player base who states that this game was not sold as advertised. And no, because of the Steam TOS, we do not get a refund for a non playable game."\n\n\n\nThis is an unfinished mess that I have had made the regrettable decision to buy back when this game had initially come out. This game is an incomplete sandbox game that was SUPPOSED to offer so much and promised everyone that purchased in early access everything from gun customization to a vast variety of biomes. When it was first announced, everyone though that this would be too good to be true, but everyone jumped on the bandwagon, believing the developers' passion and their commitment. Now fast forward just about a year later and I will tell you that this game is still unfinished and abondoned.\n\nI understand if there is too much for a developer to take on. If they have to fall back away from their initial view of their game and let their buyers know, then I would be pretty understanding, but the developers never explained why this game was never completed or why they never notified their buyers of their abondonment of the game.\n\nNow, I'm sure you're wondering how I know they've abandoned this game? These developers are also the same exact devs designing Reign of Kings. The game that had more traction with Youtubers and other players of the survival genre. I can't say for sure why the devs wouldn't let buyers know about them giving up on this game, but know for a fact that this game is not worth a single penny in its current state and will NEVER be unless the developers go back on designing this game and actually fulfilling at least half of what they've originally offered.\n\nIf this type of action is intentional, there is no place for that in gaming. Gamers put a lot of trust into developers that how they portray/describe their game is accurate and not misleading, especially since the decline of usage of demos (which is understandable, but not an excuse for misleading anyone with or without it), but telling people all these things you plan to do, not follow through, and THEN not inform your buyers and hope they forget? It's absolutely despicable. I hope that eventually Steam will offer the option to rate not only the game itself, but their developers so that people recognize developers that do not follow through with their promises on previous games or have shown that their business strategies are toxic to the gaming community as a whole.","July 5, 2015","false","1.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The world is massive and randomly generated all of which is great. What is not so great is that their is ZERO points of interest.  There is only a handfull of broken ships litered in this massive world, but its always the same ship. Their is no buildings to discover, no signs of inteligence anywhere.  Just tree's, desert, snow and more snow!  There is never really a point to go adventuring other than to collect ressources and upgrade your character. Which can be a bit of fun, however it gets repetitive and there is hardly a point to having a strong character if the world around isnt worth exploring.\n\nNow the world could have been made interesting online by exploring and discovering other people's creations. However the servers have such a hard time saving a building you built ten minutes ago. You will most likely never see any buildings at all. Just a bunch of half naked men, complaining that this game is broken. That leads me to my conclusion. This game has no direction, you want to create a super soldier yet there is no reason to have a super soldier if the world isn't worth exploring.  You want to create an awesome base, but you can't because the servers will loose it all in a matter of minutes.  For every Positive there is a massive negative. It feels as though the game is incomplete, and it is.","November 7, 2014","false","17.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

I am also, quite Frankly; dissapointed in the ability for users to give early access review.. I feel like all of those down votes from users could have crippled morale for this small indie team over the last few months.\n\nBut on another note: The game still has potential; but it definately veered away from the original concepts that were to be added. As far as these being promises, I can't tell if the developers *promised* those features. If you play the game in its state in and out; there are areas that are enjoyable; but then you have a unpolished, buggy and rushed game.\n\nI am overall dissapointed, but with a small understanding of what factors into this rush. Maybe the developers ran into big obstacles and decided to give up and release the game. This isn't a good move on their part, but I suppose there is no way for them to take it off release state and put it back into Alpha.","September 19, 2014","false","6.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The game sounded great, had a fantastic vision and seemed to have a lot of support.  I eagerly bought the Founders double pack and waited to have amazing adventures with my friends.\n\nThen the vision changed.  Became smaller.  And smaller again.  And again and again until what we were promised and what we got were two wildly different things.  On top of that, now the developer is ceasing further work on the game because of 'declining sales'?  Yet another broken promise (not to mention, what did you expect?  You racked up huge sales during Early Access, of course sales after full launch are going to be 'down').\n\nStarforge is an exemplary reason why I just can't bring myself to do Early Access games any more.  It's a shame those devs who could use the support won't get it, but when shams like this game exist and burn and cheat gamers out of a not insignificant amount of cash, you can't keep expecting them to buy in on dreams and promises.\n\nDon't buy this game, don't support this kind of dishonesty.","September 14, 2014","false","5.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","2"
