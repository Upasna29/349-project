"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lolcust/recommended/319510/","Lolcust","Locust","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lolcust/","473 products in account","Five Nights at Freddy's is an awesome little indie game that's become very popular in a short span of time. The gameplay is simple - you're in a room and have the ability to control the lights and doors of your office as well as the ability to monitor the cameras dotted around the building. You need to keep an eye on the four animatronics that will move around and kill you if they manage to enter your office. To make things more difficult, you have a very limited amount of power which is drained more quickly if you keep lights turned on and doors closed, effectively meaning you need to leave yourself exposed if you want to survive.\n\nAs a horror game, it works very well. The robots are suitably unnerving and the game makes you extremely paranoid thanks to the lighting and sound effecs. There's nothing unfair about the game - if you can keep your cool and use your resources effectively, you'll be fine, but more often than not the player will end up panicking and being punished for it. The atmosphere and story are fantastic as well - the messages and notes left behind for the player all add up to create a very enigmatic yet creepy story that people are still speculating on, combined with numerous other easter eggs.\n\nThe developer seems down to earth and willing to listen to his fans, and has already promised a sequel. I would recommend buying the game to support him for this reason and so that we can hopefully see more games like this. The game is not huge, but it's a great addition to the horror genre and is definitely something all horror fans should want to see more of in a sea of action games and zombies.","August 19, 2014","true","0.6"," 4,447 of 4,822 people (92%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","92","447","4","33","114"

And it doesn't matter the setting or location, working at night can be very unsettling. Alone with your thoughts in a dimly lit ANYPLACE during the witching hour can be literally the worst thing ever. The clock tick tocks mockingly as time slows to a crawl and the night grows darker with each passing hour. I'm not a spiritual person... but around three or four in the morning, third cup of coffee in hand and heavy-lidded eyes blinking in futility at the specter of sleep, you start to hear things. Snaps and cracks from the wind. Chittering and chattering from various nocturnal animals. A flash of light across your face as a lonely car makes a very slow u-turn. A bang from something somewhere. And you start to wonder: are you experiencing auditory hallucinations or did you just hear a baby cry? So you walk outside for some fresh air. And just where the light from a distant street lamp falters to the shadows you see something standing. Just. Barely. Noticeable.\n\nJust waiting for you to shut your eyes.\n\nThat paragraph best sums up my experience with “Five Nights At Freddy's.” It is a panic attack simulator ingeniously disguised as a game. You're a recently hired security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a kid friendly pizza party parlor with a sordid, spotted past. For instance, most previous night guards are MURDERED BY HAUNTED ANIMATRONIC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T. And you will be too unless you're hyper diligent. See, not only is Freddy's HAUNTED BY THE LIVING EMBODIMENTS OF EVERY CHILDHOOD NIGHTMARE YOU'VE EVER SUFFERED, it also has an incredibly tight budget (Freddy's is likely crippled financially by dozens of lawsuits). They have only so much energy to expend from twelve at night to dawn. Your working hours. You'll have to manage that as you check video camera feeds, turn on the lights just outside your office, and seal your two office doors.\n\nWhen your night begins everything is hunky dory and all the animatronic monstrosities are SILENT AND STILL AS THEY SHOULD ALWAYS BE. But as the night progresses and you check your feed you'll find some things... off. Wait, wasn't Freddy on stage a minute ago? Now he's in the dining area. And huh, where did the ♥♥♥♥ing rabbit goooooOOOOHHHHHHHH ♥♥♥♥!\n\nAnd then you find out where Bonnie the Bunny went.\n\nHe went into your office.\n\nTo eat your eyes.\n\nSo you'll have to be, as I said, diligent. Keep your eyes peeled for the scoundrels as they make their way towards your office. If they get too close (go on, turn the light on just outside the door and have a heart attack) just seal the door. But for every nervous glance at the feed, every light flicked on, and every door slammed shut, your power will drain, eventually leading to an outage. And God help you if that happens. I'm just kidding!\n\nThere is no God.\n\nOnly Freddy.\n\nAt the end of the night (assuming you survive) you'll start another... if you'd like.\n\n\nThis is a simple, terrifying game. It's clever, fun, and will absolutely cause you to shout or shriek at least once. Hell, I shouted at the main screen, and then again a few seconds after that. It marries the fun and inherit hilariousness of the jump scare with a  tense, gripping, paranoia-inducing state - the result of brilliant atmosphere, design, and your own imagination working overtime. And perhaps the best thing about this game is the brilliantly basal story, one told through clues and phone messages. I haven't seen a community delve so deeply into the meaning and depth of a story since "Dark Souls," honestly. "Five Nights At Freddy's" is a testament to horror, to the power of simplicity, and to dedicated indie development.\n\nWait.\n\nDid you just hear something?","August 22, 2014","true","1.2"," 2,769 of 3,013 people (92%) found this review helpful 79 people found this review funny","92","769","3","79","90"

I kept the doors shut the whole time and drained my power in less than five minutes. I give this game major props. I have bad anxiety, and this game has actually helped me a bit with that. The paranoia and anxiety I experienced through my multiple play throughs of the night one and two, helped me realize that things that make me nervous in real life aren't as bad as being chased down by killer animatronics. So thanks for that.\n\nI'd definitly recommend this game to anyone who can last the five nights.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/recommended/319510/","bashfulbritishboy","Schmoes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/","121 products in account","Five Nights at Freddy's is an Indie point-and-click horror game that literally bombed the Steam Store on its very first month of purchase and is infamously known as a fresh breath of games that play along the themes of tension, paranoia and sudden fear. It is also most known amongst fans of the game that famous Youtubers such as Markiplier and PewDiePie who have made the sales of this game boost even higher than usual indie game sales. As a small synopsis related to this game, you'll be waddling through Freddy's game of don't-hide-but-seek, right to the very perilous end.\n\nWith only little power reserved for poor old Mike Schmidt in the Security Guard's Office of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a family restaurant complex, you'll be struggling to stay alive and out of danger on your six hour shift of work, starting from 12 AM to 6 AM for five days straight, hence the title of the game. With every night progressively getting worse in both psychological fear and paranoia. The repulsive animatronics that run alive during the night become much more unpredictable, with unexpected jump scares that will leave your heart to skip a beat and without a doubt, make you want to rage quit the game as quickly as possible. You will be having to deal with Freddy and his fearsome buddies, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken and Foxy the Pirate Fox. Rather cute names, yet really ugly faces indeed.\n\nInspired by the beloved restaurant, Chuck E. Cheese, now, the deepest nightmares of those kids have come to life as these animatronics in game don't want to sing you no birthday song or throw you a party. They simply plan to crush your body into a mascot costume, completely mashing, fracturing and probably suffocating you in the process. Pretty gruesome way to die, no?\n\nWhat makes this game very intriguing is the community's efforts on theorizing the deeper meanings of the game's overall plot and context. Ranging from how the phone guy is the actual killer, to Foxy being a good animatronic rather than a bad one. This is all deeming down and shredding away the structure of the story that makes us think in our own perception. And I love the community's reasons for that as it takes devotion and well-thought ingenuity to piece together the mysteries that still lingers on, even to this day.\n\nThe game honestly doesn't become as scary as you may think. If you have been playing for hours upon end, it becomes somewhat highly addictive in a sense. Not to spoil anything about the game, but after the main five nights, you have an optional 6th night and even after that, you can proceed to the insane 20/20/20/20 difficulty mode, where you're doomed from the very start. Unless you can manage to live through it that is.\n\nThis game actively toys around with your mind, as you will mindlessly switch the lights on and shut the doors in the much more frightening and perilous nights ahead. Things begin to get real hectic as odd noises protrude from various locations in the restaurant, from the animatronics humming, to random musical tune, to loud footsteps and of course, the demonic laughter. You never know if Bonnie and Chica are ganging up on you or even worse, if you can't turn the lights on or shut the doors, knowing you're doomed with an eventual jumpscare at the end. Even Foxy begins to act creepy, since he's the biggest reserved essence of paranoia for me; you never know his patterns directly and you're left shook up if or when you witness his hasteful, creepy run down the hall, leaving you only little precious seconds to slam the emergency door down, or else you'll be greeted with an expected jumpscare and a game over.\n\nDefinitely recommend this game, and the time I recommend to play this game perfectly fits at midnight, all alone in the dark. I bloody dare you and if you have completed this game, congratulations! Move onto the even more scarier sequels that wait up ahead, brave soul. It's about to get a whole lot more nightmarish.","October 21, 2014","true","3.8"," 708 of 804 people (88%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","88","708","804","32","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkyeF/recommended/319510/","SkyeF","Flutter Skye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkyeF/","413 products in account","Great horror Point-and-Click game. In this game, you're a security guard which got hired in a Pizzeria to work 5 days a week. However, you have the night shift. You don't move around the building, you're in the office, where you get 2 doors, two door lights, and a tablet (Also a freaking fan which takes a lot of power) You use the tablet to look at all locations in the Pizzeria, but you don't look around for criminals - You're looking at the Animatronics, the maskots of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. At night, they free-roaming mode is turned on, and they want to get you. Why? I'll quote the Phone guy here "The Animatronics think you're a naked endoskeleton which is lacking a suit, and all they want to do is stuff you into a suit, which is with a lot of wires in it.  So basically it means if they stuff you into the suit, the suit will kill you because of the wires. Hovewer, that's not true. The Animatronics are haunted - By kids. A few years ago, a man in a Freddy Fazbear suit kidnapped 5 children. They found a suspect, but the kids went missing. They were never found.\nThe Animatronics don't think you're a naked endoskeleton, because Bonnie, one of the Animatronics was next to a endoskeleton in one of the cameras, yet he ignored it.\nAnyways, you use the tablet to look at which place the animatronics currently are. If you don't find any of the animatronics on the camera, it can mean two things:\n1. The Animatronic is next to your door, so you'll need to close it before he gets into the office!\n2. The Animatronic is in your office, waiting for you to lower your camera. To know if he's in the office, you'll hear a weird sound of a child while you're looking at the camera.\n\nYou'll also need to check onto the Pirate Cove between "Often" and "Not very often" if you don't do that, Foxy will run through the hallway, and get into your office.\nYou can't just close the doors for the whole night. You have limited power. You'll need to survive from 12am to 6am, in all nights. With only 100% power, which gets drained quicker if you have the lights/tablet/doors turned on. So you'll need\nto spare your power, or the office will be in complete darkness, and Freddy will get you when that happens.\nIn the later nights, the game turns into a more "Strategic-Horror" Game. You'll need to plan a strategy, so the four animatronics won't get you, and your power won't get completely drained.\nIt's a really amazing experience, and it costs only 5 bucks. You definitely should buy it, it's really worth it.\n10/10","November 2, 2014","true","12.8"," 312 of 350 people (89%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","89","312","350","12","11"

But Steam forces me to click thumbs up or thumbs down and in the end it gets a thumbs up because even though I had a love/hate relationship with this game, I am strangely glad that I played it.\n\nFive Night at Freddy's starts as a psychological horror game but ends up more of a resource management game. The first four nights were a lot of fun, quite creepy and sometimes scary (although mostly because of jump scares). But by the fifth night the game is all about the resource management to the point where the psychological horror disapears. You are not going to finish it on the first attempt and the chances are by the time you complete this you will be numb and possibly even bored.\n\nNight five is like trying to juggle twelve eggs. The basic idea is pretty simple, but executing it without making a mistake is the problem. It can take a lot of practice and many hair pulling moments. For me night five was not fun, and that is where the problem arises: Night Five is where the game really starts. You will spend more time on night five (and beyond) than the first four days.\n\nIt is not a bad game, and if you like juggling eggs whilst avoiding jump scares it will be sheer joy for you. But for me it was four nights of fun and one very very long night of frustration followed by a brief moment of sheer extasy when I finally finished night five .... and then a painful moment when I saw what was next.\n\nIn the end I recommend this game because it is an experience I am glad I had, and feel it is one most lovers of horror/jump scare games should try once. But do not expect to enjoy every minute of this game unless you are masochistic in nature. Hair pulling and keyboard violence should be expected.","January 20, 2015","true","6.8"," 221 of 247 people (89%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","89","221","247","31","7"

I am just going to describe my experience with it and my opinion about it, and offer a suggestion of consideration to anyone who is interested.\n\nSo I stumbled across Five Nights at Freddy's in my backlog, and I will admit that there was an influence of brand recognition due to the circus that surrounds the game. Perhaps without which, I would still have yet to even try it. Regardless, I was curious about it so I checked it out and played it for a few hours one night.\n\nIt was a fun evening. The game isn’t some insanely life-changing experience, but it is entertaining and has a nice novelty about it. I hadn’t played anything quite like it. You can surely have a fun few hours playing it; I know I did.\n\nIt is extremely and purposefully simple, and there are very little controls or mechanics. This minimalist approach to the gameplay creates a scenario which allows the game to evoke a strong sense of helplessness and anxiety in the player. You really can’t do much, but that is the point. And even with the opening disclaimer about jump-scares, I got “got” a good 2-3 times by them as I played that night. I liked it.\n\nOverall, there isn’t much to it. The game is short, the graphics are ugly, the mechanics are minimal, etc. Five Nights at Freddy's isn’t anything overtly special, but it also isn’t excessively terrible… it just is what it is. It’s like horror movies; they usually aren’t anyone’s all-time favorite, but they can be fun for a night.\n\nSo if we can put aside the trolling that surrounds this game for a moment, and speak logically: you will likely find Five Nights at Freddy's is an entertaining experience that will definitely appeal to horror buffs and casual gamers, but can also easily be enjoyed by a wide range of gamers. That said, if you are one of those people who believes only the most top-shelf, A-one, premium games “deserve” to be played, you should probably just stay clear. For everyone else: don’t expect the second coming of Jesus Christ, but also don’t expect some unbearably awful experience… just expect a few hours of cheap thrills and then to move on with your life. If that sounds cool with you, then consider checking this out.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","February 13","true","2.1"," 170 of 198 people (86%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","86","170","198","19","7"

It's very much a resource management game in that sense.\n\nThe graphics seem to be pre-rendered 2D style, which to be honest, they don't look the best, the security office where the whole game takes place is very pixelated and it doesn't look very pleasing, however the character models of the other bears etc. look quite cool.\n\nAs in all other horror games, the music and sound effects play the most critical role, they set the mood, and give you the most jump scare effects, and they are done very well here. The levels are all set in the same place; they just get progressively harder and harder, with different techniques used by the bears on each stage.  The game is pretty hard once you get to Night 3 onwards, and will probably have you cowering in fear.\n\nThe whole game took two hours to complete the Five Nights, this felt just the right length as I don't think I could any more of the jumps and suspense.\n\nPeople who seek that jump scare experience will find the thrill here; and the puzzle aspect of having to look after your power management is a nice feature, so overall, I can recommend Five Nights at Freddy's.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

For one, it's incredibly clever, well conceived (you won't find another game that uses faux-90s low quality computer graphics to its strengths) and so immersive that, yes, its atmosphere and jump scares result in it being a surprisingly terrifying experience. The story doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but there is supposedly a supernatural twist that the developer has somehow hidden away in the game which might clear things up.\n\nSo if you like buying games you'll never play because you're too scared to do it, or if you're prepared to delve deep into the disturbing depths of late 90s pizza parlor horror, get ready for Freddy.","August 19, 2014","true","0.2"," 140 of 162 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","140","162","0","10"

Believe me when I say it is one of the most terrifying horror games ever made and it really is as scary as most people make it out to be. The way it plays with your head and toys with you makes you feel so vulnerable and isolated, it isn't like anything else I've felt in any other horror game.\n\nWhat makes this game so unique is two things: its gameplay, and how you have to survive. Normally in horror games you've got the ability to roam around the map, run, hide and pick up items to help improve your odds of survival. Not in this. You're confined to just one room with a device that lets you take a look at the camera feeds throughout the pizzaria, and in this one room are two doors to the left and to the right, both of which are JUST out of your peripheral vision. You've also got a light for each doorway, since it's completely pitch black through them, so that you can see what is through the doorway (trust me when I say you'll be needing to use those lights very often).\n\nHere you might say "well why can't I just close these two doors for the whole night and not have to bother looking at the cameras or turning the lights on?" It drains the power quite rapidly. If you drain the power early, it's game over... just not instantly. Because of this, you want to conserve as much of your power as you can, which means you won't have the option of keeping either of the doors closed for the whole time, nor the option to keep the lights on. This is where the game becomes pretty terrifying. And then there's Freddy and his pals...\n\nIt'll be easy for those who want action in their games to dismiss this title, since you are only in one room for the whole game. But holy ♥♥♥♥ do things become tense very early and very quickly. If you are a horror fan, this is an ESSENTIAL title that you NEED to play.","August 19, 2014","true","1.1"," 127 of 145 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","127","145","0","3"

The player's influence on the world around him is limited - the only way you can fend off the creatures is to track the threat and close the doors around you when they appear. Given that operating anything uses up your precious power resources, you're left exposed for most of the game and can only act in your own defence when the threat is at your doorstep. Furthermore, you can only know that the threat is there if you turn on the lights temporarily, and the knowledge that there may be something watching you from the black abyss that lies just outside the door is terrifying in itself. So throughout the game the player is left powerless, exposed, fearing the unknown, feeling like the enemy is one step ahead, and incapable of eliminating the threat, only delaying it. These are the emotions that truly thrill you and scare you. The jump-scare is merely the pay off to the complex and deep tension that the game creates. And it does all this on a shoe-string, exposing just what a solid and simple concept can do for the gamer.\n\nI now get why this game became so popular, and while the things you see and hear on Youtube may make you feel like the game is nothing more than a cheap thrill, I think it's a deceptively simple but masterfully crafted experience.","June 16, 2015","true","0.9"," 132 of 157 people (84%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","84","132","157","10","7"

Whilst it's a place where kiddies go during the day to have fun and party, you aren't here during the day, no, you're the Night Watchman After all, you gotta sit the night shift through to get your meager living, how else will the bills for your crappy apartment get paid?\nWhat are you watching for? Burglars? Teenage no-do-gooders? No, you're keeping an eye on the Animatronics themselves, Now, the Animatronics are left in Free-Roaming mode at night so they don't break down more than they already have, they used to be able to during the day, but that ended up with one of the Animatronics being decommissioned and some poor soul without a frontal lobe.\nThis wouldn't be a problem, but the animatronics will stuff any naked endoskeleton (I know there are theories that they're just murderous, but I'll just go with this for now) into a Freddy Fazbaer suit, it won't damage an endoskeleton, but with all those wires 'n crap in the suits, imagine what they would do to a person? Speaking of a person, guess what the Animatronics think humans are? (hint: An Endoskeleton)\nThe establishment is in decline, after multiple lawsuits and events (including an infamous event where a man dressed up in a Freddy Fazbear costume and kidnapped and murdered children) it's low on funding, kids and their parents aren't as willing to come to if after the public events, and the whole thing is expected to be closed by the end of the year.\nBecause of this state, they have a limited nightly electricity budget meaning that you have only a limited amount of energy with which to do things such as check the cameras, light up the hallways that lead to your office, and close the doors to prevent the animatronics from stuffing you into a suit, with limited power comes with the fact that closing the doors would mean you're wasting it, and you thus need to leave yourself exposed if you don't want the power to go off as Freddy sings to you his Toreador music box before he ends your night abruptly.\nThe game has a dark setting, a terrifying atmosphere, and is a great title, everything from the dark hallways to the animatronics themselves, everything about this game is great, you're going to be blown away by the subtle yet terrifying world this game is set in, with rumors still circulating about its mystical yet dark plot and background of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, you're going to love Five Nights at Freddy's.","November 5, 2014","true","6.8"," 49 of 51 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","49","51","2","1"

When I turned 18, I was short on money so I got the latest newspaper and checked out it's jobs for hire section. My eyes became wide and pants tightened when I saw there was an opening as a night watch guard at Freddy Fazbears Pizza. I ran to the phone, called the number listed and after a quick interview, I got the job. I still had Freddy figurines, posters and pins laid out in my attic, enclosed in a secret room where I built my Freddy Fazbear Shrine. My prized lifesize Freddy doll laid there as well, who I would whisper to occasionally and caress gently until I fell asleep. After all these nights of praying to Freddy, he answered me. I must not dissapoint him. I began by ordering pizza. When it arrived I let it cool and rubbed the slices, slowly, all over my naked body, being very careful not to miss covering Freddy's favorite spots. The scent of pizza pleases him. I was ready and left my house. When I got there, it was clear the doors were left open for me. At 11:59 I entered the office. Then clock had struck 12:00 AM. I was ready for Freddy. As I began to undress I heard noises coming from the Dining hall. After removing the last of my undergarments, I checked the cameras and saw that the bunny and chicken had smelt my cheese and tomatoe sauce covered body first. "NO" I said, "THIS IS FOR FRED". I checked the band stage and realized Freddy was not there, He heard. I glanced at the cameras again. Bonnie was coming down the left hall and the Chica was in the kitchen. Suddenly the cameras to my right went down. Freddy was here. Just as I was going to go out for him, all the lights shut off. This was perfect. He knew how to set the mood.... he knew how...I liked it. Frantically, I dropped to the floor, got on my knees and bent over. I cried out "THIS FOR YOU FREDDY". I saw his face, his LED eyes shined between my thighs and the Freddy Fazbear theme began playing out of his speakers. Tears of joy began streaming down my cheeks. His pizza dispensing pipe began extending out from his pelvis. One thrust and he began filling me with his delicious pizza love. I woke up in a Bear suit and couldnt feel my legs. 10/10\nFreddy is love\nFreddy is life","August 23, 2014","true","4.2"," 52 of 64 people (81%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","81","52","64","8","3"

I mostly just let other people do it, and I will read them when I need to. However not only has the game blown me away, but the creator has aswell.\nSo I am very picky about scary games, I like the idea of constantly being scared but I also find constant popups repetitive and at some point boring. This game is NEVER slow, you are constantly waiting for what will happen next. It has a mix of pop ups that are unique and at some points you just go, "♥♥♥♥, I know its coming, and I'm ♥♥♥♥ed." This is a game I make every one of my friends play when they come over. There isn't a huge story plot, but enough to make you go, "This is ♥♥♥♥ing terrifying." and Spoiler Alert? When you get to Night 7, you can customize how hard different characters will be, AMAZING! I bought the game on a platform similiar to Steam which I won't name but with little to no research you can guess what it is. I only used this platform for the game, and hated it otherwise. I emailed the creator asking if he would give me a key to get the game on steam so I could delete this horrible game launcher. He sends me a code within an hour. No hassle at all! This guy is truly amazing and I can't wait for what he has to come. Everyone buy this game!","August 19, 2014","true","1.4"," 43 of 50 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","43","50","0","4"

Maybe the originality, or that it's single-handedly made, or that it's very simple and there's no need to learn complicated mechanics, I don't know. Probably all of them combined. Even after the little time I played, I still feel Freddy breathing over my shoulder every time I get up to use the toilet in the night. I bought it for 2€ and I'm happy I did. It's a unique experience, you don't run from the evil robots, you sit and close the door when they come.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Quady14/recommended/319510/","Quady14","Quady14","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Quady14/","541 products in account","I'm a little surprised at the overwhelming positive response Five Nights at Freddy's has gotten. I suppose I can understand it's entertaining at first glance, but a lot of the reviews I've read have play times mostly less than an hour or two, and some admit they didn't get further than Night 3, which is totally understandable, post-Night 3 was probably where the entertainment factor dropped off for me and the game became an exercise in tedium. And then I played it for 6 or 7 more hours just to try to finish the thing out of obligation. Anyways, let me get this out of the way:\n\nThe game is innovative. The reason it's gotten as popular as it has is because it's a fresh take on a genre that sadly has been dragging its feet lately. I'd absolutely love to see more Horror games try new things like this, and it's not bad that people are experimenting with new ways to convey interactive horror. I'm just as sick of seeing cheap-quality episodic Amnesia knock-offs and "Collect-Items-While-Monster-Stalks-You" romps as anyone else, but I still have severe enough gripes with Five Nights that I really can't give it a recommendation for anything other than as a very temporary novelty.\n\nIf you intend on fully experiencing this game, prepare for the possibility of a good couple hours failing the same night over, and over, and over. Seriously the 9 hours I spent on this were mostly Nights 4, 5 and 6, I eventually gave up at 6 because I decided the payoff was seriously not worth my time.\n\nAs it turns out, Five Night's idea of using energy management to build tension just doesn't work in its favor in the long-term. Once you boil the game down to its base mechanics, all the charm falls away really quickly, because there's a pretty limited amount to see, a very limited amount to do, and the strict limit on how much energy you can afford to waste on the latter nights becomes unrealistically tight to the point where if you don't play almost perfectly to each situation, and the AI is uncharacteristically passive for its activity level at those later points, you are often destined to lose before you're a little more than halfway through the night.\n\nThere's not much more frustrating than fending off your aggressive attackers for 10 minutes straight, only to realize you've failed the night because Bonnie wouldn't leave the door alone, or because Foxy made a run for you twice because you weren't watching Pirate Cove enough, or watching it too much.\n\nRead all the guides you want, learn all the animatronics' behaviors, that's what I tried to do once just winging it on my own wasn't working out, but Five Nights gets tough as ♥♥♥♥ by late-game, and intense difficulty in what should be a short overall playtime for the length of each night does not impact the horror aspect positively. A horror game does not flourish by treading over the same ground time and again, and that's essentially all that Five Nights can do once you've died a few times.\n\nThe more time you spend with the game, the more you understand, the less likely it'll have anything new to scare you with, and once you hit that point all you have left is frustration that you can't save enough energy to last a couple seconds longer to the safety of 6 AM.\n\nFive Nights builds suspense very well, and its characters are fittingly creepy, but in the end it's always coming up to a couple different animations that play alongside the same exact sound clip with a different model shaking in your face. It loses its edge, and fast. Especially once you learn the tells, like if your wall panel stops working and you check your camera, or if Pirate Cove is empty and you check the West Hallway camera. You come to expect every death, and the only fear comes from how irritating and headache-inducing that damned screaming sound clip is.\n\nIf you're looking for anything more than a novelty, something to spook friends with once or twice, you may find Freddy & Co. becoming a lot more frustrating than they ever were scary. However, if that's all you want, a quick little game to mess about with then uninstall and probably never play again, go for it. As for me, I've played enough of this thing to never really feel inclined to reinstall it. Also, it's getting a sequel? Come on...","September 12, 2014","false","9.3"," 547 of 877 people (62%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","62","547","877","18","79"

What I found was, quite evidently, a labour of love by creator Scott Cawthon.\n\nAside from the kudos toward him for creating the game by his lonesome, it's evident that he's taken much effort to make the game as 'low-fi' as possible. The engine, Multimedia Fusion has been largely untouched since the mid-90s; upon ripping apart the game's files, you'll find all the graphics in the game are encoded in the original CompuServ GIF format - aptly debuting in 1987 (coinciding with the game's entirely ambiguous 'Bite of '87' of which you are informed of the first night); the sound is encoded in earlier versions of FruityLoops (even so far as to be from FLS1.1 - which has been largely unavailable outside of DOS discs from 1997), and even the infamous 'SCREEEE' sound when the animatronics pounce on you is, as far as I am aware, pulled from a public service announcement from the late-80s regarding child safety in the kitchen. Beyond the technical achievements (or rather, deliberate /under/achievements) of the game, the story is told outside of typical explained means, allowing the user to rely on breadcrumbs, theory and superstition - even going so far as to backmask portions of Paramahansa Yogananda's 'Autobiography of a Yogi' into the game's garbled ambience.\n\nCawthon's done as much as possible to set the game's mood, and while its threats reside nigh-entirely in recyclable (and eventually predictable) jumpscares, the atmosphere, sense of isolation, memorable characters, and easily-grasped,  simple mechanics serve a purpose to make this a refreshing and, in a way, quite charming survival-horror game - of which I'm glad to hear will be sequelised.\n\nAt £4, you could do far, far worse.","October 18, 2014","true","5.5"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","36","41","0","3"

Your job is to survive from midnight to 6 AM.Its not a horrifying game, but the scares are done through the building tension of knowing the animatronics are out to get you and seeing where they are.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, you are literally stuck in your one screen office, you can look left and right, when you point your mouse down, a series of monitor comes up that lets you look at one camera at a time. You click each camera individually and you'll see areas of the pizza place and where the animatronics are.\n\nThere are two blind spots and those are directly to the left and right of your office, so there are two buttons. One button is for light to check what's directly outside your door. The other is the door button for when something is right outside your door! You have a door and a light on each side. You can't see both doors at the same time, which can result in jump scares.\n\nSo why not just lock the doors and giggle at the fluffies trying to get in? The challenge to this game is that each night starts you at 100% power. Every moment drains your power slowly, every time you look at the monitor drains your power. When you turn on a light, that is more power too. Plus, the doors are magnetic, so using them really drains your power. Once you are out of power, everything turns dark and well its virtually game over.\n\nAs the nights go on, there will be different animatronic characters you will be warned about. You will get phone calls at the start of every night explaining things. How certain animatronics will act, such as the fox will run at you if you don't check your cameras.\n\nFor $5 it is a good diversion, even if the game is pretty dumb feature wise. New game or continue. No options, but at least you get to continue at the day you failed. A big plus is that the same night can still feel different. So there is a lot of replay, but keep in mind it is a quick game that is one screen with cameras in rooms. I bought it in a $2 bundle, you can too.","September 10, 2014","true","0.8"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","34","38","0","0"

It has a wonderful campaign and mutliplayer.\n\nIn the campaign, you play as Paul Blart, a security guard for Freddy Fatbear's Bar & Grill. As a security guard, your job is to kill the minorities that try to break into the restaurant. Unfortunately, thanks to budget cuts, you are only equipped with Military-Grade Weaponry. You have to shoot the minorities, whose names are Fonzy Fredman, Cholo, b4nny, and Starfox. If you see them, you have to shoot them until they run off, because Military-Grade weapons only keep the minorities at bay. You have to be careful, because if you run out of ammo, the minorities will shank you and call you white racial slurs. There is a secret easter egg that replaces Fonzy Fredman with his cousin, Gay Rattlesnake. If this happens, he gives you a promotion and closes the game because that means you shouldn't be working that awful job anymore.\n\nIn the multiplayer, you play as one of many different Nintendo characters in an all out brawl. Your job is to eliminate the competition in either time or stock matches. The winner climbs the bracket and eventually you can win 1st prize, which is called "Grand Master ♥♥♥♥♥♥"\n\nI highly reccomend this game, as it has brought me many hour of enjoyment.

(You know the kind of job everyone is looking for!)\n\nReguardless of the strange choice in job you chose, the game spans out as a very simple and very easily playable & basic designed game.\n\nWhat you believed to be really simple & easy work turns into one of the most horrific & difficult but 100% worth it times of your life.\n\nThe Story:\nThe story is really simple & i basically explained it above, you're a job seeker who found an ad in the paper about a really easy job being a security guard at Freddy's Fun Farm doing the late shift of a night that's a Monday - Friday.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nYou're to spend 6 hours a night in your little office doing the night shift at Freddy's Fun Farm as a Security Guard, the premise of the game is very simple, make sure that nobody intrudes into Freddy's during the night while trying to avoid the strange & earily creepy Freddy & his robotic friends as they roam the building during the night.\n\nNot everything is as peachy and friendly of a night time though as you'll soon find out because you're running on a timer during the night as power is scarce & you need to save the power as much as you can so that you can keep an eye on Freddy & his friends as they happen to be quite afraid of new people & tend to... well kill people who aren't familiar to them.\n\nEach night becomes increasingly difficult & not only that but it seems to take longer to complete each night, of course if that's not bad enough then you'll find comfort in the fact that Freddy & his friends become more and more active through the week & require a lot more thorough checking in order to avoid winding up like so many other Secutiry Guards before you.\n\nThis game really relies on you to be 100% alert at all times & not only is hard to do that because you're constantly switching between camera's & checking outside your office doors but Freddy & his friends tend to just randomly screw with you on certain playthroughs by disabling the power to your doors or by disconnecting your cameras, not only do they do that but sometimes they completely obscure the camera vision with their evil smiles or to make things worse sneek into your office & while you're busy watching the camera's feel the need to scare the living ♥♥♥♥ out of you!\n\nWorst of all is when you're almost finished & you run out of power only to see Freddy's wonderful smile & hear his jolly music as he stares at you from the door way, at this point you're either very lucky as time ticks over or you're left in the dark awaiting Freddy's embrace as he rips the flesh from your bones.\n\nThe Verdict:\nThere are SOOO many good things i can say about this game but i don't have enough characters to type all of these things, and very few faults i can pick at with this game.\n\nAlthough this game is designed solid & it's scares are not those small little "Oh i saw that coming but it still scared me" scares they're truly terrifying when they happen because you never really know when you're going to get caught by Freddy or his friends & whenever you do it's generally off guard they catch you.\n\nThe AI in this game although very simple is Flawless an it always manages to be challenging even if it's so simple & due to the randomization of the gameplay you never experience the same thing over and over.\n\nSometimes the game can feel unfair when you're almost finished and run out of power, or when Freddy & his friends turn off the power to your doors so you can't close them, or even when Foxy just spawns outside of his cave and runs at you right in the beginning, but it never feels 100% cheap it is just the game really screwing with you and tormenting you, wanting you to continue but at the same time showing that you'll never be guarenteed a win even if you're so close.\n\nThe setting in this game although simple is designed perfect to be creppy even if it is a few different static backgrounds quickly slapped together, it's a flawless attempt at making a horror experience and it works 100% without a doubt.\n\nI give this game a 10/10.\n\nAnd i give it this because there's really no flaws in it, it's just designed perfect in every way, The game is meant to be difficult & it achieves that by occasionally putting you in situations of intense thrills & other times you breeze through without even seeing Freddy or his friends\n\nEven though the game is very much the same each time it makes the experience different each playthough so it gives it replay value & then there's the thrill of beating the levels and knowing that you've overcome the odds and made it through to the next day!\n\nDo I Recommend This Game?:\nYes i do recommend this and i suggest that people buy this game because it's so damn cheap and a well worthy experience. What are you doing reading this now? GO AND BUY THE DAMN GAME!\n\nOther Games You Might Like:\n\nAmnesia: The Dark Decent:\nAmnesia offers you another great horror experience well worth checking out if you're a puzzle solver & like to run & hide rather than fight.\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/57300/\n\nNote: This game has no weapons you must hide if you wish to survive.\n\nOutlast & Whistleblower DLC:\nOutlast also offers an experience well worth playing through at least once as does it's Whistleblower DLC which ties in the original game so you get the full story as to what happened.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/238320/\n\nNote: This game has no weapons you must hide if you wish to survive.\n\nMy Review for Outlast: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles01/recommended/238320/","August 20, 2014","true","1.0"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","2"

Or if you walked around a mall in a really white neighborhood, and saw some little 8 year old fat kid wearing a t-shirt with Five Nights at Freddy's on it, that's an easy way to learn that it exists too. It's a meme, no doubt about it. Let's not beat around the bush about it. Becoming a meme is a double-edged sword to an indie upstart. On one hand, everyone on the internet will know you. Whether they like it or not. On the other hand, not liking it is very common, and they're always on par with or more passionate than the ones that like you.\n\nAside from being the dankest meme of 2014, Five Nights at Freddy's is a humble little survival-horror game. It didn't exactly have it easy. Imagine you're an indie guy, trying to make a game. And people like you. They really like you. But, oh, now they're making furry porn of your characters, and, oh, now they're making cringey memes of your game. Now everyone hates you. Now all of your hard work will forever be remembered as degenerate furry garbage. That's exactly what you get for using anthropomorphic animal characters for your game you ♥♥♥♥ing furry.\n\nIn Five Nights at Freddy's, you're tasked with staying alive in a Chuck E Cheese full of ♥♥♥♥ machines. They want to stuff you in a fur suit and yiff you to death. With no escape, you lock yourself in your office and try to survive the night by closing the doors and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself. Conceptually, it's definitely different. It's not a zombie-ridden stereotype fest. It's not a cheap knockoff of another horror game. It's unique. It's almost like a genre that the game industry rarely taps into has come to life through this. The wonderful world of horror B-movies. Are they meant to be scary? Yeah, a little. Are they? Sometimes. But they're more than that. They're fun. They don't take themselves too seriously. Or they take themselves too seriously, to the point where no one else can take them seriously. That's kinda where this game falls, between those.\n\nIt's easy to see that this game is low-budget. It was developed by one man, and he's not a billionaire. This ain't Bill Gates. He's off in Africa somewhere carrying small African children on his back like a spider, trying to find the fountain of youth and wrestle lions that keep attacking his villages. This game came up from the streets. It's not a very pretty game. The art style works. But it's just not done very well. It's definitely dark, and atmospheric, and gets you in the mood to yiff ♥♥♥♥♥ with murderous robots. It gets the job done. But you can see visible warping in the environment as you move around. And you can't really move much in the game anyway, you're stuck in a room defending yourself from furries, so it's not like they had a lot of environments to design. The least they could've done was make the one room you're stuck in look nicer.\n\nAt the same time, the art style seems to help make the game. Something about the entire game's slightly off appearance makes it creepier. It invokes the uncanny valley feel, and in a way seems fitting when you consider it's a game about animatronics. Which are creepy as ♥♥♥♥ to stare at. Their lifeless, mechanically blinking eyes.... Its mouth, hinging and unhinging unnaturally, as it sings you Happy Birthday in a southern American accent... It's vile. Disgusts me in a deep, spiritual way. It's just wrong. Animatronics are just a crime against the greater good. Yes, this game is very personal to me. I stopped going to Chuck E Cheese a long time ago. We don't talk about it anymore.\n\nThe atmosphere and feel are done very well, as low-budget as the game may be. The core mechanics tie directly into the tense feel of the game. Or rather, mechanic, as there's only really one game mechanic. All you can really do in the game is check cameras, open lights, and close doors. You're a security guard locked in a room. You check your cameras to make sure you know where your horny robot friends are. If they're not where you can see them, you open your lights. If you don't ♥♥♥♥ your pants, turn off the lights. If you do, make sure you close the door or else you're dead. That's the game in a nutshell. Incredibly simple, yes. It's not a complex game. But there's beauty in subtlety and minimalist design. The fact that you have very little control over what's happening builds the tension. You're helpless in the truest of senses. All you can do to stop death is check to make sure it's not there, and if it is, close the door. And not only that, your defense is crippled even further by your limited resources. Everything you do will consume electricity. And should you run out, you suddenly can't do things anymore. Which leaves you at the mercy of the robots.\n\nIt's an incredibly tense game. It's paranoia-inducing, and drives home a sense of terror. And yes, when the monster gets you, he pops out and goes "Boo" like monsters do. Five Nights at Freddy's thrives on the jump-scare. Is that a bad thing? Yes and no. They definitely do rely on it. But jump-scares are a staple of horror. Everyone uses them. Do they use it a little too much? Yes. The game can be summed up with "I looked in the spot. The monster was in the spot. Nope. I'm not looking in that spot ever again. Let's just turn this game off and go take a long shower. Forever."\n\nThe jump-scares are done decently. They're adequate pay-off, but the tension is the best part. The stress, fear, and paranoia are the things that make this game great. Not the jump-scares. They're scary, yeah. But they definitely do bring with a little baggage. As the nights go on, you'll find yourself being assaulted more often. The patterns that the animatronics follow will get mixed up, and they'll be more active. A lot more tense when suddenly they're not where you expect them to be and actually right there in the room with you. But at the same time, dying much more often for the sake of difficulty can also be frustrating.\n\nA good jump-scare is like taking it up the butt. You can't rush it. You need lube, you need to go slow, and you need to be in the mood. No matter how ready you think you are, it's gonna surprise you when suddenly there's something in your butt that shouldn't be there. When done right, it's an enjoyable experience for everyone. But when suddenly it's happening too often, too fast, and when you're not in the mood, you're not gonna be happy. You're just gonna have ♥♥♥♥♥ up your butt and be very upset about it. That's how Five Nights at Freddy's starts to feel at the end. Not to mention the jump-scare is a little ridiculous. It sounds like a baby pterodactyl. Or maybe like you stuffed a box full of gerbils into a wood-chipper. But, as Five Nights at Freddy's sort of embodies the horror B-movie, I feel like how stupid it comes across as is really just part of the fun. No one is actually really terrified by the Killer Klowns from Outer Space. It's all part of the fun. The people tearing this game up about how "dis game is so bad, i showed babby and didnt even cry, 0/10 not scary, anoyone that older than 2 year old do not buy" miss the point.\n\nIf you can't appreciate the nature of a bad horror movie, this might not be for you. It's not a perfect game. It's clearly low-budget and gets by on cheap thrills. But to neglect the clever mechanics that promote paranoia and fear in unique ways because people enjoy it is stupid.\n\nIt's like watching amine. You don't tell normal people that you enjoy it. It's just a secret that you talk to your loser internet friends about. You can wear your Five Nights at Freddy's t-shirt in the safety of your own home. In your closet, when your parents aren't home, while you jack off to furry porn.\n\nI won't tell anyone you do it. It's okay.","January 24","true","2.2"," 63 of 95 people (66%) found this review helpful 48 people found this review funny","66","63","95","48","3"

Although it appears quite simple and even a little silly on the surface, what with Chuck E. Cheese mascots running amok, the actual game itself is very tightly made and exceptionally scary. I rate this above Amnesia and possibly even Silent Hill 2 for just how god awful it makes you feel.\n\nYour sense of paranoia escalates to levels I didn't even think possible. Your anxiety reaches new depths and the death scenes, even when you know they're coming after you suddenly remembered that you forgot to check the camera just outside your office, are bone chilling and are a rare example of a jump-scare that actually works and doesn't feel cheap!\n\nOnce you look past the surface and notice all the tiny little nuances, all the little minute sounds the characters make and even figuring out the hidden lore behind everything, you realise just how much depth this game has, and it makes it just that little bit more unsettling.\n\nOf course, this game wont be for everyone, but if you're the kind of person who likes horror games that tap into your sense of paranoia with a nice spoonful of dread for good measure, and you appreciate subtlety rather than all guns blazing (ala Dead Space) then Five Nights at Freddy's will push your buttons in such a way that you'll never want them pushed again for fear of heart failure.\n\nHighly recommended. Now my favourite horror game without question.","August 20, 2014","true","0.2"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos/recommended/319510/","astralchaos","Falem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos/","1065 products in account","Note: I got paid to write for reviews4views website.\nFive Nights at Freddys’ is a game about an employee who has to look after a pizza place that comes alive at the dead of night. As an employee of course you want to be paid so you're going to stubbornly stick to your seat and watch those monitors like a good lad and try to avoid dying. Surviving from 12 AM to 6 AM to get your paycheck sounds easy enough but it proves harder than it seems.\n\nThe animatronics start in the same locations every night, three of them in the furthest room and one in Pirate's Cove with a total of four animatronics to monitor it can become hectic when they start to separate. Though while I say there is four to monitor there is also goldy freddy to be careful of especially when the poster changes. Foxy the one from  Pirate's Cove is the most mobile of the four and will have you checking on him from time to time to make sure he doesn’t dash straight for you.\n\nManagement of your resources is utmost importance in order to survive the entire night, which also means not running out of battery. Battery is going to be your main weapon to fend off these animatronics. It’s used to not only lighten up the hallways to check if they are next to you but also to monitor their movement via cameras. This actually is well balanced to the degree where I had many close calls of nearly dying from running out but lasting just long enough to get the paycheck.\n\nI died several times on the first night, if it wasn’t for the fact I died I would be fired quickly for just being overall bad at my job.. Having tools to fend yourself helps but in a sense its only there to “delay” the jumpscare unless you make it to 6 am, if you are unable to the tension will explode from the building climax especially when the music box starts to play at 5 AM. The game is basically relays on your mind to play tricks on you and to build up fear for the “one” moment you know can come at any time especially if you let your guard down.\n\nOnce you beat all the nights there is a custom mode you can play to increase the ai of the robots up to 20. Which allows you to try the most challenging part of the game. At this point however your less scared of the game and more in it for the challenge of it all. You will most likely already establish a routine like many others have that helps you keep control of the situation and power manage the animatronics properly, so that you won’t be killed.\n\nThe overly major problem this game suffers really is ultimately finding a good routine will diminish the tension you had when you first started. Going into this game without a clue is really the best way to get value of it. Figuring it out step by step really gives it a better experience however once you get there the only real fun thing that remains is beating the custom night with all the AI on 20.\n\nThe premise of the game and the simplicity really make it standout and is quite accomplishes what it set out to do. The mechanics handle fairly well and are balanced to the point where you will see many videos of others and myself barely surviving the night multiple times regardless how well we try to balance our energy usage. The game is great for the tension that leads up to the jump scares though this diminishes towards the end and ultimately becomes about the challenge I still found the experience well worth the money.","December 30, 2014","true","4.2"," 37 of 51 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","37","51","5","4"

This game plays on that fear, and that is why this game is popular. I, however, do not have this fear. But this game has challenge to it. 4/20 mode took me EIGHT FREAKING HOURS to beat. But i did it anyway because i like challenges, and i will not stop until my mission is complete. Foxy has made me jump a couple of times, but i am not scared of this game. I just like the time consuming challenges of defeating this game.\n\nThose are my thoughts on this game.

Watching the cameras for the robots to move, whilst watching either sides is a MUST. If you aren't careful, one of them might come into the room. And game over. What do they do to you? I won't say.

Nobody over 30 would find this point-n-click scary. 2/10\n\nLONG VERSION:\n\nMy six year old hates scary games.  To put this into perspective, she thought the Super Mutants in Fallout New Vegas were too scary. The SUPER MUTANTS, for crying out loud.\n\nAnyway, I decided to see what all the hype was about, and I purchased this game during the Steam Monster Summer Sale for $1.  Booted it up one night about 10pm, beer in hand.\n\nAbout 10:30pm my six year old knocks sleepily knocks on the door: "Daddy, can I watch you play?" She should be in bed but I let her watch me sometimes when it's not a school night.\n\n"Sure, baby, come on in." She sits behind me on the couch, watching me through sleepy eyes at my desk.\n\nI say to her, "I think the game is too scary for you, I'm going to change it."\n\n"No, I like the bear and the duck" she says, soft and tired.  She's staring at the screen like she's waiting for a bus.\n\n"Are you sure? I can change it."\n\n"No," she says. I turn the sound down some, anyway.\n\nAnd I go back to the game.

Don't listen to the naysayers, it's more than just checking cameras and closing doors when bots get near you. You have to learn their patterns and habits, and you'll get mauled a bunch of times along the way. There is some randomness to the enemies, adding a bit of replay value, and after you've beaten the game you can make your own custom-difficulty night, including the very difficult 20/20/20/20 challenge, every animatronic set to maximum. The horror is mostly jumpscares, but the nature of the gameplay keeps you on your toes, especially when you lose track of an enemy and you wonder if you're about to get pounced.

This is a game you either like or dislike, that is obvious.\n\n"I am not a horror fan, I hate being jumpscared, I have actually played very little of any of the games in this extremely popular series. Yet I am a big fan of the series because like most fans like me, appreciate the lore of the games and how far the games have come.\n\nI mean this is a series created by a single near unknown developer and within 1 1/2 years has become so popular that there is now: 4 games, a spin-off title, a novel and a movie in the works. Along with billions of views on Youtube, a line of Merchandise and about a thousand knockoff titles.\n\nThis is exactly what happened with Minecraft! And that gets roughly the same about of criticism thrown at it.\n\nI agree that the fanbase is..... bad. But there is a large amount of it that are brilliant like the Theorists, Song writers, Youtubers, animators and artists.\n\nI know that i am going to get a lot of s*** from this review. But I dont really care, all I ask is for people to show a little respect for the little game that has changed not only the horror genre but gaming and gamers as a whole."\n\nOK with that clarified, Im going to start the review.\n\nIt's doesnt have the best graphics nor the best gameplay. But it is the story that keeps some players coming back for more.\nIt does have that initial scare factor, but it will wear off after an hour or 2 once you have learned the patterns.\nHorror fans will as i said either love it or hate it.\n\nIt is a good game, but it wont appeal to everyone. That is just how the industry works...\n\n","April 21","true","3.2"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","22","30","0","0"

I’m...finishing up my last week now as a matter of fact so...I know it can be a little overwhelming, but i’m here to tell you: there’s nothing to worry about, uhh, you’ll do fine! So...let’s just focus on getting you through your first week. Ok?” I thought oh how nice. At least this guy’s friendly.\n“uh...let’s see. First there’s an introductory greeting from the company i’m supposed to read. Eeh it’s kind of a legal thing, you know. ‘Welcome to Freddy Fazzbear’s Pizza: a magical place where kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. Fazzbear entertainment is not responsible for damage, property or person. Upon the discovery of the damage or death of the third, a missing person’s report will be filled within ninety days or as soon as property and premise have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached and the carpets have been replaced. Blah, blah, blah.”\nAt this point it started to get ominous. I thought: “What do you MEAN death?!”\n“Now that might seem bad, I know, there’s really nothing to worry about. Uhh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No! If I were force to sing...those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath? I’d probably be a bit irritable at night too. So remember: these characters hold a special place in the heart of children. You need to show them a little respect. Right? Ok.” It was at this point I fell in love with the animatronics and I even felt bad for them.\n“So just be aware: the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uhh, they’re left with some kind of ‘free-roaming mode’ at night. Uhhh...something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long. Uhh...they used to wander during the day too, but then there was the bite of eighty seven. Yeah...i-it’s amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, ya know?” At this point I got the chills. I froze with fear.\n“Now concerning you’re safety: the only real risk to you as the night watchmen here, if any, is the fact that these characters...uhh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won’t recognize you as a person. They’ll-they’ll most likely see you as a metal endo-skeleton without its costume on.”\nThis calmed me down a bit. I thought “Oh well that doesn’t sound too bad.”\n“Now, since that’s against the rules at Freddy Fazzbear’s Pizza, they’ll probably try to...forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazzbear suit. Umm, now that wouldn’t be so bad if the suits themselves weren’t filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area, so you can imagine how having your head forced inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort...and death. Uhh...the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth would pop out the front of the mask. ...Yeah they don’t tell you these things when you sign up...”\nAnd with this the fear was back. “WHAT?!” I screamed.\n“But hey! First day should be a breeze, I’ll chat with you tomorrow, uhh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power. Alright. Goodnight.”\nAnd with this the gameplay started. One of the first things I noticed was that I can’t move. That was truly terrifying. At least in other horror games you can run away from the things trying to kill you.\nI checked the cameras as I was supposed to. Everything was fine until 3 am. That’s when it really got ominous. One was missing. So the guy wasn’t crazy after all. I wasn’t really paying attention to him, though I did listen so I was lost.\nI figured it out but at four a.m. I experienced my first jumpscare: Bonnie.\nHe was the first one to kill me and because of that I fell in love with him.\nMy second jumpscare was Freddy. Freddy was just meh for me. He was just a big teddy bear for me.\nNext was Foxy. Oh man Foxy. I froze when I heard him bag on the door, and when he screamed bloody murder at me, I jumped back what felt like teen feet.\nI never did get Chica or Golden Freddy though.","October 17, 2014","true","0.8"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","17","21","6","0"

You will love this game, or hate it. But that depends on your subjective and partial view of it. FN@F was developed by Scott Cawthon using Clickteam Fusion 2.5 as engine. The controls are fairly simple, you only use your Left Mouse Button and there are only 5 interactive objects (well, 6, but that last one is a small Easter Egg played for laughs). You can't move from your position, and instead only look on your left or on your right. The basic mechanics are fairly simple too: your goal is to survive from 12AM to 6AM each night, avoiding being caught by the suspiciously free-roaming Animatronics. Easy? Well, yes, the first night is easy; after that, the difficulty increases exponentially each night, introducing new enemies and improving their AI, even actively adapting to your survival tactics. And of course, it's not only a matter of using the correct control at the right time: it's a matter of using them with moderation. Yes, because all you do requires power, and your power supply is limited. Very limited. You don't want a blackout occurring on the job.\n\nThis is Creepypasta material: NO SPOILERS, but the story is NOT a long one, but hell, when you realize it, good luck sleeping. It may require some maturity and sometimes patience to understand it. Some theories are still open.\n\nOne last thing: the game is priced 4.99$. If you think it's too much, you must be in a desperate situation and you have all my sympathy. So, for your information, there actually is a DEMO on Moddb. And it's Free.\n\nHowever, considering you have internet for reading this, supposedly a home and PC, electricity, water and I hope for you food, then 4.99$ shouldn't be too much for you.","September 10, 2014","true","1.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","11","11","4","3"

You have a limited amount of power and thus, very limited visibility while you struggle to decide if you want to keep the cameras/lights on or the doors kept sealed.First of all, I am really glad that I took the time to play Five Nights at Freddy's, even though it's not the type of game or genre I would normally go for, it turned out to be a lot of fun and actually pretty scary, even though you know what's coming after a couple of play-throughs, the game still has an ability to keep you on the edge of your seat.For a game with a simple premise and simple controls (monitor the cameras, click the doors or lights when needed), the game is immensely terrifying. There's no background music, save for occasional moments where the Toreador March plays (which, trust me, is not a good thing), leaving players to deal only with the background noises: the hum of the desk fan, the buzz of the florescent lights, the clattering in the kitchen, the footsteps down a dark hall, the dum-dee-dum of the characters... the silence, truly, is disturbing. Combine the simple controls, the nerve-wracking environment, and the lack of music, and within moments (and it's actually happening to me just recalling it) your palms are sweaty, your heart races, and every noise causes a panicked twitch.It's too bad that the franchise is way too over hyped, but it's still a good game!♥","September 12, 2015","true","74.0"," 33 of 52 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","33","52","6","6"

Do you like GOOD horror games? Don't buy this.\n\nOkay, before I rant on about this, let me say this: This review is in no way affected by the fandom, and I do not rate a game by it's fandom.\n\nFirst off, the gameplay. The controls feel awkward. This takes place in a first person perspective, right? In order to turn your head, you have to move the cursor to the different side of the screen. Which makes for poor sensitivity. Don't bring the controls of console FPS games to the PC, there's a good reason why console FPS games suck: There's a deadzone.\nAlso, the buttons, for the lights, are very awkward. In order to leave a light on, I'd expect to hold it, but no. You have to use it like a toggle. Sometimes, I find myself wasting power by turning and forgetting to click to turn off the light.\nOh, and the laptop, don't get me started on the laptop. In order to pull it out, you have to hover the mouse over it. Sometimes, if I move over to the other door to check, I accidentally pull the laptop out, then I "die".\n\nThe graphics look awful. Why is it that it looks like the background is just a wallpaper wrapping the inside of a tube. It looks distorted and disorienting. Also, even though the game plays in 1080p on my monitor, it looks like 480p.\n\nOne of the worst things in here is the lack of settings or pause. If you can't see crap, then too bad, you're going to have to deal with the automatic gamma correction. Need to take a crap in the middle of a game? Pressing ESC will only shut the game down.\n\nAlso, everyone says it's scary. I think the enemies look plain dumb. And if you happen to get screamed at by one of them, I don't get a heart attack, they just make me angry. It just plays the same old trope of something screaming at you from a poorly lit room. How original.\n\nI give it a 30%. It's terrible. Save your money and buy a better horror game, like System Shock 2, Doom 3, or I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. Those games are actually scary, and if you surgically removed their spookiness, they would still be fun.\n\nBy the way, I think the sequels are bullcrap too. They made so many of them in a short amount of time. Three games in seven months. And they all play similarly to each other. You know how people on the internet complain about Call of Duty having too many repetitive sequels released every year? Imagine if they done that for every 2.33 months. At least Call of Duty is somewhat fun compared to this garbage, by far I'd rather have CoD than FNAF. At least CoD has a redeeming factor for being a game: Gameplay. FNAF has neither of the two redeeming factors: Gameplay or story.","November 15, 2014","false","0.7"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

I've never played or saw a game like this, really did enjoy the game till the end and still enjoyning it. It still creeps me out, even though I find it funny to die here. The wait makes me nervous and let me look around and click the light button. When I see one of them approaching I am scared and try to click the door button to shut it fast down. When it doesn't work... Farewell cruel world. I gotta say Foxy is the least scariest creature here, he only looks from the door at you and screams unlike the other ones who are infront of you screaming. Still trying to figure out how to  how to beat the customized night at max difficult on all creatures. I think it is impossible to beat it on this difficulty, well atleast I died before it was 1 am always.\n\nNow the gameplay, it's easy to understand what and when you have to do and what you shouldn't do. Easiest creatures to avoid are Bonnie and Chica, since you see them infront of your door before getting killed. Last two obviously the difficult ones, Freddy and Foxy who can kill you without to stop at the doors. I heared there is a " Golden Freddy " which I never encountert. As I read, you can encounter him by watching the poster in the west corridor. It will be in your office and do nothing for seven seconds, then kills you and lets your game crash. Maybe it's a bug that it crashes or it is supposed to be like this, I don't know.\n\nAll in all, Five Nights at Freddy's is great for people who likes / loves jumpscares. I would say it is a kind of Tower Defense game without attacking something. It is good designed and well made. But sadly, it is a short game, it lasts like one hour - two hours, if you die often it could be longer. I would've like a longer version of this, even though the " customize night " is there, didn't entertain me long enough. Either I made it too easy or too difficult, which made me replay the whole six nights. To be honest, I would still replay the six nights because I can't change any difficulty and the calls at the beginnings, I liked it. So what are you waiting for? Go try the Demo and if you liked it get the fullversion.\n\nAtmosphere: 10/10\nDesign         : 9/10\nJumpscares : 10/10\nLength         :  4/10\nFun              : 8/10","August 20, 2014","true","11.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

Combine with lore that would make the Human Centipede frightened, and you have a recipe for success.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Five Nights at Freddy's is a point-and-click horror game that takes place in a Chuck E. Cheese-style restaurant, where animatronics are the main attraction. The four main animatronics (Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy) were allowed to walk around freely during the day, until an incident known as "The Bite of '87" took place, in which a customer lost his/her frontal lobe, due to a bite by one of the animatronics. After that, the animatronics were restricted to being able to walk around at night. You, as the night security guard, must watch the animatronics using a camera system, closing your doors when they get too close. If they find you, they will assume that you are an endoskeleton without a suit on, and will try to stuff you in a suit, killing you in the process. The difficulty of the game is that you have limited power, and anything you do (turning on lights, checking cameras, closing doors) will use up some of that power. If you run out of power, Freddy will come out and kill you.\nI would also like to point out the game's difficulty (for me, at least) as I have never made it past the 4th night. This might be because of my tendency to shut off my computer whenever an animatronic is at my door.\n\nSo that's it. If you couldn't tell already, I strongly reccomend this game to anyone, horror fanitics or casual gamers. The lore of the series alone is enough to keep me intrigued for a long time. Make sure to watch the Game Theorist videos, becaue they are amazing\n\n(Also, it says I only played 1.2 hours, but I usually play this game when I don't have internet. It should be about 4-5 hours.)","November 21, 2015","true","1.6"," 22 of 35 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","22","35","4","0"

If you can get past the increasingly cancerous fanbase and look at this game as a horror game, then you SHOULD be able to tell it's different for the genre.\n\nThe core objective of this game is to survive the onslaught of Freddy Fazbear, Chica the Chicken, Bonnie the Bunny, and Foxy the Pirate Fox. While the base game includes numerous jumpscares, the atmosphere is what truely gets me. The paranoia of just knowing that Foxy could charge your door at any given moment, or that Freddy may be lurking just around the corner. Just that instinctive feeling of knowing that you could be killed at any given moment by the animatronics somewhat petrifies me. The only thing saving you is your own wits and a door.\n\nI would 100% recommend this game to somebody who wants something different in a horror game. Great concept, decent execution.\n\n9/10.","May 23","true","1.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Choo Choo, all aboard the hype train! Final destination: your worst nightmares!\n\nI already posted a review of FNaF 2, so you can go check that one out if you want. I figured I'd just talk about what could easily be my game of the year 2014 and the biggest indie horror sensation since Slender (though far more deserving in my opinion). So is Five Nights at Freddy's really that good, or is it an overrated piece of non-scary garbage after all is said and done? Eh, considering you already saw my recommendation, you probably know my answer in advance. Ah well, let's get to talking about it.\n\nOn the surface, the story of FNaF is very simplistic. You play as Mike Schmidt, a nightshift security guard at a family restaurant called Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria that's based on Chuck-e-cheese. The mascots Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the bunny, Chica the chicken and Foxy the pirate fox are represented as animatronics, and though they appear innocent during the day, entertaining the children with songs and games, at night they roam around the restaurant and don't take kindly to any humans still around. Your goal is to survive five nights, from 12 PM to 6 AM (around 10 minutes in real time), avoiding getting your face rammed into an animatronic suit. Sounds fun, right?\n\nThe gameplay is refreshingly simplistic. Instead of moving around with a flashlight like in most indie horror games, you are stuck inside the security office. You can use the security feed to monitor the mascots throughout the restaurant, check the doorlights and close the doors should one of the aggressors get a bit too close for comfort. This would be a lot easier if you didn't have a limited amount of energy to manage. Everything you do uses power; using the cameras, keeping the doors closed and turning on the lights. When the power runs out, the building goes into a black-out, and it won't take long until Freddy gets his chubby bear hands on you. You can't close the doors all willy-nilly, you gotta do it when you really have to.\n\nBalancing is of course very important in every game, and FNaF handles it well. Foxy and Freddy force you to use your cameras while Bonnie and Chica require you to check your doors. In short, if you only use your camera, Bonnie or Chica will kill you, and if you never check your cameras, Foxy or Freddy will eventually get you without warning. There's a fairly competent difficulty curve, where new animatronics become active across the first few nights, and become more aggressive during the later nights. Unfortunately, with some very simple tactics the main nights become kind of easy. Even on the bonus night 6 it's perfectly possible to prevent Freddy and Foxy from even moving at all simply by watching them frequently enough. Yes, my main complaint about the game is that it's perhaps a bit too easy. Then again, Custom Night 7 allows you to make it as difficult as you want it to, so you could say it's a moot point. I just wish the main nights were just a bit more challenging.\n\nNow let's clear up a misconception I frequently hear about this game.\n\n"In Five Nights at Freddy's you're just waiting for a jumpscare to happen."\n\nThis is a rediculous statement. That's like saying "Super Mario Bros is just waiting until you get hit by a Goomba".  Unlike a lot of horror games, Five Nights at Freddy's uses jumpscares as a sort of punishment for failing. A succesful night will have virtually no jumpscares. You could say that the sound that plays when an animatronic appears in the doorlight is kind of cheap and pointless (FNaF 2 removed this), but they're not THAT bad. I prefer a screamer as a way to accentuate failure over one of those fake jumpscares common in horror any day.\n\nFNaF isn't all about jumpscares either. It nails other horror aspects exceptionally well. From the eerie dark ambient music that plays subtely in the background to the pitter-patter of the mascots on the move all around you. Weird circus music plays from an unknown source, mysterious knocking on the walls and children's laughter echoes through the halls. This game is filled with brilliant atmospheric sound design, and I'm a sucker for good sound in video games. I found the sequel lacking in this regard. Paired with the ominous dark rooms of the restaurant, the parts room being the most unnerving, and you've got yourself a highly immersive horror game that seems so simplistic at first glance.\n\nThe concept of having sentient animatronics as villains in a horror game is such genius I'm surprised it hadn't been done before. It plays off the irrational fear of mascots and animatronics a lot of people seemed to have when they were kids (and perhaps still do). I can't say I have the same sentiment for animatronics, since chuck-e-cheese is not a thing where I live, but I know mascots at theme parks unnerved me when I was young. I found Freddy, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy so fascinatingly terrifying from the moment I saw them, and they were the main reason why this game spoke to me, but Foxy sprung out to me. While the first three are designed to be creepy stalkers, Foxy is simply scary. With his sharp teeth and threatening demeanor, he evokes a more rational, primal fear, like you would fear a wild animal. Seeing him sprint down the hall towards you is comparable to being jumped by a rabid dog. His design and behaviour conveys it perfectly. He means you harm in more obvious way.\n\nI would say Five Nights at Freddy's is more than a game, it's a psychological test. How well do you handle stressful situations? Do you easily panic under pressure? Because the game totally punishes you if you do. When you start freaking out you make mistakes and lose track of what is really important. It feeds off your paranoia and kills you when you start losing it.\n\nHorror is extremely subjective, and not everyone will get scared by the same things. If it didn't scare you, that's a shame, but you can't deny that Scott Cawthon did a damn good job on this one, especially considering he did everything by himself. It's a game that has scared the pants off of thousands of people, reached cult status in mere days after its release, introduced characters that are already iconic, has a deep and dark storyline that sparked huge amounts of theories and has countless fans chomping at the bits to see more of Five Nights at Freddy's 3 in the near future. Oh, and it's fun to boot.\n\nFive Nights at Freddy's is THE new IP of 2014 that by far had the biggest impact on me and I can't wait to get some more of that goodness.\n\nI'm Ready 4 Freddy!","January 6, 2015","true","20.0"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","11","15","3","4"

There are a few Easter Eggs, most funny, and one lethal. The objective of the game is to hold off for 5 mandatory nights, as well as two that are optional following the completion of the fifth night. This game was based off of a Maryland pizza parlor, called Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, carrying the motto, "Where food and entertainment come to life," straight from the restaurant itself. The restaurant was closed down in 1987 and is still being investigated because of an animatronic coming to life and biting into the frontal lobe of what used to be (but she is still alive) a very happy customer.

Here's why:\n\nI love horror games. I do. I enjoy the thrill of being scared and all that, but this game is beyond scary. It somehow reaches into your brain and embeds an itch inside. An itch to look at the monitors. To make sure everything is in order. To make sure THEY didn't move. And if they did, pray to gods they are not coming for you. Gradually, it embeds in your psyche the CCTV picture of those terrifying, creepy THINGS, those... animatronics... and then when the image of their grinning faces with their cold, dead eyes is firmly in your head, it puts it right in front of you with a terrifying, mechanical scream! And then you have to turn the game off for a few seconds. Go back to the familiar desktop, check your pulse and decide it's too late to play this game. Then play it the next day, when it's no longer night time, when the sun is up and the room is no longer dark. But let me be clear - it's not just an any old jumpscare-fest we're talking about here, oh no no no. This is mastery of the expected-unexpected. The buildup of tension and the reveal are amazingly well executed. This is what I'm looking for in a horror game - even what seems like a whole lot of nothing terrifies you, brings you to a breaking point, and then, when you're most vulnerable, when you're starting to lose sanity, that's when it strikes. And it strikes hard. Not just in the sense that it's fast and loud, which it is, but in the sense that it's just uncanny. Creepy. You know that feeling when you stare into the bathroom mirror late at night and expect something to come out of the shower behind you? There is a split second moment when you're no longer certain which of your thoughts are real and which are just imagination, and that's when you decide to turn your eyes away from the mirror. Well, imagine if you looked away only to see your worst fears materialize right in front of your face, right there! That's how scary that game is. That's how it works. It messes with your head, brings the anticipation to a boiling point and then taps on your shoulder and screams in your face once you turn your head. Genius! Love it, but must not play now. Too dark.\n\nAll things considered, this game is a little gem. A little, shiny gem which reflects a dark figure standing 2 inches behind your left shoulder. It will test you. You will have nightmares. Consider yourself warned.","August 21, 2014","true","2.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

That's fine. What makes something "scary" is subjective, after all. Even if you don't have a fear of animatronics or don't react much to jumpscares, the one thing that I think we can agree on is this: The tension in this game is very high.\n\nManaging only one resource--power--seems simple enough but the room for error dwindles as the difficulty increases each night. Even if you know each character's behavior and how to monitor them, the speed with which you have to address them ramps up and you're bound to make more mistakes. Meanwhile, the atmosphere is doing its best to unnerve you to a higher degree as you progress. The noises in the game aren't so bad on their own but the last thing you would ever want to hear while checking the cameras is footsteps in the hall or Freddy's laughter, regardless whether or not they indicate an actual threat.\n\nThrow in some hallucinations and Foxy channelling Usain Bolt and you're almost done with Night 3.","September 13, 2014","true","0.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

For how it's made, it's not a bad game. It's not scary, truthfully, but the suspense keeps you on edge. You expect it yet you don't expect it. It's not a bad game at all.\n\n-Would I recommend this game? Naturally, given the jumpscares, no. But with how the game is designed, both in mechanics and visuals, I'd say yes. The game is comprised of a series of GIFS, not animated models like what we're used to today, this is more akin to older games. Very well done for that fact alone.\n-I sound like a broken record, but it does a good job of keeping you on edge, trying to determine which of the animatronics will pop up and from where. Bonnie and Chica, of course are fixed on sides, Foxy can come from either side and Freddy pops up when least expected under some occasions.\n-Even for each night lasting nine minutes, the suspense makes it feel so much longer.\nAnd the atmosphere adds to this. Eery.\n\nMy recommendation for the game, personally, is to add more background compared to the skimpy details observed on the walls. Storyline based details. News stories clipped to a bulletin board only take us so far.\n\nHopefully there will be an expanded sequel.","August 26, 2014","true","0.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

For all the negative reviews, I say you don't really have anything that says the game is bad, most of the time I see negative reviews that really say the game is frustrating and was not scary, now I don't really see a problem in that, but uh I really find it hard to believe you weren't scared. I see other things negative reviews say,  like it wasn't worth $5, some terrible immature joke bad interviews and like the such, and I hate how people say this game is a youtuber streamer trap, really? Why...ok, first of all, I have a youtube channel yet I uploaded FNAF but did I get popular? No! All I got were like 12 views. But uh, going back to the other things like this game isn't worth $5...dude...that's like...pocket change in the world right now and yet you're complaining this game is too expensive? HA what a joke. But going back to this game, I can say it truly made me scared and paranoid at the same time. This game is definitely worth your time and worth your money, the sequel deserves even better praise. Oh, and might I say this game was when Scott Cawthon (the creator) was very close on giving up onon the entire video game industry because the fact that critics for his other games said that his characters looked like scary animatronics.","December 27, 2014","true","2.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

No movement, no fancy mechanics. Simple point-and-click horror at its best. These monsters take the form of your inner childhood fears and stalk the corridors of a derelict pizzeria, eager to, without heistation, force your weak human form into a walking Iron Maiden and kill you in the most horrific way imaginable. One second they're there, the next, gone. But, always watching you.\n\nSimple mechanics. Open a door, close a door. Turn on a light, turn it off again. Open camera view, close camera view. Five Nights (give or take a few, if you play long enough) alone with 4 (5 *wink*) murderous animatronics. The question falls to you.\n\nAre you ready, for when Freddy comes for you?","September 20, 2014","true","4.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rusty_hammer/recommended/319510/","rusty_hammer","TMNT Super Fun Blast Party","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rusty_hammer/","69 products in account","Five Nights at Freddy's is an indie horror game made by Scott Cawthon. You have to survive 5 nights at a Chuck E. Cheese-esque place called 'Freddy Fazbear's Pizza'. What do you have to survive? Animatronics, yes, animatronics. The four main animatronics are Freddy, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy who all have different attack patterns; different ways to get to YOU. Here are some things that Five Nights at Freddy's does well: Making the player feel challenged: Five Nights at Freddy's starts out very easy but then ramps up the difficulty, especially in the later nights. Making the player feel helpless: Now, it goes without saying that if you were stuck in a place with 4 killer robot furries, you'd feel pretty helpless. And sense you're in a tiny office just waiting for you to get stuffed into a suit, it amplifies it. Fear: Five Nights at Freddy's will obviously be scary, right? Yes, it is scary. If you fail to stay alive through a night, you will be killed by one of the robots in a... jumpscare... "A cheap jumpscare? Really?" you might ask. Yeah, the deaths are jumpscares, but it isn't the jumpscare that scares you, it's not knowing when it will happen. If the death is predictable, then it isn't as scary.\nAs a final review for Five Nights at Freddy's, I give it a 9.9/10.","February 9, 2015","true","4.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

You can tell it is a robot furry yiff defense simulator because the fox is always the most hype to come for the booty.\n\nTime to rant, why could the company not afford a mechanic, if they were able to afford electro lock high tension spring actuated blast doors? I'm pretty sure I could hire a team of professional mechanics for the price of just one of those doors.\nJust sayin'\n\nPeople complain about the lack of settings, but if your computer is anything higher up than a blender hotwired to an alarm clock with the toaster expansion module then you should be able to play it just fine you whiners. (Hell, even I can run it.)\n\nBuy it now, cus it's better than RE6, it actually rustled up my jimmies, It's better than the DayZ, because this game actually has mechanics that work and an engine that isn't made out of a waffle iron.\n\nSo order now, and we wont send our animatronic butt pirate fox after you for further convincing!","August 22, 2014","true","3.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

You can watch Youtubers play it or your friends and it just won't give you the same feeling as when you play. What's that feeling? A quickly escalating scense that somethings about to happen to you. And when it doens't happen right away then the pressure just builds. The pressure is probably what makes this game the best. It adds to the already scary atmosphere, and makes you beg for Freddy to let you live until 6 A.M. This is defininately one of the best horror games I've ever played. This game is truely a masterpiece. If you like horror games or haven't played any and want to try them out, this is a great game for you! To top it all off, it's only 5 dollars!

The hugest problem is though that once you know how each animatronic move pattern the game can become a cake walk, however they change their patterns up each night. This ment I could pass Night 2-7 (4/20 mode) on my first try aslong as you follow a routine each night. A good thing to know before you play is that F2 resets the game but ESC quits the game.\n\nOn the overhand I don't recommend this game to anyone with a faint heart or is elderly as you will expect lots of jumpscares.

The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics, the awful gameplay. It is the equivalence of one of those crappy games you'd see on your web browser.\n\nWhy consider this a horror game? A sudden jolt of adrenaline from a jumpscare does not equal horror. Horror comes from the essence of fear, not a little scream that pulses you up for a couple of seconds.\n\nWhat's even worse, you may ask? The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fandom. It's cancer, pure cancer. It's scarier than this "horror" game.\n\nPeople have called me biased, and bigot. They say my reasons for not liking this game is good. Here it is, you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fanboys. So ♥♥♥♥ off.\n\nI'd advise you do not buy this ♥♥♥♥ game. I do not promote in anyway.\n\ninb4 "you have 12 hrs LOL!"\n\nEDIT: Do not buy the whole triology, to add.

You play as the night guard at a family pizzarea called Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Sounds simple enough... if it wasn't for the animatronics out to kill you. Your only advantages of defending yourself is using the sercurity camera to check on where the animatronics are, a light switch to see if anyone is coming to get you, and a door switch to close the doors, while dealing with a limited amount of power.
