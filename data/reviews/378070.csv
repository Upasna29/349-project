Seriously, if you've ever messed around in a Spiderman game, or just wanted a sort of parkour type arcade game, this game is so for you.\n+ Maps are large, expansive, and varried. There's tons of challenges to do, leaderboards to challenge others on, and hidden collectables. It harkens back to an older feeling generation of games.\n+ Tall skill ceiling, but very satisftying to learn. You will struggle at first, but there is always noticable improvement. And there is also always room to improve.\n+ Feels as good, if not better on mouse and keyboard as on controller, so don't feel as if you need a controller.\n+ Game just plays so well. It's a simple concept exicuted very well. The game's physics have improved since alpha and feel very satisftying.\n\nCons:\n- The game built by a single buy, and it does show. It is not hard to find yourself clipped between a pillar and a wall, unable to escape. Graphics are also not cutting edge.\n- Camera can be wonky, especially on controller.\n- A passable tutorial at best, I would say unintuitive. My advice is go into all the pillars in the tutorial level. They will introduce basic game mechanics. And try all the buttons to see what they do.\n\nThis is a game clearly developed by one man who loves what he does, and is very good at it. It is all apparent. This game harkens back to the old Spiderman games, as well as classics in general. It is very much a make your own fun sort of game. You have to know how to entertain yourself, even with the world challenges/leaderboards. A true open world game, with ideas exicuted well for this little seen parkour genre game. I would highly reccomend it to anyone who reads this and goes "hmm this game sounds enjoyable".","August 14, 2015","true","3.1"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

Which is great, because that's the important bit. There's no story, or combat. Just traversing maps with your abilities. Energy Hook was created by the man behind Spiderman 2's Swinging system. So that system is brought over into Energy Hook, reworked and improved.\n\nThe Hook line you shoot shortens as you wrap around poles, gets pulled back by building corners, can be shortened or lengthened as you swing. Needless to say, the amount of depth is very cool. You've also got a jetpack at your disposal. You can tap or hold the jump button according to how high you want to go. The game also gives you a boost ability, which will use the jetpack to propel you forward, whether you're soaring through the air, or swinging. To recharge the boost meter, you need to land on you feet. Either by running on the ground, or running on building walls. It feels badass.\n\nThere are multiple maps, all done by different artists. It's cool because they've got different art styles, as well as play styles. Each map also comes with racing challenges and trick challenges. The race ones are where its at, forcing you to do quick turns, tight entrances and fly make some huge swings.\nThe trick system is a bit dull in my opinion. There are two buttons you can use to do a small spin, or hold onto you legs. In combination with those, you can manually spin your character forwards/backwards, and sideways. Although you can combine stuff like that, it's not much. The more interesting tricks are when it comes to doing stuff like Loop the loops, where you spin around a pole entirely, or similar tricks.\n\nOverall, it's a great game. It might take a bit to learn how the game works, but when you get going, it feels incredibly satisfying.\n\nRecommended!","August 18, 2015","true","2.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","10","13","2","0"

Energy Hook is still in a state that looks and feels early in development. Putting this aside, it's already very fun to play. I backed it on Kickstarter and, as such, have some play time that's not displayed on Steam.\n\nEnergy Hook is a cross between Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Spider-Man, namely the second and best iteration of movie adaptations for the latter. Its developer, Jamie Firstrom, is the creator of the famed swinging mechanics in said movie adaptation, but if you've read anything about this game, you probably already know that. The reason why this is becomes apparent as soon as you hop in-game, as it is the single biggest attractive of this game.\n\nThe meat of the game is organized in different levels, each of which containing various challenges ranging from "time attack" to "highest score" style affairs. You move around by running on the ground (which was just updated to feel, well, good, finally) and swinging with your... energy hook. While in the air, you can perform tricks and, as expected, string along swings to produce the best scores possible, gain amazing speed and increase the rate at which your jump and boost meters refill. Hitting a nice sequence feels great, but be aware, there are many times where you'll find yourself in an endless string of colliding against various buildings and terrain. It might just be that I am awful at it, too.\n\nIt's fun. It's not at all perfect, there are still various bugs and the odd crash to desktop (in my case these are rare and often when exiting the game), the menus are rudimentary and performance on your machine may be iffy. It's fun though, and the issues that the game does have get significantly less relevant (or existent) with each update.\n\nAll in all, this game gets a "eh, yeah, why not, give it a try, it's pretty fun" from me.","October 21, 2015","true","2.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

With improved depth and realism, and mechanics the game successfully creates a parkour game that has such an amazing sense of speed and flow that even after completing all the challenges you will be booting up Energy Hook just to continue to fly around. If you like to explore open worlds and compete against leaderboard time trials at high speed swinging through the air, I highly recommend playing Energy Hook.","August 13, 2015","true","3.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

Here the experience becomes more like the Spider-Man 2 you may remember, as you can just swing about and have to care much less if you're in range for your hook. Exploration in this level was an absolute joy for me and it was where i spent the majority of my time. By contrast, levels 1 and 3 require more precision and didn't feel nearly as much fun to me, though to be fair i don't have a lot of practice yet.\n\nFrom what i've seen so far, the game still has plenty of room to grow, but it is already fun in its current state and has a lot of potential.

If you are a new player I would recommend that you take time to learn how to play before you discard it for "being bad or boring or hard". Once it clicks this game is amazing and my original review might be more relatable.\n\n\n\nTo me Energy Hook is a great "podcast game" - It's easy and satisfying to make your way across maps without really having to think about what you are doing.\nThis comes from the games perfectly executed core mechanic, the swinging. It is so light and intuitive that you will always be able to go where you want to go without being held back or having to struggle against the game.\n\nFor people that are looking for a bit more challenging gameplay there are missions where you can complete difficult courses and compete for highscores. However I would not go in to this game expecting it to be very hard to complete unless you want to be #1 on the leaderboards.","November 3, 2015","true","13.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I plugged in a controller and found things a tad easier, slowly getting used to swing around. At first you can't swing from things very far away which really makes the swinging seem like it's bad and more difficult than it actually is, but you just need to do a few challenges to increase that.\n\nAlso, get to the second level as soon as possible. This is where the game truly comes into its own and replicates that amazing Spiderman 2 swinging, even outdoing it. It took me about an hour to properly get to grips with the game but it was absolutely worth doing and I would highly recommend this - just stick with it throughout the dodgy start!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ARANimate/recommended/378070/","ARANimate","ARANimate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ARANimate/","214 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEnergy Hook is a fast paced, high flying, traversal game that is being made by the inventor the the swinging mechanic from Spider-Man 2.\n\nIt took me a bit to get use to how the game controls. It was frustrating and I couldn't imagine trying to play with a mouse and keyboard. Luckily, my handy Xbox One controller worked perfectly well. You control your character via 3rd person and can jump, boost, and swing to complete each time trial or task.\n\nIt was actually rather frustrating until I decided to start messing with the settings. Buried in the settings is the ability to turn off "simulate wrap" or something to that effect. What would happen is when you were swinging the game would predict that direction the swing would take you and automatically turn the camera for you. By turning off this setting you are able to use the right thumbstick to manually turn your character and easily point in the direction you'd like to set up your next swing point.\n\nOnce you get going the game feels fluid and does remind me of the web swinging in Spider-Man 2. I would love to see a better tutorial down the road, however, as with most early access games you should take it to the forums for the time being. Tutorials aren't high on priority lists for games this early in development and is wasted time, especially if things are going to change.\n\nThe game is set up in levels with different color portals that indicate start points for different time trials throughout the stage. You walk up or swing over to the portal, step in and it will start the trial. You must swing and boost through rings in the order that they appear, trying to do it as fast as you can. There's also a leaderboard although I admittedly didn't take too much of a look at it.\n\nYou can really see what the developer is going for here. The proof concept is strong, the swinging mechanic is working well, and the gameplay is moving in the right direction. However, there is still a lot of work to go and the developer will be the first to tell you. Looking at the forums the dev has posted a lengthy Google doc with over 100 fixes in the works, ranging from bug fixes to gameplay changes. Having a developer dedicated to a project is key, so consider that when deciding to support a project.\n\nThe game is also a little pricey for where it is in the development coming in at $17.99 (Currently on sale for the random 12% off). I don't think this is a wholly poor decision though. Pricing a game like this will make sure the right people are supporting it and the feedback the developer will receive will be of a much higher quality. I usually scoff at such highly priced early access games, but that's usually for games with heavy multiplayer content where the price creates a barrier of entry for something that needs a lot of players for testing.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wiJ1PPTBdbY\n\nOverall, Energy Hook has a great mechanic backed by a seemingly dedicated developer.\n\nFor more Reviews, Videos and the Bi-weekly Indie Game Podcast\nEarly Access Media[www.earlyaccessmedia.com]\nEarly Access YouTube","August 18, 2015","true","0.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Right now it's kludgy and awkward, but after a few months of polish ironing out some of the stuff I've outline below, this game will be so fun.  Getting into the abstract shapes outside of a city would be so fun.\n\nThere's not enough vibration for the controller. I'd expect the controller to vibrate on boosts sure, but then whenever a web is connected, whenever I press down on the jump button, and whenever I hit a wall. This could be the biggest thing missing beyond the animations.\n\nThe web should be bend a little, it seems like it's always in a perfectly straight line. You'd think there'd be a bit of a bend in front of you as you get pulled along, and then chasing behind you a little bit as gravity takes over entirely.\n\nThe tricks seem like they only make you go down, in the interest of building up boost, it's too much negative reinforcement, I'm looking to stay up in the air, and doing a straight X or Y trick costs me way too much height.\nIt's not obvious that Up and Down on the D pad is supposed to rotate you, since you can't be moving the analog stick at the same time. It makes sense once you know, but its frustrating to spend time to figure it out.\n\na lot of the time my web cuts on on me and its not immediately clear to me why not. I'm assuming that the angle got to sharp or I turned around a corner, but having some sort of feedback on why that's happened would be nice.\n\nAnother place to add vibration too, wire tension. This is probably a big reason why the game feels so strange. Half the time I boost in a small space the web gets broken and I don't understand why. Its more negative reinforcement of the boost button.\n\nHaving an instant reset or at least kill button. I don't want to watch my ragdoll fly around for 3 seconds at a time, I'm looking to get back swinging asap.","August 28, 2015","false","1.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

It's an indie game, and the mechanics are solid!\n\nIt takes a bit to figure out, and the game doesn't really hold your hand, but once you figure out all mechanics and you get your swing down you will have a blast soaring around. If you're the type that played Assassin's Creed or Prototype or Spiderman (or any of those sandbox-type games with creative movement controls) and you found yourself wasting hours and hours just running/jumping/flying/tricking around and seeing what kind of crazy moves you could pull off instead of playing through the story, this game is for you! You get this incredible sense of freedom and speed, and it really is beyond satisfying to swing and fly yourself from the streets up to the top of the level's tallest tower.\n\nIn addition to free play in each level, you have a host of challenges to choose from. In addition to in-level challeneges, there are also VR challenges (i.e., no big level; just a challenge course) you can find in each of the main levels that are a great way to learn the ropes...honestly I would love to see a VR set of training levels to start you off and teach you the ropes, but knowing how long and hard Mr. Fristrom has worked on this already, I completely understand if that never happens.\n\nA couple tips for beginners to get good as quickly as possible:\n\n1) Unlock the second level (Southstar Island) ASAP as it's a much better environment to learn to link a bunch of swings together IMHO.  It's much bigger and much more uniform, so you can really get the mechanics down. You can do that by doing just a few challenges in the starter Gravship Dock level.\n\n2) You aim your energy hook left/right with the left joystick, not the right. Once you figure this out the whole game opens up. This realization took me longer than I'd like to admit :)\n\n3) When you're just starting out, instead of relying on the momentum of swings alone, throw in a jump/boost at the end of each swing to keep you high in the air and keep your speed up.","October 26, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its probably the best swining mechanics in any game ever made.","October 26, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
