Even now, more than 20 years after its original release, it still holds its ground as a good, solid game. True to the era it's from, the game consists of four episodes which you can play in any order you would like.\nEmulation software is included, so in most cases you don't need to do anything special in order to play it.","May 5, 2015","true","4.2"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","30","32","2","0"

You run around killing monsters to collect the globes on each level to progress, and there's nothing more to it.\n\nA timeless classic, choc-full of nostalgia for somebody like me. I really am glad I got to experience this on Steam and revisit my childhood. I highly recommend this, to anybody who loves Apogee and gaming in the 90's.","May 15, 2015","true","5.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

However, does the game hold up to current day?\n\nPros:\n-Brilliant writing from Tom Hall, the man behind Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, Rise of the Triad, and Anachronox\n-Simple gameplay that is easy to grasp\n-Fantastic pixel art graphics with interesting environements and monsters\n-Four episodes with distinct end goals\n-Some great retro PC music\n-Interesting boss fights\n-Lots of in-level secrets\n\nCons:\n-Movement in general is somewhat jerky and jumping takes a while to get used to\n-There are only really 5 types of enemies: projectile enemy, charging enemy, flying enemy, flying downward projectile enemy, flying sideways projectile enemy.  The rest are all reskins of one of the above\n-Occasionally reused level tilesets are letdowns\n-While simple, the gameplay becomes tiresome if taken in large doses- can become repetative!\n-Switch puzzles are lazily designed and are only defeated by trial and error busy work\n\nAfter revisiting the old classic, do I still find it to be up to par with how I originally felt about it?\n\nHalf and half.  The game's repetitive nature betrays it more in the modern day than it had previously, but the interesting environments, witty writing, and gameplay that I just generally find to be fairly fun, possibly out of nostalgia.  Without the tilesets and interesting monster designs it is entirely possible that I wouldn't give this game the time of day; however, as it is I would recommend this game given that you're a fan of DOS platformers.","August 12, 2015","true","0.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

So, after many years, what's it like coming back to it, and finally being able to play it through the end? Well, let me say, it brought my childhood back! Hocus Pocus still holds up as a solid platformer even after all these years, with some very good level design (as well as great backgrounds for the different areas), a great retro soundtrack, and a lot of variety in enemies.\n\nAs many games back in the day, most (if not all) levels include secret areas, and after each level you get a bonus if you collect all the treasure, which encourages you to explore; not to mention there's also wizards spread around some levels with interesting (and sometimes funny) comments regarding your situation.\n\nAs far as the story goes, it's quite simple; you're a wizard trying to prove yourself to your superiors, and to the love of your life. Even then, it's a good story, although it exists mostly in the form of text after you beat each chapter.\n\nSo, to conclude, I'd say this is a worthy platformer. Even though it's quite retro already, it's nice art-style might make it easier for new people to get into it, so go ahead and give it a try.","February 17","true","4.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Depending on what type of computer you are using, this Steam version may not work. Otherwise I'd recommend either two things: 1) follow community boards on fixing the aspect ratio problem upon game-launch 2) Buy this game from GOG.com (no issues with that version.)\nThe verdict: Don't waste your money on Hocus Pocus from Steam.

Like most Apogee titles of the time, I'm pretty sure the best content was in the first part (Also released as shareware) to get people to mail them $34.95 (plus $5 shipping and handling, of course). Still don't let that stop you from buying this. Go ahead and buy it, I think Apogee needs it since I don't think anyone mailed them their $40 back in the day.","September 24, 2015","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This was my introduction to platformers. Not at all a bad introduction -- looking back at it over twenty years later, the 2D art and music remains effortlessly charming. The game's many chapters and levels take place across an abundance of distinct themes, which keeps the simplistic gameplay from growing stale.

The game's biggest flaw is its level design, which is quite bad and relies a lot on repeatability (jump on a platform above some lava, kill enemies on another platform, jump to that other platform, kill enemies on the next platform, repeat a lot more times - as an example). Also, enemies are mostly the same in comparison to each other, there's very little variation, many of them have the same behavior while only looking different.\n\nEven then, it's still good, classic platforming fun with some challenges to beat. Apogee has made some much better games but this is still worth playing.","December 18, 2015","true","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, no effort has been put into this - it just runs in DOSbox, which is how I was running it anyway!

I actually own the original floppy disk of this, so its not like I was even worried about having a legal copy.
