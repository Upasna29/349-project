It's still the same fundamental problem that there is a progressive framerate decrease over the course of a level.  The longer it goes, the lower the FPS drops.\nI never had it drop as low as it was previously and actually managed to complete two more levels, but its still frustrating to play at this moment.\n\n\noriginal:\nAt present its broken.  Game will drop to 2-3 frames a second.   I cant play past the 3rd level, even when nothing is happening the frames wont go back up.   Its mentioned on the forums, but Dev seems to imply that its just everyones computers eventhough the reqs arent anything special.","May 19","false","1.5"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","22","29","2","5"

Too short, far too short. Not a lot of replay value either as there is nothing else you need to unlock, no need to change your weapon layout ….

My only major gripe with it is that the difficulty curve is pretty easy for most of the game with only one or two attempts at each level needed... until the last level. Then, possibly for lack of more content the difficulty is turned up to impossible. There are no more upgrade options left for my weapons and I've tried a number of configurations on the ship (all lasers looks cool but the game slows down to a crawl with them all firing).\n\nFor what it is I'm happy to have paid 99p in the sale, its just a shame it doesn't go on for longer with a few more interesting options. I'm reccomending this purely on the fact that I enjoyed the 1.5 hours I spent on it but I probably won't be playing it again.","May 22","true","1.5"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Its challenging and satisfying and plays similarly to the the browser game "Orbital Decay", which is quite a good thing.  There are a couple minor problems (spelling errors and somewhat repetitive sounds) and one major issue:  In the later levels with more enemies and more advanced turrets the game tends to slow way down to about half its normal speed and stay that way regardless of what happens on the screen until you return to the menus.  This leads to much slower and less fluid gameplay as well as surprisingly long breaks in the action.  This really needs to be fixed before I wholly reccomend the game.  The only other thing I can really say is that its really short (only seven or eight levels) and could probably be completed in an hour or two.","May 17","true","1.5"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","2"

Known for masterpieces such as Flesh Eaters, Neon Hardcrops and Kivi, Toilet and Shotgun (!). He is from Romania and is a former member of Iron Guard.

It's the only way. I'am not attracted to guys and not into homo relations, but he is something different. My love for him is beyond limits. I really wish he will reply to me here... I'm so lonely... I really want to touch his ***** and play with his *****. I see the best version of myself in him. I think, if he just once, just one time, wink at me or smile at me, I will be the happiest and most satisfied person in the existance.\n\nThat's all I have to say. Good luck Popa.

You start out in the standard spaceship with only the laser you the player controls without any turrents. Your told that you don't have enough firepower to actually win the current level your on and that you should try and get some turrents. Thats kinda hard since you dont start off with any money and you cant add turrents mid battle. So the first level starts you just have the lazer you control which is pretty ♥♥♥♥ and you end up getting absolutely obliterated by the enemy faction the hunters. After the end of the level you realize you got some money and you can just barely afford a weak turrent you buy one and play the first level again. You get obliterated but gain some more money buy another weak turrent. Have another go at the first level get obliterated gain some money. Rinse Repeat Rinse Repeat and thats pretty much Cosmic Dust & Rust: playing the same level over and over again until you can actually beat it.

The main idea of the game is to travel in space with the ship, and to defend yourself from the enemy ships. The music makes you to feel like you are playing an old school game, awesome soundtrack. You start with only one turret, you can't pass the first planet without doing some upgrades or buying some new defense guns, lasers, turrets, rocket launchers etc., and you need some skill, it's not that easy to hit all the enemy ships and win. The game has some tasks, when you finish the task you get a reward, like energy, money and aluminium so you can upgrade your weapons. It's addictive, you want to destroy more ships, to get more energy, to travel more, to reach the next planet. Main problem of the game now, it's that starting with the second half of planet two, the game become a bit unplayable, 5-10fps drops, but the dev is already working on that.\nPer-total, it's a great game, addictive, and worth a shot.","May 22","true","2.0"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nardio_net/recommended/473560/","nardio_net","bme85","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nardio_net/","35 products in account","Cheap but not worth it.\n\nSure it's under 2 bucks, but the gameplay here is just bad. Six levels in total, five of which look exactly the same. I have yet to experience the sixth. No tutorial at all or help at all. When I first started playing I went to the in game story to look at weapons and power ups but had no in game currency to get them. So I jumped into level one expecting a tutorial and a way to make money. Maybe I would get weapons there. Nope.\n\nThe only in game text in game happens during gameplay and is for the most part distracting and pointless. My first play through had me distracted reading text as tiny unbelievably hard to see little black ships snuck up to my ship and started attacking. Lots of them. I tried fighting them off with the main cannon but it wasn't enough. I found I wasn't able to summon cannons so I figured I had to play through the level with just my player controlled cannon. The in game text mentioned that the crew was working on adding guns for me to use and I just had to hold off the enemy forces...So I tried again being sure to pay attention. Sure enough again There were just to many to kill with my cannon. I couldn't figure out how to equip my other guns in game. It wasn't until after my third waste of time/play through of level one that I went back to the main store and sure enough I had enough money somehow to buy weapons for my ship.  I guess the developers had the idiotic idea that players should grind level one then know to go to the store and buy guns/equip them so they can beat level one.\n\nReally?\n\nOne negative review of the game on Steam said it best:\n\nBought it for $1 on sale. 30 seconds in to the first level there are too many NPC's and my gun is disabled. Ships 1/100th the size of yours need 5 shots to destroy.\n\nSo my  first play throughs were pretty much you wasting time and earning money. This sets the tone for the game.\n\n\nDirectionless and cheap.\n\nI had to grind this way to beat level 1.\nRepeat grinding several times for level 2.\nRepeat again for level 3.\nRepeat again for level 4.\nRepeat again for level 5.\nGet stuck on 5 after repeating to many times.\nWrite this review and delete this crap.\n\n\nWeapons have no explanation of what they do and how much they hit for. You can barely see their specific shots in game so it's kind of a guessing game as to what to do. Later on I found out after grinding a bit that I could upgrade my guns a bit. They do better, but you still need to grind like crazy to make it through the later levels. It felt bland and empty. After all that frustration now, I won easily. Sure it was nice being able to get through some of the early levels easier, but it was still a grind and me fighting the same few ships over and over again.\n\nLevel 5 has been my wall. Try, die, upgrade, try again, upgrade, try again and upgrade. This isn't fun. I've gone to the forums to check out what works and apparently the answer is all green lasers.\nReally?\n\nThen I'm reading all green lasers got nerfed.  So thats not working.\n\nReally?\n\nI'm not in the mood to replay the game a few dozen times more to max out my ship parts to then hit a wall to try and figure out which nondescript weapons will work on clearing the final two levels. That's pointless grinding and time wasted. You need to buy each weapon and pay to upgrade them each time in game. So in theory if there is a magical set and arrangement for these nondescript weapons I need to replay and grind this crap game over and over again as I buy, upgrade and try them over and over again and see what allows me to survive the onslaught.\n\nNot fun.\n\nAny way lets go into a bit on the very deceptive description for this game:\n\nCosmic Dust & Rust is a tower defence game set in space. Upgrade your ship, build turrets and defence systems, undergo side missions and take control of your ship manually and use its cannons and super weapons to destroy your enemies.\n\nSo Cosmic Dust & Rust is a sort of tower defense game. You have ship and over time you can equip guns and upgrade everything on it.\n\nNow "undergo side missions" is a bit of a misnomer. You don't. While you play the game you earn in game currency just by playing it. It's called "Side Missions" but it's really just the game keeping track of various set objectives that are about how much of so and so you kill or how often you use so and so skill. There is no real, leave the game campaign behind and do a side mission here.\n\n"and take control of your ship manually and use its cannons and super weapons to destroy your enemies."\nThis one. This one here is what hooked me.  I thought this was going to be me manually piloting my ship some how and having an active role in how the level is played out..... No... Not really. In Cosmic Dust & Rust from the very first level you are in control of the ships main cannon. This is normal gameplay. Not "and take control of your ship manually" as if it were bonus play on top of the normal tower defense formula here. Later on you can use two special skills to help you further along. But the game never shows you how to use said skills. I bought and installed the ion cannon and the shield and didn't figure out how to get them to work until level four when I started tapping random keys out of frustration. 3 & 4 on my keyboard all of a sudden became useful. The cool down on these are painfully long frustrating. I wouldn't say using these power ups and the ships main cannon count as something unique here. It just feels like regular active gameplay in a tower defense game. This isn't anything new nor is it me taking control.\n\nSo far I've spent over 2 hours playing Cosmic Dust & Rust and it feels like a colossal waste of time. This is sorta like a masochistic flash game that feels like it was released midway through development. From what I read in the earlier reviews the game was short but enjoyable. I could do that. Then some reviews were saying that it just didn't have the amount of content to justify the asking price. Since then the developer has updated the game and I think I am playing the boring and grindy results. Instead of adding more levels and fleshing out the game, they just made it harder.\n\n\nIt's six frakin levels.\n\n\nWhy do that to a six level game? This is made in GameMaker. It's not hard to make new levels in GameMaker. Hell just copy paste some levels and adjust the amount of ships and call it a day. It not like the levels here stand out at all or there are unique sequences of events. It's an enemy wave defense game with ships that all look alike and blend together. Put some more effort into this.\n\nI could go on, but this is just frustrating. I was really hoping the developers of Cosmic Dust & Rust would listen to the reviews and comments on the Steam store, and then I came across this comment.\nconradproteus  [developer] May 21 @ 4:12pm\nFor 2$ what did you expect? we are indie and we tryd to get some funds from this so that we can make sequal with more features and content\nSo instead of making the best game they can, they just wanna up and abandon it for a better sequel.\n\nScrew this game.","May 28","false","2.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I'm only on the third planet as of now (I'll update this as soon as I beat the game), but so far, this has been quite the experience. It's worth more than the measly $2 you'll have to pay. This game offers lots of fun and satisfaction as you manage to beat a level.\n\nI only have two small issues- there is a bit of lag if things get crazy on-screen, but it's only minor. It could be improved though, because when it lags, the cursor lags too, which makes it hard to aim properly. The second issue is the options. In my opinion, there's not enough options to get to customize your game. For example, there could be a quality option which allows you to switch between high quality and low, or the ability to change the mouse sensitivity, etc. Also, you guys should move the 'New Game' button to a different spot so we don't accidentally click that when trying to click 'Continue.'\n\nBut like I said, those are minor. If you're looking for a really fun game to pass the time, this is without a doubt a great game and you'll find yourself drawn in after learning how everything works.\n\nNow, if you enjoy games with upgrades and such, this will also be for you. There's tons of upgrades that you can buy with in-game money and Aluminum. You can also buy more guns to support you with fighting off waves of enemies. I'll go into more detail after I have beat the game.\n\nPros:\n-Cheap (only $2!)\n-Easy to learn\n-Upgrades\n-Challenging\n-Exciting\n-Nice graphics (reminds me of Flesh Eaters :P)\n-Amazing devs\n-Nice music\n-"Side-quests"\n-At least two hours of gameplay\n\nCons:\n-Slight preformance issues (small frame rate drop when there's lots of enemies on-screen)\n-Needs more options\n-'New Game' needs to be moved\nSo, right now, I'm giving this game a 9/10. It's a solid game with lots of potential for updates and such, and the small issues can easily be overlooked.","May 17","true","2.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

You have to build and upgrade turrets on your ship in order to beat the much harder levels.

It's worth the few bucks to kill a bit of time and if the devs add content or make a longer second game it would be something I would be interested in.\n\nThat being said, my major gripe with this game is the ships AI targeting.  I don't know if it's intentional to add difficulty, a bug, or just not smart.  In the last planet is where it becomes the most noticeable, and that's being the turrets target ships before anything else.  There will be large bases with turrets on the north/south side of my ship, just pummeling everything directly beside my craft.  Yet all my guns will be firing at the edge of the screen to kill the ships just coming into range/view.\n\nWhile I would have finished this game 35-40min, a fair length of enjoyable time for $1-2, because of this poor AI reaction I've been sitting on the last planet for 20-30min alone.  With a fully upgraded ship at this point I can just barely get to the end before I cannot keep up with the stations flying by without the help of the turrets to destroy the other stations turrets.

That being said I have only one real problem with the game and that is the lag. After the first stage of the game as soon as it ramps up it slows down so bad that I thought it froze on me. When you consider the graphics of the game it should now cause any computer playing it to stop or slow at all.\nThat being said I still recommend this game but please fix the slow down effect that comes with playing it.","May 25","true","7.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

Takes less than an hour to reach the last level but that's fine given the pricing. Has that addictive flash game quality, where everything is pretty simple and you just play it through to upgrade everything.\n\nThe negatives listed aren't actually all that big a deal, the only REAL issues I had with the game is I felt like it could have been stretched out a bit, even if that just meant recylced content.  Chuck in a few more levels and upgrades, and let the players upgrade to the point where the last level is easy. Games like this only have difficulty depending on what upgrades you have, since there's very little you can do to manually increase the effectiveness of your ship.","May 27","true","1.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
