Spoiler-tags are used liberally, and I'm not going to bring any big spoilers into the review whatsoever--I want you to experience the game on your own!\n\nThe demo is free from MangaGamer, and is roughly 2 hours in length.Really, just try it.\n\nThis isn't a nukige.Nukige being defined as a game where the plot only exists as a vehicle for sex. If you're looking for graphic content, this is probably not the game for you.\nSpoiler includes the length of time before reaching the first 'erotic' scene:15 hours\n\nThe game has partial Voice-ActingHow partial? Well... about a fifth. From my estimation (not looking at raw files, but simply from my experience playing the game...) it seems to be somewhere around five to six hours of voice acting. That's more than any single season of anime will have, anyway. All of the funniest, most exciting, or most painful moments are acted--it is a slight disappointment that it all isn't, but, they made sure they got the most out of the performances, and they are well-done.\n\nThis game has a full SoundTrack.They're somewhat modest about mentioning it, but there are over a dozen tracks, not including the opening and ending. Their usage and application in each and every scene are great and help reinforce the writing and bring it to it's fullest emotional potential. Some of the tracks you WILL connect to emotionally by the end.\n\nThe game has roughly 25 hours of content.There's more details about this throughout my review, but, putting it here as well. After getting the 100% completion, I had spent 26 hours myself.\n\nThis is mostly a kinetic novel.There are some choices to be made, and some alternate scenes and dialogues to be had, but you're mostly along for the ride. There is some non-linear experience, and plenty of perspective changes, but the story is pretty much set. There might be an alternate ending--I don't know yet though, and its definitely something you should experience for yourself! Gameplay is mostly just taking the story at your own pace, and choosing what parts you want to see first.\n\n\n\n\nI played the demo before playing this game--it's available from the developer's website and is roughly 2 hours in length (at least, for my reading/emotional engagement speed)\n\nI played the game immediately upon release from the developer's website, some many hours before the official Steam release. I slept around 4 hours after making it through a decent bit, and then finished it. I imported my save into the Steam version by simply copy+pasting the save directory.\n\nI spent 19 hours playing through the main scenario after speeding through the identical demo scenes, leaving me with a 21 hour playtime. After completing the main scenario, extra scenes were interspersed throughout--a large amount, actually. I would estimate at roughly a quarter of the main scenario in length--you're getting closer to 30 hours than 20 with this game, at my speed.\n\nEDIT2: I finished all of the extra scenarios. They are VERY numerous (78 in all!) and well written and fill in every gap. It took me an additional 5 hours to read them all, so that raises my time spent to 26 hours before full clearing the game. And even if the main scenario is over, the extra scenes are VERY much worth your time.\n\n\n!!NOTE!! This review is a work in progress. This concludes my fact-based guide. I will be updating this review with my full thoughts on the game shortly. It'll be pretty long, so I'm writing a TL;DR (even though you can't read it yet...)\n\nTL;DR: This game is an amazing piece of media, of fiction, of art. Of love, of what love is, and the hardships that come with love... well-written characters that are engaging, genuinely funny jokes and seamless localization. Kindred Spirits on the Roof is a bittersweet treasure.","February 12","true","12.9"," 247 of 263 people (94%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","94","247","263","10","4"

Two ghosts rope MC into playing yuri cupid for various couples in the school so that the ghosts can spy on them and learn how to make love to each other, as girls—yes, this is morally questionable no matter how you word it—but despite this, the story is not centered around sex at all.  Really.  It took me around 12 hours to reach the first nsfw scene, and all the way up those 12 hours, the story focuses on developing relationships, emotional connections, friendship.  Rather than sex being the focal point of the game, it feels very much like a beautiful culmination to everything that couple has experienced together up to that point—from the confessions, to the trials and tribulations of trying get their love reciprocated, their sense of stability after ironing out misunderstandings.\n\nAlso, while the whole “b-but we’re both girls!” may seem excessive at some points, homosexuality in Japan is still very much condemned.  But that’s one of the most refreshing things about this game: not only does the story touch upon real issues like social stigma and family expectations, but it also doesn’t write off the girl/girl romances as just a phase, like so many other works in yuri genre do.  One couple in particular discusses and plans their future together in the face of a homophobic society, and that really resonated with me.\n\nAs someone who has also tried out the Sono Hanabira series, which oversexualizes girls (and even glosses over the fact that one of them is a huge age gap student/teacher lol), I am very happy that this game doesn’t treat homosexuality as a joke or something just to fetishize.  I really felt like the story was reaching out to girls in similar situations, living in fear of condemnation yet still brave enough to face their feelings and look forward to a brighter future.\n\nSetting aside my accolades for the story, the voice acting, art, and music are also superb.  The nsfw scenes are very tasteful, and despite the fact that the OST is about 12/13 tracks, the songs are catchy enough that I never felt bothered by it.\n\nConclusion: if you love girls, love girls loving girls, love a good story, please get this game.  It’s $30, yes, but there’s around 30 hours of gameplay, so it’s well worth the money.  You won’t regret it.","February 16","true","50.1"," 197 of 211 people (93%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","93","197","211","14","3"

Notably, there is absolutely zero fanservice or gratuitous sexualization of the exclusively female cast in this game. Instead, the characters are interesting, well-designed, and thoughtfully written.

There really isn't much to say about the game since it's pretty straightforward and full of fluff for you to discover. The premise is very simple though - Toomi Yuna assists two "kindred spirits" (yurirei, a play on words that literally translates to lily spirits or otherwise known as lesbian spirits) on the roof in hooking lesbians up at her school. Everything is very lighthearted and soft though. But don't forget this game is 18+ for a reason...\n\nIn any case, if you are looking to buy this game, be aware that some parts are not voiced in this game, so that MAY take away from your experience. Typically, introduction scenes (for new characters and the whatnot) and important ones (romantic CGs, certain scenes, etc) are voiced, but the common chitchat scenes are not voiced.\n\nI would recommend this game for anyone who likes visual novels in general and is appreciative of the yuri genre.\n\nYuritopia Simulator 2016 is a go!\n\nEDIT: WOW, after playing through the entire game, I feel absolutely compelled to play it all again. Everything about this game is simple - the art, the story, the music - but yet, I was just so moved and enjoyed every minute of it. In this case, Okujou no Yurirei-san really proves that simplicity is not a bad thing at all. In fact, it is what makes this game so good in my opinion.\n\nI won't go into any spoilers, but all I can say is I really loved the moral of the story and how so many things are connected with one another. Truly a work of art.","February 12","true","26.8"," 117 of 135 people (87%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","87","117","135","11","0"

I saw this mentioned the week or so leading up to the game by a few people and I decided to give it a try since they had a demo avaliable. I'm extremely glad I did because this ended up being one of the best visual novels I've read, with wonderful characters and an emotinal plot. Though the game is rated 18+ and does contain sex scenes it's quite tame overall, and really doesn't even factor in until around halfway through the game. I was also surprised how the game tackles the subject of relationships, it doesn't pretend that they happen overnight or without some stumbling blocks. I mean the story is still pretty fluffly overall (it's about lesbian ghosts that wanna spread the lesbian around a school, c'mon) but I still think it took the romances realistically for the most part. Anyhow, let's break down what the pros, cons and nit-picks bout this game real quick.\n\nPros:\n-A great main character, Yuna was delightful throughout. Almost all of the characters (barring one or two minor examples) are well written\n-Emotionally engaging story, I'll admit I teared up quite a few times\n-Satisfying ending\n-Extra scenes that open up once you complete the main story\n-OST is good, even if there are only about 12 tracks.\n-Game takes relationships surprisingly seriously.\n\nCons:\n-Some of the couples are just not as interesting as others, and the game makes you follow every side story\n-Title is kinda weird. I read why it's that way but it's still weird.\n-There ain't much porn if that's what you're here for.\n\nNit-Picks:\n-I wish there had been just a bit more drama. I love the story but half the time the main character is just sitting around waiting for stuff to happen\n-While the extra scenes after the main story were a nice touch, they were kind of pointless overall, to be blunt. While it did flesh out the relationships between some characters a bit more, they didn't do much for me. I'd have much preferred it if they'd given each of the couples a "one month later" epilogue or something\n-Some of those songs in the OST, while good, might get annoying once they play for the 50th time\n-I wish the game was longer. Though this should probably be a pro, I think this is one of the best compliments you can give a game. I wish there was a sequel, anime, something,\n-By the way, if these ghosts wanted to see girls doing it, they DO have the internet. Feels like they could've solved this problem in 10 minutes. (I know not really, but still)\n\nOverall the game was a delight to play, and I hope more similar games come soon. I don't usually replay visual novels, but I get the feeling I'm probably going to replay this one in the upcoming weeks. If I was giving this game a rating I'd say it's a 9/10","February 14","true","24.8"," 74 of 84 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","74","84","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sinvey/recommended/402620/","sinvey","Heretic Saint","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sinvey/","296 products in account","I initially purchased Kindred Spirits out of curiosity regarding both its style (yuri without the usual exaggerated/cartoony art direction) as well as a novelty ("first uncensored game"). Being a complete noob to Visual Novels, I had expected something that would keep me entertained for 10, maybe 15 hours -- but as you, dear reader, can see above, this game has kept me occupied far beyond what I had dared to assume.\n\nIn my opinion, the charm of this game lies in the attention to detail that went into fleshing out all its quirky characters. Some of them may fall into well-known cliches, but they do so in a manner that is endearing rather than grating, and thanks to the way their personalities interact with one another, all of them are deeper than just a collection of shallow categories.\n\nI also really like the art style of this game, for the soft colors and realistic proportions are nice change from the ubercute semi-chibis you see in other VNs, and together with the game's setting and the characters' inexperience in matters of love, it weaves a realistic environment where it becomes easy to feel with and root for those poor girls who are understandably overwhelmed by these blooming feelings.\n\nKindred Spirits is NOT a "porn game", and whilst this may come as a disappointment to some, I'd say it is actually one of its greatest strengths. "Fan"service such as pantyshots or ridiculously exaggerated breasts are thankfully absent here. Make no mistake: in spite of its spicy yuri scenes (tasteful nudity, in the words of the developer), this is ultimately a game about emotions, and you may find yourself laughing or crying with the characters as the story progresses. The writer as well as the translator deserve appreciation for what they have crafted here, and it seems to show in how popular the game has already become -- so much so that it seems to develop into its own franchise, already with 4 Drama CDs soon to be released on Steam.\n\nIt took me a little bit to get used to the calendar you use to select and play/unlock the game's scenes, but I've quickly discovered its value in how it makes it easier to assume the role of different characters experiencing the same scene. I'm not one of those players who hunt down every single "route" they unlock with different choices (I play through a story once, and that's my headcanon), but even so I was amazed by the sheer amount of content. Even after the main story is over, there's a ton of "extra" scenes that provide additional insight into the side characters, answering questions that may have been left unanswered so far.\n\nPROs:\n+ *very* likeable characters with realistic teenage worries\n+ amazing artwork (including the chibis!)\n+ (mostly) superb voice acting, in particular for some of the more emotional scenes\n+ lots of content (extra scenes, song lyrics)\n+ DEM FEELS (slice-of-life, slapstick, romantic comedy, drama)\n\nCONs:\n- few choices (I'd almost classify KSotR as a "Kinetic Novel", though this did not detract from it being crazy fun)\n- not consistently voiced (a few additional scenes may have benefited from voiceovers)\n\nYouTuber Nixxi is hosting an incredibly funny LetsPlay here, though I greatly recommend only watching it after actually having played the game yourself so that you benefit from fully developed attachments to the characters that are being made fun of: https://www.youtube.com/user/VnixxiR/videos\n\nThere is also a petition to turn Kindred Spirits into an anime: https://www.change.org/p/liar-soft-make-kindred-spirits-on-the-roof-into-an-anime\n\nFinishing thoughts: I'm glad I purchased this game, and I'm glad to see it expand into a full franchise. This is the 2nd game I've ever reviewed on Steam, which should show how much it means to me right now. If the studio ever does a prequel or sequel, it will be pretty much an automatic purchase from me.","April 4","true","56.8"," 40 of 40 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","40","40","3","0"

In other words, I've already read it. Niche titles like this need all the support they can get after all, so if this VN even slightly interests you, I'd say go for it. (Guess I'm already showing my bias huh?)\n\n屋上の百合霊さん, officially translated to Kindred Spirits on the Roof, is a Visual Novel about love. Girls love, to be more precise. The protagonist of our story is Toomi Yuna, a student of Kokonotsuboshi Girls Academy of Commerce. The plot sets in motion when she encounters the ghost of two since long deceased girls who happened to fall in love with each other in the afterlife. These girls wish is to experience their ”first time” together, only problem is, they're just not sure exactly how to do it. Which is why they request for our protagonist to create a ”Yuritopia” at the school, by helping girls struggling with their feelings. For those not so versed in weeb vocab: They're basically asking her to make the school into a lesbian paradise.\n\nAnd that's more or less it. I realize it sounds kinda dumb when I put it like that, but stick with me! What I described in the above paragraph might sound like some generic setup for some kind of porno or whatever, but be aware, this VN is far, far from what some people might want you to think. This is sadly the curse called prejudices this game is inherently burdened with. With the western VN market being such that it is, it's inevitable that it would at a glance be grouped with the likes of Nekopara or Sakura Beach etc. But I repeat, this is not the case. Kindred Spirits is not aimed at your usual western VN or Eroge demographic. If anything, Kindred Spirit panders more to the female readers than the male ones, as I feel it is completely devoid of the male gaze. Yes, there are sex-scenes. But then again, their focus and implementation relies more on the romantic aspects, rather the sexual ones. They are there not so you can get your rocks off, but to finalize and deepen the relationship you helped come to bloom. It's more beautiful than sexy, and cute rather than seductive. This is something that I feel needs to be brought to light, if just to ever so slightly elevate some of the prejudice plaguing this VN (or genre as a whole). It could certainly be seen as fanservicey or whatever the kids call it these days, but then again there is nothing inherently bad about that. Bottom line is that this VN is not offensive. It takes a concept that could easily make 100 times the profit by being a straight up Nukige, or self-insert Eroge, and instead makes something endearing and romantic out of it. That is at least commendable, if nothing else.\n\nBut enough of that. Is the story itself any good? Is there any gameplay? The story itself is nothing complicated at all (which you could probably tell from the synopsis alone), but nor does it try to be. It is simply a story about love. It just so happens to be between girls this time. It is both cute, charming and funny as hell at times. It is a straightforward love story, without much depth, twists or deeper meaning. If you're feeling up for some HNNNG's then this is the story for you.\n\nThe gameplay is not much to speak of to be honest, since the story is mostly linear. You won't have any bad endings or failed routes. Which also means that you won't alter the story overly much with your inputs, but rather reading a story. There's no fail state, game over, or dead ends, only love～. There are a couple of extra scenes and dialogue, but that's about it. The game time is somewhere between 10-30 hours. It is in other words, a relatively short to medium long-ish length VN depending on your reading speed. What I have seen of the translation so far is that it is not only up to par, but actually very good and genuine. It goes without saying that this is as good as it gets as an English reader.\n\nTL;DR: If you are looking for a romance heavy Visual Novel without having to self-insert as a faceless protagonist to sex up some underage girls, this is probably as good as it gets. If you don't mind, or even prefer GL over vanilla,  then this is no doubt as good as it gets no matter your other preferences. If you're looking for porn/fanservice, or something to get your rocks off, you should probably look elsewhere. The same goes for those wanting a dark, mature or deep story of any kind. What you're paying for is a cute, well-written and funny love story that I urge you not to miss.\n\nAnyways, those are my poorly written, hastily put together thoughts on this particular VN. Check it out I'd say. It's good. Ignore the usual prejudices, but at the same time, know what it is you're paying for when you buy it. I might come back to edit the review if it would prove necessary, but I'll get to that when I get to that.\n\nThanks for reading, and remember:「ユリトピア」にするために！","February 13","true","1.1"," 59 of 70 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","59","70","2","0"

No......not at all.\n\nGranted, #yuritopia is definitely an apt, one-word description for this VN, but....well....it's too substantial. Of course, Liar-soft knows their target audience quite well, so it is ultimately, uh, quite scandalous. So, it is obviously not nearly as philosophical as Utena or as strict as Hourou Musuko or as dramatic as Maria-sama. It's not that deep. But, it's not as fluffy as Yuruyuri or Love Live either. If I had to place it, I suppose it's spiritually not far off from Aoi Hana or maybe, Sasameki Koto?\n\nI think Yurirei is smarter than both of those though.\n\nTo begin with, Yuna is neither ditzy nor particularly shy. Her mature, reliable personality is the freshest possible gasp of autumn air as a female protagonist. Her quiet confidence is intoxicating, her mannerisms are delightful, and I identify with the way she thinks immensely. She does have some of the cold and withdrawn characteristics that I see more often in male protagonists, such as the famous Tomoya Okazaki, but she is about twice as caring, 10 times smarter, and 100 times as responsible as that guy. Hina is also amazing, even more so as seen through Yuna's eyes. Her blunt cuteness is not some ____dere gimmick, but the main pillar of her personality, and she is, in many ways, just as responsible and intelligent as Yuna herself.\n\nIn fact, in general, these writers seem to revel in introducing certain tropes, then annihilating them. In a low quality story, Aki would really just be an uptight prude that gets "broken in" by Youka. Then, their relationship would have no meaning beyond 'opposites attract.' Seina would just be a shy freshman. Tsukuyo would really be an incompetent teacher. Nena would just be a dumb girl that falls asleep all the time. In most stories of this type, I tend to think to myself, "How are these people so thick and clueless?" In Yurirei, I am just as likely to think, "Oh, I didn't realize she'd already thought about it that much." or "Whoa, that was quite perceptive."\n\nAh, I fear I may have already spoiled too much. For maximum enjoyment, please go in blind now.\n\n*ahem*\n\nThe focus is on characterization, not panties; this is a story of romance, not sex: the uncertain confession, the embarassed atmosphere, the soft touch on the arm, tension, suspense, and ectasy. Their relationships develop in a way that feels natural, despite the manipulation by Yuna and our resident ghosts. Couples respect each others' boundaries, and they care deeply for each other. They plan their future together. They talk about how their parents or society might perceive them. Unnecessary fanservice is minimal, and even when kinky stuff finally starts happening, the art doesn't zoom in on their boobs, but does a great job of showing their expressions and body language; it is all rather sensual, and, imo, in very very good taste.\n\nHence, in case you haven't figured it out yet, if you're buying this just to, uh, yuri your yuri, you're probably going to be extremely disappointed.\n\nHowever, if you're a true yuri lover like me (hehe), you will fall in love with this......as I have.","February 21","true","39.7"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","32","35","2","0"

There's not really any other way to put it. I like the medium in theory, but the vast majority of what you can find is just bad. Pacing in particular is a problem, followed up by tendency to throw in reprehensible content.\n\nKindred Spirits is novel right off the bat because something actually happens in the first hour. While it's not immune to pacing problems, Kindred Spirits' plot moves along fairly regularly, aided by the device of the planner breaking the story into discrete chunks. Another thing that stops Kindred Spirits from feeling like it's stalling out is the fact that it follows a handful of couples, so someone's story is always advancing meaningfully whatever you're reading.\n\nThe couples are what is going to make it for you if you like the game. The characters are all unique and fairly well written, and the game for the most part does a really good job of differentiating the characters' internal monologues when there's a scene from their perspective. Yuna is an interesting character and one who I feel a lot of kinship with, but seeing the antics of the various couples as they fall in love and strive to start a relationship is bulk of the draw.\n\nWell, I guess there's one other potential draw. The elephant in the room.\n\nAccording to one of the translators, sexual scenes are only roughly 6% of the script. Having read all of it, I'm surprised it's even that high- and if sex scenes are 6% of the script, then things like "nngh" and "ahn" have to be at least 3%. I'm not a huge fan of sex scenes in these kind of games to begin with, but if you're going to have them Kindred Spirits' ones are fairly good. They do a decent job of making the people actually seem like teenagers who have no idea how to bone, and the CGs never get more explicit than a few anime tiddies. Unless you're incredibly morally offended by euphemistic reference to heavy petting you'll probably be fine- it's not like people are breaking out the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for a 50 page orgy.\n\nOne complaint you can level (aside from the pacing and editing, which, while WAY above VN standard, is still a little long sometimes)  is the "extra scenes". Once you finish the main story, you're only about half way done. Various scenes pop up all over the planner, and the main way they're unlocked is making choices in the main game. This is sort of a hassle, so I'd recommend just going back and choosing the other option every time you see a choice to get it out of the way early. The extra scenes are nice, but they're where the game threatens to outstay its welcome. Personally I was charmed enough to enjoy it right up until the final extra scene, but I suspect a lot of people will be done about halfway through the extras.\n\nAlso, the game makes you think it might have alternate routes, but that's a lie, choices only affect the extra scenes. Which is a shame, but there's nothing wrong with there being one story you want to tell.\n\nIn summary, Kindred Spirits is a cute little game that's a lot of fun. It lasted me about a month and I enjoyed my time with it.","March 22","true","61.5"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","30","32","0","0"

Just go and get this game now!\n\nIf you're just curious and think that the price is too high(it isn't, the price is very average for a standard medium-long VN, but people who don't usually buy them are still not used to this), then wait until the price drops a little and get it ASAP.\n\nWhy am I saying this? Because the story and the characters are all very endearing, and it doesn't feel like you're reading something boring and dull, mostly thanks to characters that aren't your average cookie cutter archetypes, and this also reflects on their relationships.\nReading it all the way to the end(don't skip the extra scenes!) will finally make you exclaim "yes, now this was a good yuri VN!"\n\nAbout the sex scenes: they're few and they're all very tame(also no genitalia, only breasts and nipples are shown in CGs), so don't go in expecting to watch the lesbian kamasutra or anything.

Some side stories, that I felt, could have been elaborated a little more.\n\nDecent soundtrack: After going through the story, I'm hoping they make the soundtrack easy for puchase on Steam.\n\nDecent artwork: The creators did a great job on making the scenes feel natural, and the characters are what I like to describe as modern - this VN could probably become an anime/OVA of some sort, and not like some old ecchi from the early 2000s.\nThey also did a decent job of making the characters look great in the softcore scenes, if you catch my drift (lol).\n\nDecent performance - When the game is running, but you swtich windows, the game may slow down, and you will see text slow down as it rolls across the screen.

Don't get me wrong, Yuri's good, heck I love Yuri. I don't want to brag but I only needed to rest for an hour every time the girls kissed in Sakura Trick. Anyway, usually Yuri VN's are kinda too straight forward. I've seen many Yuri NV's in my time and I gotta say, it goes like this:\n\n- Talking\n- Kissing\n- Y U R I S E X\n- The end\n\nKindred Spirits on the Roof isn't like this (To all who are dissapointed that it isn't like this, shame on you, and me.) The characters are lovable, memorable and down right sweet and you'll have to rest for a whole day just to get your blood sugar in normal levels. The art feels kinda 'home'-ish, if that's a correct adjective to use for art. It certainly is good don't get me wrong.\n\nThe characters are well made, specially the main character. Usually when you see a girl in a VN you think "I want to see that girl nekkid doing hot lesbian action with another girl" (Is it just me? Really? ♥♥♥♥ you guys.) But the MC of Kindred Spirits left me with the feeling of "I want to be friends with this kind of person." But the latter still applies, that's why we have the MC's friend Ano. Ano is a Best.\n\nNow for the negatives.\n\nThe only negative I honestly could find right now (Since I haven't finished the game yet) is the music. Again, don't get me wrong the music is good, makes me want to jump around and frolic in the fields of Japan with my lesbian friends, but god damn the LOOPING is just damn horrible. You play the VN then the jumpy uppity music plays, and you're so happy, the characters are happy, the gods of Yuri are happy, then the music comes to an end and you think "Oh ♥♥♥♥ is it gonna be serious? ♥♥♥♥ is this ♥♥♥♥ gonna hit the fan?? Don't ya ♥♥♥♥ing pull a CLANNAD on me ya ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!" Then the Music plays again and everyone is happy again.\n\nAll and all it's pretty gud.

I like visual novels, like CLANNAD. This game appears to be the first uncut yuri visual novel on steam, but it isn't too graphic. The price worried me a bit, but I made up my mind and decided to get it. I didn't expect this game to be good. I was really into the story, and I found myself playing 18 hours straight. I would never play a game for that long in one session.\n\nPros:\n+ A total of 7 romantic couples\n+ Has uncut imagery *wink* *wink* *nudge* *nudge*\n+ The pacing is good, not too quick, but not too slow\n+ Music is good\n+ Gallery\n+ Planner that gives you the days when something happens between characters\n+ Extra scenes after the game is completed\n+ Replay scenes over and over again *wink*\n+ Yuritopia\n\nCons:\n- Not many choices/ Choices don't affect outcomes (Counter Pro: It appears choices do matter in the extra scenes)\n- Only one ending\n- Voice-acting only in important scenes\n- The choices you make only have extra dialogue\n\nIn Conclusion   It was really tough for me to say bad stuff about the game. I just couldn't think of anything wrong with it. I finally completed the game, but I felt weird. I just wanted to stop; and forget all about this game, so I can play it again. In conclusion, I recommend this visual novel. I will also recommend the demo version if you still haven't tried the game out yet.","March 6","true","25.1"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

Sorry it's a little long,,\n\nPros:\n- Very very cute art! A good variety of sprites, expressions, and CGs.\n- Catchy and effective OST, with an included “music room” to listen to all the tracks.\n- Each character is distinct, has their own background, thoughts, motives, goals, personality, and problems/flaws that are all very relatable, or easy to sympathize with.\n- The couples’ stories were all really compelling, and each and every one felt like it had something to offer.\n- Some common yuri tropes are addressed and consulted, exposed for their flaws, or given a very human, realistic spin to them.\n- While it was nothing mind-blowing, the story was always engaging in some way, and EXTREMELY emotionally investing. I cannot stress enough how invested this game gets you into its interesting and compelling cast of characters, and all their relationships with each other, romantic or otherwise. I cried and burst out laughing and smiled and was on the edge of my seat and relieved and every other emotional a game could make you feel. (well, except for afraid maybe, haha)\n- SO. MUCH. EXTRA. CONTENT. AFTER THE MAIN STORY. Hours worth of extra scenes are unlocked based on what choices you pick in the game, so make sure to save at every choice so you can easily unlock them all!\n- The sex scenes were all incredibly tender and sweet, with beautiful art in CGs, and none of them felt gross or overly fanservice-y. (though the lack of Super Explicit Content might be a negative for some people)\n\nCons/stuff to keep in mind:\n- Not all the scenes have voice acting. Only major story events, couple events, and scenes that have CGs include voice acting.\n- I’m not a fan of a good handful of the voices. Too many of them are shrill and high-pitched, which can be pretty annoying, especially with the characters who are also loud and cheerful on top of that. (I recently found out this might because a LOT of the voice actors are reused for multiple characters)\n- Almost ALL the characters have obnoxiously high-pitched and squeaky voice acting during sex scenes.Doesn't ruin it, but it IS off-putting for me.\n- The background music doesn't loop; it fades out and then restarts, which can break immersion for some people.\n- No agency, and therefore no routes. The main character, Yuna, is entirely her own character, with her own goals and wishes and feelings. So, you can’t change the outcome of situations or the story. YOU the player don’t really have a say, and are only along for the ride. I know that tons of people will be disappointed to know that there are no routes and no agency on their part.\n- There’s a couple that’s a teacher and a student. Their relationship lacks the manipulation and toxic power-imbalance that plagues teacher-student sort of relationships, and so I personally was able to find enjoyment in their story, but I know that others might not, so I’m putting this out there now. (note: it is possible to speed through their scenes and arc by selecting the "Skip unread text" option in the options menu and then using the skip button)\n- Unlocking all the extras can be kind of confusing. Not too hard, but a bit of a pain\n- Some of the sex scenes felt out of nowhere, or like they weren't properly lead up to\n- The sex scenes are also WAY TOO SHORT. Could've used some more detail in the text and, like… fumbling and exploring and learning.\n- Some of the dialogue in the sex scenes was so over-the-top or weirdly put that it was unintentionally funny\n- And finally, there's a glitch that me and a friend of mine have, though I haven't heard of anyone else dealing with this yet. About every 15-20 minutes, the game will dramatically slow down and stop progressing, and nothing but closing will fix it. I found a way to slowly save the game and then close from the menu, but it's a bit irritating to pull off. Didn't bother me too bad, but I know it'd be a huge pain for some people. Hopefully this glitch is extremely uncommon.\n\nAnd finally, some tips:\n\n- SAVE AT EVERY CHOICE. You will need to go back to them to unlock all the extras, and they are WORTH IT.\n- NEVER. FORCE CLOSE. THE. GAME. EVER. It'll insist that you haven't completed scenes that you have, and make you redo them just to move on in the story, every time you force close. Always close from the menu.\n- If you live with other people, wear headphones. Trust me.\n\nFinal thoughts? This game was an absolutely joy to play, especially for its great cast of characters and compelling stories. Absolutely worth the price and more, for me, and I hope others will enjoy the game as much as I did!\n\nIf you want a more indepth version of this overview though (plus some extra tips), I posted one here: http://systemrestart.tumblr.com/post/139577888536/with-less-than-a-day-until-the-initial-sale-for","February 19","true","31.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

The shortest review I can possibly give would be one word: Masterpiece. However, I feel that such a short, generic review would not do this beautiful story justice. I also feel that it would be irresponsible of me to give spoilers to the plot, as it is best experienced for yourself as you play through the game, so instead, I will try to take the middle road between brevity and gushing over this wonderfully touching story.\n\nFor starters, if you are looking at this game simply because it is a yuri visual novel and you're expecting to get some good wank material out of it, you may want to move along. Yes, there are several sex scenes in the game. However, they are NOT written to entice or excite the reader. Rather, they are written realistically, in the perspective of the couples experiencing their first times together. They are not pornographic, but wonderfully, touchingly emotional.\n\nThe same can be said for the yuri romances throughout the game. They are not played up and fetishized, but are instead written in a sweet, pure way, genuinely fleshing out the feelings that the characters have for each other in a realistic way, as well as bringing up the worries of living in a traditional society that would see something wrong with them for feeling the way that they do.\n\nAll the characters are written fantastically, each having their own unique personalities, even if some of them do fall into some old character tropes from anime. There's the always sleepy (but surprisingly perceptive) Miyama Nena, the cuteness-obsessed Tsurigimine Kiri, and the air-headed, rock obsessed Koba Youka, to name just a few. While some of the characters seemed a little flat to me the first time they were introduced, the game does a fantastic job of fleshing them all out.\n\nOn top of the excellent writing, the soundtrack and cg are also top-notch. I did get a little annoyed with the fact that the music in the game doesn't loop, even though the majority of the music seems to be made in a way that it could loop. Instead of looping or stopping, it just fades out, then starts again from the beginning. However, this is a minor complaint, particularly when compared to the quality of the music itself. The cg for the characters and scenes is also fantastic, drawn very smoothly, but with just the slightest hint of sketchiness to the lines, giving it a sort of innocent feel that fits in with the overall tone of the game.\n\nIn short, if you're here because you have a fetish for yuri, don't bother. If you're here because you love love,  then pull up a chair, fork over 35 smackeroos, and get ready for a feels trip straight to YURITOPIA!","May 11","true","28.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

The game is fantastic. Probably one of the best takes in VN form on the yuri genre. It's light hearted, often funny and very touching towards the end, "healing", and characters are very cute. The things you may criticize in this game are mostly attributable to the development budget. That said, I can't comment on the translation. I assume it will be fine enough. The original text is plain and simple and I assume it remains as readable translated.\n\nLiar soft is one of the VN companies with a more indie feel. It makes very unique and fun games, though not necessarily with the highest production value. You can say it occupies a niche spot in an already niche market.\n\nOften times this is reflected in the fact that there is limited voice acting. That just means mostly the writer was more ambitious than the budget allowed in terms of full voice acting. I would also point out that although the consensus is fully voiced acted VNs are the way to go, partial voice acting allows writing of longer monologues, which some may enjoy.\n\nNow I was really surprised this game got released on Steam uncensored. The price is high but it's what you would expect for a limited audience release. If you buy this game it may encourage them to make bigger budget works with western release in schedule. When the volume is higher obviously that allows for different pricing schemes.\n\nFinally let me reiterate that the game is fantastic, espcially if you are a genre lover of yuri--it's not to be missed. If you can't get it now, wish list it and check it out later.","February 20","true","0.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Add in some great slice-of-life moments that make you laugh, smile, and empathize. It's that type of game. I think I could recommend it to just about anyone who enjoys sweet slice-of-life stories, manga, etc.\n\nFor me, this is one of the very few Yuri Visual Novels, and was a must-buy from what I heard. And I have no regrets- it is definitely worth the price-tag as well. Most will scoff at it, but this is very long for a Visual Novel- you have the main story scenes, the side-story scenes(marked by cherries on the planner), and then you also get access to post-main-story scenes which are represented by apples in the planner and are unlocked by making different choices in the main story. I did not expect to get character interaction between certain characters(namely those outside couples), but the apple extra stories have become some of my favorites since those characters that may have not gotten much love in the main and side stories shine here. This Visual Novel is huge, simply put. In terms of time, I have put in roughly 27 hours so far and have not finished all the extra scenes yet.\n\nThe bottom line- if you like Visual Novels at all, this is pretty much a must-buy.","February 21","true","34.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

She quickly becomes their (slightly unwilling) accomplise in bringing other girls in her school together.\nIn order of best to worst from my experience:\nArt: 10/10\nI havent seen a game of any kind in so long where the artist actually took the effort to make different costumes and colors for a whole variety of situations. In particular, I love the style <3. It really helps to bring to mind the feeling of a girl in love.\nMusic: 9/10\nThe track isn't very large, but what is there is well made and pleasant to listen to without being too overwhelming or distracting. Only problem I really had was that the tracks didn't loop at all.\nStory: 8/10\nThe premise of the plot is actually...kind of orginal? It definitely wasn't something I'd seen before. Of course, in execution, the story became a little more mundane, but it was still enticing to read from beginning to end, and I loved the ending.\nCharacters 7/10\nMost of the characters are well developed, but they tend towards fairly typical archetypes common in japanese culture, so if you're used to that, you might get bored of their antics quickly.\n\nAs for stuff that can't easily be graded:\n+ Game length: for me, I cleared the main story in about 20 hours, but there's more for you to do afterwards, and I estimate about atleast another 5-8 hours of gameplay is left. Not bad at all.\n- UI: While the UI is not cluttered, It is instead compact and fairly complicated for a VN, including far more visual buttons than is common. On that note, the options is fairly cluttered, even if everything is labeled.\n\nAll in all, I think the game is almost worth its full price, which is not something I'd say about most VN's, especially on steam. Even at 10% off, I think this game is worth buying.\n\nTL;DR : 11/10 would yuritopia again","February 22","true","36.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

I think the price-tag is still a bit steep, and I'd highly recommend watching this like a hawk for sales if you're truly interested in experiencing it. The demo will give you about the first 2 hours of story and introduce all of the characters. You can even carry over your save state from the demo since they're all held in simple files.\n\nThe other issue I've run into was performance. There's nothing about this VN that should cause stutters or lag, but I found consistently that I'd get about 20 minutes into a session and suddenly text speed would halve and the minimal on-screen movement of sprites would diminish even further than that. This problem might be localized, and it's ultimately a minor gripe, but I figured I'd give the heads up.\n\nThat said, I do highly recommend checking this out, especially if you're a fan of romance in any way. There's a lot to get into and there's a surprising amount to digest. The base game covers about 21 hours and the extra content delivers as many or more scenes in a smaller format for 5 hours.\n\nNot a single moment is wasted driving the narrative. There are multiple points of comedy (Ano is an absolute trip), there are chances to cry, and there are points of pure catharsis. This novel is a bit unique in that sex drives the narrative, yet is never solely the focus. It would be unfair to say the erotic scenes don't serve their own purpose in character development, but they are simply moments where everything comes to a head.\n\nI think the thing that impressed me the most in this is how organic the development of the main character is. I won't tell much, but it's very clear from the beginning that Yuna is not living entirely as herself. Her story perhaps more than any of the others is worth being read and appreciated.\n\nReally, the thing that will make you enjoy this game is the sheer realism behind it in spite of its crazy, spirit-driven premise. A wide range of situations reach all of the characters, from the couple that have been in love for years but have had to hide it, to a new, entirely taboo affair between a teacher and student, to a 2 out of 3 couple that overthinks absolutely everything.\n\nIf it were any use, I'd write paragraphs on paragraphs about the merits of each individual character, and that's really where the biggest strength of Kindred Spirits on the Roof lies.\n\nIn summation, when two ghosts tell you to make girls have sex with each other, you'd best damn listen.

Choices do matter, you unlock extra scenes with different choices. Gives you a reason to head through the game multiple times!\n\nI could not recommend this enough, I swear.\n\nSee, the thing with visual novels on Steam is that they're either lacking in story, lacking in emotional pull (for me, at least), or they're het (again, that's a problem with me, others may vary). So, as it stands, it's kinda difficult to find a good yuri VN on here.\n\nKindred Spirits on the Roof exceeded my expectations. I swear on my own life, this is one of the best VNs I've ever plread. It has characters that you can connect with, who all have their own emotions and worries and traits. I felt myself get attached to each and every one of them, all in a different way. The romance is believable, shockingly enough for a VN, and the more intimate moments don't really feel forced. Quick note: If you're looking for "Oh girl-on-girl is hot" then I suggest you look elsewhere, because there are far better smut VNs for you to play in that case (I recommend Sono Hanabira for that).\n\nI cried, I laughed, I smiled, I felt my face flush, I experienced more with this VN than I have...in a long while. Truly, one of the best I've played, and I am shocked to say that this surpasses Katawa Shoujo in my list of best VNs. This simply...hit me in a different way.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean this VN is perfect. The music can be slightly annoying I suppose, but it didn't bother me all that much. Also, you might feel like the story repeats itself sometimes, since you go back through to see the couples outside of the main branch with Toomi.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this enough, even at the price that it stands. 35 USD seems like a bit for a VN, but for quality...I feel quite confident in saying you won't find much better here on Steam.\n\nAlso, okonomiyaki is delicious, and I have this game to thank for sharing that with me.","May 15","true","29.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

But if on the other hand you enjoy the yuri genre in anime or games I most definately recommend this tittle! This VN feels very anime- or manga-like, but unlike yuri tittles usually, this game is more realistic because it takes time for the girls relationships to build up. There are so many heartfelt moments. The cast consists of 7 different girl couples, so there is bound to be someone you like. You get plenty of events and CG for your favorite couple too. The art style is absolutely beautiful and the 20+ hours of content also offers partial voice acting. This has been the longest VN I have played so far :o I have some of the exrta content still to be played, but I have finished the base story and as you visual novel fans out there know that amount of content is not common in this genre of games. So you are definately getting your money´s worth in content. There are some repetitive lines in scenes due to the game offering you the same situation from another persons perspective at times, but I personally didn´t mind it. The writing in common is very good in my opinion and the overall feel of the game reminded me of a good yuri anime or the "Sono Hanabira" game series, and I mean the more in depth games and not the Steam tittle because it fell a bit short due to censorship, even tho I still do love the game. But as a fan of the series me saying that this game even tops "A Kiss For The Petals - Remembering How We Met" means a lot.\n\nLong story short:\n10/10, the BEST Yuri game on Steam, a must buy for a fan of the genre~ :3 <3 #Yuritopia","May 12","true","25.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

So let’s get this started.\n\nSo, a simple announcement: This game does not have "steamy lesbian sex", as many people think. Nor is it a fluff “doki-doki magical girl” fest. At least not entirely. So if you want this game for either of those reasons, think twice.\n\nKindred Spirits, as a VL is really really nice. It's not a life changing game sure enough, but its filled with a good representation of "Girls Love" problems in a academic life style. I find the game long enough to expose and develop the whole story of the main characters and the different couples, and short enough you can play for a good amount of time without getting bored. (I know, it says I have about 5 hrs., but that’s because I had to run it outside steam. More on that later.)\n\nKS has a solid and heart-warming story with interesting characters that develop nicely as the game goes on. No character ever becomes blurred in the sidelines, and they all have enough screen time and importance to be worthy of development. The game exposes several scenarios, each represented by a different girl, and by a different couple. Other than the 2 ghosts, the game is very faithful to (what I can imagine) realistic problems someone in that situation can have, without going too much on fantastic territory. Even the ghosts have problems that (if so the case") ghosts could have. Then again, I´m not a girl who fell in love with another girl, so...\n\nAll in all,  Kindred Spirits on the Roof is a medium-sized game with good exposure, heart-warming and hilarious situations, down to the ground thinking and reactions and interesting characters. If I had to say something bad, it would be that two certain situations are a bit to abrupt for certain characters.  The sex scenes come way too fast and way too hard, making one or two characters feel a bit out of character. Then again, that's what happen when you get horny. Boys and Girls alike.  Other than that, It´s a game that I fully recommend to anyone that wants to get started on Visual Novels, likes Yuri and has some spare time.\n\nPROS:\n-Interesting Characters\n-Realistic plot\n-Cute situations\n-More Fluff than Sex\n-When in Sex, well represented\n-Complete and filling story\n-A lot of in-depth to the characters.\n\nCONS:\n-Characters can be OOC at times\n-Flat interface\n-Steam version crashes the game every 15 mins or so. (To stop this, run the game outside of steam.)\n\nGrade:\n8.5/10","May 14","true","7.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

After playing, A Kiss for Petals - Remembering You, I really needed a new Yuri/Shoujo-Ai game to play and this filled that slot perfectly.\n\nThis is also the first uncensored visual novel on steam; however, the story does not center itself around this concept, but on the interesting interactions between the characters themseles. The scenes themselves are actually quite tastefull and fit with the game's character driven storyline.\n\nKindred Spirits on the roof is an innovative and refreshing take on the visual novel genre; therefore, I would recomend anyone buying this game to both be preprared for and understand what type of game it actually is.\n\nYou play as a slightly anti-social girl who, while eating alone on the roof, discovers two ghosts and is then draged into playing match-maker for a variety of different yuri couples.\n\nThe purpose of the game is to create a Yuritopia!\n\nWhat else do you need to know about it to XD\n\nAs of this moment, I have completely cleared Kindred Spirits on the Roof XD\n\nThe only real problem that I had with the game was the fact that steam overlay does not work and therefore I could not take recordings or screenshots; however, despite this the game was so good that I ended up losing a few days sleep.\n\nDespite having only one ending, the game has a massive amount of extra content after the initial storyline ends. Extra content is garnered by choosing different dialogue options when they are presented towards you; however, as previously mentioned, the game only has one ending so your choices do not actually affect the main game.\n\nOn the subject of characters, I was actually quite suprised by quite a few characters in this game as well as how my opinions on them shifted later on. There were about two or three characters I just did not connect with, but there were also quite a few a characters that I initialy disliked who ended up being some of my favorites. I actually wish that a few of these characters had gotten a bit more time spent on them, but there is always the possibility of a sequel....maybe.\n\nThe art style was about mid-range for me, but it was a lot better than I was expecting and actually complimented the game's other elements quite well.\n\nThe ending, which I will not spoil, brought everything to a close quite well.\n\nOverall this was quite a great game and I would deffinitly recommend it to those who enjoy yuri and/or visual novels.","February 14","true","35.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If I was asked to describe 'Kindred Spirits on the Roof' in terms of my anime experiences, I would have to say that it reminds me of a cross between " Kuttsukiboshi" and "Sakura Trick" mixed in with a cross between "Maria Sama ga Miteru" and "Strawberry Panic".\n\nThe two ghosts - or 'Kindred Spirits' as they prefer to be called, may as well have been drawn from the likeness of Sachiko and Yumi. Not to mention, Matsuri and Miyu - the track and field sempai - look an awful lot like Sei and Yōko. This led me to believe that the design choice may not have been entirely unintentional. Considering how big a part "Maria Sama ga Miteru" has had in the Yuri/Shoujo ai genre it doesn't really surprise me. In fact, it almost felt as if the game was paying homage to these roots, expanding on them and going into an area that was not possible 10 years ago.\n\nI very rarely play a game through more than once – feeling as if once I've done the main story there are too many other games out there to try so no need to do all the "side stuff". Kindred Spirits on the Roof however is a visual novel that made me want to not only experience all the "side stuff", but made me want to re-experience it again and again - in the same manner as one would re-read parts of a favourite  book or rewatch parts of a movie that left an impression.\n\nAs flaws are part of any review, I do feel obligated to touch upon them. Although, in my opinion, the main flaw here is simply the lack of voice acting. While all the main scenes have voice acting – it would've been great to see it in the side stories as well. The voice acting in this game is so exceptional that it's truly a shame that there's not more of it.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for an experience that will put a smile to your face and make you feel good about life, love and the human race in general – then look no further. Kindred Spirts on the Roof will do just that – and more. In my 100 + hours with the game I got the 'full clear' icon with all the extras unlocked – yet I'm still keeping it in my favourites so that I can come back to it whenever I need a 'pick-me-up'.","March 26","true","154.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The stories intervine perfectly and the characters interact naturally with each other. One is able look into each character's head and maybe that's why they are all very likeable, everyone has their own reasonable concerns and worries. In terms of writing and length this may very well be the best visual novel I have read so far in a genre I am quite fond of but end up being disappointed very often.\n\nSadly the audiovisuals are not on par with the writing and those which other VNs present, I don't mind the mild and pure depiction of what made it unsuitable for all-ages, it's quite fitting actually and just shortly going back to the writing: Those scenes are actually quite meaningful unlike in some many other works.\n\nIt's obvious why the audio could be better, way better, while the Voice Actresses are all very good as one might expect, the times there is actually voice acting is very limited.\n\nAbout the visuals, while not bad at all, it'S just that in comparison the drawing appears crude and the number of sprites is low. I can't really argue about the prior but still I personally prefer it smoother.\n\nWoth mentioning and up to each self to decide is whether they really want a story with real choices and different endings because the choices here are swallow and there is only one ending for all. I really do not mind at all though obviusly it would had been an interesting read if it was possible to end up with other character.\n\nCertainly there is also the point regarding the price but that's again not up to me to decide, all I can is inform you about the fact that I took like 20... or maybe even 30? hours reading it (and like 20h idling, napping or doing something else while Steam was counting an alt-tab'd game) so it seems like a fair value proposition to me at least, as long as it is enjoyable that is and indeed this was the case for me.","February 19","true","48.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Great characters, storylines that are mostly good and enjoyable. Really cute couples. There are 6 total and there's both a postive and negative to that. It's great to follow each couple's story but parts of the mainstory are seperated by scenes seen through the perspective from the girl's you encounter and/or help through out the game, and it can be a bit much, especially when there is like more of those scenes than main characters scenes for a given part of the game. You can skip through them if you want though. I didn't, since I enjoyed those scenes and didn't want to skip out on any story in them, it just bothered me how much they delayed continuation of the main story. In the end, I would have preferred just going straight through the mainstory and only afterwards, going through all the couple scenes and stuff. Still, it was a great game. I loved the main character in it.\nGood stuff, plox more games of this quality.\nAlso voice acting was mostly on point.\nNot all parts were voice acted but there is plenty of it and most of it was fine to me.

The characters themselves are very likable and the effort that went into creating them is immense. I enjoyed every second I poured into this game.\n\nFor those who are looking for choice-based games, I'm afraid this one won't really serve your needs. There is ultimately only one ending and the choices, however rare as it is, does not influence any of the relationships' outcomes nor the ending itself. However, making the correct combinations of choices will unlock 'extra scenes' after you complete the main story, giving an insight to the characters in short snippets of background events.\n\n10/10 - Highly recommended for anyone who likes Yuri or just want to have a good read in romance.\n","February 20","true","2.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There is enough variety for anyone to find characters to their liking and while I liked some characters a lot more than the rest, I did not hate any of them. Even the teacher/student pairing, made all the weirder because the teacher looks like she is 10, did not grate on me like I tought it would, mostly because every character has her time to shine and her own quirks.\nMore than anything, I felt like this game perfectly captured the nature of teen drama as I remember it. How even the most insignificant of exchanges can be misunderstood and blown out of proportion, not because anyone is mean, but simply because everyone expects others to just understand "obvious" stuff via pure empathy.\nThat said, in my teens, things did not resolve so systematically well for everyone... but here the happy endings go a long way to compensate for the sad moments (the whole premise is about ghosts of long dead high school girls who never experienced love in their short lives and  want to so that they can move on... yeah, want some fries with your angst?).\nAs for the sex scenes, they are more erotic than pornographic and mostly well built up into each couple's narratives.

The R18 stuff is not much, with 1-2 CG per pairing with nothing much going on, along with conveniently placed stuff to cover the private part. You can see nipples, but that's about it. So again, don't buy this if you're looking for the R18 content\n\nIf you're not just looking for that, then maybe wait for a sale or something. The price is a bit daunting indeed, but for me personally, i did not regret buying at launching discount, at all.\n\nGameplay:\nNothing much, it's just your usual VN. The kicker here is that everything is already predetermined, so no matter what choice you make, the ending is still the same. The choice however would unlock more extra stuff for you to see after the main game complete, which makes the playtime more than worth it. Unlike usual VN where you go in a straight line, this VN enables you to go parallel, meaning there's one main story, and several side story that you happens at the same time in the timeline. So you'll be playing as several characters, seeing it from their own perspective, which makes the depth of the story really hits home. Of course, this can leads to several moment where some story ended up on some not-so-likeable note and you need to wait for the story to progress to see the continuation. So far it's not a problem to me, but it's definitely not something i'm used to.\n\nStory:\nIf you're buying this not for the story, then you missed out a hell lot. The story here is well written and nicely paced, and with the unique cast of pairings, well maybe not so unique, but some is, you can't help but like most of the cast. This is not your perfect utopia where everything went smoothly, which means every character have their own conflict to deal with, adding more realism to the story. This game is one of the few games that actually managed to make myself cry, despite being a R18 yuri VN. Overall, i cannot reccomend the story enough. Definitely a must buy if you enjoy School Romance and Yuri genre.\n\nOh and the supernatural part do comes in and out of the story, but in the end it doesn't really affects the realism.\n\nGraphics:\nYour standard VN style CG and sprites. Can't really comment much on this part, but if you like what you see in the screenshots, you won't have any trouble liking the art-style. The R18 CG is pretty well done though, i must admit. Definitely more detailed than the screenshots provided.\n\nSound:\nThe VA is great. Every voice fits with the character, and the acting quality is really good. You won't be disappointed with the VA quality. What you might be disappointed with might be with the amount of voiced lines. NOT ALL LINES ARE VOICED. All the main point of the story is voiced however, so in the end it's not much of a problem. The R18 section is voiced, so yeah.\n\nThe soundtrack is nice and all, but there's nothing more to it. It fits the mood well, but i won't go as far as to reccomend it. The OST isn't so bad either, but yeah, just decent. One of the insert song was quite good however, which i would reccomend listening to it.\n\n\nTL;DR:\nYou like good storytelling? You like yuri? Buy it, it's worth the money. Don't buy it if you're in it for the R18 stuff.\n9/10\n\nP.S. Hina is the best girl in the entire universe","February 28","true","19.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Anyway, this game was designed for a very specific demographic. If you do not consider yourself part of this "demographic" or are looking to become part of it, don't start here. Go far away from here. However, if you are indeed a lonely manchild, you might want to check this one out. It's got nice visuals, and pretty good music. It's also about helping lesbians hook up. There's really no more depth to it than that. I'm not going to lie to you and write some review about how the story is miles beyond the teenage wet dreams you'd find on a fan fiction website. This is a game just like how Fifty Shades of Grey deserved to be  a New York Times best seller, but even that found its market in sad middle-aged mothers. Basically, just know your taste in games and you won't disappointed when you do/don't decide to purchase this game.\n\nTL;DR - A highschool girl learns that even in death, one cannot escape the unstoppable tide of yuri love. 10/10","February 12","true","3.2"," 30 of 66 people (45%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","45","30","66","13","9"

The actual sexual content is almost incidental, although I would still recommend for adults only.\n\nWhile the game is expensive, it is also quite lengthy for a single route with bonus content, between 30 and 40 hours.  Normally I like to read for just a few hours at a time, to let a story marinate and let me immerse in its setting and characters and situations.  Although each scenario is relatively short, there's always something happening or something to look forward to or some reason to read just one more!  After the main route is completed the game opens up bonus scenarios equal to a small fandisk, which is good because no fandisks were made so this is all there is.  I wish there had been more of Hina's "wawawa" moments, but what there is is very good.\n\nThe music is suitably cute with a decent variety of tracks.  Early on they got repetitive, and the way they faded out then got loud again when they looped to the beginning was kinda distracting.  Days later though I will sometimes hear them sneak into my consciousness at relevant times.\n\nThe characters are central to the experience, and everything about them is spot-on: their basic design, art, poses, expressions, outfits, actions, and voices are all perfectly suited to them.  Sure some of them are a little stereotypical or tropic, but the story at least gives reasons for them to be the way they are.  The characters share moments that are cute, sweet, touching, and occasionally surprisingly hilarious, all while staying in character.  I couldn't help but cheer for all of them.\n\nTwo characters deserve special mention:  Hina is the most adorable ever, and Yuna's voice actress nailed it with a sweet-sounding voice I could listen to forever.\n\nWhen it's all over, you're left with an ending theme by Rita that will keep me nostalgic for a long time to come.\n\nSachi-san, Megumi, Yuna, every day with you was so much fun.\n\nYuna, I hope you can meet them again someday.\n\nSayonara.

It's at least as long as a season of your typical anime series. It's also very well written. Despite the cast including two ghosts, the story is pretty down-to-earth and it's not as melodramatic as a lot of yuri stories. It also comes closer to the real world of LGBT-land than typical yuri stories; the word "lesbian" (or the Japanese equivalent, anyway) is actually tossed around, some characters worry about coming out of the closet to their families and friends, etc.. If you like visual novels and you like slice-of-life romance stories, Kindred Spirits is about as good as it gets. The only possible dealbreaker I can think of is that there's no male characters--if you suffer withdrawal and lapse into a coma when deprived of boys, then Kindred Spirits isn't for you.","February 28","true","42.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Voice Acting (VA) - For the most part the casting was spot on, the majority of characters fit well with their VA's however there were at least two cases were the VA's were horribly miss cast. They absolutely don't fit their respective characters. One especially more glaring than the other, and if you've watched as many anime and played as many VN as I have this can be  quite a major sore point.\n\n2. R+18 bits - Considering the premise it had to be done, otherwise the kindred spirits (or yuri-re as they want to be called) wouldn't be able to pass on. That said I believe that the game has massive potential to be a all ages love story that transcends gender boundaries. Simple and sweet. So I genuinely believe its R+18 portions actually hold it back.\n\nAnd with that over lets move on to the pros.\n\nStory - It's simple, it really is, there is no great drama, no dark mystery, no epic adventure, no grand revenge quest, nothing of that sort. But it works well for pieces like this. As an avid player of visual novels (VN) I've seen quite a myriad genres so, sometimes a nice fun and simple story like this is really just the best. 9/10\n\nArt - As with the story its fairly simple but well drawn, the art is crisp and nice, the character design was well thought out, each character having their own distincts faces and quirks. It's nothing impressive but theres nothing to complain about either. 8/10\n\nMusic/BGM - Same with the story it is failry simple, however they fit the mood of each respective story arc really well. Nothing on the level of Two Steps from Hell but then again this isn't that type of game. 8/10\n\nCharacters - Easily the best part of the game, I love the characters, ALL of THEM, they've all got their own personalities and quirks as well as distinct visual differences. Can't say much about them without bringing in spoilers but the attention to detail to each one is very pleasing espeically since they have a large cast of characters. And the character design is also well done, each individual is distinct from the other. This is actually impressive as even some highly praised VN's out there fall victim to their characters essentially being hair or skin color swapped versions of each other. 10/10\n\nGameplay - The format this VN uses is actually quite uniqe and refreshing and it also gets rid of the annoying repetitve nature of most other VN's when your chasing diffrent character arcs. It however means that replayability will sadly be non-existent save for reminesence. So it remains to be seen wether this is a good or bad idea. 8/10\n\nEnjoyment - I love Yuri VN's and its a damn shame more aren't in the english market. This was a nice change of pace however so it comes highly recomended. 10/10\n\nOverall - The Pros heavily , HEAVILY, outwiegh the cons so... 8.83/10\n\nTL;DR: I highly recommend this game to anyone who isn't averse to the genre (VN's or Yuri). And to those who are you, may want to try it anyway, they do have moments where it makes you think twice about the issues whichare often associated with same sex relationships.","February 18","true","35.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Perfect for any yuri fans or anyone who wants to see a good love story. The length of the game depends on how fast you can read, but I'd say it took me about thirty hours to go through the story and another 4 or 5 for the bonus scenes. All voice acting is in Japanese, and it only occurs in important scenes. The only bug with the game is that it doesn't mesh well with steam, so you can't open the steam overlay or take screenshots, and if you're playing the game through steam, it will sometimes freeze after 15 minutes. That can be avoided though by just running the program itself instead of playing it through steam. Fantastic visual novel that I will continue to distract me from any homework.","February 20","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visual novel is good.  After getting the full clear I suppose I can say this.  It is a very straight forward game.  There are no branching paths and your choices don't particularly have any effect except for unlocking secret scenes throughout the year after the main storyline is complete.\n\nI suppose my only gripe was that I didn't get a fully animated scene for Youka's show even as extra content.  I guess I can't ding them for not going above and beyond, I'm glad they recorded it at least.\n\nThe story is nice, there's enough variety that you'll have at least one couple to really root for.  It's a very solid game.  The game is not really a mold breaker(except for being on steam) so if you like this sort of visual novel, you'll like Kindred Spirits.

Very good story in visual format, great artwork and settings\n2. Well-developed characters, a majority of them being more than one-dimensional and fleshed-out (Phrasing, Boom!)\n3. Different perspectives, sometimes with surprising results!\n4. Emotionally heavy, but not in a burdensome way\n5. Light humor, heavy on the drama, sad when it needs to be, and nothing really unrealistic actually ('cept GHOSTS)\n6. Music fits really well with the situations, especialy with the tone of the scenes\n7. And featuring unsusual amounts of Japanese cuisine!\nCons-\n1.

Seriously that's what the internet is for so don't waste your money.\n\nI fully expected something like that from this game, just another excuse to ogle at fictional girls. To my surprise it was not like that at all, at least in the time I've played it thus far. No gravity breaking tities, no brain-less bimbos smutting up the place, no (well, almost no) hyper exagerated archtypes. It's almost as if Kindred Spirits wouldn't be a typical anime *gasp*\n\nJoking aside there is an interesting story here to enjoy, unless you don't like visual novels then see the above note, and the characters I feel are well written so that everyone actually becomes a character and not a one note prop to move the story. Best of all this is an actual game with choices. I don't know how the choices affect the later story, but it does give some agency to the audience which I think too many types of these games forget. The story is told different angles so I also didn't feel stuck with the main character through the whole ride. A nice thing also is that I don't think the game makes blanket statements about homosexuality, there are characters who question such pairings, maybe not enough to be more realistic but enough that the audience knows this isn't a completely common thing.\n\nThe one problem I have with the game is the voice acting. I am one of those anime fans who prefers anime subbed rather than dubbed which this game is, so if you have a problem with japanese voice acting that is something to note. My problem comes from the voices they chose for some of the characters. Everyone has a VA to them so that's nice, but some of them sound like kids in elementary or middle school. That's my thoughts though.\n\nIt's a nice game with a good story and more character than a stereotype anime. If you enjoy these things then this might be up your alley.\nBottom line: Good characters help make a good story, bad characters help it become porn.","February 29","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Decisions open up new side cut scenes once you finish the main game.\n\nLots of fun, and surprisingly nuanced relationships for a yuri VN. Definitley recommend if you're an avid reader of Yuri-Hime, like VNs, and/or are starved for more gay ladies being cute and gay together.","May 3","true","49.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

That's what gotten me into this VN\ni cherishes yuri as a pure love, even if they had sex, it's a pure love sex.\n\nfor the art, well, it's not that great it's a standard VN art, quite polished, and the character design is pretty good\nno comment for the music because i basically enjoy everything that i like to hear\n\nall in all, it's a pretty good VN if you're searching for diabetes and kidney failures. If you're reading the VN just for the lesbian sex, you're gonna be disappointed though, there isn't much sex scene in here. If you want to read lesbian VN for the sex, just read SonoHana series instead.\noh and they never show ♥♥♥♥♥♥s in this VN\n\noverall rating : 8/10\nyuri is sweet, no?","June 4","true","46.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However for the most part I really love it. The couples are a bit hit and miss but they're clealry designed try and tick as many boxes as possible and theres a couple for everyone I think. The game looks and sounds good, though its resolution options (or total lack therof) are a bit annoying and I came across a reoccurring bug where the game wold freeze after about an hour playtime, though I suspect this is more a harware problem and not the real probelm i have with this game.\n\nThe problem is that what you want, doesnt matter in this game. This game is about as linear as it gets and any choices you make are at best completely pointless and at worst simply there to give you the illusion you're participating. Now heres the real kicker. The game has a romance involving the player character, which you get to influence in absolulely no way whatsoever. A fact i learned after i made a choice the i thought loigically, would almost certianly cause a different outcome and it having apparenly no effec and never being brought up again.\n\nHonestly finding out that I had no agency in this world was shocking. The game's own presentation and genre had made me think that, of course being able to pick who the protagonist ended up with, that was a given. Instead the game had presented me with a choice that caused me to anticipate that I would get to pick a romance and given me idea who i would get to pick between and I in my enthusiam latched onto it. But I latched onto the wrong character, the one who though i prefered i suddenly wasnt allowed to romance. I was never supposed to romace them but I thought I would be able to and as it seemed more and more like I really wasnt ever going to get to romace the character I had over the course of ten hours set my heart on the more I resented the other character for not being her.\n\nNow you may be thinking. "That's a bit entitled surely? If the developers want to tell a paticular story they're allowed to." Which I agree with wholeheartedly. But it brings me to my second problem with this aspect of the game, which is that I find this romace to be uncharacterisically uncompelling, In fact I find the inital premise behind the romance slightly offputting being about as close to incest as you can get without it actually being incest and its not like this is a par of the game that can be skipped or skimmed over as its the main storyline.","March 10","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
