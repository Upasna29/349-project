It uses Newtonian physics, so you will have to learn how to steer your ship in space and when to accelerate and decelerate. Just like in real space. :-)\n\nThis may not be for everyone and I can respect that - but I love the kind of realism this game gives me.\n\nI also recommend playing this game with a controller or even better, a real joystick. That's what it was intended to be played with.\n\nI-War 2 has its flaws. The missions are easy at the beginning, but after a while you will get lost without instructions. Also, the starmap is horrible and your pirate buddy Jafs is constantly nagging. All of these can be solved with mods or a bit of reading, though! :-)\n\nThe game may also have some bugs if you play it on later systems than XP, but these can also be solved.\n\nIf you want a realistic simulator with awesome music from Christopher Mann and a cool story I highly recommend this game! But read my beginners guide first:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=444209295","May 17, 2015","true","0.8"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","22","22","0","0"

You can do this in the options menu.\n\nI am extremely glad to see this game on Steam as well. I have played this many times since its release and each year I hope to play it at least once. I own several copies, on disc as well as digital. It would be great to see an I-War 3 project revitalised, because the series is too good not to have sequels.\n\nWhile you don't need to play the previous games at all to enjoy the story (mostly unrelated to the prequels), I recommend all the games. They are space simulators packed with action and adventure. The campaigns are all great, diverse, and challenging. The story itself is quite nice: you are trapped in an ever-escalating war between Marauders, Corporations, and independents of the cluster. While employing diplomacy and weapons to get through it and make yourself a living, you get to uncover some other surprising mysteries of the universe. Compared to other space simulators, I feel that the quality of any I-War game in the series is much higher. I was not able to enjoy any other space-related games since playing the series. While I-War 2 may be difficult to master at first, once you do the gameplay is very rewarding to say the least. The game was very well built as well: it natively supported widescreen, at least 5.1 audio, and runs flawlessly on modern hardware. In short, my favourite game of all time.","June 7, 2015","true","20.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","1"

It's one of the rare occasions where you can play as a pirate in space. Unfortunately I witness some graphic glitches and stuttering if there are many ships on the screen. Maybe it's because of Win 10. Who knows. It's still playable though.\n\nFor those who own a boxed version: You can copy all language files over to the Steam folder and your game will be completely localized including video and audio.\n\nEveryone who is spoiled by games like Freelancer should search for a file called "mouse.ini". With it, you can play the game with mouse and keyboard. That works surprisingly well with a mouse set around 1600 dpi.\n\nGet it and enjoy one of the best space sims out there! If it's not too hard for you ;)","August 29, 2015","true","4.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It is what honed my skills in video game piloting, I had heard of a second game but i never had the chance to obtain it till now.  It is different but still a lot of fun, the old classics from the first game are still there like the Corvettes and Patcoms, but also new versions of them.  Clay is very different in this game from the first, but it does not detract from the enjoyment.  He's more melow which 200 years time might do that to a human conscious recorded into a computer.  If you haven't played the first one, his character will throw you off as who is this guy and why is he important.  I haven't finished this game yet but i'm still holding out hope of finding my old ship from the first game.","April 17","true","27.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm so happy to see it made it to steam.\nWhile I do enjoy playing this game, even to this day, the one major con is overly political socialist propaganda. It was said when the game first released, and I'll restate it here. The biligerent extreme left nonsense being shoved in players faces Murdered this game, along with its potential.\nBeing a space sim nut, I can get past it and just enjoy the game. The ease of modding the game is certainly my favorite part. The bulk of the game can be changed with a text editor, making so that rebalancing or going crazy overpower a snap. You'll have to search the web for it, but there is an iwar2 cult out there, still keeping the game, and mods for it alive.\n\nFlightstick Flightstick Flightstick!\nWhy anyone would want to play a piloting game that doesn't require a flightstick is beyond me. You can mod this game for mouse, but you will be missing out.","September 13, 2015","true","0.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

Also you can play it just fine using a keyboard.\n\nPlaying it ten years later I can apretiate how ahead of its time it was. The physics, the open world, even the Mass Effect-like dialogue trees. And it's still the only game I've seen where the distances between planets are realistic. It's not just a cutscene and *zap* you're somewhere else, you actually see the planets and asteroids whizz by you as you travel in FTL speeds.\n\nAfter a half-hour prologue you'll get your own crew of pirates and then it's off stealing cargo, selling it, upgrading your ships and getting revenge. This game is still good today and a I hiiighly recommend it for anyone who likes space-ship games.\n\nPS\nSome missions will be vague and confusing.
