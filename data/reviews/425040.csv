Even when they weren’t super popular among my group of friends growing up I was a fan. With the resurgence of super hero movies over the past decade or so my social circle has occasionally relied upon my knowledge and input in regards to the back stories and the histories of the franchises that have hit the silver screen. It’s been a nice change. Unfortunately, there hasn’t been very many comic book style games that have been of a very high quality released. The best that I can remember are the Freedom Force games. Thankfully, ComixPlay have brought the genre back to life with the superb ComixPlay #1: The Endless Incident.\n\nThe great thing about the game is that it actually is in the form of a comic book. It has 124 pages and makes for an enjoyable read. The action sequences that are typical of a comic book are transformed into turn-based combat bouts not too dissimilar to those featured in the likes of Final Fantasy and many other games. These combat sequences are not as easy as you may think. You need to survive a number of waves before you successfully complete a battle. It’s certainly a case of one complete battle feeling like a war. Thankfully if you find yourself unable to advance you can skip them and continue reading the comic and return to them later.\n\nThere are a number of different characters within the game and this has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantages is that it creates a significant amount of variety within the gameplay with different tactics able to be employed throughout the game. Of course, you may find that some of the available tactical advantages are stronger than others but much of that will be determined by your own strengths and weaknesses as a player. One of the disadvantages in my opinion is that by introducing so many different characters the story feels a little disjointed and cluttered when compared to other comics.\n\nAlthough I quite appreciated the comic artwork involved I did have a problem with the soundtrack. I think that its just too bland and it doesn’t really add anything of a positive value to the game. If you can follow a comic book and listen to a podcast or a television show simultaneously then this is the perfect game for it. Voice acting may have been a nice touch but an admittedly unnecessary one.\n\nThe game takes advantage of Steam in regards to achievements and trading cards. At $6.99 (15% discount until tomorrow morning) you’re looking at about the standard price of a comic book. If you’re a fan of comics then you should pick this game up as there is no reason why you wouldn’t enjoy it.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/\nFeel free to join our Steam group and Curation http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified","March 1","true","9.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

So In a nutshell this is a superhero comic book that let's you play out the battle's yourself via a turn-based battle system. The quality of the story suffers a bit from trying to cram in all the heroes (and the villians) flashbacks but overall it's a solid b-movie plot and the characters abilities are interesting enough to make the graphic title interesting enough in it's own right. The turn based battle system also came together pretty well and overall I would say this game/interactive fiction/whatever you call it was more than the sum of it's parts.\n\nThe turn based battles do require some strategic thinking. As there is no progression per level the interactions between different heroes abilities and the way they effect the villians become the focus. If your a fan of superhero team comics that concept in and of itself is a tried and true one. Recently other games like Sentinels of the Universe (digital and desktop) and Marvel Legendary have allowed fans a chance to interact and dictate the various battle royales of the mighty warriors from . This game takes that concept and blends it together well with a comic book itself. Introducting the players/readers to characters via the battle system is as far as I know a unique concept and I really enjoyed playing through this.\n\nIf your a fan of comic books and/or choose your own adventure games this game is definetly worth taking a long look at this title.\n\nI liked-\n\nIt's a Comic Book\nTurn based battle system\nFocus on Strategy and Interactions\nInteresting Concept\n\nAC/DC -\nPrice to content ratio is borderline (2-5 hours for the asking price)\nStory Content\nArt Style - I liked this pretty well and had somewhat of a nostalgia feel to it for me but nothing groundbreaking here\n\nNo Thanks -\nMusic - I turned it off after 3 minutes and made my own mix\nZero Replay Value - If you want to bump up the difficulty maybe but that's not really getting it done for me\nThe Graphics/Comic Book Cutout look to the Turnbased battles.....felt kinda of cheesy but without the cheekiness and self awarness of a game like CardHunter or Epic.\nSmall Number of Heroes (would like to see an expanded roster if they ever make a followup)\n\nOverall I would consider this an experience worth looking into if your looking to try something different or just miss the superhero comic books you grew up reading.\n\n6.5/10\n\n\n\n\n","February 26","true","5.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
