Also you can influence faction ship production through trading. A very dynamic system that involves pirates/trading/conquering planets.\n\nYou can have up to 3 squadmates, you can ally with one of the 3 largest factions in the game (Empire -humans, Starborn Federation- humans+alien, Omni Collective- borg-ish humans ), you can conquer the galaxy OR maybe you want to play a pirate and yaharrrrr the cargo out of the traders. Total freedom of choice. The game will end once a faction control the universe.\n\nThe space combat is well done: the ships have different speeds and turn rates based on race/size, the turrets have different turn rates based on size and weapon type, the projectile/beams can miss; the different weapons are fit for different enemies/roles. You can go full drone carrier and watch the beautiful drone AI swarm the living shiats out of the enemy, or you can go torpedo heavy+guns blazing, or you can mix it up. There are a lot of ships, to fit almost every role. ALSO...no matter how strong you get, if you jump between 8 enemy ships you will get shreded. No rambo mode in this game.\n\nThere is way too much to talk about so I hope at least I piqued your interest, because the game is GOOD. With future updates I think it has the potential to be a GREAT game. I wouldn't have beta-tested(for free) and gave so much input if the game was bad. If you look up my reviews, I gave SN1 a bad review because it was bad. Review still up. SN2 is another story. You can easily get 40-50 hours of enjoyment playing this game. Also very low price/content.\n\nps. What I love about the technical part of this game is that it works very well on crap laptops and pcs (aka dual core, hd4000 and reports of hd3000 performing well). I almost always game in window mode; I put in on pause and do other stuff, then I come back. Game did not crash once while alt/tab-ing, having youtube/twitch streams on, having multiple IDE on, or virtual machines.\n","December 14, 2015","true","46.9"," 70 of 80 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","70","80","3","3"

I’ll break down this review into two categories to fit the meta.\n\nWHY YOU WILL PURCHASE THIS GAME:\n\nThe combat is extremely satisfying! This alone makes this title worth playing.  Ship control doesn't feel like you are skating on ice, and you have the option to have your weapons auto target, or manual fire for reduced energy consumption. You can find NPCs on various planets to join you, and the AI and control options are simple and effective. Getting credit for kills means getting the last hit, which gives a sense of accomplishment for good timing.\n\nThe game is designed to be simple, so it isn’t overwhelming to get started, but there is enough depth in character development, knowledge of enemies, and ship design to keep it from getting stale.\n\nThere are three sizes of ships, with a fair many hull choices to suit different play styles including faction specific ships. Weapon selection is medium, but each weapon type has its own damage, range, rate of fire, shot speed, etc to differentiate it from the other types. There are slots for engine, shield, armor, and other mods on ships that further develop how well it performs. Ship progression happens fairly fast but leaves plenty of room for late game speccing.\n\nTrade is as simple as buy and sell based on prices in different sectors, and delivering goods that are scarce to regions in need. How well a faction is doing is directly related to trade and piracy, so you can affect your allies and enemies by making the right deals.\n\nThe Game Developer is super active  in patching bugs, fixing game data, and updating with new and improved content. This is a great thing because while this game is good as is, it will be AMAZING with more work.\n\nWHAT IS BEING WORKED ON/COULD USE IMPROVEMENT:\n\nOf the three character starts, being a pirate isn’t really a viable option. Pirates aren’t a true faction currently and I can’t see how they fit into the game from a progress standpoint. They are mostly just there to mess with factions and block trade/military.\n\nCombat is what it’s all about. Being a trader and mining are great things to do, but ultimately lead to a life of killing.\n\nThe greatest untapped resource in this game is the RPG element  through quests that begin on planets. The only quests I have encountered are through or related to the NPCs you can get in your squad. I would love to see a robust level of chat dialogue, quests, and other happenings that would add immersion to this universe. Cut scenes, NPCs, unique bosses, and challenges outside of the typical skirmishes. No planet should be a boring port with little more than a few generic commodities to trade for. Give me enemies and allies that I can love or hate. At the moment picking a faction is just a choice and I don’t feel the struggle between them.\n\nLike the pirate faction, the Zerker faction needs developed. They don’t own any space, and while I love how they behave in combat, they are just a bit too mysterious and lack any influence on the map.\n\nStar Systems are all the same layout. I would love to see varied sized systems, with multiple planets and varied locations for planets on the map.\n\nThat’s my $0.02 on this title. Come for the combat, stay for the continual development.","December 23, 2015","true","35.3"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","41","43","2","0"

I won't lie to you i was a beta-tester but i got very addicted. I play on roguelike mode since the beginning and i've got my butt kicked so many times when starting out as a noob, that i learnt the life of a bounty hunter can be pretty brutal. But now i'm flying a cruiser with 3 torpedoe launchers and 4 turrets and kicking butts, yep the game is still challenging and i nearly die at times.\n\nStar Nomad 2 has nothing to do with the first title, it is a deep squad-based combat rpg and character progression, which means there is replay value even in your character build. I specialized in missiles combat and shields penetration but i plan to start my second playthrough as a drone carrier, drones are fighters in the star nomad 2 universe. You can even personalize and level up your squad members in a similar way to your own character, giving them different roles in your squad. The universe never feels empty and is extremly dynamic, even when trading, smuggling or exploring.\n\nThere's quite a lot of secrets too and things to discover. I'm over 40 hours into the game and still have lots of things to discover, and the developper Halfgeek has planned to add free updates to the game. You can join the pirates, Human empire, Omni, Union and Starborn federation, there is also a merchant and mercenary guild and the equipment/weapons sold (Called modules in the game) depend on the production of a star system and its economy. Pirates plundering merchants in systems will disrupt the economy and mess up with the goods sold in that system, etc..\nIt is what i meant by dynamic universe. I recommend normal mode if you don't want to get your butt kicked too much and trader is always a good way to make money without taking big risks early on, but bounty hunting attracted me since the beginning of the game. There are random encounters and events and you will often notice on your radar a ship marked with !, those are special encounters that you never know what the outcome will be, with the choice to take part of it or not.\n\nEvery choice in Star nomad 2 matters, so beware. I made other bounty hunters (Npcs) jealous by stealing all their kills and they hired elite hunters from the bounty hunter guild to assasinate me. Even the enemy may hire those hunters to terminate you. Pirates will flee from you at times, depending on your high and fearsome reputation, communication from the npcs will change too. I achieved the reputation of Elite and Dangerous which i was very proud of. I recommend this game to people who enjoy a deep and rewarding space combat and trading game, built in an oldschool and challenging fashion.","December 14, 2015","true","50.5"," 34 of 45 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","34","45","3","0"

This one seems a lot closer to the "choose your own story" kind instead of the "hold your hand until you're op and you save the universe".\n\nFun game, takes a bit of time to get into and has a few minor annoyances, but the dev is super responsive (literally took him 4 minutes to respond to and give me a fix for a bug)\n\nMy first hour in the game was basically spent dieing as a hunter. I did the trading thing for a while, and once I got the merchant guild access it got a lot easier... but I wanted to be a hunter.\nSo in learning the combat system I spend a lot of time running around dieing, until I get the feel for the combat system. Now that I'm able to hit ships without the auto aim my dps has risen and I'm starting to pull in cash. Hopefully now I can start exploring and finding out new things about the game.\n\nA minor gripe is that the starter hunter ship has shotgun weapons... but not enough speed to keep close to pirate ships who have long range weapons. This means you have to do some fancy flying to keep pace.","December 14, 2015","true","17.1"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","21","26","2","0"

BTW they are really well done and good changes.\n- It's done by 1 independent dev, so doesn't have the big company polish of voice over by actors or a thousand micro options.\n- The dev is highly engaging and proven he's willing to take community input by putting out around 6 patch and updates all community driven.\n- serious RPG elements with 36 skill, multistacked. You need 119 skill points to master the whole tree and you only get 1 skill point per level. The tree goes through some level unlocks but by level 18 EVERY skill is open for you to pick and choose without restriction. No word on a level cap. So pretty expansive.\n-There's also a galaxy map for conquest, 3 major factions, 4 minor factions and 1 ultimate kill everything alien faction.\n-LOTS of potential and future plans.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/usarr/recommended/414950/","usarr","Ironhound","http://steamcommunity.com/id/usarr/","370 products in account","TL;DR: If you like Space Rangers 2, or EV Nova (minus the story bits) Then you owe it to your inner space trader/pirate/bounty hunter to pick this gem up.\n\nThis game is quite fun. I don't have nearly enough play time, but I'm seriously liking what I have played. I'm an experienced spacer with these kinds of games. I started with Freelancer, and moved on to titles like Elite, FFE, Privateer, Oolite, Asci Sector, Escape Velocity Nova, Transcendence, Rebel Galaxy, Starpoint Gemini 2, Elite Dangerous, Hardwar, Star Sector, X3 Albion Prelude, etc. etc.\n\nWhat I mean to say, is that sandbox space trading games are my kryptonite.\n\nSo what sets this game apart? Its lacking a in your face kind of story, it seems fairly simplistic, and the graphics look like a flash game. What sets it apart is playability, and how it organically opens up around you. When you first launch from the planet you might notice the UI, which is clean and easy to use. (Slightly less so if like me, you are colorblind...) Next you will notice the super easy controls. WASD, and your mouse do 99% of things, with J for jumping. Each sector is about the size of an EV Nova sector, but once you hit the borders, you hit a 'wall' useful for finding things. The map is excellent, and as you join the merchants guild, it will give you alot more information for trading.\n\nCombat seems difficult due to the bounty system and the way combat itself works. To be a bounty hunter you need to 'kill-steal' or get the last hit on a ship for the bounty reward. Capturing lifepods isn't nearly as lucrative. This makes for a rather tense game of knowing when to shoot, or when to manually use weapons to get the bonus. Enemy AI is fairly good, and fleet battles are downright terrifying to fly through. Again, the flight controls are quite intuitive, and you feel like an ace pilot after a few minutes of flying. Lots of weapons and skills to upgrade to create your ideal ship. Ships come in an abundance of types, from corvettes to cruisers and so on. You can also recruit a squad of wingmen and order them around.\n\nTrading depends on a dynamic economy with events. You need to move around a bit, taking advantage of the same events that draw pirates and competing traders alike. Once you join the merchants guilds, you can see real time prices on goods throughout the galaxy. It makes for a fun trading aspect, with you finding lucrative routes, and abandoning them for an event only to fight pirates the whole way. I never got bored, it evokes memories of Ev Nova and Space Rangers 2.\n\nMissions are kind of rare, with them being offered by NPC's in the galaxy, No BBS board or anything like that. The end-game seems to consist of you helping one of the factions rule the galaxy, but I'm not anywhere near there yet.\n\nOverall the game combines playability with hidden depth, and pulls it off wonderfully. If you can look past the graphics and need a nice, relaxing, after work game with some complexity and a living galaxy, I highly reccomend this title. Where Void Expanse fails, this game succeeds with flying colors, it helps that the Dev is already planning the next update, and adding several features as players suggest them.\n\nFantastic game. Like Endless Sky? Get this. Wish you had a real-time SR2 minus the story bits? Get this. Wanna fly a spaceship and do all the fun things gameplay wise that Elite Dangerous is ignoring? GET THIS.\n\n","December 15, 2015","true","5.6"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","3"

Unfortunately there is nothing that this game gives that is not simply done better by another game.\nFirst off, the UI for the game is completely offputting and at times terribly obstructing.\nThe combat feels like a stripped down version of the combat from Starsector, but you are actively encouraged to avoid combat in the first few hours of the game because enemy ships will completely outclass you, and you only get credit for scoring the last hit on enemies. Good luck with that when there are several other NPC's in the area fighting the same ships as you as you actively avoid having fun.\nTrading in the game is a weak version of what is found in Escape Velocity or Endless Sky, again marred by the lack of information in the UI.\nThe ships, while looking good offer little to no real variety, as you will simply be going for more/bigger turrets, more/bigger missiles, and more health. The dynamic That can be found in games like escape velocity, starsector, or SPAZ is completely lost here as in those games players could play with different playstyles based on their ship type and weapons, from fighters, to capitol ships, or somewhere inbetween with each ship having strengths and weaknesses. Mind you those systems hint at being in place in Star Nomad 2, but are either poorly implemented to the point of being irrelevent or not implemented at all.\nThere is simply no reason to purchase this game over any other game in the genre. If you like the genre, look for Endless Sky, Escape Velocity Nova, Starsector, SPAZ, or Gimbal.","December 15, 2015","false","1.4"," 39 of 63 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","39","63","3","5"

The easy game comparisons are FTL, Space Pirates and Zombies, and Void Expanse. The interesting mechanic that sets Star Nomad 2 aside is the real time events going on throughout the galaxy. A food shortage means trade profits for those willing to deliver; likewise a medicine delivery to a virus ridden planet yields large gains.\n\nWhat I enjoyed:\n\nSquare one – The systems you travel to are squares which contain different planets, asteroid belts, or stations. The idea of squares in space may seem a bit flat, but in this particular case it works well. The idea of using corners and edges to navigate is fairly intuitive and I was able to discern where I was travelling with little difficulty.\n\nTrading up – I love a good “start from nothing and build a fortune to buy a huge ship” narrative, Elite: Dangerous being my favorite, so this was right up my alley. I love the depth and level of upgrade available in Star Nomad 2. There are a number of different weapons and upgrades for your ship, and then various expensive ships to upgrade into. As a trade you could eventually buy a huge freighter to carry large amounts of cargo.\n\nPew Pew – The space battle is simple, maybe a bit too much so but fun and fast paced regardless. There are weapons that will auto fire, and others you choose to fire at the right time for the best effect. You’ll need to run if the group of pirates out guns you, and death comes very easily so be cautious.\n\nWhat I disliked:\n\nIn this economy – The numbers in the game seem a bit skewed towards failure in terms of the financial progress and upgrade potential. I found that during the roguelike difficulty the space stations were charging my trader 500 credits plus damage repair to land, in the normal mode it was a much more reasonable 250 credits. In the rougelike difficulty I found myself flat broke and unable to land to offload goods effectively ending my game each time that happened. In both modes a substantial upgrade of a ship felt like it would take a long period of time to obtain. That says something for replay value but gaining money takes time, possibly too much to risk all your money on roguelike difficulty.\n\nChaos ensues – The combat may be relatively easy in terms of ship control, but it’s chaotic and confusing at times. I found myself accidentally hitting friendly ships with missiles or shooting at a pirate far too powerful for my weapons. The user interface could really be improved in this aspect, knowledge of your opponent’s power levels is an essential component with a large space travel game.\n\nI found this to be a very pleasant and fun open world space adventure. The combat is fun and fast paced, the roguelike aspect adds replay and freshness, and the economy is deep and follows real time dynamic events. There are a number of big 3d space sims on the market, many of which I enjoy and have hundreds of hours into, so this is a nice change of pace while remaining in a genre that many of us love to explore. I highly recommend picking this one up if you enjoy space adventures. Star Nomad 2 is lightweight enough to trick you into hours of flight thinking you’re playing a quick space game, it’s deep, engaging, and quite fun.\n\nScore: Buy it now","December 14, 2015","true","13.3"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","22","33","2","5"

Been playing it and enjoying it immensely so far. It shares some gameplay similarities swith SPAZ, Void Expanse, and Endless Sky.\n\nThe skill and module systems really do make a significant difference in how a ship performs in a given role. Early on, I went the route of utility and speed, and my corvette (the lightest class of ship) was soon easily outmaneuvering even enemy corvettes. The choices are permanent, with no option to respec, so it forces you to consider all your options and plan it out, though I haven't encountered a "level cap" thus far, so it seems like eventually you'll be able to allocate points in most if not everything.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very fluid, especially in how the ships handle. With a bit of practice and well timed use of the hyperdrive boost, even a larger ship can manually dodge incoming fire. Starting out can be a bit rough for newcomers though, as the starter ship is very weak offensively, and the game employs a killing-blow system for awarding experience and money. One thing that bothered me early on was the lack of smaller-scale encounters. Most of the time, pirates enter a system in groups of 6 or more, which will easily make short work of you if you try to stand and fight them on your own. There were very few occasions where I got to fight a smaller skirmish like a 1v1 or 1v2 dogfight. The exception to this seems to be if you play as a pirate yourself (which I haven't tried yet) and attack merchants traveling the outskirts of systems, since they are usually alone, or in a pair occasionally.\n\nOne mechanic that I rather enjoy, though I could easily see it being a major source of frustration for others, is the friendly-fire system. Thankfully, you and your squadmates can't hit each other, and ALLIED(not merely non-hostile) faction's weapons will go through you harmlessly, but your shots (with the exception of missiles locked on a target) can and will still hit them. By default, your turret weapons are set to auto-fire on your selected target, or the nearest hostile if you don't have anything targeted. Most of the time, they are very accurate at leading their targets, but they don't take into account other ships that happen to be in the line of fire, causing things to get ugly quickly when there are multiple combatants involved. The solution to this is to either meticulously maneuver yourself constantly to keep a clear line of fire, or switch to manual aiming mode. Carefully picking and timing your shots to avoid FF is the obvious perk to this method, but there is also added incentive in the fact that weapons drain 25% less energy when fired manually. If specced and outfitted properly, this allows you maintain weapons-fire almost indefinitely while manuevering, and thus rewarding skillful gunners.\n\nOn the other hand, I just discovered that, while seemingly weak on paper, drones are very effective as both and offensive and defensive tool. They are very good at drawing fire away from you, and in large numbers can whittle targets down while avoiding most incoming damage. Their AI is surprisingly pretty good when left to their own devices. It seems the developer has taken great pains to ensure several different viable playstyles, which is refreshing to see.\n\nI find the game's cyberpunk-esque artstyle rather quaint, and the visual effects are simple but pleasant. The music is also pretty good in general, with different themes ranging from techno-style combat music to get the blood pumping during pirate raids, epic themes for those massive interfaction sieges, brooding, ominous themes while exploring lawless territory, and so on. The UI has its quirks, especially in its "efficiency" approach. Sometimes, the lack of confirmation for actions can lead to costly mistakes in the store, or say, instantly quitting the game while trying to back out of a menu, and thus losing unsaved progress. This has already been addressed by others, and the developer was quick to respond. Speaking of which, the developer has been lightning-quick to respond to pretty much everything on the forums, which is nice to see, though I wonder if he will make any progress on the upcoming updates with as much time as he seems to spend answering posts :p","December 16, 2015","true","64.4"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","13","17","2","1"

That can go wrong in many ways, but this time it went in all the good places. When I read the information about the game I wasn't sure if it could be as good as it seemed, and then I found out it was made by a single passionate developer. How can something like this turn out good? Well it bloody well can, and it did!\n\nThis game does right what it promises. It's a game that on rogue like mode will test you to the limit, as single mistake will result in your imediate death! (Normal mode is in no way punnishing, and I would recommend it for those who want to enjot the ride)\n\nSo what exactly is good about the game? 2 factors:\nEconomy: Oh yes, I do mean economy it's more than just selling high buying low. You'r trading will have effect on the game! you like the one guys, but those other dudes ♥♥♥♥ you off? Take time and smuggle drugs to the later and lure pirates to their systems, while brining guns and technology to your favrorites. It seems unreal? Belive me it actually works as intended, and that brings me to second factor!\n\nEmergent, evolving gameplay: So as I mentioned you lured the pirates in, and you are swimming in the money. Well the pirates atraccted bounty hunters... The situation starts to get crazy.. But hey what could happen next. BOOM ancient AI come rushing into the system with their overpowered pew pew lasors, and shoot you of the sky! No really, that's what can happen in this game, and you will love it! If it sound cool to you, belive me that's how it works and you will love it.\n\nBut senpai what about the controlls, and graphics!\nControls are tight and responsive, the game runs well even with mass of enemies on screen, so you can snipe the ships of the air in a fluent 60 FPS\n\nPresentetion: As far as me I like it, but watch the gameplays and decide for yourself. I'm not good at juding graphics so I'm not going to pretend that I can do that. The lasors shine, and missles blow the ♥♥♥♥ up so I'm jazzed :D\n\nWith pure heart, I recommend this game to anyone who loves space games. I feel like anyone will find something for themselves!\n\n*Yes you can mine* *Yes it's a good way to make income*  *yes you will be in danger in the asteroids belts, so take some lasors with you *wink**\n\nAnd here is my gameplay from the game :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWT8rOz-dco","December 15, 2015","true","9.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xcutex/recommended/414950/","xcutex","XcuteX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xcutex/","37 products in account","TL;DR This is a 2-D space game with upgradeable ships and NPC allies. Clever AI and general tedium keeps the game interesting. There was 1 bug found in the first 48 hours by the community, instead of 1000. The way the AI flies leads to insanecrazy space battles! The maker could charge $20-25 and most people who have it would pay the price. Oh, and you die a lot at the beginning.\n\nLong Version:\n\nGraphics: It's 2-D, so don't expect Call of Duty graphics. But they're acceptable, similar to Gratuitous Space Battles. Turrets go on mounts and nothing looks clunky.\n\nSound: A bit repetitive. I just play music for myself instead, so I'm probably not the best judge.\n\nAI: This is where the game shines. You do so much in this game that generally doesn't happen. You help NPC allies win battles, and I mean "help" because you are not a force of nature and the NPCs factions are fighting each other way more than piddly 'ole YOU. Compare that to most games where you're basically fighting the enemy solo and your allies only exist as meat shields or to make it harder so you have to defend them. The computer also flies in such a way that every battle is a dogfight and you don't know where they'll go, keeps you on your toes. This is way better than X3 (for those who played) where the AI flies at you, then flies away, turns around, and does it again.\n\nCombat (AI2): Combat is structured such that you're rarely a one-ship army. There's huge strength in numbers, and luckily your allies are in many places for you to fight with! There is one problem with friendly fire reducing faction standing by a lot, though that might have already been taken care of. You do a lot of team fighting and kill stealing is a big mechanic in the early game.\n\nExploration: All the systems in the game are known, and the maps are fully explored when you're in system. The reason you explore is to find out what is sold at each station, where you can get that big gun, new ship or new crew member. You can dock on enemy stations, but not while in combat. So you have to be wily to land on a hostile station. This all makes the exploration aspect a lot more engaging.\n\nShips: There are about 30 or so in game, more to be added. They differ by speed, durability, and equippable weapons, essentially. There's enough overlap that each ship doesn't feel so unique as to be alien, but enough distinction to  make you think about choosing your next ship, how it'll blend with your play style, and who you have to kiss up to, to get permission to buy the ship.\n\nThe Dev's name is Halfgeek, the other half is insomniac. He's probably up around 30 hours a day listening to feedback and making improvements. He replies to just about every message in the flood of messages. Pretty good.\n\nUltimately, as long as you're ok with 2-D graphics, and if you're into space games AT ALL, I'd say it's worth it. (If you do, it's got a steep learning curve, head to the discussions page to get some of the key tips!)","December 16, 2015","true","86.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","12","16","2","0"

There's SO MUCH going on in this game! It's a sandbox, a truly open-ended enviroment that evolves as you play, offering you a ton of possibilities. A universe that is a joy to tinker with, to see how it reacts to your choices. I just can't put it down; ever since Huy Phan offered me the chance to play it, I've been hooked.\n\nThere's this whole universe full of systems containing colonized worlds and huge spacehubs. Three major factions (Human Empire, Starborn Federation and Omni Collective) are fighting for the control of said universe while the minor factions (Mercenaries Guild, Merchants Guild, Pirates Guild) orbit this whole ordeal and try to make do. This is not just shallow lore, they're ACTUALLY fighting for the control of the systems. The universe is not static, NPCs keep on doing their thing while you decide if you want to go mining some rare ores for that drone-oriented module you saw in the Omni Collective region or if you'll help one of the Starborn Federation colonies that is having a civil unrest situation by delivering pleasure sims.\n\nI started my last playthrough in a lowly ship, with some unimpressive modules/weapons installed and little money in my pocket. I wanted a better ship, better modules, I wanted to join Omni Collective and help them take over the whole universe because I'm into their way of seeing things. Bounty-hunting I went, visiting systems that were being raided by pirates, killing them and collecting their bounties and loot. Sometimes I would do some trading between systems, helping to resolve, for example, a food crisis in a colony and making lots of money out of the deal. There were times I did some ninja mining too, hoping to not been seen by the pirates or, worse, the Zerkers, while I got my cargo full of rare ores. While I did all of that my pilot gained a lot of experience which went to skills oriented to drone fighting, later a random encounter made me go to one of the pirates' colonies where I met my first squadmate. You can do pretty much anything you want in this game, the way you want.","December 15, 2015","true","27.4"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

Whether it be randomized quests, randomized dungeon or map layouts, branching character progression, or just getting my character a new haircut.  If a game offers most of the above, I'll take it.\n\nStar Nomad manages to offer a level of dynamism and shifting scenery without actually shifting the scenery.  The map is the same everytime, and you're only given a handful of character slots (one for each playstyle, presumably: Merchant, Bounty Hunter, or Pirate.)  To top it off, you're only given a few choices of character portraits.  This is usually a huge barrier for me, as I like making my virtual me just the way I want it.  Nevertheless, Nomad 2 breaks through this barrier easily with emergent storylines, and I hardly ever notice my character's portrait, though I'm mousing over it occasionally to check his stats.\n\nThere's no 'real' linear story to the game, but that's what sets it apart from most in the arpg-spacesim genre.  You're free to do what you want.  For my part, I played a pirate, setting my sights on the fattest of the empires until they start to crumble, and then switch to attack the next one that appears to be getting too big for it's britches.  Want to be an unscrupulous smuggling merchant, peddling drugs and guns to all the disparate colonies around the galaxy?  Done.  And while you're at it, have fun with the consequences, because every trade has it's drawbacks and effects.\n\nThere are interesting events such as viral outbreaks, rebellions, blockades, full-blown space battles between factions.  And you can inject your character, whatever he may be, into it however you like.  Run food through a pirate blockade for huge payoff (and risk if you play hard or rogue-like mode.)\n\nWhile I'm on the subject of roguelikes, this is not one, though it may bill itself as such.  Really more of a persistent, single-player space sim with some options for soft permadeath.  In other words, the Rogue-like mode takes away all your things, leaving you with only your body and your bank account, which you can then use to buy a new ship.  If you don't have enough, well then I guess that's actual permadeath, and your character can live out his days herding nerf and praying against orbital destruction.\n\nThe music is appropriately spacey in sound, with guitar riffs that sound like like an old space-rock band.\n\nI've only scratched the surface in my own playthrough as a pirate, but look forward to trying my hand at bounty hunting.  I tried merchant play but to be honest it was a bit bland and tedious, though your mileage may vary.  The interesting part of being a merchant is projecting what places will buy certain items for the most amount of money.  Joining the merchants guild and rising through the ranks can give you an edge in that it will outright tell you how much profit or losses you stand to make running guns from Eon to Betelgeuse.\n\nAnyway, in short, good space sim.   It's actually surprised me how much I've been wanting a game like this and hadn't realised that all the other titles I tried were just not fitting the bill.  The developer is very active in the community and in development, with patches coming every few weeks by the looks of it.  I look forward to the future of this franchise.","February 1","true","16.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

I'll list out some outstanding features it has that you might want to consider when thinking of buying this game. Scroll down if you don't wish to read for tid-bits.\n\n1) It is a top-down space-shooter-simulation. It has 30+ systems, 3 factions, pirates, bounty hunters (crazy guys) and zerkers (mechanoid aliens). Trade is vital in this game, as it affects more than just your wallet, but the faction strength you're trading in.\n\n2) You control where you want to shoot, or, let the AI decide for you. I decided to control myself as the game provides a nice bonus to energy saved if you do it manually (Energy is used in firing weapons, engaging engine thrust, hyperdrive etc) It could be challenging at the beginning, but the controls can be easily mastered within a couple of hours.\n\n3) Death is especially agonizing in "Roguelike" mode where you lose your ship and cargo. Just you and your bank account is left, with an empty new small corvette that you start with. If you like a challenge this is for you. It all depends on your piloting skill and Common sense. E.g. Not a good idea to fly right into a fleet of ships guns blazing.\n\n4) Dev is active and helpful. He engages with the community members and rolls out their ideas. Fixes are frequent too, definitely a + for me.\n\n5) This game reminds me of one of my fav space games, Space Rangers with Manual controls. If you like that one you would like this.\n\n6) There are no "Bases" to build or purchase however. And the pirate faction is just being...piraty. I believe the Dev will be working on them soon.\n\n7) Once you begin to upgrade the different modules of your ship (and perhaps buy a bigger one) you can finally throw yourself into some Faction vs Faction action. A screen full of beams, plasma, kinetic shots and missiles is definitely breath-taking. Press Space to pause to catch your breath.\n\nI recommend anyone playing this game to have fun dying. It is all part of the learning curve, and the normal difficulty have no penalties at all.\n\nShort-list of features\n\nTop-down\nSelf-controlled navigation\n30+ systems with wormholes acting as portals\nFly Spaceships From Corvettes to the latest elusive Dreadnought (found only in Roguelike diffculty)\nSkill tree\nSquadmates\nHas Beams, Plasma, Railgun(Kinectic)\nTrading (or sabotaging with drugs) affects the system, which in turns affect faction strength","January 17","true","74.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

It's like a 2D version of X3 and/or Elite dangerous and that's a good thing!\n\nI've been wanting to play a game like this ever since I played a game called ''Fusion Genesis'' on the Xbox 360 arcade which is also a 2D space exploration game with factions but no trading system.\n\nThere is quite a lot to like about this game but here are a few of my highlights. I'll start with how the trading system, the wars between rival factions and the planets needs are actively changing even when you are not in the same sector. The world feels very alive even when you are not a part of the action!\n\nNow the action. When you do get yourself involved in the middle of a faction war, (sometimes not by choice) it can be absolutely frantic! It takes a while to adapt to the situation that arises but once you learn each of the eneny factions' patterns and gear yourself up, you can eventually overcome unlikely odds and it's really rewarding!\n\nSpeaking of gear, there is plenty! These include: new ships, turrets, missiles, drones, abillities and bonus stats! With this you also have a perk tree which as you level up through killing tradig etc, will earn you skill points which you can allocate to your preference if you meet the points spent requirements. This leaves room for plenty of unique builds to suit your playstyle.\n\nOther things I like about this game is the visuals. It's very striking and each of the sectors has a beautiful background. I'd also like to mention that it's easy to see where you are in the world and where shots are fired which makes the game very fair.\n\nNow to one of my absolute favourite parts of this game. The music. There is plenty of variety and it suits the world really well but what I absolutely love is when you engage in a battle with an enemy and then the music switches up to really hype you up!\n\n________________________________________________________________\nAll in all, I definitely recommend you give this game a go and I do think there is plenty of replay value especially for the price you pay for it. I haven't even got halfway into my goals and still have a lot to learn.\n\nI'd also like to mention that the developer of this game has been amazing!

It reminds me of Escape Velocity Nova.\n\nThe in-game galaxy is split up into a number of systems. Many systems have planets that the player can buy and sell resources from. Other systems have asteroids that the player can mine.\n\nThere are 3 factions that are at war with each other. There is also one neutral faction and a few minor factions such as pirates or bounty hunters. The player may align with or oppose most factions. The player's actions can cause a faction to be friendly or hostile towards the player.\n\nWarring factions gain and lose territory over time. The player may aid one of the warring factions in galactic conquest.\n\nThe economy is highly dynamic. Various resource crises can occur. The player can aid or hinder a faction's economy. One fun thing to do is smuggling drugs into an opposing faction's world. This can cause economic destitution and encourage piracy.\n\nShips come in different sizes and some ships can only be obtained by being loyal to specific factions. Ships' weapons and defenses can be customized. Weapon types are turrets, missiles, and drones. These types are further broken down into more specific categories such as kinetic, plasma, energy, and others.\n\nCombat is easy to jump into and fun. Destruction of an enemy target depends on who gets the last hit. This may sound like a negative, but it actually lowers the barrier of entry for engaging in combat and it makes it more strategic. Even a lowly merchant ship can jump into a large fire fight and "scavenge" a kill.\n\nThere are RPG and RTS element to this game. The player can find a few squad members during their journey. They can command their squad members and level up their skills. The player also has skills that can be leveled up.\n\nThere are random events that can lead to minor quests. Squad member also have quests. Unfortunately, factions do not have storylines and the minor quests do not really chain together to form something larger.\n\nOverall, the game is lots of fun and I highly recommend it to space sim fans.","January 15","true","35.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

And once you get going, you're literally swimming in money you have nothing to really spend it on except rearming.\n\nTL;DR Fun, fast paced (combat) space sim, deep trading system that is super simple to understand (and exploit), and lots of variation in weapons, ships, skills and factions so no 2 runs have to be the same.\n\nThis game is NOT what I expected, and I'm very pleased it delivered so magnificently on every thing it does.  Halfgeek or Huy did a spectacular job with this game.  I love the fact that even though it's a 2D game, it factors in the 3D of space by adding the evasion stat!  The factions are drastically different, and each of their ships not only have their own variations between factions but also within! (You like fast, nimble ships? Starborn ships are basically the equivalent of the ship grade below, but can take less dmg.  Wanna be super beefy? Omni ships have no shields but regen hull HP AND get better dmg resistances just for being Omni!)  There's 3 selections of "profession" in the beginning, and while I've only really experienced the hunter in depth, the pirate seems feasible too.  You can play this however you like.\n\nThe weapons have a nice balance, the ships are well done, and the overall balance of the game is fantastic.  You may run into trouble with one faction or another due to your weapon types, but with a little research, a little money, and some experimentation, there's nothing this game throws at you that you can't take.  The faction standing system is well thought out, and adds a great kind of currency that makes you really work for it.\n\nOverall, this game is good.  Not great, but enjoyable, replayable, and madly entertaining for how, for lack of a better word, repetative the gameplay is (which I normally abhor, but the whole fight, loot, sell, and fight some more works).  It's a little lacking in the RPG aspect.  The skills of the pilot you play and the team you recruit are well done, but there's not a lot of "story" to the game, so if you're looking for that, this game isn't it.  Not to say there isn't some good story-telling going on here, the NPC quests are well done, if a bit short.\n\nThe devs, who are responsive and play this game probably as much as any of us will (Halfgeek responded to my review the day I put it up!) are currently working in new content despite the game being "finished" (first major addition after I picked this title up were a whole new class of ship for one of the factions that drastically change the way you fight!).  So all in all, this game is superb.  The asking price is a PITTANCE for what they could be charging and still receiving.  Don't let the looks or the low price tag fool you, this game has moxy, guts, spunk and a few cans of whoop ♥♥♥ waiting to be opened!\n\nFirst Glance:\nI want to start off by saying I bought this for the relatively low price and expected to get something that would hold my interest for brief periods at a time.  To my very pleasant surprise this game is great.  There's not a lot of hand holding or tutorial, it plays like an 80s/90s game where you have to read the "instructions" (and this made a massive difference in my success after taking the time to read it).  I don't have a lot of hours in this, and I'm not very far either, but it is wildly fun, despite the fact that the encounters (at least thus far) don't have a lot of variation to them.  The selection of ships, weapons, types of weapons, modules skills and so on is downright impressive, varied and a lot of freaking fun.  The only complaint I have is the ore currency is a little confusing.  If you try and mine it, it's unclear if you've obtained any before docking at a port, which sucks because it costs you 250 (which, yes, is a pittance once you're going and on a roll).  I'd also like a little more detail in the planet descriptions when you scroll over in the map to help with understanding purchasing ships/loadouts (like the fact that a "capital" planet will have the best ships for that faction, but the best weapons will be at say a research facility or factory planet or so on).   The one serious complaint I actually have is the fact that the random encounter that is supposed to send you to go get your first squad member is well, not a have to do thing.  I thought the guy was setting me up for a trap and declined to go!  But otherwise, this game is a lot of fun for anyone who likes space sims with squad set ups.  Anyone who's played the Star Wolves games should enjoy this, but maybe not quite as much as those games.","January 15","true","44.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

It's a fresh take on the classic isometric 4x space genre, and unlike a lot of modern games which try to throw new players into the action with fast progression and easy credits it takes the old school approach of dumping you into the middle of the universe as a nobody with a crappy ship and a handful of credits. Every milestone you reach and new ship you buy gives you a nice sense of accomplishment because you know you clawed your way up from the bottom to get there.\n\nIn terms of combat the developer has managed to make a system that's often rather simple into something that feels very tactical with the addition of a few simple features like manual turret aiming and segmented shields. Instead of just brawling it out you'll find yourself leading your shots, rotating your ship against fire to protect damaged sections and pulsing your afterburner to weave away from bullets, all while desperately competing for the kill against other pilots.\n\nOne of the really cool and unique features of the game is that all of your actions have an impact on the universe. Even as a peaceful trader you can watch a faction use the boosted economy gained from your trade runs to go on the warpath. Everything you do has a ripple effect.\n\nI bought it on a whim and after a few hours I felt like I was a 9 year old kid sneaking into my dad's office to play escape velocity in the middle of the night again. It has that addictive 'just one more trade run' 'just one more pirate hunt' kind of feel and after playing for 2 days I feel like I've only scratched the surface of it's content.

Like kill endlessly respawning ships, moving goods around mean nothing because there's nothing behind it.\n\nStar Nomad 2 is one of the few spacesims where your actions make a difference in the gameworld, like trading with a faction makes them prosperous or destroying Pirate raids lead to more merchant activity and helping the faction grow stronger and they conquer others.\n\nI'm a smuggler, dropping drugs on unsuspecting colonies, getting them all addicted & unproductive! It's funny seeing an entire faction crumble due to me hauling drugs to their worlds.\n\nThere's very little hand-holding going on, which can be good and bad, depending on whether you want to think and make your own story or progress on goals. It would be bad if you want the game to give you objectives or goals and you follow it.\n\nThe Star Map in the game is excellent, simple but it provides all the info you need to decide where to go to further your Pilot's career. It provides info on which goods the worlds export and import, it tells you if there's a major trade shortage, like rioters demanding fresh Playthings (yes, think naughty robots!) or some kind of alien outbreak and the people want weapons.\n\nIf you're a Hunter, the Star Map also shows all the bounty opportunities.\n\nOne major thing you should know, the game has a "Killing Blow" system for bounties. If you don't get the last kill shot, you get no rewards whatsoever. There's no "hey, I helped you kill that Pirate, gimme something!"...  it took a few bounties before I got used to it.

Trading is interesting and effects the world around you.  All in all it's a good game with some quality of life issues that need sorting out.  Luckily the developer seems to be active and working on things.  Rogue-Like mode is why I got the game.  It's certainly challenging and you have to play the game differently than you might otherwise have to.  Staying out of the middle of the fighting and picking off the weak ships or ships that are about to go down is a must at the beginning.  Getting reputation with the different factions is a must.  It not only allows you to buy better ships, but it also makes landing on there planets cheaper.  I failed to understand that my first few hours.  Getting faction reputation makes fighting and being a merchant much easier.\n\nThe Cons:\n\nUsing missiles doesn't seem to be worth the amount you get back from the bounty, making them cost ineffective.  When firing my missile I find myself wondering why I'm even firing it, because I'm pretty much not going to make any money.\n\nNPC's fly off the screen a lot, which you are unable to do.  This means NPCs will get the bounty because bounties are based on last hit, screwing you out of money.  I yelled at the screen so many times over this problem.\n\nAll in all I could see myself playing the game more, if some of these problems were fixed.  I could have played the game on easy, but that would have been too boring.\n\nAlso every single mission I ran across in game ended up just getting me killed.  The one time I did complete a mission fighting pirates I got no visible extra reward.  I recommend staying away from missions entirely until you get a squad.\n\nThe log which appears at the bottom left of the screen is timed and there is no possible way to access anything that happened after a battle to see exactly what kills you got or exactly what happened with a mission.","February 14","true","13.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","11"

Since then space games have always held a special place in my heart. Recently I had an itch to find a game to put my time into over my winter break, as my college gives us a full month. I tried a free game called Endless Sky, it's free to play. I recommend that game as well. Then I found Star Nomad 2. Everything Endless Sky was trying to accomplish in it's game Star Nomad 2 had already done and then some. The only thing the two games share in common is the level of customization. The depth that SN2 takes the aspects of it's game is very impressive. Halfgeek, the developer of SN2, is an amazing designer. Not only is the game already great, but the content just keeps coming. Even if you find some aspects of the game you don't enjoy Halfgeek is consistently patrolling the community forums replying to suggestions and helping new players learn the ropes.\n\nGameplay in SN2 is as complicated as you make it. You can let the CPU fire your turrets for you, or you can fire them yourself (firing the turrets yourself saves energy that you can use for a speed boost). You can fly lone wolf, or slowly compile a squad of unique characters that have their own stories to tell. You can be a corvette loaded to the teeth with missles and run circles around larger ships, or play a larger ship and laugh as your drones tear apart everything in the sector. The gameplay is only limited by the amount of time you have to put in, as this game does involve some grind for reputation with certain factions to aquire their ships. Traveling in the game can be a chore, as larger ships must move slower. There isn't much of a fast travel system to you end up spending some time trying to boost thought empty systems. This is slightly rememdied by the random encounter system or roaming pirate/pirate hunters. The difficulty in this game is also quite customizable as you it has a rouge-like setting for those that like "it hurts so good" gameplay. OR if you're like me and Dark Souls is how you get that fix and other games tend to be more casual, then you can pick hard or easy mode.\n\nThe story in SN2 is relatively shallow overall. The premise is there and laid out. There's just enough story to let players make a moral decision on who to support and why three factions are constantly at each other's throats. I personally prefer this over a convoluted story for a game like this. I'd rather there be more content gameplay wise for this game as there is only one developer that I am aware of. With only one person to write the story, the issue of them "ruining" it by implementing an idea that sounds good them them but ends up resonating poorly with the community is a very possible situation. The story as it stands now is more than adequate. As mentioned before there's just enough for the players to understand what is happening, why it's happening, and what should they do.\n\nThe full price of this game is very justified at this time. The amount of content and updates the game has recieved since I've purchased the game is on level with triple A titles DLC's.

The game presents itself as an open-world sandbox, which I think it does accomplish, since it allows many different activities to be done. Moreover, I feel like it is a seamless world, where I am just another piece, not the main hero which destroys anything in it's path without any difficulty. Improving both the character & the ship are time-consuming tasks, but at the same time I don't feel it's a grind, since I find the game's combat system to be entrhalling. I also enjoy the dynamic trade system. I've got to admit that although very enjoyable, the game could do with some aggregates & new features, but as it is, the game has a very good base from which to expand & improve, and it must be taken into account that the game has been developed by only 1 person (Halfgeek).\n\nHighlights:\n-----------\n-Somewhat open-world game, with different activities to be done.\n-Immersive atmosphere, soundtrack, music & characters.\n-Amazing work for having been developed by only one person.\n-Halfgeek, the developer, is the most dedicated indie developer I know. He really works a lot for the game to thrive, answers extremely quickly & takes into account all bugs reported, as well as suggestions and comments.\n-Fun & enthralling experience.\n-Trading & combat systems that aren't too simple nor complicated, they are just right.\n-As it is, the game is a great foundation from which to expand, since a lot of features can be taken into account & added to open-world sandbox type games.","December 21, 2015","true","15.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

I wanted to like it, I wanted to play, I wanted to support the developer. But sadly, I find nothing in this game calling to me to play again.\n\nSince you have probably done a lot of research about the game I'll speak to some game breakers for me.\n\nCombat: It's nice for like 2 minutes. But then you realize in a fight with more than like 4-5 ships, you end up hitting allied ships ALL the time OR you can't get a shot in. In a 2d SPACE game, I would recommend the developer disable friendly fire, because of screen real estate. SPACE IS HUGE. But 2d space on a monitor, only has limited room. So there is nothing unrealistic about turning off friendly fire, and letting your shots pass through allies, just think of it as you being above or below the current plane of fighting.\n\nBut to enable friendly fire, on a 2d game, where such space is limited to your current screen resolution, and then put friendly units all over in a fleet fight, means you hit them all the time. Or yo don't fire and you don't get recognition. Because this game goes by killing blow, not by how much damage you contributed to the target.\n\nThe next thing is that although there are like 30 systems to visit, space is small. You can fly a sector 'edge to edge' in less than 30 seconds. Not sure why the developer would 'instance' space like that in a 2d space game since you can have endless space and it doesn't require any more resource. He's just limited the screen space you play in.\n\nNext, when enemy ships fly off the edge of the screen they cannot be seen! So you're fighting near the top/bottom/left/right side of the screen? Enemy can fly off the side and you can't even shoot at them. Because ya don't know where they are since you can't see them!\n\nThe game had a lot of potiential and I seriously looked forward to it, in a geeky kind of way, but I am let down and very disappointed by some of the design decisions, which I feel gimps the game.\n\nI seriously tried to like it, but I cannot bring myself to even attempt to play it any longer.\n\nIf you can overlook what I have said above, sure get it. If you can't get a demo for it, then I suggest leaving it out. I will seek a refund. Although I really wanted to support this. But in the end with those design decisions, it really isn't the kind of game I am looking for. It's more an instanced space invaders with trading.\n\nIf you read other thumbs down reviews, you will see a lot of what I mentioned, plus other things I agree with. The game might be fun for a limited time AFTER you have grinded the best ship for 40 hours.

Except you can't, you have to click on the mercenary dialogue box that's exactly the same everytime and contrute nothing to the experience. And you have to click right within the box, not just anywhere on the screen even all the button on screen are locked and not clickable.\n\nNow imagine this happen every single time you trade, you pickup loot in space, you dock, bascially every interaction.\n\nFor the game itself the map is dynamic and got elements to play with, but what a player can do is really limited and will get bored real soon when there are so much potential. The battle is really mediocre and the last shot claim the full bounty and exp is really a turn down even you did 99.9% of the damage. And the random event don't felt like random, more like a queue that is extremely repetitive and way too frequent.\n\nI certainlly hope that they will improve this game to a more finished level than currently is, and i will update this review if so.\n\nThe price is not expensive but it should be left in early access/beta for what it offer right now.","April 30","false","3.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Unfortunatly to get access to the more advanced ships you need to supply rare resources which would be ok if you could buy them but it seems you can't so your only option is to mine them. For me mining is rather tedious so I'm locked out of the more advanced ships. Maybe if it gets modded in the future I may change my review but for now I have lost all interest in the game.","April 1","false","10.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","3"

However its the little painfully stupid things that kept poking and then eventually cracking me. It amazes me how little it takes to make what would otherwise be a decent game to instead be a nightmare.\n\nNot 30 seconds after leaving the starting world I died. Large amount of brown and red ships descended upon me and made me go boom in seconds. Later I learned that your initial foes, the pirates and the zerkers, both wield massive fleets that wreck everything in their path. Manage to kill a few of them? You then better not die, because as soon as you do the enemy counts reset, so you can essentially battle forever in the same system. Thankfully death costs nothing, but sadly if you want to actually kill anything you have to spend vast amounts of money on missiles. Your turrets might as well be pea shooters. So you are left with the choice of either not fighting and flying around the masses hoping to not get noticed and pick up some scraps, do some mind numbing trading, or go asteroid mining which involves pressing a button every few seconds.\n\nIll keep at it as I have nothing better to do at the moment, but for newcommers I recommend staying away for now unless youre willing to suffer for some possible enjoyment later. Oh and the zerkers shooting through your shields? Yeah, thats a "negative review" feature right there.","December 21, 2015","false","16.4"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","2","9","0","4"

It's not fun and the videos and positive reviews make it seem you can do all these epic things, fleet battles, grand adventures...\n\nAll of it is repetitve and very slow. You will waste lots of time trying to "have fun" because all the tools you need to "have fun" are gated and restricted- the bigger ships like Frigates, Cruisers, even better weapons require atrocious amounts of credits AND large amounts of two special ores that take a lot of time to get.\n\nIn addition, you have to grind faction rep too and the game has this bounty credit system where it doesn't matter how much you contribute to a fight, just if you get the last hit in to kill so it wastes even more of your precious time.\n\nTerrible game and if you play this, you will waste more than just $12+ dollars, you will waste precious hours of your life that could've been spent enjoying better things or learning a job skill, new hobby.","December 20, 2015","false","3.1"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","4","14","0","2"

Not anywhere near as fun as I would have hoped. Everything is competently presented......there simply isn't enough to do! Trading is not fun or in any way in-depth. Combat isn't much fun either with the number one annoyance really being your allies all too readily kill-steal. This leads to much frustation and is not something I am accustomed to in my space-trade-combat type games. Your weaponry always feel woefully underpowered to everyone elses.\n\nYes, there are better weapons in the game. Some of which, even if you have the money, can't be readily accessed as you need minerals to even buy them, for some reason, and these can be obtained one of two ways. Either combat, where you have to land the killing blow, so good luck with that, or through mining. This invovles buying an upgrade for your ship that allows mining and then praying your lone ship doesn't get attacked by 8 other ships that will then roundly whip you.\n\nThe playing areas, which encompass each "system" consists of a central planet or station and then some some jump points dotted around ther edges of this map, typically the corners. This is the same for every system I visited so no variation here either so exploration has no value to it.\n\nAll in all a very disappointing title. Yes, it's only £9.99, or £8.99 at the moment, and I've had my enjoyment from the title if you want to break it down into the crudest terms possible of cost per hours fun. But at least half of those 7 hours was me fighting the game rather than having fun playing with it.","December 24, 2015","false","7.5"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","1","8","0","1"

This game should too. Taking it off early access is fraud. They will most likely not finish this game any more than they did star nomad 1.\n\nI tell you about my experience playing it. I start the game as a trader. I can carry 40 things. It takes me 10 minutes to be able to carry the maximum of the most expensive stuff. The next step? There is a ship that can carry 60. But I would have to grind for 8 hours to buy it, and it is slower, and it already takes forever to fly between planets. The other kickers were: docking fees take 25% of my profits, the price when I arrived at my destination was typically down by 50% (profit) from when I left my starting point, need faction standing to buy better ships, which I can only get my blowing their enemies. So I try being a fighter since trader is pointless. But to get credit for a kill, I have to deliver that one fatal shot or I get zip. But I don't do much damage so most battles I just get the consolation prize for being in the system when they won. Of I die like bug squat since I have a tiny ship, which can't outrun anything. So if my allies die, I can only watch while 4-5 ships close in and blow me up. Then I get to fly half way across the galaxy (yet again) because the starting faction's ships suck. Can I go somewhere with enemies on my level to get stronger then come back? No such place. So since I'm not a masochist I edit my save game (like the author says you can), to get to a tier 2 ship. Now I get some kills, but can't dodge anything at all. So the ships larger than me still kill me a good percentage of the time. There is no intelligent progression. This is a waste of your time.","February 10","false","6.2"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","11","1","9","3","9"
