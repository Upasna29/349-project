There's loads of stuff going-on, most of which is poorly explained and what IS explained is arguably even more obscure.  It's glitchy and clunky and every single model clips through every single other model and effects fire randomly and moving stuff around inventory/quickbars is almost entirely potluck based (equipping things has an RNG!!) and so much more...\n\nProps to whoever put this thing together - no lack of ambition shown, but it's NOT a game ready to be sold to people by any means...","November 12, 2015","false","0.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

It is a bit expensive considering the lack of polish though. Examples of lack of polish include the very amateur-looking fonts and menus, lack of tutorial and the fact you can't turn off the annoying slowmo that seems to happen randomly in battles for tactical or cinematic purposes. Also it does seem a bit hard to work out what is going on, at least at first, as all the enemy monsters and your monsters get jumbled up.\n\nBasically what I'm saying is, at 75% off this is worth it; if they don't polish it up then it's probably not worth the full or -10% price, but don't dismiss the game as "utter trash" like a lot of people have: there is a real, stat, spell, loot-filled game under the rough exterior.","July 2, 2015","true","0.4"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","13","22","0","0"

Dota styled (single player) combat for the outposts.\n\nSo after playing the game for 4 hours i can say the game is good for one guy doing it. Its fun and can be hard the UI is pretty hard to get used to very hard to heal when all units are grouped up. Gameplay is unique it is like homm but just real time. Units are unique have power and spells only that unit has. For a small indie game by one guy its pretty well done.\n\nSNow area is where its like dota u need to build turrets and fill up barracks with units than it will spawn creep waves based on stack of units in the barracks..after understanding the moba elements in the game its no so bad. just get over the whole AAA stigma you want this game to have. Can it be better well yes but could it be worse and thats a yes as well. Overall its a fun deotur from the normal games in this genre its unique and different in good ways. Rough but not bad.\n\nI would say if your curious watch some videos and do some research its functional and works which is more than what i can so for alot of AAA titles recently. Its obvious from the start its a single mans game cuz its rough but by no means unplayable or bad just lacks polish but in the end its different and unique and if u like homm or kings bounty it is very similar.","July 1, 2015","true","4.3"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","8","19","2","0"
