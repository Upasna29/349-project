I got quite badly stuck at the end fight in this one and had to completely restart again in order to rectify the problem. You are going to need a companion to help you out so when the option comes the first time I recommend going for Esplanadian as he is the easiest to get first time through.\n\nThat hiccup aside though this is a solidy written adventure wtih a variety of paths through depending on what companions you get. I recommend trying for the other two after finishing the game once with Esplanadian.","August 15, 2015","true","17.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

There's still the classic Choose Your Own Adventure format with dice-based combat, but the sections are longer, and combined with the minor changes in the text from, e.g,, having a companion or not, you feel like you're interacting with and advancing a narrative, not just going through a dungeon crawl a few pages at a time.\n\nPolished interface with fun dice-rolling physics and -- most importantly -- the option to change the font and text size.\n\nThe main negative is that the frequent combat is largely luck-based, and since there's few opportunities to regain health, a few unlucky dice rolls can make the game basically unwinnable without resorting to cheats. Even just doubling the amount of health restored by resting and using potions would make the game more balanced.\n\nEDIT: The developers seem to have fixed the issue with Steam achievements.","September 3, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Me, I love it. You're a RPG-fan and like stories, and are not silly that you want full VO, then you shall too. Get the first too though and play it, since the story heavily references upon it.\n\nBasically this game looks and plays like a choose your own adventure. There are 3 difficulty levels, casual (unlimited health, back button), adventure (unlimited saves) and classic (what RPG-vets like me run of course). One suggestion during character creation, make sure your fitness is high. Way more important than hitpoints.\n\nGameplaywise you read sections of text and then make choices. Choices that matter. Choices that may reference "if you have item X" where you think 'were could that possibly have dropped?' There are branching paths and several ways to lead to the same destination and if you replay you may even skip certain sections you were sure were plotimportant and unskippable. Pretty much all choices have resolution, and yes, that can mean DEATH. In classic, prepare to replay sections, though that goes much faster not reading sections you repeat.\nAside from these choices, there are events where you need to roll dice based on your fitness (hopefully you have it high), where failing can have dire consequences (including, yes, DEATH).\nAnd then there's combat. Have you played Risk? Since about the same principle goes here. Including screaming when your rolls go bad (often). The highest roll is compared to the defender, the higher wins. Equal? Look at the next etc. If you run out dice that way before the opponent they win. So obviously you want armor and weaponry that adds more dice giving you a higher chance at those 6'es. Also all dice for weapons decide damage. Double so good to improve. Aside from better gear you can get a temp boost with fitness (you did roll a high number for it right?) It can give you +1 to a roll (yes, above 6 meaning autmatic win if that happens). Catch? It gets harder the more you do it in a battle, and if you fail the roll you get -1 to your roll. And if you used it defensively, and the opponent rolls a 6, you're screwed yeah.\n\nAnd that hurts, since HP's are low. Restoring HP is rare and low (unless casual) and enemies can do a lot of damage. All the perfect ingredients for the hardcore RPG-lover to have hours of fun. So what are you waiting for?","September 18, 2015","true","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While I personally didn't click all too well with the narrative this time around, at least with the routes I took, I had an absolutely lovely time with the adventures of myself and my cute thief companion I couldn't find a way to romance. There are tons of charming twists and turns to be had with the story, with areas, items, and experiences you could easily miss; something I wish more modern games took advantage of, but that is for another time.\n\nSince this is mainly a story with choices and some cute old school dice-based fights, is the story any good compared to its predacessor? Yes and no. An Assassin in Orlandes benefits from a much tighter narrative experience, being a shorter story over all but had plenty of optional things and outcomes to make it a charming affair, even though a single playthrough you'd see just about everything.\n\nThe prose, like story, is much longer winded, and that can be a bit off putting, especially with the amount of purple prose  found in this one. It's all well written mind you, but there are instances of ten page sections where you have little control at all. Like the romance I mentioned earlier, I found it often the case in the writing that in moments of actual important choice, I was but a reader with no control, as "you" makes all the big choices for you. This does not occur all the time, but there are plenty of moments in which options weren't pursued. It could've been a tighter budget or something of the nature, but outside of choosing your next location or how to go about a fight, I found the story a bit less engaging than the first. This isn't bad at all mind you, and there is still tons of choices and options, but it was a bit off putting.\n\nThe guys who do these charming little novels clearly put a lot of heart into the writing and development, and the improvements on all their games are clearly their. Even for my critical deconstruction, I still had a blast with this one and will do with many more to come. It may not be my favorite CYOA, but it's hard to not love the variety and creativity they've put into the series. Absolutely worth the purchase if you have the chance.","November 8, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
