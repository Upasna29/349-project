"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/228440/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","I haven't played cubemen since the release of the new updates, so I will be updating this review once I have had the chance to test out the new unit balances.\n\nGameplay:\nIf you're not playing this game to compete with friends, but rather just occasionally compete against the AI then you will probably enjoy this game. It offers interesting new features such a placing mines and building walls, which allow you to control the enemy flow. By using special units you or the enemy can disassemble the walls.  The AI are rather simple and in reality offer no competition even on the hardest difficulty. Although, unlike the first cubemen the interesting feature this one has to offer is that the units can be upgraded. This means you can build armies up with strong weak units rather than more expensive units. The problem is this leads to unbalances. In the original if you lost the first fight you could send your cubemen out and kill the unit that killed yours without too much difficulty now the player can heal the unit by upgrading it and you're stuck in second place for the rest of the game. Because the new unit has upgraded range and damage so winning the second round with your un-upgraded stock unit is not too likely.\n\nCampaign:\nThe campaign is just mission after mission with no story, random levels, and increasing wave numbers. The campaign is rather lacking as the enemy does not possess special units so you can easily control enemy flow by using wall placements. I also found myself only ever using Grill units throughout the campaign and just upgrading them. You will also notice there is no saving throughout the campaign so you may want to reserve about three hours to give yourself enough time to play through it.\n\nThe Price:\nCubemen 2, another installment to the Cubemen series. The game is sort of fun, and if you can get it for under $1.99 then it’s not a bad price either. This game is on the itunes app store for $1.99 so the fact it is here for $7.99 just seems plain ridiculous.\n\nResults:\nAll in all I am going to recommend this game, but only if you can get it for the right price. $7.99 is absurd and honestly I am amazed 3 Sprockets has the audacity to ask for such a high figure with this game. Despite the price 3 Sprockets offers a fun little games; Cubemen 2 has interesting game types which offer new strategies not demanded from the first game and a map editor so you can create your maps that optimize each game type. If you ever played Warcraft III and liked Footman Wars then this is probably the game for you.\n\nPros:\n+Map editor\n+New units (that allow you to control enemy flow)\n+Unit upgrades\n+New game types (that allow for players to not just perfect one strategy)\n+Smoother gameplay\n\nCons:\n-Boring campaign\n-Units can be hard to click sometimes resulting in the unit you were last on running next to the location of the unit you want to select (should have a different select and move key)\n-The health tile heals too rapidly (one player can easily hold the health tile)\n-Sometimes units do not turn by themselves instead they just stop fighting when units walk past their periphery.\n-Does not have the epic menu music like in the original cubemen.","February 23, 2014","true","3.0"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","1"

Some of said changes consist of the ability to upgrade units, adds some new units and removes some older units (Medics for example are no longer featured, but instead you get mines, engineers and walls) just to name a few. Cubemen 2 also brings in many new game modes and options which adds much more variety to the singleplayer and multiplayer skirmishes, thus adding more playability and fun into the game. For these reasons alone, it probably makes Cubemen 2 the superior game out of the two, but personally, I prefer the interface in the first game as it feels less cluttered, but that's about it, in terms of gameplay and options, this one excells greatly.\n\nThere are some other new features in Cubemen 2 such as level and unit skins, while a nice adition I think one of the things that gives Cubemen it's charm is it's simplicity, these skins kind of take that away from the game, but it's a good addition non-the-less as it adds a little bit more variety and be more to the taste of some players.\n\nMy only little problem with Cubemen 2 is the lack of a real singleplayer campaign, there are two scenarios called "defense campaigns" but they're not necessarily as good as they can be and feel more like aditional tutorial levels, it feels like a bit of a wasted oportunity to me. There are a good selection of maps to play single and multiplayer games on, plus a fairly large library of fan-created maps, some of which are really well made and fun to play, so there's still that! If 3Sprockets plan on developing another Cubemen game, I hope they consider a lengthy and in-depth campaign.\n\nAll in all, just like the first game Cubemen 2 is lots of fun in both single and multiplayer, many new options and mechanics brought to the table improve the experience. A great blend of Tower Defense and Real-Time Strategy, I would recommend to just about anybody. This game is practically given away in Steam sales so pick it up if you get a chace!","April 9, 2015","true","51.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Think Team Fortress 2, with smaller maps, always on Comannder from Battlefield, and everybody actually does what you say.\n\nYou have 10 different classes of Cubemen. You have Pistol, Flint, Lightning, Ice, Rocket, Laser, Sniper, Engineer, Wall, and Mine. You move them around the map, and whenever somebody gets inside their shooting range, they shoot.\n\nYou can play online with up to 5 other people, with modes such as Mayhem, CTF, Skirmish, and Territory. You can play with the AI if you want.\n\nIn singleplayer, it's tower defense, but in real time. Each wave starts on its own, which creates a sense of danger. Your opponents charge WILL shoot back at your defenses, so make sure you have a ton of them.\n\nThis game is amazing and I would suggest it to anyone who likes strategy games.","March 16, 2014","true","3.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The types of cubemen range from soldiers with pistols to flamethrowers to rocket launchers to sniper rifles to ones that turn into walls and land mines. To unlock these units during a game, you buy them with cubes which you get for defeating enemies. Each time you buy a new unit, the price for that unit goes up one cube. For example, if you buy a flamethrower cubeman for 20 cubes the price goes up to 21 and so on. There are a few different game modes like defense, skirmish, rescue, and capture the flag. The game also comes with a level editor so you can make new levels and upload them so other people can play and rate them. Because of this, you may be finding yourself finding lots of interesting levels that you can play other than the ones that come with the game. This game also has an awesome techno soundtrack.\n\nI recommend this game, but I think $8 is a little too much for this game. If this game interests you, I would suggest waiting for it to go on sale. I wouldn't say you'd play this for hours straight, but it's a good game to get if you're looking for something new and interesting to keep you occupied for a few minutes.","February 22, 2014","true","13.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yet, in this miserable ocean, a lone seafarer of incomparable greatness, treads along these hopeless economic waters, with the row of 3d firs person shooter's retribution, and paddle-boat of introspective creation. This sailor lays waste to all sweaty ogres and gross trolls in the way!!! Sea Snakes (EA games), Monsters (FunCom), very poisonous sea anenomes (BigHouse Games), and the sea serpent of them all (Minecraft ripoffs), have attempted to destroy our noble warrior but the spirit of promising individual economic pursuit and unfiltered, dynamic, organic game generation.\n\nStanding miles away from the steed's overwhelmingly luminscent vessel, stands yourself.

Suddenly, the largest tsunami you could even see comes crashing into your frail teenage body, densely compressed water projectiles penetrating your life-source™. You are drowning. Big time.

You feel lifted from the obligations of rushed-out, hollywood mega graphix, game games. Cubemen 2's incentivizing achievements, complicated gamemodes rivaling league of legends and mobas combined, awesome skin customization, and general reliability as a serious gaming situation, ramps up the intensity that the original title obtained awareness for.\n\nI'm surely not one to romanticize my thoughts on sequels, but for the first time ever, I'd really love to take this one out on an e-date.\n\nCubemen 2, 2000 hours won't even fill your void for this game.

I almost started to feel a sleep. This game did NOT GAME ANY challange at start. Well ok , newbies  are newbies , maybe some slopokes can have troubles but really u must be a terriable slopoke to have any troubles there, game starting to get BORING AT START.\nI dicided to make a "skirmish game" and made a endless with pro mode. You wont beliave but i did fell a sleep after 99+ wave - i didnt feel any challange , any options in game, that was deadly boring.\n\nAll "-" of the game:\n-It have JUST 6 "towers" (sisnce this game is tower defence , so we call them a towers, u can call them a soldiers ofcourse , as u wish) BUT WTF just 6 towers and u cant advance them at all!!!!! All u can just lvl them up with damn 3 lvls.\nIt is too easy.\nNo challange , looks like u playing with cheats and  dont have even any chances to lose.\n(ok i lost once at first game , i didnt really understood at start WTF u should do with this game and just rolled around a camera)\nOMFG u can lvl up just 3 lvls up. This is really terriable. Even  falsh games can give u a full deep advancing of towers in 12-15 diffirenbt levels with unique skills and properties, and u dont need to pay money for that. OMFG here it is just 3 damn lvls. And u have to pay money for this.\n\nThe conclusion.\n\nGameplay - 2/5 - deadly boring.\nDifficulty - 1/5 - feel a sleep.\nGraffics - 1/5 - good cube idea but there is no any graffics anyway.\nAdvance - 1/5 - God damn 3 lvls up is all u can do in game- no comments.\nStory - 1/5 - does it have any story? maybe i skipped it ?\nIdea -4/5 - well i did like the main idea of giving a new version of Tower defence style. I give a good 4 for that.\n\n\nSo i dont really know what to rate in this game, all it was is IDEA. cube ppl attack cube ppl. Idea is good.

You can play and win many games using nothing but the base Grill troop, but on harder settings the tactics really come into their own.\n\nTheres nothing quite like buinding your own castle then lining the parapets with snipers to deny access to your wouldbe attackers.\n\nThe myriad game modes keep gameplay fresh, I've barely touched the official content. The community designed levels (and my own) will keep me going for my money's worth twenty times over.\n\nBuying this on iOS for cross-compatibility is a fantastic incentive.\nI love building a level on my laptop and playing it on my phone while waiting for friends in town.\nI personally love the co-op experience, but Cubemen 2 has it all.\n\n(At time of writing, this game is included in the featured Humble Bundle and an absolute steal!)\n\nA must have.","October 5, 2014","true","35.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is voxel based game (meaning the game is based on cubes hence the name CUBEmen 2). How ever when you are building a map the area is small as well as you have to have 6 bases in the map even if your only going to play by yourself with only 3 other A.I., cpu, BOT, Ect. The gameplay is amazing and you can move units around after placement and you can upgrade each unit as well, when the unit is upgraded its life is fully restored (units do not regenerate health). On the map there may be health stations were you can move your units to heal them. You also may encounter teleporters on the map that will teleport your units to the coresponding teleporter.","May 9, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now it has bunch of options for the missions and few different types of missions. You can customize the looks of the cubemen and the levels a bit, but in the end, it's all about killing the enemies. Compared to the first installment, it sure is a lot more fun! Some units are gone, but some other units have appeared. Now you have walls and mines even! Oh and did I say you can now upgrade units?
