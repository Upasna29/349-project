"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/recommended/337930/","chudah","Chudah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/","1693 products in account","Nameless ~the one thing you must recall~ is the second game by indie developer Cheritz, widely known for their very popular otome dating sim, Dandelion ~wishes brought to you~.  Unlike Dandelion, however, Nameless is a straight visual novel with very little game play outside of making decisions at key points in the story.  There is a LOT of reading, so anyone expecting a similar experience to Dandelion may want to do a little more research before purchasing.  For those who enjoy well crafted visual novels, this is just the title for you.\n\nOur story begins with the protagonist, 16 year-old Eri, living alone since her grandfather passed away nearly a year ago.  Her parents have worked abroad her entire life, and even now at this critical time of loss, they leave her to manage alone save for the benevolent, although slightly oblivious, school principal who keeps casual watch over her as he resides in the same building.  But life goes on... until Eri wakes one morning to find her treasured ball-joint dolls, the only beings who have kept her company these many lonely months, have magically come to life.  Now she must figure out how to work her new "family" into her daily life without drawing suspicion from those who know her best.\n\nAt its heart, Nameless is a tale of loss and abandonment, but it's also one of hope and renewal. And despite it's very romantic narrative, the underlying themes elevate it to something more than your standard "feel-filled" dating sim. The premise may seem a bit odd, but it works, albeit slowly.  The novel's greatest strength is in how every thread ties together the fabric of the overall story, but in a sense it is also its greatest weakness.  It is only through reading and experiencing everything the novel has to offer, including the multitude of bad endings, that one can fully grasp the scope of the story and realize just how closely every event is intertwined and how damaged each character truly is.  And it's only by reading the final hidden chapters that it's revealed how deeply our protagonist is scarred by the neglect she's dealt with her entire life.  These revelations breathe new life and meaning into the characters and will have you examining the story long after you've closed it for the final time. Unfortunately, some may lose interest well before those threads begin coming together, especially considering how slow the reveals prove to be.\n\nDespite the absurdity of the situation, by outward appearances this is a slice of life tale.  As such, the narrative pace is slow but nuanced with details that build upon another painting a portrait of Eri and the world she lives in which is explored through each additional story route. It takes well over half of the game to see the inklings of an overarching narrative, however, but patience is handsomely rewarded.  Your second and third readings of the common route will reveal new dialogues with characters whose routes you've previously finished, further developing their personalities now that we understand them a bit better.  And once you unlock the final two characters, things get quite a bit more interesting when darker undertones surface as you piece together just what has been going on all along.  I found it incredibly intriguing how precarious the entire situation is, with tragedy often arising from the most innocent of decisions. Make no mistake these darker aspects of the story will hook you like nothing else.\n\nNameless is indeed much darker than it first appears.  Themes of abuse, obsession and abandonment play prominently throughout the character routes and are most apparent in the numerous bad endings.  Some scenes made me incredibly uncomfortable while others had me close to tears.  There's also quite a bit of sexual innuendo and suggestive language as well as some mature situations.  Although nothing explicit takes place on screen, I feel at times the narrative may be inappropriate for younger readers.\n\nFor the romantics, there is no shortage of romance here.  The story will play at your heart, twist it into knots, break it in two, and when the final confession of feelings plays out, race faster than it ever has as you wait with bated breath for that first lovely kiss between Eri and her chosen beau.  By the time the credits roll, you'll have fallen in love with each of the boys along with her, even the ones you couldn't stand from the start.\n\nThe presentation is phenomenal with artwork that is both detailed and emotive.  Each character is creatively designed and drawn over beautiful backgrounds.  Gorgeous CG's highlight important story points while  the pastel palette paints a soft picture of youth and innocence with sepia undertones lending a nostalgic lens to the scenery.  Delicately crafted acoustic music selections complement the imagery with romantic, yet somber, melodies.  Most themes have multiple versions that intensify at key moments enhancing the emotional resonance of the story to great effect.\n\nAs one who normally turns voices off in these types of games, I found myself spellbound by the incredible performances.  After turning them briefly on to get a feel for the quality, I couldn't bring myself to shut them off again.  The actors do an incredible job of bringing each character to life with top notch performances that fit their personalities perfectly.  Every piece of dialogue is Korean voiced including all minor characters, something that is altogether uncommon for non-Japanese visual novels.\n\nIf I had to complain about one thing it would be the typos and awkward phrasings that are sprinkled throughout.  Most are rather minor and do not disrupt the narrative flow much, if at all, but they can be a bit jarring when they pop up during important emotional scenes, briefly pulling you out of the experience.  Odd phrasings (most likely due to sticking to the original Korean meanings a little too closely) can take a bit of getting used to as well, but everything is coherent and understandable, even if in a slightly roundabout way.\n\nAnd now the nitty gritty, the price.  $33 is a hefty sum for any game, and considering Cheritz has never been known to offer a discount on their titles, you're unlikely to pick up it up for less than that.  So then, is it truly worth it?  In my opinion, having played at least a good 10-15 visual novels on Steam, and pretty much all of the otome available here (and elsewhere), you're not going to find better value for your dollar when it comes to the genre, at least not unless we start getting official Japanese localizations.  Fast readers generally log around 30 hours to completion while slower ones may take upwards of 50, assuming they're letting the voice actors play out their dialogue. Given the high quality of every aspect from the artwork to the voice acting and music, Cheritz probably could have asked for more and I would maintain it's still worth the price.  There are some who feel that no matter how high the quality, visual novels should never ask as much due to the nature of the genre itself.  In that case, perhaps this game isn't for you. But for anyone else, do yourself a favor, save up that $30 and buy this gem.  Every penny is worth it as long as you allow Nameless the time it needs to win you over.\n\nBottom Line: Highly recommended for both otoge and visal novel fans as well as anyone who enjoys a complex and well-written narrative.","February 4, 2015","true","59.2"," 215 of 222 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","215","222","5","13"

It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.” ― Jane Austen, Pride And Prejudice\n\nThis "review" that I will be trying to write shall be a genuine blabber gathered from my jumbled up thoughts and still strained heart, as this astonishing visual novel left me stranded and stole all and any coherent words that I may use in an alternative situation. For a girl who grew up as a wise loner with working parents and only a kindly grandmother to attend to her, Nameless was a game too close to home for me.\n\nOur protagonist is a young girl named Eri - It's MC's default name, but you can give her any name that you wish. As our story opens its curtains for the first time, we learn that she's been living with her grandfather for a long while since her parents have been working abroad constantly. She isn't extraordinary, or even bright; but she is very kind and patient as any generic sob story anime heroine - remember Clannad? Seeing her parents once or twice in a year, Eri grew up as a lonesome child and picked up an odd hobby of collecting ball jointed dolls to relieve her from the burden of the deafening silence in her home after the passing of her grandpa. Her silent, routine and unremarkable little life was the same each and every day. She wakes up, goes to school, cleans and washes, talks to her dolls and bring the end of another day... until one morning she wakes up to find all her dolls magically turned into young boys! With this absurd event, the surreal becomes the new real for Eri as she tries to adapt to a new life of living with her new family.\n\nNameless is a visual novel at its core: an incredibly well-written psychoanalytical + mystical sob story with fable-ish character and environment design. Yes it is also a dating simulation, but you really shouldn't expect common cheesiness of a casual otome. The game carries a definite undertone with themes such as abandonment, innocence, self-image, memory, the otherness and personal growth. None of these themes are taken light heartedly. If you are to pick this one, you really should be warned:\n\n1. You are in for a possibly heart and mind wrecking experience if you complete the game.\n2. It is required for you to complete game more than once to accomplish different character paths, and all stories come together to paint the grand picture little by little.\n3. There is a TRUCKLOAD of reading for a really slow pacing story and some well put choice options in dialogue or action now and then. So be ready to read big time.\n\nAs a personal note: I am genuinely speechless. The narration, the storyline, the atmosphere, thematic choices, the soundtrack, the character design, the in-depth character analysis and progression + background are the best that I've ever seen in this genre. As if the actual game wasn't overwhelming enough - with at least 4 different endings for each character - we are given the option of collecting diaries of different characters in game to have some insight on their personal train of thoughts. I've just completed the game and noticed that I have 61 hours of playtime. Sixty - ♥♥♥♥ing - one! And this is me using skip option for some dialogue that I've already seen in different game progressions. This was my first VN from Cheritz. Thank you Cheritz. You are an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You ripped me a new tear duct.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","December 12, 2015","true","60.3"," 91 of 99 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","91","99","2","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/marigold/recommended/337930/","marigold","Demoiselle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/marigold/","128 products in account","WARNING: If you suffer from an intense fear of dolls, Nameless will justify every single one of your fears and manage to create many, many more.\n\nHow to review a game without a name? A game in which you read extensively rather than running around smacking things with a giant sword or building stuff out of blocks that definitely aren’t arranged in a way to suggest inappropriate aspects of human anatomy? By saying IT’S TOTALLY AWESOME, that’s how. You’d think I’d have far more sophisticated vocabulary after so many hours of visual novels, but no.\n\nYes, Nameless (if that is, in fact, its real name) is a visual novel, and unlike its predecessor, Dandelion, there’s absolutely no stat-raising at all. Some people weren’t fond of the excessive, sometimes tedious stat-raising in that game, but here there aren’t any stats to raise, part-time jobs to do, or gifts/power-ups to buy. That may be a plus (if you’re like me) or a minus if you enjoy some sort of “real” gameplay in your visual novels (and/or are a masochist—kidding!). Still, I’d wholeheartedly recommend playing Dandelion before Nameless if you can afford both, not just because it’s also awesome but because there are some lovely references sprinkled throughout Nameless—but they each can be enjoyed completely separately. There's a certain character you'll appreciate a LOT more if you've played Dandelion first, however.\n\nYou might have noticed the distinct lack of giant…bosoms featured in the art on the store page for this game. Yes, those are all guys, even if some of them are exceptionally pretty. No, this is NOT boy’s love/yaoi/dudesquared or whatever the proper term is. You play a lonely, secretly grieving high school girl, Eri (or whatever you choose to name her), who takes solace in her collection of ball-jointed dolls. (Google "Crobidolls" if you want to gaze upon their beautifully creepy splendor.) Thankfully, Eri's not your typical crybaby doormat “n-no it’s embarrassing” otome protagonist. Her “seriously unimpressed face” (you’ll know it when you see it—and you will see it often) alone has endeared her to me forever. Though, like many otome game protagonists, she does seem to have issues identifying basic human emotions and physical responses sometimes. Yes, why does one's heart beat faster when an especially hot guy is nearby?\n\nThose pretty boys in the pictures--Eri's ball-jointed dolls who ~somehow~ turn into hot human guys and end up living in a house with her (potential band name: Dolls II Men)--are her romantic interests, and they all have interesting and varied personalities. The doll-guys aren't your usual one-note, wish-fulfilling otome game love interests, either, with some of them having serious psychological trauma that needs to be worked through in their specific routes--but they can all be extremely entertaining and heartwarming too. If you’re familiar with Dandelion, you may already be prepared for them to make you laugh, cry, and possibly curl up under your desk until the pain goes away.\n\nWhat’s a visual novel without choices? Probably something along the lines of a moving picture book. Luckily, that’s not the case in Nameless. To replace the stat-raising, dates, and stuff-buying of Dandelion, Nameless offers a lot of choices for the player to make. Sometimes it’s not entirely clear which choice leads to which outcome, which is exacerbated by the absence of some sort of “love meter” common in similar games—like Dandelion. I’d recommend Googling something along the lines of “nameless [doll dude’s name] walkthrough” if you want to make sure you’re on the right track the first time around.\n\nEach character has a “happy” ending (relatively—the developer, Cheritz, is deliciously evil, as you will soon discover) as well as MULTIPLE bad endings. Yes. Multiple. Bad. Endings. ENJOY. They’re still worth seeing, however—the story and universe are fascinating and elaborate and it’s worth digging deeper, even if you have to spend a few hours crying under your desk afterward. If you encountered Jisoo's "bad end" in Dandelion...you ain't seen nothin' yet.\n\nOthers have mentioned the top-notch voice acting (in Korean), the gorgeous art and CGs, the lovely music, and the fleshed-out supporting cast of characters. One of my main criticisms of Dandelion (and various other otome games) was that once you choose your guy and start down his path (which doesn’t begin until after you finish the prologue and a small number of “common route” chapters in Nameless for the first three available routes), everyone else sort of fades into the background or disappears entirely. It’s just you and your man. Okay, looking at these men, that may be nice, but still. It's definitely not a problem in Nameless at all, since the story will keep the other guys and supporting cast around. Other people live in this world too, and they’re worth getting to know!\n\nOne last thing: please go easy on the super-enthusiastic reviews from people with very little playtime—as mentioned elsewhere, Nameless originally came out in November 2013 on Cheritz’s website, and is one of the VERY, VERY few (excuse me while I wipe away a tear) otome games made outside of English-speaking countries to have an English translation provided right off the bat. It was released on Steam on Christmas Eve, 2014. (A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE!) Otome fans tend to be very eager to support future possible releases (like the next game Cheritz is working on...!) and are often overflowing with enthusiasm for their favorite games and game characters.","December 25, 2014","true","55.4"," 79 of 88 people (90%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","90","79","88","16","9"

Dandelion will forever be in my heart, but Nameless was an incredibly fun & thoughtful journey.\n\nUnlike Dandelion, Nameless doesn't rely on interactive simulation stat-raising and instead is a traditional visual novel where the choices you make determine which ending you get. The prologue is long, don't worry over not getting to the OP right away. Most scenes appear in Eri's school, house, and the café Tei works at. The recommended playing order is Lance>Yeonho>Yuri>Tei>Red. Routes average 3-6 hours each.\n\nStory/Characters  (THE MEAT. THE TURKEY. THE LETTUCE TO YOUR SALAD)\nWhat’d happen if your dolls suddenly became human & lived with you in everyday life? I’m pretty sure they've done this already (coughLife-Sizecough) but now as a dating sim by Cheritz bounds are, things are going to be…interesting. Each of the dolls can, for the most part, function normally due to their doll concepts (interesting thing, as someone who is picky about typical tropes/illogics I found that any appearing worked well for the game because the guys were actually limited dolls with unconditional love). However, two have come from previous owners & ALL of them, being dolls-recently-become-human, are VERY MENTALLY FRAGILE/INSECURE. Every guy was fleshed out enough to be understandable and loveable. They all developed very nicely & EACH surprised me despite first impressions. I loved how character “opposites” ended up complementing each other in each other’s routes.\nThe routes are also tied to a deeper plot. It made playing them have meaning, which overall is a very smart thing, making the game end feel more complete & satisfying (well, it’s Cheritz, so...semi-satisfying & partly angry).\n\nIronically enough, in comparison, the actual human characters end up not being as human. The bonus diaries help, but I would’ve liked a little bit more meat (heh) with some of the side characters, ex. Shinbi. The ones worse off hands down, however, is Eri’s –incredibly shallow- schoolmates-cough-sheep. Oh my gosh. I get why they appear like this, but WHY. WHY DO THEY HAVE TO BE SO SUPERFICIAL\nAnother of the issues I have is with some of the bad endings. A few, though creepy, were unclear/unbelievable on how they might’ve unfolded. They also kinda overdid it with one of the characters & led me into believing that he knew more than he did, & it was really unclear what he was trying to do with some of the things he did in his route. The last problem is more of a nitpick, but is just questioning why the MC is many times described as “plain” when she’s friends with the 2 most beautiful girls in school. I know it’s a thing regularly used but…gah.\n\nAlthough the cast is younger, the script is more...perverted...heh...\n\nGameplayPress CTRL to skip unread text, right-click to access menu. It'd be nice to have a little picture of a keyboard & mouse on the options screen showing keys you can press to do things. Would’ve LOVED to be able to go through text by pressing arrow buttons instead of clicking only. Changing the screen to the minimized “window” version also made it difficult to access the quick save/load buttons at the bottom of the screen.\n\nA few minor spelling errors (the diary has a bit, also at some instances they mention a girl speaking when a male voice is used & I still can’t get over the phrase “He is my fist doll”), but these appear significantly less often than Dandelion’s. Yay for improvement! :D\nA few other things:\n- Texts on Eri’s phone that pop out on-screen during scenes have to be clicked again after in order to be recognized as being read.\n- After some Bad End titles appear, & midway through the transition to the title screen, the bad end’s music plays again for a couple seconds.\n- Some awkward white transitions\nEDIT: Major issues have been fixed and I've removed them. Still some small spelling errors but not so many that the ones left are more of a nitpick. THANK YOU FOR RESPONDING QUICKLY <3\n\nExtra features included Eri's texts and diary being readable in-game, and in the Special section being able to read other character diaries as well, which was great and added some more depth. Unfortunately there was no translation for the audio clips in the Bonus section, so I didn't look into this that much.\n\nThe gameplay expects you to start a new game completely after finishing one route in order to grab a few more tidbits. The problem with this setup, though, is that most people are tempted to just start over at a common route save file instead, because going through the entire thing again with not much new content is really t e d i o u s\n\nVisualsABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, this is what many people are raving about. Lovely cell-shaded character designs, & soft hues of purples, reds, & greys. The character animation is done very well – I notice a lot more movement while characters talk to one another & it’s not sudden or awkward at all. A good variety of facial expressions & they blink, too!\nThe rain & snow animation is excellent, maybe a little too good, because the feather animation looks a little too cartoon-y in comparison. Backgrounds are nicely detailed. CGs are well-drawn. Personally I didn’t like the MC’s non-uniform outfits, but that is my own preference. Other people might find them very nice.\nOpening & ending videos, for some reason, didn’t appear as high-def as the rest of the game. They were nice but a little grainy.\n(also, there are VERY SUBTLE references to Dandelion, both in background, plot, & even once in casual script…”an orange, an apple, &…cat.”)\n\nSoundSoundtrack\nI am someone who is a huge fan of game OSTS. This one did not disappoint, it's wonderful. Being someone who’s listened to quite a few drama/video game/anime OSTs, however, I was hard-pressed to find one that really stood out to me. Regardless I am still heavily considering buying the soundtrack.\nIn contrast to the mellow OST, the opening & ending songs are pop-py & upbeat. Like Dandelion's, the lyrics relate, something that I always look for. There are 3 regular end songs shared among the dolls, & all the songs are sung by the dolls’ voice actors which was A REALLY NEAT IDEA.\nNOTE: The opening song is sung by Red’s & Tei’s voice actors. They also sing their shared ending song. Same goes for Yeonho & Lance, & Yuri's is with him &...the creepy doctor Yujin both…\n\nVoice Acting\nI became highly invested in Dandelion & its characters in large part due to its EXCELLENT voice acting, Nameless proves superb as well. It is very WELL. DONE. DO NOT TURN OFF THE VOICE ACTING. THIS IS THE THING THAT MAKES YOUR PURCHASE WORTH. SO WORTH. (I think one evilly laughing voice actor had way too much fun)\nI also liked how the MC’s name appears in the script, & therefore –seemingly- appears in the voice acting, although it’s not actually mentioned.\nThe one problem I have with the voice acting, however, is that the MC has none. It also made it difficult sometimes to discern whether she was talking in her head or out loud. I guess this is to get players to “become” the MC themselves, but emotional voice acting on their part actually helps me identify with them more because then I can get how they feel in a situation. They feel more humane & realistic this way.\n\nDue to a cut review I am pointing out issues/opinions more, but aside from these, this game is great. I cried a bit.\nPlay it.\nEnjoy the ride.","December 30, 2014","true","36.8"," 86 of 103 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","86","103","0","3"

(Whilst her parents are working thousands of miles away, "researching." ) Hooray!\n\nYour story choices affect the route you go on, though some routes are locked until certain requirements are met. The recommended order is Lance>Yeonho>Yuri>Tei>Red. ~Yeonho and Yuri have some bad ends that show a plot point rather early on, which may lessen the impact of later scenes for the reader.

They're jealous of anybody getting too close to them and mob them every day.

Them, along with the Banjul workers and Yujin, give the game world a more lively feel. Aaand they're important!\n\nThe game's backgrounds aren't super special, but the character sprites are beautiful. The coloring and art style give a nice "fairy tale" feel that is easy on the eyes.

The morning theme tells of shiny, refreshing new days. The song that plays in the bad ends is like a voice shouting in your head, "You ♥♥♥♥ed up dude!" Soi's theme is adorable, and Red's theme makes mundane ♥♥♥♥ like running to a bus stop awesome. I can't think of a track that I dislike!\n\nI'd put this game somewhere in my top 5 favorite Steam games. So unless you dislike some shoujo cliches or romance, you should check this out.

Ever since she was little, her grandfather has been taking care of her because her parents are too busy with research and are often out of the country. Eri's grandfather does his best to raise her but eventually, he passes away (about a year before the game starts). To combat her loneliness, Eri starts to collect ball-jointed-dolls of different types, talking to them as if they're really alive. It helps her deal with the sad reality that she's lost her beloved grandfather and that her parents rarely have time for her. But then one day... Eri wakes up to five strange, bickering boys in her living room -- her dolls have suddenly come alive!\n\nNameless deals with heavy themes, from abandonment and loneliness to obsession and identity. Eri herself struggles with her lonely life, but her five now-human-dolls also struggle with their own existence -- some have to deal with issues left by their previous owners, others are unsure about their own self-worth and identity. Through each doll's romance path, Eri helps her dolls deal with these issues. There are also a few bad endings that are definitely 100% creepy, occasionally violent, and very dark.\n\nPros+ A tremendous amount of character development for both Eri and the five guys\n+ A deep & profound psychological background for all characters\n+ Fully voiced with high quality voice acting\n+ Gorgeous art and CG\n+ A mysterious, dark overarching storyline\n+ The "game" is aware of how far you have progressed and changes accordingly\n+ Nice soundtrack with custom songs for every doll/guy\n+ Lots of save slots and a skip option (though you won't need it often)\n+ Two close female friends who play a role in every part of the game & are very supportive of Eri!\n\nCons- A few grammar mistakes & typos, but not many\n- In order to finish the game, you will have to play through ALL the romance routes\n- Some of the CG pieces are a tiny bit awkward proportion-wise (especially Tei's)\n- More of an actual visual novel; lots & lots of reading with not too many choices\n- Some of the bad endings might be too disturbing for some (though nothing is explicitly shown)\n\nThis is just a really, REALLY good game. I'm all about character development and psychological backgrounds that actually make sense, and this game gave me all that. I had a lot of feelings. I cried a little. I would recommend this 110% if you like visual novels and if the themes of this game appeal to you. It's better than any visual novel + otome game I've played so far.","February 1","true","16.8"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","23","23","0","0"

A really close friend of mine purchased it for me on a whim that I might like it since I recently came to loving visual novels and always loved games where you get to choose a route with different endings. This game is absolutely amazing. Yes, Yes It IS pretty steep compared to other visual novels. But I can say after playing this  non stop since I got it is that I can safely say It's worth it. Honestly.\n\n~It has alot of replay value.\n~The music is Suberb.\n~Voice Acting is Perfect.\n~The art....My god the art. Simply love the art style.\n\nSure it has some flaws. Every game comes with flaws. Whether small or big. Regardless of that tho someone is always going to complain. You can't always please everyone. I've read that the subtitles have alot of errors from other reviews. But they didn't bother me. I didn't notice any errors too major. The story had me intrigued from the moment I began reading. Unlike a couple other visual novels where i lose interest very quickly no matter how hard I try to wait it out. (I get distracted and lose interest very easily sometimes.) This game touches on themes of loneliness, abandonment, self worth, self hate, and acceptance. These topics resonate, and they create an experience that is sure to stay with the player long after the game is finished. Just click, read, and enjoy. No stat building here.","January 13, 2015","true","51.0"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","31","38","2","4"

If you've played Dandelion these characters are definitely darker. However they're not just like that as flavor. Their problems and pasts, and the way it's affect them, flow very well with each of the characters. They're all very distinct.\n- The MC's friends actually matter. Her friends Soi and Shinbi actually have their own personalities and matter throughout the course of each route. They plays active roles in helping the MC out, as well as receiving help.\n- Compelling story that gets progressively darker the further you get.\n- The Art. The character designs, sprites, were all lovely. The backgrounds were nice, but in general I don't pay too much attention to the background art. (Unless it's Cinders, so pretty. *_*).\n- I'm in the camp of those that enjoyed the audio, especially the music when things were going wrong. XD\n\nCons:\n- Typos/Grammar Issues. Honestly my brain tends to auto-correct things to the point I don't always notice small grammar issues or typos when I'm not reading to edit and I'm incapable of editing whatever I'm reading, but I did spot some. I never felt like it ruined the game for me though. I've spotted typos in published books. It happens. It sounds like others have had bigger issues with this in the game than I did, but given the enjoyment I got out of this VN it feels like nitpicking.\n- Some of the CGs were admittedly pretty awkward, especially those belonging to Tei.\n\nThe Price:\nI understand a lot of people look at the price and wonder WTF? This is one of the higher quality games on the market with 20-40+ hours of gameplay depending on your reading speed. I played this when Cheritz first released the game. I don't know how many hours beating it the first time took, but second gameplays are always faster and it still took me 33.3 hours to complete.\nThat's not just it though. This game is fully voiced, has many CGs, audio, and has been translated. For its cost you get a lot out of it. Games like this run $60+ in Japan. In America, high quality VNs tend to be around this cost. Hakuoki: Memories of the Shinsengumi, Backstage Pass, Phoenix Wright.\n\nBut it doesn't have trading cards or achievements!!\nDoes that matter? You have a CG gallery, memory gallery, and diary entries all sitting there to collect. Good achievements are one you get for hitting points in the story (Dragon Age: Origins does this) or actual gameplay achievements (like for less story oriented games). Collecting all the CGs, memories, and diary entries are achievements. Yeah they're nice to have, but if the lack of them stops you from buying any game (unless you have already played the game) then you probably weren't very interested in the game to begin with. Having them or not having them has zero impact on the game itself, and to treat the game like it's worse because it doesn't have them doesn't make sense.\n\nFinally, I want to address Voxit's review since it's one of the first reviews you'll come across.\n\n** Spoilers Beyond This Point **\n\nVoxit had a huge issue with the story. Yes, if you're attentive and enjoy figuring endings out before they happen you'll be able to do so. Does that make it any less touching? It did for him. It didn't for me. Unlike him I don't believe the necessarly game runs on trying to surprise you, leaving you unimpressed if it doesn't. If it did it doesn't make sense for the game to be litered with hints about what's going on. The story tries to warn the player. Honestly progressively understanding what's going on makes it as a whole creepier for me because I'm aware of how messed up the situation is. So there's another side to consider.\n\nAnd then there's Voxit's main complaint. I finished the game twice and I never found Red to be the 'true pairing'. He states this but at no point in the English translation does it support this. (I don't know Korean, and thus haven't played the original.) This is assumed. Due to the personality of the characters and the situation, Red has to come last, but just because he's the game's last route doesn't mean she necessarily ended up with him.\n\nThe ending is open ended. Therefore if you like open endings, it's great. If you don't you're going to have more of a problem with it.\n\nFrom what I got out of the game, I think the 'true ending' is actually when you meet the secret character. What does this mean for her romantic life for those who read spoilers or already played the game? Open ended. Yes all the dolls end up in the same dimension and in love with the Heroine, but she never ultimately chooses one. Therefore the other endings do matter. It never denies the existence of any of the relationship, it awknowledges them all. At the end of the game she regains the memories of all the timelines, therefore she'd most likely be in love with all of them.\n\nMaybe she started a harem and dated them all. Maybe she ultimately did decide on one, or two! Maybe she dated the secret character instead!\n\nDo I think the dolls would have fought for her? Of course. The dolls always fight with each other regardless, but do I really think that it's that much of an issue? Nope. We see endings where dolls share her between them even in their most messed up states. At multiple times do they back down to let another doll pursue her, or even help the doll to this end! To a point they respect the others, even in their fighting, and ultimately they want the MC to be happy. It's even stated at the end by Tei that it required all of them to fill her heart, and they all understand and agree with this. So no, I don't think, whichever ending you decide to go with, that it would have been a problem.\n\nI think it's of use to point out that the dolls are just that: dolls. Her dolls. It's shown that dolls pretty much love their owners unconditionally to the point of madness. Even when they become human they're still connected to their doll bodies, shown by the fact that if something happens to the dolls the same thing happens to their human bodies.\n\nAs for how the Wizard continued to make new dimensions I have no idea. Lawl. That's a flaw I'll tip my hat to Voxit.\n\n** End of Spoilers **\n\nI'll leave off with my impression of the game. Maybe the game is actually more about how the relationships between characters can change people for the better and help all invovled heal. It's about obsession and scars, how they fester, and how they hurt. It's about growing up and how people change in theat process. It about the fight between the private and public self. And it's about real friendships and the unconditional support they bring.","January 13, 2015","true","43.6"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Voxit/recommended/337930/","Voxit","Voxit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Voxit/","74 products in account","Nameless was a game I was looking forward to since Cheritz announced it. I was a fan of Dandelion and I thought, "Oh man, this game is going to be so great!!" Sadly, I was left with disappointment. I know there are many people who will disagree with me, but hey, I disagree with their opinions, so whatever.\n\nThere are SPOILERS below so if you have not played the game, you may not understand why I cannot recommend this game.\nI will not cut this game slack just because it is one of the few translated visual novels or because it's one of the better ones. I will judge this game as I would any other professionally made game.\n\nIf you are reading this, this probably means you have already played the game and so it's not necessary to explain it.\n\nOne of the big issues with this game that I've had is probably the the typos and translations (I am Korean so I can understand what they're saying). The typos are abundant and sadly there are quite a few typos even in very serious moments which ruins the immersion of the game. I understand if there were a couple of typos here and there, but this game is just filled to the rim with them and for a game that's supposed to be professionally done and so painstakingly advertised, I would have expected better. The translations aren't terrible, it's just some lines are awkwardly translated into English. Almost as if they were put into google translate, and were translated literally from Korean to English.\n\nAnother problem I had was the art. The sprites were great but many of the CGs were honestly pretty lackluster. The characters faces would look distorted or strange, as well as their proportions. The background art was also pretty mediocre at times, it may not be too noticeable but if you give it a second glance, you can see how awkward it was. But I guess most people don't really care about that, unfortunately I still do.\n\nNow the biggest issue I had with the game is definitely the story. They tried to imitate what they did in Dandelion by having a surprise character like the Wizard, except in the game, he was always there giving us knowledge of his plans and when everything was revealed, we were expected to be surprised. If we weren't expected to be surprised, then probably unimpressed. The ending isn't as touching when you know exactly what is going to happen. I guess the true surprise plot twist was the ending where the Heroine always disappears at the end of every route except for Red.... This is where I got mad. The ending, I'm sorry, was nonsense. The game completely disregarded the fact that it's an otome game by telling you that the other endings you got with the characters literally do not matter. It made all the characters seem like side characters and all the routes you played were irrelevant.\n\nThe true pairing is supposed to be Red and all the guys from the different "dimensions" appear in the same world and let's not forget, they believe they are in love with our Heroine and she loves them, too. Wouldn't that create conflict and mass confusion between the characters? Apparently not because the game just ends! Did anyone think this through? WHY DID ANYONE THINK THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA!?\n\nSimilar things happened in Dandelion but the thing with Dandelion is that they don't deny that the characters got together. Each ending belongs in a different dimension so it did happen, it still exists somewhere. However, in Nameless, that's impossible because the Heroine and all the characters are transported into one world and therefore denies the existence of their relationship.\n\nSo yeah, every route played beforehand didn't really matter. Red is the only one that matters. Don't get me wrong, I still like Red, but it's still disappointing to find out that everything was meaningless.\n\nAlso, how the ♥♥♥♥ did the Wizard continue to make new dimensions when in Dandelion he said it took a ♥♥♥♥ ton of effort and I doubt that one doll or one person had enough memories to restart everything five times......... >_> But I'm just nitpicking....\n\n(I don't have many hours on Steam because I got it before it was on Steam)\nSo is it worth $32.99? No, not until you fix all the typos, coding error with the names, and PLEASE FIX YOUR AUTO TEXT!","January 7, 2015","false","0.5"," 104 of 167 people (62%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","62","104","167","7","11"

It leaves an air of mystery during your first few routes so it will urge you to finish it till the end.\n[In Dandelion, you kind of figure out the whole game once you play a route. The thing you're trying to uncover in the next few routes is the backstory of each animal. Nonetheless, I liked that too.]\n+The background music was fitting so it did a good job of getting me immersed into this game.\n+Many bad endings were so disturbing, it made me want to unlock it all.\n+ Thank god for the "All Skip" option.

I know they have to draw from varying angles, but I mean that it should still look like them. Sometimes they don't :( This especially goes for some of Yuri, Tei, and Red's CGs :( Yuri is supposed to have a longer face to make him look more mature than the others, but he looks so baby-faced in some of them :)) In Dandelion the CG quality was pretty consistent for everyone, so idk what happened here :))\n+The update that deleted everything and caused me to play all the routes twice (now you know why it took me 79 hours to complete this game)\n+The ending felt too abrupt when I started playing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flaiche/recommended/337930/","Flaiche","Flaiche","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flaiche/","26 products in account","My older brother offered me a Christmas gift of my choice this year. A few months earlier, I had just purchased Dandelion and had the most pleasant experience playing a dating sim game in a long time. And seeing as Cheritz released another game, I decided to get it, being interested in a darker storyline.\n\nLet me just say, this game is absolutely enchanting. It is another game from Cheritz, the makers of Dandelion Wishes Brought to You. (If you haven’t played it, I definitely recommend doing so as well!) Unlike its predecessor, the storyline is dark and chilling, and gets rid of a stat raising system that I missed a little bit. Also, at times, some of the character’s thoughts frightened me.  I didn’t expect to get a game over so quickly, especially in a dating sim. But it don’t let that get to you! It is a truly beautiful game. I’ve cried a multitude of times playing it.\n\nI was expecting a pretty magical storyline from Cheritz, and one I received. The story follows a girl named Eri, who is left alone in Korea as her parents work abroad. She purchases five ball jointed dolls, in hopes of reducing her loneliness. Miraculously, one day, her dolls become human. At this point the story begins to unfold. You are able to choose which character’s route you would like to go on. In the beginning you can choose to pursue Lance, Yeonho, or Yuri. Eventually you will be able to pursue Tei and Red. The reasoning for that is the storyline which will unfold itself in each of the character’s storylines despite how little information is given. I found myself surprised by all the foreshadowing.\n\nLike I said previously, the storyline of Nameless is very dark at times. While lighthearted at times, the story delves into darker thoughts of obsession and past scars. Each of the dolls have different personalities developed from how they are supposed to be doll wise. For example, Tei is supposed to be an exclusive premium doll nicknamed Prince Sunshine due to his kind and caring nature he was given as a doll. As a doll, they have a fixed set of talents and personalities that affect them as they become humans. Plus, their personalities are shaped by their pasts as any human. Some of the dolls become twisted due to how they were treated in the past. I feel like that Cheritz deals with the issue well, and it is definitely something that made me love the storyline. Each of the characters grow from their pasts.\n\nMoving on, the first thing that drew me to this game was its art. The art is absolutely beautiful, just as Dandelion is. It will most likely be the first thing you notice in this game. The color of the characters and settings complement the dark storyline. It is easy on the eyes, and is quite pretty. Another thing I really liked was, there was little difference between the doll’s human forms and doll forms. Seeing as they are ball jointed dolls, I suppose there would be little a difference. The dolls are from an actual company named Crobidoll. Let me just say, ball jointed dolls by Crobidoll are very beautiful and intricate. I would buy several Tei dolls and Zion dolls in a heartbeat if they weren’t all out of stock. *cries.\n\nWhile the art was beautiful there was some small inconsistencies in the art. Some CG’s were drawn by different people at times. But it isn’t too big an issue. The inconsistencies are not huge, and you might not even realize it’s there.\n\nNext is voice acting! I’m a huge fan of voice actors, and I believe that voice acting is something that contributes to a game greatly. I for one, will most likely put down a game or turn off the voices if the voice acting is poor or I think the voice acting doesn’t fit the character. Let me just say, if you are like me, the voice acting will not let you down. Each of the character’s personalities are brought out wonderfully by each of the voice actors, from Red’s cheerful enthusiasm to Yuri’s flirtatious nature. I will admit to crying a whole lot while I played it, and I also giggled at some of the character’s argue.  I hope I don’t sound pretty creepy for saying this… but I actually felt flattered by Yuri constantly calling the MC ‘My Honey’ and ‘My Darling’. That is how skillful the voice actors felt to me.\n\nA concern for many players seem to have is misspellings. Is it that bad? No. It’s usually just a few words missing a letter. There are not that many, but I think having an English editor would fix this issue. I’m pretty sure many would vie for the job if they were offering.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Absolutely. It has a whole lot of replay value, it’s worth the money in that aspect. Plus, you will find yourself falling in love with each and every one of the characters as you play each route. My opinion changed for several characters positively. I can definitely say that for Yuri and Tei.","January 17, 2015","true","44.1"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

I cannot thumbs up this enough, wall of text below if you're wondering why.\n\n-----\n\nI don't even know where to begin with this game.\n\nYou play as the heroine of the story, Eri as she falls in love with her dolls to reveal two bonus endings at the very end of the game. This game is deep, dark, heartwrenching, funny, sad, and makes you think about material possessions in a different light, as it thorougly draws you into the mystery and intrigue of the plot line.\n\nFirst off, the artwork is amazing in this game, bright colors, very painted shading, the backgrounds in the game are mediocre but the character art and the CG's are phenomenally good. Much like Cheritz' other game, Dandelion, all of the characters are broad and deep with good and bad in them. The bad endings are disturbing at times and can be very dark even bordering on violent, but - overall this will keep you interested all the way through. The greatest thing about this visual novel is that you really get a different experience when you're playing all of the paths because while even the first three revolve around a common path, there are still little blurbs that don't just involve the skip button which add depth and a bit of confusion for the first time playthrough anyways.\n\nOnce the steam-keys were added, I finished completing the game for the second time (Literally finished 5 minutes ago) and after months of not playing I could still remember the depth of the characters and how amazing they were. What I love about this VN, is that some of the bad endings are so disturbing yet alluring that I would save and choose the right options for the bad ends anyways, and that's phenomenal. All i wanna say is "Oma Tei" is pretty funny in a disturbing way and I had to go through and literally go "Tei, oh my god stop." because he makes an appearance in a bunch of the bad ends. Sorry for any potential spoilers there. Someone should really count the amounts of times Tei shows up unexpectedly.\n\nMy favorite path on the first playthrough was Tei, because at first glance his concept was so interesting and I usually play for the princely, usually blonde character first. He's such a broad character however once you get into it, that it is downright scary at times once you realise just how disturbed the character is under the mask he plays most of the time. My second playthrough of it however, I think Lance takes my favorite spot. The reason being is after you've gotten the whole story, Lance really is a deep character. The journal entries are really intense, and it makes me think after playing through it that Lance really doesn't want to give up on the MC with the other characters routes.\n\nThe only thing I would actually wish for would be a fully playable path with the bonus character, as after you get the second bonus ending with him, it's heartwrenching and makes me want to actually play a full path with the character. He's so disturbed and depressed that my heart was practically exploding with pain, and the bonus cg. Oh my god. way to tear my heart out Cheritz! hahaha. Seriously though, phenomenal Visual novel. I cannot say that enough.\n\nThis VN. It's amazing. If you want a tear jerking, deep, visceral, heart wrenching story with enough content to keep you reading through it for at least a few days, get this. It's well worth the price. The game's voicing is in Korean but all of the text can be read in english, if like me you cannot actually -read- korean. There are a few bugs here and there but honestly they don't break the game, they just could take a little fixing.\n\nBugs I can remember: MC's name being listed as %$ Or some symbol, during certain cutscenes, or Young %$ due to a scripting error.\n\nSpelling/grammar errors as well: Lance refers to himself as MC's "fist" doll, which made me laugh but I don't think was the intended message. And I believe there were a few typos on Yeon-ho's route as well.\n\nThere were also a few issues with grammar/translation Tei-ahjumma is better meant as "Old lady Tei" instead of momma-tei, so it's not exactly accurate, but then again Korean isn't exactly straight-forward interpretation wise... Also there were some down-right difficult to read sentences in the bonus ending that required some re-reading due to how they were worded.\n\nThat said for me, overall this game is a serious 9.8/10. If you're into visual novels, and or are looking for a good romantic visual novel as a female character, this one is hands down amazing. Unlike Dandelion, this game does not rely on stat building and is entirely dependent on choices made through reading, as such it's more like this deep heartwrenching story with pretty pictures and pretty characters. MC does act a little stupid/ditsy at times/ignorant, but aside from that all of the characters are fantastic. It's well worth the price.","May 10, 2015","true","25.4"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

And so I did, after Christmas, when I had the money, I bought Nameless , and since, I have been playing it when I have the opportunity. I'd only wished I had found this game sooner - I am a huge otome fan, and it was one of the best experiences I've had with an otome game, and one of the best investments of my money in a video game, by far. Thank you Cheritz, you have made one customer very happy.\n\nNameless is a very interesting story, which begins with Eri (the main character, name changeable) and her dolls, living a normal life, until her world turns upside down and she finds her dolls ALIVE, as humans. From this an intricate story unfolds which changes depending on which character route you are on. The full story itself akin to a puzzle - you only know the entire story and the truth when you have collected all the pieces (or in this case, finished all the routes). Some routes are even locked or unreachable until others have been completed, which you will understand once you start said routes, and I was glad they were locked before I headed onto them. There are even two secret endings only reachable after completing all the character routes. Each route is quite long, approximately 4 or 5 hours per route. Be warned, Cheritz is a company which jokes around sometimes, but definitely does not sugar coat stories; there will be times the story will force you into tears or make you shiver in terror. Anyone who has played Dandelion knows this, but even Dandelion fans should note that this is an even darker story than Dandelion. And there are many ways this game can end badly, which vary from mildly saddening to absolutely terrifying. You will experience a rainbow of emotions as you proceed through the game, and you will probably need to stock up on your tissues. I know I had to.\n\nPeople who have played Dandelion will notice one thing definitely different in Nameless in terms of gameplay, that this is a choice based game instead of a stat-raising based game, which may or may not affect your personal opinion on the game. Your choices are critical to the story, one wrong choice could mean a bad ending. Choices vary from extremely easy to pick what's "correct" to extremely subtle or misleading choices which will easily stray you onto a bad ending. There are also little minigames, such as the inevitable quiz, and a card matching game. The quiz was extremely interesting for me, and I found some of the questions easy and ridiculously funny (I had one question pop up asking if the people who work at Cheritz are aliens XD), while others were actual facts, or regarded how much you paid attention to the game. These little minigames, luckily, are not extremely difficult. You will never find them a huge hinderance unless you are just skimming through the game without paying attention.\n\nNow, onto characters; the characters were one of my favourite factors of the game. Each one of them I developed a personal opinion to, depending on my experience with them, varying from absolute love to not wanting to approach them at all. Each of the datable characters is one of her dolls and has a distinct personality, with their own strengths and flaws. None of them are "perfect". They all have their own issues which are personal, and exclusive to their route. And as the boys change, Eri changes too, in some way or another. Eri herself was a very relatable character for me, she's a high school student, conforming to social pressure whilst having a secret hobby which goes against "norms" which she fears to reveal to anyone. She's a very average teenage girl when it comes down to it, the only thing not normal is her friends and acquaintances, even prior to her dolls becoming humans. And doesn't everyone have something that they want to hide from the world as it is considered "not normal"?\nThe side characters were also good, each had their own little quirks, and were all unique in their own little ways. My favourite thing was how each side character was characterised, specifically her friends. Her best friends were not exactly like her, and this is what I enjoyed. They both had their own personality different to her own but "clicked" in well. It felt like a real friendship, they didn't always agree on everything BUT they were supportive of each other. My only little rant with this is that in certain routes these side characters are very unimportant, and sometimes just seem like they were used as filler.\n\nThe graphics deserve praise; as soon as I started the game and saw the title screen, I saw how beautiful this game is. The shading, the design, the colours are all stunning and mix together really well. Nothing in design appears "out of place". And the CGs in this game are gorgeous.\n\nAs you stare at graphics, you may also notice one more thing; references! This game is a cache of references, to Dandelion, company mascots and popular culture. They range from subtle to explicit, both in script and in visuals. It's a nice and amusing touch to the game for myself, having played Dandelion and absolutely LOVING it before this one. It should also be noted that although it is set in the same universe as Dandelion, it is not a sequel to said game; both newcomers who have never touched an otome game and experts who have played Dandelion and many other otomes will be able to enjoy this game without hassle. (Even so, I recommend playing Dandelion prior to or after playing this one as it is just a really good game!)\n\nThe music is also amazing, from the opening song to the background music. The music was well composed and pleasant to listen to. The backgound music for areas always suits the environment around them, and each of the main characters has a 'theme song' which entirely suits them. I also have to give praise where it's due for the fact that the opening and ending songs for the main character routes are sung by the actual characters' voice actors, in amazing duets.\n\nSpeaking of voice actors, they are very well done. Each character has their own voice tailored personally to them which really does suit them. It is expressed well and the actors sound devoted to the story and the character. It is in Korean only though. If this upsets you, you do have the option to turn off voices for the characters in options, so it should not be a disastrous problem so much.\n\nEven with a game as good as this one though, it is not flawless. As an English translation of a Korean game, this first issue is to be expected. There are typos and spelling errors in the game, you have no idea how many times I snickered when first was spelt as fist, or window sill window seal. These errors are, luckily, easy to ignore and only rarely break your sense of immersion in the game. There are also a few glitches and bugs, however, these are not game breaking, but they may mildly annoy you.\n\nOverall, Nameless was a spectacular success that I can definitely recommend to any otome fan. The game really shows how much the company has improved after releasing Dandelion, and I am eagerly awaiting their next game, but for now, I shall continue playing this one! Within the last couple of days of playing I have completed all good and secret endings, and quite a few of the bad endings, too. It may seem to be expensive, but the price tag is definitely worth the game.","January 1, 2015","true","76.6"," 28 of 39 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","28","39","0","4"

This game isn’t just happy times and fluff; the guys in this game all have issues. Nameless can be very cute but I don’t think there has ever been a time I have ever been so suspicious of tea.\nTo start off, I love all of the characters in the game; every single one, which doesn’t happen often in visual novels. The main character is cute and funny and is overall very likeable. The five main guys each bring something different to their routes to not make the game seem repetitive. My favorite quality about the guys is that the conditions and concepts of the dolls are incorporated into their humanized forms. The dolls that were bought used have scars from being damaged, Yuri knows how to play the drums, and Red acts like a warrior of justice. The personalities the dolls have from their concept play a major part in each of their routes which makes each route worth playing. To be honest, the side characters might be my favorite part of the game; they are just as great as the main characters, especially Soi and Shinbi. It’s refreshing to find a visual novel where the main character has friends that are legitimately good friends and care about the main character.\nThe plot of Nameless is just as interesting: beautiful dolls that come to life and live with the main character? It’s definitely an appealing setup. There is a nice mixture of content in each route. Most of the routes have their cute moments, but every route has a turning point where things get emotional, or frustrating, or just intense. The greatest part about the plot is that throughout the game there are hints of an over arcing plot that you see at the end of every route and whenever you start a new route which ties all the routes together and since Nameless is not a stat raising game like Dandelion, replaying to get all the routes is less of a hassle and you can focus on just enjoying the story.\nAlthough Nameless is great in a lot of ways, there were still a few things that I could pick out that were not so favorable. There were a few grammar issues here and there, but that was to be expected from a game that wasn’t originally in English and there weren’t enough to be bothersome. What really bothered me was that while the backgrounds, character sprites, and most of the CGs were beautiful, some of the CGs were a little awkward looking. For most of the routes it wasn’t really a problem, but for Tei’s route especially I found that most of the CGs in his route weren’t as pleasing as the some of the others, which was a little disappointing, but still not enough to take away from his route.\nOverall, Nameless is a wonderful game. $33 dollars may seem like a lot to pay for a visual novel, but for a game that is easily 30+ hours of constant entertainment, it is one of the rare visual novels where I feel it’s actually worth spending the money. It’s easily in the tops of my favorite visual novels.\n","January 6, 2015","true","2.3"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

Not only will you delight in many heart-warming and butterfly-inducing scenarios with the purchase of this game, you will also enjoy such rare and delightful experiences as: being drugged, assaulted, murdered, or just generally obsessed over. Wait, don't be scared, it's only because they love you so much!\n\nBut seriously, I do recommend this game. It's not a short or particularly easy ride, but I think it's worth it, even if you don't find the romance aspect particularly interesting. I'm not great at writing detailed, lengthy reviews, so here's a quick positives and negatives list from my perspective:\n\n\n+ The story is far more complex than you might at first suspect and is compelling enough to keep you reading through the slightly slower parts. It also covers quite a number of heavy themes such as loss, abandonment and identity, which make it a lot deeper than the premise would imply. The best, and at times most frustrating, aspect of the story however is that in order to get the full experience and reach complete understanding you do have to play all of the routes. This means there's always a certain amount of mystery and intrigue until the very end.\n\n+ By the end of the gameI found myself at least sympathizing with the characters I was sure I would forever dislike. This is largely due to the impressive amount of character development across all the story arcs, though there were a couple that really stood out. While some of the characters do at times fall into the stereotypical tropes common to otome VNs, they usually find a way of making it work for them rather than against them. Overall, I found the characters to actually be the most interesting and memorable aspect.\n\n+ The choices are meaningful and game-altering. Your decisions always have an impact, though it may not always be immediately obvious. This greatly adds to overall immersion and the feeling that you're in charge of the MC's fate.\n\n+ If you're a fan of line-art, anime or pretty things in general then you'll likely find the visuals to be delightful. The lack of noses or nipples can be disconcerting at times but overall this game is very pleasing to the eye.\n\n+ Length. I've spent nearly 50 hours on this game, most of which while using guides, and I still don't have every single bad ending yet. That being said, it could go quite a bit faster depending on how much you use the skip function.\n\n\n- There are quite a number of grammatical errors in the translation. Most of the time it's fairly easy to ignore and it doesn't impede comprehension but it can be a bit jarring.\n- An odd thing I found was that the characters can look quite different in the CG art sometimes. Certainly not a game-breaking issue, but it did make me a little sad.\n\n\nTL;DR: I was drugged and I loved it.","October 9, 2015","true","46.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","94","15","16","11","2"

While there is romance, it is rarely front and center. You will come across many themes in the process of reading , and most fall under an exploration of humanity. Too, the protagonist is a relatable if unique teenager, neither a cypher nor overtly girlish. She will, occasionally, fall prey to insecurities about her looks, but it is realistic for her age as a young, impressionable South Korean girl.\n\nI’m interested. Could you make me a bullet list?\n> I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS.\n\n\n\nG r e a t - A s - I s\n\n—  Voice acting\n—  Characters*\n—— GAL PALS i adore them\n—  Plot*\n—  Music + Sound Effects: not always memorable but always nearly appropriate. the sfx too.\n—  Presentation*\n—— movement and animation of sprites. Such energy!\n—— expressive character poses\n\n\nW i s h - I t - H a d - B u t - D i d n ' t\n\n—  A clearer, more natural translation*\n—— (means better jokes and less confusion for the plot)\n—  More QA on typos\n—  A text box I could love*\n—  Clearer controls*\n——  keyboard-controllable script rollback\n\n\n\n*let's expand on these\n\nPlot and Characterization\nI’ve combined these two, because the plot is strongly character driven. At the same time, the fantastical elements of the plot (a.k.a. world building) inform the characterization. So, for the most part, they are one and the same. This is not in any way a bad thing. I would say the characterization strong and deep enough that I’m still finding motivations and subtleties for the varied cast even a year later. The Bad Ends, especially, have been a point of discovery — while some, at first, can appear to be “random” or added simply for shock value, over time I’ve recently discovered even the most bizarre of these has a satisfying explanation by digging deeper into the plot’s world building characterization.\n\nWhile most of the game will be understandable at the shallowest level, there are enough elements implied to provide satisfaction for those who enjoy a narrative that rewards thinking about the world and the characters that live in it.\n\n>>blahblah) What I love ) Playing with tropes and archetypes, starting out familiar and branching out to make its own story from basic concepts.\n\nPresentation\nThis will be a bit more of a mixed bag, simply because there are a few elements of this visual novel’s interface I have a bone to pick with; however, let’s start with the positive elements…which is nearly everything! This game is super lovely.\n\nSo let’s get negative instead.\n\nThe Text Box. I despise it.\n\nIt is pretty, yes, BUT. See here. Not only is it the width of the screen, but it also is leaves just enough space at the bottom for a pixel-high transparent distraction. Ah!! Visual claustrophobia!\n\nDecreasing the box’s opacity in the options menu will lessen the transparent line’s impact; alas, doing so means the name tag and text box will darken wherever they touch, which is nearly as distracting.\n\nLike it or not, the text box is inescapable.\n\nControls\nWhile the controls for the most part are simply point-and-click, there are a number of things that cannot be accessed simply through a left-click of the mouse.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no indication within the game what the controls are; you have to either stumble across them by accident or surf the internet for hopes of a guide — and IMO essentials such as a menu and script should be obvious for even a first timer.\n\nThis weakness could be rectified a number of ways.\n\n- a tutorial\n- a list of (keyboard or mouse) control shortcuts\n- a help button, either on the title menu or on the interface to access a page explaining how the auto text works, skip etc.\n- or, if such cannot all be contained or too awkward to insert, a notice within the game itself on where to find such information — perhaps Online or in a readme.txt\n\nThis is especially important for Steam customers considering most won't have a Cheritz account.\n\nTranslation/Localization\nWhile the translation from Korean to English appears to be competent, having an educated grasp on the English language and idioms, it is also incredibly clunky in places; filled with typos, grammatical errors, and awkward lines of phrasing.\n\nWhile the voice acting can compensate for this weakness somewhat, this cannot be done if the player is Deaf, or for any of the Main Character’s unvoiced dialogue, thoughts, or narration. There were a few too many times I was frustrated by a confusing line I needed to interpret, or a joke that was simply unfunny due to a dully worded dialogue.\n\nThis issue could easily be remedied by hiring another person to help in the translation process, perhaps someone both capable of running through the translated text in order to help achieve a more natural feel on top of QA’ing for typos and errors.\n\nHere are some specific examples (confined to the Prologue and Common Route)\n\nInconsistencies & Contradictions. Yeonho vs. Yeon-ho in the story vs. menus. Years the grandfather passed away; was it 1 year or 3? (Especially noticeable when separated by only 15 minutes of reading)\n\nRepetitious dialogue. An abundance of repetitious lines can become irritating to read. Perhaps spicing these up or cutting parts of lines when the repetition is unnecessary.\n\n<Sample A>\nYuri snatched my fried egg and ate it.\nYeonho: "Ah... "\nYuri took away the fried egg Yeonho made.\n\n<Sample B>\nMC: "I don't really feel the need to change it… I only call and text anyways."\nIt's exactly as I said.\nI'll only be calling and texting so I don't need other fancy applications.\n\n<Sample C>\nMC: "Don't you have to take off that mask now? You've had it on for too long…"\nI'm slowly getting worried he's having it on for too long.\n\nA very similar issue with overstating. There are many times in the text where an action, subject, word, or situation is already implied from earlier text, and it is not only unnecessary but obnoxious to repeat this.\n\n<Sample D>\nOops, I got caught up in Red's prank without knowing.\nI never realize time passing by when I'm with Red.\n\nIn the above case, repeating Red’s name as the subject when ‘him’ would have been a better pick.\n\n’Chick’ I’m not sure where to put this, but this decision to literally translate Yeonho’s nickname impacted my impression of the character from beginning to end. Chick is slang for 'young woman'. It was as if he was being emasculated each time it was used. A nickname less loaded, such as Duckling would have been a better choice.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, 980000/10, 50+ hours of "♥!!!".\nPraise the egg.","January 17, 2015","true","16.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nagikomaeda/recommended/337930/","nagikomaeda","NagiKomaeda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nagikomaeda/","100 products in account","When I first found this game, I was a bit iffy. Quality in otome games is very important for me, as a useless romance story just existing for the attractive guys doesn't interest me. That's why I was hesitant to take a chance on this game - especially considering its price as compared to some of the other otome games on Steam.\nBut man, I'll tell you now - I'm glad I took the chance.\n\n"Nameless" is not only the best otome game I've ever played but also one of the top in terms of visual novel style game play with choices to affect your path. Nameless goes above and beyond the typical otome game genre, involving a mix of diverse characters, great music, many hours of gameplay with replay quality, surprising twists and turns, multiple endings, and a story that you just won't expect.\n\nSTORY:\nThis game is beyond a 'typical' romance game play. The story is intense and even unnerving at times, keeping me wanting to play continuously to figure out what was going on. As an important note, this game does have some quite violent and mildly disturbing moments, so brace yourself for those. I'd recommend following a guide to make sure you get all the endings - good AND bad. If you're looking at this game because you have a specific boy you want to get the protagonist with, it won't be worth it. To get the most of it, you need to experience every path - all the way to the "???" at the end.\nMost people suggest playing through the game in Lance > Yeonho > Yuri > Tei > Red order. Personally I think you can choose your order of the first three, but make sure you do Tei & Red last, and if anything experience Yuri's route before Tei's and Red's at the very end.\n\nCHARACTERS:\nI actually wasn't fond of many of the characters when I first started the game. Well crap, I thought, I bought this game and I don't even like the characters. But that changed as I went through the game. The characters start off very ... 'flat', I suppose. They are dolls after all; you don't see their personality much until they truly grow into human three-dimensional people. The build up is infinitely worth it. Even the character I liked the least ended up growing on me.\nThe characters do follow a bit of a stereotypical otome fashion. The blunt cold type; the womanizer; the innocent childish character; the perfect man who might not actually be so perfect; the clueless idiot. I'd say not to judge them based on this, but it is a bit hard not to. At the very least though, don't write them off as their stereotypes. Character development throughout this game is huge, with some of the development being immensely surprising, shocking, and disturbing.\nAgain, beware of the violent turns at some points in the story.\n\nART & MUSIC:\nThe artwork in this game is good quality. I can't say it is the best I've seen in a game but in the mid-top range at least. The music is what really stands out in terms of art quality. I'm unsure if the music in "Nameless" was composed specifically for the game but it is stunning, and does an excellent job in setting the tone, giving a romantic atmosphere when needed, eerie & creepy feeling when called for, and vocals in the opening and ending sequences are well-done. The voice actors did a great job of their parts, with even the side/extra characters being well done.\n\nOVERALL QUALITY & MECHANICS:\nThe characters, story, and everything else aside, the overall quality of the game itself does need a bit of criticism. There are many spelling and grammar mistakes through the game, but if you can get past that they won't subtract from your experience I'm sure. Some of them are actually rather amusing though, and I found myself snorting at them when they appeared in dramatic moments. The game could have used some more proofreading and correcting, but it is understandable and the English is not broken or hard to understand. At times the text spills out of the text boxes.\nThe mechanics are nothing particularly special, but they are suitable for the game and function as they're supposed to. I didn't run into any glitches throughout the game aside from the broken text boxes in some places.\n\nIn the end, "Nameless" - despite the flaws it has - is one of the most spectacular stories I've ever experiences. For any otome fan looking for something a bit out of the ordinary otome realm, I'd recommend this game with all my heart. I'm sure you won't regret it.","May 26, 2015","true","46.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

The lonely MC (who you can name whatever you want) lives alone, and has collected 5 BJDs (Red, Tei, Yuri, Lance, and Yeonho. Magically one day they have come to life, but not all is as it seems.\n\nI do not want to get too much into the plot to avoid spoilers, and partially I just think the plot is amazing. I collect BJDs so some parts sorta creeped me out, but overall the game was very enjoyable. Nameles was made by a Korean company called Cheritz, who also made another otome game called Dandelion ~Wishes Brought to you~. Cheritz worked with a BJD company called Crobidoll, and based the characters after actual Crobidoll BJDs.  In some ways Nameless is surperior to Dandelion, and in others it isn't.\n\nFirst off, Nameless is a pure visual novel, with choices and no stat rasising. The storyline is fantastic, and is some parts it gets much darker than Dandelion ever did. There are 5 full routes, and then 2 mini epilogue routes that are fairly short. The 5 full routes are for each of the BJDs, and all of the routes are connected. Each route had at least 1-2 bad ends based on choices, and some had up to 4 bad ends. The only downside was that you had to play some of the routes in a certain order; for example you had to play Red after Tei's route. This works really well for the storyline, but you lose some of that freedom to seek after whoever you want like in other otome games. It didn't bother me that much, and the story definitely made up for it. This game is long. On Dandelion a lot of the time is spent ont he stat raising part with events happenning every now and again. With Nameless, the routes withour stat raising easily took over three hours each; the Dandelion routes took me about an hour each, and I just played longer trying to unlock the trading cards.\n\nAs much as I love Nameless, I preferred the art in Dandelion especially the CG art, but Hatoful Boyfriend has proven that as long as the storyline is amazing, the art is not as important. Also a certain special, crazy character from Dandelion pops up in Nameless, and he does refer to Dandelion; through this character the games are connected, and I hope Cheritz continues to put this character in their future games.","July 5, 2015","true","23.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aquapainter/recommended/337930/","aquapainter","aquapainter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aquapainter/","22 products in account","Nameless ~The one thing you must recall~’s Steam port quickly follows the Steam release of Cheritz’s other Otome game, Dandelion –Wishes Brought to You-\nHaving played both the original game, and now the Steam port, I can say that the Steam release runs just as well as the original did. Bugs which previously existed for some users were quickly fixed by Cheritz. As for the content of the actual game:\n\nStory: The plot follows Eri, a girl who has been living alone due to the fact that her parents work abroad, and her only other family, her grandfather, passed away. To ease her loneliness, Eri has collected 5 ball-jointed dolls. They all come from a company that’s known for having dolls “with a soul.” Surprisingly, one day she wakes up to find all five of her dolls have turned into human boys. Through a series of misunderstandings, they begin attending school with her in addition to living together. The game follows Eri’s life as she becomes closer to the boys, and of course, the player makes choices to romance one of their choosing.\n\nNameless may have a very bright exterior and be filled with lots of jokes and fun, but it also isn’t afraid to address darker themes, such as abandonment, the fear of not being accepted for who you are, abuse, and having parents who don’t understand or connect with you. And while I can’t get too far into this without spoiling, Nameless is interesting in that it provides a canon and plot-related reason as to why you can start your game over and over again to romance different characters. This gives extra incentive to keep on playing the game, as even if you’ve finished the route of the boy you are the most interested in, you never know what the next route might reveal about the overarching plot. All this adds up to make the story a fun, engaging, and rewarding experience.\n\nCharacters: As far as the five datable boys go, I have no complaints at all. Each boy has a very distinct and unique personality, and Cheritz certainly isn’t afraid to get creative with their character set-ups. Everyone is very well developed throughout their route, and I always ended a route with a much better understanding and appreciation for the character I had finished pursuing. There is nobody who I find dislikable among the boys, as even the one I wasn’t sure I was going to like I had become completely empathetic to over the course of playing his route.\nEri herself is also well developed. She does have enough character of her own to be a well-rounded lead while still being easy to identify with. I appreciate the fact that through the routes she comes to terms with her problems with her own will and effort, and while the boys certainly do help her, none of them magically make everything better just with love. It makes for a more realistic story and character development.\n\nThe most notable side characters include Soi and Shinbi. They’re an absolute pleasure to have around. It’s actually somewhat uncommon to see an otome where the heroine has pre-existing female friends who play a large role in the story, but that’s exactly what Cheritz included with Soi and Shinbi. Both are hilarious characters in their own way, while also being wonderful friends who are fiercely protective and supportive of Eri. As well, Soi and Shinbi aren’t lacking their own development, and it was great to see that the two aren’t neglected just for being side characters. All the characters of Nameless are interesting in their own ways, and that just helps the game to shine.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay of Nameless is really quite straight-forward, as it plays out as a fairly typical visual novel. As the play you will read through character dialogue and descriptions of events, and every now and then be prompted to make a choice for Eri, which can possibly lead you to a bad ending if you are not careful. This takes up the vast majority of the gameplay, and while not done badly at all, it is just fairly standard of otomes. There is one “exam” minigame where you simply answer trivia about the game and character under a time limit, but it only occurs once per character route. If you enjoy visual novels, you’re probably not going to have any issues at all with it and enjoy it quite a bit, but if you’re not, this probably isn’t going to offer much in terms of gameplay that’s different enough for you.\nOne thing that does stand out is that you are not allowed to pursue any boy of your choice straight from the beginning. Instead, you must pick from “gems” on a menu screen, each of which representing a different boy, and you cannot access certain boys’ routes until you’ve completed other characters’ routes. This is done very purposefully, as each route is written in a certain so as that it adds up to slowly the overall plot and story, so you do not accidentally reveal big plot details early into your playthrough.\n\nIn comparison to Dandelion the quality of translation has improved. While Dandelion did not have a bad translation, there were still some distracting typos and grammar mistakes scattered throughout the game. Nameless still has a few, but there are far fewer ones than in Dandelion, and all of the dialogue flows quite nicely in my opinion. I mentioned this in my Dandelion review, but I do think perhaps having a native English-speaker do a “test reading” of the script just to sweep for any simple spelling or grammar mistakes may be beneficial to improving the overall translation quality if it is a viable option for Cheritz.\n\nArt: The art of Nameless is very nice. Pretty well everything in the game is original art, and it’s all very well done. One of the first things that got me excited about Nameless after its announcement was the color palette. The colors of Nameless are rather pastel, almost a little washed out, but it still manages to feel very bright and warm at the same time. It’s very pleasant to look at. The character sprites are all also very nice, and I really don’t have any complaints with the art style they chose to go with. Each character looks very individual and unique, and you can tell each part of their design was chosen to help emphasize their personality.\nThe CGs are all very nice too. The background are also very nice in my opinion, featuring those same soft colors I enjoy while seeming to be done well from what I can tell. Overall, I find Nameless to be a very visually pleasing game.\n\nSound: I very much enjoyed the voice-acting. Though I know due to the fact that I do not speak Korean I will not be able to pick up on certain intricacies of the acting, from what I can tell everyone does an amazing job. Each character’s voice suits them very well, and I can easily sense the emotions they are trying to convey.\n\nThe music is very enjoyable. Each track has a unique identity, and every character receives their own theme. Other than one track carried over from Dandelion, all of the music is completely original. A nice mix of instruments are used and they complement the overall feeling of the game very well. The opening theme is also very nice, and it’s cute how the lyrics are very specific to the actual plot and is obviously about all of the boys’ feelings towards Eri. Perhaps my favorite track though, is “What’s Your Name” which is a beautiful, melancholic song only for completing the secret character’s ending, and it reflects the entire game quite well. I own the OST, as I find this game’s soundtrack to be a delight and something worth having around.\n\nOverall: Cheritz has created yet another top-quality Otome game with the addition of Nameless to their lineup. It is an enjoyable and memorable experience from beginning to end, and chances are if you’re interested at all in it, you will end up enjoying it thoroughly. I would highly recommend this game as it is worth every dollar, and I excitedly await the arrival of Cheritz’s future games as well.","January 9, 2015","true","13.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

This one has considerable upgrades from Dandelion; the story is much more involved and detailed and the game play is MUCH less repetitive. But, it's mostly reading and not a lot of interaction. So, as long as you enjoy a somewhat interactive novel, you should enjoy this. Also, WOW there are some disturbing moments in this game. At times it felt like a cross between a really sweet/sexy romance and a silent hill game (survival horror) if that makes any sense. So twisted, but I liked it....not sure what that says about me.

Luckily, with Nameless, your incredibly emotional experience will be worth every penny.\n\nIt took me 22 hours to get all of the endings (using a spoiler-free guide - if not, it would take a lot longer, of course): there are 5 main pursuable characters, each with one good ending and 3-5 bad endings, plus a secret route.  Unlike many visual novels, each character's route has a wealth of unique content, so you are not just playing the exact same thing over and over again to get one or two extra scenes.\n\nI also found it to be one of the best-written games I have ever played --  I genuinely laughed and cried at the appropriate times.  Although many of the characters initially appear to conform to VN tropes, the game will consistently surprise you by revealing hidden depths to the characters and by tying their backstories very well into their personalities.  The voice acting is absolutely top-notch -- I don't understand a word of Korean, but I could still feel the emotion in each line.  The art is also pretty gorgeous, especially compared to some of the incredibly hideous stuff that has somehow made its way to Steam.\n\nFor those of you who played Dandelion (Cheritz's other Steam release), Nameless does away with all of the stat-raising from that game but still manages to be a similar length, meaning there is (I think) a lot more dialogue and actual story content in this one.  As I mentioned above, I found these characters to be generally more interesting than the ones in that game, and each route has more unique content, so playing through all of the routes doesn't feel like a slog at all.  Basically, if you enjoyed Dandelion, pick this up without a second thought.  If you didn't enjoy it, though, you may still end up loving Nameless.\n\nIn short: I, too, held off on buying this game for a while due to the price point, but I am ever-so-glad that I finally got it.  Totally worth the money.","March 18, 2015","true","30.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Cheritz deserves all the positive reviews it can get. I’m glad that I can contact the makers through this way.\n\nIntroduction:\nNameless is an otome game made by a Korean indie company called Cheritz. The clear-time for me was about 45 hours, trying to get all the endings for each of the characters. Nameless is a visual novel style game, and doesn’t require any sort of levelling up to progress through the story. You have five main characters to choose from, and unlike other games, each route is a part of the final plot after clearing all of the main characters. This slightly restricts the order in which you can choose a character – Lance, Yeonho, Yuri, Tei (only after clearing at least one of the previous three) -> Red. The entire game is voice-acted, and supports full Korean audio. I played the game in Korean, so some errors might be made with some of the romanization in this review. I also cannot comment about the quality of the English translation. I may add it later on if I play the game through English.\n\nMy recommended clear route is: Yuri -> Yeonho -> Lance -> Tei -> Red\n\nStoryline/ characters:\nPrepare to laugh, cry, and be frightened. I’m not kidding about being frightened. There were moments in this game that I was re-checking the genre the game was tagged under.\n\n*Major spoiler alert from here – if you haven’t played the game, skip this bit and read the Pros/ Cons*\n\nMy order of disturbing characters: ??? -> Tei -> Yeonho(!!) -> Lance, Yuri, Red. I guess it’s all a part of the charms of the game though – and it does add to the character’s depth. It shows the players the seriousness of the dolls’ hurts and scars (some quite literal). Most of the disturbed scenes in the game are bad-endings, so you can avoid them if you’re careful. You’ll grow to fear Tei as you work through the initial three characters and encounter their bad endings. I was suspicious of every smile and kind gesture from the gentle-looking barista by the end of Lance, Yuri, and Yeonho’s routes. Yeonho’s blank looks with his crazed murmurs were pretty darn horrifying too. Even more so because you don’t expect it. However, there is a reason for Tei’s and Yeonho’s behaviour – they were both second-hand dolls. Both abandoned, and both previous owned by psychotic owners that could both feature in thrillers of their own.\n\nAll five dolls have different insecurities. All quite severe and all very different. ‘I want to be special’, ‘I want to love truly’, ‘I want a purpose’, ‘I want to be clean’, and ‘I want to be good’. All of course, desiring your love and attention as their owner. It’s pretty adorable how they all look to the player for those two things.\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, each routes must be cleared for the final ending. Only the first three playable characters have common routes at the beginning. Tei and Red is specialised from the start. Since Red’s route was the last, I found it to be a lot more detailed than the other routes. This is also reflected by the amount of cutscenes he has in comparison to the other characters. I won’t go into too much detail, but Red made me cry. His character is truly unique, special, and very believable. Lance was quite special too – I could emphasise with his insecurities well. Yeonho’s and Yuri’s route disappointed me a little. Especially Yuri’s – it just seemed a little shallow and lacking in comparison to the other routes. His personality was a bit off-putting too, but I guess that’s personal preference. Tei’s route was disturbing and well-written. Completely worth the shudders I got from all his bad-ending appearances. ??? was unexpected and his scenes with the merry-go-round was pretty disturbing. But the last cutscene with him (was quite lucky stumbling into it. I won’t spoil, but nothing to do with clicking options.) was quite sweet, so I forgave him of all his creepiness.\n\nI realise that I’ve mostly been talking about the stranger aspects of the characters. Do note that I am writing a massive review, and I loved the game enough to spend the time doing so. All the characters are endearing; some are very hot; some are unexpectedly perverted (yes, I’m looking at you, Lance.); some are adorable; and most of them will make you squeal and blush at least once.\n\nThe other NPCs were pretty cool. I was quite surprised at how deep Soi’s character was. Initially, I imagined her to be the main character’s stereotypical rival in love, but she was much, much more than that. Her friendship with the player was an additional depth to the storyline. I was a little sad that Zion wasn’t a playable character. Loved his design and voice (and his crobidoll form is so adorable). Oh, and welcome back, magician! He was quite a nice touch by Cheritz to include in Nameless.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics of the characters were amazing. The different poses, the blinks, and moving mouths – all were perfect. Natural and convincing. The one big downside was the quality of some of the cutscenes… You’re meant to want to come looking for them again, but I found that I didn’t really look back for any except one or two (mostly lance’s). I actually found some of it damaging to the story development because I found the playable character quite ugly in the scene. It was especially disappointing because everything else was stunning.\n\nSoundtrack/ Voice acting:\nThe soundtrack was what really pulled me into the story. I loved it. Each of the character’s themes are perfect to the character’s personality, and what I especially loved was that the sountracks weren’t… cheap-sounding. If that makes sense. The voice acting was fantastic. Tei’s voice was by-far superior to any. The emotional aspects of his story was partly only achievable through the amazing voice acting. The other voice actors were very good too, of course.\n\nConclusion:\nThe difficulty of the game wasn’t high. I cleared most of the game without the need of searching through walkthroughs. There are some tricky options though, so make sure to keep quick saving. The ending was a little disappointing for me – but this is definitely due to my tastes. I didn’t like how suddenly every route combined with each other and yees. You end up with the five characters you’ve cleared the game with. I wish at the end, there was an option to who saves you, so the ending with that character becomes the true ending.\n\nSo my opinions in a nutshell:\nPros:\n+ Stunning character graphics\n+ Awesome voice acting\n+ Unbelievably in-depth, immersive storyline with hours over hours of gameplay\n+ Hot and endearing characters\n+ Excellent play-back value\n+ Beautiful OSTs\n+ No need to grind for silly stats\n+ You will most definitely cry, laugh, and be quite frightened\n+ Cheap for what you’re getting in the package\n\nCons:\n- Some bad quality cutscenes.\n- What’s up with the ending?\n- Some disappointing routes\n- Sold out drama CD. PLEASE GIVE ME DUMMYHEAD DRAMA CD (of Red) DLC!!! It’s pretty mean of Cheritz to release the teasers on YouTube and release it only for a short while (cries). I don’t care how expensive it is, or if it’s only in Korean (I’ll translate it all for free!!!); please release it as a DLC/ re-release the CDs!! I’ll be a slave to your company for life!!\n\nAnyways, all I can say to you is: if you’re interested enough to dig around for reviews, just play it. Do it. You won’t regret it ♥\n","February 3, 2015","true","45.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I have played and watched other people play romance games like this before, but most of them are different in that they have a mechanic where you raise a stat (Like intelligence or beauty) in order to progress with your love interest. Even though I liked these games too, that mechanic felt repetitive and tedious at times, because I just wanted to find out what would happen next in the story. Nameless, however, does not use this mechanic. The game progresses based entirely on your dialogue choices. How you choose to speak and act towards the other characters will affect how the story unfolds.\n\nI have only one real negative critique of the game, which is that it could use a patch to fix the spelling and grammatical errors in the translation. If you are someone who absolutely cannot stand misspellings and typos, then you may not want to pick up the game until those are fixed. However, if you can look past the errors (which probably occurred during translation), then you will find a really great story, which is the main reason why I recommend this game.\n\nThe story and characters are very strong. The voice acting is done well, and it gives you a sense of each character's personality. The characters feel three-dimensional, and they are very likeable across the board. I was especially happy that the main character has a real personality and sense of humor, unlike some romance sim main characters, who feel rather flat and colorless. The romantic interests also have very interesting personalities, motivations, and stories of their own, which has kept me wanting to play through until I have seen every piece of the story. I have not played through every path yet. However, the stories and characters in Nameless are so intriguing that I plan to try to get every ending, good and bad. The creators of Nameless have made a game that has a story which is sweet, funny, sad, and even sometimes terrifying, and I heartily recommend it.","January 17, 2015","true","81.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

But she is also kind and so far realistic. The way she talks and reacts during the story feels natural and real and I often find myself agreeing with her or sharing her thoughts. It really helps pull you into the story that is unravelling when there's that connection.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this game for otome/visual novel lovers!","December 28, 2015","true","4.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This game was released shortly after. For a new company, they have done excellently on both games. I have yet to pay Dandelion but I plan to in the upcoming future. As for this game, it already has so many noticeable improvements in such a short period of time. Before playing this game, I do recommend playing Dandelion since I feel like the games are somehow connected. Both even feature the "Wizard." That won't be much of a spoiler. Anyway, this game doesn't have many features as it does in Dandelion, but for me that is a good thing. You go along with the story easily, listening to mostly just dialogue. The artwork is wonderful, the story is so well put together. I love how every guy's path connects with one another. It's so wonderfully pieced together that I can say that I am definitely impressed. Your choices mean everything, but luckily there is a walk through to help you earn every ending, good and bad. Trust me when I say that you will want the bad endings as well. However, some of the characters are a little too similar. Like Yeonho, Tei, and ???. I just find their characters all to be quite alike with a few differences. Still, I love the game. I plan to replay it again just for the fun of it. As this is Cheritz second game, I can't wait to see what will be to come in the future. They're already working on a new game called "Mystic Messenger" which will be released to mobile devices making it their first mobile game. You can find out more about it on their official website, they already released a video of it as well as the game's system. The release date still hasn't been released for any specific day, but it was postponed to sometime this June.\n\nDLC's for this game include the Black & White Christmas along with a few others. The B&W Christmas DLC is something that I recommend to purchase as it let's you continue the story even after the ending. The other DLC's are just for fun to listen to, but B&W Christmas is the only one that really relates to the game itself.\n\nIf you're a fan of otome games, or if you want to get into otome games, I definitely would try out both of Cheritz games as they are definitely a trustworthy company. You get what you pay for when you purchase one of their games. I will admit that there are a few typos in the translations, sometimes the servers will be down, or sometimes the game will freeze (as I said, this is only their second game so they still have to improve on a lot.) but other than that there's really no reason you shouldn't give this game a chance.

I am a very, very fast reader, so results are probably not typical and most will spend a bit more time in the game.\n\nI downloaded the demo at first. I've only (pretty) recently gotten into the visual novel scene so the price seemed pretty high to me. But I realized quickly that you don't see many otome games and I've never seen one with VAs. The demo was enough to pull me into the storyline and take a chance on the full game.\n\nAll I can say is: holy crap. The storyline is absolutely addictive. I really enjoyed the music and the art is also quite lovely. While I can't understand Korean one bit, the VAs seemed wonderful. Soi and Red's VAs really stood out for me - the tones of their voices seemed to go perfectly with the characters.\n\nThe gameplay was a bit different than what I was used to: no stat grinding/leveling up/etc. The stat stuff is OK at first but then it just becomes a hassle whenever you get into the storyline. Instead, this is just decision based, so it is easy to focus on just the story itself. I much, much prefer this, even though it seems easier to get to the bad ends/game overs sometimes for one "wrong" decision you made early in the storyline.\n\nThe character development and storylines are great. There aren't any heroes (well, maybe one!) or "perfect" boyfriends here.  I'm all for characters with psychological issues and this sure the hell delivers. A few "bad" answers and the love interest's psyche shatters. And sometimes, the MC's psyche shatters. I love it! The MC also is not a perfect lady and has a great personality. It's fairly easy to relate to her.\n\nI also really liked how the storyline slowly began to clear up, different things were revealed... I was quite surprised on my third storyline.\n\nThe game does have a few issues with typos, grammar, and sometimes the formatting. I saw elipses being "centered" in a couple of storylines, while they were all normal [...] in the others. There were also some inconsistencies such as... "Young Me" and "Young %n (broken - MC's name did not transfer properly)" "Girl [Korean Character]" instead of "Girl #" and I think a few gender inconsistencies (Maybe they were not inconsistencies but it definitely stood out to me.). It wasn't enough to break it for me but I couldn't help but to snicker at some of the issues.\n\nPutting the menu on right-click was a different choice and I quicksaved for about an hour or two until I accidentally figured it out.\n\nOverall, this game was definitely worth my $30 and I have no regrets. It was a wonderful story with beautiful art and great VAs. I hope to see more from Cheritz in the future.","January 8, 2015","true","35.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

For an entirely text based game at least.\n\nI've never actually played a Korean visual novel before this one.  Plenty of Japanese VNs yes but I love visual novels and otome games so I figured this one looked interesting enough.  At first the korean dialogue was a bit odd to my ears but the voice acting in this game is fantastic and I came to love it when a character would go on a long rant.  The character art and CGs are really great too.  Weird yet interesting story as a whole and each one of the dateable boys has their own story and those were great in the sense that they really made you feel for the character and brought them alive.\nHonestly there's too many little things I could cover.  Is it the best otome game I've played? No probably not.  Is it the worst? HELL NO.  I'd say in terms of creativity and appeal this would be in my top whatever list and I'd definitely play it again at one point.\nYou might like Cheritz's other game Dandelion if you like this (and don't mind very particular stat raising.)\n\nBut yes not for everyone of course but I definitely recommend it if you like otome games.","February 16, 2015","true","56.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have hardly played the Steam version, but I have played the game.*\n\nEri (name changeable) lives alone (of course) in the house that her and her now deceased grandfather used to share. Ever since she was a child, Eri has been collecting expensive ball-jointed dolls. Her parents are always away on business, so Eri was closer to her grandfather than her own parents. This also caused Eri to form strong attachments to her ball-jointed dolls and treat them as if they were people. One day, Eri’s dolls come to life and now her house is full of unnaturally attractive men.\n\nUnlike Dandelion, the first game Cheritz made, Nameless has no stat raising elements. This allows there to be more focus on the side characters. Where as in Dandelion there was only one side character, Nameless has five side characters, each with their own distinct yet believable personalities and relations to the main character. Eri may be living alone, but she does not progress through the story alone. Her two best friends Shinbi and Soi are always trying to help Eri through hard times. There is also Hobin, the owner of Café Banjul where you will be spending a lot of playtime, and Zion, one of the waiters. It would have been interesting to see a short side route for Hobin or perhaps even a full route for Zion. Of course, the most entertaining character in the entire game is by far Yujin, the school doctor. He is in love with his skeleton model named Beatrice and often makes Eri go on errands for him. His comments and overall personality adds some humor to the game.\n\nAs opposed to most otome games where the suitors do not know the main protagonist or one is her stereotypical best friend, all of the suitors in Nameless know and love Eri and understand her loneliness. Their relationship starts out awkward since they were dolls who came to life, but this is quickly replaced with a feeling of family. Eri has lived alone for 3 years, having only the dolls as her company. Now she can actually talk to them and have them talk back. Each of the suitors also has their own unique ‘problem’. Most problems stem from the suitors trying to break free or follow the design guidelines that the doll company made. For example, Red was created as a ‘Super Hero’ style of doll and Yeonho was bought online and had a previous owner. You can speculate on your own how this might influence the doll’s actions and personalities. Living without almost any family influenced Eri’s personality as well, but she still reacts to situations much like anyone else would. She accepts that the dolls came to life, yet starts to panic when she realizes that five attractive guys will be living with her. Her expressions are on par with the protagonist of Dandelion and it is refreshing to have a strong protagonist in an otome game. The player can easily relate to each of Eri’s actions. This makes it somewhat difficult to pick the ‘correct’ dialogue option since many are realistic reactions to the situation.\n\nThe routes of the games have to be played in partial order. Lance, Yeonho, and Yuri must be played first, then Tei, then Red. Lance’s, Yeonho’s, and Yuri’s routes start out almost the same until you actually get onto their path. Even then, some moments are a little similar. Tei’s and Red’s routes are overall completely different than the other routes. The ‘hidden’ route has almost no similarities whatsoever and must be played last. Having the ‘hidden’character be last makes sense, but the order of play felt odd. I felt that Lance made the most sense as the person to end up with Eri, but apparently Yuri and Yeonho are just as likely. Never once did I think Eri should end up with Red, and yet he is the last main route played. As for what order you should play in, there is no real reason to play any of the first three in a particular order. I would recommend Yuri first since Yuri seemed the least connected to Eri out of the three. I played, Lance, then Yeonho, then Yuri, but that was probably not the best way to play. Recommended play order: Yuri – Yeonho – Lance.\n\nMany of the choices in the game once on a characters’ route have unforeseen consequences. Otome games always have right and wrong choices, but the consequences are often almost immediate or close to immediate. Most of the time, you will not know if you picked a bad choice until much later in the game. One seemingly trivial decision can cause a bad ending solely on its own. I remember one such instance in Lances’ route in particular. Several of the bad ends involved one particular character and completely changed my opinion of him; I did not even want to play his route.\n\nYou can unlock diary entries for each of the characters, including the side characters. You can also unlock voice clips of the different characters. These are often unlocked by getting the endings, bad endings included, and beating the two mini games. There is a card matching game and a quiz over facts about Nameless, Dandelion, Cheritz, and just random facts. You can quick-save right before each mini game to ensure A+’s on each. For the quiz, most answers can be found on the games’ websites but simple memorization can allow you to pass without actually hunting down the information.\n\nThe music in the game added to the slightly dreary mood and the characters. Yujin’s and Yuri’s themes were my personal favorite themes. Red’s theme matches his ‘ready for action’ personality and Yeonho’s theme had an innocent feel to it. Sadly, the opening video did not have a translation for the theme. Only a translation for the ending theme is available and that is only in the separate drama CD.\n\nThe voice acting was well done. All of the voices matched what you would picture for the characters. Soi’s and Yeonho’s voice actors in particular did a good job at executing different emotions. Yujin’s voice actor also did an excellent job at really sounding in love with Beatrice so I suppose that is a good thing.\n\nIf you have played Dandelion, then you know how the game is going to end. None of the endings felt very happy, even the ‘true end’ with the hidden character. The routes end abruptly and they are not open ended. The endings still felt less depressing than Dandelions’ endings.\n\nThe CG’s in the game held less emotion than the Dandelion CG’s did. The CG’s were often just someone sitting or standing, not really doing anything. Also, the CG art really reminds me of the CG art from Dandelion. The pastel art style of the game did not transfer to the CG’s. I enjoyed both art styles, but the pastel art really set the melancholy mood of the game.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the player must name their first doll. The game does not give you any clue as to what this is so people may just put their names in. Unfortunately, after naming the first doll, it then asks for the protagonist’s name. Do not make the same mistake; name the first doll something other than your own name.\n\nOverall, Nameless is a strong otome title. The storylines all interlock well yet still retain distinct differences. Each character is different and truly loves the protagonist. The supporting cast has almost as much screen time as do the suitors. Even on a character’s route, the other suitors are still integral parts of the game. The art style is unique and the music is often very aristocratic sounding, both of which set the tone of the game. I would highly recommend this game, but I personally enjoyed Dandelion more.\n","January 17, 2015","true","4.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

They make you think, make you read (a ton), make you fall in love with each and every character. They get into the very marrow of the human condition.\n\nI played this after loving every minute of Dandelion - a game I didn't think could be topped. Dandelion was full on stat raising, meticulous work that really paid off with super emotional endings (but the really bad endings were even better!). Nameless is similar, continuing the basic premise while stripping away everything but the story and your choices. A fluffy little love story this is not. The dolls-turned-boys each have their own backstories and issues, and so do you! There's a growth and maturity that occurs in each storyline, but it's equally as easy to make a choice that will lead to death, violence, and a special cup of ZZZ tea.\n\nI loved the fact that you can name your main character anything, and I also think she's an improvement over the doormat of a protagonist in Dandelion. Her best friends are great additions to the plot. There's more of a sense of momentum, too, because of the insane workings of Nameless and a certain wizard that grow increasingly crazy with each timeline. Oh, and the voice acting! I don't speak Korean, but it blew me away. It really adds a depth to these characters, bringing them to life. And the artwork! I felt like taking a screenshot every 5 minutes, haha. It's gorgeous.\n\nThe cons? A little bit of engrish text here and there, nothing too distracting. There could be some more sexy scenes, probably... but would that ruin the romance? Not sure. The worst part was how this took over my life for a few days! I absolutely had to finish it. And after 20+ hours and a secret ending, I can definitely say this is a must-buy for any visual novel fan. The price is a little expensive, but you're getting SO much for it.

This was my favorite of the two. The story is, at first, beautifully entertaining, exciting, and fun, but as you delve deeper into the available routes, and unlock more... you encounter a chilling realization. This story is FAR deeper than it first appears. I spent 25 hours getting to know each and every characters and fell deeply in love with all of them.\n\nNameless is heavily story driven, where more than anything this is a NOVEL and not necessarily a game beyond the fact that you can make your own decisions. It truly is one of the most story packed Otome's I have played in quite a while. Below I will detail what I liked and did not like (because yes, even a gem such as this has its imperfections).\n\nPROs: Absolutely amazing and engrossing story, you'll find it difficult to pull away from this one.\nEver evolving story. Text will not always be the same in common routes as well, but in the actual character routes it is almost entirely different. You will not be pressing "Skip" much at all except some instances in the common route section. As you unlock more routes, the story continues to evolve.\nCharacters are well fleshed out, and totally voice acted (in Korean, not English, but it's still great!).\nNo "dating sim" click this, click that, raise this stat and that stat! Though stat raising does have it's charms at some point, I commend Cheritz for leaving it out of this particular title. You get to learn so much more about the story and characters this way (and without the monotony of those "daily" chores). It's much more relaxed.\nGorgeous art (with some exceptions, will list in CONs as well)\n\nCONs: Some of the CG art just didn't seem of the same caliber as others, or didn't seem to match the character art that you see throughout the game.\nThere are some vexing typos, misspellings, and grammatical errors (as well as using one of the character's names when they meant someone else). These can be ignored unless you're quite OCD about it. It's easy to understand what they had meant. Basically, it's not unreadable in any way, shape, or form. (Think of it as an embarrassing hiccup that does not detract in any way from the overall story).","May 29, 2015","true","25.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The character illustrations are beautiful, and all the backgrounds (apart from one) were also drawn to a very high standard. They certainly contributed to how much I enjoyed the game. The music is also enjoyable, if a bit repetative, it serves to enhance the mood of each scene. I wouldn't spend money on the OST though.\n\n[First Playthrough: Lance's Story]\n\nI managed to finish Lance's story with one good ending and the two bad endings. Actually, the good ending was lovely and the bad endings were really disappointing. I just felt 'meh' about them. I will be playing Yeonho's story next. It's nice that with each ending (good or bad) you get little glimpses of the over-arching plot. That's a nice touch and increases replay value.\n\n[Update: Yeonho's Story]\n\nI actually really disliked this one. Yeah I get it, he's cute, abused and vulnerable. Except those last two really aren't attractive traits and here they have been greatly romanticised. The way the heroine acts towards him isn't right at all. She isn't helping him no matter what she does. And the bad endings... Well. What the hell? It made me extremely uncomfortable. And didn't make sense at all, actually. Messed up.\n\n[Update: Yuri's Story]\n\nI only just started this one but I already like it a lot better. The character is a pervert and seemingly in control of this emotions, so that's makes his deviousness more fun for me. It's the most enjoyable route so far for my preferences! After advancing through his story, I have to say it's my favorite playthough so far. Yuri has my vote for top boy (so far)!\n\nAnd... I stopped there. Although the art is beautiful, the repetitiveness of the story (even with different romances) and the fact the main character became a terrible Mary Sue left me thinking I had other games to play. I especially couldn't stand her reactions in Yuri's story.

The hours displayed is not a good indicator of my playtime of this game (which isn’t any different from the original version) or how much I love this game.\n\nNameless ~ The One Thing You Must Recall is a compelling and somewhat complex story about a young woman (Eri) and her ball-joint dolls (BJD) who have mysteriously gained a human body. Chertiz brings back a familiar (and very welcome) face as one of the two mysterious males who appear to be the antagonists of this story.  Unlike its predecessor, Nameless is a pure visual novel with a few mini-games to break up the hours of story content (which is a welcome relief for some).  If potential players are looking at buying the typical otome game where everything is happy and angst is completely off the table then I would like you to turn around and walk away this instant… and come back when you’ve decided to explore the otome genre a bit more.  Nameless is not going to be good for everyone; it has some pretty dark and potentially triggering themes but I believe for this very reason, Nameless at it’s core, is an amazing story that begs to be explored.\n\nAt first glance, Nameless appears to be a very linear and somewhat predictable story, supported by a very attractive male cast that takes the form of the typical; Tsundere, handsome-and-knows-it, energetic-innocent, the cute one and team dad/mom, that otome games are notorious for. And sure, if you’re going to just give it an hour of playing then yes, that’s exactly what you’ll l see.  Unlike a lot of mainstream (english) otome games, Chertiz brings a real depth to their characters. None of their characters are to be taken at face value; especially the ones that you think are going to be a certain type of person. I was blown away at how much effort went into the characters; especially how they went beyond being just their stereotypes. Chertiz brought us interesting characters with Dandelion but with Nameless they brought us complex and damaged characters.\n\nPlaying Nameless will give you a warm fuzzy feeling but it will also make you feel completely and utterly guilty for ever leaving your childhood toys in that box in the attic. So if you’re ready to embark on a beautiful journey of self-acceptance and love then press that purchase button and play until you cry. <3","January 17, 2015","true","6.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Throughout the story, there is much intrigue over how her dolls have taken on human forms, and with each route you play you come closer and closer to finding the truth.\n\nThere is no stat-building in Nameless, and the Status page on the main menu only provides a short bio of the five main characters, so it may be a tad difficult to know if you have made the correct decisions to reach the "true" ending of any given path; however, this also makes it a bit easier to get all of the possible endings a path may have, as it usually only requires only one or two "incorrect" choices to be made to trigger a bad ending. This, combined with the time-saving Skip feature, makes replaying for the sake of getting all the endings convenient. Nameless also features a Memory section on the main menu, where you can view any scene you have viewed before--a great addition for those who want to experience a specific section of the story again.\n\nThe characters in Nameless are very well-developed, each with very unique personalities and conflicts. The five main characters each have their own route in which the protagonist watches them confront their flaws and grow from it--and the protagonist herself shows some character growth, as well. Even the secondary characters, such as the protagonist's friends, Soi and Shinbi, are surprisingly developed and enjoyable--a rare sight in otome games, where the focus is almost exclusively placed on the dateable characters. The characters you meet are easy to get attached to, even if they are not one of your dateable dolls, which ultimately adds to the charm of the game; regardless of whose route I was on, I would always enjoy when Soi and Shinbi were around, and I would be happy to visit Banjul to see Mr. Hobin and Zion. I would genuinely look forward to seeing how they grew and reacted to the situations around them.\n\nThe visuals of the game are beautiful, and the music is fun and fitting. The voice acting is top-notch, and adds even more enjoyability to the characters. There is a massive amount of content, as I have not completed every route even after playing for over 27 hours. Each path is lengthy, with a lot of different events and CG's. Some bad endings can be surprisingly dark, but still add to the overall tone of the game, which becomes almost tragic as you try to piece together the identities of the two unknown figures who seem to be involved in bringing your dolls to life (if you have played Cheritz's previous game, Dandelion, which I also recommend, you may be able to recognize a certain voice and see some overlapping themes, but it is not required to fully enjoy this game). The game is usually light-hearted, but prepare to feel a myriad of emotions throughout each route.\n\nNameless is a thoughtful and emotionally provoking game, with very strong characters and mysteries that keep the reader hooked. I highly recommend this powerful, moving title.","January 18, 2015","true","27.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I bought this game on a whim due to the nice aesthetics, great professional artwork and character design, definitely a grade above most visual novels on the market. I was excited to finally get my steam keys to add it library after owning it for a year.\nWhat I didn't expect was the great voice acting, nice soundtrack and most importantly awesome plot-lines that left me baffled, it was almost inception-like. Not to mention the 30 hours worth of gameplay.\nThe main heroine has got a no nonsense attitude while also being quite compassionate. The love interests are also really intriguing, each boy struggling with their own problems and having varying interactions with the heroine depending on your choices.\nWith some meta-references littered throughout the game along with good humor and a few extras, it's one of the most enjoyable VN's I've played yet.  I felt a void after playing this game and if that's an indicator of great storytelling, this is certainly something you shouldn't miss.","January 15, 2015","true","19.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Where do I even begin?\n\nOkay, so I started off by accidentally stumbling onto the game Dandelion thanks to Youtube.  I've played otome games before so that was one thing that wasn't new for me.  But the stat-raising thing was definitely something.  When I first went through that game I thought it was another silly game that I would just laugh through.  Haha, boy was I TERRIBLY WRONG!  The characters crawled their way into my hearts while my guard was down and made me CARE!  And the story...  Going through all of it made my heart break several different times again and again.  Going through the stat-raising, which I was neither fond or disliking towards, felt so worth it at the very end.\n\nSo when I magically found out that the same company came out with this game, you wouldn't believe my excitement.  I immediately went to find the demo and played through it.  First off, the artwork is absolutely GORGEOUS!  I was blown away by the different settings and how all the characters looked.  Then the voice acting... music to my ears.  Then of course there was the actual music which was great.  Then the fact that they got rid of the stat-raising completely and replaced it with your standard (at least what I am used to) option-clicking in order to get the happy end with your man of choice.  There was a lot more to read and absorb from than Dandelion which was impressive and something I could appreciate.  I also felt that the main female protagonist was more relatable in certain ways and that it was alright to connect with her.  There were things that I could just GET, you know?  And the guys?  So diverse!\n\nThe demo was so good that I had to buy the full version.  So far, the money spent is totes worth it.  Seeing the scenes that were in the demo in the actual game was a great joy to see 'cause 1) things made more sense in scene and 2) it was just super exciting to recognize the stuff.\n\nCheritz has SERIOUSLY upped it's game since Dandelion and I am so happy that they are doing great.  I hope they continue to improve and grow as they make more games.  I'm seriously looking forward to whatever it is that they come up with next.  I only completed Yuri's good-end route (with the help of a guide), but I am already greatly excited to complete ever single route (yes, the bad ones as well) so that more of the plot will unravel (like I know it will). :)\n\nIf anyone is still on the fence about it, just try out the demo.  It's not going to hurt you to give this game a shot. ^_^","December 29, 2014","true","47.9"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

Is this game worth buying? Yes! Does it have issues? ... also yes. Normally I'd recommend this one on sale, except it never seems to be on sale. The game has some very strong points, and as many a reviewer prior to me has pointed out: it has ALL THE FEELS. But for something this pricy, one would think it would be more polished than it is.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, the interface functionality is a step up from Dandelion, and the background music is not intrusive. This is a plus given how often one has to listen to it on a loop. The characters are also very engaging, and for anyone interested in the subject of transhumanism, this game provides some good thought fodder. Some of the routes are hilarious, others are downright disturbing, so buyer beware if you're expecting nothing more than a light hearted wish fullfillment.\n\nAs for gameplay itself: the emphasis this time is definitely on the 'novel' end rather than the 'game' end. No stat management, although there are decisions to be made regarding how you respond to the characters that determines how things go.\n\nAlthough I'm no believer in a "perfect" game, I do think a game should be polished, and there are some issues here that really should've been caught before the release, and haven't been fixed nearly a year later. They really needed someone to check the spelling, grammar, and punctuation for the translation. Sometimes the love interest's names aren't capitalized, things are misspelled, and there's frequent confusion between "you / your / you're."\n\nThe skip button sometimes does not work, and this is an important function in a game where the opening sequence is nearly an hour long on its own, and you'll be revisiting it at least three times, or more if you're like me and have an impulse to be nice to everyone and keep getting an accidental game over. It also occasionally forgets what the main character's name is, even if you left said name on default.\n\nConclusion: It feels a bit odd to say this, since normally I have the opposite problem. But I love the game's characterization and art and plot. I don't have issues with the story. I wish they'd taken more care with the functionality or had at least released fixes for what was wrong. The translation fixes, being text based, one would think would be an easy thing to do.","January 12, 2015","true","139.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

From my understanding there are no changes of written content between versions, so my review should still remain relevant.\n\nNameless is easily one of the most impressive otome games I've played in recent times. For those of you who enjoyed Dandelion, wait no further. Produced by the same company that created Dandelion, Nameless is much like a spiritual successor to the popular stat-raiser, even moving on to become something much greater that keeps you at attention the whole ride through.\n\nSo, what's the deal with Nameless? It's a dating sim that was created in collaboration with Crobidoll, a manufacturer of ball-jointed dolls. And relax, even if you're not familiar with that particular type of doll, you can follow the story with ease. The story retains the Cheritz touch, now adorned with beautiful pastel art and character portraits that blink smoothly.\n\nNameless features a plot that spans the entirety of the routes, following the tale of a girl and her doll. You'll be surprised to learn the intricacies that each of the (formerly ball-jointed) love interests hide within their heart; normally this fact alone would be sufficient for an intriguing story, but everything adds up to a fantastic and impressive finale that will milk your tear ducts dry.\n\n---\n\nLovely Art\n\nThe art composition is simply fantastic. The character sprites mesh well with the backgrounds and they complement each other to the point one may wonder if it was a happy coincidence or done purposely. The anatomy isn't much of a problem (though consistency can be a problem when comparing CGs), and the art accomplishes what it seeks to. The game establishes a wonderful atmosphere of its own through the attention put into the visuals.\n\nAtmospheric Music\n\nDiscarding the hip and stylish music of Dandelion, Cheritz aims for a softer, gentle feel with the background audio for Nameless and it works without becoming dull. And of course, the BGM can easily boost up the tension when the scene calls for it (and boy, do some scenes call for it).\n\nBesides the opening music for Nameless, there are also four ending songs (Lance&Yeonho, Red&Tei, Yuri&Yujin, "What's Your Name?").\n\nCharacters with Depth\n\nI feel that the true strength of Nameless is in the depth of the characters and the interactions between them. Some characters hide more beneath their surface than others. But all of them are brilliantly written and have problems that need solving; the fact that they are dolls is not ignored, and adds a lot to their character that wouldn't otherwise be there.\n\nTouching Story... with some small rough edges.\n\nI had heard before purchasing Nameless that there was inescapable Fangirl Mobs, as it is, that surround every single member of the romanceable cast. And it's true! I do not recommend this game to those who cannot stand such things. The thing is, though I despise such things, how they interact with the Fangirl Mob shows, and causes, character growth. Because of this, I was able to overlook it.\n\nBesides this plot device the story was, as I said before, probably the most enjoyable otome game I have had the pleasure of playing in recent time. It would be spoiling to explain its brilliance in detail, but the characters and how they all come together was executed fabulously. The story is more about developing the relationship so things end quite quickly after the couple gets together, which may be disappointing for some audiences.\n\nThere were bad ends where things felt too sudden, and/or even anticlimatic. On the other hand, there were also bad ends that added quite a bit of depth that wouldn't have otherwise been there (yay, worst-case scenarios!).\n\nConvenient System\n\nA straight VN not too different from a choose-your-adventure novel where you read the story and are faced with options that will lead you to different endings (to tell you ahead of time, there are several bad endings and one good ending per character route). All the characters are voiced except Eri, the heroine.\n\nThere is a diary feature in the right-click menu that conveniently summarizes and occasionally, adds depth to the events in the game for you. You can even flip through the pages. It's very useful for those who play erratically and must recall their stopping point, but this feature also plays a part in the plot itself.\n\nThere is an auto-save and even a whole page for your quick saves on the load screen, so you have little to fear in case your game crashes and you lose your spot. This was very convenient!\n\nIn the "Extras" menu, you may go over the content you've covered in the "Memory" and "Album" section. This is quite the handy feature for whenever you want to view a scene again, but remember you can't use the right-click menu (and thus, cannot view texts nor the diary) as you would be able to in-game.\n\nAs an added bonus, this game is trilingual, allowing you to flip between Japanese, Korean, and English (you have to return to the menu when you switch, though).\n\nA Bit Picky, But...\n\nIn terms of prose, the game was a bit lacking. I cannot be a judge of the translation as I don't understand Korean, but the writing could definitely improve. Especially for visual novels where the writing is one of the most important parts, I believe that fluid English is important. Most importantly, I think this game would benefit from an editor who is proficient in what they do; there was the occasional typo when I played the non-Steam version. I even noticed they would mention things that never happened since I chose a different choice.\n\nAs for SFX, well... there were times when it was a bit strange, but nothing too out of order.\n\nConclusion/Thoughts\n\nNice game with nice music and visuals and even nicer story. A must-play for people who don't have a phobia of dolls.","January 18, 2015","true","173.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's good and worth getting, but don't expect it to be like Dandelion.\n\nAs similar as the two games are, they are also quite different. The stat leveling was a fun grind in Dandelion, and at first I was bored with Nameless because actual gameplay/choices don't really affect or change anything in the game. But it wasn't long before I just sat back and enjoyed the visual novel of Nameless.\n\nTear jerker-wise, Dandelion was more poignant and moving to me. Nameless has its moments too but not as powerfully as Dandelion in my own opinion.\n\nMusic! I love the opening theme of Dandelion and it gets stuck in my head, but none of the other songs really stood out. Nameless? The vocal songs I wasn't really a fan of, but everything else? Beautiful!\n\nThe main thing I do dislike about Nameless is that the female lead character doesn't have a voice or clear identity like in Dandelion. Sometimes I would have trouble distinguishing if she was having a thought/narration or actually talking and interacting with another character. I also just think giving her a voice gives her more character. Another gripe I have about the female lead is that it really isn't her fault that she's slow sometimes or a tool of the game's circumstances to move the plot or make a situation work. I understand that the female lead is intentionally vague oftentimes so that more players can relate to her, but in this case there actually wasn't much to relate to fundamentally...","February 18","true","59.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The others were literally crazy in aspects. I spent a good majority of the game thinking to myself "Oh crap, I'm gonna die." That's not really what I'm looking for in an otome. It also makes me a bit worried about this trend of normalizing/ok'ing abusive behavior.\nIn comparision to Dandelion in which there were some scary moments with some of the characters, I couldn't label any of them crazy or insane, and ended the game liking all of the characters. However, if creepy is your thing then you'll probably like most of the characters in Nameless.\n\nAnnoying dialogue. Does anyone really like being called "My Honey" that much?\n\nEndings. I get that the way each character arc ends wraps into the overarching story, but it would really nice to get more a closing for each character instead of such an open ending.  I also wasn't a fan of how they made it clear that there was only one character that the protagonist really supposed to end up with. It felt like that went against the whole  idea of having choices in an otome game.\n\nPros:\n\nGameplay: Cheritz up'd their game with this one. Overall it isn't nearly as repetative/borderline monotonous as Dandelion was. There also seems to be more potential endings for each character. The game isn't quite as interactive as Dandelion felt, and really felt more like a visual novel, focusing on the choices you make rather than buying affection as on option. This can be a pro or a con depending upon what you're looking for.\n\nGraphics: The graphics and CGI are beautiful! I wish there had been more CGI of these beautiful characters.\n\nContinutity: I really like that they brought over an aspect from Dandelion. I know some were not impressed by this, because if you've played Dandelion then you get the inkling off the bat of what may be going on. I personally was excited at the thought and was pleasantly surprised at the end to find out I was right.\n\nMusic: The music in this game is very pretty. I'm going to have to get the soundtrack at some point.\n\nCrobidoll: Crobidoll is a real company so you can actually get your own doll of the characters.","February 22","true","39.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/finn-fish/recommended/337930/","finn-fish","Finn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/finn-fish/","59 products in account","I so love Nameless. I really liked Dandelion too, but I don't really like stats-raising Otomes (like Dandelion), I'd rather play using Choices - like in Nameless, so I'm very happy to be able to play it. I also like the story and the characters. Does it sound too fangirl-y If i start rumbling about how I love everyone ?\n\nSo I'll begin with a short overview over the story. The Heroine - her start name is Eri, but you can change the name - lives alone in the house, which her late grandfather left her. Her Parents work overseas (or just far away) and she's always lived with her grandfather, till the day he died - a bit over one year. The only reason she doesn't feel alone are her dolls. Then One Day her five dolls turn into humans over night. So the Game is mainly about her life with these five - very good looking men/dolls - and her Relationship with them. After 3 Chapters (+Prologue) you will lock onto a Route. At first you can only choose between three of the guys (Lance, Yeonho and Yuri), but after the first playtrough you'll unlock Tei's Route and after that Red's.\n\nThe Menu of the Game consists not only of the usual Buttons (like start, continue etc) but has a big extra menu too. During the Game you will find diary pages of the Characters, wich you can then read (and are also read by the Voice Actors). You can also see all the CGs that you've unlocked, and all the Chapters + Endings (which you can view again). There's also a Section where the Characters tell you something, but it's not translated.\n\nThe Art looks utterly gorgeous, and the characters are interessting, funny - albeit sometimes eccentric. The Dialogue, as well as the story can be amusing (I just love the scenes when they're all together), but also serious/sad. Every Character (except of the Heroine (lol Red would like that one)) is voiced. And I really like the voices. I think they match the characters well. I also like the Character Design, as well as the UI. Altough I really hate, that the game always puts you on the first page of your saves - even If you saved/loaded the Game from a different Page. But I'm used to that now - Dandelion was the same.\n\nI can recommend this game to everybody who likes Otome. I'd say it's one of the best Otomes that I've played on Steam. It's really well made, and I've only seen a few spelling mistakes so far.\n\nI've finished the Game, and I have to say the story is both dramatic, funny and captivating. It's even better than I thought. The Routes themselves are connected, and after finishing the Game once, new Scenes were addded. It feels like a big Puzzle and with every finished Route it'll add a piece. I really like the story and how you'll find out more about each character, as you play all the routes. The Game has a great Cast of Characters. Not only the main Characters but also the secondary Characters are worth mentioning, which are also fully voiced. As for the Price, I think it's ok - it's totally worth it.","December 25, 2014","true","36.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

You could safely share all of your secrets with them. You could imagine their comforting voices when you cried. Within them, you could make the perfect friend.\n\nWhat if those toys came to life?\n\nCheritz's second game brings you into a beautifully drawn water-color world of love and possibilities as your character (Eri if you don't change her name) wakes up to find her five precious dolls have come to life. Each doll has their own personality, sometimes not as you may have imagined, and their own troubles and conflicts from not only on what it means for them to be a doll, but what it means to be human.\n\nNameless offers you many hours (25+) of gameplay and self-discovery as you journey through not only the boys' stories, but your own as well. The choices you make change the course of your story for better or for worse. Along the journey expect beautiful music scores that not only set the mood, but are great enough to just listen to on their own. To accompany the music, all characters (except yours) have wonderfully emotion filled voice overs for all dialogue.\n\nThis is not your average dating sim. This game means to not to merely tell you a story, but have you EXPERIENCE a story that everyone can relate to. You will feel a wide range of emotions and encounter your own memories as you play, so be ready to take a trip down memory lane.

Character driven stories are the best part of the gaming experience, and while the routes in Nameless are too dark to be my favourite dating game, it's still been worth every penny for other reasons.\n\nThe art is beautiful, and greatly improved from Dandelion. There are interesting side characters in addition to the date-able males, my favourite of which are the best friend duo Soi and Shibi. I loved it every time those two were on the screen. Female friendships are often left out of dating games to focus on the males, and this was a refreshing change. The main character Eri has a fleshed out personality, unlike some other eyeless MCs that are meant to be a stand-in for the player. In Nameless, the player is identified in some fourth-wall breaking.\n\nAs an owner of a ball-jointed doll there were definitely some moments I could relate to, like being nervous about taking the head cap off to change the doll's eyes, and talking to the dolls yet being too embarrassed to tell my IRL friends I own one. Cheritz really did their research in partnering with a real BJD company. The CG of the dolls on her shelf is perfect, they looked like real BJDs and not just a drawing.\n\nThe music, voice acting, and extras like the mini-games, Eri's diary, and her phone texts, all add to the atmosphere. There is a depth to Nameless that you don't get with Voltage or other pay-per-route otome games.\n\nMy only criticism is that the dialogue options feel random, and don't necessarily reflect what the male needs to hear directly. How did I get Lance's bad ending when choosing between "I'm fine" and "stand up to look at him"? That's way too generic when I wanted to say "I won't abandon you" to reassure him. I went back to choose again and the dialogue immediatly afterwards did not change. There should be a direct indication you chose correctly, like the bomb animation in Sweet Fuse or the flower animation in Hakkouki.\n\nThis game has one surprise after another, and I fully recommend it to anyone who enjoys visual novels. I fell in love with each character, and my wish is that I could all of them the happiest dolls together. Bringing a dating game to the English market is a risky move, and I'm so glad to have the opportunity to play Nameless.\n\nChertiz interacts with the fans, and has answered my questions directly, and posts new art sometimes on Facebook. More new art for Dandelion too, please! I can't get enough. I love the gifts they sent after purchasing, and I still have the notebook on my desk.

I bought it because I like text-heavy games, anime, and dolls.  Like most games of this type, there isn't much gameplay other than reading text and making extremely occasional choices to make the story go in a different direction.  The choices you make determine which guy the main character, Eri, decides to get together with.  Without spoiling too much, it's about the emotional issues that dolls might have if they were alive.  Yeah.  If you're creeped out by dolls, you probably don't want to play this.\n\nI've finished two endings so far.  The first time I played I just picked the choices that I would normally pick and I'm guessing I got the "you failed" ending because it came up really quickly, there wasn't anything romantic, and it didn't make any sense.  The second time I got the ending where you get together with Yeonho, which was rather sweet and a bit sad as well.  It seems that there is a "deeper layer" to the story based on the weirdness of the bad ending, the question about the name of your first doll/memories about the doll in the closet, the weird dialogue on the black screens, etc., but I haven't figured out what it is yet.  I'll probably play all the routes just to see what the explanation for all that is.\n\nOne of the things that stood out to me about Nameless is that it's really polished (besides a few spelling errors, but I'm guessing there aren't as many in the original Korean version).  The art and the music is well done, and everybody besides Eri is voice-acted in Korean.  Even random characters like classmates who have like one line, and Eri's parents who you meet for five minutes.  The intro and ending animations were really cool to see since the rest of the game is not really animated.  Things like the diaries and the phone were nice touches.  One of the best features is a "skip" option that, when replaying for a different ending, lets you skip past dialogue you've read already really quickly.\n\nOf course, in a game like this, the most important thing is the writing and characterization.  It's pretty good, from what I've played so far.  The translation feels natural-- there was definitely a lot of work put into localizing it in a way that makes sense to English speakers, rather than just a straight translation (which can be stiff sometimes).  The guys in the "dating pool" all have distinct personalities, and so does Eri.  I especially liked the characterization of the Eri's two best friends.  The bits of mystery scattered throughout are subtle enough not to be annoying, and do their job of making me want to replay the game.\n\nThere were only a few things that bothered me about the game.  Clicking twice with my trackpad causes the game to minimize-- luckily it doesn't happen with my mouse.  You can't hit spacebar or any other keyboard key to advance the text.  Also, this isn't a real complaint, but I couldn't help but wonder why nobody at the school thinks it's weird that these guys look just like and have the same names as these dolls (especially Lance, who's apparently the most popular model and is mass produced)?  I mean, there has to be at least one other Crobidoll fan at Eri's school.\n\nAll in all, this is a good game with an interesting story, and a great first dating sim to try.","January 3, 2015","true","18.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The english translation definitely improved since Dandelion, but there are couple of types here and there and there was only one sentence that didn't really make sense.\nI personally hate stat-raising visual novel games, so I was all over this game when I found out about it.\nThe game is fairly lengthy for around $30, so I do feel like you are getting more from what you pay.\nThe characters themselves are fairly well-written and while I did have my favorites, I didn't really dislike any of them. But the ones really stood out for me where the main character's best friends, Soi and Shinbi. I was SOOOO happy that there were such supportive and good friends to the main character and I felt like in a lot of otome games, there doesn't seem any female friends as they are usually seen as competitors with the main character. Compared to Japanese games, Korean games are much more difficult to get outside of the country and usually games for smart phones aren't that great, so I avoided those like the plague.\nI do wish that there was some tutorial as to which buttons to press to excess the menu and such.\n\n\nP.S. If you want to skip the opening and ending music videos in the game, just press RIGHT-CLICK to skip it. Oh, and you can find some of the characters' diaries by playing other characters' routes.\n\n\nEDIT: Okay I just noticed that there are some difference between the korean and english versions. I mostly played in English since it would take me longer to finish in Korean, but I noticed that if you have it in English, the characters won't say some of the lines that goes with the translation. I'm not sure why they took some of the lines out for the characters even though they bothered to translate those lines, so this is a little disappointing. WHich makes me wonder if they took some lines out for Dandelion too.","January 3, 2015","true","29.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As you unlock more characters, fall in love with the different boys, and find the right path to choose, there's a bigger story about love and abandonment playing in the background, gradually getting more and more prominent as you play the different paths.\nIt's an interesting take on the usual Otome Game narrative - when we usually pick one path of the guy who will be our favorite, getting his happy ending, then quickly forgetting him in order to play a different path - after all we to get 100% completion to unlock the secret "true" ending so many of these games have. Nameless, like it's predecessor Dandelion, shoves the idea of that in your face, using it to tell a masterful story.\nGameplay is different than Dandelion. Instead of stat raising, you just read and pick certain path choices. I personally enjoy the challenge of Stat Raising versions of Otome Games, but Nameless had such good story and gripping writing I was never bored with the wall of text I was faced with.\nI didn't connect with the boys as much as I did in Dandelion, personally I felt the majority of them were too possessive, however the game does a good job weaving dark story plots in with the light hearted "My dolls became real!" narrative and the boys insecurities and phobias become relatable through the writing.\nCheritz is a wonderful company doing wonderful things and if you want to support the Otome/Visual Novel industry making it's way to English speaking markets, these are MUST HAVE games.","January 5, 2015","true","22.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Do you happen to be an avid collector of ball-jointed dolls? Do you want to never look at dolls the same way again? If yes, then Nameless ~The one thing you must recall~ may be the game for you.\n\nThere is an overall plot throughout the game which does a wonderful job tying all the routes together. As you complete routes, Eri is fleshed out more and you slowly find the answers to the mysteries surrounding the game. Unlike Dandelion's stat-raising mechanics, Nameless does away with that in favor of a traditional visual novel format with two mandatory mini-games per route (True/False segment & Memory Cards).\n\nNot going to be able to list everything due to character limits, but...\n\nParts I liked:\n* Voice acting. Not familiar with the Korean language, but I felt you could get a good sense of the cast's personalities and emotions through the voices. Also, I enjoyed Soi's voice actress whom I felt did a wonderful job bringing out the best out of Soi's quirky, outgoing character; her voice was one of the reasons I loved Soi when playing the game.\n* Art. Though some of it were some awkward parts (e.g. Yuri's long neck in the CG of the dolls first appearing as human) was beautifully colored and the sprites did well portraying the characters. The artist did a good job adapting Crobidoll's characters into the game.\n* Nameless/???. For someone behind entire the plot and acting as an antagonist, I feel the writers did a great job with him. He did a lot of things that sometimes makes you want to scream "STOP" (e.g. Ripping out parts of Eri's memories, etc), but at the same time, you could almost feel sympathy for him. If you have fond memories for the toys you had when you were little, then you may almost tear up when you learn more about Nameless/???'s story in the secret character routes. Also, like Soi, I felt his voice actor did a wonderful job bringing out the creepiness within him.\n* Eri and the dolls' issues. The game touches on various themes such as abandonment, self-worth, identity, how one presents themselves to society vs their true character and hobbies, etc. throughout the story as it explores the characters of the love interests and Eri herself. Eri and each guy have an issue either dealing with abandonment by their loved ones (Yeonho, Tei, Nameless/???), their own sense of identity and self-worth (Lance, Red), loneliness (Eri, Nameless/???), love (Yuri), and various other issues which the game does a wonderful job presenting to the players. Each character has developed their own attitudes and personas in order to deal with their inner conflicts, but as you dig deeper into their routes, you slowly learn not everything is as it seems it is.\n\nParts I feel could be improved on:\n* Though this is common practice for VN protagonists, I was disappointed Eri didn't get her own voice actress unlike Dandelion's protagonist, Heejung Kim. In Dandelion, I felt the player could better sense Heejung's conflict with dealing the high expectations of her mother and during critical plot moments when you heard her speak. In Nameless, I had a much more difficult time being able to relate to Eri because of her lack of voice. Also, I noticed Eri's face/body in most CGs was either obscured or out of focus unlike the guys. Again common practice, but still disappointing since I liked how Heejung had a visible face and presence just as much as the guys in CGs in Dandelion.\n* Editing. I feel the editing job could use more work. There are a lot of noticeable typos especially in diary entries, and also awkward phrasing (e.g. Spirits and Mystery Club & Discipline Guide vs Occult Club & Disciplinary Committee Member). Also, I've noticed that stuttering has been translated with commas instead of dashes (e.g. Wha, What vs Wha-What), which looks out-of-place. The translation is actually pretty decent for something done in-house, however.\n* I feel the guys' popularity is too overblown and doesn't do much to serve the story. Also, the fact that Eri gets bullied in certain routes, especially Red's, for being associated with the guys doesn't serve the story much beyond the need for convenient drama and reenforcing the negative stereotype of women being so single-minded for men that someone so much as saying hi to their crush becomes an enemy in their eyes.\n* Handling of the more unstable characters' issues. The game does a wonderful setting up characters such as Yeonho and Tei as unhinged, but does a poor job handling them in the endings. You've got Yeonho who reveals himself to be obsessed with Eri as he bombards her with texts, clings onto her to the point of ignoring everyone else to be with her, sets up plans to make her come back to him and even going as far as to attempt to strangle her to be "together forever" with her in one bad ending due to his abandonment issues. Then you've got Tei who has bouts of insanity that he tries to keep under control and is involved in many of the game's bad endings. However, despite the great set up, these behaviors magically go away in the good ending of their routes. In real life, these sort behaviors Yeonho and Tei display and the issues associated with them normally take years to change and cope with provided they get professional help. I'm fine with emotionally unstable love interests in unhealthy relationships. Hell, I'm fine if the good end is them admitting they have issues and taking the first step to change, but it's not even that. The minute they hook up with Eri, whatever emotional instability they displayed before just... disappears as if those issues were never there before.\n\nDespite the wordiness of my criticism for Nameless (and when I like something, I get wordy about what I feel could be improved on), I definitely do recommend getting the game since the overall story is definitely worth it.\n\nAnd a final note: For a professionally done & fully voiced game, I feel it was right for Cheritz to price it $32.99. If you're still unsure if the game is worth it, I recommend trying out the demo available on Steam or on Chertiz's site[nl.cheritz.com] before buying.","January 5, 2015","true","44.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This otome plays up all those fears and more. Will you have your happy ending?\n\nStory:\nYou are Eri, a BJD collector who happens to have her dolls become human by magic. Your story will be about creating memories and understanding who and what your now-human dolls are as you go to school with them. Will they be your hero? Or your prince? You will fall in love with one of those dolls and have your happy ending.\n\nOr you happen to end up with the bad ending and have the heebie-jeebies for the next few weeks.\n\nWARNING: Story will contain possessiveness to yandere-style love.\n\nGameplay:\n5 characters plus a Secret (lol) character means you will have lots and lots of storytime to go through since this game is pure Visual Novel (VN) with no stat-raising at all.\n\nThat being said, there are two mini games (quiz and memory cards) which tie nicely to the plot. While I love the zero stat-raising, I love the added mini-games which tie to the plot even more!\n\nThe game is divided into 3 'gem' type of routes. Only Lance, YeonHo and Yuri have a Common Route while Tei and Red do not. You have to finish Tei's route to get to Red's route but the trio (Lance, YeonHo, Yuri) can be played by any order.\n\nI recommend that you play Yuri first. Followed by Lance, then YeonHo, Tei and Red. This order creates a marvelous linear storyline.\n\nWriting:\nThe writing is strong. The main concept and underlying plotline of memories (much like Dandelion) is well executed. You will not get tired of the story even with the multiple playthroughs you have to do for Yuri, YeonHo and Lance.\n\nThe interaction between characters really do show their personality. I for one was able to relate to Eri easily as she REALLY reacts like a typical teenage girl. That being said, her friends, Soi and Shinbi and other side-characters were given a good dose of character that is believable.\n\nThe way the story was written and that ending twist shows me how strong their storytelling are.\n\nArt:\nAll the art were pastel coloured with that deep purple coloured UI as a foil really made everything pop to me. The care and effort that went into the art really showed! Though some CGs still suffer from the funny angles they are in, overall they have created a world which BJDs really did come alive. Thank you, Cheritz!\n\nEverything was drawn except for Banjul's background which was an edited picture. Dunno why they chose to use an edited picture but I'm sure they had their reasons.\n\nMusic:\nThe music is soothing and yet haunting at the same time. It suits the art to a T. I love how it changes to create the desired atmosphere at the correct times in the game. I REALLY, really want their OST.\n\nVoice Acting:\nI LOVE THEIR VOICE-ACTING! It is refreshing to hear Korean voices in an otome instead of the usual Japanese. The emotions and personality really came through in the voice acting. My favourite was Yujin, believe it or not. Probably because his obsession for Beatrice really sounds believeable.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nThereis so much that I enjoy about this game and there is so little I could put it in words. The themes of loneliness, abandonment, self-discovery, confidence and many more makes this game a visual novel that is on par if not better than most visual novels I have played before. Though it being a Cheritz game do not expect it to be all sunshine and roses for the happy end. Seriously.\n\nThe price may sound steep to a first time buyer but I assure you, it is all worth it!\n\nPrepare your tissues and chocolates and comforting thing and dive into this game. There's a lot going for it and my review cannot do it justice.\n\n4.9/5.0","January 2, 2015","true","3.8"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","2"

The characters looked odd in some of them and there wasn't a great sense of accomplishment in unlocking them. Some bad ends felt forced and out-of-character.\n*I recommend this game purely because I thought the story was good but I honestly feel gypped by the lack of nice CGs. This game is also a lot darker than Dandelion so proceed with caution if you are buying Nameless because you enjoyed Dandelion.\n\nFULL REVIEW:\nSince this is a visual novel rather than a game, it is definitely not for everyone. Having been a fan of Dandelion (the company's first game) I bought this one full of expectations. Compared to Dandelion, Nameless was a lot darker and much more drama-filled. There are many twists and turns in the story and bad ends strike when you least expect. Though bad ends do make for interesting stories, a few of the bad ends in Nameless felt forced. Drama for the sake of drama and completely out of character. In fact, one character who shall not be named has so many bad ends (~8-10?) that his good end felt out of character for me.\n\nI felt fairly disappointed at the CGs. There was a lot of potential in the story to have interesting scenes but for some reason, the majority were fairly ordinary and not very noteworthy. When characters have outfit changes, rather than illustrate it, we are just left with no picture while the dialogue is still going.\n\nAside from these cons, the story was really well written and woven so that all the characters' stories combined to tell a whole story. The characters were well fleshed out and each one had their own distinct personality that really shined through.\n\nIn summary, this game is good for those who enjoy a really well written dark drama. For those who are more like me and prefer light hearted with cute moments this game is definitely not for you.","December 31, 2014","true","20.8"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Well my friend, you can put your fears to rest. Nameless is different enough in gameplay, art style and character to make the game new and exciting but with all the humour and developed plot that made us love Dandelion. If you haven't played Dandelion it doesn't matter, this game is beautiful regardless!\n\nThis game is more obviously in a visual novel format, so far I haven't seen any of the stat changing/ affection raising bars that you might normally expect in a dating sim. It's quite nice though because the story is written in a way that you don't really mind the lack of autonomy in where you go/ what you do. It makes the relationships you form in the game feel more natural and fluid, as sometimes the decisions you get to make aren't obviously leading towards any specific character. It's less superficial than stalking the one you think is the prettiest and doing whatever actions you know will get their heartscore up. Don't get me wrong there are those obvious decisions too, but it's nice to get a mix! Every so often theres a lil' game thrown in there too, just to spice up the VN feel.\n\nI think what I love most about this game though is that it genuinely makes me laugh due to it's content, not because of any mistakes or bugs. The script is witty and has translated well (John the cat is a beautiful example of this ;D) which is important for a game that focuses on a visual novel format. The characters are wonderful too, I don't really play many dating sims and I feared that they would be too similar to the character types in Dandelion. Admittedly they do adhere to a few stereotypes of the personality they are given (the small one is cute, likes sweet things, is adoring etc.)  but I think that the creators have injected enough variation that they aren't just the stereotype, they have a few more facets to their personality.\n\nI've really been enjoying this game, just as much, if not more, than Dandelion. And I played Dandelion A LOT. I would definitely recommend Nameless to anyone on the fence about spending their hard earned cash!\n\n(Also, if you end up loving Nameless you should totally go play Dandelion. Serious.

The MC has realistic reactions to the sudden changes in her life instead of just instantly accepting them, which works very well for making the stories more believable.

This game is full of deeply written main characters whose motivations and pasts almost made me cry, and is also full of very interesting 'secondary' characters that you can easily fall in love with, including the MC's best friends.\n\nThere is no stat raising in this game! So the one issue I had with their previous game is now solved! With that, I have no real issues with Nameless.

I just finished all the paths in Dandelion, so this was a nice after Christmas surprise. I thought I was going to have to wait much longer for this one to pop up on Steam ^_^\n\nThough not a cheap VN, the amount of time you'll spend on it and how much story is available (and the fact that there are so many voice actors) is worth it in my opinon. The artwork is lovely and the soundtrack is very nice. Though be prepared, the main character is NOT voiced like Heejung was in Dandelion. A silent MC...\n\nOverall I love Cheritz stories, and that's what I'm here for. I *am* a bit disappointed that I can't use my spacebar to move the dialogue along like I could in Dandelion, but instead actually have to click. I'm lazy like that lol. I'm just used to using the spacebar in my VN's, so it's a bit different, but I'll get used to it (though you CAN use the Enter key). And I was also a bit thrown off because of the save feature in Dandelion being the ESC key, and was a bit confused at first that it wasn't the same for Nameless. After some digging (and I'm sure people who are smarter than me already figured this out on their own) you use the right mouse button to open up the Save/Load screen in game.\n\nI'm excited to play through all these new paths and storylines though. And I hear that for this one, the boys will still be a part of the story and not so off to the side like they had to be in Dandelion. So far it's a beautiful Prologue and I'm very excited to see where their stories will take me :)\n\nAs with all translations, there are a few mistakes here and there, but nothing that is worth brushing off the entire VN. I get that this is pricy for some people though. So if it's your first "major" VN, I would recommend choosing something else (like Dandelion). But you will get your money's worth because of the amount of time you can spend playing it (over 40 hours with all paths and endings and bonus content). So if it's not an immediate buy, it's still worth adding to your Wishlist and saving up for.\n\nI'm only adding in my personal opinions since most of the reviews so far explain the actual great qualities of the VN better, so read up on those too!\n\nI give it a 9/10 and definitely a story worth adding to your collection if you're either a Dandelion/Cheritz fan or someone who enjoys a great VN. And if you're still on the fence, check out the other reviews, look around the store page, do some searches online and whatnot :)","December 27, 2014","true","43.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The MC had this personality that just resonated at times with the player. Her reactions were very realistic, given the situation, and was such a pleasant surprise for me.\n\nThe best part of this game was that the characters, both main and supporting, expressed such detail in their personalities that you could easily picture their reactions when doing this and that which made the whole experience fun and enjoyable.\n\nSo otome gamers, especially first timers, this one's for you ;)","December 27, 2014","true","34.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

As the previous game Dandelion, it's a pleasure to listen to korean language.

Here you do not have to make skills by activity, in this game you just have to choose your answer. There is fanservice...\n\nMy favorite routes are Lance and Tei (this caracter is really interesting ^^).\nMy favorite character and voice actor are Lance. It would be great that there were a story after the secret endings which you can confirm the ending with the character you prefer.\n\nI recommend it. The game is expensive but, you will not regret it.\n\n------\n\nCe jeu est génial. La langue coréenne est tellement belle et, les doubleurs sont excellents. Ce jeu, comme le précédent Dandelion est très bien travaillé et étudié. C'est très artistique (musique, dessins, histoire, voix, personnages).\n\nLe jeu par rapport à Dandelion est différent. Ici, c'est plus de la visual novel. Vous n'avez pas à faire des activités pour gagner des points de compétence à répartir puis des choix à faire. Ici, l'histoire se déroule et vous avez le choix de répondre à des questions de temps en temps, qui définissent la suite de l'histoire. Il y a du fanservice....\n\nJe trouve que Lance et Tei sont les personnages les plus intéressants.\nMon personnage préféré et mon doubleur préféré sont ceux de Lance.\nJe trouve dommage qu'il n'y est pas une "vraie" fin confirmant le personnage préféré après la 2ème secret ending.\n\nLes jeux Cheriz sont chers, mais, vous ne le regretterez pas :)","December 29, 2014","true","51.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Crobidoll BJD collectors can see some familiar dolls "come to life" in-game, personality and all, while visual novel fans can purchase their very own doll versions of the characters in real life. It's a unique intermingling of two seemingly different communities, and it's fantastic.\n\nThe game features beautiful graphics and a talented voice cast, but what truly elevates this game are its characters. Each main character's story is masterfully written and provide depth to each character's personality, motives, inhibitions, and relationships with others in the cast. Even minor characters are unique and memorable.\n\nThose who have played Cheritz's previous otome game, Dandelion ~Wishes brought to you~, may be surprised to discover that Nameless retains only the visual novel elements and does away with stat-based gameplay. This allows for much more focus on story progression and character development which, evidently, plays to Cheritz's strong points and results in a solid otome game. Additionally, the pacing is much smoother and more even in Nameless, thanks to the early character introductions and purely visual novel format.\n\nOverall, Nameless ~The one thing you must recall~ is a remarkable visual novel experience and is well worth checking out.","January 1, 2015","true","0.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The writing, and especially the dialogue, was unique and stuck very well to each character and did an amazing job at forming a heart-wrenching story. Don't even get me started on the story, my goodness. Quite literally, I couldn't shut up for days after finishing this game. And the characters...!! Each boy's route is unique in its own way, touching up on different problems that can be easily relatable, making each character feel much more alive and much more real. It wasn't just the main boys and the MC, but the supportive characters as well. Every single character had lots of thought put into them. The opening and endings songs blew me away, especially considering they were sung BY the voice actors themselves (the majority of the songs, anyway)! My only wish is that the songs were available to own!

For example, you have to play certain character before others. However, that is understandable because it makes the story flow a lot better. And, unlike Dandelion, the MC is not voiced.

Eventually I decided to give it a go and I'm so glad I did. Unlike it's predecessor there is no stat raising in this  otome at all which was a huge relief to me. Simular to the previus game, it can get a little dark for some of the bad endings but it's such a rare expereience in these games that I actively seeked out each and every end. I really enjoyed how this game was tied in with the previous as I really do like Wizard's character. Each boy has a real-life problem that you have to help them overcome and as you do so, you become closer. I really enjoyed seeing these and how the slightest thing could offset the balance. As you unlock more of the boys routes to play through, the story does change so you aren't playing the same thing over and over so the reply value is pretty good. After completeing everything I invested nearly 50 hours into this game and it was well worth it. A great experience. There is however, some problems with the grammer and spelling here and there which can ruin the mood so do be careful of that if you are like me!

The protagonist of  Nameless  can skip this question as she has the chance to talk with their dolls brought to life. Which brings not only joy into her life, but sorrow as well. Because nothing is the way it seems at first.\nThe protagonist of the game, Eri (the name can be changed, if player wishes so), finds herself in a rather confusing situation. Her life is turned upside down when the dolls she loves so much come to life and become a major part of her own. Depending on the chosen route, Eri has the chance to get to know one of her living dolls better, which lets the player unlock new routes and extra content. Are the dolls acting the way she imagined them to? What brought them to life in the first place? What is the true heart of each of the dolls? The answers are waiting in the story.\nNameless  is an otome game, so you can expect a lot of romantic and sweet moments, but the more you read, the more you unveil a darker side of the story which can send a cold chill down your spine.\nThe game is filled with beautiful music, magnificent art and a story which can be fully understood after finishing all the possible routes. The voice acting is great and voices fit characters perfectly, giving them even more charm. This game is a lot like a book in which you can choose your path and it has a few mini-games during the story. If you want to have a nice, relaxing and emotional time with a game, then I recommend this story to you.\nI had the chance to play this game when it was released and it is great to know that it is now available on Steam as well.

The second I had watched the trailer I needed the game but I couldn't get it right away. Sadly I am on the poor side :). Anyways I really loved their routes I would say Tei was my favorite out of the few. You see I have a thing for people who are borderline crazy Like Tei and yeonho. Tei was probably more my favorite then yeonho because Tei looks older...Sorry Yeon-ho but i wasn't that attracted to your looks ((i was more attracted to his back story)). The voice actors were amazing Tei i could really feel the heart though. I liked that about him. I find it funny that lance was not my favorite character. Dont get me wrong I loved him too. He just wasn't as crazy as everyone else It would have been awesome if he was. Anyway I highly recommend getting this game I legit screamed when it was downloading. All the characters have different crazy and fun personality. Even your friends soi and shinbi. I cried in lances route when shes like.

I swear.\nAnyway, if you've never played an otome before, I strongly recommend this one. It's got some pretty solid characters and an intersting storyline to follow, though it may be confusing at times.\nThere's alot to take in with this game, most of the character's routes feel fleshed out, and since it's entirely visual novel based, it's quite a read. The music and the sprites are gorgeous and the atmosphere really does suck you in. The Voice acting is a lovely touch and each character was well voiced and boiling with emotion. I even liked that each of them greets you on the main screen, it would always make my heart sing~\nIf I had any complaints it would be about length. While I do like long stories, some routes seemed to drag on in places and I would get bored in the middle and find myself abandoning the game for a while, but I'd always ome back for more. The typos are far and few but they are there, mostly in the diary entries. I felt as though some of the CG's looked a bit too different from the character's sprites (espcially Yuri and Tei?) as if the artist couldn't slim them down properly, but regardless, most of the art work is phenomonal.\nAll in all, I really did enjoy this game. Some parts were fairly creepy and some were kind of... adult so I would recomend this to someone at least older than 14...\nIf you want to try a dating sim, or a visual novel this is a great start, but if youre a veteran of the genre it's a must have for your library.

This game is filled with plot twists that you don't expect, beautiful artwork, passionate voice acting, in-depth dialogue, and amazing character development.  If you have played through Cheritz's previous game, Dandelion Wishes Brought to You, then you also had to deal with the whole "bring up the love points until they're human"-bit and while it's fun the first time, it gets old quickly when all you want to do is get to the individual character's story.  Well, that is no longer an issue as you only have to play through the prologue for three out of five of the characters and even though that may still seem tedious, it changes each time and you are given the option to skip through the parts that you have been previously exposed to, so no worries for those of you who are as impatient as me!  Similar to Dandelion, there is a secret character's story that intertwines with each of the main guys' stories...and it gets intense!  When you finally get through every one of the main character's stories, the anticipation you feel will be so incredible that by the time you actually get to playing through that part of the story, your eyes will be glued to the computer screen in suspense!\n\nTo briefly summarize the actual background behind this game, main character (player) Eri collects dolls and one day, they come to life.  The first thing that came to mind when I learned of this was that that's actually kind of terrifying (dolls freak me out ^^0).  However, if you put yourself Eri's shoes, you'll realize that this is actually a dream come true for her due to her feelings of extreme loneliness ever since her grandfather passed away.  From the moment that she made each one's purchase, she fell in love with them even if they were simply inanimate objects.  Now it is the player's choice to go with one of the dolls Yeonho, Lance, or Yuri at first and later Tei or Red.  Each character has it's own charm, although my personal favorite was Lance ^^.  When the player encounters all of the boys at the beginning and learns about their personalities, the first impression that the player may get is that these are just your run-of-the-mill, stereotypical otome game guys.  The silent type, the flirty playboy, the cutesy shota boy, the kind and sweet boy, and lastly the innocent/happy-go-lucky boy.  However, the player soon learns that each one is so much more detailed than the orignal first impression that they were given.  Honestly, one of the things that I like most about this game is that all of the characters are so complex, it's so interesting to learn about each one that you just want to keep playing.  Not only are the characters of the boys so interesting, but the art for them is so beautiful that you may even find yourself getting caught up in the beauty of the character's appearance.  The CGs that you get when you pick correct choices are stunning, so much so that I'm sure that we as players are not even able to grasp just how much work and care was put into each individual drawing.  The artwork truly enhances the overall experience of the gameplay just as much as the interesting dialogue and overall story keep you wanting more.  Another enhancer to the game was the voice acting and I can personally tell you that it was amazing because you just want to take your time and listen to the voice actors speak each line.  There is so much passion and emotion within their voices, giving the game a new dimension and making it really come to life.\n\nThis game had me laughing outloud, smiling weirdly to myself, making me want to punch a pillow (the bullies >n<), and cry for over an hour.  While all of that may seem a bit exaggerated, trust me when I say that I'm not overdramatizing the emotions I felt when playing this game (espeically when it came to the secret character's story *cries*).  I absolutley adored this game to no end.  Thanks to all of the beautiful artwork, intriguing dialogue, amazing plot-devlopment, and passionate voice acting, this game is easily one of the best otome games I've played in a long time.  Would I recommend this game?  Yes yes and yes.  I have already recommended it to friends who like otome games and will continue to bother them until they buy it >:3.  Was it worth the full price of $33?  Yes, it is worth that and more, without a doubt.  If you read this review and are having mixed feelings about buying this game, you should definitely do it because I will never be able to truly express to you through a simple review just how much I adored this game and you will only really be able to understand it if you play it for yourself!","January 12, 2015","true","30.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game will make a tiny bit more sense if you have played Dandelion, but it doesn't effect it that much. Now if you are wondering why I previously said it was an emotional rollercoaster, you'll see in the first route regardless if you pick Yuri, Lance, or Yeonho. As I said all characters are extremely likable and have hidden parts to their personalities such as insecurity that you just wouldn't expect it from. Now if you look at a character and are like "I hate them already" it honestly won't last long if you go through their route. The art is beautiful and it is full voiced in Korean and it has some parts that mix with Dandelion, the game is enjoyable and the ending scenes are sung by your character's love interest that you chose to go after. If you hated the stat raising in Dandelion, this doesn't have that, if you loved the characters in Dandelion all these characters are like mixes of the ones in there, though Yuri is most like Jisoo. The characters all have personality and indivisuality that you probably won't see coming.","January 13, 2015","true","68.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is my 2nd game from the company and it's closer to a pure VN vs stat-raiser kind of game like Dandelion. I admit I bought this before the former one out of curiosity since the doll theme appealed to me more at the time. IIRC you can go in any route order but a few of the characters are only unlocked if you clear the game 1-3x and not before. Art is nice and reminds me of water colors along w/CGs. VA is very good too for the different scenes.  Story can be a bit confusing but makes more sense after you clear the game and gain info. Side characters are well-deveoped and have their own personalities/goals. UI is clean and functions well based off Ren'Ai and I can read the text w/o any problems.\n\nIf you're a fan of otoge or VN-style games I think you'll like Cheritz's games.

Nameless: The one thing you must recall, I should be remembering about this game\n…\n…\n…\nOh! Right! This is the Crobi doll game. XD\n\n\nSome backstory, I first found about Crobi when I entered a charity raffle at Anime North a few years ago. I ended up winning a Lance doll in the charity raffle. I went to the website and saw my lance didn’t look like any of them on the site. I found out that the doll had been given away at an event. I have to admit I like mine with his eyes open better. I found on the website that they were making a visual novel based on the dolls but I never seen the site update about the game so I forgot about it until I saw it on steam. I must admit I am not the kind of person who plays these kind of games, so take anything I am about to say with that knowledge in mind.\n\nOnto the game itself,\n\nIf people are unaware of what a visual novel is then allow me to tell you it’s more of reading a book then playing a game. Get ready to click the mouse for 99% of the game. The two little mini games are two far and in-between to really break up the continual clicking. This brings me to a little thing about the quiz game that I feel might be a culture difference from Korea. You must answer questions and you have a O for true and an X for no but when you hover over them the O is red and the X is blue. This could make you think that X is true O is false.  There are little problems with the translation, spelling errors, slight programing mishaps when suddenly names are not translated or the main characters name being replaced with %. There could have been more polish to the translation especially when something is trying to be funny like shouldn’t Johnson be Willy?\n\nIn this game there are “routes” or parts of the story that focus on each of the boys with two final parts that bring everything together. This gives the game some sort of replay value but on each route you will find a lot of things repeating. Like how many times the main character’s friend has to put twitter on main character’s phone in a slightly different way with you getting no new information out of it.\n\nI find the story to be well done but not without faults. It made me laugh a few times and cried a bit on the final ending but some points I was struggling to pay attention. If I had to but the story simply I would have to say it was a 20 hour darker bits of Toy Story game. I found myself wanting the story to be darker to keep my attention.  Don’t take it like this will be a gore fest. Lance seems to get the most realistically fleshed out. Owners bias maybe. We have the three different stopping playing with you toys is abuse stories that are all slightly different but it adds to themes repeating.  The ending seems incomplete as I find it didn’t give us any look into the consequences of the ending. I must admit things like this, Toy Story and The Brave Little Toaster is why I cannot throw anything away.\n\nThe character art in the game is absolutely gorgeous that I would like them to be my desktops but some of the backgrounds just look off. The soft character art style sometime clashes with the harder art of the backgrounds it can be distracting. The art matches the characters well but there is colour coded personalities at work here. You can understand their personalities and their problems just by looking at them. I really didn’t find any surprises but at least I got lances personality down perfectly just by looking at his doll, so take from that what you will.\n\nIn conclusion, in no way do I find this a bad visual novel; if you like this fall in love with the boy and fix the problems kind of story you will like this. If you like that and are a fan of Toy Story you will like it but it’s not my kind of story. I like to congratulate the writers for making me care about the side characters and making the main character more than a plank of wood that never does anything and waits for everyone else do save them. I like how only a few times it peeked though that this was an advertisement for Crobi dolls and some other café. I am disappointed that there isn’t a route for Sinbi; regardless of the fact she’s female. Overall not a bad visual novel but considering the price I would have waited for the sale if I didn’t own Lance and wasn’t a general fan of Crobi dolls. If this review ever does get back to Crobi I just like to thank them for their support if Doll North and I hope they continue to do so as I wouldn’t have got my Lance any other way.\n","January 17, 2015","true","30.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I ended up doing nothing but playing that game for the next few days, this is the second game from the same company so when it finally got greenlit I bought it instantly. I haven't finished all routes but so far I'm really enjoying this game. If you've played Dandelion - Wishes brought to you - then you will most likely enjoy this game as well. The characters are lovable and the story is interesting. The price might look expensive for a visual novel/otome game but you get what you pay for. This is the second game from this company yet it's so well done. But enough talk let's just dive right into my pros and cons.\n\nPros\n- A MC with her own personality and friends outside of the "boys", this makes her seem more believable and fleshed out as a character.\n- Lovely side characters, they have fleshed out personalities and are interesting in their own way\n- Lovely Art\n- Sounds, the music is good and there's sound effects for things going on in the story to help flesh out what's going on around you.\n- Great Voice Acting, I love the voices although they are in Korean. If you don't like this you can turn them off, you can also choose to just disable a certain persons voices in the settings if you only dislike that one voice.\n- They got rid of the stat system from Dandelion, so unlike Dandelion there's no time in the game where you will just go around clicking random objects without progressing the story at all. While this might make it feel like less of a game and more of a visual novel it  really helps the flow of the story imo.\n- Different endings, each character have different endings that you can unlock. One happy ending and a few bad ones.\n- And last but not least, an interesting story. The story itself ties together through all the different routes you play. This keeps the game interesting. Each character also have their own story so it feels fresh when you play a new route and the overlapping story makes you want to play them all.\n\nNeutral things (cons to some and pros to others)\n- The MC is not voiced in this game unlike Dandelion, I personally liked the silent MC but I can see some that might have wished for a voice option.\n- Can have a bit of a slow start where you only click through text, don't worry you'll get plenty of opportunities to make choices as the prologue is over.\n\nCons\n- There's a few translation errors or typos, I can't say I've seen that many but there's a couple in there. The ones I did see didn't bother me personally since I understood what they meant and they were few and far between, so it's not a big deal.\n- No lip movement when talking, Dandelion had this but this game don't. That's something I personally missed.\n\nThe game might no be perfect but it's a good game, each character have their own worries and problems and acts human. It's a very good Otome game and if you enjoy these kind of games then you will most likely enjoy Nameless as well and if you like Nameless don't forget to check out their older title called Dandelion which is also available on Steam.","January 17, 2015","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was a big fan of Dandelion and had great expectations for Nameless. Overall, it is a fun game for those that enjoy otome games. Although I believe the story could have been written better for later routes, the voice acting was superb, the soundtrack was great, and the characters are likeable.\n\nHowever, after replaying a route, I can say I'm disappointed that the typos and coding mistakes were not corrected before being released on Steam.","January 17, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because of all the various routes, each having multiple endings, one can easily spend 30+ hours completing the game.\n\nAnd of course the artwork is superb, which is to be expected based on previous games released by this developer.\n\nAlso, though the price may seem high, the high quality artwork and story (with the voice acting being an added bonus) make it money well spent in my opinion.","January 17, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nameless takes place before the events of Dandelion, and is by comparison, darker and more serious. Given how intense Dandelion can get, that's really saying something.\n\nSo far, I've only finished one path completely, but I have to say I really enjoyed it. The art, music, and voice acting are all top-notch. The translation is a little awkward in places, with frequent typos, which I found extremely distracting. The fact that the game ties in with real-world locations and companies was kind of cool - knowing that I could own the same dolls that are in the game or get a cup of coffee at Banjul gave the story a greater feeling of depth and realism. The characters are engaging and easy to care about, and the darker parts of the stories takes players on an emotional rollercoaster.\n\nI'm disappointed that the game doesn't allow the player to go any further than holding hands and kissing the love interests, but that's more a problem with the genre (if not society) as a whole than with Cheritz specifically. There's a good chunk of the female gamer population that would enjoy more mature content in their dating games just as much as men do.\n\nGenerally, worth the price, would buy with my own money if I hadn't recieved it as a gift.","January 18, 2015","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I only played Lance because I want to get to Red's story, but the writing and his character was so good that I really enjoyed it.\n\nIt's also quite funny, there are several times that I laughed out loud at the heroine's reactions, or at Shinbi and Soi's antics.\n\nFor a fully-voiced otome game that is this good, I really think it's good value for the price.","January 18, 2015","true","29.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Almost to the secret ending, so 4.5 dolls down and 32 hours in with a fair reading speed and some skippage of common bits in Yeo's in case you want to know how long the game takes. Nice artwork and fewer mispells, though names did get mixed up a bit (not as bad as Dandelion).\n\nNameless has more drama than Dandelion, is darker and really progressed the story so you didn't have to go through the beginning 5 times.

No more boring, dull point farming. This time the other characters are still part of the story and you get to see them after you’ve chosen which boy to pursue. Unfortunately, it’s still not exactly the dating sim I was looking for. You make choices, sure, but those choices don’t really give depth. They don’t give your character personality that might appeal more to one boy and repel the other. It’s either you make the right or wrong choice. That’s it. I really wish there was a sim dating game where there was no “pursuing”, but rather you grow your character’s personality by making choices the others characters in the game can choose you just as much as you can grow fond of them.

I won't spoil it, but there is definitely more than meets the eye to the plot.\n\nThis is different from Cheritz's Dandelion game, as it is more linear. Nameless presents diverging moments in the plot as two possible options, and one railroads you toward the bad end while the other helps you continue along the plot.

I'm currently stalking their tumblr page as I write this and squeeing over every update on their new game. Anyway, Nameless is amazing.  This is not your usual fluffy have some cute guys say cute things to you type of game. There are some seriously deep and sometimes dark themes in this game and while there are many sweet moments there are also some seriously creepy ones. The writing in this game is superb. The depth of each character and the way that each one gets their own amazing storyline that causes you to fall in love with them (seriously). In many otome style visual novels I tend to feel like their are one or two toss away story arcs. I was really surprised at how much I liked each arc in this game, even characters I didn't think I would originally like. In addition, there are some strong and well developed female friendships in this game that I really appreciated. While I know Cheritz's slogan is Sweet Solutions for Female Gamers, I feel that the stories in this game could be compelling to either gender.\n\nThe mechanics of the gameplay are definitely a straight choose your own adventure on different points that lead to different endings and open up different aspects of the game without any stat building. Cheritz did add some nice touches to personalize the story and break down the fourth wall, which added to my sense of immersion.\n\nThere is no english voice acting in the game, but the Korean voice actors are really good, and even if you don't understand the language it is worth leaving the voices on. Overall, I would say it is worth the price and I could definitely see myself revisiting some of these characters again.\n\nFor playthrough order I would recommend:  Lance, Yeonho, Yuri, Tei, and Red\n\n","June 6, 2015","true","65.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's just sad, that Zion doesn't has a route. He was really cute and I wanted to tease him like Mr. Hobin did. A side story of Zion and Soi becoming a couple would be cool.\n\nAnyway I really enjoyed the game and I need to salute to the voice actors. They were really awesome. Especially Tei's voice actor.The way they spoke, made me laugh, sad, mad and weird. The creepy moments made the game really interesting. I loved it. (Am I weird? haha) I was surprised to hear that Lance's voice actor, acts for the grandpa too. lol\nThe music was beautiful and suits all the characters so well. The character design and the backgrounds are so lovely. I love the pastel color of the game very much.\n\n\n\n***SPOILER***\nMy thoughts of each character:\n\nLance: Cold, ice prince, but a kind and warm-hearted doll. I really love him from the beginning till the end of his story-line. I also love his character design a lot. The funny moments when he get flustered or embarrassed was the best. But the most parts I liked about him was his caring and the way he loves the heroine. Oh, and the part when he said that you can call my name all night.....haha\n\nRed: Super Hero, cute, stupid and a really caring doll. I like his route, but I got a little annoyed at some parts. I think its because he was being too protective. At least it turned out well. The best thing I liked was him acting slow. That made the story really funny, when Lance attacked him.\n\nTei: Lovely, caring, creepy, yandere.....Tei, he is my favourite of all characters. Many people would disagree, but I really think without him the bond between the dolls doesn't exist. I know that he creeps out many player and everyone doesn't like him for being in all the bad endings, especially on Yeonhos. But this is how he is. A heart-broken doll who loves the heroine very much. I really love how he cares about the heroine and I understand his behavior. He supports her. He loves her. He would do everything for her for not getting hurt. He wants her happiness, even thought he knows that he will never get the chance to get the love back. It makes me sad to see him like this....Out of all the characters, I want to heal his broken heart the most.  PS: The voice actor was really really awesome and I love his deep manly, kind voice. I also love the way he spokes on the ZZZ dairy.\n\nYuri: Perverted teacher, my honey, annoying, good looking sexy doll. I love his look, but I always wanted to hit him on the face. lol He flirts to much. But he is mature, kind and manly when the situation changed...I love to see a teacher, student relationship in the game. haha\n\nYeonho: The lil chick, cute, awakening the momma feelings. adorable doll. You want to protect him , but at the same time you want to tease him. He's really cute, but he's more like a little brother than a BF.....\n\nNameless: Mad, insane, creepy, forgotten teddy bear. Going through all the stories makes me feel so bad for him. He was forgotten by the heroine. He tried to find a way to come back to her arms....I really love him in the game, because the way he talks was creepy, but at the same time funny and teasing. I like the way he talks to me, the gamer. He teased me and makes me want to talk with him. At some parts i was getting mad at him for teasing me lol....\n\nWizard: Woho, I love to see him here on Nameless. He was entertaining, haha. His love for the heroin still remains here. I hope to see him on the further games of cheritz.\n\nSoi: Best friend, pretty, loves hot boys. I love her. Her friendship with the heroine will remain till they die. Sometimes she was annoying for, but this is what I loved about her. I wish she would get together with Zoin\n\nShinbi: Model, pretty, tall, strawberry milk. That girl, I understand her fandom. I wanna join! She is quiet, but she understands the situation and supports you.\n\nYujin: Weird school doctor who loves Beatrice, a skeleton model. If he has a route, I would play it with joy. lol\n\nHobin: He is a really kind man. I like the way he teases Zion and the way he cares for him. He is so calm~~\n\nZion: I want to tease him, more than Yeonho! He's so cute, like a little lost black cat. Why isn't there a route for him! I think everyone wants it. haha\n\n\nCheritz, thank you for creating this beautiful game. Because of you I got addict to Crobidoll and I want to own one....but they are pretty expensive....sob* Q.Q\n\nAnyway I'm looking forward for the new game of cheritz.","May 25, 2015","true","40.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art in Nameless was beautiful, the music was spot on and engaging and I had no problem over looking the typos after having such a positive experience.

I loved this game. I can say it leaves me wanting, but for all the right reasons. I was hesitant to finish it because the last character you unlock was my least favorite personality wise. I am glad I stuck through it, though. It is so rewarding, your first impression of the guys will be, wow what a typical dating sim type of guy... but your first impressions will be wrong for pretty much all of them. The fact that there is an overarching story, that goes across all the characters, also makes it very good. Most dating sim games you simply choose who you like best and just play their route blindly. With this, you will quickly see that is not the case.\n\nI recommend this for people who want a truly touching and deep story that you will be thinking about a lot, and that you will be staying up too late to finish just one more chapter. I do not recommend this if you want a "typical" dating sim (like they have on mobile) where you just pick random answers that you'd never choose in real life just so you can get the ending where you bang. All the choices in this make sense once you know the characters. I got many of the good endings just by playing on instinct. I only had to use a guide to get the bad endings, because those are actually difficult to get (which is how it should be imo). Even if you choose a "wrong" answer occasionally, it is written into the game and does not ruin anything for you.\n\nIn the end I find it hard to call this just a dating sim. I find it hard to spend much money on anything primarily text based. I am really glad I did, however. The ONLY con if I had to pick one, is that the voice acting is Korean, but it is a Korean game, and I think english voice actors would probably ham it up and sound cartoony anyways. So although I understood almost nothing of what was spoken it was still pretty nice, and I was able to clearly distinguish one voice from another pretty quickly. The actors got really into character so when its an emotionally tough place they actually sound distressed and when they are mad they actually yell... really nice from what I can discern, I just dont speak Korean so thats the only con. I want to play more of this companies games now!","December 15, 2015","true","42.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I must say that this is one of the best otome games I've ever played so far--#1 to be exact. Beautiful art (the boys, obviously. Haha.). Amazing concept and storyline; Eri's (changeable name) grandfather passed away, she began to collect more dolls to ease her loneliness of having to live inside a big house. What would happen if those dolls came to life?\n\nThere were a few typos, but I'll give them an excuse since there were LOADS OF TEXTS to read (for each guy). It'll generally take about 5-8 hours for you to finish the story for each guy. So yes, 30$ is definitely worth it.\n\nBesides the plot, I also think that the OSTs were pretty amazing, too (Aahhhhhh!!!! Too mellow, too much feels!!!! ;///;). Sometimes it gets really good to the point where I just have to stop reading, and just listen to the music itself. It is also hard to read and try not to fall asleep because of how calm it is.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that will leave you /feels/, /cute guys/, and bitterness(? if you decided to get a bad ending) this is definitely the game for you.\nHighly recommended, 9/10.","December 24, 2015","true","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There wasn't a route I didn't enjoy and it was the kind of game that left me wanting to replay routes (which doesn't always happen).

It's a visual novel, so if stat raising etc is your cuppa, you'll be disappointed. But if you want the equivalent of a choose-your-own adventure book with beautiful art and music, fantastic voice acting, and an engaging slice-of-life-style story, then this one's for you. The romance is sweet and the bad endings are, for the most part, marvelously creepy. The boys all start out as what appear to be one-note otome game stereotypes, but as Eri gets to know them, they become so much more. I enjoyed all the routes, which is a rarity for me, even with the characters that I initially thought I wouldn't care for. Eri herself is a flawed, very human, and very likeable protagonist. She's not immune to the "blushes and shyness" trope with her suitors, a pretty standard feature in this style of game, but her sense of humor and other reactions (not to mention her "o srsly?" face) manage to set her apart. All in all, a great game that's worth its price point.","May 20, 2015","true","27.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Finally I finished Nameless~\n\nPhew... this game was a roller coaster.... I never had so many mixed feelings in one game...\n\nCheritz did a really great job creating all those characters with different feelings. I also liked the supporting characters very much. It's just sad, that Zion doesn't has a route. He was really cute and I wanted to tease him like Mr. Hobin did. A side story of Zion and Soi becoming a couple would be cool.\n\nAnyway I really enjoyed the game and I need to salute to the voice actors. They were really awesome. Especially Tei's voice actor.The way they spoke, made me laugh, sad, mad and weird. The creepy moments made the game really interesting. I loved it. (Am I weird? haha) I was surprised to hear that Lance's voice actor, acts for the grandpa too. lol\nThe music was beautiful and suits all the characters so well. The character design and the backgrounds are so lovely. I love the pastel color of the game very much.\n\n\n\n***SPOILER***\nMy thoughts of each character:\n\nLance: Cold, ice prince, but a kind and warm-hearted doll. I really love him from the beginning till the end of his story-line. I also love his character design a lot. The funny moments when he get flustered or embarrassed was the best. But the most parts I liked about him was his caring and the way he loves the heroine. Oh, and the part when he said that you can call my name all night.....haha\n\nRed: Super Hero, cute, stupid and a really caring doll. I like his route, but I got a little annoyed at some parts. I think its because he was being too protective. At least it turned out well. The best thing I liked was him acting slow. That made the story really funny, when Lance attacked him.\n\nTei: Lovely, caring, creepy, yandere.....Tei, he is my favourite of all characters. Many people would disagree, but I really think without him the bond between the dolls doesn't exist. I know that he creeps out many player and everyone doesn't like him for being in all the bad endings, especially on Yeonhos. But this is how he is. A heart-broken doll who loves the heroine very much. I really love how he cares about the heroine and I understand his behavior. He supports her. He loves her. He would do everything for her for not getting hurt. He wants her happiness, even thought he knows that he will never get the chance to get the love back. It makes me sad to see him like this....Out of all the characters, I want to heal his broken heart the most.  PS: The voice actor was really really awesome and I love his deep manly, kind voice. I also love the way he spokes on the ZZZ dairy.\n\nYuri: Perverted teacher, my honey, annoying, good looking sexy doll. I love his look, but I always wanted to hit him on the face. lol He flirts to much. But he is mature, kind and manly when the situation changed...I love to see a teacher, student relationship in the game. haha\n\nYeonho: The lil chick, cute, awakening the momma feelings. adorable doll. You want to protect him , but at the same time you want to tease him. He's really cute, but he's more like a little brother than a BF.....\n\nNameless: Mad, insane, creepy, forgotten teddy bear. Going through all the stories makes me feel so bad for him. He was forgotten by the heroine. He tried to find a way to come back to her arms....I really love him in the game, because the way he talks was creepy, but at the same time funny and teasing. I like the way he talks to me, the gamer. He teased me and makes me want to talk with him. At some parts i was getting mad at him for teasing me lol....\n\nWizard: Woho, I love to see him here on Nameless. He was entertaining, haha. His love for the heroin still remains here. I hope to see him on the further games of cheritz.\n\nSoi: Best friend, pretty, loves hot boys. I love her. Her friendship with the heroine will remain till they die. Sometimes she was annoying for, but this is what I loved about her. I wish she would get together with Zoin\n\nShinbi: Model, pretty, tall, strawberry milk. That girl, I understand her fandom. I wanna join! She is quiet, but she understands the situation and supports you.\n\nYujin: Weird school doctor who loves Beatrice, a skeleton model. If he has a route, I would play it with joy. lol\n\nHobin: He is a really kind man. I like the way he teases Zion and the way he cares for him. He is so calm~~\n\nZion: I want to tease him, more than Yeonho! He's so cute, like a little lost black cat. Why isn't there a route for him! I think everyone wants it. haha\n\n\nCheritz, thank you for creating this beautiful game. Because of you I got addict to Crobidoll and I want to own one....but they are pretty expensive....sob* Q.Q\n\nAnyway I'm looking forward for the new game of cheritz.","May 25, 2015","true","40.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It gives us attractive, diverse male characters to choose from, and has an interesting plot that had me wanting to complete every single character's story so that I could get to the bottom of the overarching plot behind the game. I won't spoil it, but there is definitely more than meets the eye to the plot.\n\nThis is different from Cheritz's Dandelion game, as it is more linear. Nameless presents diverging moments in the plot as two possible options, and one railroads you toward the bad end while the other helps you continue along the plot. As such, there is less gameplay involved. Ths is why I would classify Nameless as primarily a visual novel otome.\n\n","July 10, 2015","true","30.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Anyone who enjoys dating sims, and anyone who's never played but would like to try, this is the game I would reccomend, hands down.\nThe storyline starts off pretty basic and almost cliche, a group of dolls just coming to life out of nowhere, but it grows to be so much more than that. This isn't one of those fantastical otome games like what you find on mobile where two dimesnional guys just fall in love with the heroine for no reason. This game is very, very well written and very plot heavy.\n\nSo plot heavy, in fact, that the prologe itself takes at least a good hour or two to get through.\n\nYes, it's one of the priceier games out there, but it's also one of the best. The writing is phenominal, the characters are their own people as opposed to cookie cutter troups, and the voice acting. Oh, boy, the voice acting is simply beautiful.\n\n10/10.
