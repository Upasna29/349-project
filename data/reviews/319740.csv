It might not be the first game to attempt voice commands, but it’s definitely the most successful at making it feel seamless and authentic. It’s such a brilliant hook that it almost feels like enough to carry the game, until you step back and look at how hollow the experience actually is.\n\nThe idea behind There Came An Echo is that it’s a game played almost entirely with your voice (there are mouse controls but I can’t imagine wanting to use them). Viewed from a tactical, isometric perspective you issue orders to characters, telling them where to go, who to shoot, when to reload; the sort of commands that have become instinctual to me over so many years of playing games, but here required I relearn how I interact with this sort of game down to the most basic function. By requiring I put previously silent button presses into words, There Came An Echo felt intensely engaging. I couldn’t rely on muscle memory and doze off, I had to constantly be aware of what was happening and find the words to convey that to my troops if I wanted to make it through a mission.\n\nWhere There Came An Echo rises above other voice activated games is in how much freedom you have in creating these commands, and how well the game interprets them. Rather than a strict list of possible orders I could give, I’d often find myself just naturally forming sentences and being shocked at how often they came out the way I wanted to. There were some instances where I attempted more complex commands than the game could comprehend and needed to break them down, but when There Came An Echo is working as intended it feels like something revolutionary, which thankfully is far more often than not.\n\nBut what are you actually doing with all these commands? That’s sort of the problem. While There Came An Echo incorporates some impressive tech, its other systems are comparatively very shallow. My first thought when realizing that the voice commands worked as intended was to wonder how far I could take them, but most scenarios I was placed in gave me little room for dynamic play. Maps are narrow and linear, and different weapon loadouts offer only very slight alterations to how you play. In a sense it feels like the game is directing you as much as you are your units, putting restrictions on what you can and can’t do while pretending to be more strategically deep than it ever becomes.\n\nI’d have likely accepted this though if what There Came An Echo cares about most, its narrative, was worth the immense amount of time spent on it. Far from being merely drawn out and overbearing though, the writing here is positively painful. It’s also very, very weird, in its plot, its tone, its character motives; everything, really. Each line is full of earnest attempts at self-awareness, baffling plot twists, and unending amounts of technical mumbo jumbo.\n\nIt isn’t even that There Came An Echo is written so poorly, but that it gives off such a strong impression that it thinks otherwise. It tries so hard that I sort of just feel sorry for it, wondering if there was some way it could be salvaged but always coming up empty. But when it takes up more of the game than anything else, it’s difficult to write it off as just regrettable. The narrative is always there, pushing its one-dimensional characters, overreaching plot, and shallow questions as to what it means to be alive in your face and forcing you to humor them. And then it fridges one of its female characters and reminds you yet again that “♥♥♥♥♥” is its favorite word and any sympathy quickly disperses.\n\nI’m not exaggerating when I say There Came An Echo’s use of voice commands is one of the coolest ways I’ve played a game in years. It never stops being cool either and I hope other developers will look at this and start experimenting with their own games. There Came An Echo succeeds at proving an idea works and can add a lot to a game, but when that’s all it does while bringing along with so much fluff it’s difficult for me to recommend playing it on that basis alone. I don’t consider voice commands a gimmick, but them being the sole draw here has effectively reduced them to one.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","April 27, 2015","false","4.5"," 186 of 222 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","186","222","4","4"

I backed the game on Kickstarter, so I got early access. The four hours game time recorded by steam were enough to for me to finish the game. There is not much replayability. The game has the "War room" mode for instant battles (that I have not tired yet), but the limited complexity of the combat (see below) is unlikely to give this feature longevity\n* A significant fraction of the game time is spend in in-engine cut-scenes without interactivity. Telling the story.\n* The story is interesting and touches a number of concepts from transhumanist philosophy (I'd love to discuss it further, but want to avoid spoilers). It has some more and some less surprising twists.\n* In case you were wondering - there does not seem to be any branching story-line, apparently the player can not influence the outcome in any way\n* The voice acting is quite exceptional (especially for an indie game), as is the music\n* unfortunately, I found the characters to be a bit "tropy" and one-dimensional, especially as there are not one but two "revenge stories"\n\nThe gameplay takes a bit of a back seat:\n* For me (using a decent quality gaming headset) the speech recognition worked very well, even tough English is not my native language. There were a few words that consistently were not recognised, so I switched to the mouse for those after a while. I have not tried changing the standard commands.\n* it was an interesting experience to use voice commands, and I don't believe it has been so integral to any game before\n* the combat itself is not particularly complex or dificult. I played on "Medium" (the preset difficulty) and got through most battles in the first try\n* the characters shoot automatically, and in most situations it is just a matter of ordering them to the appropriate position and wait for the enemies to be shot. Each character has one (later two) of four special weapon modes equipped that can be selected, but require "energy" (which is equivalent to character health in the game). There are no special abilities.\n* voice-controlled instant-failure stealth section - I'm not a fan, sorry.\n\nAll in all, the game was an unusual and fun but also short and in some places flawed experience. It is not particularly expensive, so if you can spare the money (or wait for a sale) and are willing to accept the weaknesses, I would recommend it.","February 24, 2015","true","4.0"," 136 of 160 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","136","160","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FreakOramaXD/recommended/319740/","FreakOramaXD","FreakOrama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FreakOramaXD/","737 products in account","There Came An Echo is an innovative, or just plain great, real-time strategy game that pits you in the shoes of a commander, with either voice controls or normal KBM controls, issuing various commands to your squad using its immersive voice recognition system. So let's start.\n\nThe graphics are slick and smooth, with beautiful colors and effects, and the animations being sufficient and somewhat oddly charming, followed by a nice clean edgy UI. The soundtrack is fitting with the game, and it's awesome, being catchy, diverse, and filled with a sense of.. justice and adventure to reach one's goal in the coolest possible way, with having an epiphany at some point.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agg6dn_GecY&list=UU-bYm-N2k6pVVh1YQHCsCqA\n\nThere are two types of controls, the main one being voice controls, which is not perfect in any way, but actually works decently, and it has a lot of options for you to make it work, where you can choose the type of language you speak, or if you have an accent, which is nice, but obviously not every language is included. I had a problem with the game to recognize my voice when I called on one one of the character names, so I added a custom name that it could recognize, and it worked smoothly, at least a lot better than before. So if the game's voice recognition doesn't work for you, you can 'make' it work, and you can make it fun too with most if not all commands being customizable. To note again, it's obviously not perfect but it's functional and playable, aside from a few frustrating moments where it would just not work. It's something new in games that isn't played with a lot, it's working and I like it. I'd also advise to make it push to talk, as I got better controls with it.\n\nGoing to gameplay, playing with the voice controls, it's fun, easy, and you feel this sense of immense immersion as the whole game is somewhat fourth-wall breaking, bringing you, as the person behind the screen, into the game's story, world, and its interactions between characters, making you feel like a necessary part in the game's universe, an important role as an independent character, and that's a really awesome feeling.\n\nGoing to actual gameplay elements aside from what I said, you issue commands to your squad like to 'move to' a certain location, 'open fire' on an enemy, 'take cover' or 'hold position', and preform complex tasks immediately or at certain times of your choosing. You can also customize your squade in terms of what types of weapons they can carry and what type of passive ability they hold. The game also has nice progression in terms of difficulty curves, slowly but surely increasing it over time, over missions. It's fun and strategic, and somehow it achieved simplicity in its complexity.\n\nThe story of the game is satisfying, with a type of story that doesn't get covered in games much, reminding me of certain futuristic/sci-fi cartoon shows but more advanced, which is kind of nice and refreshing. The characters are really diverse, unique, and fun to watch their actions and interactions with each other, with great voice acting too, with each one having their own story that's made visible to the player. They also have mystery characters leaving you curious and excited to know their identity and their story. Also, the game plays its characters as normal people of this day and age, and nice mentions of what we have now in terms of tech and social media, with fun references that made me laugh when mentioned/revealed.\n\nBack to story again, just wanted to add that the more I was nearing to the end of it, the more I was satisfied and in love with it, with how it was going. A lot of emotions rising, twists turning, fourth-walls being demolished, and the ending was amazing. My satisfaction liquid in my head was boiling. It was that freaking good to me, and I honestly didn't expect it from the game. I applaud and thank the writer(s) of the game for their awesome work, and heck the game should feature "Awesome Story Writing" in its store page.\n\nI want more games like this, with the creative freedom actually being free from shackles of limitations, going full on out, with the all passion and love going in it. For that asking price, the game is a steal. There Came An Echo is just a fantastic, creative, unique, innovative, fun, charming, awesome game. The graphics are desirable and beautiful, the soundtrack is one to admire, the gameplay of tactics and strategy, with the applied voice controls are fun, intense, exciting, and immersive. The story is wondrous, and the whole presentation is top-notch, heck the game's presentation and story was even more cinematic than a game that was designed to be cinematic *wink*. The whole game is one to be awarded, as it deserves mine and a lot more. I hope they make a sequel with all out better tech, better tools, better everything so they can make their next game in that universe even better, and I cannot wait to see what the same developers ,with the same creative freedom, innovation, and support, do next.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","February 24, 2015","true","7.8"," 76 of 109 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","76","109","5","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/319740/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","I really wanted to like this game, because I loved Sequence (which is now renamed Before the Echo) and I learned that this game is a continuation of it. I had heard that you could play the game with a mouse if you didn't want to use the game's voice commands, and so I decided to try it out, but I wanted to give the voice commands a fair chance anyways. On a technical level, they work fine, and the game never had any trouble recognizing my voice, but they just don't add anything to the gameplay. There are a limited number of phrases that you use and most of the gameplay is just directing your squad members to the right designated points on the map and letting them do their thing, and even with the option of being able to swap out the game's default phrases and words with custom ones I never felt like I was actually talking to a squad because the technology just isn't there for it to be able to recognize anything more than the handful of preset phrases that you'll recite over and over throughout the game. The natural assumption would be to just switch to mouse controls, as I did, but you don't have to play for more than a few seconds to see just how awful it is. Instead of having a traditional point-and-click interface, you play the game by holding the right mouse button to bring up a contextual wheel with various orders on it to emulate the lines you give to your squad when using the voice commands, and it's a massive pain to use in the middle of gameplay. If you have to shoot a particular person for a mission, for example, in order to shoot them with the mouse controls you have to hover over them, hold the right mouse button, and search for the "target unit x" option, instead of just clicking on them like most games. In a turn-based game this would be fine, but in a real-time game it's counter-intuitive and makes the game a chore to play.\n\nThe story is still there, so if you really liked Sequence/Beyond the Echo like I did and this game goes down on sale enough it might be worth checking out just to see the story (though the game is pretty short, so you may want to wait for a particularly deep sale), but overall this game is just another example of "if it isn't broke, don't fix it".","June 30, 2015","false","3.6"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","1"

I really wish the game had a Calibration for you voice. The game pretty much wings that lol. The only thing it calibrates is the voice sensitivity which I feel like the game developers should have figured out a better calibration. That is my main issue. The cost of the game will be worth it if you had no problems with your voice commands. I would personally want more gameplay more story.\n\nIf I had to recomend to the developers is make a demo version of There Came of Echo.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/319740/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","436 products in account","In a digitally-aware world encryption is everything. In light of recent revelations involving the NSA and GCHQ spying on much of the world’s internet traffic, encryption has become a hot button issue. Whether you know how it works or not, it’s there securing your online presence against unwanted intruders.  And yet, how often do you stop and think about the people who make your communications and data secure? Not often, I’ll wager.  In There Came An Echo, Corrin is one of those people, one of those geniuses, you might say. He’s your typical computer whizz and he is about to become embroiled in something larger than himself, or anything the physical world has to offer.\n\nCorrin anonymously released an open source encryption software into the public domain, called Radial Lock. Its claim to fame is that it cannot be broken in any way, and its open source code is testament to that, but there’s one problem: the hardware to support it does not exist yet. Or so Corrin thinks.  Unbeknownst to him, Radial Lock has been put into use by a shadowy organisation and it is securing some highly coveted data. He quickly finds himself backed into his office whilst armed troopers search for him, and that’s where Val and Sam come in.\n\nVal acts as Corrin’s assistant and overseer, while Sam takes on the role of commander and provides the orders that will keep him safe. You will assume control of  Sam and direct Corrin, and his comrades, through dicey situations to find out who is searching for him, and for what cause. You won’t be using traditional control methods to guide Corrin though, granted they are there if you want to, instead you are encouraged to use nothing more than the power of your voice to guide him on his dangerous mission.\n\n“Voice controls?”, I hear you moan dubiously. “Yes, voice controls”, I retort in a confident manner. There Came An Echo‘s main draw, aside from sporting Wil Wheaton as the voice of Corrin, is that you can control the game almost entirely with your voice. Past games have attempted this to some degree of success, but never in a way that felt essential, or anything other than an afterthought. There Came An Echo brings this control scheme front and centre,, with Val gently guiding you through the game’s various systems, such as movement, weapon swapping and attacking. The system is quite robust, allowing you to order multiple units around at the same time, or dish out commands to all but one unit. Within a few minutes of getting to grips with the voice commands I began to feel distinctly like I was gaming in the future. This is what a gaming evolution should feel like.\n\nOrdering Corrin and his accomplices around is so smooth and intuitive that it becomes second nature almost immediately, but there are some caveats that you will need to understand fully before beginning. While the voice command system is incredibly in-depth, and works with many different dialects and accents, even my Scottish accent, it relies on you being clear and enunciating each and every word. If you mumble or shout Val will pop up on-screen to let you know that no one can understand what you are saying. Be it through necessity, or just my wish to stop having Val pop up on my screen, I quickly learned the ins and outs of the system.\n\nControlling Corrrin using nothing other than my voice was an absolute blast. Aside from the few times where the voice recognition system refused to play ball, everything played out so cleanly that I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. And that is no understatement. Telling units, calmly and clearly, to switch guns and travel to new defensive points on the map, and seeing them do exactly as I said is something of a watershed moment in gaming for me.  You don’t have complete control over your units though, and they do not have the ability to freely roam each level, instead there are zones dotted throughout each area which you will guide Corrin to using the phonetic alphabet. So, if you want Corrin to go to Alpha One, you would simply say “Corrin go to alpha 1″. Or, if you are lazy like me you can simply say “Corrin, Alpha 1″, and he will run towards that location. In the heat of battle you will be dishing out orders at a brisk pace, so remember to be calm and clear, you’ll have a much more fun if you do. You’ll also get to feel like an awesome tactician!\n\nAll missions in There Came An Echo play out very similarly, first starting out with a load out screen where you can choose each party member’s guns and perks. As well as the bog-standard pistol you can choose a secondary weapon which drains your energy bar as you use it. Energy is important because it powers your shields, so you’ll want to use your sidearm carefully and effectively. Although it is possible to use your pistol for most of the combat, you will probably struggle to proceed in some of the tougher parts of the game.\n\nFinding yourself under heavy fire from enemies wielding charge guns is a common occurrence, but you can turn the tables on them by laying down suppressive fire with the screw gun. When your opponents are on the backfoot you can then attempt to flank them with a unit or two, and hit them with a taste of their own medicine. Let me tell you, there are few more exhilirating feelings than successfully outwitting your enemies in There Came An Echo.  Each level is dotted with these tactical opportunities which highlight wonderfully just how responsive and fun the voice recognition system can be. Admittedly, the action is formulaic but Iridium throw a few curveballs in there to keep you on your toes, too.\n\nAs a spoiler-free review I won’t delve too much into There Came An Echo’s story, but it is filled with deceit, mistrust, love and greed. You may even come away questioning the nature of your very existence. With multiple agencies out to find him, Corrin is torn in multiple different directions by people who want to use him for their own gain. Over the course of the game he transforms from a nerdy, bookish type into a man who is able to take the initiative and do what needs to be done to ensure his survival. The highest of praise should be lavished upon the entire voice cast for bringing a touch of emotion and realism to what can otherwise be a sterile genre. Wheaton, in particular, shines with a solid performance throughout.\n\nThere Came An Echo could be the title that takes voice controlled games into the mainstream. Voice recognition should no longer be a selling point to be cynically emblazoned upon a game’s box, in the hopes that consumers who don’t know any better will buy it.  It should be here to stay, and the hard work that Iridium have put in should be refined and incremented upon for future titles. Quite simply, it sets a standard by which all future games with voice controls should be judged.\n\nMore please.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDisclosure: review copy provided by Iridium.

Can I call it that?) with a grain of salt because the vast majority of my complaints lie with the control system and not the actual game itself. My voice works spectacularly well in some games (Binary Domain, In Verbis Vertus as some examples) and I do not possess an "accent". For reference, I am an American (USA).\n\nThere Came An Echo is a intelligently designed game that focuses around a group of well designed characters, with excellent voice acting and strong, individual personalities. Nobody in this game is cookie cutter. In fact, Yuri Lowenthal voices a character in the game and I didn't recognize that it was Yuri Lowenthal. That might resonate with you, maybe not. Anyway.\n\nPAUSE\n\nSorry, the review just paused itself as I was writing it, maybe I breathed too heavy into the mic\n\nPAUSE\n\nOkay so maybe I can get to the point. There Came An Echo uses some very interesting tactical gameplay mechanics. In forcing you to not be able to pause every decision you make is on the fly. There are a few missions in which the game implements a timer button that you have to keep track of and interact with before it hits 0. You cannot pause to remind yourself how much time you have left, you just have to keep pushing forward. There are several interesting weapon mechanics. The Screw weapon will suppress the enemy, preventing him from using his special weapon allowing your teammates to flank or use their special weapons. The Charge is a grenade, allowing you to take out groups of enemies with ease. The sniper rifle offers high damage so long as the user can fire uninterrupted - any weapon fire will stall a sniper shot, not just the Screw. However.\n\nAll of this is marred by an absolutely abysmal control scheme. Despite my best efforts, voice commands worked only about 40-50% of the time. And yes, while mouse controls are an option, they also are equally frustrating as they rely heavily on contextual actions. Right clicking in any RTS would command your unit to an area. In TCAE, right clicking will sometimes direct characters to what you want them to do. Most of the time this is when you click on a Phonetic Area, Alpha 1 and Foxtrot 6 as it were. You cannot direct your units to locations other than predetermined areas. This allows for a much more streamlined tactical experience as flanking positions are highlighted for you, and your units will outright refuse to perform stupid / risky maneuvers such as charging headfirst into an occupied enemy positon.\n\nThe rest of the time you click, a contextual menu opens up. Now, if you were right clicking on an enemy in an effort to target him, woops you just accidently wasted one of your battery packs, used to refill your energy which is used for both health and ammunition. Often times the contextual menu is difficult to close, which is frustrating in a game where you cannot pause to determine actions. Additionally, every single action you choose to order for your units via the mouse is called out by Val, your secondary entity who offers Intel support and direction for your team throughout the story. How irritated you are with Val telling you "You're too loud, your squad can't hear you" (occupying valuable time you could be delivering orders) or "They aren't conscious, Sam" which makes no sense, is entirely dependant on how well your headset / mic and your voice operating on the game works for you. I hated her by the end of the game more than the antagonists.\n\nFinally, we come to my last and final determination on why I don't think There Came An Echo is worth playing. In a game such as this, where the plot drives the game forward, immersion is key. Ignoring every gripe I had with the combat which despite being frustrating, was fluid when it worked and actually fairly satisfying. In the last moment of the game, it took me six separate tries to speak the words asked of me by the characters in the game to finish the game. My immersion has never been so shattered in a game before this one. Every single time you try to order a character and it doesn't work, and that character gets themself killed either because they misheard you or the mouse commands failed, it breaks my immersion with the game. This game left me more frustrated than satisfied, and not in the "It's Dark Souls hard" kind of way.\n\nAs I stated in the beginning, take this review with a grain of salt. I will give you some of the salt that this game gave to me to do so. If, by some fateful chance, you manage to operate the game at 100% efficiency with your voice, I'd imagine that you would have an enjoyable time with the tactical gameplay and, presuming that the plot is your cup of tea, you will enjoy the ride. Personally, I could not, and so I cannot recommend the game.","December 1, 2015","false","5.1"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

Also activating commands during transitions can cause the game to crash and/or corupt saves.  This is also another game where the Devs are closing threads for damage control.

The story is really bland.  It starts off trying to mimic a popular movie from yesteryears.  And one by one you are introduced to the main characters of the story.  However, there was nothing that attached me to any of the main characters.  At one point a character is having a dramatic moment with an antagonist in the story and I realized... I really don't care about any of these characters.  They were all introduced very briefly and not expounded upon in any meaningful way.  And when I don't even care about the main characters, how am I supposed to care about the over all story?  It just doesn't work out.  And the premise of the game itself just tries way too hard and falls well short of its intent.\n\nThe voice acting is just bleh.  It is very uninspired.  It comes off more like people just reading a script than actually acting, which is weird because it actually was at least 1 legit actor.  But at least the music is good.\n\nAs for gameplay.  It was fun to control characters with voice and the game does seem adept at it.  But I think in the end it just ends up being a gimmick that gets boring a couple missions in.  You can't move anyone around freely.  You can't give them interesting commands.  Nothing works other than preset commands.  It just lacks that extra polish.  In most of the fights I don't even feel like I have to even try, and that is a good thing because they've made it very difficult to actually try hard.  Gun fights are over pretty quickly and the gap between being able to give commands and commands registering is just unfortuneately too long.\n\nMost of the input I have is just telling them when to heal and sometimes to switch to a weapon, which by the time it happens, I no longer need them using that weapon and the longer they use it they just end up killing their own shields anyway.\n\nJust the bullet points of this short review:\n- game play is gimmicky and doesn't stay interesting long\n- voice acting and story is below mediocre\n- voice input, while interesting and somewhat accurate, just ends up taking a long time and feels unrewarding for the effort\n- However, the music is good.\n\nSmall spoiler:\nThe whole scene where they kill a group of guys through their shielding with some anti-shield explosion was lame as hell.  "Good thing we didn't have our shields up".  Can the writing get any worse?","March 8, 2015","false","4.0"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

I did however purchase the soundtrack after playing it.\n\nTime to completion: Around 4 hours.\nReplay value: Not much.\n\nI think that this is a good game, but a cautious recommendation. It is an almost fully voice-controlled squad-style RTS. As such the strategy is a simple set of commands you can give your team such as "All Units Move to Alpha 1" and "Corrin Attack Target 2." However the voice commands worked very well for me and when everything clicks it really feels like you are a commander of a small squad. I can definitely make you feel very cool.\n\nPros:\n- AMAZING SOUNDTRACK. I mean seriously, wow. Big Giant Circles + Ronald Jenkees = eargasm.\n- Good story, well written characters.\n- Great voice acting with big name talent like Laura Bailey (♥), Wil Wheaton, Ashly Burch, and Yuri Lowenthal.\n- The feeling of being a commander through voice control alone.\n- Inventive game mechanics. I've never really played anything like it. Now that the mechanics are in place I would love to see a sequel.\n- Beautiful 2D visuals.\n- You can create funny aliases for commands.\n\nCons:\n- Lacking polish in some areas. I ran into various bugs with the UI clipping on my 16:10 display and some scripting errors that caused my teammates to refuse to fire their weapons. The developers seem very intent to fix these issues so this might be fixed by the time you read this anyway.\n- Voice control can sometimes fail and can be very frustrating. Even 95% accuracy is really annoying 5% of the time.\n- Occasionally some awkward dialog that could have benefited from an editor.\n- Short game at around 4 hours in length without much replayability.\n- Some animations show their low budget-ness. There are some awkward motions and poses.\n\nMy recommendation: If you're frugal it's worth $10 so look out for a sale. The soundtrack however is worth every penny.","February 24, 2015","true","4.6"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","16","27","0","0"

There were times I would tell Syll to do something and Miranda (or "My" as I named her) would swap weapons or run to hard points.\n\nSecondly, the in-game cutscenes aren't just unskippable, they take the camera hostage and throw you into the action without notice. This would be fine if it were simply added for dramatic effect, but your team is taking damage and it doesn't zoom back out or tell you that you're *actually* in a battle. Even ignoring the game's bland art assets and scene settings this was poor design.\n\nThirdly, the story and voices are duller than a Playdoh spoon. I'm not saying the script writers and voice actors *literally* phoned it in, but they sure as ♥♥♥♥ did metaphorically speaking. The only characters that have any actual "character" are Val and Miranda, but even then it's glaringly obvious there was direction or inspiration given to their respective voice actors.\n\nLastly, while I was playing the game in English I came to a point where a countdown might compromise the mission unless I said "Anular". After saying a combination of "anular/Grace go to anular/team anular" etc. a few dozen times I figured I must be pronouncing it incorrectly. No, it turns out "anular" is the game's Spanish equivalent of "Activate Override". Is it a nitpicky point? Yup. Was it also an incredibly irritating and stupid oversight? You betcha.\n\nI'd love to see more voice-controlled games in the future, but this simply falls short in every regard apart from the novelty are attempting it.","March 21, 2015","false","3.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

The game starts out in a reenactment of the beginning of The Matrix. The story follows Corrin, a cryptographer, as he tries to find out why people want to break his software, Radial Lock. The story seemed generic to me, but the comedy was a great distraction. The gameplay is solid if you are using the voice controlled method, but the keyboard/mouse controls are very bad. Along with the bad keyboard/mouse controls, the main story is very short, and there is no extra content after the campaign. The voice controls are done extremely well, and even if the game doesn’t understand something, you can change the words for each command to suit you.\nPros\nRefreshing gameplay\nFunny interactions\nVoice commands can be fully customized\nMatrix references (makes any game better )\nThe story is told well\nGreat voice acting\n\n\n\nCons\nVoice control can be off\nStory seems generic\nBad keyboard/mouse support\nShort story\nNo content after the story mode\nNo multiplayer\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThere Came an Echo is a very unique RTS with amazingly done voice controls.

There's some light tactics to the combat, but nothing brain melting.  More important to your decision to buy this thing is whether the game is good and works as intended.  Spoiler alert, nope on both counts.\n\nThis is kind of a weird, gimmick heavy game that doesn't do what the genre at its core is loved for.  It operates mostly on voice commands, but you can't guarantee that any one directive will be clearly heard and understood by the game, and in the context of a time sensitive situation, you'll likely find yourself getting screwed over by wonky game mechanics again and again.  Or you can do everything right, be heard completely clearly, and just get wrecked thanks to imbalanced, RNG heavy real time combat.\n\nWhat I played of the story was okay, the voice acting was really good, I love Laura Bailey to death.  I also played a bit of Sequence, the developer's previous game, and there were some similarities in the writing and tone.  They're going for sarcastic and witty with their characters, but often hit closer to obnoxious and bratty.\n\nBut more importantly, the game's just not fun, so don't buy it.","February 25, 2015","false","4.0"," 25 of 45 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","25","45","3","0"

Between the voice controls and art style to the story and music/voice-over, this game is a prime example of what games could become. Granted, Binanry Domain tried this first, but There came an echo refined this technology to the point where it is rather usable instead of just shouting into the Microphone. It is no where near perfect, but it is damn close. Combined with the ability to create your own voice commands, this game can be either Highly customizable to the point where you just want to say "SHUT UP, WESLEY!" for every action in-game\n\nVoice acting in this game is rather well done. With such talent as Ashly Burch and Wil Wheaton in the cast, you come out with characters that almost seem like they could be people you meet up on in real life(barring a few acceptions).  With the combination of background music made by Big Giant Circles and Ronald Jenkees, It can really get your Blood flowing.\n\nWith that being said, It is by no means perfect. As I stated before, Voice commands are no-where near perfect but the technology can be improved by either upgrading you microphone or creating your own commands. There are times when the camera is wrestled away from you and you can't see what the hell you are doing but those moments are far and few between. Voice acting at times can feel hammy but, again, I feel those moments are far and few between. The BIGGEST concern is that this game feels a bit short. With only Ten missions to go on, It feels that a lot was cut from the game.\n\nAll in all, Not perfect, still great, kinda hoping that there is a sequel or DLC.","June 17, 2015","true","2.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Melovinci/recommended/319740/","Melovinci","Icarus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Melovinci/","483 products in account","In There Came an Echo, you play the mysterious voice-in-the-ear commander of a growing squad of people caught up in a digital-based conspiracy that affects all their lives (though as far as I can tell, doesn’t really have dire consequences for the rest of the world). You are essentially Morpheus in the first 20 minutes of the Matrix.\n\nSo the big question: how is the voice control? The answer: not bad. I only encountered two real problems with it and they were both easily solvable. The first was that I was speaking too fast for the recognition software to pick up anything. I solved this by slowing down my speech and being more clear (no s**t). The reason I was even speaking fast in the first place was because There Came an Echo really puts you under the pump. There’s no pausing to give commands or survey the battlefield. It’s all in real-time. Which means you need to give concise and correct commands there and then, otherwise your squad members die. That being said, there’s still a bit of wriggle room as there’s no one-hit kills or anything like that. There Came an Echo has done really well to balance out combat pacing and excitement alongside a forgivable command system which still has consequences for bad, slow or incomprehensible commands.\n\nThat being said, the voice control isn’t perfect. I still have to repeat my orders every now and then and as the game constantly reminds me, shouting into the microphone is not the way to get your orders across. Still doesn’t stop from me from cursing Wheaton’s name when he asks me to repeat myself.\n\nDo I recommend There Came an Echo? Yes, the game is fun, intense and exciting. And by using voice recognition, you feel slightly more immersed in the world and universe. You’re not longer a dude or dudette sitting a computer playing a game. You are a commander of a slightly disfunctional squad and you are in a position of power.\n\nFor full review, visit:\nhttp://icarusreviews.net/2015/04/19/there-came-an-echo/","April 18, 2015","true","2.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

To make matters worse there are times when your timing has to be perfect and at those critical points I find myself repeating commands only to fail the objective when the system does not understand what I’m saying.  Now it might be my accent or cadence but I use other voice control software (Voice Attack) with other games and I have had less issues.\n\nI kept thinking though the whole thing that I wanted a controller to move and have the voice for all the secondary functions.

I`ve spoken english since I was little and even lived in the US for a while but I often had to restart a mission because my commands weren`t being recognised.\n\nNow for the review:\n\nThere Came an Echo`s excellent voice commands are a dream come true to a lot of gamers! For them alone the game is worth buying. Fortunately, however, even if you`re not all that interested in voice commands, the game still doesn`t disappoint. Here`s a general idea of what I thought about the different parts of the game.\n\nLenght: this is the first topic, since I think it will be the deciding factor for a lot of people when considering whether to pick it up right now or wait for it to go on sale. The game is short. The 4ish hours it takes to complete the campaign are very good, and the game does have a proper ending and a good pacing, but the lack of a "horde" mode, or a mission editor hurts the replayability and therefore the value of the game. And that`s sad, because I would probably spend hours playing those modes if they were there, I just really liked the gameplay.\n\nMission design: Over the course of the campaign the game throws various scenarios at you and each one approaches the mechanics in a different way. The developers got really creative with the ways they could explore the game`s systems and mechanics. The game never gets repetitive. And I think this is one of the things that sets this game apart from other tactical shooters in a good way.\n\nStory: The story is good and unique. Nice refresher from the usual generic plotlines. However it feels very rushed, most plot points go by extremely fast with barely any time for them to sink in. And it hurts the game because it has some pretty intense plot twists. You`ll often find yourself wondering how in the world did you get to where you are right now. Character development is also pretty weak sometimes. Most characters are gone so fast after you`ve met them that you can`t find yourself caring for them. The characters themselves are good though, and if they had more time to be fleshed out they might`ve turned out to be some people`s favorite video game characters. What I`m trying to say is you can see a glimpse of their potential every now and then.\n\nVoice acting: I don`t usually have a problem with voice acting, this game is no exception.\n\nMusic and Sound design: The music is awesome, one of the best soundtracks I`ve heard in a game recently. The sounds are great too, very immersive.\n\nArt and graphics: Although the graphics aren`t ultra realistic or anything they`re fine, models look better than in Wasteland 2, for example. The art though is really nice, I loved almost every level, and the UI is very nice to look at too. Definitely a pro!!!!\n\nCombat: the voice commands make the game`s combat stand out. Otherwise it would be a passable tactical shooter. There are enough weapon options, but the fact that better weapons drain the same resource as your hp, and the way enemy waves approach you left me using no more than 3 weapon types for the duration of the campaign.\n\nLevel Design: the level design usually changes with the mission design, but cover and enemy placement does manage to get repetitive by the end. Also, one of my biggest gripes with the games is that, specially at the later levels, there are cover points that can`t be used by more than one or 2 party member, and I found myself more than once in a situaltion where I was left with only or two character who were able to take cover and other times, I had the problem where characters couldnt shoot from cover. For a game where your movement is limited to what cover points you`re allowed to send your party members this is a big issue.\n\nBugs: Overall I didn`t find many bugs, I recall having to reset a checkpoint a couple of times because a character didn`t transition into the next area, and that`s about it. Never a crash to desktop or anything. And the devs have been really fast and good at delivering patches!!!!\n\nIn the end, There Came an Echo is a very nice game that delivers 100% on its promise. However, the minor technical issues and the short story might mean an on sale purchase for some people. To me, however, the small team of devs have done, and keep doing, such a good job that I feel compelled to buy it at full price just to support their studio!\n\nI`m really looking forward to a sequel, expansion, new game mode and/or map editor open to the community, like in Shadowrun. Hopefully the devs fell the same.","March 11, 2015","true","5.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Dramatic scenes call for a little melodrama. Laura Bailey is one of my favorite voice actresses. Period. And she kills it in this.

But I'll still recommend it for the novel control scheme which is implemented very well.  Please actually read my review rather than just taking my recommendation as an endorsement because there are some strong caveats and TCaE may not be for you.\n\nFirst off, the voice controls are excellent.  They don't work 100% of the time but when they do they're great and the feedback for them is excellent.  It's worth owning for this and this alone and for the future promise it might show.  Unfortunately, this is where the problems start developing.\n\nLack of Polish\nTCaE's voice controls work very well most of the time but when they don't it's incredibly frustrating.  One of the big issues is it's not entirely clear when the game is listening to you.  It seems to listen almost all the time but during some cut-scenes or when other characters are speaking it sometimes won't. Any time you need to repeat yourself, you get a little bit rage-y.\n\nAnother major problem is how limited some of the commands seem.  You can add your own aliases and that works surprisingly well but it can be frustrating when you're trying to say "stop firing" or "cease fire" and what the game wants to hear is "hold your fire".  There are a good deal of alternate commands built in but it feels like there aren't enough.\n\nYou can give the characters aliases which is a nice bit of fun.  It's the Oregon Trail effect.  Just like it was hilarious to see your best friends and family contract disentary, it is fun to order them to put their shields up or run around.  But unfortunately, the aliases are essentially just "nick names" so even though I can say "Diane! Move to Alpha 3!" on the map the character's name is still Mirranda. So in addition to the list of valid commands you have to constantly remember which of the characters you've nicknamed what.\n\nThe voice control even works in the menus.  This is absolutely fantastic.  The first time I did it I instantly wished every game would implement it.  You don't need to memorize any commands (other than "Pause" and "Back") because all you're doing is reading the button names. But... again problems.  Maybe there's a bug but it seems like not every menu is fully voice navigable.  The voice controls make for a great "lean-back" experience but every time you get stuck in a menu and have to lean forward to use your mouse it completely takes you out of the experience.  Ditto for moving around the map.  There are some voice controls, "Zoom to Bravo 6!", but no good way to zoom all the way out or pan around without using the mouse.  Fully zoomed out, by the way, the icons become pretty difficult to read meaning you'll probably have to use the mouse a lot just to keep checking on where all the characters and movement options are.\n\nThe final thing that disappointed me was the voice acting.  I was honestly surprised because the voice actors (including the infamous Wil Wheaton) are, for the most part, excellent! The problem is one of editing and spacing.  It feels very much like the actors each read their lines in a vacuum without being able to react to each other.  Sometimes there is a mismatch of tone that just feels... weird, and frequently the gaps between lines are far too long.  It's noticeably distracting.  The character animations are very basic and for the most part serviceable but feel very much like they weren't given enough attention.  Beyond the voice acting, sound design in general feels very flat and repetitive. Jonathon Blow's famous 1100 foot-step sound effects may be a bit overboard, but TCaE could have benefited from a little more variety.\n\nMajor Problems\nAll of the above could be patched with relative ease.  Re-recording the voice acting might be unlikely but it's doable.  This section are for the problems with TCaE that I'm not sure can be fixed.\n\nVoice control in this type of game is super novel and when it works well it feels incredible, but even when it's working perfectly it shines a light on maybe why this kind of thing hasn't been done so much in the past.  When you're in the middle of a hectic fire-fight it's really hard to remember the exact words you're supposed to say, speak them in a calm tone, and maintain situational awareness.  Being able to issue commands in an RTS effectively is always a bit of a challenge, and voice controls are and always will be, slower than pressing a macro key or clicking somewhere.  There are moments in the tutorial where the game slows down a bit for you to speak but that quickly goes away as you're thrown more or less into the fray.  You need to pause slightly between commands (which makes sense) but it's difficult to remember to do that when while you're in the middle of telling one character to move to a different location you notice that your other character needs to recharge their shields.  In TCaE it is very easy to become overwhelmed and it's frustrating when it happens because you feel like you're wrestling with the mechanic.  It takes you out of the game.\n\nThe camera movements requiring the mouse are frustrating but it's really frustrating when an enemy AI that's just off screen notices you and ruins your whole plan.  Making use of the "on my mark" command is great in these situations but it does tend to slow the game down which makes it all the more jarring when you're suddenly in a hectic firefight.  The enemy AI is, in general, "dumb" and "unfair".  It's basically easy to see and manipulate how and where they'll move and who they'll target but it's almost never clear if they can see you or not.  Ditto for your player characters.  I've orderd Corrin to fire on an enemy multiple times (he'll tell you "I'm on it Sam!") but I can see him just sitting there doing nothing.\n\nSome RTS games allow you to pause to take stock of the battle and maybe even queue up some commands. This is a great way of managing the pace while allowing scale to grow but in TCaE when you pause, an overlay menu appears obscuring everything, and of course the only interactions you're afforded when paused are to change game settings.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis review has run on a bit longer than I meant.  I hope you can tell that when I have a lot to say about a game it's because I want more from it.  TCaE is problematic.  It's buggy (which is frustrating but to be expected from a new developer), it's lacking polish, and it hasn't managed to convince me that voice controls are viable.  Maybe they should be an assist.  Maybe they just need to have more aliases for all the commands.  Maybe it just doesn't work.\n\nI recommend it for the experience and for the hope that it will get better. As it stands, There Came an Echo is new and interesting, but unfortunately it's not yet good.","February 24, 2015","true","1.2"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","14","26","0","0"

Its not the hardest game ever, although it isn't a walkover. And the tactical combat - the game's core - isn't as deep as other games, but if that is the only thing you are looking for then this is not the game for you.\n\nThe game is focused on 2 things - the story, and the controls. The easy one first - the story. It is an interesting story with lots of twists and turns, delivered through cutscenes (:/) and what the characters talk about during missions (:D). If you like story, I'd say this game delivers a concise, intersting one.\n\nThe main thing about this game? The voice control. For one thing, its much easier than using a keyboard/mouse, although I feel that is deliberate. The voice recognition is generally good, althouh didn't always pick me up. The commands are logical and clear and you can write your own, which is good, although I feel probably works best if you speak US English (my custom ones didn't really work with my UK english).\n\nThe voice control feels really cool though. Its combined with a logical, intuitive design - waypoints in good places, easily marked, distinct character names, distinct weapon names, and a good system for understanding you shorthand - for example, you can just say 'Corrin Alpha 4' to tell him to move there, and if you then said 'alpha 5' it would know you are still talking to the selected character.\n\nQueing up orders is also satisfying, allowing you to play out a planned manouver. You can que up multiple strings of orders, so you could give the first order to move people into positing, a second order to assign targets, and a third order you activate when their first targets are down etc.\n\nOverall, the control system does seem to work and do a good job, and realy makes the game special far more than anything else. The combat is solid but not extrodanary, the story is good, but the control system and gameplay it brings is great!","April 14, 2015","true","5.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I didn't put much thought in to it's purchase.  I glanced through the information, saw the name "Wil Wheaton" and my eyesight went a tad blurry.  Don't worry, I'm ok.  Tears of joy.  I had to buy this game.\n\nIf you're reading this Mr Wheaton, you are awesome.  If I saw a movie poster "Twilight: Now with Wil Wheaton" I would watch that movie.  If I saw a CD display "Justin Beiber: Wil Wheaton duets" I would buy that CD.  I eagerly await the day I can put a "Wil Wheaton 2024, Lightyears ahead in the Presidential race!" sign in my front yard.  So, yes, I bought this game.\n\nIt's a good game too.  Anyone remember the Full Spectrum Warrior games?  The combat reminds me of that.  You move your people around, give them simple commands, watch them shoot the bad guys, etc.  You don't have to tell them to shoot every time you want them to shoot.  You're more in to the big picture.  Setting up flanking, luring them in to ambushes, things like that.\n\nGraphics are decent.  Music is pretty good.  The voice actors are all good as well, real professional.  Gameplay is smooth.  UI (I'm using my mouse) works great.  Something this game really pushes is using your microphone to give all the orders to your people.  I haven't gotten a chance to try that out yet since my wife has been sleeping every time I've played this and I don't want to risk waking her.\n\nThe only real down side I'm finding is how quickly things fall apart sometimes.  You'll think you're doing great, then someone will go down while you're not aware and everyone else ends up flanked and you're done.  The game has checkpoints evenly spaced so this isn't too big of a deal.\n\nThat's about it I guess.  I'd give it a 9 out of 10.  Thanks for everyone that made it this far in the review.  I imagine many players bought it after reading the first 2 paragraphs involving Wil Wheaton.\n\n","April 13, 2015","true","4.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","2","3","5","0"

Not for it's strategic depth or crazy multiplayer, but because of the voice commands that allowed you to control troops around the field. After learning that There Came an Echo shared a similar control scheme, I was interested immediately. Having now completed the game, I'm more than happy to say I enjoyed my entire ride through. While the game is incredibly short, it holds a fantastically told story and a clever use of a health/stamina system.\n\nYou play Sam, a faceless character that plays a squad leader role to various teammates, the main named Corrin (voiced excellently by Wil Wheaton). Input is offered via voice commands, keyboard/mouse, controller, or a Intel RealSense device; the main selling point and my preferred method being through dictation.\n\nPros:\n+ Fantastic story. Extremely well told from beginning to end, with no true “meh” interludes.\n+ ♥♥♥♥ing incredible music. Just beautifully done throughout. The standout of the package without a doubt.\n+ Voice controls that work! I know some people have had trouble, but my accent was picked up without issues a large amount of the time. When I had trouble pronouncing names, or said key words the game didn't recognize, the game allowed typed-in custom words to be added.\n+ The health/stamina system was a fantastic balance. Power weapons will drain the shield that protects you from the damage you're receiving – do you continue to fire your average shots to keep health high, or switch to a power weapon at the risk of a fast death? Awesome design choice.\n+ A lot of awesome themes based on future technology and religion. A theme that is very easily understood and grasped while these complex ideas are being told.\n\nCons:\n- Grace's lines are really, really hard to enjoy. Her character was consistently infuriating and some lines were just so out of place and generally horrid. She has a major turn around towards the end of the game, but you'll never forget how bad it was before.\n- It ends. This is an incredibly short game, and once it's done, there isn't much to go back for. There is a training room to access, but it's one level of predictable waves of enemies. With the full realization this game was Kickstarted, it still really upsets me that there's no type of multiplayer/horde/level designer/Workshop to come with this game. I still want to continue playing, but I don't have anything to do.\n- Different missions have different (read: inconsistent and frustrating) levels of zoom. I really wanted to pull back the camera to get a more tactical view in some levels, but the game never budged. This made it very hard to get an idea of the battlefield at crucial points.\n\nI love this game. The short stay is a welcome one, and I can only hope the developers can squeeze in some extra levels or modding tools to help this game continue to thrive. Absolutely worth the asking price.","March 4, 2015","true","4.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

One time where i had a consistent problem was selecting the 4th  unit. Thankfully, it is possible to put in the command alias alternate names for the units and commands, so i nicknamed the unit Jack and everything flowed great after that.\n\nSomething else to take in mind is that it will be nigh impossible to play the game in a noisy environment since the voice commands will be riddled with noise. Also a standard quality microphone (not the 3 euro ones) will suffice.\n\nStorywise the game has a nice, kind of geeky but not too difficult to understand, compelling story with some interesting ties to the other game Iridium Studios has made, Sequence (renamed to Before the Echo, for legal reasons). It isn't necessary to have played it, since everything is explained, but if you have it's nice.\n\nThe voice acting is great, believable characters and dialogue. The music is also great too, made by Ronald Jenkees, someone i had never heard before but got in my radar with his exceptional music, also featured in Sequence (renamed to Before the Echo, for legal reasons).\n\nVoice command for English (US) for a non native speaker with almost no accent (me) is very responsive, provided that you speak in a calm way and with small pauses between commands.\n\nThe game features 4 weapons. The primary and always equipped one is the Pistol. The other 3 are unlocked as you play and have different unique abilities. A strategic  element is introduced in combat by the fact that apart form the pistol the other weapons drain your energy to use so you can't just equip the heavy hitter and blitz the game.\n\nThe story features 10 missions with a total duration of 4-6 hours.\nUnfortunately the main story doesn't have replayability since you have already seen it once.\nThere is however the War Room, a challenge of 12 waves of enemies to defeat with no healing between waves.\nAlso unfortunately, there isn't workshop integration with steam so no User Generated Content.\nThe achievements can be completed 100% though 1 or 2 are tricky to do.\n\nThe good thing is that the game has a good price tag at 15 euros.\nI recommend buying the game for both the story and the voice control mechanic, which is something very uncommon in video games.\n\nIf you have a comfortable living, 15 euros is a great price.\nIf your economics aren't very good and you are concerned over the short duration of the game then i suggest getting it at a sale further down the line, at 33%, maximum 50%. More than 50% price cut and you would be robbing the developer.\n\nFinal verdict: Very good game, worth the money.","April 7, 2015","true","10.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

From art, to voice work, to story; There Came an Echo exudes charm. Without spoiling anything, the story does seem a little odd, starting in the near future before graduating to some deep questions about identity, and self which I wouldn't have expected to find in a game.\n\nTechnically speaking, I think there were some things that could've been done better (for instance, a load check point option would've been nice as I found myself throwing my soldiers into walls of soldiers just to rewind quicker). The voice recognition kit's pretty solid, and the decision to limit movement to a preset check point system makes sense in this context, even if it is a little frustrating at times.\n\nTrying to run a tactics game in real time by voice is a challenge, and I found myself having to force a calm state if only to keep my commands clear. It's a great sensation and one that isn't usually found in most games where victory tends to go to those with the quickest reflexes and the most energy to detonate at the right moment.\n\nI think I would've liked this game more if it kept a step away from the metaphysical storyline, but that's not to say this was unwelcome. The pacing of the story is good, and ends early enough to not feel repetitive or dry. In short, recommend it highly, if only for the different experience of tactical squad command with your voice.","April 11, 2015","true","5.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

An Imperfect But Enjoyable Attempt At Pushing Barriers.Genre: Narrative Driven Voice-Controlled Isometric Squad Based Tactical Shooter.\nDeveloped & Published by: Iridium Studios\nPlatform: Windows only\nBusiness Model: Single Purchase + Optional Extras DLC\nCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade.[kingisaaclinksr.com]\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nThere Came An Echo is a squad based tactics game where the main gimmick is about controlling them with your own vocal commands. This three hour long campaign is fully voice acted and narrative driven. There’s really no reason to play it more than once so you’ll probably just get the three hours out of it. Still, I think it’s worth the asking and time price.  There’s also a simple battle arena for testing out the voice commands but that’s it as far as extra modes are concerned.\n\nVoice Command System and Strategy Talk\nThe voice command system is a pretty neat and certainly one of the better ones I’ve ever encountered. Being a tactical strategy game, you’ll have a depth of commands including moving units to certain spots on the maps, switching to one of three weapons and so on. There are even alternate commands and you can choose a single custom command for every character and action if you wish. However, it has it’s limits. You have to say the order the command phrase in the right way or it won’t acknowledge it. If you say the wrong thing or misstate an order, it doesn’t adaptively listen for the screw up. As such, it makes cancelling orders hit and miss. As far as responding to my voice, I’d say it did a reasonable job. I find that most voice recognition software has some difficulty understanding my voice due to how deep it is and my unfortunate ability to screw up phrases. However, I’m an Western Oregon accented male voice. It claims in the options menu it can handle different languages such as English in the UK, Australia and Canada all the way to Russian, Chinese and Japanese. But I don’t have any way of testing this. So, your mileage may vary. I haven’t seen or read any widespread complaints about it not handling other languages or accents, yet. If There Came An Echo does have problems understanding your voice, it’s entirely optional. You can control the game with mouse and keyboard but it’s definitely a lesser experience.\n\nNarrative Discussion (Spoilers)\nI don’t really know how I feel about the story. There’s a part of me that likes it. Likes that it was a sequel to the events of Before the Echo and that we get to see what happens with those characters. But then there’s the part that looks at the story and thinks it’s a bit of a jumbled and slightly rushed mess. It’s entertaining enough when you experience it for the first time but examining what the heck went on creates a lot of questions that aren’t answered. I’m not even really sure what the moral of the story is, but I guess that’s not surprising as Before the Echo’s moral point was pretty murky as well.\n\nPC Settings & Audio/Video\nThere Came An Echo comes with a good selection of PC options. Graphic options include screen resolutions up to 2715×1527 on my 16:9 monitor. Windowed mode is on/off (no borderless), V-Sync on/off, anti-aliasing 2-8X MSAA, Lights on/off and shadows low, med and high. There’s a setting for enabling 30FPS lock if you’re finding the framerate isn’t staying consistent. I can’t see any video settings that are missing. What few keys there are for this game can’t be rebound but it supports keyboard + mouse, PS4 and Xbox controllers. It also includes four separate audio sliders for master, effects, music and voice volumes. Voice sensitivity and language can also be changed here. There are some miscellaneous options for voice control including push to talk, sound dampen and so on.\n\nThe game is rather draining on resources I noticed which I found to be rather surprising. So, you may have to set some of the graphical options down depending on your setup. Most likely the Anti-aliasing setting. I didn’t experience any crashes or glitches during my playthrough. It has integration with Intel Realsense but I don’t own anything to test out that technology.\n\nVisually, the game has a colorful yet realistic Sci-Fi look to it. The colors on some levels can get rather overwhelming when there’s firefights going on but it otherwise looks consistent. The character models are pretty decently well detailed but the lip flaps don’t sync up with the talking. Overall, it looks good and consistent with the theme it has. The music is simply awesome. I had picked up the album on Bandcamp long before I had a chance to tackle the game and it’s great to listen to. It’s some of the best work Big Giant Circles, Malukah and Ronald Jenkees have ever done. Which is saying a lot considering their previous work. I could go on for hours how awesome it is to listen to but I won’t. Suffice it to say, it’s definitely one of my favorite videogame soundtracks of all time.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThere Came An Echo would be a threadbare tactics title if it didn’t have the voice command system. Instead, the gimmick makes the game worthy of your attention if for no other reason than it’s cool. Is it perfect? No, but it worked rather well for me and it was enjoyable ordering units around. Even if the strategy isn’t that deep, it’s deep enough to keep things interesting. I don’t really know how I feel about the story overall. I think it’s got enjoyable aspects to it such as the characters and the themes it attempts to present. But the short runtime and messy storytelling makes for a jumbled delivery. Still, I think it’s worth checking out.\n\nA Paladin's Review: Before The Echo.

The Writing is okay but don't expect any surprises in how the Characters interact with each other. The Story progresses quite linear though. No side Missions or such which keeps you focused on the Main Plot. Voice Actors are Wil Wheaton and Allie Brosh who was on TableTop and Spellslingers if you like these Shows.\n\nThe accent setting can be very tricky. As me being a German, the commands are often not recognized or misinterpreted and since there are only English Accents it can get frustrating, especially setting up Mark Orders. In General setting up Custom Commands that are easier to pronounce works sometimes.\n\nBut the huge Problem I have is a bug in the Mission 5 where the third Override won't trigger. The Crew just refuses to obey or react to it which is a Game Breaker in what feels like the Last Mission. There are also similar situations in other Missions where you need to get a certain Character to do a specific action which not always appears clear.","March 7, 2015","false","4.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Although I cannot fully recommend it because I personaly have sonme issues with it but i´ll explain later. This is an RTS in which you command a squad of 4 soldiers through a few missions using voice commands, yeah that´s right, you can play the entire game using only your voice (and mouse to move the camera) and it's just as awesome as it sounds, at least if the game responds to your commands and that's why I cannot recommend it to everyone, the game has a difficult time responding to accents, and although you can choose from different accents (Brittish, American, Canedian, Australian and Indian) in the menu to help the game reconising those commands better it does a poor job reconising commands I yel through the mic with my Dutch accent. From what I've read the devellopers will add support for other languages but in most cases Dutch isn't going to be one of them but they will probably add spanish, german and french and maybe a few other european languages. And even if they add Dutch the game probably still won't reconise English with a Dutch accent (Dutch sounds pretty cheesy in those kinds of games so I rather stick to english) after quite a long moment of calibrating the voice reconition system (or whatever it's called) i set the language to "English-Indian" because that one seems to work for the most part and after a bit of practice I did get the game to respond to most of my commands untill Syll becomes part of my team. I cannot command him to do anything AT ALL, unless i change the language to "English-United States" but when i do that the game doesn't respond when i use the word Alpha or the number 3 making it practicly impossible for me to go on. You can add custom commands and names so I tried giving Syll a custom name but so far no name I've tried seems to do the trick. furthermore I've had a lot of trouble commanding Corrin as he doesn't always respond to my commands and the game has difficulties reconising the word "mark" even though the command "Miranda, move to Alpha 2 on my mark" works perfectly fine. I've seen totalbiscuits video about this game and he doesn't have that much trouble at all so the game has problems with my accent and not with the commands themselfs. It is possible to play the game with mouse and keyboard but the game is too restricted to make it worth your while as you can only move your soldiers to pre selected points on the map, I don't think that's a big deal if you play using voice commands but if you can't the game is mediocre at best.\n\nI would reccomend the game if you have an Brittish, American, Canadian, Australian or Indian accent and if you have a microphone. If you're not a native English speaker there's no guarantee the game will work for you and since the game is pretty boring to play with mouse and keyboard you might want to stay away. If you are a native English speaker (and speak with one of the accents I listed above) then you should definitly give this game a shot. I won't give this game a rating because I don't feel like I've seen enough to give it a honest rating.\n","March 5, 2015","true","2.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","0"

SOCOM did something similar previously, but this takes to another level. The voice recognition requires some tweaking on your part, but also on teh devs part as many people are having hiccups. I found setting the mic vol to 50% and choosing low sensitivity allows you to speak more naturally without shouting, and if you shout the commands still register.\n\nThe soundtrack is absolutely brilliant and Big Giant Circles and Ronald Jenkess have come up trumps again. A mix of orchestral music, indie, and electronica. It really is out of this world. Seek out their other works.\n\nNow to the game itself. It's a fun ride, and your aim is to gradually gather 4 units under your control. The progression is gradual so you don't become too over whelemed by having too many units. You start with one, then two, then three and so on till you reach four units. The first few levels serve as training missions of sorts. It's the mid interval in the game that becomes more tactical and interesting.\n\nTo stop the player from getting lost, there are predefined routes that the units can follow. So a spot called Alpha 1 or a spot called Bravo 2. Shouting out Move to Bravo 2 suffices, though you can be longer in your command by combining with other commands. Such as "Corrin (the character you control) move to Alpha 1, Miranda (another unit) move to Bravo 2, on my mark. MARK". This sequence allows you to send two units simultaneously waiting for your say so to move.\n\nCombat is very much an automated affair, you do have some control, but you will always get hit. You can out flank the opponents by moving around the predefined spots, moving and grouping the enemy together so you can nade them. It's really clever and well executed. I like it beacuse even a casual can play this game and like an RTS and delve further, but it makes the whole process more engaging. I don't like RTS typically, but if there' smore like this, then I'll be hooked and find a new genre favourite.\n\nNow the bad bits. it's relatively short. This may matter but if time is your key to game fun, then this will flop for you. I dont care about these things, but your mileage may vary. The graphics are average at best, the 2d stylized work is great, but the 3d models leave a lot to be desired. I forgot the game was at final release, and assumed it was Early Access. Not so. It's great to see a complete game from time to time. Anyway, graphics are subpar at least. Sound wise it's great, the voice recognition can be hit or miss, but hit the sweet spot with the config and it's a winner.\n\nThe writing is also cheap and clumsy. It feels lazily written, but maybe story isn't important to the game. The only parts of the story I liked were at the mid interval stage again, the plot thickens, up until that point its a predestraian affair.\n\nI also didnt like the names under the characters in such big writing. It makes it look cheap and unpolished compared to the rest of the game.\n\nAgain none of these things matter to me, because the core gameplay is really sound. I would love to see a sequel with some online play, where only units you control are recognised by your voice, and vice versa.\n\nVoice commanding troops is a treat, I thought it would become tiresome, but it doesn't it engages you and encourages you to become more involved. The fact that you can add an alias to most commands, is great too. I changed the alias of the 4 units from their names to whiskey, scotch, bourbon and vodka.\n\nGood solid game, and fun, a bit on the rails I guess to some extent, but still enjoyable. And certainly not a failure.","February 26, 2015","true","2.9"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

The voice commands can be frustrating at times making you feel less like a commander and more like you're in an elementary school speaking class where everyone ignores you if you dont take the time to enunciate your words. The fact that the game is unfolding in real time makes it a real challenge at some points, which is welcome. Many times though, you need to begin command phrases ahead of time in order to compensate for slow reaction and processing time. TCAE does have a good story, however short, it really tells a neat tale of a futuristic society and weighs the impact of religion and technology and other social factors to being a deeper feeling to game. If it had been able to be expanded with more reactive voice control and more levels it would be a phenomminal $60 game on release. The pros of the shortness is it doesn't make itself overly difficult with the progrssion of levels. There are several stategies employed to keep the "Tell everyone what to do to win" mechanic fresh and interesting. With so few missions I was able to beat it in 3 hours and it didn't feel overly drawn out but it was an awesome enough experience that I felt that I wanted more. In the end, I feel that I would rather have a shorter game that doesn't let me get bored than a longer game that I'm dying on the inside after playing it so long I just want it to end. Either way, final conclusion, great game, would recommend, slightly strict voice commands and a few frame rate issues didn't hinder me from feeling this could be the start to something new and worthwhile in the gaming world and I'm happy I backed it on Kickstarter so long ago.","February 26, 2015","true","4.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The voice commands work surprisingly well (after a few patches), and the game actually feels like it benefits from using them rather than just being a pointless gimmick. You're encouraged to split members of your squad apart over fairly large maps, and the voice controls work well in controlling units far away or even off screen. Combine that with good writing, excellent music and art style, and you have another winner from Iridium Studios.","February 27, 2015","true","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm not responsible for creating anything specifically discussed below.*\n\nThere's nothing like There Came An Echo. At least not in my experience. I play games for a lot of reasons--satisfying gameplay, a good story, a comforting set of upgrades and achievements to collect--but one of my favorite things is a game that provides an utterly unique experience, one that is not otherwise possible in other games or in real life. I've never been a military commander, far from it. But There Came An Echo makes me feel like I'm part of the team, barking orders and trying to stay calm even as my troops wither under heavy fire. There's a lot to like about this game, from the gorgeous art to the thrilling soundtrack to the head-spinning depth of the story, but first and foremost for me is that feeling, that amazing, heart-pounding "Oh God how do I solve this" real-time tension. I'm not just a player pushing buttons on a controller, because there is no controller. There's just me and my voice, in the middle of the action and responsible on a gut level for what goes down in the next few minutes. That's great. That's very special.\n\nSurrounding and supporting that feeling at all times is a beautifully executed roller coaster experience. TCAE may be short, but it offers a rich emotional journey, a blockbuster sci-fi experience that brings on entertaining characters, sets them against great odds, and then lays their secrets bare, culminating in a sequence asking why we continue to strive even when things are at their most hopeless, even when everything tells you there's no point to continuing. In the end, TCAE isn't about the lasers or the *spoiler deleted* saucy robots *spoiler deleted* sous-chef *spoiler deleted* jazz saving the world. It's about how meaning doesn't come from outside, it comes from you and the people you care about, and how that caring is the fulcrum by which a lever might move the world.\n\nIt's been a frustrating experience for me, reading professional reviews of the game. TCAE doesn't really fit into the schematic of product reviews--x out of 10 for sound, y out of 10 for replayability, etc. In writing this review, I can't grade the art or the music for you; I can only tell you that some of the soundtrack has been stuck in my head for days, that the art is both functional and evocative, that both work together to express a cool and thrilling futurism. I can't assign to a number to the performances; I can only say that there are scenes of unexpected humor and others that cut painfully deep. I can tell you I will replay it, not as one returns to a game for DLC or bonus modes but as one returns to a movie, excited to see the story again.\n\nTCAE is an experience, a work of art as much as it is an entertainment, and it demands to be engaged with on an emotional and intellectual level as much as, or more, than the consumer perspective. Too often gamers are looking for the right number of pixels or a well-crafted Skinner box, so much so that they forget to just enjoy having fun. I know I'm as guilty of that as anyone. But those who find themselves in that situation would do well to spend an afternoon with Corrin and his friends, playing the way children do, ordering them to run here, do this, shoot that, win the day. If you're anything like me, the first time the characters talk back to you, you'll feel that spark of excitement that is, in the end, the reason we play games.","March 1, 2015","true","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Very good game, but also very short. Wouldn't recommend to pick up at anywhere above $10-12 . Also, if you're into game soundtracks, this one is very good.\n\nSo, There Came an Echo is a game that could stand to advertise itself better. It spent more time talking about having Wil Wheatley, Laura Bailey and Ashly Burch as VAs and its voice command gimmick than actually talking about what the game was about. I can get that it's impressive for a Kickstarter game to have all that, but still.\n\nIt's a very linear narrative-driven game, with gameplay along the lines of XCOM. You can use mouse or keyboard to order the troops around, but it's much more efficient to use the command system. The combat itself can get pretty hectic, but is very fixed and doesn't offer too much in the way of variety. More on that at the end. I've read complaints about the command system, but I didn't experience problems. It could be because my natural voice is loud enough that it would occasionally tell me I was being too loud, but still...I can't really fault it if I didn't have problems with it, but I guess be aware that some people have complained about it if you're soft spoken or don't naturally speak clearly? I don't know. I also did have a couple bugs here and there with characters not moving to the place I told them to (going to alpha one instead of alpha three), but I was generally able to work around them, so they weren't gamebreaking.\n\nThe story is the real draw here.The story itself is something you'll have to pay attention to, but it doesn't get so complicated you can't follow. The characters were simple, but effectively got their personalities across.The climax at the end was very well done. The writing was generally solid, but could occasionally be a bit too on-the-nose.\n\nAesthetic wise, what's up there is a good representation of it. The soundtrack is extremely good, and I'd recommend picking it up if you're into soundtrack collecting. I'd compare it to Mass Effect's music, very electronic and futuristic-sounding, if that makes sense.\n\nWith all that praise, it's a short game with little to no replayability. The story's the main draw and is linear, so no reason to replay there. Unlike XCOM, which I name-dropped earlier, there's also no variety in the gameplay, so that's also no reason to go on. It took me four hours to complete, and while they were a good and satisfying four hours, how much you're willing to pay will really come into it. So buyer beware.","February 28, 2015","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A lot of things happen during course of the game despite being short. There are some neat plot twists and characters themselves are well written. The user interface, logo, character portraits etc. all look nice.\n\nThe gameplay is not really deep. All of the missions are pretty short, but have some variety. There is little to no RNG going on, and you could technically burst through every mission if you know what you're doing.\n\nThe game is meant to be played with voice controls by saying commands. I don't have a headset, so I played the game with typical keyboard + mouse setup, and it worked just fine (except for few bugs).\n\nAfter each mission the game gives you a new gun and/or power-ups which allows minimal customization and feels rewarding, but sometimes the story gets in the way and you have to reset the mission, then equip your characters in a specific way in order to beat it.\n\nSummary:\n+ Voice acting is awesome.\n+ Story and characters are good.\n+ Character portraits are nice.\n+ Music is okay.\n+/- Ability to customize characters with different guns and power-ups, but sometimes you have to do certain set-ups as the story takes hold of the course who can go where.\n- Installs voice recognition libraries (for a lot of languages)  without user's permission, even if the user is unable to use them (either no microphone, unable to speak the language or inability to produce speech).\n- Game is slightly buggy (e.g: tried commanding Corrin to change his weapon into Charge Gun, then Miranda would also change into it despite me not wanting to. It only happens through the menu and when you have at least 3 members.\n- Installs video codec without user's permission.\n\nHours to beat: 6 hours or less. There doesn't seem to be a lot of replay value, unless you're going for all achievements or want to spend time in the War Room.\n\nI can only recommend this game for those who value story over gameplay.","February 27, 2015","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And that is where the game (at least for me) falls apart.\n\nI bought There Came an Echo to experience it the way it was advertised to me. Using voice recognition. There Came an Echo is ruined by their usage of what appears to be subpar voice recognition software. I speak fluent English and speak it almost daily at work.

Voice commands do not work reliably, with unrecognised commands resulting in "Val" telling you to "Speak up Sam..." which is fine the first half a dozen times, but really gets tired very VERY quickly, just adding to the frustration of using the interface. (They even make a joke of it in the beginning, where you can say "Shut up Val", to which she replies that she won't...)\n\nFine, so the voice commands don't work, what about mouse? Forgettaboutit. It's clunky, inaccurate and will often result in de-selecting characters and issue global orders - you'll go from thinking you're ordering one character to flank the enemy to seeing ALL your characters running straight past the enemy and getting the crap kicked out of them - which wouldn't matter, except you have a limited amount of energy for the mission which cannot be recouped. Which brings me on to the idea of shields and weapons sharing energy, something that *seems* interesting, but it just doesn't work, as it often means you're just hastening your demise, as the times you need it are when you're under the most pressure.\n\nI can't really comment on the story, as I can't get passed the 3rd misson on the default difficulty, because one of the characters *stops shooting as soon as you give her an order*. This results in losing 1/3 of your firepower, which just makes a difficult situation impossible. I'm a VERY experienced gamer; the difficulty curve on this is just too steep.\n\nThere also feels to be very little tactical about the game - your characters won't do what you tell them "that seems too dangerous to me"... even though they're getting hammered where they are (and they'll happily RUN STRAIGHT PAST the enemy if you tell them to)... and you're totally at the mercy of the map designers as to where you can move your guys... meaning that they'll sometime go to positions where they're perfect for being hit by area effect weapons and there's nothing you can do about it.\n\nOverall, it just doesn't work. It's got great ideas, but they just don't work in the real world.","February 26, 2015","false","3.5"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","8","18","2","0"

I found some elementa needlessly ambiguous, many people already dont like Will Wheaton, now in the game he is some sort of wonder creating super encryptions and hooking up with awesome people. That i did not enjoy. If i disregard that part and just focus on the game, its kind of enjoyable. Sure it doesnt have fancy graphics or out of this world soundtrack, but its different and unique and that counts for a lot. We need more imaginative games like that.\n\nActor work is impecable, with Jennifer Hale as lead role of a relentless and tough mercenary she does so well. Only hoping she´s going to voice Shepard 2.0 in ME4 gonna be glorious! Will does solid work aswell, outside of all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t his actor work is very believable its great to see all those years of acting paying off.\n\nNow the gameplay while novelty needs a bit of refining, i didnt like the stuttering in some places, like having my decisions questioned when we are operating on time. The PAUSE and MENU should be diferentiated aswell. I want to pause to observe the battlefield, to formulate my strategy, not to look at the menu.\n\nOverall its a differently paced experine with a lot of cutscenes like in any old FInal Fantasy game and a bit of fighting. Exectution isnt perfect, but its tolerable. I urge you to get this game not only to experience semi novelty gameplay, but to give the iridium games more of incentive to bring us more varied games like this.\n\nOverall a solid 6/10. Its not very enjoyable, but its DIFFERENT.","February 26, 2015","true","1.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I've backed quite a few games, and this easily sits up there among my favorites.\n\nThe main appeal of the game is to use voice controls, and it really delivers.  It's amazing how responsive it is to commands, and how liberating it was to be able to just look at the battlefield, sit back, and tell my people to move to positions, switch weapons, target specific people, etc.  This really shines on some later missions when you have to split your team up around the map, instead of the typical micro-managing of looking at each unit, issuing commands by clicks/keys.  It's a little tough to describe, but it's quite satisfying when you position your people, plan a coordinated attack, and execute it on your voice command, making you feel much more like a commander/coordinator than more traditional strategy games.\n\nYou can also customize the voice commands, so yes, you can say "Shut up Wesley!" (if you set the command)\n\nThere's also non-vocal controls, should you choose to go that route, or if you're unable to speak, but I didn't really try them out.\n\nMoving away from the voice stuff, here's some notes on the other aspects of the game:\n-great writing/story\n-excellent voice acting (I especially loved Val, voiced by Ashly Burch)\n-awesome music (I've listened to Big Giant Circles for a few years now)\n-nice art\n\nnote: it is pretty much a "one and done" experience, as there's not much incentive to replay the story, but I have no problem with that, given my experience in the game, and the price point.\n\nI finished the game in a little under 4 hours, and I feel that's completely fair at the price (I technically paid more as a backer).  I did express a desire for more content to the developers, but not because I didn't feel it was long enough, rather because I was really enjoying and getting into being the strategist for these people, especially in the last 2 or 3 missions.  It's fun.\n\nI'll end it with this...I think the most telling thing to say about my experience with There Came and Echo is the following anecdote:\n\nAt the risk of an obscure end-game spoiler, you're basically prompted to say a command to end the game.  Before saying the command, I sat in silence, looking at the characters, and then said "Goodbye" to my people.  I really wish they had responded, and I honestly think I felt a tear start to well up.  I didn't want to end it, but I begrudgingly said the command, and the game was over.","February 24, 2015","true","3.8"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","7","18","0","0"

I would give it an overall 8.5/10. Definitely worth checking out if you're into new styles of gameplay. This one utilizing voice commands.\n\nStory and Immersion (9/10):\nI liked how there were times where we could respond to the characters in the game to include us into the story, which made me feel more immersed into the story line since I was somewhat more involved in it. In other games, I usually find myself reaching for the skip cutscene button to watch all at once on the internet since I had no reason to care so much about it, espcially if I was just after good gameplay. It could have been improved on with choices affecting the game's direction where we could then go back and make different decisions, but I can see that a lot more would have to be developed into the game to make a strong incentive for the player want to go back to play the story again and again. Just including the player themselves right now and waiting for a vocal response was great.\n\nThe story was overall pretty interesting to see things change and the plot twists happen (don't want to spoil since the story is one of the strong points of the game).\n\nVoice Commands (10/10) and Gameplay (7.5/10):\nThe voice commands work extremely well (probably the only game where voice commands worked pretty much flawlessly for me). It's also pretty awesome that you can add extra words or intuitively say something similar to the default commands and they'd do just that. Much better than when I yelled FIREBALL FIREBALL PLZ ;-; FIREBAAAALLL in another game and yet nothing happened (it was still in development but don't know whatever happened to that game). They also tell you not to yell in this game if your mic is too loud.\n\nThe play through the story is pretty cool to see different scenarios and designs of the rooms that we fight in. I feel like some improvements could have been made to the combat or how missions could have been executed. There was, for example, one mission where have to do something stealthily. I think they could've utilized that system a bit more instead of putting players right into firefight combat on most missions. At the moment, it's possible to switch weapons according to the situation and just fire from cover in order to overcome almost all situations.\n\nI think adding environmental interactive weapons/items/effects and putting more of an emphasis on flanking would have improved the gameplay further. I think it would have also fit the game controls in that the object's name could become a keyword in the voice command.\n\nOverall a decent gameplay experience although a bit short (maybe for the better unless the combat and loadout progression system was improved upon).\n\nMusic and Audio (9.5/10):\nAbsolutely loved the music and effects in this game. They fit exactly the atmosphere of what happens at each point in the game and was brought forward enough to notice rather than having to take a step back from the gameplay and then finally hear that there was music in the background (that might be my own problem though). One of those you might find that you want the soundtrack for.\n\nGame Credits (10/10):\nAbsolutely great how they did the credits. I think it's a stern professional thing to have a cinematic or black screen with music playing while the credits are just rolling up the screen. But they would just be names with no special meaning to me. And, unless the cinematic or music is extremely godly, I always skipped them. Probably the first time I watched the credits from a video game from start to finish. It was great getting to know the faces and personalities of those behind the game.\n\nAt the end of the day...\nDefinitely a game worth checking out for the story, voice commands, and music. The combat is great at first however, it might not be exciting enough for players after playing for a few hours. But it is very interesting to use voice commands to control the characters in the game the first time you play. A game worth picking up when it is on sale if you are just after the game itself, but definitely worth supporting the people behind the game who are not just random names on the end credits thanks to their presentation at the end.","February 25, 2015","true","6.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

After playing I realize I was seriously selling this game short. Using voice commands can be a little difficult at times but it's extremely visceral. It does a great job of drawing you in and makes the whole thing more engrossing. I kept finding myself adding snarky one-liners to the dialogue which I was impressed with. Using your voice really brings you into the game, and it was funny how often I forgot the characters couldn't hear me. The voice acting is great and the writing is pretty dang good.\n\nMost of your tactical choices are pretty straight forward. Great for new-comers but a little on the bland side for veteren strategy gamers. Flanking is super effective and there are a number of alternate fire options you can equip your team with. You can also create a series of commands and have them carried out as you call out alpha numerics which is extremely impressive.\n\nThat said the game is short. Those 3.8 hrs up top are all it took for me to beat the game. I feel the price was fine but I wouldn't blame you for waiting for it to go on sale.\n\nAll in all if you have a mic and enjoy squad based RTS's I really think you should give this a try.","February 24, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

I had very few issues calling out commands and entering combat. If the command doesn't work the first time, it almost always picked up the second time. My only complaint about the voice commands was that sometimes I couldn't get the game to pick up newer character names that come up towards the end. But, luckily, the game lets you set your own character aliases! So you can give characters nicknames, of your choosing. Commands too! So if you want to yell rediculous words or phrases at your screen, even cursing, I can confirm it works brilliantly you dingus.\n\nGameplay is pretty good. Its an interesting top down real time strategy approach. You're given numbered locations you can move your characters to by calling out "Syll move to Alpha 5" and such. There is a variety of weaponry they can use and switch between on the fly that you're free to customize throughout the game inbetween missions. My only issue here is that some of the weapons feel arbitrary toward end game, you can bum rush practically anything. But objectives you need to complete hinder you so often it will be a poor idea so thats a good balance. Objectives may include leaving a man behind or splitting up to press seperate buttons.\n\nGameplay does get often interrupted by long cutscenes, and many of them in the beginning. Once you are about an hour into it you get much longer segments of gameplay and the scenes become well needed breaks. However, the game is short. You can beat it in about 5 hours or so, there are no optional objectives or rankings to be had so very little replayability is here. There is a "warroom" mode where you can spawn waves of enemies and practice with the voice controls, which is nice to show off. Personally, I did not mind the length of the game overall for the price I paid.\n\nThe story is exciting and very interesting. Its hard to discuss without spoilers, but it will be worth your time. Sometimes a bit confusing and perhaps cliche'd, the plot will probably make you want to see it to the end. Character performances by the likes of Whil Weaton are done great, and the writing is actually pretty funny. If you played Iridium's previous game, which I HIGHLY recommend - Sequence - you're already quite familiar with the writing which is a good thing.\n\nThe music is from Ronald Jenkees and Big Circles. Its AAA quality music in my opinion, really awesome tracks. I highly suggest getting the soundtrack even if you're not interested in the game, please do check it out.\n\nI did come across a bug or two which I took directly to the developers and they took care of it immediately! I had a patch within a few hours, but nothing was game breaking to begin with. I got from the beginning of the game to end credits without having to reset progress or anything like that. Do keep in mind, I've had issues with FRAPS on STEAM. FRAPS blocks achievements and STEAM from recording game time for some reason.

You follow a man named Corrin, a computer programmer who is thrust into an exciting adventure upon learning an evil organization is after his code.  The story takes many twists and turns and will usually be cohesive though at times it seems like some of the plot didn't make sense in light of later developments and unveilings in the story.\n\nThere is no multiplayer and the single player only took me 3 hours to complete.  I'd say this game offers very low replayability so you are banking on the idea that the quality and experience from the game is worth the money regardless of it's brevity, and in my opinion it is worth it.\n\nGo here to see a full video review on YouTube","February 24, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

Voice acting is great and you can really tell the quirks of each character through their dialogue. I was a little bit skeptical of the voice command system at first but settled into it quite well.

On the short side, but worth playing.\n\nThe basic appeal is undoubtedly the voice controls - I'd say not to bother if you're going to use more traditional control schemes. In my experience they were 100% responsive and intuitive once you understand how they work. They do a great job of making you a part of the universe; you play as a character sitting behind a screen shouting orders at the characters. If you have any interest at all in alternative control schemes and new approaches to interactivity, There Came an Echo is a must have.\n\nThe story is a bit on the convoluted side, but it's engaging with some well-defined and likable characters, who are definitely the best part of the narrative. Great designs, too - in fact, the artstyle in general is really appealing while remaining functional. The length of cutscenes is probably my biggest criticism, but considering the gameplay, there's no real alternative. Mixed feelings, but the game itself is paced well enough that I don't mind the story's issues.\n\nOverall, it feels fresh, and the new technology being utilized more than makes up for its non-gameplay issues. Again, it's short (about 4 hours of story with a bit more in additional missions), but there's no filler at all. Quality over quantity - but you might want to pick it up on sale.","March 31, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The voice command works better than any other voice recognition I've had the misfortune to interact with (to the point I actually enjoy the expirience) and the system works well. It is asthetically pleasing too- the isometric view is a good way to have the map and things like stratigic points makes for a streamlined expirience. My only complaint about the voice acting is less about the technical side of it (which is really well done) and more with the writing- the character development through antagonism ala Sly Cooper 1 can be grating. Wil Wheaton was, however, marvelous- it was almost like he was playing himself. I would have also liked the ability to skip cutscenes, given the writing. All in all, however, it is a great game.\n\nFor those on the edge, I'd also add this- for about half the price you can get a AAA title, you can get the game, the artbook, and the sountrack for a good price. My download also came with Sequence, though I'm not sure if that was a glitch or not. The game itself is long enough where the price point should have been 25$ alone. For what you get, you get a good amount of matirial.","March 14, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also I could use the voice commands 95% of the time despite the fact that I'm not a native English speaker. I like the idea of being a "commander" by just voice commands, but this is a feature you'll either like, or despise it; and as the mouse based controls are not intuitive and kinda hard to use, is a major factor.\n\nAs for the game, the 15€ price tag seems fair(maybe ~10€) to me, although it was a bit short IMO. The story is interesting, I like the visual style but you can decide just by looking at the pictures above, the voice acting is nice, the characters are well written I'd say. There's only one way to play the story, so once you're through, there's not much to do, there's a wave defense mode and that's it.\n\nThe only cons I can bring up, is if the combat gets a little chaotic you can't really react fast enough, cause the game won't understand you, and the countdown part, which have been mentioned in other reviews.","March 28, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The novel voice-controlled gameplay is surprising—not only in how well it works, but in how the act of speaking directly to characters helps bring them alive just a little bit more, in your mind.\n\nIt was a shame for me, though, that those characters didn't come across very well. The disembodied voice of Val was the most likeable by far, Farrick was interesting, and Miranda was a memorable hothead, yet I found the rest (through, I think, no fault of their performance) to be either basically unlikeable (see Grace and Corrin) or simply leaving not much impression at all (see Syll and Adam). I don't really know what to blame for this, though. Maybe it's too large a cast for such a short story, spreading each character's "screen time" too thin? I find it hard to say.\n\nI see a fair amount of reviews mentioning the voice recognition not working out for them, but I can say that it seemed flawless for me, and seemed wonderfully flexible when it comes to dealing with natural changes in speech patterns, stutters and last minute corrections and all those sorts of things that I'm used to seeing other speech recognition platforms get tangled up in. I thought it was impressive.\n\nWhile quite a short game with a story that's anything but novel, I think it's reasonable for its price, and most of all, an inspiring demonstration of one kind of control scheme that I think will be a prominent part of the near future in video games. One that would seem to pair quite well with the imminent eruption of VR.","March 21, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also not being able to zoom out far enough to see that there is 3 bad guys in the back shooting at you with charge guns really doesn't allow you to plan the combat out effectivly also not being able to place your own points they are predetermin by the game gives you limited choices. There is no take cover action like people would just stand there and take the hits please. Scatter should be another command. All in all it's an ok game for story line but combat and command issues make the game a great idea just not fully achieved.

Order your troops to move, focus fire and they'll do it.\nI will say, however, that the gameplay itself isn't where the fun factor of this game lies.\nIt's in the voice commanding.\n\nThe voice recognition in this game is good. Not perfect, but with a bit of patience, it works and works well. The story is well written and the voice actors did a great job.\nThe game does have additional content in the War Room feature, but you'll more than likely be satisfied with the Story mode. At least, I was.\n\nIf you're looking for a 4-hour experience of feeling awesome through the medium of voice commands, this game is well worth the asking price.","March 8, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A short game, but a good one. about 3-4 hours in total for a tenner. All in all not bad value, but not great either. Most of the entertainment comes from the voice command system, so it's a gimmick game. That said I can forgive gimmick games if the gimmick is done well.\n\nIn this case it mostly is. Commands work and are mostly logical, alternative words can be used for commands and selection too, giving you options for customization if there are words you have difficulty with. Does drop words every so often, but by far one of the better voice command systems I've used.\n\nThe setting and plot are both very tongue in cheek, kitschy cyberpunk. The plot is perfectly functional, but nothing special. The ending comes a little bit out of left field but hey, it's kitsch. At the end of the day I enjoyed it, it was nice to see a game that didn't seem to feel the need to take the plot too seriously, while still trying to deliver the best experience a decent-ish writing could. Would like more, it's mooreish in a popcorn sort of way.\n\nThe gameplay is a squad based RTS. Imagine a real time XCOM:EU battle and you've pretty much got the basic formula. You have up to four squad members and you can issue commands to, such as changing weapons moving to defined points on the map, targeting priority and so on.\n\nThe voice commands generate interesting tension as you can only give orders as fast as you can speak. As such the game rewards forward planning rather than just barrelling into hostile territory and making it up as you go. Crucially you can also stack commands to trigger when you say 'Mark'.\n\nEither way, the game gives you plenty of tools to get the job done and provides an interesting variety of levels to play them across.\n\nAt £10.99 I think it's a little steep for the short length but it's certainly one to consider when on sale. I'd say I got my money's worth but I'd also say I'd be lying if I didn't feel a little short changed at the same time.\n\nThe game can be controlled normally, but really if you do that you're paying for a sub par, very short XCOM clone. Which is telling of how well done I think the voice commands gimmick is.\n\nAll in all, pretty solid game, but a tad overpriced I feel.","March 9, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You might find that the game has trouble recognizing certain sounds that you make - fortunately, you can implement custom commands for everything in the game, which is both useful and hilarious. Once I aliased a few troublesome commands I had no problems with the voice system, and it really is something unique that totally changes the feel of the game. You have to learn to stay calm even when the situation is changing for the worse and you want to panic. There are a few neat touches regarding the voice system which I won't spoil here. There's a lot of mission variety which is great but it never went quite as deep as I might have liked - perhaps there will be some extra missions coming? The AI is pretty impressive and reacts smartly to your maneuvers. The campaign is short and sweet, which is exactly how I like it.\n\nOverall: Strongly recommended.","March 5, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have to use proper words here...Here we go\n\nThere came an echo is a game about using your mic to control 4 squadmembers (Using the mouse is possible but very difficult so make sure you have a decent mic) You use commands such as "Move to alpha 2" Amoung other things to move your squad around the map and commands such as "Open fire" Or "♥♥♥♥ up" As i made my custom to order your units to fire on certain enemies. Now the voice control is great like really great...But when it screws up...It screws up baaaad it will constantly mishear you and you may lose a mission due to random "Everyone in your squad suddenly going deaf" As i like to call it.\n\nNow then the story dont wanna give too many spoilers so i shall just say some ♥♥♥♥ that i can remember. Some dude made a code that is uncrackable someone else wants the code and some company thing can remake people after death and some woman wants it so she can bring back her dead sons (The rest would be spoiling too much)\n\nNow who are you?...Your "Sam" Clever they give a multi gender name as your not given much detail as to who the hell You are people just say your name occasionally and ignore you completely in cutscenes (As to be expected) But i feel like i should be able to do something during cutscenes...Or at least affect the story somehow...What im saying is CHOICES...It would have been so cool to be able to intervine during cutscenes and affect the path of the story....But you just order people around and ♥♥♥♥. There is one choice near the end and its a "Yes" or a "No" As far as I k-no-w...That was terrible...Sorry back on track. They both lead to the same outcome.\n\nNow the game has a badass factor that is for sure...Feeling like you are actually controlling them with your voice and stuff feels real badass but that wears off a little after a while.\n\nIn the end...I give this game...6 nobles outta 10 its good dont get me wrong...But i wanna feel like im doing more than ordering a bunch of people around...I wanna affect the story more than a "Yes" Or a "No" but if your in it for the gameplay rather than story and stuff...Then this game is worth it...If your here for a story you can affect and change...Then this game...Can still be slightly fun story wise...But slightly lacking.","March 4, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can say that my English language is very good, possibly excellent even but I do have an accent. And that means that I did have some problems playing the game. But still, I find the experience to be quite an enjoyable one.\n\nFor me this game is an experiment. I like this new concept, and I hope more things like this will come. But it's not without flaws. If you can't appreciate the novelty of the approach this game takes, than it's probably not for you.\n\nStoryline - quite good. A game is a bit short tho' and it could have used more character development, but still I found it enjoyable and smart. Dialogues are well written, they don't seem unrealistic, and characters never did anything that made me scream at the screen, which is nice for a change (some games suffer from scripted idiocy when game takes control of your character. This game is not one of those)\n\nVoice acting  - superb! I want more of it. Even tho' I'm not a huge fan of Will Wheaton (you could even say his face annoys the hell outta me) I still enjoyed even his voice acting very much. Ashly Burch (Val) was especially amazing.\n\nMissions/gameplay  - a bit buggy from time to time. Sometimes even with perfect voice recognition they play out clumsily. Your characters can get shot at during cutscenes. Not the best experience ever, but still was kinda fun. Game is definitely too short tho. Also, I've kept getting one and the same message between missions, and only at the very end was I informed that telling my guys to hold fire would get them into the cover. Jeeez. I could have used that information a bit earlier into the game. Anyway, tutorial is OK but not good enough.\n\nSo, all in all, if you want to play a game that is not like anything you've tried before, and can enjoy story aspect of the game without getting too frustrated about thing not going perfectly smoothly all the time and some of the missions being a tad bit annoying - you will like this game.\nIf you're here for perfect tactical squad-level combat simulation - you'll be disappointed.\n\nAlso, if you're not a native speaker be prepared for an added layer of difficulty :D Giving aliases to character and weapons helped me a lot, just choose something very easy to distinguish. I ended up calling "Syl" - "Sebastian" and "Grace" - "Jezebel" xD I found that longer names give less margin for error.","March 17, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, the voice controls were simply too spotty for me to have a complete play experince. As former soldier the concept of a game wherein I could take interactive tactical command of a squad was dream come true, watching my soldiers die time after time, when failing to hear my orders turned this into a nightmare.\n\nI am sure that my headset was simply not good enoungh for the game to pull accuarate commands, I was using the standard headphones and mic that come with the iphone. Now I know alot of people may say that I was an idoit for thinking that this would be sufficent to play this game with, however I have been using them with Rosetta Stone to speak Korean without any issues thus I honestly feel that short english phrases shouldnt be beyond their scope of limitations.\nIm aware that the game can be played without voice commands but honestly I feel as though that removes the game's biggest draw.  I cant give a positive reccomendation here, maybe most PC gamers have the setup required to run this, for someone who doesnt play online and thus doesnt have a high end headset I simply cant justifiy buying a new acessory for one game.\n\n\nTLDR: Awesome game when the voice commands worked, biggest draw is defeated when they dont.

The game can however be controlled wihout voice but the radial command setup while getting the job done can cause incorrect commands to be entered at times which can frustrate at crucial moments.\n\nThe game is entirely story driven and overall I would say that its a good one, strong characters backed up with good voice acting keeps you interested in its story which has some interesting revelations along the way lets say. Additionally due to the small focused character pool and as mentioned voice acting you do come to understand each character fairly well in the short time you have but as always this could have been expanded upon.\n\nWith regards to the games length game after a few mission retries it holds up to around 3-4 hours gameplay and while this may disappoint, I sometimes find that a relatively short but focused story can be really good at least most will get to experience the full game even with little game time to spare.\n\nOverall while due its length you may find it not be worth its full price of admission, being able to support a small indie studio like Iridium Studios with this games willingness to experiment with voice controls which granted has been done before it does bode well for future development of this gameplay method.\n\nI recommend this game to those looking for a story driven voice controlled strategy game with an interesting setting that at times when using the voice system really does make you think and I look forward to what Iridium Studios develops next.\n\nP.S\n-Voice command system does allow for voice commands to be edited to your preferences character names etc.\n-Use Right click to provide commands without voice for some reason It took me a while to figure this out and I can't remember this being pointed out.","January 2","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But as a whole I just can't recommend it to most other people.\n\nPros:\n+ There's a handful of incredibly cool moments, when everything comes together.\n+ The voice controls worked perfectly for me (though many people had different experiences).\n+ Playing a strategy game with voice controls is not just a gimmick--it is a cool concept and it's fun to do.\n+ The voice cast did an excellent job considering what they were given. Especially Ashly Burch!\n+ The game is a good length, for what it is. It's short (4 hours or so), and doesn't overstay its welcome.\n\nCons:\n- The stealth sections were painful, and clashed sharply with the innate imprecision of voice controls.\n- There are bugs. Restarting at checkpoints (on death) was unreliable, and missions got stuck and needed restarts.\n- UI clarity could have been a lot better: at some points (especially early on) it can be difficult to tell what to do.\n- Map design could have been much better: the fixed waypoints are needed, but offer too few options.\n- The dialogue is very cringe-worthy. Not even this very talented voice cast could save it.\n- The plot of this "story-driven" game is just completely all-over-the-place bananas, and not in a good way.\n\nA little more about the writing (as much as I can, without spoilers):\n\nBasically this game's main interest, story-wise, is in taking on high-minded philosophical concepts. Most full-length stories can only swallow one of these brain-devouring ideas before they get full; this game tries to take on like three or four of them at once, and the result is that it's basically incomprehensible.\n\nI don't mean that it's confusing, or too smart for the average gamer, or anything like that. The individual concepts are actually easy to understand. I mean that the story is composed of so many disparate, out-there elements that it does not form a whole that makes any sort of sense.\n\nI normally love deep philosophical stuff in stories, so when other reviewers complained about the story, I figured it wouldn't bother me. I was wrong. The story in this game is not intellectually challenging--it is a hodgepodge of pseudointellectualism that tries very hard to be clever, and mostly falls flat on its face. And while the game itself is pretty well-paced, the story writing is so rushed and so pointlessly convoluted that by the end I genuinely did not understand what my player-character was trying to accomplish anymore.\n\nI feel bad being so harsh. The writer also directed, edited, voice acted (pretty well!), and on the whole birthed the idea for this game from scratch. That's great, and I respect it a lot! But in the future I hope he will hire a dedicated writer who can help him to realize his vision in the way it deserves to be realized.\n\nTL;DR: Buy this game on sale if you are a native English speaker, curious about the voice-control concept, patient about bugs and sometimes-wonky design, forgiving of totally-bonkers story writing, and want to support a unique indie developer. Otherwise, steer clear.","July 1, 2015","false","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, the end product is not there at all.\n\nThere Came An Echo is a voice controlled Sci-Fi RTS with a big emphasis on story. Sadly a lot of that statement pinpoints the game's downfall. The voice controls seem so sick in theory but in execution just barely miss the bar, even the slightest of unresponsiveness leads to total frustration. The RTS elements are rather sparce with the only real tactical  choices being when to use or when to dodge the AoE gun. And finally, the story is hot garbage.\n\nThere are some very redeemable qualities to TCAE, the voice cast is above average with some serious powerhouse preformances by Ashly Burch and Laura Bailey. The music (although a little overshadowed in the production) is to die for and one of the best parts of the game. I cannot recommend this game's OST enough, it is worth every penny. While the voice controls are problematic, when they do work it does feel very awesome. Sadly an inconsistant control scheme can only be praised so much.\n\nThe true meat of the issue and the big reason to avoid the game is the story. Whoever else on this site tells you that the story is good is either confused or lying, the story is one of the biggest messes I've seen in recent memory. The script tries way to hard to be quick and witty and ends up bowling over key plot points and details, characters are often not introduced correctly and sometimes not given motivations until it's too late. The amount of plotholes and unanswered questions are staggering, I detail in my video review the multiple questions I had with the game's plot thoughout playing it AND this was after watching my footage multiple times to prepare for the review. By the end of the game the most sour taste will be left in your mouth after the storyline just dies and you realize the game was only 4 hours long.\n\nI applaud the innovative game and the fantastic soundtrack but it is very, very hard to recommend playing There Came An Echo. Here's hoping their next game fares better\n\nPros:\n- Absolultly sinister soundtrack\n- Great artistic design and color scheme\n- When the controls work, they feel quite cool\n- Above average voice cast with many star-studded preformances\n\nCons:\n- One of the most horribly executed stories I've seen\n- Unreliable control scheme, leading to frustration\n- Character models and animations look a tad dated\n- Did I mention how bad the story is?\n- Game is only 4 hours long, with a LARGE part of it being cutscenes\n- RTS elements are sparce and rather banal\n- I'm not trying to be funny here, avoid this story\n\nFor further in-depth breakdown of the game and the game's story, please check out my video review linked within this reivew.\n\n- Mr. u Suk","July 5, 2015","false","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game can however be controlled wihout voice but the radial command setup while getting the job done can cause incorrect commands to be entered at times which can frustrate at crucial moments.\n\nThe game is entirely story driven and overall I would say that its a good one, strong characters backed up with good voice acting keeps you interested in its story which has some interesting revelations along the way lets say. Additionally due to the small focused character pool and as mentioned voice acting you do come to understand each character fairly well in the short time you have but as always this could have been expanded upon.\n\nWith regards to the games length game after a few mission retries it holds up to around 3-4 hours gameplay and while this may disappoint, I sometimes find that a relatively short but focused story can be really good at least most will get to experience the full game even with little game time to spare.\n\nOverall while due its length you may find it not be worth its full price of admission, being able to support a small indie studio like Iridium Studios with this games willingness to experiment with voice controls which granted has been done before it does bode well for future development of this gameplay method.\n\nI recommend this game to those looking for a story driven voice controlled strategy game with an interesting setting that at times when using the voice system really does make you think and I look forward to what Iridium Studios develops next.\n\nP.S\n-Voice command system does allow for voice commands to be edited to your preferences character names etc.\n-Use Right click to provide commands without voice for some reason It took me a while to figure this out and I can't remember this being pointed out.","January 2","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although cool, the voice commands only restrict the amount of actual control you have, making the gameplay and strategy fairly shallow. At the default difficulty level, gameplay was limited to equipping the right weapons, charging in, and waiting for the fight to end. More complicated or dynamic strategy as fights progress could have been interesting, but simply isn't feasible with the voice command's reliability. Furthermore, there simply is not enough time, nor motivation, to become adept at strategy and rapidly issuing commands within the duration of the game. Needless to say, there is also little to no replay value.\n\nIt's pretty, the music and voice are phenomenal, and I applaud the exploration of unconventional approaches to user input... but as a game, it simply wasn't a whole lot of fun.","December 26, 2015","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I get the impression that this Iridium Studios guy is really passionate about his work, and he's really into improving himself and his games.\n\nThe voice command gameplay is fun, intuitive, and knows who you are right out of the box. I never had any problems with calibration despite using a crappy $2 budget desktop mic. This "Do X on my mark" is so good. The story puts you in the eyes of the commander role and tells the story from your point of view. It's not exactly natural, but it's refreshing and well-implemented. Visual effects immerse you in your role in the story in masterful ways (Though I can't tell you how without gameplay spoilers HEEEEEUGH.)\n\nReverences:\nThe Philosophy\nIf you cut and paste a file, is the original gone? If we can't go back in time, does that mean that our past selves are dead? Why do we fear disappearing? The atheist's dilemma.\nOn My Mark\nThe programming\nI can't say this enough. This game WORKS. It's not complicated, or flashy. There aren't a lot of pickups or upgrades, it is just perfect. I have not encountered a single bug. My game has not crashed or run slow. It works. It works. Complicated selection and voice commands work very well. For example, if two characters are next to an objective and you say "<one> and <two>: Execute special action" They will each execute the objective closest to them, even if they're close together. Whether it's because a lot of work went into anticipating all possible user input or because the coding is clean, it just works.\nGrievances:\nThe Writing\nLike most of these kind of games, the writing suffers. It feels forced, and though it's a lot better than the writings from Sequence, it's still full of memes. It feels like you're being hit over the head with whatever stereotype the game has for that character. Several plot elements are jerky and inconsistent, giving the impression that you're being yanked from one scene or story to the next without much context. The ending seems forced and contrived: there could be a lot more content there.\nManual Controls\nI tried out the keyboard-and-mouse controls because at one point I thought increasing the speed of ordering units might increase my chances of success after failing a few times. Unfortunately, the manual controls are awful. It tries to be context-based interaction-wheel style, but in practice it's clunky and your camera freezes in place while the interaction dialog is open. It also takes several seconds to confirm a command, made slower by the fact that your co-commander issues the order once you prepare it with the context wheel. That is a rather nice touch, though.\nGeneral Display Issues\nAt one point, you are required to perform an action regularly, or you'll fail the mission. This mission is coded very well, and is perhaps the best and my most favorite. However, your camera is not localized on the countdown. When you're looking at other places on the map, there could at least be a reminder icon in the corner of your screen.\nUseless red herrings","January 11","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not complicated, or flashy. There aren't a lot of pickups or upgrades, it is just perfect. I have not encountered a single bug. My game has not crashed or run slow. It works. It works. Complicated selection and voice commands work very well. For example, if two characters are next to an objective and you say "<one> and <two>: Execute special action" They will each execute the objective closest to them, even if they're close together. Whether it's because a lot of work went into anticipating all possible user input or because the coding is clean, it just works.\nGrievances:\nThe Writing\nLike most of these kind of games, the writing suffers. It feels forced, and though it's a lot better than the writings from Sequence, it's still full of memes. It feels like you're being hit over the head with whatever stereotype the game has for that character. Several plot elements are jerky and inconsistent, giving the impression that you're being yanked from one scene or story to the next without much context. The ending seems forced and contrived: there could be a lot more content there.\nManual Controls\nI tried out the keyboard-and-mouse controls because at one point I thought increasing the speed of ordering units might increase my chances of success after failing a few times. Unfortunately, the manual controls are awful. It tries to be context-based interaction-wheel style, but in practice it's clunky and your camera freezes in place while the interaction dialog is open. It also takes several seconds to confirm a command, made slower by the fact that your co-commander issues the order once you prepare it with the context wheel. That is a rather nice touch, though.\nGeneral Display Issues\nAt one point, you are required to perform an action regularly, or you'll fail the mission. This mission is coded very well, and is perhaps the best and my most favorite. However, your camera is not localized on the countdown. When you're looking at other places on the map, there could at least be a reminder icon in the corner of your screen.\nUseless red herrings","January 11","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
