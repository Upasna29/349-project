I sat down to write this review for Dead Horde the top down, run and gun shooter from DNS development, but I had a tough timeplaying this game for the 18 hours I put in to get 100% completion. Iit's not that the game has complex themes of survival that are hard to sum up or anything like that, it's just that it's such a boring paint by the numbers experience that I often had trouble remembering just what happened during my time with the game.\n\nFrom blockbusters like Dead Rising and Left 4 Dead to indie darlings like I made a game with zomb1es 1n it!!!, there are a lot of zombie games on the market, and you're going to have a hard time finding one as bad as Dead Horde. It's predictable, has no personality and does nothing that the...excuse the term...hordes of zombie games has done before it.\n\nDead Horde places you as one of the lone survivors of a zombie apocalypse and your job; your only job is to shoot and blow up as many zombies as you can to survive. Sound familiar? Dead Horde employs a top down view that finds you holding down one button to shoot and another to move forward and that's it. Sound familiar? It should. It's all been done before in games like Zombie Apocalypse and I made a game with zomb1es 1n it!!!, but the key is that those games did something to inject the formula with a novel feeling. Zombie Apocalypse for example featured four player co-op (as opposed to 2 player here) and I made a game with zomb1es 1n it!!! was just plain silly, here we get none of that.\n\nAnd there we have the key problem with Dead Horde. It's obvious that the developers have played the key zombie shooters of this generation and have lumped all of their key features into their game. For instance there's an almost carbon copy of Left 4 Dead's Boomer in the game. It's a pretty widely accepted fact in the gaming industry that the zombie shooter is a dated and stale genre and it's titles like these that offer absolutely no new ideas that are the perfect example of that.\n\nThroughout Dead Horde you'll gain the option to upgrade weapons at certain points and while it's a cool addition, in reality it does nothing for the gameplay. All of the weapons feel the same and lead to the feeling of merely grinding through each section from beginning to end. There's no real reason to explore, and you'll find yourself holding down two buttons and moving in one straightforward direction (well, except when you'll have to back pedal from enemies). You know, it's funny - I never thought that the zombie apocalypse would be this boring.\n\nIf Dead Horde had a saving factor it would be the vehicle sections which do tend to offer a break from the monotony of the game. It's quite fun to mow down the undead in a jeep or utility truck - the first few times, but when it happens again and again, it loses its appeal quickly. It's also important to note that the vehicle controls never really feel as tight as they should, and they often feel like you can't get control no matter what you do.\n\nYou've already played Dead Horde, even if you've never touched the game - it's all of your favorite parts from all of your favorite zombie games, only here they aren't done as well and have no personality. Dead Horde is an obvious attempt to grab a piece of a large yet dwindling audience. There are a ton of great zombie shooters on the market; hell there are a lot of competent zombie shooters on the market, why choose this one?","November 29, 2013","false","18.3"," 136 of 157 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","136","157","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pointnclickster/recommended/27940/","pointnclickster","Pointnclickster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pointnclickster/","315 products in account","When I first reviewed this game a year ago with a negative rating, I had not beaten it. Now that I have beaten it, I would like to still give it a negative rating but thoroughly explain why.\n\nFirst off, the price tag is wrong. This game should be in the $5 bin. I don't say that because the lack of story (you don't play a game like this for story), or for the graphics (I don't mind the old look, I rather like it.). This game is literally a one trick pony. In each level you fight zombie runners. Lots of them. Mobs. Oh, and they are just as fast as you. A zombie is as fast as a living trained soldier. Yeah, makes no sense, but it sure makes the game unforgiving and just plain stressful to play.\n\nThe look of the game is rather dark. The levels are huge, and within each level you work your way from checkpoint to checkpoint, clearing zombies until you reach the end of the level. One of the major issues is that the levels are fairly long, and there is no save option. Even though the game saves the checkpoint, it only saves it while you are in game. If you leave the game, you will have to restart the whole level over again.\n\nThe controls are very simple and I had no trouble playing the game. The dodge button is your friend, since you cannot outrrun the zombies. The sound effects and soundtrack left something to be desired, since only one song plays briefly when a horde rushes you. I really wish they could have come up with a few more tracks to change it up, but oh well.\n\nNow to fight zombies you need good guns. You start off with an Assault Rifle with unlimited ammo. This serves to be your primary gun. There are stores scattered amongst the levels so you can buy upgrades for your gun and buy new guns, such as a Shotgun, Rocket Launcher, a Lightning Gun, and a Minigun. There are also different kinds of grenades to purchase. The major damage weapons don't appear until near the end of the game. This game is so difficult that honestly the upgrades are not too noticeable.\n\nThe "mutants" of this game are identical to the ones from Left 4 Dead, with the exception that there are no witches. So imagine the runners of Left 4 Dead with the mutants and thats who you fight, with little to no variance. Just zombie mobs. For every walker, there are at least 100 runners coming at you. I'm honestly scared to see how this plays on Normal difficulty. As you kill zombies, you earn money and sometimes health packs are dropped if you need healing.\n\nHonestly, the whole time I was playing this game, I kept thinking about how great the games Zombie Shooter and Zombie Shooter 2 are. They are basic zombie shooters (soldier trying to stop a zombie virus), but it has RPG elements, like choosing stats for your hero (male of female). Not only that but you can pick fun perks that enhance your character. You get to buy guns and equipment to help in your missions. The soundtrack is great, a pumping techno/rock mix that is just great for killing zombies. The games definitely have more of an arcade look to them, but the level design is a lot more interesting then Dead Horde. Plus, you can get Zombie Shooter 1 and 2 for the price of Dead Horde (if you buy the two pack). Seriously, check those game out instead. There are even free demos so check it out. I wish Dead Horde would have had a demo, because that would have saved a lot of people's money.","March 30","false","10.3"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","22","24","0","3"

Not quite the Dead Nation that I was expecting! Maybe I was expecting too much... maybe not since Dead Nation is also an indie game...\n\nAside from the poor graphics and art style, my main concern with the game is the gameplay itself. The shooting kinda feels tedious as the weapons sound bland and have a low rate of fire. Also, killing bullet sponge zombies is just unsatisfying even when the weapons are upgraded to their fullest.\n\nThe most satisfying parts of the game are when you get the opportunity to drive armored vehicule as they allow you to take down hordes of zombies with a mounted machinegun. Unfortunately, the horde setup feels terribly uninspired as pack of zombies always appear after picking up ammo, money and health boxes laying on the ground.\n\nOverall, Dead Horde offers no sense of danger and terror that would come with a zombie outbreak setup. The lack of work on the environment makes every level generic at best. Not to mention the poor storyline which give no sense of progression.\n\nIf you want to play this game because you can't play Dead Nation on PS3 then restrain yourself and do everything you can to get a hold on Dead Nation. I'm dead serious.\n\nRating :\n4.0","July 1, 2015","false","9.3"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","24","28","2","0"

The view is third person like but with a little bit practise also first person shooter players will love it. You can play those games alone or with a coop-mate. If you have the possibility to use teamspeak, skype or steam-voicechat together it’s really fun (yeah sadly there is no voice communication in the game).\n\nYou can choose your weapon and with making money (from killing monsters or collecting) you can buy new weapons or you upgrate the once you have.\n\nThe enemies have different healthpoints and make different demage.

All characters "drift" instead of making proper turns, enabling you to get some cheeky circle moves in, completely defeating the AI, which seems to be the "run diectly at the player" variety... which is fine for a zombie game.\n\nThe Good:\n-This is a Zombie Shooter, and is fun in small bursts.\n-Once you adapt, the controll is very good.\n-It dosen't look that bad on lower settings, and runs fine on my toaster of a computer.\n-Enviroments are very well crafted, and some simple but nice puzzles\n\nThe Bad:\n-Seemingly little variety in enemies.\n-Game flips back and forth from mind-nummingly linear to "where the heck do I go now".\n-Small, repetitive selection of sound effects.\n-Some sound effects are played in ambiance, and then used to trigger doors and such.\n-Devoid of story,\n\nI love zombie games, but I wouldn't recommend this one.

It's severely hampered by bugs and poor gameplay mechanics.\n\nWhile the aforementioned potenial has it appear as a very good game on the surface and early game. Later game becomes annoying and hard for all the wrong reasons. There's bugs that prevent you from moving at times when absolutely nothing is blocking your path, attack animations are completely irrelevant as attacks will hit the moment the enemies start their animations and not when the attacks actually go through. Worse still, combat later game boils down to killing all the enemies before they get to the point they completely overrun you. The game also has an elevation system, but the combat does not compensate for being a higher elevation than your target.\n\nAll in all, this game is mediocre, and that's being extremely generous.\n\nIf you really want to get this game, wait for a sale.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/isaak_johnson/recommended/27940/","isaak_johnson","Isaak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/isaak_johnson/","476 products in account","Dead Horde could have been a good game with a larger development team and a lot more love, but it misses the bar in multiple categories and is at most a good time for a few hours, with moments of frustation due to poor gameplay.\n\nSummarizing combat, your character is slow, with all enemies being as fast as you or faster, your only way to gain distance is through a forward jumping roll, which feels unresponsive and will often get you snagged in a corner after a leap. Enemies make a straight line for you, and have no collission amongst themselves, making it very easy for all enemies to be able to damage you, which is often unavoidable.\n\nThe hoard cannot be pushed back or slowed down except for shooting them with your primary rifle, but they will still be faster than your ability to backpedal. Only one big zombie can be stunned through shooting him, and all the big zombies move much faster than you, often forcing you to tank their attacks when dealing with them on your first playthough.\n\nAll zombies, including the big ones, make no sounds when approaching you from off-screen, only making sounds when attacking, and being hit. This makes it very hard to respond to threats, and even with a watchful eye and good reflexes, you will often find yourself with a big zombie in your face before you can react, with no way for you to get distance from it.\n\nUsually your only defence against having to just tank the damage, is to have already done a playthough (or died), and know where the enemies are going to be, and when the waves spawn, and having a powerful weapon already prepped.\n\nThe difficulty curve is all over the place, with two mid-campain levels being very difficult and crampt, and the end of the game feeling underwhelming. The entire game is filled with poor level design, riddled with objects that completly block your view, spots that will snag on your character, and areas that you should be able to squeeze through, but instead block you.\n\nTo summarize, the game feels very cheaply made, and has that arcadey difficulty that only a cheap game can replicate. Don't buy Dead Horde for it's normal price of $9.99, get it when it's on sale or with a coupon for $1, even $2 is pushing it. However, after understanding it's many flaws, it can still be enjoyable and will help waste a few hours.

There are dozens of games that uses the same formula but on a much better level, some of them even free flash games!

Worst of all, it's boring, and I like top down shooter zombie games, but this is just bad. It's not satisfying to kill zombies, some of the 'special' zombies which are highly unoriginal by the way, really stand out and feel silly. The game has no tutorial to speak of, which could really be used since the way the shop works is just really really confusing. There's nothing really to redeem this game, it brings nothing new to the genre, it doesn't do anything well, and you'll honestly have more fun playing a simple FREE shooter made in flash or something.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/27940/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","VERDICT: Dead Horde is a barely average apocalypse themed twin-stick shooter with limited gameplay and dated graphics.  Most gamers will find gameplay too repetitve and frustrating.  Graphics are dull and the sounds basic.  It is remaniscent of 80s style video games.\n\nThe game relies on fast moving zombies/ mutants, ambushes and a sprinkling of bosses with unique abilities to create the overall challenge.  Bad pathing & line-of-sight, slight stuttering animations and slow controls can cause frustration. Leading to frequent mistake-induced insta-death.  That is until you get used to the mechanics.\n\nHowever its not all doom and gloom.  It has a nice amount of weapons and upgrades.  I had fun playing through it but only when I worked out the game machanics.  It definitely has its moments but ultimately there are better games of its type out there.\n\nIf you can overlook the gloomy graphics and the lack of manual save, and if you are a hardcore twin-stick shooter enthusiast you may find the difficulty that much more satisfying to overcome.  Otherwise I would recommended only if old-skool games appeal to you.  If you arent convinced then definitely look elsewhere for a better or modern variant.\n\n\n... More info below ...\n\n\n01. GENRE: Old/skool, budget, linear, 2.5D twin-stick shooter\n\n02. SETTING: Military themed mutant/zombie apocalypse\n\n03. STORY/BACKGROUND: Weve seen it before:  You are a soldier whose team was sent to investigate and stop a mutant infestation from taking hold in your area.  Seperated from your squad you must now single-handedly (or with teammate) make your way through each area crawling with fast-moving enemies, while avoiding ambushes in order to rejoin your comrades and continue the mission.  Along the way you earn cash to purchase weapons from a decent-sized arsenal and collect pick-ups to boost your ammo, cash and health.\n\n04. GAME MODES: One nine level campaign designed to be replayed four times with ramped up difficulty from easy to insane.  It has coop or single-player modes.  Had difficulty in finding a partner though.\n\n05. GAME/LEVEL DESIGN: Levels switch between linear corridored maps where you must get from A to B, to arena type zones where you must kill waves of progressively harder enemies.  Some levels are a combination of both.  There are a few sections where you can drive a vehicle, where you can slay mutants at will.  These were fun.  If only there were more of these sections!\n\nRange of design is limited if mixed up fairly well to compensate.  There is no manual save so once started a level must be completed.  Check-points allow you to restart if you die.  But if you quit the game this progress is lost.  Aggravating if you have had enough of dying and need a break!\n\n06. GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS: The basic dynamic is to move forward slowly.  Group of mutants are alerted by your presence.  It pays to be cautious as weapons only kill a few at a time.  Every so often ambushes are triggered by location.  Backpedal while shooting, move faster when running away or eventually get caught.  Roll-away periodically handy for getting out of trouble fast.  Trust me... you will be running back the way you came alot, alternating between backpedalling, running and rolling away.  Watch out for zombies that avoid your line-of-sight by running behind objects so they cant be seen until too late.\n\nIn terms of equipment you can buy ammo, weapons, grenades and upgrades periodically when you encounter a supply kiosk.  Weapons include: assault rifle, shotgun, frag nades, mines, buzzsaw, rocket launcher, minigun, lightning cannon and kids toy for distraction.  Each of these has a range of upgrades including: damage, clipsize, total ammo, and range.  These cost cash to buy. Cash is earned through killing enemies.  Moreso with limited pick-ups scattered around each level.  Pickups also include: health boosts and ammo recharge for all but your assault rifle which has unlimited ammo.\n\nYou die. Die and die.  Its one of those games where you need to learn and use the glitches to kill the bosses.  However if you perservere there is some decent gameplay to be found, even if after the second playthough it becomes repetitve.\n\n07. ENEMIES: There are only a few variations in the enemies faced.  They are all zombies or mutations thereof.  Each has their own strength of threat; the zombies tend to hunt in packs, some are faster than others and should be prioritized, The large bloats need a few clips emptied into them to avoid the green goo they vomit on the player.  Dont let the slashers get to close as they damage fast and hard.  While the leapers can jump from far and send waves of concussion towards the player if they get to close.\n\n08. A.I: The A.I. is super-heightened relying on the players proximity to zombies for them to activate and chase the For the most part the A.I. is simple yet effective.\n\n09. CONTROLS: Probably the worst part of the game (along with some of the animations).  They can be sluggish and annoying.  Frustratingly as so if and when you mess up you will get punished... badly on higher difficulties.\n\n10. GRAPHICS: Dated but well-drawn back in the day.  The range of environments, furniture and models is frankly better than alot of modern games.  Really keeps visuals interesting especially across levels.  Definitely a plus overal.  Resolution is limited to 1366x768.\n\n11. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO: Minimal.  A nice use of music when ambushes occur.  However sometimes these cut out and are truly ♥♥♥-♥♥♥♥ed by a group of mutants.  Not good!\n\n12. VOICE ACTING: There is none.  Likely due to its low-ish budget.  Frankly you wont miss it.  The story [what there is of it] is so short that you can glaze over the text in a few seconds between levels.\n\n13. CHALLENGE/DIFFICULTY: Borders from easy to very difficult.  Mostly due to the issues with controls and lack of smoothness in the animations.  Game relies on zombie speed being faster and able to outrun players for the most part.  Learning curve is okay but hard until mechanics are understood.  Had the hardest time on Normal learning how to and when to; move and dodge, and learning glitches to take down each type of zed in every situation.  Once you've got this nailed its just a question of applying them to encounters with more enemies.\n\n14. PROBLEMS: It plays well and is stable on my not so modern Core i3 PC.\n\n15. ACHIEVEMENTS: Most of the achievements you will get on your first playthrough.  100% completion will take some effort. Campaign must be completed on each difficulty level: easy, normal, hard and insane.  Afterall four you will still need to farm another 2000 or so kills for the hardest achievement.\n\n16. DLC: None.  If you want more there is a sequel of sorts called: Primal Fear.\n\n17. ONLINE PLAY/COMMUNITY: There is coop but after posting for some coop help I got no reply in over a week so you may be forced to play this singleplayer Im afraid.  Thats a shame because some of the youtube videos of coop play take the game to a different enjoyment level.\n\n18. ENJOYMENT/APPEAL: Will mostly appeal to hardcore twin-stick shooter lovers and/or fans of old-skool games.  Just dont expect much and you wont be disappointed.\n\n19. PLAYTIME/LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY:  It maybe short and you can complete the campaign in a few hours but the game is designed for at least four complete play-throughs and with a Coop partner Id imagine its a lot more fun.  If you are a casual gamer or not a big fan of twin-shooters you may be satisfied with only one or two tries.  Otherwise the challenge with each difficulty is there for hardened veterans of such games.\n\n20. VALUE FOR MONEY: I would suggest getting this in a sale.  Though its not far off being a good price for the content there is.","December 4, 2015","true","30.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

The CO-OP as so advertised is non existant. The server lists never load and i've downloaded every patch and update. The solo campaign is good however you dont get enough time in vehicles. The levels are quite repetitive. There is only so much strategy you can possibly have playing this game due to the repetitness. Therefore the campaign should be easier. Playing alone is really hard because youre running around with a pee shooting m16 that appearently is equivilant to a super soaker even fully upgraded. The other weapons you can buy and upgrade are few and far in between. You dont get much ammo and theyre very expensive. Not the best choice either. For some reason this is a survival zombie game however you cant walk through a gate until you kill every zombie in the area? There should be more zombies but much weaker. The different types of zombies are stupid and have that resident evil feel to them where theyre more "monsters" rather than zombies. Zombies cant possibly take thirty 7.62 rounds from an automatic m16a2 and still be running at you. The game seems to have a 3D effect however zombies get stuck on stairs. You cant walk up the majority of the stairs in the game and once your level changes you can only shoot at that level. So if you go to the second floor of a building and shoot out of the window you wont hit anything but air... With a little bit more effort this would be a great game but right now I wouldn't pay more than $2 for this game. The levels are veryyyyyyyyy longgggggggggg and repetitive and have automatic check points which are dumb and should be manual. The achievments are very easy to obtain except for the last 6 or 7 out of 28 which are impossible without a party of 4 or more which they dont offer considering the online lobbies are non existant. Nation Red looks like it would be a better game to play. Pretty much a disappointing game from a good company.","August 2, 2014","true","28.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It actually hurt my eyes after about 10 minutes of gameplay. The game sounds bad too. Prepare to hear only one audio for each weapon, and a really ear-destroyingly bad one at that. The weapons aren't stasifying to shoot, and the zombies aren't fun to kill. Its monotonous and grindy right from the get-go. The levels are linear and railroad you into killing all the zombies in each area with checkpoints that wont let you pass. It even fails in being an arcade-style shooter, too! A big score is shown at the top of the screen with a multiplier that increments as you kill enemies, but every time I got it higher (maxed mine out at x87) some faster-than-me enemy trolled it back down.\n\n2/10 For trying.","July 31, 2011","false","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Seriously, the operable vehicles are out-of-proportion with the rest of the game.\n\nSound quality is poor. The soundtrack is almost laughable--they could have made it so bad it's good, but instead they chose to rarely use music at all. That being said, you know you're about to run backward shooting a bunch of zombies whenever trashy techno bleeds out of your speakers.\n\nThat's the core gameplay mechanic. Run backwards shooting, then turn around and keep running while you wait 7 seconds to reload. Please don't interrupt the reload animation until you are certain you have a fresh mag, or your avatar will have to start over. There's also a jump button, kind of. Red barrels explode when you shoot them. Eventually.\n\nStill reloading. . .\n\nThere are different zombie types, but they don't change the gameplay the way they do in, say, any other zombie game.\n\nNone of the weapons are satisfying. You can upgrade the weapons, but I struggled to notice a difference in DPS or power. Yes, your assault rifle will shoot faster, but that just means you have to reload more often.\n\nThe game might be marginally improved if played via co-op, but it doesn't accomplish the twin-stick shooter feel that suits couch co-op so well. I never bothered, but I can imagine you get the benefit of seeing the reload animation twice as often, so BONUS!\n\nStill reloading. . .","April 28, 2014","false","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I had no issues with getting the game set up.  I did however not enjoy the game as much as i thought I would.  By the 4th level, I realized I had already seen every monster and the devs were good at creating levels but not gameplay/design.\n\nOverall it is an ok game that you upgrade weapons, kill zombies, and play Coop.  For me it just suffered from being repetative.  The entire game basically tries to cheese you by putting you in places and setting you in a trap.  Once I found this out, I just ran the direction I came every 30 yards and avoided the traps.\n\nThe char models move funny and the physics get wonky.  I don't want to sound like I am totally bashing the game, because its ok and decent.  However the pit falls made it less than ok or decent.

Would I pay $9.99 for it?  No.  But is it worth it on a Steam sale for $1 or $2?  Hell yea!  I grew up with shooters like this from Ikari Warriors, to Total Carnage and Smash TV, to console games like Reloaded so I know how games like this are supposed to be.\n\nWhat I did I like about the game?  I found the simplistic nature of the game very straightforward and basically a lot of fun.  It doesn't really boast anything more than it promises other than casual Zombie shooting.  I found it to actually be very similar in nature to games like Yet Another Zombie Defense.  It's fun, with progressing difficulty and power ups.  It's mindless fun entertainment that satisfies the need to kill zombies!!!\n\nWhat I didn't like about the game?  The horde music is repetitive and annoying at times so I just turned it down so it was barely audible so I could still hear when a large swam was attacking.  There wasn't a lot of variety of zombie types and why must every game after L4D have a fat zombie that vomits??  The game while visually simplistic seems to give low to mid end video cards a hard time.  I found that my ultrabook and XPS gaming laptop could barely play at medium/low settings while those same systems can play L4D2, CSGO and other graphically superior games without issue.  I even found a bit of stutter on a 4GHz i7 with a EVGA 680SC that plays BF4, WatchDogs, and Crysis 3 on ULTRA high settings with no effort.  The zombies are so fast that sometimes a large horde can overrun you even if you are running away and dive/rolling to get further distance.\n\nIt's a good game but to be a great game these glaring issues need to be resolved.","June 17, 2014","true","6.9"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

On the positive side, it supports widescreen format resolutions as well as the Steam Overlay.  The control scheme is a simple to learn point and click excercise that can be adapted to fairly easily.  Unfortunately I wonder if the developers decided to create a zombie title to cover for the fact that their is a terrible monster ai.  Much of the gameplay becomes an excercise of running backwards while firing at a stack of zombies that can only slightly run faster than your player character runs backwards.  In addition, the game lacks any sort of story that I see, even in campaign mode, and the ingame screens lack any sort of map.  The resulting experience is a linear Shadowgrounds or Alien Swarm with considerably less combat variety.

The models are very limited in animations which result in really weird looking movements. All the other things look fine though, so it's really distracting.\nAnyway, the idea is to move your character through a level, which consists of several sections (with checkpoints). You can't get to a new section without cleaning the current section first. During the game you'll be able to buy and upgrade new weapons to make things easier. There are also vehicles to move objects or run over zombies. But there's no real variation here in the end.

(At least for these kinds of games that I've played.)\n\nAfter only being able to make it 3 levels in. Here is what this game is. It's a Zombie game... That pretty much sums it up.\n\nStory is exactly like every other D-Movie zombie storyline. 100% you can skip. Nothing of interest to note.\n\nI'm pretty sure the store screenshots of the Graphics are a LIE! I was not able to get those graphics no matter what I did. The graphics are so choppy and glitchy it isn't even funny. You will have things blocking your view so you can't see your character or zombies. The shadows tend to glitch and stretch randomly at times. Textures are more plain and dull than Slender Man's face.\n\nThe camera is jumpy and laggy. I don't suffer from motion sickness, but oh my god. Moving the camera too fast made the camera jerky and jumpy so bad, I felt like throwing up. Adding in the terriable graphics and glitchy shadows, taking a knife to my eye sockets would have felt better.\n\nThe sounds in this game sound like they were recorded with a potato. They just sound horiable. The world also has a lack of sounds 99% of the time. There is only 1 music track in the entire game, and that's only when a "Horde" of zombies randomly spawn to mob you. I ended up muting the game and just have my own music playing... Even with that, this game SOMEHOW managed to make Foobar2000 fk up and repeat songs or skip parts of songs.\n\nThere isn't really an options menu to speak of. I've even had my key rebinds change randomly on me.\n\nThere is a coop mode in this game, but I could not get another poor basterd to play with me. But from what I hear, it's a "Same Screen" coop mode. That sounds lame.\n\nYeah the achievements are easy as fk, but I do NOT want to play through this game 4 times! Difficulty achievements do not stack, and Hard and Insane are locked untill you beat Normal and Hard.\n\nNo Steam Cards, for those people that care.\n\nI honestly don't remember where I bought this game or why. I would guess that I got it in a bundle of some kind, so I probably only spent <$1 on it. Either way, I do not recommend this game. Delete it like the rest.","April 16, 2015","false","1.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A good 90% of the itme that i see a game that says '\nDO NOT BAI! KTHNX!'... It usually turns out to be an at least DECENT title.\nBut this time around, their assessment was correct. This game is pretty bad. It's playable, the controls are smooth and everything. But iyts just so basic and the animations are so simple, theres tons of other options for zombie games with the exact same camera style that blow this out of the water. If you got it from a bundle as i did, then no loss. But if you're planning on buying this game for the price that is charged in the Steam store, please do yourself a huge favor and do NOT buy it.\nIf this game looks like its interesting to you, go ahead and go back to the main store page and search for the game 'How to Survive'... Because that game there, that game does what i expected this one to do.\n\non a scale of 1 though 10 i would rate this game at about 2/10. And thats being generous. I'm only giving it as high as a 2 because it's functional and completely playable.

The most annoying thing is the radius limitation. What I mean is that when playing co-op with a partner, the two players are not fully free to wander as each whishes to. The players are limited by a particular distance. This means that if you are going left while your partner is going right, the two will eventually stop going their directions, until your partner starts going your way, or you go your partner's way. This will result in zombies catching up with you (and hurt you badly and kill you) when shooting while backing up , not knowing how much further can you go.\n2. Grenades in this game seem to hurt you and your partner much more than they harm zombies, and while playing co-op, be assured that even when you keep your distance, you will get hurt by your partner's grenades.\n3. Some minor bugs: health packs seem to appear even after being picked up. Gates and checkpoints taking much time to clear the way and let you through.\n4. Too bad the game isn't designed for more than two players in co-op mode.\n","May 4, 2014","true","3.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Sure, this type of game is so incredibly common and overdone that it gets boring. For some reason, this really hit on point with me. If I have a few minutes to kill, it's going to be great for that. In comparison to other games in this exact subgenre, it's great!\n\nSound\n\nDon't know. I almost always mute the sounds on this type of game, because I know what it's going to be. Zombies groaning, guns shooting, maybe some heavy metal or spooky music. The end. I'm not going to use that as part of my judgment.\n\nGameplay\n\nFast paced and fun, you can upgrade your weapons in a number of ways, and you're not given a ridiculous onslaught with too many options. You're not presented with totally unrealistic weapon choices (at least not where I'm at in the game, at least.) It works!\n\nOverall\n\nI think it's worth it, and I know I had to get this on sale or in a bundle. For sure, in that context, it's great. I'm not looking at the full price, but I would say anything in the 10 dollar range is worthwhile.\n\n7.0/10 - Pretty good.","April 19, 2015","true","0.8"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

It wants to be L4D, but it just makes poor decisions at every turn. Explosions wound your teammate, and zombies pincer you at every time. This is exacerbated by the fact that they tether you bodily to your poor compatriot, who is prevented from going more than one screen away from you at every time. Unless you and your partner are communicating telepathically, this will be the cause of 90% of your deaths.\n\n\nThe other 10% will be made up of getting goomba stomped by one particular zombie who just comes out of left field every time. Visibility is hampered by bridge girders and other scenery getting in your way at every point, and every time it does you can assume that you're going to get accosted by zombies.\n\nWorse though are the barrels. There are four or five different colors, but most are just decoys for the red ones, which get bumped by  zombies and roll in front of your ally who was shooting the zombie behind you, explode in his face, and instantly kill him. Throughout the entire campaign, the barrels were responsible for more deaths than the zombies.\n\nThere's potential here. Where it is, I couldn't begin to tell you.

But in saying that, I must also add the fact that this games pros, sadly, do not outway the cons. I've listed the major points of both below, hope you find this review usefull, Thanks!\n\nPros\n-The developers put noticable effort into the enviroment and detail of the game\n-It has a standard networking system that's relatively easy to use, which I really appreciate in a multiplayer game\n-I love upgrading my gear in all games that allow it, and this one has a pretty good variety of weapons, each with the capabillity of being upgraded\n\nCons\n-The zombies take more lead than neccassary to put down\n-The undead also run just as fast and some are seemingly faster than you\n-Co-op experience is frustrating, because you tethered to your team member\n-The number one reason I don't like this game is....NO SAVING AT ALL (Besides Checkpoints), so if you're planning on beating the game, bring plenty of Mountain Dew and Get Comfy.","June 15, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got it as part of a Bundle ages ago, tried to play it, got about 30 minutes into it, then quit. I tried again just now and remembered, again, why it didn't grab me.\n\nI enjoy a twin stick shooter. I played quite a bit of Crimsonland, and Narco Terror is pretty fun (though crazy hard). In the case of Crimsonland you get a constant stream of upgrades, perks, and unlocks to keep you wanting to play. In the case of Narco Terror, it just has so much retro action movie personality and explosions! But this? It doesn't really have much going for it.\n\n- Oversaturated genre (zombies).\n- Muddy, dark art style.\n- Ridiculously fast zombies.\n- Slow, uninteresting upgrade/progression system.\n- No character customization.\n- Weak guns.","September 15, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
