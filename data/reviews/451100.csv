For a puzzle game I havent been blocked yet but I feel I have fought like a demon to get my cube to the right place at the right time!\n\nI havent rage quit yet...really encouraging !","May 31","true","1.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I had the chance to play the game during a french festival and it was very fun.\nAfter playing a couple of hours, I can say I had the same fun. It's very rewarding to play and pass over the tests.\nFrustrating, but not enough to be boring, colourful and a very zen music, I had a doubt on that detail but I have to admit the music is a good point, and help to focus.\n\nBe sure to be a great fan of puzzle games, this one is really good, but like all puzzle games, you have to be prepared, it will be a great challenge...and I love that!","May 20","true","0.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
