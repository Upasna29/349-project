"http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/recommended/209730/","csabber3","Green Lantern","http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/","174 products in account","Inspired by games like the Diablo franchise or Torchlight, Realms of Ancient War is an old school hack and slash dungeon crawler with very limited depth and breadth that is hard to overlook even tough it isn't a triple-A title. The story in the game is not the worst we've seen so far, in all honesty it's fairly interesting and one of the stronger points of the game. The game starts years after the so called Ancient War which divided the land to 4 territories (East, West, South and North...duh, imagination at it's best). The Northern King proposed truce so he invited the remaining kings to the Hero's Garden. Something went wrong because the Northern King was never to be seen again and the rest of the kings became soulless zombies. Yes, clichés after clichés, but it's not all that bad. The game contains some witty dialogues and turns.\n\nWe can pick from 3 unnamed characters: wizard, warrior and rogue. Each have different styles but they aren't that different that any would change the gameplay significantly. Each class has it's own skill tree, where you can level up your attacks. There are 1 level and 3 level skills. Skills open up gradually. The first group right after the beginning of the game, the second after you reach lvl 10, the last after lvl 20. However, there are two problems related to your skill management. First, in every stage you can gain exactly one level. No matter how much you fight or how many side quest (there aren't that many) you complete. You can only get  1 skill point in each stage. That makes the whole level grinding procedure useless and dropping all the challenge. You will get your skill point no matter what.\n\nThe second problem comes with the use of your skills. You have only 4 skills at your use at a given time. Two of them are to be activated with  the mouse and two with keystrokes on the keyboard. You can program these skills to the aforementioned buttons. If you want to use other skills you have to use the alternative set. Essentially you have 2 sets of skills, which can be changed at any time with a button push. Easy enough, in theory at least. Practice is a different beast. Remembering which skill you have assigned to which button in which set is pointless, painful and horrible. When a dozens of foes are attacking you there is no way this system can be use properly. Using this method is understandable on consoles where there are limited buttons to use, but on a PC it's unacceptable. This is where you realize that 4 skills/attacks are well enough to complete the game.\n\nAt least the fighting and hack'n slashing is exciting. You are continuously attacked by tens of enemies, making the game challenging and intense. Sometimes it is hard to hit smaller enemies, like spiders which live everywhere, rain forests or volcanoes it doesn't matter for them. Graphically the game doesn't excel, but it's not bad either. For an XBLA title it's passable. Not are the audio tracks though. Audio effects are horrible and repeating. Listening to the same 3 grindings throughout 8-10 hours when you hit enemies is annoying. The music is on par with the rest of the audio. You get one passable song which plays when you start the game, the rest of the music tracks during gameplay are just pointless burrs.\n\nR.A.W. is a below average hack and slash game that tries to build upon it's great predecessors of the genre but fails in every possible way. It's chaotic, mediocre and boring. A game that is hard to recommend when you can get a dozen of it's kind cheaper (or even for free). If you can finish it once there is no point starting the game ever again.\n\nRating: 45/100; Replay Value: 1/5; To Beat: 8-9 hours; Played on: normal.","November 3, 2013","false","8.4"," 93 of 110 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","93","110","0","0"

Then there are bigger issues, like ranged enemies attacking you outside the camera view or masses of enemies suddenly spawning en masse right next to you.  But it was at the point I spawned into a new room just to receive an attack from a ranged enemy that I gave up on this game.\n\nRealms of Ancient War feels like a first attempt at a Diablo style action-RPG which is fine as I'll play anything half decent.  Unfortunately, this game does not qualify.  It seemed the only way this game could provide a challenge is by swarming you with enemies that weren't on the same spot a second ago.  Or you may be trapped in a tiny area with no room to move around while fighting a boss.  Obviously things like this give the player a bad impression as opposed to any sense of challenge.  It seems I'm spending all my time attacking dwarves and spiders with the occasional lizard.\n\nEnvironment serves mostly to get in the way if you're a bow or magic wielder.  Even small rocks just above the ground can block your ranged weapons.  To make matters worse, they console-ify the game by limiting you to four available skills at one time along with a health and mana potion.  That reminds me a little too much of the limiting skillset of Diablo 3.  You can switch to a second skill set by pressing Tab while using the same keys, but that is terribly unintuitive compared to just giving us the action keys we need.  Keys are not rebindable either.\n\nI made it to level 10 but could not continue any further.  I suspect most will drop the game before this point.","August 3, 2015","false","4.5"," 62 of 67 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","62","67","0","1"

On the surface, R.A.W. is another Diablo-style hack & slash RPG lootfest wherein you slay endless waves of strikingly homogenous minions and swap gear out for marginally better gear. In this respect, R.A.W. succeeds where many others succeed and fails where many others fail; gameplay is satisfying (if repetitive at times), programming is relatively bug-free, and the story is... well.. there's a story at least, some games don't even have that. What R.A.W. provides for Steam, however, is all of this formula that can be enjoyed both with a controller and with a local friend. If you own at least one 360 controller, you and a friend can enjoy quite a few hours of good old mindless RPG baddie slaughter. Overall, I'd give this game a 6.5/10; solid gameplay, proper controller support, and local multiplayer often outshine the game's general lack of ambition.","August 28, 2014","true","7.6"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","29","34","2","0"

The game is simple, you aren't doing much more than slashing through waves over waves of enemies and take their mostly not so spectacular loot.\nI wouldn't say it's too repetetive judged by the level design, which has quite the variety from each area. There's sand levels, ice levels, fairy forests, dark jungles, castles and a weird meta ghost world. And that's not even all. Enemy types could be more diverse, but at least there IS change to it - plus smaller and bigger bosses.\nYou have three classes, I'm playing as warrior - and the levelable skills are satisfactory in my eyes. You can choose to be more defensive or more of a battle type.\n\nI don't about the story, but from what I understand it's okay to have a reason for all the monsters and quests.\n\nThe game is very linear, don't expect any open world / sandbox feeling.\n\nIf you search for a pure action RPG with lots of monster killing and dig a nice graphic style, then you might wanna try this out. You liked Greed: Black Border? Then definitely try this out. You want a lot of open world feel, a great variety of quests, a lot of voiced over dialogue? Then you might wanna skip this.\n\nOh: You should play this with an Xbox 360 controller, if you have one. It plays GREAT with it ;)","December 9, 2013","true","6.3"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","31","40","0","0"

The four kings met in the North to fight back an ancient evil which is trying to come back. Only three made it out beaten and worn and the North King was frozen in crystal. This is where you come in and find the North King and he speaks to you telepathically asking for your help. He melds with your body and sets you on a task to open the four portals of north, south, east, and west lands.\n\nPlaying the game isn’t bad it’s just not great. There isn’t much variety in enemies as you’ll fight mostly the same ones over and over which will become monotonous over time. Your weapons and armor don’t really make much of a difference in what you use. Basically you find a better one and it gives you a higher damage or defense. You can also have elemental damage of fire or poison to your weapons but those didn’t seem to add anything noticeable. Skills get added each level but none of them were that great or make me excited to level them up or unlock them.\n\nThe story is pretty weak and didn’t really hold me or make me want to pay attention much. You’ll fight through the same levels or what seems like the same levels many times. Make it halfway through the game and then go back and do it all over again. Not too exciting if you ask me.\n\nOverall R.A.W. is a mediocre game which wasn’t bad to play but not worth playing more than once. Co-op may add a little fun to it but since I played it already by myself I don’t see the real reason to play it again unless you want all the achievements.\n\nBear Rating: 6/10","March 29, 2014","false","9.1"," 27 of 40 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","27","40","0","0"

In all honesty, R.A.W. is more of a Gauntlet clone, but with some more RPG elements thrown in.\n\nThe game is mostly a slogfest. Kill enemies, maybe do a random quest, reach the next area. Most likely get one experience level on the way (there is an experience cap per area and once that has been reached you barely get any experience).\n\nIs this a problem? Not really. Sure, the game might feel sluggish at times, but overall it actually keeps on going pretty well. And except for the beginning when I didn't use the compass enough I never really got stuck anywhere. (Oh, and there's no map in the game, only a compass which shows the general direction you're supposed to go.)\n\nOverall: Not a bad game. Not the best game in the genre, definitely not the worst. Just don't go in hoping to get a Diablo game, then you'll be disappointed.","February 13, 2015","true","5.8"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

Do you crave bland action, boring levels, and uninteresting loot? Is the idea of pointlessly slaughtering millions of dull creatures for pitiful rewards getting you all hot and bothered? Then I dare you to take the ultimate challenge: Attempt to complete this game without pushing your PC out a window.\n\nI really tried to stomach R.A.W. I did everything I could to make the experience more pleasant for me. I played my favorite music, had something good to drink, and dreamed about beautiful and amazing things. Unfortunately, this game is just so by-the-numbers and repetitive. The way I see it, quitting the game would free up the use of my hands. These hands could be used for more entertaining activities...... Like drumming on the desk.\n\nR.A.W. is split up into multiple stages. In each stage you kill a few hundred enemies, and a boss or three. Sometimes these minions and/or bosses use ranged-attacks. Aside from the demon army from hell that constantly spawns, you'll also kill skeletons, spiders, humans, dwarves, AND elves. It's pretty silly if you think about it, since there's a complete lack of explanation as to why the races of the world hate your guts. The only people who aren't trying to kill you have quests or objects to sell. I recall at one point a man told me to kill a dwarf, but then the dwarf told me to kill the man, but when I went back to the man, he told me to kill the dwarf, so I gave up and moved on. The quests usually award an item that's worse than whatever you have equipped anyway.\n\nSadly, the quests are perhaps the only time the game actually tries. Everything else that occurs in each stage is merely tedious. You'll spend large chunks of the game with only 1 or 2 skills to use, which makes combat even less exciting. The level-up system is an absolute joke. When you enter a new stage, the first level-up will come very quickly. After that, the experience point awards drop off a cliff. The cycle begins anew as soon as you reach the next stage. Why even bother having an experience system? Just have the player choose what skills they want, as soon as they arrive at a new location. Instead there has to be this mind-numbing half-baked system. The enemies drop mostly junk, so outside of the slim possibility a boss will drop something decent, there's no incentive to fight. Once you get your guaranteed level-up, you could probably just run past everything. It doesn't seem to matter one way or another.\n\nWhile the opportunity to slay countless elves & dwarves does sound appealing to me, I had to get rid of R.A.W. It's a thoroughly mindless hack & slash that is bested by hundreds of other titles. If you happen to discover this game in your library. My advice is not to panic. It probably crept into one of your indie bundle purchases. Just ignore it and move on.","October 22, 2015","false","3.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","81","13","16","13","0"

The graphics and effects within this game were overall nice to look at and the art design was actually quite beutiful, however it will really be nothing new for this type of game. In terms of gameplay you are constantly fighting wave after wave of enemies which overall was quite enjoyable however it did get repetative quite quickly as there is not that many different types of enemies on offer within the game, the 'boss' fights if you want to call them that took close around 5 - 10 seconds, with the final two bosses in the game taking around 45 seconds, for me this was a bit pathetic as it did not present much of a challenge at all and required little to no strategy.\n\nOverall I found the experience that is on offer to be okay and taking around 10 hours to complete all 26 levels and side quests the game is on the short side so maybe wait for it to go on sale if you are considering purchasing it. I would recommend this game on the basis that I did enjoy certain areas of it and prior to playing this I had never really played many Hack'n Slash games.\n\nRating: 5/10","January 24, 2014","true","10.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Unfortunately, this game has left me massively disappointed.\n\nStory\nYou are wandering around when you get attacked by some creatures. A voice tells you to head through a portal. You find the voice belongs to one of the 4 realms Kings, who is trapped in crystal and yet still able to communicate. He wants your help to activate 4 gates and stop these creatures at the source.\n\nMore stuff happens later, but it doesn't get any better. The story is boring and forgettable. I quickly lost interest in it myself.\n\nPresentation\nGraphically, this game is decent. Not great, with the fixed camera, boring locations and constant repeated enemy types, but it isn't horrible. You at least know where you are on the screen, most of the time.\n\nMusic and sound effects are poor at best. Fortunately, you won't remember it after you are done with the game.\n\nControls\nThe keyboard / mouse controls are just awful. Please, don't even try to play this without a gamepad. Playing with a gamepad has its problems still, but it can be played at least. You are unable to remap anything but the four face buttons, which could result in some irritation since the game doesn't follow the standard controls for similar games that use a gamepad.\n\nGameplay\nMove forward, beat up enemies that spawn out of nowhere within sight of your character, and repeat. The randomly spawning enemies are quite a pain in the ♥♥♥♥, and it doesn't help they don't even spawn out of camera.\n\nGear is boring, with each piece of equipment for your chosen camera being the same as your previous gears in every way but stats. Speaking of stats, only gear can change those, levelling simply allows you a skill point to power up mostly pointless skills. Each skill doesn't even give you specifics on their enhancements, instead saying stuff like 'Minor damage, Moderate damage and Greater damage', meaning you won't even know how useful a skill is without spending points on it. At least there is an item you can use to have all skill points reset so you can later invest them in better skills.\n\nWandering around each level can be bothersome as you have not been given a minimap of any sort, just a compass to point you towards your current quest location. Most levels aren't so big that you require it, but its sill an annoying omission.\n\nLifespan\nIf you can somehow beat the game even once, you still have the option of beating the game with all three character classes. I pity the people attempting such a goal.\n\nThis also has a rather poor co-op mode, with the second player having a character with a scaled level and default equipment, that won't be saved between levels. Beyond getting an achievement by having a second player join in, I doubt anyone will bother with co-op.\n\nClosing\nEven ignoring the much better competition that was released years ago, this game is a poor choice for purchase. I would recommend against purchasing this title, your money can and should be spent on much better items.","September 29, 2013","false","5.8"," 36 of 69 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","36","69","0","3"

It is the definition of a backlog game. You know, one of those games in your steam list that you never get around to playing. The only reason I even played it is because it's a mindless, linear slashfest to hack away at while skyping with friends.\n\nIt is essentially a stripped down Diablo clone. You play as one of the three generic classes, and then walk through some of the most linear level design you will ever experience (except for the first level, which is for some weird reason a maze). You just grab some gear, level up some skill points, and go forward. That's it; nothing else to it. Perhaps it would have been even the tiniest bit better if you could do co-op, but it's LAN only. Yeah, a game from 2012 on the PC is LAN only.\n\nIf you managed to get this game for a dollar or something, maybe it's worth trying it out for an hour to see what you think of it. But your time would be better spent on any of the other Diablo-ish games out there, like Path of Exile, Van Helsing, or, you know, Diablo.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/209730/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","First off, I'd like to say that I had a mildly enjoyable time playing this game in the first couple of hours. It's not all bad, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a good game.\nRAW is a game that doesn't do anything very well. It's mostly generic, with no inovation whatsoever, and then with a subpar combat due to being designed for consoles.\n\nCombat and Controls.\nThe most important thing in a game like this should be the combat. I've finished the game with the Mage class, and it feels very "spammy", since you click to launch a fireball, and that's your main attack. The Skill Trees are simple enough, having 3 tiers from which you can level up abilities and get some new ones. The bad thing here is that half of them are useless, and the upgrades are very straightforward, none of them being out of ordinary.\nAnother big problem with it is that you only have 2 mouse button, plus 1-4 for abilities, 3 and 4 being necessarily your potion slots. You can hit TAB to switch to an alternative 1-4 set of abilities, but it's just a pain in the ♥♥♥ to do so in the middle of combat. Seriously, why the ♥♥♥♥ would you port a game to a PC and not change that? How hard can it be?! It just demonstrates laziness from the developers, imo.\n\nThe Difficulty is also too easy. Far too easy. I've played this game in Heroic Mode and I've barely died. And when I died, it was because I was very much distracted (Yes, since the combat is mostly pressing LMB, you lose focus pretty easily). Also, the "difficulty" only comes from swarming you with enemies that appear out of nowhere, and their attacks can stun you for a second.  On the other hand, they also died very easily, providing no challenge. The big mobs, Bosses, if you will... are the easiest. They're big and slow, make it very easy to dodge their attacks and just knock them back as soon as they get close to you.\n\nEnemy variety is close to non-existent. There are like 2 melee units, one faster than the other, then there is a ranged unit, and then there are spiders. Lots of those. Every enemy is essentially a reskin of the mentioned. Mini Bosses are pretty much larger versions of those enemies, far slower and with more HP. None of them has any noteworthy ability, it's just dodging projectiles, and killing enemies from afar.\n\nGraphics.\nThis game looks okay. Nothing that blew me away, but it looks pretty good nonetheless, even if rough around the edges. For the first half of the game, you're traveling through different places which gives a good variety to the levels. On the second part of the game, you're going through the same kind of places, which gets a bit tedious, close to the end.\nAn important issue I had with the graphics, is that the enemies are always the same color as the background. Why the ♥♥♥♥...?! How could they not see that? In every level, you can't even see most enemies very well due to all the colors being very similar. This is just bad design and I have no explanation for why they'd do it.\nIn regards to effects, they're generally good enough, with the exception of the Fireball, which looks pretty bland.\nAnimation quality is service-able, it's not bad, but it's not stellar either.\n\nSound.\nSound effects were also pretty bland, nothing noteworthy here. The music fits the setting, but, again, nothing to write home about. This feels more of an arcade game rather than an ARPG.\n\nLevel Design.\nDespite their visual variety in the first half of the game, there's nothing unforgettable here. Levels are quite short, and have nothing interesting. Nothing to tell the world's story, other than "everything is mad at you and will attack you". Except for vendors, who are not attack.. for some reason.\nLater in the game, there are a couple of different levels, more of an arena and labyrinths, but they're like 2 or 3 levels. Out of the 26 available.\nThere was room for much more here... Side quests are very uninteresting as well, and require almost no sidetracking. Mostly "Get this random package to this point ahead in the level", or "Kill this bad guy".\nALSO, no map! Seriously? Why? This makes no sense. It's not that one would get lost all that much, but it would be helpful to keep track of where the player is, and what's left to explore. AND, at one point, part of the main quest is to slay monsters in West, SouthWest and NorthWest. Fair enough. The problem is, there are no ♥♥♥♥ing directions. No map, no compass, no direction indicator. And South isn't just down. West was Down and to the Right. There's no ♥♥♥♥ing reason for that to be west. And that kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. That just makes no sense, and was a piece of very bad design in my opinion.\n\nAchievements.\nUh. Why would one review achievements? Well, I believe that achievements can help the player try out new things, explore a bit more and discover interesting things in the mechanics or the world. Well, not here. Achievement are very generic as well, so... yeah. They might as well not be here.\n\nConclusion.\nUnfortunately, this game doesn't really do anything very well. It does some things pretty badly. But it's not something I'm mad that it exists. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless you really like this type of games.\nI took some enjoyment out of it, it's not all bad, but there's sooooo much that need to be reworked here... Well, maybe the next game will be better. And please, do not make it all console-like again if you're porting it to the PC. That might have been the cause of most of its problems.\nCheers.\n","January 26, 2014","false","9.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

No minimap, no way to activate health bars on enemies & it can be hard to click exactly on a particular enemy at times. Sometimes the character gets stuck attacking the air for a few seconds after you kill an enemy. I thought, ok, I can tolerate this since howlongtobeat.com says this game only takes about 10 hours to beat. The skills feel satisfying to use and I was having fun murdering bunches of enemies at a time.\n\nThen I discovered this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ death mechanic. You get soulstones, which are like "continues." They get used up when you die. There doesn't seem to be any way to get more of them. I was playing on hard, so I lost all my continues at the end of the first level because the quest caught me off guard. The screen just fills up with enemies that constantly respawn. You're supposed to fend them off for a while and then go into some portal, but they all block you pretty hard. The warrior has a leap slam skill, but you can get interrupted when casting it. When you lose all your continues, you start the game over from the beginning. Its kinda wierd because I still have all my skills, gear, and experience. Why do I have to restart from the beginning?! I think it might just make you restart from the beginning of the level you are currently on.\n\nI perma-died twice more and finally got through the level. I'm at level 3 now. My sister walked into my room and asked my why I was frowning so hard. I didn't even realize I was. My body is rejecting this stupid game pretty hard. I'll tough it out and try to playthrough to the end.\n\nTheres only local-coop, which is stupid and useless.

RAW isn't as good as similar loot-heavy fare like Sacred 2 and Torchlight, but there's a certain charm to it.\n\nRAW follows the action-RPG template pretty closely: you pick one of three character classes (warrior, rogue, mage), and hack, slash, and cast your way through hordes of monsters. Defeating enemies and completing quests earns XP, which can be used to upgrade your character's skills. The three skill trees are all fairly different, so there's some variety there.\n\nThere's a story in RAW, but you won't care about it. And for those hoping for an open world to explore, RAW is instead very linear, although you can explore the maps a little, looking for hidden items.\n\nRAW has one novelty: every now and then you can take over a giant enemy like a tree man or a huge werewolf and use them to smash smaller foes to smithereens. There aren't a lot of these parts, but they're enjoyable when they arrive. And unlike many other games, enemy corpses don't disappear in RAW. Some of the later levels will be absolutely covered in wall-to-wall dead bodies.\n\nRAW was meant to be played with a controller, so if you have one you're in luck. The interface was very well thought-out, and the game works great with an Xbox 360 gamepad.\n\nLike other hack 'n' slash RPGs, RAW can be played co-operatively. Co-op is limited to two-player local play though; there's no online play available.\n\nRAW: Realms of Ancient War isn't a classic, but it's more fun than it should be.","November 26, 2013","true","18.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Although, the premise of the game has been done to death.\n\nThe Bad:\n-Dumb-dumb AI: This game, on normal at least, is stupid easy. They run at you in a straight line, no matter where they are. If you're behind a wall, they will run into the wall at you. So, killing them is boring. If you're a rogue, set down a trap, slow them, shoot in a straight line until they're all dead. Really basic, nothing special, all of the enemies are like this. Even the bosses.\n-Kinda Dumb Premise: So, I don't really see a reason to finish this game. Nothing special, I don't expect a rewarding ending and the premise is standard. Four nations, must go to all four, unlock stuff, fight bosses, get loot, no explanation as to why you're the chosen one, etc. Same BS, different game. Not worth finishing.\n\nOverall:\nIf you really sit down and just burn through this game you can finish it in a day or a weekend. It's not hard, and its not really that fun. I mean, its alright game to burn some time. It's not horrible and if you're just looking for a time waster, play it. It's enjoyable in that regard. But, if you're looking for a Diablo clone, go download Path of Exile (F2P) and just play that.","November 26, 2013","false","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is not clunky or poorly done, it is very smooth and has good production value and very nice graphics. It got low scores because it is a bit basic compared to games like Diablo 3 and Van Helsing, but it is still a fun action game nonetheless. IGN, who are my fav review site on the net and I normally agree with them, gave this a 5.5 which I highly disagree with. I feel sorry for whomever was playing it because he said that you die a lot in this game. He must suck bad at video games because that isn't true at all. I've died maybe twice so far and I have been playing a while with my mage (lvl 19 so far). And when I died it was avoidable. I was just being lazy. 5.5 is a very unfair score for this game.\n\nDespite its basic console game feel, this game is well done graphically and gameplay-wise and can be a lot of fun. The classes (mage, warrior, thief) are all fun to play and have cool fun skills. My favorite things about the game are its graphics and the ultra smooth gameplay. It has really well done smooth graphics and good sound. Not having a block or dodge sucks, but otherwise It feels really smooth and easy to play because it has a great game engine. And besides, you will have enough healing potions plus you can put points into a rechargable self-heal skill that is a must-have. This game sorta reminds me of Van Helsing in how it feels, but even smoother, and for this game I use my wired xbox 360 controller which is highly recommended because it is designed for a controller.\n\nIt's a fun game and well worth what I paid for it because of how incredibly smooth it plays and how good the graphics imo are, 7/10","October 11, 2013","true","8.5"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

I should have listened. I can usually find the good in a game, even one most people think is nothing but crap, outside one or two things, there are too many bad poaints here to warrent anything but a negative review.\n\nWhile the gameplay itself is your basic hack-n-slash, the controls are a mess, even with a controller; potions bound to the triggers, item pick-ups with the R. Shoulder and the d-pad used **only** for menu navigation?? Horridly stupid. Even the KB/M setup is difficult to use effectivly. You;re supposed to have 2 "skills setups" but switching is often not even necessary. You;re also limted to gaining only **ONE** level per stage, so grinding so you can overpower the enemies/boss of the next stage? Never. Gonna. Happen. Takes almost all of the fun out of exploring the map. Why bother killing everything in a stage when after a point it nets me no rewards aside from gear that I probably won't use?\n\nThe story is OK, if a big cliche. There is almost no distinction between the 3 characters and the respawn system is just annoying (needing a special item JUST to respawn at a checkpoint?!). That's not to say it isn't playable, just that whomever came up with some of the mechanics here needs to rethink their choices. The fixed top-down camera used here is also a problem, as environmental elements will often get in the way of seeing things like chests and sometimes enemies. There's also no mini-map, so you're stuck looking for you quest goals (marked by a sometimes nearly invisible symbol about it) with nothing but an arrow you can make appear around your character.\n\nIf you're looking for a decent top-down hack-n-slash game, go buy Van Helsing and support a game that gives you a good challenege, great writing/voice acting and far better visuals and gameplay that what you'll find here. Plus the devs of Van Helsing actually read the forums and listen to our suggestings and bug reports.","December 13, 2013","false","0.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Recently I was going through my games to see what I haven't played yet and I couldn't remember why I decided against downloading this game. So I gave it a shot...and then remembered why I hadn't wanted to play.\n\nThe gameplay video on the page shows the player fighting off hordes of enemies. Just mob after mob, and that's pretty much all the gameplay it shows because that's all you're going to be doing. I know hack-and-slash games are really popular but I've been fairly indifferent towards them; I don't hate them but they're not my first choice for a game play experience. I've played Diabolo II and enjoyed it for a few weeks before the repetitiveness got to me.  I couldn't even spend an hour playing R.A.W. before I had to give up and just delete it from my computer.\n\nNot only is it pretty much just you fighting horde after horde of creatures, it's really buggy at the same time. You can click and click while making no progress and I found myself getting stuck in the middle of a large group and unable to move or fight so I ended up dying. And this is at the beginning of the game! There's nothing engaging or original about the story and the combat is more frustrating than anything. It's an exercise in futility and I am really glad that I didn't really buy the bundle for this game.","June 18, 2014","false","0.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But a game like Gauntlet is no fun with broken multiplayer, and abysmal difficulty. There’s no apparent way to set the game up for online or couch co-op. And the enemies are so painfully easy that the games notion of difficulty is spawning them en masse.\n\nThere is a rather entertaining gimmick of taking control of the stronger unique enemies, but it’s used so infrequently that it is hardly worth noting.\n\nFurther, broken achievements with no fix in sight due to developers abandoning the game.\nIf you’re looking for (reportedly) 12-15 hours of game time in a mediocre excuse at an ARPG than look no further.

Perhaps you'll like it, I didn't.\n\nNever bothered to finish it / 10","May 24, 2015","false","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It may not be the next Diablo, but so what? It's still very enjoyable! In my opoinion, the experience is much better with a controller (I use an Xbox 360), movement is smooth and combat responsive in a way the keyboard & mouse can't quite match. This is definitely an action-oriented game, not a more literary or strategy-minded RPG - and that's one of the things I like about it. Sometimes you just want to bash hell out of stuff! The graphics are better than many of the other reviews here indicate, but anyway these days the graphical presentation of any one game is such an incredibly subjective thing that as long as a game runs smooth visually, that's what is really important. And RAW does. The environments are detailed, the atmosphere is well-crafted, and the overall look of the world is consistent. Oh, and the lighting is very nicely done as well! I've really enjoyed my time with it thus far, and will continue to do so, I'm sure.  -XT","April 5, 2015","true","12.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I got this game only as part of a package that other games came in.  Otherwise, I wouldn't pay more than a couple bucks for it.\n\nI played on the top difficulty setting, and it really doesn't make the game "difficult".  The beginning is annoying because you get swarmed by immense amounts of enemies before you get crowd control abilities, but once you do, it's a piece of cake (even though they literally pop out of thin air which is a stupid spawn mechanic).\n\nThe possession ability is keyed to wheel-click which is stupid.  A lot of mice don't even have good wheel clicking.\n\nFocus skills don't seem to work.\n\nLeveling up is basically capped to one character level per game level.  You still gain experience, but it's not at the same pace as the first level you gain.\n\nStory is dry and typical.  Game length is short.\n\nOutrightly plagarizes from other series such as Lord of the Rings with Legolas and Ents, and Baldur's Gate.\n\nAll and all... meh out of 10.","October 13, 2015","false","21.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/209730/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Realms of Ancient War is an action/role-playing game with a strong affinity for hack ’n’ slash, developed by Wizarbox. At the beginning of the story, you must choose whether you are going to spend the game hurling fireballs and deadly spells at numerous foes as a Wizard, slowly ploughing your way through armies of enemies as a powerful Warrior, or utilise your endless skills of survival striking from the shadows as a Rogue. You are then presented with a quick run-through of recent events of the last few decades or so, and then are thrown head-first right into the action, slowly turning your character into an unstoppable whirlwind of fury, complete with a power pretty unique to Realms of Ancient War that allows you to take control of your enemy’s strongest units and turn them on their own.\n\nIn the first impressions, Realms of Ancient War has obviously had a lot of time and energy invested into it for its graphics, which really shine through at points. The loading screens are actually some of the most pleasing to the eye and the scenery in the game tends to be very well-put-together. The magic spells especially, although only visible for a short time, look great and the scenery, again, is overall of a very high standard. The title has also managed to ensure that the dead bodies of your former opponents stay on the battlefield instead of evaporating as they tend to do in most other titles, which allows for an enhanced sense of satisfaction as you look around caves that are now marked with your handiwork. In contrast, the actual character design, which looks stunning in all of the artwork, is disappointing. You will certainly notice the main things about your character as they change throughout the game and you equip them with different coloured armor and weaponry, but on the most part all of the little details have seemingly been quickly brushed over, leading to an overall effect which just isn’t quite satisfactory, especially at higher levels where you look almost identical to how you did at the start.\n\nThe combat in Realms of War almost certainly delivers on its promise of being a hack ’n’ slash as you work your way through innumerable enemies of different varieties, depending on where you are along the storyline. You will find yourself being ambushed by large amounts of enemies that don’t tend to have that much life at all. You can breeze through most of the game as long as you are careful as to where you run to so you don’t get blocked in, because once you are blocked in you will almost certainly be cut down by the horde which has beelined straight for you – a design you will very quickly be able to use to your advantage. Throw down a poison trap and walk backwards a few steps and it is guaranteed that whatever is running at you will completely disregard the danger and run straight into it. Running away is your number one and only form of defence, seeing as there is not a control for blocking or dodging at all.\n\nWizard and Rogue classes allow you to use ranged attacks before you go charging in, and although they tend to look great and give you the upper hand in small skirmishes, more often than not you will find that any distance between you and your target has been closed down before you can manage more than a few shots. Luckily, as you grind through enemies you also grind up the levels and you will be given skill points to assign to different characteristics, such as increased ranged damage or an increased mana pool, which make these ranged moments a little more useful; but in the most part, the skill points you assign tend to actually do very little.\n\nCombat-wise, you will also come to grips with the soul gems. During each level, you are only assigned a certain amount, which are used to revive. Running out of soul gems means you are sent back to the start of the level, and it is not until late in the game where you will be given the opportunity to avoid using one. However, it definitely adds a twist to the game, which notches up the difficulty a little and makes the game a little tenser as your supply begins to dwindle.\n\nIn addition, Realms of Ancient War has a less-than-gripping storyline, and you will rarely feel the compulsion to carry on playing like you do with other games of the same genre. The lore is vague, and the opening sequence of events that explains the recent history gives you very little idea into this world of warcraft and wizardry and the relationships between the four different sections of the continent, and you don’t really cover much more of this as you work your way through the game. Furthermore, the levels can be a little confusing to navigate at points, due to a strange choice of deciding not to include a map or mini-map; as well, directional arrows tend to point as the crow flies, but if you have some experience with these types of games then there should not be too much problem with finding your way around. The way the dead bodies remain on the floor will almost certainly signal to you that you have been there before.\n\nFinally, although the game lacks multiplayer, you can engage in a co-op campaign by connecting a few wireless controllers. This makes the game a lot more playable and does reduce the chances of your character getting mobbed by the throngs of creatures out for your heads. However, it is a little bit disheartening to find you cannot team up with somebody over the Internet, which would have made the game a lot more appealing in an era where almost every game has some form of online capability.\n\nIn conclusion, Realms of War is a title that is on the lower side of average in the genre it exists in. Although the graphics are great from the menu screens and scenery, the characters just never seem to look that detailed or magnificent as you would want them to, and it contrasts greatly with the artwork displayed throughout. The combat system is very basic as it lacks a mini-map, blocking, and dodging; and you tend to spend your time in the middle of a sea of monsters. But to give credit where credit is due, it is still very enjoyable to hack your way through such a large opposition and come out the other end, and the brief moments of rampage as you take charge of some of the stronger units are definitely great fun. In terms of length, the game will take up a large chunk of time if you decide to play through all three campaigns, but it does lead to the question whether you will truly enjoy the game for that long.\n\nSlightly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 9, 2014","true","48.2"," 13 of 31 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","13","31","2","2"

(Note, I played as the Mage) It's a Gauntlet Legends style game with the appearance of a Diablo Clone. It's an Xbox title and oddly enough, works better with a controller. With that, you have less keys for skills, so you're often running and kiting enemies to stay alive and spamming your main attack for kills. The first major AoE attack for the mage has a long cooldown, and isn't reliable for dealing with the large hordes thrown at you at a regular basis. This game would have benefitted from having a twin stick shooter controller setup that would allow you to simultaneously move and shoot. Instead, you're endlessly kiting groups, stopping to shoot for a a second, and then repeating that process. You also have enemies that shoot deadly, multi-way projectiles, which wouldn't be a problem if you had a dodge button or a better control scheme to deal with it - you're constantly running, leaving you less time to deal damage, since you don't have alot of strong spells where you can sit in a group of enemies like other Diablo clones. The game might get better further into it, you get the ability to possess big, tanky creatures - but even the first one I possessed became surrounded and I was stuck in a flood of enemies. R.A.W. Might be more bearable with a 2nd player, but there are many better games of this type out there. It's a shame, I like the art style and music here.","August 11, 2013","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics are decent, sound is pretty good (along the lines of Bard's Tale), but game play is barely more than clicking.  Once in a while when the forces grow large you need to plan out your assault; otherwise hack and slash to your hearts content.  Making money is easy enough and the rewards (coins, armor, weapons) are OK.\n\nEdited 11-11-2014\n\nSo...I'm several more hours invested and now feel I should update my opinion of the graphics.  Really a nice job overall with seemless loading transistions. detailed characters and environments, and good variety of all of it.  I have experienced zero glitchiness of any kind.  If there is a down side it has to be in the shortish/small levels as a general rule.  The story also improves over the course of the game with an interesting twist at the mid-point.\n\nThis interface has lot more potential than is being taken advantage of for this game.  I like their short skill trees as it stands for the level of current character/level development.  It provides for some decision  making without being a hassle for the casual gamer and does impact the performance of the chosen toon.  The variety of objects within the game is excessive and uneccessary however.  Too many items that will never be used for anything but selling for coin.\n\nThis game does a nice job of being playable in both short and epic sessions.","October 28, 2014","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/svorenson/recommended/209730/","svorenson","svorenson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/svorenson/","1142 products in account","This is a rather basic action RPG, which I enjoyed playing with a gamepad (I have no idea how it plays with a keyboard and mouse.) The actions map very well to the controller, and auto targetting of ranged attacks avoids frustration. As a matter of fact, general combat and maneuvering are what kept me playing. If you need to have deep customizable builds on your action RPGs (e.g. Torchlight II), you may want to pass on this one. The skill trees do not allow for really varied builds and the random items are uninspired (yay, an item called 'purple hat' or 'orange chain mail' with minor bonuses to stats...)\n\nIt seems that this game was designed to be played co-op, and in my opinion the Wizard is the most viable if playing solo. Still, you have to be very careful of the frequent ambushes of mobs that spawn out of nowhere, often surrounding your character. By the middle of the game I had configured a "panic mode" alternate set of skills just to handle these situations.\n\nThe 'possession' mechanic adds some novelty, effectively allowing the character to change into a monster for a while. I wish it was explored as a general mechanic throughout the game, rather than used mostly in specific spots.\n\nVisually, I found the game to be satisfactory, with varied environments, and decent visual effects and animations. The background music did not draw my attention, for better or worse.\n\nTo sum it up: I would recommend this for someone looking for a quick fix of action-RPG (mostly action) that can be played with a gamepad, preferably if it can be picked up on a sale.","December 21, 2013","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plain skill tree system is...a gross understatement. Half hour -maybe less- into the game, and you know pretty much everyhing you need about the game. I used wizard the first playthrough, and dare I say spamming fireballs -the first skill set- is probably your main and only needed skill to last you to the end game. Completed wizard in 12hrs. I'm guessing it'll take 4~7hrs for speed run. May still play other chars for achievements sake, and for atoning my mistake from starting this game in the first place.\nVerdict: not worth your time & money.","December 22, 2013","false","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I play with a friend in local co-op mode with 360 controllers. I do like the fact that the game supports controllers and has the OSD for the buttons. There is just enough items, upgrades, and skill points to keep my intrest for a while. After a two hour session the game seems quite repetitive. Another aspect of the game that makes this relitively easy is the fact friendly fire will not hurt you.\n\nI bought this game on Humble Bundle in a pack with others for cheap. I would not recommend paying full price for this.","December 22, 2013","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Note, I played as the Mage) It's a Gauntlet Legends style game with the appearance of a Diablo Clone. It's an Xbox title and oddly enough, works better with a controller. With that, you have less keys for skills, so you're often running and kiting enemies to stay alive and spamming your main attack for kills. The first major AoE attack for the mage has a long cooldown, and isn't reliable for dealing with the large hordes thrown at you at a regular basis. This game would have benefitted from having a twin stick shooter controller setup that would allow you to simultaneously move and shoot. Instead, you're endlessly kiting groups, stopping to shoot for a a second, and then repeating that process. You also have enemies that shoot deadly, multi-way projectiles, which wouldn't be a problem if you had a dodge button or a better control scheme to deal with it - you're constantly running, leaving you less time to deal damage, since you don't have alot of strong spells where you can sit in a group of enemies like other Diablo clones. The game might get better further into it, you get the ability to possess big, tanky creatures - but even the first one I possessed became surrounded and I was stuck in a flood of enemies. R.A.W. Might be more bearable with a 2nd player, but there are many better games of this type out there. It's a shame, I like the art style and music here.","August 11, 2013","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a bit subjective, but I hate how you move your character and attack with the same god damn button. When you're fighting you're constantly spam clicking on the enemies, but lots of enemies are tiny, like spiders for example. Which means you'll be akwardly switching between moving towards the enemies and attacking them because you move and attack with the same button and the spiders are too tiny.\n\nIt also feels incredibly boring, part of this is how easy it feels. I played on normal mode and got 10 extra health potions within 5 minutes. In a well thought out game this would either not happen, or the game would be designed around an excess of potions. There's no real delay between using potions, so you can just spam them whenever you're low on health.\n\nOverall not a well made or fun/enjoyable game.","December 22, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What they did right in the game was the amount of enemies on screen at once. Hitting 30 enemies at once with an AOE spell is pretty satisfying.\n\nThere is a game-breaking bug with the Rogue, however. After levelling her up to shoot 4 arrows in a row, the next skill called Rain of Arrows actually makes her shoot 1 arrow at a time, significantly reducing the effectiveness of arrows. It's basically a punishment for progressing...\n\nOnce I found this bug I went from a Yes recommendation to a No.\n\nThe AI is also extremely dumb. The enemies often get stuck on corners and you can easily exploit this.\n\nAnd another minor complaint is you can't break the barrels lying around. Destructable environments are basically a staple of the genre.\n\nPlay Torchlight instead.","November 21, 2015","false","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It could definitely be much more - it certainly has the potential. Story is very simple - in the current state is's simply an excuse for going around, killing hundreds of creatures. This is probably the biggest issue. Gameplay is OK - again, nothing to write home about, but serves its purpose. This is probably going to be interesting to the people that are either hardcore ARPG fans, or that are looking for a game they can play between some "more serious" titles.\n\nI get the impression that a lot of negative reviews are not fair - this game certainly cannot compete with Diablo 3, Path of Exile, Adventures of Van Helsing, or similar titles, but it is still an OK game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/clairne/recommended/209730/","clairne","fista1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/clairne/","43 products in account","RAW is a budget game with all pros and cons. I'd recommend it for fans of hack and slash RPGs who have finished all other games from this genre and are desperate to play some more. The others should probably look up for the better games first. Torchlight or The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing are examples of the better games.\n\nThere are bugs in this game. The first occurred when I tried to load a save file. The game froze. What's more, the game sometimes doesn't recognize pressed buttons, thanks to which your character won't use his/her special ability or drink health/mana potion. My character couldn't continue his journey to the next room because of a bug, so I had to restart the level. However, the biggest problem I had with the game is that it won't save your position in the level. So when you quit the game and want to come back to it later, you have to start from the beginning of the level. And yes, the enemies respawns. I also don't like that the game saves my progress only on checkpoints instead of anytime I wish(like in Van Helsing or Torchlight).\n\nOn the other side, the combat is good. I've chosen warrior class and was happy to see how enemies flew away from me whenever I hit them. I felt like a true hero, an unstoppable force who can slay enemies by dozens. The beginning of the game was a bit hard and boring, but after unlocking some powerful skills which could heal me and kill many enemies at the same time, the game began to be fun. The graphics is also good, in my opinion. As for the soundtrack, it does good job to enhance the grim atmosphere of the game.\n\nBeside the warrior class, there are two other classes that you can play- mage and rogue. There are also a few side quests you can complete. The story isn't bad, but I think it's role is something that will motivate you to go further, not something that you will remember.","April 29, 2015","false","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
