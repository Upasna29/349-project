This game isn't really good.\n\nThe storyline is quite hard to follow, especially with all the funky names and stuff.\n\nThe gamplay is very simple. Pause the game, click your actions / press the hotkeys, unpause the game, and watch. There is some lag even when you don't actively pause the game, and this gets rather irritating when you want to band-aid/heal the characters. It kinda sucks that you can't heal yourself, and you need another character to do that.\n\nThe camera is awkward and clunky, and you might have problems moving your troops/team around due to the camera positioning. Although you get to rotate the camera, it doesn't feel natural.\n\nWhat is good about this game is that it is short. There are only 3 chapters (according to the Steam achievements). However, paying $19.99 for a short game isn't that worth the money. I would rather you spend it on X:Com. But that is just my opinion.\n\n","November 26, 2013","false","9.4"," 123 of 140 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","123","140","0","0"

In that regard, in making some micromanagement of skills, buffs, debuffs, AoE, etc, I'd say it's quite alright and even unforgiving on the player. It's not a D&D title, it's a B-series game, but if taken for what it is and graphics, story and such is put apart and the tacticality of the gameplay is highlighted, can be an interesting title to play.\n\nWhen the game was over, though, I felt a bit tedious of it, I didn't even play the extra maps since I was so fed up! The campaign is way too long! I don't recommend playing it in long runs, as it can be a bit repetitive, most game is just linear walking and encountering battles.\n\nI don't think it's worth the full price, I got it in a bundle and for that I believe it is more than acceptable.\n\nConsidering it is a mixed bag, I cannot recommend it for the average player. But if searching for a challenge, do take a look at it (in a bundle!), and for that kind of player I'll give a "yes".","January 18, 2014","true","42.2"," 80 of 101 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","80","101","6","0"

You will face few choices throughout the game the biggest being which generic heroes you want to use at any given time.\n\nWhat ever happend to the deep RPGs? The ones driven by skill, story and exploration?\n\nIn Confrontation you take control of a number of Griffin Hero's as they travel through various hostile lands in the search of secret enemy cloning labs. Although the back story and lore in the world of Confrontation seems pretty interesting the game never manages to portray it in a favorable light. Everything is locked into classic fantasy stereotypes and even the slight steampunk elements feels bland and unimpressive.\n\nThe gameplay is your standard team based action RPG, you control 4 heroes that level up as you go along and upgrade their various abilities. Unfortunately the strength and usefulness of the heroes and their abilities are quite skewered and many of them is not worth using outside of their required sections. On normal difficulty almost all of the fights can be won by simply clicking attack on the enemies as they pop up although some micro management is required that is mainly due to the horrendous AI that makes your heroes go idle at the end of their action unless they are literally standing next to an enemy.\n\nGraphics and sound are of the lower end of the "We actually spent money on it" range and generally UI and menus seem slightly dated and underdeveloped.\n\nI'd love to have evaluated the multi-player but nobody seems to be playing and looking around on the official forums this seems to have been the case from day one.\n\nAll in all this is a game to avoid. It's boring and bland and has little to recommend it. The developers have had no interest in supporting it past release and there is no community to make multi-player a viable gamemode. Truly a wasted purchase.","January 14, 2013","false","40.0"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

At first it didnt seem like it was going to hold my interest.  There are many lands, peoples and places which use alot of obtuse names.  Fortunately, the story is very well narrated, so even if you have difficulty keeping track of things, it moves right along with the narration.  The game is somewhat linear and introduction of other playable characters helps to offset the feeling of redundancy and or repitition.  Graphic are nice but character control in narrow and tight areas can be somewhat problematic.  There were a couple of maps that had the old "can't unlock the door unless you pull a lever from a far off room" scenario.  I was not to keen on the games that implemented this problematic scenario back in the day and I am not giving the game any bonus points for using it.  The story was ok, something bout men, orcs and genetically modified scorpians and machines or something (as I said, lotsa obtuse names).  At least it was well narrated. lol\nNot a bad game, but don't expect much and you wont be dissapointed.","December 18, 2013","true","46.9"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","0"

I just can't stand playing it anymore. Confrontation is supposed to be a Tactical RPG. However, there are huge problems with both the Tactics, and the RPG. It just seems very rushed and unpolished.\n\nI'll only write about 2 general points: Story and Combat.\n\nRegarding the Story, this game seems to have a huge lore. That lore is, of course, necessary to understand what's happening. However, they decided to give you access to it through pages and pages of text in the menu... I doubt anyone will read those out of nowhere. It's clearly for the people already familiar with the universe.\nBesides, all the exposition is through narrated walls of texts. It's just like getting a few pages of an audiobook between each mission. It's completely separated from the game itself.\n\nNow, about the Combat. First off, it's clunky as hell. I've played a few tactical games like this before. The fact that this game is in Real-Time rather than Turn-Based only hurts it. I've played Krater, though, and however flawed, that game feels good to play. Where this fails is that it's completely unresponsive, in the literal sense of the word. You command your character to do something, and they generally just ignore it. Either that, or they take several seconds. After those seconds, someone important has already died, so tough luck.\nThe abilities also have long cooldowns, meaning you'll only be able to use them one -- twice at most -- per encounter.\nThe level design is also just a corridor with combat after combat. Sometimes you'll have to press levers, but that's about it.\n\n\nMaybe I'm not giving it a fair enough chance and it gets better later on. After 6 hours, however, it feels just like I'm starting with it, and the game has done nothing interesting... and I can withstand not interesting, as long as it still feels good to play. With the clunky mechanics at play here, though, I won't.\n\n\nI doubt this is very helpful, but hey, the fact that I don't have any intention of continuing with it should give you an idea.","January 30, 2015","false","6.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaptainBipto/recommended/204560/","CaptainBipto","CaptainBipto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaptainBipto/","79 products in account","I am only part way through this game at the moment. Having bought this title on the holiday sale 75% off for £3.74. Compared to its regular list price of £14.99.\n\nWould I recommend this game, the answer would be no. There are better action rpg titles around for the same price. It does feel clunky at times. There are pathing issues. though I do like the visuals, the lore and some of the mechanics. That is why I picked up Aarklash: Legacy to give this series another chance.\n\nIf you have bought this title, and are having issues with reading the manual. For some reason, the manual is not accessible via the right hand menu in the library. So you will have to google steam powered + confrontation manual to get it.\n\nThere are no loot drops what so ever. You can only upgrade armor and weapons via weapon stands. Which are located sporadically around the various maps. Other upgrades include glyphs, which are obtained via plinths a giant magic rock.\n\nMain Screen - On the campaign menu there is an Additional Content button, but when selecting it. There is nothing listed, and I cannot find anything regarding additional content.\n\nThe main menu is located right at the bottom of the screen. Where you can access options, switching profile and quiting the game. It looks out of place on the main screen, compared to the other buttons. Which have a UI element to them.\n\nGameplay\nNaration - The naration feels like the old pen and paper DM, explaining things to you. Other than that it is uninspired.\n\nUser Interface - In game with the party interface it does look nice and clean. Though the minimap is rather lackluster, even worse when bringing up the full map. You cannot zoom into the map. Though it does leave white dots showing where you have been on the map. It does seem out of place compared to the rest of the UI.\n\nCharacter Panels - Pressing I gives you the character panel, which shows you their attributes, skills, armor etc.. One gripe is it does not include all of the stats. Which are on a seperate panel pressing O. So you will not be able to see when increasing attributes what they are improving. The tooltips on attributes do specify what they improve. Also their class should be on the panel as well.\n\nSkills and Armor - I would have liked a way to respec my characters, this feature is in Aarklash: Legacy. So I can make the party I want, with the builds I want.\n\nHealing - Some characters have a heal over time. Others have an aoe heal. There is the option of using bandages to heal. But you can only use them on other characters, not on yourself. Frustration can set in when due to pathing you cannot reach the character you want to bandage.\n\nCodex - Only accessible in the main menu, and not while you are playing the game. Also they have missed adding lore and character biographies to the character entries. Character entries only have a visual model of the character, plus a list of their abilities. In Aarklash: Legacy you are able to examine enemy units and their abilities.\n\nCombat - Rushing blindly into rooms, will definitely get your party killed in this game. Some fights do take some strategy on what to focus on, what to crowd control. Line of sight, and pulling groups away from patrols. So you do not end up in some crazy cluster frak wipe, when a party member gets feared. Combat is mainly pausing, chaining some commands, such as move here, attack this, use this ability for each party member. Unpause then watch the fight unfold, pause and reissue commands when required.\n\nMultiplayer - I have not tried multiplayer, but according to the forums and how this title was recieved. Do not expect any.\n\nI do not know what the original price listing was for this title at launch. This title does feel unfinished, and would need more polish. Personally I would not have released this title as is. It should have undergone some closed or open beta testing. Taken onboard player feedback and improved this title immeasurably.\n\nAnyone who has played this title and has not gone all angry german kid. Deserves medals and a parade, Personally I think it is worthy of a visit by an Enforcer droid and vaporized. Am I going to play the game to the end, yes I am. To see if anything can be redeemed before summary vaporizing.","December 29, 2013","true","6.4"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","0"

For a game that came out in mid 2012 I might've expected more.\n\nThe story and concept is great, I love top-down squad-based semi turn based RPGs. But so much of this game feels...distant, remote, clinical, uncaring of even itself. Roughly ten or fifteen minutes into the game a prompt pops up that says, and you can quote me on this, "You now know enough to play the game."  ... Thanks. But usually that's decided through experience when one sees how often they die. Or at the end when the scores are tallied. I know I'm misusing their phrasing here, but my point is this; why break the third wall for the sake of saying "And now I, the game, am done giving you, the player, instructions about how to interact with me, the game. Isn't this fun? LAUGH! BE GLEEFUL!" It's like being told "Okay, the examination is over, you can put your pants back on." Such a statement never follows something enjoyable or personally involved. First impressions out of the way, I will genuinely be surprised if I come back for much more of Confrontation and can't recommend it to anyone who hasn't first played all of the other great, personable, emotionally connected RPGs out there from years gone by. Ultimately, I think confrontation is a dollar short and a decade late.","January 16, 2014","false","0.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I like games that offer gameplay and variety over graphics and storylines tho i do enjoj good story lines. Overall this game is not that bad if u want an RPG with semi good graphics. The game is not turn based its more like neverwinter nights style of gameplay, it takes time to hit, move or cast a spell once ur in combat but outside it you move normaly. Each unit has its own spells, weapons and skills. The camera is a ♥♥♥♥♥, its glytchi sometimes get stuck and wont move, controls are a pain because sometimes the selection cyrcle gets stuck, sometimes u wana select 1 unit but it wont it just keeps selecting the same one over and over, sometimes you group your units into group 1 but when u press number 1 1-2/5 times it wont work, sometimes characters run to pull a lever for around 20 secs eaven if they stand right infront of it... Overall if u can look pass these few errors the game is not that bad and its enjojable. Combat is hard, u need good tactics and planing ahead is the onli thing keeping u alive most of the time, your units are not much stronger than enemies so the combat is pretty balanced, when u go 4v4 u can lose very easy or win just by an inch from losing. If the game is in a bundle or on sale and ur bored pick it up and try it, just give it time, pass 1-2 chapters before u give up.","December 31, 2014","true","0.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

The textures were fantastic for a game made in 1981, the game was clearly optimised to run on a high-end system, with the best teleporting and stutterstepping available that would make wizards and top FPS players jealous.\n\nThe only problem I can see, and the only reason I'm giving the game 11/10 instead of 12/10 is that Darius clearly does not use an axe.

My fault for not delving into video reviews first.  Could have been better if the other races were playable in anything other than multiplayer.  I don't care about the main faction the campaign revolves around so most of the game is rubbish to me.

This game will help you discover how that feels when you are using your skills; no sound ques.\n\nDid you ever wonder what it feels like when your cat doesn't obey your commands? That's exactly how the units you control behaves throughout the game.\n\nDid you ever wonder about those times when you were already sleepy and then you somehow move a little slower with every minute passing? Well, that's here in this game as well as it somehow suffers from a sleep disorder.\n\nDid you ever wonder what it feels like to read a novel? This game has you covered with its engaging text walls that challenge you to in explaining something very simple such as basic controls and the like.\n\nAll in all, this is the kind of game that reminds you of the beauty in the outside world. But if you insist on playing a game of this genre, just get a Warhammer game instead.\n","May 4","false","1.0"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
