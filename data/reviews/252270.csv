You control only 2 units of a fixed size of respawning zombies, 1 monster who levels and gains 4 abilities, and your leader in a mobile base where the zombies respawn.\n\nThe art style and music both make the game fun to play, it's just unfortunate the gameplay itself lets it down.  With so few units to control and no real abilities to trigger besides the over-powered monster you don't always have, the game is too simple and stops being fun very quickly.","January 2, 2014","false","2.1"," 210 of 260 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","210","260","0","7"

Not a clue why they did that, even after reading up on why they did do that). Your first run through the game’s 8 mission campaign, which is broke up between 2 different factions of 6 different types of zombies for 4 missions each, will only be about 3-4 hours. There is some replay value in obtaining all the secondary objects if you missed them the first time around but replaying the entire campaign again might only increase the life of this title to about 6-7 hours. It is a relatively cheap title though so I’d say dollar-per-hour value is ok with this one. The real feature I say about this title, which initially sold me and kept me going through til the end, is the graphic style and the crazy amount of character put into almost every aspect of the game. Every unit in the game has a ton of personality which is more than I can say for a lot of others games. The two scientists and their zombie minions made me chuckle several times in every cutscene. The way the game looks and sounds reminds me a lot of Evil Genius which is an amazing game so good off to whoever created all the models and behaviours of all the characters.\nIn conclusion I’d fully recommend this game to anybody looking for a cheap, simple RTS that is exploding with charm and personality and I really hope this company makes a sequel, a real tycoon game or another RTS, with expanded mechanics aimed at a PC market.\n","December 12, 2013","true","4.0"," 75 of 87 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","75","87","0","0"

It is not a zombie management game like the tycoon title would have you believe, you won't make a money making business of it. It is very easy to pick up and play (especially with a controller). Despite its zombie theme, it feels like it was meant for kids. Its pretty easy and instead of horrific blood and gore, there is a cute cartoony art style along with humorous animated skipable, cut scenes. Its like watching a cartoon with characters that convey so much without saying a word and I'm happy with that.\n\nWhen the game starts, the zombie apocalypse has already happened. It seems to be a mutant zombie apocalypse that has turned creatures rather than former people. Your allies will even be a mutated badger, disfigured bear, some sort of creature car and a robot. Basically stated, there are two feuding factions of zombies, the green shamblers and the feral blues. The shamblers seem slower with more HP and the feral blues seem quicker with less HP.\n\nCaught between the two feuding factions are the humans. There are easy to kill civilians, police officers with batons or guns, soldiers that take and give heavy damage. There are even thick bodied hill billies with shotguns that will insta kill lesser zombies with their double barrel.\n\nThe controls are simple and very controller friendly, since this was originally a console game. Left thumb stick to move the camera, right thumb stick to zoom in or out and rotate. Left bumper brings you to a map of the entire area and your objectives. The face buttons control your groups, two face buttons command two zombie squads. one group is your commander that if he dies, its a game over, but the game is very forgiving and lets you try from the last checkpoint. The commander will eventually be permanently upgraded to have a sentry gun with a wide radius and his vehicle will spawn zombies. The bottom 'group' is your 'hero' I'll call it, the mutant thing with powers and a lot of energy. The D-pad controls the special powers of the hero characters. The heroes gain experience to unlock these skills and there are brief cool downs when a skill is used. The heroes seems a little brainless and need your commands, while the zombies will attack enemies in range, but not buildings.\n\nThrough the campaign, you first play as the shambling zombies, then you will play the feral zombies at around chapter 4. They don't play any different really, but their stories are different. The feral zombie story begins before the shambling zombie story, so they are told out of order in the campaign. The objectives are pretty simple, go here, take over this, attack that. Its all marked on your map and there are arrows so you'll always know the general area where they are. There is fog of war of unexplored areas, so there is a need to explore.\n\nLike many RTS, you can command your horde of zombies to take over houses, tool stores and towers. When you take over something other than a tower or house, you can command your zombies go in and the entire group of zombies will become a different type. Engineers come from tool stores and they can interact with objects on the map, but have no real difference. Flower zombies can be hidden, travel quickly and wait for someone to walk into their trap, brawlers have heavy HP, but less damage per second, Samurai have high DPS, but can't move as quick, throwers well throw things, damaging buildings more than anything. There are other types, but you get the picture. The game has an easy to use codex (bestiary) of monsters, factions and buildings.\n\nWhen you take over towers, they give you more map visibility and throw items down on enemies. Finally, the homes are seemingly the most important, they spawn non controlled zombies that will just do their own thing. They'll take over other houses or attack other zombies for you. If you ever need to summon all of those non controlled zombies to one place, the right bumper will call them in a 'dead rush,' but there's a long cooldown and it rarely feels useful. The enemy faction can retake buildings, human soldiers and hillbillies can liberate buildings from zombie control, so there is a tug of war there.\n\nIts not just the art style and humor that set this game apart from other RTS, it has different sections that I feel deviate from the normal RTS, such as one on one boss fights with patterns, so its not just two 'hero' characters knocking on one another. There are also chapters with stealth aspects, avoiding an enemy view radius and hiding in bushes as they pass by. On top of traditional RTS maps, there is usually something interesting happening, such as burrowing badgers that after a countdown will pop up to eat your zombies and a massive zombie straight laser that will go off every so often to cut through your troops. These are nice layers on top of a simple and easy to play RTS.\n\nWith all of that being said, I feel the art style might really hold someone back from getting this game. It is a cute and charming style that fits the cartoon humor. I can hope this studio gets a Disney game license in the future. Not everyone is into cartoon charm. Other than on the surface, this is a very easy, shallow RTS, better for kids, but is easy really so bad? In a $1 bundle its a great game and maybe for a younger audience its worth the $10 to play a 6 hour campaign, but there are better RTS out there.","October 16, 2014","true","11.4"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cublikefoot/recommended/252270/","cublikefoot","cublikefoot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cublikefoot/","2402 products in account","Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/zombie-tycoon-2-brainhovs-revenge-game-review/\n\nZombie Tycoon 2: Brainhov’s Revenge is a simple strategy game. No idea why “tycoon” is included in the title; makes the game look like a simulator. The fact that it’s Zombie Tycoon should immediately tell you that this is not your average tycoon game that you’re familiar with. One of the leaders does have “Tycoon” in his name, so that may be the case here.\n\nI spent the majority of my time with this game playing multiplayer with my friend. He figured out the game far quicker than I did, and I ended up with several losses and not a single win. We were placed into the game with four different “units”, two of which were groups of zombies. These were our primary offensive (and possibly defensive) units. The other two units consisted of your “leader” in a mobile HQ and a special unit. In the games we played, our objective was to prevent the death of our mobile HQ unit, while attempting to eliminate the other team’s mobile HQ.\n\nOnce your mobile HQ is gone, the game is over and the opposing side wins. During my first round, I made a very bad move by instructing my HQ to follow all of my other units, which consisted of my zombies and my special unit, which was a giant, mutated badger. In order to get more zombies, I was tasked with capturing the numerous buildings scattered around the map and taking any that the enemy may have already captured. Each building captured added to a counter in the corner of the screen. This counter shows how many zombies were at my disposal when I initiated a rush-like attack.\n\nThis rush attack summoned all zombies available to me to a specified location. In my case, I usually summoned this large mass of zombies to attack the enemy’s HQ or a big building in combination with my special unit. The only downside to the multiplayer portion of the game is that it lacks the complexity offered by the singleplayer mode. The singleplayer mode offers a lot more than that of the multiplayer. I really wish that the multiplayer mode offered some of the cool aspects from singleplayer.\n\nThe game has a great singleplayer campaign, and, although it may have been short, it played more like an RTS than the multiplayer mode did. It was very satisfying to command a rush of 30 zombies. Very, very satisfying.\n\nThe game’s graphics were great. Very cartoon-esque. I should also mention the game’s music and sound. Both were on par, not too spectacular, but not bad. The main menu music is not really memorable, which was a shame, but the “voice” acting was hilarious in the singleplayer campaign.\n\nI highly recommend Zombie Tycoon 2: Brainhov’s Revenge for RTS fans who enjoy a simple formula over a complicated one.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0KMHFIA54U","December 14, 2013","true","5.8"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","40","51","0","0"

Do not let the name fool you, this game has nothing to do with building an empire or formulating a grand strategy. There are 8 chapters, each about 30 minutes or so long. Each chapter consists of one map with a series of objectives that must be completed in order to advance.\n\nThe controls definitely make this feel like it was created with consoles in mind. You only ever have 4 units at most and each special character/monster will have 4 abilities. Good for consoles or just playing with a controller, rather limiting when you have a keyboard. Without all that many units, controls aren’t really an issue here. A minor complaint would be that there doesn’t appear to be a way to create groups, except by repeatedly dragging the mouse over the units you want. The game also offers multiplayer but I have not tried it and thus cannot comment on it.\n\nWithout going into spoilers the general plot is that you play as a mad scientist who is trying to wipe out humanity with your army of zombies. Fun and simple. The visual style is very Tim Schaeffer. While not laugh out loud hilarious, I found the game to be thoroughly amusing despite the fact that no character ever says a word. The entire story is given through various sounds, looks, and actions; no dialogue.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my 5 or so hours with Zombie Tycoon 2. If it sounds interesting and you can get it at a good price I think it would be worth your while.","February 21, 2015","true","5.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

The campaign has only 8 missions, which are typically very, very ... slow. You have only 2 squads and a monster (which is less interesting than it sounds). The AI is pretty bad (granted they are zombies, but still). Plenty of times my zombies were just standing somewhere while my houses were being taken over or my leader unit slapped up. The cutscenes are funny, but that's pretty much what you get for your hard earned money. It is definately a nice starting point for a game, with more squads, some more skills (your leader is now just a respawn point) and maybe some more ... gameplay. It could be nice, who knows a patch or DLC will someday makes this game worth the money. For now, I'd spend it on something else.

Great twist to a RTS game,  you as a mad scientists control faction of zombies and monsters that you created. Frima Studio have done a great job bringing a unique RTS with zombies.\nYou control the game with four different “units”, two of which are groups of zombies. These two are primary units for attack or defence. Leader Tycoon or Brainhov along with monster form the other two units. The basic objective in multiplayer games is to kill other leader in his mobile HQ while protecting your leader in his mobile HQ.\nYou also command a special power of rush attack. The power of rush attack depends upon how many houses you captured on the map. Each house you capture results in increase in zombie counter present at the screen at all times. Greater the value of counter, more powerful the rush attack will be.\nThe rush attack summons all the zombies to a specific locations. Best to use this attack to demolish rivals HQ or capture key buildings on map. There is a cool down period after every rush attack to recover lost zombies, so use the attack wisely. Multiplayer is loads of fun but here is lack of online players , so you have to wait quite a while to get a match.  Also more multiplayer maps would have added to the enjoyment factor of online matches.\nThe game has a great single player campaign, and, although it may have been short. The story is also interesting with well timed humour to keep you entertained. The story begins with Tycoon taking over a Human Colony and suddenly Brainhov comes back for revenge against Tycoon. Campaign Story is divided into chapters . All RTS elements are perfectly utilised in the campaign.\nBased on unreal engine, the game provides great visuals for a RTS . The cartoon styled graphics are a perfect match for humour filled story. The background music and sounds work well but nothing to write home about here. Overall all aspects of game work well in cohesion and provide a great RTS game. HGunified recommends Zombie Tycoon 2: Brainhov’s Revenge to all RTS fans who enjoy a good RTS game with fun-to-play multiplayer coupled with well written story.

One big one being at the boss at the end of the game where your character is frozen, allowing the boss to get 2 free shots off on you AND the camra there is out of control, but besides that most of the game runs pretty well.\n\nThe only major issue I had was trying to get it to run. For some reason, having cloud enabled maked it unplayable and it continues to try and install a file that, I assume, doesn't exsist as I would leave it for well over 8 hours and nothing would've happened. This was what fixed it for me, disableing the cloud save.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun little game to cut some time off and as it's zombies you have there's not much of a stategy beyond mob the enemies with more and bigger beasties!","April 22, 2015","true","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The tutorial is longer than it needs to be considering there isn't anything to learn. Due to the fact that this game is a skeleton, with small chunks of meat here and there. Don't waste your money like I did, even if it is just $2.50. Gameplay is bland and there is no freedom. Not even really an RTS. No control, no "real" abilities and while the art is very fun and the cutscenes are comical there is nothing else to this game. There is no Zombie diversity, only 5-6 different types, which, isn't too bad. But the enemy types are less, at about 3-4. Think about 8 chapters lasting over 20 minutes a piece of the same enemies and same objectives every time. That's all it is. There isn't even much creativity, or ingenuity, for the matter. Please, don't make the mistake of buying this game. It isn't a Tycoon or an RTS.

I had some aswell, but this kind of stuff happens. I fixed it using the knowledge of google, soooooo most of negative reviews, are people too stupid/lazy to use google and fix the crashes, using google knowledge.\n\nThe game\n\nThe plot is about two very diffrent zombie factions, each with their own leader, wanting to be the ultimate zombie masters. The factions are in a war of sort and in the middle of it there are some leftovers of human race. The gameplay is a RTS style, althou some mechanics are really weird and require practise and getting used to. The whole game feels like one of these horror movies that make you laugh. The cutscenes are awsome and the "characters" have cartoon personality, making it even more funny.\n\nIt took me about 13hrs to complete the main story in 100%, so its kinda short, but the missions are mastered visualy and in gameplay i dont see any flaws if there are any. There is also a multiplayer feature which is really fun to play, that is if you find another player which is rare, but im always up for a match :D So add me if you want some multiplayer.\n\nhighly recommended, one of the best games i played in the last year :)","February 13, 2015","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's different of other zombie subject game. In another word, the zombie is cute :) .\nThe most impressive part of this game to me is the Chapter 8 ( the last chaper).
