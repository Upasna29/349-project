In the single player it makes you feel cunning and smart but is still tough! While in the multiplayer you get annihilated. But the biggest and best feature of this game is... the editor! It is very useable and powerful you could use it for a great mission or you can just have silly fun! (Most of the time I'm doing the second) My only complaint is the defence missions! No matter what you do you either win or lose it's a matter of luck! When you have a line of defence and a enemy army there is nothing to do besides watch and hope it does well!

No tutorials or anything. just the same graphics, interface (simplified a bit) and even some of the music. Pick it up and off you go. If you didnt play Faces of War you will have a small learning curve ahead of you but no worries. The simplified UI is good and hints still work.\n\nGame is nevertheless just as awesome as Faces of War. i have now completed the most entertaining and somewhat challenging Soviet campaign and i had a blast. Just try to ignore the laughable voice acting in cut-scene videos. It's the strategy and fun with a full physics engine that matters the most.\n\nThis is how RTS should be done. Buy it. Ignore the age of the title. It is as fresh as a daisy even in 2015.\n\nIf you can't decide which one to grab, this one or Faces of War i recommend Faces first as that one is heavily squad based. This game introduces reinforcements and multiple flashpoints you need to keep tabs on (pause key is more important than ever) and you have entire companies at your disposal. There is also the biggest negative about this game. In Faces of War your AI allies did the fighting and your men assisted in the flanks mostly. now you manage it all.

Watching your tank rounds pinging off of a Panzer's armor is pretty scary, and Angles and armor thickness play a part in it too.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sodacanman/recommended/7830/","sodacanman","Tommy The Jerk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sodacanman/","87 products in account","You may think this game is good at first. You may think that me having clocked in over 200 hours means it must be good. But really, this game is like cocaine. You'll use it once, think it's interesting, then keep going. Soon you'll know it's bad, and that it's just constantly killing you, but you'll keep going, hoping it'll go back to the good it once seemed to be. If you're lucky like me, you'll escape and never play this again.\n\nLet me explain my opinion a little more. This game is essentially an RTS with guns, tanks and artillery. That's fun and fine in itself, at least on paper, but it necessitates a few things. For example, if you have troops with guns, you expect that they'll be able to shoot enemies, and generally get things done without your constant aid. Not in Men of War. Your troops will frequently throw grenades into their own squads, waste ammo shooting at nothing (yeah, you have to keep track of every troop's ammo), miss enemies at point blank range, stare at the last sighted enemy even if they're miles out of range, stop running in favor of standing in a field trying to shoot an invisible sniper, or just flat out do something that makes no sense. This is only the beginning.\n\nYour tanks fare even worse. There is literally no way to use them apart from taking direct control of the tank, the AI for it is that useless. This limits you to having pretty much one tank on the battlefield at a time. This would be reasonable, except that the game's terribly designed engine starts to really kick in now. Even while you desperately try to aim at an enemy vehicle, your shots will typically bounce off, or just flatout prove useless, while later, while not even trying, a .50 cal will destroy the same tank with ease. The game is just littered with inconsistencies, all the while trying desperately to cling to realism. And once again, this is just the beginning.\n\nIn trying to move away, so as to hopefully avoid some shots, you'll find that the terrain is just as poorly built. Tanks will simply stop at steep inclines, and will actually become a physics object upon colliding with a rock, juttering out of control for a crucial second or two, regardless of how hard your brushed against it, while it will have no problem pummelling through a block of buildings. Speaking of buildings, some, and it seems more or less entirely random, will never be properly broken and will stay standing even after you've barraged the area with artillery, while some will crumble after a few grenades come near it.\n\nThere's also a huge issue with balance, with the Soviets (possibly in accordance with reality) getting not only the best tanks, but also getting them the cheapest. Forget what you've heard about American tanks being cheap, they are the most expensive to field. Germany is the only nation that can compete; Japan and Britain might as well not be playable. In theory, the American infantry is better than the Soviet, but in practice this is only true for basic infantry. Elite infantry finds home with the Soviets again, who pretty much decimate all other units, until you bring in tanks, where once again, the Soviets take the cake. You'd think maybe some artillery would take out them out, but it proves rather fruitless, because they also get very good light vehicles, which will take out whatever artillery you have.\n\nThis is all without even getting into the abomination that is the single player mode. The voice acting is cringeworthy; nearly on par with Zelda CDI. The difficulty curves make no sense, ranging from Niagra Falls drops, to brick wall inclines, and there's an extremely shallow learning curve, with the tutorial teaching you only a quarter of what you actually need to know to play effectively. On top of that, the singleplayer AI is completely insane, relying more on fielding impossibly large amounts of units than actually being able to control any.\n\nBut I could go on forever. I'm going to cut my time spent with this game short and now try my best never to think of it again. Do yourself a favour and don't ever touch this game.","July 31, 2013","false","245.1"," 70 of 110 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","70","110","5","6"

Unlike COH2 where all you do is defend objectives, or wipe out enemy strongholds, which gets old, you have a different scenario on your hands every mission. Level editor? 10/10 Love it! I spend most of my time in the editor! It allows you to create any kind of battle you'd like! Want to defend an airfield? Boom! There you go! (With a little help from youtube this should be quite simple to figure out) Want to assault a German fortress? Build it, then blow it! Want to create a chaotic battle between every faction in the game? Spawn the units, start the editor, and there you have it! And last but not least the skirmish capabilities! 0/10 There aren't any. If you want to battle an A.I. you'll have to play Level Editor.

Graphics, for 2009, are quite good, explosions are well done, and it is played in real-time. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is smart, but can be overcome as it tends to repeat most of its moves at each mission restart (predictability). But, you will be CHALLENGED to get through some of the missions and strategy will be required as the enemy will change its strategy in ways that you may not expect. The AI will provide some "surprises" which makes it entertaining. It will keep you alert (situation awareness) and busy planning your strategy. I found it to be quite ENGAGING and felt determined to finish it - and did. It has been 5 years since I played it, but I remember it as one of my favorites in this genre.

It has probably about the most realistic gameplay you will ever get from an RTS and it can be very fun to play. Watch out though, although not incredibly complicated it IS a hard game, even more so if you, like me, refuse to play on easy. Ever.\nAlthough the voice-acting is terrible, the graphics are aged and the interface is not to write home about either, making the micromanagement (which is pretty much something you are constantly doing when playing Men of War) a little frustrating at times, the gameplay overall is really good. Also, it makes it all the more rewarding when successfully finishing a mission.\n\nThe singleplayer covers 3 campaigns (Soviet, German, Allied), consisting out of 19 missions total, and 5 non-linear bonus missions. As of now, I am busy doing the Soviet one, which will probably take me quite some time to finish, for the missions are really long and hard. The storylines cover some of the less famous battles of WW2, all squad-based.\n\nAll in all, if a challenging and realistic (relatively) modern warfare RTS is what you are looking for, you cannot go wrong with Men of War, even more so with the ridiculous price tag of €5,-. Less if you buy it on sale and/or in a package. Men of War is a VERY unique RTS and probably one of the best I ever played.","February 20","true","26.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","11","12","3","0"

This game is definetly a 10 out of 10 and 5 of 5 stars.\n\nyou will not be dissapointet if you going to like a high replay abilty.\n(play and doing your missions in your way or with the craziest tactics you can ever think of)\n\nThe diffuculty changes from camaping to campaing and missions to missions too. from easy to the imposseble. (depening on your tactics)\n\nYou can do stealth in Men of War and it is relaible, not like an another RtS game has to fired on many times while here you can take them out with a one single silent hit.\n\nThey include an advanced system for vechiles that let you see the shells bounce off from shots to shots.\n\nAnd best of all, direct fire. controll your aim on your selected solider or tank and shoot to get the kills and make an advantage on your battlefield.\n\nMen of War has is hard to learn in the start, my exsperience when i first played the mission number one, i failed endlessy. when i devolopet a tactic that will work it began to be more and more advanced, while i am imroving for hours and hours. Men of war might not be for evryone but if you loved to play Company of Heroes you would defenitly like this one.\n\nI definetly recommend you to try out Demo if you are not sure about to buy Men of War. I palyed 1 month on the demo for i was adicted to the game.

I can even loot Pumas and get MG34s with 1000-count ammo.\n\nIf the campaign is too hard, try the editor. Endless fun!\n\nAlso Serious ReviewBest war game ever made. I bought Men of War seeing video of humourous battles of 100 X versus 1000 Y but also I never tried RTS and the only WWII game I ever played (on PC) is GMod modded sillyness. But I though, I oughta try it out. I started the campaign and had to terrorize a Russian village filled with Germans. Failed all three of my attempts, but I saw the editor and gave it a go.\n\nThats when the game stole my life.\n\nIm here a few months from now, I got mods and learned how to fly planes in MOW, the tactics, gamplay, even campaign/mission building.

Men of War is one of gaming's first autobiographical games which follows the heavy metal band Manowar from their inception during the 1980s. The game has a beautiful opening scene wherein the player controls bassist Joey DeMaio while he snorts the biggest line of cocaine in his life while backstage at a Black Sabbath concert, and neglects to fulfill his duties as a sober fireworks manager. In this sequence the player must complete a series of quick-time-events in order to guide a stumbling Demaio into correctly setting off the fireworks in order to not burn the stage down. During this sequence the quick-time-events get harder to the point where the player cannot complete them, which reveals that Ross the Boss is right beside you and like a true bro, covers over for DeMaio and succeeds in not causing the death of Ronnie James Dio. DeMaio and Ross the Boss become best bros at that moment and start legendary metal band Manowar.\n\nThe rest of the game is a re-tooled version of Activision's Guitar Hero, but all of the songs are from Manowar.","July 6, 2013","true","0.2"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

There is no win all weapon it's how you use it. For instance, I used to never spawn any vehicles other  than a puma, for this reason, every person I had to fight, would have a much slower and less agile counterpart. Simply hide the puma behind a building lets say, send infantry to distract his piece of steel, send in the puma when he isn't looking, and there you go you just wrecked a 100 point tank with a  25 point scout vehicle.

You can do more things, for example, steal enemy vehicles and weapons, and with the line of sight, stealth is sometimes a viable option.

The singleplayer is fun with diversed missions that are time comsuming and rewarding. Some of them are really great especially with the Soviets. The stealth missions are pretty bad though and doesn't work very well. I spend like 10 hours trying to complete a US stealth mission and failed. I ended up using the cheats mod to complete it. Multiplayer is fun and the main focus of the game. The modes of the multiplayer are good and it runs smoothly on my computer. i spent most of my time there.

There's a great deal of call for strategic and tactical teamwork, timing and use of wits. You can equip every trooper individually, use vehicles, commandeer enemy vehicles by killing the crew and fixing them up. The objectives for each mission range from plain assaulting enemy positions to stealthy approaches, mining, holding strategic positions until help arrives or your comrades have evacuated key personnel.

It is not for the faint of heart though. It has a more strategic depth to it compared to most RTS. You cant just hit a tank from the front and expect to blow it up. You have to attack its sides and and tracks to impair its movement and hit its weak points. It is a great game. Usually i play with just infantry to avoid vehicle combat. I would reccomend this game possibly get the new one assault squad it is probably better than this one however you cant go wrong with this one or assualt squad!

The campain is extremely difficult due to the fact that you units do not respawn and you can not summon or build more units throughout the campain, and when they die you will have to salvage their helmets, ammo, and weapons off of them in order to keep you force moving forward and well supplied. Another cool feature that factors into combat in this game is that wherever you hit an armored target it factors the damage you would do to it through the amour thickness, the side you hit it on, and the size of the round you are hitting it with. Then after all of that is factored into your attack, it can cause the armored target to become immobile, kill part of the crew, make it slower, disable the gun, or event destroy the armored target completly. Now although I found this game to be quite fun, it is not for the faint of heart as this game is extreamly hard and it took me quite a while to get past the first couple of levels. But, if you are looking for an rts with teeth that will laugh at you evertime you fail this game is for you. 8/10","January 30, 2014","true","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Men of War is one of those games from Eastern Europe.  And like Stalker and Metro 2033, this game is surprisingly good for being developed by a small Ukrainian based company.\n\nThis is a really strange RTS/RPGS/FPS Hybrid.  It's mainly a stragety game but it involves RPG elements like inventory management and such, theres also some features in there to take control of individual untis like an action game.\n\nThe editor is fairly easy to use and the battles are extremley realistic, but fun at the same time.

It's more like a real time tactics game since you give units specific orders with specific inventories.\n\nAnyway, I can't advise buying this after just playing the first level. I know it's not much, but when:\n\n- Your units won't make decently intelligent decisions on cover fire and throwing grenades at machine gun nests or armored cars while the pause button requires unpausing and selecting new units manually to coordinate orders,\n- Your tank randomly doesn't aim or shoot at targets for dozens of seconds at a time while shooting endlessly at other targets until you manually turn the tank a little right before the infantry with a sticky bomb gets right up to the tank (by the way, did I mention that any excess squadmates just sit on your tank while getting shot at and that your tank takes damage just from moving around?),\n- The camera angle (not pitch) becomes a pain to handle, and\n- Mission objectives require hunting down every last guy in an area rather than those guys engaging you to prevent you from running over their comrades in arms...\n\n...you know this game's bad. People will say that I'm just bad at the game, but the game actually just has really clumsy controls and doesn't respond to them half the time. It reminds me of that stupid Jagged Alliance series.\n\nIf you want to play a decent real time tactics game, I'd suggest getting Fallout Tactics.\n\nEDIT: I've played the first mission a second time, and it wasn't as bad. That said, defeating the enemy was rather ridiculous. This time, it didn't respond to my grenade attacks at all, and just let itself get blasted. The enemy had no bazookas, and its AT guns just got wrecked. The hill I had to take was pointless as well since the infantry just rushed my tank which mowed them down with its machine guns, and the convoy either got blasted to bits, or just ran by my tank. It hardly engaged, and the light tanks which did engage hardly damaged my tank even though the tracks got disabled three times. Unlike the first time I played, I was actually able to repair the tracks multiple times as well.\n\nI don't know. The game seems to suffer from black or white thinking with little balance.","January 4","false","1.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

In no other true RTS have I been able to (and indeed required to) manage the inventory of individual soldiers. Each soldier must carry a specific weapon which they may or may not be proficient at using, ammo, a helmet, bandages, and even knives or entrenchment tools. Each vehicle has fuel and ammo which can be replenished, and each seat must be manned by an individual soldier. Combine this with a fairly realistic ballistics and penetration model (infantry are REALLY vulnerable, and certain tanks simply cannot be penetrated by small rounds) and you have some very micro-heavy gameplay with a good degree of realism.\n\nThe problem is that the AI is absolutely terrible in single player, and the game pits you against laughably sized hordes of them to compensate for it. While as a history nut I loved the amount of detail and flavor in the vehicles and weapons that were available, the AI and level design undoes almost all of this. The result is a massive amount of save whoring and gamey behavior to exploit the AI. In multiplayer, the variety of units and weaponry is much appreciated, but the gameplay itself is directionless. You can capture points, but nothing you do in game can change the steady stream of points you receive which allow you to unlock more units. The variety of units and size of maps means that there is a hugely wasted opportunity here, because as long as you have the points, you can buy the most advanced tank or infantry unit from the start. There's no hierarchy or sense of progression, and points are seemingly randomly scattered throughout the maps.\n\nUltimately, Men of War has an appealing level of micro, but fails in terms of direction.","December 31, 2013","false","23.4"," 13 of 31 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","13","31","0","1"

ALSO wtf is with the fuel system in this game, the german tanks had some of the worse mileage, yet the t-34 or the sherman can only go like 250 yards? i get its balancing but then theres no way to refuel the vehicle :l then why put fuel in?! tldr this game is bad, Coh Blitzkrieg mod is more realistic than this without the crappy micromanagement that is 100x worse than any other micromanage game iv ever played","June 18, 2014","false","11.8"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","9","23","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MBC2016/recommended/7830/","MBC2016","MadBadCat [Official]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MBC2016/","117 products in account","Here is my HONEST Review.\n\nEven though it released in 2009, it isn't actually advanced. Its actually WORSE than any of the Company of Heroes Games! I Love the CoH Franchise. I even had an old set of CoH keys I could use for steam. I was expecting the same from this. Sadly it's not so. I played the first level and a Lan Game. Its not as good. I have to put those who love this game down. I read 50 People's Reviews, Tommy the Jerk's one is probably the most accurate.\n\nHere is my List of Pros and Cons of CoH and Men of War\nCompany of Heroes Pros:\n- Released in 2004 with a WWII setting that I consider\nto have Defined the WWII RTS Genre.\n- Had 2 Expansions that added multiple extras and new\narmies for munltiplayer and campaigns for singleplayer.\n- Has Got a steady defined and refined Modding\nCommnunity with mods for almost everyone.\n- Skirmishes. Just Skirmish the ever-living s**t outta Bots\n- I could go on all day, so the last Positive Pro:\nIt had and has Hundreds, if not, THOUSANDS of\nReplay value.\n\nMen of War Pros:\n- Released in 2009, not much of a pro considering the\nCons.\n- Mixed Missions? I guess....\n- Online Matchmaking and servers.... I guess...\n- Realisim... I guess\n- 99 pence was a fair deal for the game.\n\nCompany of Heroes Cons:\n- Released in 2004, Which, I admit, the graphics weren't\nthat good. They were hard to tell at some points.\n- Sometimes the Matches I played on went down or just\nstopped from lag (This was rare though)\n- I didn't find out about the modding community untill 6\nyears later. Q-Q\n- It's story, while great, wasn't perfect.\nThats really the only ones I could think of.\n\nMen of War Cons:\n(Where do I begin, well...)\n- Released in 2009, With the best Graphics, still look worse\nthan CoH @ highest settings. Pitiful.\n- WHERE ARE THE SKIRMISHES!?!?! I  WANT TO BEAT BOTS\nDOWN TO A PULP WITH MY SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE!\n- It crashed on my best computer which is the equivelant of\nan alienware. I had to use my less powerful one (which runs it\nperfectly at high settings still).\n- There are no select missions features in singleplayer (to\nmy knowledge at least). CoH had that.\n- The Menu, God, its too simple and It gave me a headache\nfrom bright colours.\n- I can't find any online games. Strange....\n- I could continue, but it'll be too rough to handle.\n\nVerdict:\nWhat Men of War Had, Company of Heroes had More, if not, TRUCKLOADS more content than this game.\nCOMPANY OF HEROES RELEASED 5 YEARS EARLIER! They should have gone: "Hmm, lets have a look at\nthe previous RTS that was sucessful and WWII based and We shall take inspiration from that!".\nWhat actually happened: "Oh, Company of Heroes was popular, LETS TAKE EVERYTHING FROM IT\nAND MAKE IT UTTER S**T!"\n\nCompany of Heroes' Menu didn't give me a headache when I ran the game. MoW did.\nCompany of Heroes' Graphics @ Highest settings beat MoW by a LONG shot.\nCompany of Heroes had skirmish. THE ONE THING THAT COULD'VE\nMADE THIS GAME BETTER WAS SKIRMISH.\nMen of War Had A cheaper price when I got it, thats it.\n\nMen of War makes me despise Most WWII RTS games now.\n\nAnd DOOON'T GET ME STARTED ABOUT COMPARING THIS GAME TO COH2.\n\nTL;DR\nThis game isn't cancer, but you'd be better investing in Company of Heroes, thats for sure.\nThis game doesn't have really many redeeming features about it other than its so called\n"Realisim" if you call it that.\n\nOverall Scores:\nCoH: 9.5\nMoW: 6.5\n\nThis game is ONLY recommended if you just want to add to your steam library.\nThis game can barely shine a light agaisnt CoH1, but can ONLY shine a light TO\nCoH2. Overall-Overall: Not Recommended if you want to actually play, only\nrecommeneded if you want to add to your vast steam library.\nInvest in any of the CoH games or Undertale. Or even garry's mod. MoW, is okay. not good or great, okay.","April 13","false","0.6"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","1"

Im not sure on Men Of War but It can be worth you're money as long as it is under $10 and you better change the settings as soon as you get it because when I started it up it was running good on windows 8 but made a small little box as the screen I had to change it to 1280 by 720 just to get a good screen but all well an alright buy better spending it on something else I would say unless like I said it is under $10 not $9.99 at least $7.00 or less.","April 9, 2014","false","5.0"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","6","19","0","0"

Since there are only 3 campaigns, I dont think it will be that long of a game, nor will it be an everlasting fun game. It was made in 2009 and it does have good aspects and good gameplay, but the game shouldnt be any where near 15 dollars since its that old and has very poor voice acting, it was literally hilarious I was laughing out loud because of how bad the voice acting was. So, to wrap this up, if you like Age of Empires or any other stradegy game on the planet, do not buy this game, you will be madly dissapointed.

Gripping shuffling-crap-back-and-forth action is, however, occasionally interrupted by other soldiers with different uniforms who show up at random and shoot at your own troops.  The only function of this feature, as far as I can tell, is to deplete your own ammunition; if one of your units dies it's either entirely shruggable or a nigh-mission-failure anyway, so it doesn't matter much.\n\nAnd ammunition micromanagement is what Men of War excels at.  It's enthralling to send a truck scurrying around the map to scrape up spare machine gun ammunition for your tank which is locked in combat with a large number of enemy soldiers who are unreasonably insistent upon its demise.  There is also tons of pixelhunting fun to be had trying to click on the thing you want to click on, with tension provided by the ever-present possibility of accidentally telling a soldier to take cover on the wrong side of a wall or do something similarly bat-guano stupid.\n\n(I'm not sure why Steam says I don't recommend this game; honestly, it's the best man-to-man cartridge-counting game around.)","October 25, 2014","false","3.1"," 12 of 35 people (34%) found this review helpful","34","12","35","0","2"

I'm not 100% sure about AS or AS2, but Men of War does not have localized servers that I have found (prior to Nov. 2014 when Gamefly offically shut down the multiplayer) which is a bit problematic given the large european audience that plays the game.

Having something like 300 hours alone on my disc-copy of Faces of War, Men of War was a great change. That said however, the franchise suffers in multiplayer. I'm not 100% sure about AS or AS2, but Men of War does not have localized servers that I have found (prior to Nov. 2014 when Gamefly offically shut down the multiplayer) which is a bit problematic given the large european audience that plays the game. Still, the single player is a good 10 hours worth, and the multiplayer (if ever picked up) is also enjoyable, provided RNGesus finds you a match relatively close by.","December 14, 2014","true","188.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They put more emphasis on depth and realism, but are also less polished. At one moment you'll be frantically defending against a massive enemy assault while armor-piercing shells ricochet from your realistically modelled tank armor, at another moment you'll assume direct control of a soldier and go on a wild machine-gun rampage.\nThis particular game features a long and challenging single-player campaign, which is highly enjoyable if you can endure the worst voice-acting in video game history (No seriously, it's that bad). If you want to play multiplayer or co-op, you're better off playing the sequel, Men of War: Assault Squad.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this if you're into WW2 strategy games.","December 13, 2013","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zirrian/recommended/7830/","zirrian","[StuG Lyfe] Zirrian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zirrian/","701 products in account","A neat little game made for folks who enjoy micromanagement, and like bit more realistic stuffs. You can group your soldiers into groups, but can direct them independently of course. Ah, and all of them have their own inventories with ammo, weapons, grenades, and so forth. So, your average Joe can hold an SMG, an LMG, a rifle, and buttloads of grenades. Okay, it might not be entirely historically accurate, but gives the game some enjoyable moments as you can pick soldiers that will be assigned to special tasks as you take direct control of them - yep, this game has direct control. Press End, and your dreams can come true. It doesn't really work when you have multiple platoons to take care of, but on missions where you have just a small group of soldiers at your disposal, it's awesome. Also, direct controlled tanks are awesome - take aim, and disable enemy tanks' turrets. Enemy soldiers will leave the vehicle, and your MGs can easily take care of them. And then...Grand Theft Wehrmacht happens. Hop in with a single soldier, drive the tank back behind your lines, repair it, put some additional bods into it, and bam, you have a fully functional tank to crush your enemies and see them driven before you. Also, it saves reinforcements - if you are lucky and have some skills, you can finish maps without losing your own tanks and using only looted enemy vehicles.\n\nAnd, it's challenging. Even on Normal you'll have some hard times, if you are not too much into micromanagement, and you aren't a really freakin hardcore strategist. But if you learn the basics, you'll have really good times with this game, and feel growing desire to get each and every one of them. Sadly it lacks proper skirmish where you get a map and battle the AI, but there are enough missions to counter this. Sadly this game was supported by GameSpy, and I'm not sure if you can get it working with Hamachi, but it's worth a try if you and your friends are looking for some WW2 carnage. Especially recommended for wargamers.","December 20, 2013","true","35.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They were not made for casuals. And this is why casuals hated them. Too buggy, too hard, uncomprehensible etc etc. Do not hear their whinning if you do not like to just faceroll a stupid AI, but instead you prefer having a challenge. I remember loading same spot like 20 times trying different things so the AI does not steam roll me. Having 3-5 soldiers and having to clear whole bases, kill/capture/disable tanks, escape etc is not something offered by many games.\n\nThis is continued in Men Of War. From 2nd mission and on, you will have to face MANY enemies more than you. I checked the end game stats and saw that I was facing like 1000 enemies in defensive missions...and you have like 50 at most. Not to mention the tanks. AI has some nice ability to kill your tanks easier that you can kill its. Yeah this can be frustrating. So, just be more careful. And save often.\n\nEven if you are a veteran of S:HOWW2, some missions can be tough. Although there is no tactics mode like in Faces of War, you can still die easily by some direct shots. I cannot say much about...replayability. Playing 1 mission for 4h +, makes you feel relieved when  you finish it. One thing that I disagree with is that you cannot do as much as you could do in S: HOWW2 when in pause. Having to command MANY squads, resupply their ammo while the AI launches attack after attack is sometimes very demanding. When you have 3-5 soldiers it is easy...no time pressure etc. But the game and its objectives are still viable, and I have screens where I lost like 10 soldiers/0 tanks in defenses. On normal. So, if you plan carefully, think, reload and try different ways to win, you will make it.\n\nAgain...it is not for casuals. If you are one, you will cry. If you like tough challenges, then you will love this difficult ♥♥♥♥♥. Graphics are nice. Enough to make take screens of the environment. Voiceovers and sound I do not care. I am muting all games so I can listen to music. Storyline. Again, I do not care much. I just like killing stuff. From what I saw it was there just to exist. Who really cares...\n\nPhysics and realism. The stuff I like: explosions, bodies launch at every direction, bullets fear the brave, they disperse, and they change direction when  they hit hard surfaces. Cannon shells...2 types: explosive, armor penetrating. Self explanatory. Now the spotting dot shows you the area of dispersion, the possibility to penetrate and ofc the distance. All this changes according to angle, vehicle armor, its speed, your speed, and other factors. It is the detail that makes the difference, and in this factor the game is a diamond.\n\n8.8/10 just because I wanted better pause tool, voiceovers and storyline that are there just to exist and sometimes AI kills your tanks too easily to make it even competitive.","April 1, 2014","true","145.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But while under your direct control Hans and his crew just might rack up enough T-34 kills for an Iron cross, the rest of the front inevitably crumbles without your attention.\n\nWhich is when you load your quicksave, turn on slow motion and start rapidly switching between Hans in his PzKpfw IV exchanging fire with a Soviet tank battalion, Kurt and his AT gun defending a crossroads, Uwe picking off the persistent infantry with his sniper rifle, Lars manning an MG42 and Otto crouching behind a corner with a magnetic mine in hand, waiting to take out the annoying KV-1 that keeps shrugging off Jürgen's PaK 36 shells like they aren't even there.\n\nThen the T-34 you were sure was dead manages to pull off one last shot that sets your engine on fire. A lucky HE shell rips your AT gun apart. Otto misses the KV by half a meter. Then everyone runs out of ammo and dies.\n\n10/10 would annihilate two German divisions using a capured Wirbelwind again.","June 21, 2015","true","41.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's an epic title. This game is the first in a now-longrunning series of real time strategy games. To start off, I must say I will NOT compare to Company of Heroes as it is great in its own right. (I won't be like all of these other fools)\n\nThe game's setting is World War II across three campaigns. The Brits in North Africa, the US in Europe, and the Soviets in well... The Soviet Union; eventually moving to Berlin, Germany. I can't really say much about the campaign as I have only played one mission of each. I'm not gonna lie; these missions are pretty hard. You can't go Call of Duty-style run-and-gun across the battlefield! YOUR MEN WILL BE SHOT TO DEATH!! It requires strategy. The same goes for multiplayer.\n\nThis game is unique as you have plenty of aspects under your command such as what the soldiers and vehicles carry. Yes, it can get a bit annoying when you have to micromanage everything. I just deal with it. Another neat thing is 'Direct Control' where you can take control of a soldier's or vehicle's main weapon. But this game is not without its cons. The game looks very dated. It looks ugly, but that doesn't affect the game itself.\n\nTo close, I recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a challenge.

There are some moments in the game where you'll feel like you're playing Company of Heroes, but then there's the MAJOR differences in-depth.\nGraphically, the game is deplorable.

Its a  fast paced RTS that makes you think on the fly. I like fact that the singleplayer is tough, I feel like a lot of games are too easy or too hard. Like any game there are downsides like its MASSIVE learning curve! The tutorial is literly keep guys in cover to avoid their deaths, throw gernades at vehicles to blow them up and select your guys. The rest you have to learn as you go. To me it was hard to pick up for the first hour but afterwards it only got better.\n\nOne thing you have to know about this game is one mistake will throw the mission for you. Sometimes that one extra soldier can make or break the firefight which can lead to a very bad sceniro where you lose  your tank, 6 men,  and left with only 2 guys to complete the mission.

They were not made for casuals. And this is why casuals hated them. Too buggy, too hard, uncomprehensible etc etc. Do not hear their whinning if you do not like to just faceroll a stupid AI, but instead you prefer having a challenge. I remember loading same spot like 20 times trying different things so the AI does not steam roll me. Having 3-5 soldiers and having to clear whole bases, kill/capture/disable tanks, escape etc is not something offered by many games.\n\nThis is continued in Men Of War. From 2nd mission and on, you will have to face MANY enemies more than you. I checked the end game stats and saw that I was facing like 1000 enemies in defensive missions...and you have like 50 at most. Not to mention the tanks. AI has some nice ability to kill your tanks easier that you can kill its. Yeah this can be frustrating. So, just be more careful. And save often.\n\nEven if you are a veteran of S:HOWW2, some missions can be tough. Although there is no tactics mode like in Faces of War, you can still die easily by some direct shots. I cannot say much about...replayability. Playing 1 mission for 4h +, makes you feel relieved when  you finish it. One thing that I disagree with is that you cannot do as much as you could do in S: HOWW2 when in pause. Having to command MANY squads, resupply their ammo while the AI launches attack after attack is sometimes very demanding. When you have 3-5 soldiers it is easy...no time pressure etc. But the game and its objectives are still viable, and I have screens where I lost like 10 soldiers/0 tanks in defenses. On normal. So, if you plan carefully, think, reload and try different ways to win, you will make it.\n\nAgain...it is not for casuals. If you are one, you will cry. If you like tough challenges, then you will love this difficult ♥♥♥♥♥. Graphics are nice. Enough to make take screens of the environment. Voiceovers and sound I do not care. I am muting all games so I can listen to music. Storyline. Again, I do not care much. I just like killing stuff. From what I saw it was there just to exist. Who really cares...\n\nPhysics and realism. The stuff I like: explosions, bodies launch at every direction, bullets fear the brave, they disperse, and they change direction when  they hit hard surfaces. Cannon shells...2 types: explosive, armor penetrating. Self explanatory. Now the spotting dot shows you the area of dispersion, the possibility to penetrate and ofc the distance. All this changes according to angle, vehicle armor, its speed, your speed, and other factors. It is the detail that makes the difference, and in this factor the game is a diamond.\n\n8.8/10 just because I wanted better pause tool, voiceovers and storyline that are there just to exist and sometimes AI kills your tanks too easily to make it even competitive.","April 1, 2014","true","145.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's an epic title. This game is the first in a now-longrunning series of real time strategy games. To start off, I must say I will NOT compare to Company of Heroes as it is great in its own right. (I won't be like all of these other fools)\n\nThe game's setting is World War II across three campaigns. The Brits in North Africa, the US in Europe, and the Soviets in well... The Soviet Union; eventually moving to Berlin, Germany. I can't really say much about the campaign as I have only played one mission of each. I'm not gonna lie; these missions are pretty hard. You can't go Call of Duty-style run-and-gun across the battlefield! YOUR MEN WILL BE SHOT TO DEATH!! It requires strategy. The same goes for multiplayer.\n\nThis game is unique as you have plenty of aspects under your command such as what the soldiers and vehicles carry. Yes, it can get a bit annoying when you have to micromanage everything. I just deal with it. Another neat thing is 'Direct Control' where you can take control of a soldier's or vehicle's main weapon. But this game is not without its cons. The game looks very dated. It looks ugly, but that doesn't affect the game itself.\n\nTo close, I recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a challenge. If you need a good strategy game to play on the side, here it is.","January 19, 2014","true","244.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Blow it up with a well placed artillery/tank shell. No? How about ramming your ♥♥♥♥ing tank into it, taking it down with any other person inside? What about shrapnels? Do you like shrapnels? I ♥♥♥♥ing love shrapnels. All explosions are not based on the laughable spherical "blast radiuses" but on flying razors that can cut your men 7 ways to sunday. If one of your unlucky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s happens to be having his head over the trench when an artillery shell hits his position or a grenade hits the top side, you better ♥♥♥♥ing hope he's wearing a helmet and ducking or else you're going to have to scoop that ♥♥♥♥ for a brain of his off the ground. Disabled an enemy tank? Oh my, well did you know that you can open its inventory, take out that machine gun and ammo, then blast the ♥♥♥♥ out of the enemy? What about the fact that you can repair it on the field and use it as your own? What about the fact that EACH tank and vehicle has REALISTIC armor, sloping armor (that actually worK), and vital spots (ammo storage, fuel storage, etc.)? You can blow off their ♥♥♥♥ing tracks, turrets, and barrels for crying out loud!\n\nThe vehicles do not operate on the basis of the Company of Heroes "health bars" but on the basis of reality. Soldiers do no damage with their rifles. Tanks get damaged based on where they hit with parts breaking down, hulls being pierced, and hulls being blown to bits.\n\nThe game puts Company of Heroes to utter devastating shame. Get it.\n\nI prefer the older ones (Men of War, Men of War: Red Tide, etc.) as ammo and infantry are scarce, you are forced to scavenge, repair, and loot dead bodies for cartridges, tank shells, fuel, and so on.

This is a drawback for some but it's rewarding succeed in this game.\n\nMinor Gliches - Nothing game breaking but it's no StarCraft 2.\n\nHere's The Good:\nDirect control - allows you to take control of a specific unit (anything from a tank to a sniper).\n\nRealistic Tank Combat system - Seriously... it's amazing. The shot penetration depends on the angle, armor thickness, round size, and distance. This makes for some awesome in game moments where you can take out multiple Panzer III with a single KV-1.\n\nOld School Inventory system - This is a downside for some but I love having to drop ammo into each soldier, loading up tanks by dragging Shells from one unit to the other. It would be nice it there was a more steamlined way of doing this but being able to salvage higher teir weapons with extra riflemen can make all the difference in a mission.\n\nDynamic Destruction - Huge explosions as well as craters and fully distructable buildings. What more do you need?\n\nMission Veriaty - From huge frontline assults to night raids, this game has something for all.\n\nDon't take my word for it, try out the demo.","December 29, 2013","true","93.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It gets the job done and its fun but there are about a hundred different ways to go at it.\n\nFor example... How to kill a guard on a smoke break -\nRun him over in a vehicle\nStab\nDisarm enemy AP mine, rearm and place it then lure he and his squad over it\nCrush with environmental debris from explosions or with the burnt out husk of a destroyed enemy vehicle that you push like a bulldozer over him.\nGuns & Grenades\nBare handed\nThrowing knife while hidden prone in tall grass\nAir Support & Artillary of several different varieties if available\n\nAnd you may be thinking... ok yeah so what?. Well, the point is that this game offers all of that OR you can zoom out until infantry are the size of ants and control a column of tanks and armored vehicles in real time... then slow down time and zoom in to the drivers seat of one of your jeeps and make the driver get out and man a machine gun nest whose previous occupant was killed AND if you really think it through you can make that driver pull his jeep up to provide soft cover from one side to protect him from being flanked.\n\nOnce defending against a wave of german armor I barely survived until reinforcements came, when they did I was allowed to call in heavy tanks and I did... when I took them to chase the germans accross a frozen river one of my largest tanks cracked the ice and fell in - then I realized I could break the ice to prevent their lighter armor from crossing.\n\nI was instructed to take a fortified position with a wave of infantry.\nI broke from the main group to comandeer a truck so I could hopefully pick up enough speed to make it over the trenches and then ram into the machine gunners sandbags with hopefully enough force to dislodge or kill him (this in itself says a lot as this isn't a canned animation or a suggested tactic, or a button - it's just something you figure out because the game apparently has a fairly robust implementation of object physics; destroyed vehicles sometimes explode and sometimes dont depending on what happened to them but if they do explode the pieces land wherever the force of the explosion takes them and then can be used as cover).\n","January 1, 2014","true","62.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not bad to where you are screaming for your money back, but it's bad enough to keep me rolling on the floor of laughter.\nThat being said, gameplay wise MOW is not bad. There are some moments in the game where you'll feel like you're playing Company of Heroes, but then there's the MAJOR differences in-depth.\nGraphically, the game is deplorable. For a title that was released in 2009, it left something to be desired of; if you get this game for the graphics, then you'll be disappointed. There's nothing, though, that a couple of mods can't fix, which MOW was gracious enough to welcome in their game.\nOverall, I'd give the game a 6/10; I have yet to try multiplayer, but based on what I've seen, the game is pretty good in some areas and lacking somewhat in others.","March 22, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or just run it over with a lightning tank manuever? Time can be slowed down, paused or sped up. Single-player campaigns are historic and fun.

It takes a bit more skill to get used to than the average strategy game, but complex physics, bullet penetration, and near-complete control over every individual unit you have should you choose it make the game very deep.\n\nSupports 16 player multiplayer, though the single player is fun as well.

Three campaigns for Russia, Germany, and America as well as a few bonus missions.\nGraphics are decent and gameplay is nice and fluent.\nHowever, due to there being no more multiplayer (unless you do a LAN party) you will only have the campaign since there are no bots to fight in multiplayer, or maybe there are and I haven't found them.

But while under your direct control Hans and his crew just might rack up enough T-34 kills for an Iron cross, the rest of the front inevitably crumbles without your attention.\n\nWhich is when you load your quicksave, turn on slow motion and start rapidly switching between Hans in his PzKpfw IV exchanging fire with a Soviet tank battalion, Kurt and his AT gun defending a crossroads, Uwe picking off the persistent infantry with his sniper rifle, Lars manning an MG42 and Otto crouching behind a corner with a magnetic mine in hand, waiting to take out the annoying KV-1 that keeps shrugging off Jürgen's PaK 36 shells like they aren't even there.\n\nThen the T-34 you were sure was dead manages to pull off one last shot that sets your engine on fire. A lucky HE shell rips your AT gun apart. Otto misses the KV by half a meter.

The only thing this game... F*** this, the voice acting in this game will make you sigh all the damn time. But that's the only bad thing bout this game really.

Horrible voice acting. Ancient graphics. It has everything of a classic RTS game.\n\nBut HOLY COMMUNIST is it difficult!! And not even because of the gameplay! No, the clunky interface and complete morons recruited to your side of the battle make the game unbeatable in itself. Think Mike Tyson Punch Out, except you can't punch. Troops don't shoot, but they'll kill each other, stop running randomly when under fire, and this is all your squad! The enemy is a cold-hard  killing machine.\n\nI played the first Russian mission a dozen times before beating it. My biggest advice is to take it slow when the game allows. Make use of the manual control (I almost exclusively use it to be honest. The AI shoots well, but only when they feel like actually shooting.) and don't even keep playing. You'll just keep getting upset.   I know the cake tastes good, but its laced with an addictive poison.\n\nI only PASS it because it is a complete game that is enjoyable for RTS fans.\n\n\n+ Destructable Environments\n+ Deep Micromanagement\n+ Good Story Telling ( - Voice Acting, though)\n\n- Clunky Interface\n- Horrible AI\n- Ridiculous Difficulty\n- No Skirmish / Custom Battles","January 13","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Horrible voice acting. Ancient graphics. It has everything of a classic RTS game.\n\nBut HOLY COMMUNIST is it difficult!! And not even because of the gameplay! No, the clunky interface and complete morons recruited to your side of the battle make the game unbeatable in itself. Think Mike Tyson Punch Out, except you can't punch. Troops don't shoot, but they'll kill each other, stop running randomly when under fire, and this is all your squad! The enemy is a cold-hard  killing machine.\n\nI played the first Russian mission a dozen times before beating it. My biggest advice is to take it slow when the game allows. Make use of the manual control (I almost exclusively use it to be honest. The AI shoots well, but only when they feel like actually shooting.) and don't even keep playing. You'll just keep getting upset.   I know the cake tastes good, but its laced with an addictive poison.\n\nI only PASS it because it is a complete game that is enjoyable for RTS fans.\n\n\n+ Destructable Environments\n+ Deep Micromanagement\n+ Good Story Telling ( - Voice Acting, though)\n\n- Clunky Interface\n- Horrible AI\n- Ridiculous Difficulty\n- No Skirmish / Custom Battles","January 13","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Saw myself playing this for maybe 20 hours or so and easily ended up spending twice that on it.\n\nThis is a game that sucks you right in if you get past the initial difficulty. Word of advice? Unlock the campaign (thanks Google) and skip the stealth missions, they're ♥♥♥♥♥ and badly scripted.\n\nAnother Eastern Bloc delight so bugs do show up a bit but they're not a show stopper. The highlight in this series is the epic scale battles and brilliant battlefield physics.\n\nAnother fine example of emergent gameplay.","May 3, 2012","true","38.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's alot of unit variation and serves its role as a WWII game well. This is very different from most RTS games, as enemies drop armour, bandages, ammo and guns, so you can command units to loot dead corpses.\n\nTanks are very powerful, like they were in WWII, seemingly unstoppable.\n\nHowever, this game is very hard, I ended up getting a refund because it was so hard. Before buying this, finish the demo version. I played on easy mode and it seemed impossible. This was also the first mission, 4th objective.\n\nIts overall very good, but really hard.","June 5","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, if you're looking for a solid single player game and don't want to bother with the rather excellent and always expanding Steam workshop for Assault Squad 2 (one of the best communities of developers out there), give the original Men of War a shot.","June 5","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
