This game definetly needs finishing and touch ups and stuff but this game has some very good potential. Nice job 314 Arts and keep the hard work up guys. I am getting a new MSI gaming laptop with very high quality hardware so when this game and all the other high graphic games I have now, I will be able to run this game at 100 FPS +. So there is something to look forward to. But 314 Arts, overall you have a very cool game here and I like it a lot already. So I will give your game a thumbs up :)","May 12","true","2.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

Its an Early Access game and it shows. However the vison behind this game is great. They are aiming to make the singleplayer like SWAT and I cannot tell you how long I've been waiting for that. It still does not have singplayer but it is only 2 days old at the time of this review the multiplayer will also become much more in depth,and what you would expect out of an FPS shooter,but with SWAT vs Terroists/criminals,and they've already have had 2 bug fixes. I would recommend to support these commited developers with there vision. :)","April 30","true","1.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

I do not speak for everybody regarding this game.\n\nThis game looked fun to me when I watched the trailer, however, when I played the game I was a bit shocked.\n\nWARNING, THE GAME IS EARLY ACCESS SO PLEASE DO FURTHER RESEARCH IN ORDER TO MAKE YOUR DESCISION. THIS REVIEW MIGHT BE OUTDATED AT THE TIME YOU'RE CONSIDERING BUYING THE GAME.\n\nPros:\nNice graphics\nCool Customization\nDecent weapons selection\nNice variety of maps for an early access game\nMenu is simple\nOptics are all nice\n\nCons:\nThe lag on some maps (when close to fire)\nThe game doesn't have much of a playing community\nHigh price for so little content.\nNo singleplayer modes (firing range)\n\nWhat would I change?\nI'd better optimize the game (I know you are working on this)\nAdd more maps\nMore guns\nMore servers (especially in Asia)\nWork on the sounds a bit.\nFix some lighting issues on some maps - The shadow of the smoke is solid on the heli crash map (for example)\nAdd a jump feature. Please...It's hard not having the ability to jump when it is pretty much a standard in modern games.\nAdd something awesome to the game! The mention of parkour in the key bindings could be taken to a next level. Add a parkour mode of sorts in which you press a button and you go into Ezio/Altair style parkour on the maps! (this would be awesome with the FPS aspects.\n\nNow, I cannot recommend the game at this point in time as it is not full enough to be a multiplayer game (there is no community), however, if you and a couple of friends (1-10) bought the game, then I can imagine it being a very very fun game.\n\nKeep working on the game and I'm sure it'll grow and I'll get it again, however, for now I must request a refund. (sorry devs)\n\nAnyways, that's just my opinion. Buy the game and form your own though! You may disagree with everything I said in this review!\n\n","May 3","false","0.2"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"
