Flash forward several years "Star Control 2" was released, Bigger, Brighter, higher resolution, and a fully fledged campaign that had one of the best stories - ever.\n\nI bought "500 Years, Act 1" because it looked eerily similar to such a classic franchise (and I like collecting games) and to some extant it did bring give me a certain feeling of nostalgia, the artwork certainly has the '80's / '90's retro look, the gameplay / story is basic yet interesting(ish), as were the sound effects.\n\nDid this game live up my StarCon (1 & 2) inspired hopes, no, not really, no.\nIn fact definitely not.\n\nUnfortunately  the story, which is kind of intersting, is far too short. And then just like my previous sentence, it just ends with the promise of a continued story in the form of DLC to come. Much like the games of the '80's (and even some modern ones) there is no real decision making in upgrades, nothing to spend your non existant monies on you simly get to upgrade your energy levels and place power in systems to improve them - a simple system that works, but is nothing exceptional.\n\nIt would be great if the dev's could rub some funk of this game and include resources / money and a larger playing field, in fact there is a lot that *could* be put into this game which would add to the experience .\n\nIf you have read down to here (congratulations) you might be thinking I would give this game a terrible review, oddly enough the opposite is true, for all its shortfalls it was an enjoyable game with some good potential, and maybe, just maybe, with some support (and sales) that potential might just be realised.\n\n\nP.S.   As this game stands I have no idea how Valve has put a ~$8 price tag on it, buy it on special $2 - $3 is chump change and almost certainly worth it to try to entice the dev's to add more content.","July 14, 2015","true","3.0"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","0"

The BGM would have driven me over the edge if the game had been any longer. The sound effects are bad. The story is bad, and old, and so is the game concept, which looks inspired by EGA Trek[archive.org], which, all things considered, is still the better game. The controls are extra bad: you need to move and rotate, and you do that with either mouse button, which makes good kiting all but impossible; and it only looks right when the ship is center screen, which it often isn't, but the game will still act as if it were. I also tried Xbox controller twin stick controls, couldn't get the hang of them: the ship still seemed to behave erratically. (I wonder what the mobile version controls are: tilt and point?) On every space journey there's what seems a 90% chance of having exactly *one* random encounter, except these get old fast, and you don't profit in any way from the fights: no loot, no XP in any of the game.\n\nThe best part is that there's a load-out phase where you can change your ship configuration and trade points for speed, handling, shields, and weapon damage and range, so that when you misjudge, you can try another load-out which may work better on the present enemy encounter - except that from mid-game on, fast engines and long-range missiles pretty much dominate anything again and again and again and again and again, because it's the same few fights over and over, mostly. Mysteriously, the HUD lacks range indicators and cool-down indicators, and you can only fire on the one selected target and only when it is within your firing arc, even when you're using homing missiles -- on the long-range missiles and medium-range beams, this means weaving from side to side, wondering if you missed the heading or if the weapon hasn't cooled down yet. On top of that, damage is random, i.e. a big proportion of hits don't actually do any damage. Miss a missile hit two or three times in a row, and their shield is back up. Oh, and if you're unlucky, your ship spawns outside the screen, and if you're very unlucky you can't fly it back in and have to close the game externally because you can't leave fights.\n\nI've played free flash games that did this better. This game is a slog, not fun.","July 17, 2015","false","4.2"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","1"

The gameplay is repetitive. Now going more into detail. Just a bit.\n\nYou are some lad who just got his new rusty super old spaceship and you travel from your human colony in search for help because you are lacking resources. It seems that there is a super high chance of having a battle during every single trip between stars. And exactly one of them. It gets frustrating and it gets so fast.\n\nThe combat is horrible. You only attack the target you've selected and switching targets is somewhat of a pain. Oh and turning is the worst thing ever here. You got to face your enemy to shoot them. That's lame. Somewhat understandable, but majorly not.\n\nLil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eg35LVQDck","September 19, 2015","false","3.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Why is this?  I suspect it is people involved with the game went through and voted down any negative review.  So please keep that in mind when reading through the negative reviews for this game.  It's not as though these reviews are fundamentally worse than the few positive reviews, it is more the case where a few people can skew the favorability of reviews they don't like.\n\nThis game definitely reminds me of Star Control II.  Is it as good?  Uh, no.  Is it worth $8.  Uh, again no.  Is it worth $1.  Uh, maybe, if you are bored, and want to play a game very reminicent of a classic, though don't get your hopes too high.\n\nUnlike the original, the combat feels very clunky.  It sort of has the same rules, where you fire in the direction you are facing.  However, in this game, unlike the original, you can only fire if the enemy you are targetting is in front of you.  This can be a pain, when you have several enemies zooming around you, and the one in front of you isn't the one you targeting.  You can target the closest ship, but by the time you do, it may be too late to get in a shot.\n\nEnemy ships tend to like to zip around you and avoid getting in front of you, while hitting you from behind.   At least in the first few battles I played, you spend most of your time just trying to evade them (unti your shields regnerate) and then trying to properly face them and get in a shot, if you are using nuclear weapons the default weapon.  The mini gun actually works better since you can get in lots of little shots that end up doing more damage overall given how few nukes you really get a chance to fire.\n\nIn the first battle I won, it wasn't because I actually hit the ships much, it was because the first enemies, the Llaxons have a 2% chance of their ships blowing up when firing.   I end up having to fight them not once, but three times in a row, since each time you talk with them, you have to repeat the battle.  The game doesn't seem to remember you killing them, nor do the Llaxons themselves seem to remember meeting you, since it is always the same conversation.\n\nAs for non-combat side of things, you are basically led through a story.  All the choices were made for me, which is not how Star Control II worked, where you could make choices that had consequences.  This game lacks strategic depth and seems to be a first effort in making a game.   The game does have a few good points.  The descriptions are colorful, and the story as it is, is cute for the time it lasts.\n\nSo final verdict.  Only get this game if it's part of a bundle, or on sale, where you pay a $1 at most.  I'm not sure it's really worth even that.  Overall, while the game has a few good elements in terms of story to the point it goes, the other factors, such as the clunky combat, really detract from being able to really enjoy this game.","July 22, 2015","false","0.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

This is a good game. Harkens back to the days of Starcon.... True space exploriation and interaction with an interesting back story.  I actually hope to get to play the second act someday.

It's clunky, it looks funny, and it even smells weird (really!), but there has obviously been a lot of effort and time put into it by a very small team, and having had a hand in game development my self, I know how hard that can be. But I don't just recommend it out of pity, and because Steam's "mostly negative" rating must be a kick in the guts for the developer. No, I did enjoy playing 500 Years Act 1, and I hope an Act 2 comes out eventually.\n\nThe game is basically a poor man's Star Control, with a galaxy map upon which you can travel, 'zooming' in to a small-scale plan view of local space for battles.\n\nYour ship is upgradeable, and you can change the upgrades you have in effect before each battle, which is a great feature. The battles themselves are a bit clunky, and if you experiment with the upgrades you'll quickly find that some battles simply can't be beaten with some upgrade combinations.\n\nThe story is interesting, if mostly a bit bland and derivative, and there are a few ideas that I though were really creative. A few grammar errors did distract me at times, but it's certainly no worse than many other indie games' stories on Steam, and I found it interesting enough to complete the game to see what happens.\n\nIt will take a certain sort of person to enjoy this game as much as I did, and honestly, it's retail price of $7.99 is simply too much for what you get. The game can be completed in a couple of hours; the rest of my play time has been achievement hunting.\n\nBut if you can find it in a bundle or on deep discount, you enjoy small-scale space operas and can cope with a clunky combat interface, you should get a couple of hours of moderate enjoyment out of the game.\n\nHere's hoping Act 2 is still on the cards.","October 12, 2015","true","4.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Alas, the combat prevents me from shifting the balance the way I wanted.\n\nDue to my lack of imagination, I have to say that the game plays like a cheap Mass Effect based solely in menus and in combat sequences that offer a pittance (if that) of fun, gratuity of rage.\n\n\nUsing a controller, the ship is very hard to maneuver. You literally rotate the right stick to shift your direction - there's no moving it diagonally to shift in that direction quickly. This would be fine, if there was any sort of stability to it. I'd assume that with the way the right stick works, the left stick would be purely up or down (a-/decelerate, as it were). No, the left stick also rotates your ship when trying to move in a certain direction. So your two thumbs are fighting more fiercely than the enemies do you... kind of.\n\nThe combat is the reason for my not recommending it; the game might actually have been better if there was no combat (or if it'd been totally reworked)(had to learn from another (better) review that this was apparently on mobile). There's no point to the combat other than for it to be (which would be fine, if it was even just acceptable). No XP, no loot, no consequences for failing. Get a Loadout screen before each encounter; comes down to getting the right setup and the right amount of fortune to pass the combat. To have to do it again after a few minutes of being in menus (what I'd call "the actual game," trying to keep from outright condemning 500 Years as a whole).\n\nThe story thus far - though hardly original - could have me engaged (were it not for the combat)... though, actually, probably only because of my high regard for Planetship (and maybe Charlie's image (a la Aeon Flux) and Clarence's bio).\n\n\nI can't recommend this game, though I will continue to try and reckon it myself.","July 23, 2015","false","2.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
