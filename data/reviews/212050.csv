Puzzles are fresh and rather challenging in some cases, while 8 bit style graphics are really cool! The story conclusion should have been less rushed out, and the sound department is a bit poor, nevertheless I really liked this little gem.

But, if you're already a fan of classic 80s and early 90s adventure games you'll probably have a great time.\n\nAnd if you know what SCUMM is, you'll likely love it. : P\n\n","January 1, 2014","true","4.8"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","27","28","0","0"

This game is a challenge. A REAL challenge. First the brave and challenging stuff. This game is very very brave in my opinion. There are game mechanics that I have never seen before in a point-and-click. Long Term Memory (LTM) and Short Term Memory (STM) play a big role in this game. Not only do you have inventory items to talk about and give, but you can draw on your memory to piece puzzles together and solve the mystery. This was a very interesting idea, since it makes you really pay attention to every detail, and you have to pay attention to EVERYTHING. Plus, it makes you think about things that happened in the very beginning, especially at the end. Another strength is the idea of four protagonists. At the most I have only ever played with two protagonists. It's easy to keep track of their storylines and when working together, it isn't difficult to see how they should be used. Resonance is bold in making you play four different characters. Not only do you get to manage four different storylines (that is the easy part) but you have to maintain four different inventories, LTM's, and STM's. Thats where is can get kind of tricky, especially when you are expected to use all four protagonists at once. Certain characters can only go certain places and do certain puzzles. I went to a walkthrough a little more than I wished to, mainly because I wasn't patient enough to really sit down and figure it out. Don't get me wrong though, the puzzles can be difficult. This is the best looking Wadjet Eye game I think to date. It still has that wonderful retro pixel look,  but it is very smooth. The characters are all great and their storylines are easy to keep track of. Great voice acting all around. There is more than one way to solve puzzles and there is more than one ending, making in necessary to at least play through twice. This was a challenging game I am glad to have completed. I look forward to playing this again someday.","January 28, 2015","true","13.5"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","21","23","3","3"

Puzzles are logical, intuitive, and require critical thinking and paying attention to your context and options, not relying on trial and error like a surprisingly large amount of classics do.\n\nIf you like other games from Wadjet Eye Games like Primordia, the Blackwell series, Gemini Rue, or another, I can almost assure you that you will like Resonance. The opposite is also true, WEG is a great developer/publisher and has a pretty good library of p&c adventures.","November 12, 2014","true","15.1"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","2"

I am going to have to check out some of Wadjet Eye's other games now.\n\nThis game is an old school style adventure game but with some new innovations that make it feel more fresh. Theres a Short Term / Long Term Memory system, four controllable characters, a unique conversation system, and lots of brilliant and unique puzzles, some of them with a hard scientific edge. The savegame system has steam cloud support, and there are steam trading cards and an extensive list of achievements, anda  commentary mode that add some replayablity.\n\nNow for the bad, the game was a little buggy, I came across a dialog glitch where everthing sped up and dialog was skipped through several times, and characters got stuck a few times, but nothing game breaking. The overall sound felt dated, as did the graphics, but I think it was deliberate as they were going for that old school feel. The soundtrack was actually pretty decent though. There are no graphics options, you can only run the game in a window, but it still plays decently despite this.\n\nOverall, the story felt modern and captivating. The game was challenging, but the story was intriguing enough I was compelled to keep plugging away. Will be playing through again to try and get 100% completion and some of the achievements I missed, I ended up 5 points away from 100% on my first playthrough!\n\nPick this up at full price or on sale, either way you won't be dissapointed.","October 23, 2015","true","13.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","11","11","3","0"

Rarely did I find myself clicking random objects until I found the answer. The puzzles are not always easy but they tend to rely on common sense, real world knowledge and paying attention to the story. The long term and short term memory mechanic is genius, and the characters are all rounded and well written. Speaking of the characters, at some points in the game you control multiple characters in the same area, and while the controls for that are a little unweildy at times it does work very well and adds another layer to the puzzles. This sci-fi adventure is in places witty, intelligent and sometimes a bit disturbing - Anna's nightmares come to mind, and I'd recommend it to anyone, not just point and click or sci-fi  fans.","March 23, 2014","true","3.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I like to play them from time to time, but there's a great chance the game will have puzzles that just don't make any sense to me, or that the story just isn't compelling (enough).\n\nResonance features a bit of my first problem with the genre, and practically none of the second. The story managed to keep me interested the whole way through. Despite the retro graphics (which I love and respect !) the voice acting is top notch. And there were a few levels that were also truly tense. Something I would never expect to see in an adventure game, let alone a game with 16 bit graphics.\n\nI have to be honest and say that I did use a walkthrough a couple of times (aye, I'm only human). But then again; I'd rather continue the story than be stuck doing -at times - frustrating puzzles.\nSo, Resonance pleasantly surprised me. I hope it will do the same for you guys.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","July 26, 2012","true","7.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's smart and has good puzzles and keeps fresh by moving between four intriguing characters and a number of explorable locations. However, about a third of the way in, at the moment when you are given the ability to switch between the four at will - when you can access their interchangeable inventories, use their short-term memories on virtually everything to recall things as conversation items, as well as calling on their respective long-term memories, and the ability to go to a slew of new locations, things get a bit overwhelming. This was where a friend and I called it quits. I eventually came back and followed a good community guide. This overwhelming bit actually doesn't last too long and then you return to a fairly linear but still quite open playstyle - totally manageable and more like other adventure games. It's got a great story that really picks up from that point on and the dynamic between the four works really well when the world is made more manageable. You might enjoy the complexity of the bit I found overwhelming but if not, and you too begin to play this great game and find yourself disheartened at the four-character exploration bit, just read that bit of a guide and then press on on your own again - it's worth it!","January 4, 2014","true","26.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

This put a cool twist to how adventure games usually works and forced you to think more outside the box to progress the story.\n\nThe story itself was very interesting and well thought out. You could choose between four main characters at any time which reminded me of Day of The Tentacle. They all had their strengths and weaknesses, so you had to make them work together to complete the puzzles and progress.\n\nThe Puzzles was really good and didn't feel forced or illogical.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stambo/recommended/212050/","stambo","stambo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stambo/","1618 products in account","Resonance is an adventure game with a retro feel, but also modern influences.\n\nThe first thing that sticks out is the pixel art style the game adopted. I am no fan of the pixel art style, I think it is overdone and also done badly most of the time. In this game however the art style is reasonably well made. The animations are quite smooth, the characters are distinctive enough so that you can see their expressions and glean their personality from them. And the backgrounds in the game are clear and not too busy, this makes sure that you won't be spending a lot of time pixel hunting for that one item you still need like in most adventure games.\n\nIn the game you can control up to 4 characters. At the very start you control only one and you choose in which order you would like to play the beginning of the story of each of the characters, then the game starts opening up and gives you control of more characters. Controling multiple characters at the same time was actually quite interesting and created some nice interactions which aren't really seen that often in adventure games, especially not in the classic ones. However controlling mulitple characters can also become tedious as you have to manually control everything they do, you can order the other characters to follow you, but even doing that is tedious and not really all that helpful in the end. Controlling all 4 characters at the same time for a puzzle towards the end where you have to use all 4 is downright annoying and thankfully the game limits the number of characters you can control at the same time soon afterwards. Overall the multiple characters control feels like it was tacked on despite it being an integral part of the game.\n\nThe story and the dialogue is where an adventure game is supposed to shine, and Resonance does just that. An interesting story and characters keep the game above water at all times. The game never becomes too dull to play, although I do have to mention that the last third of the game is definetly the weakest and potentially even disappointing, as the game is trying to wrap up the plot points. However most players will probably have already figured out the important parts of the story and will know how it's going to concluded, so it feels like you are just going through the motions at the end.\n\nResonance is definitely worth playing if you like adventure games or you enjoy a good story. However I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else, it's not exceptional enough to bring over people to the genre.\n\n7 / 10","October 24, 2014","true","8.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The story here is very solid, the main characters are pretty interesting, the graphics and sound design are all pretty good, and some of the puzzles are pretty interesting and unique.\n\nI think the issues I have come down to the world itself being rather bland; the most out-there concept of the entire universe is the titular resonance itself, which for all I know could be real (probably not, but ehh.)\n\nAs well, the game's flow is... well, it grinds to the halt for a section in the middle that feels reeeeally adventure game-y and the plot mostly comes to a halt for this section, too. As well, you have too many options and some of the puzzle solutions are obscure enough, plus the annoyance of having to constantly change characters, drag specific things into memory, give items to other characters because only certain characters can do certain things... it piles up into a rather unfun segment of the game that I pretty much gave up on and resorted to a walkthrough for, which I otherwise didn't use for the majority of the game.\n\nOther than that though it's enjoyable enough. The dream sequences are pretty unique and engaging, the timed puzzles are generally not too obscure as to require trial and error, and the game's length is pretty fine for the genre. It wasn't the most engaging or most memorable but it's a pretty enjoyable ride most of the way through with a pretty noticeable bump in the middle.","October 14, 2015","true","14.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Game ran without bugs or glitches, has a very functional UI and control scheme.\n\nGame mechanics wise, there's a lot of good to say.  There are no pixel hunts and with a bit of intuition you can solve almost every puzzle without a guide.  The game uses an inventory system where you can assign events and objects in your environment to use in dialogue, including saved mini-cutscenes so you aren't left wondering 'What was that plot point again??' if you forget or come back to the game after a long time.  A lot of possible memory-objects are just red-herrings but for the most part it works well enough and doesn't lead to backtracking to have to commit the right object to memory.  You have a split control scheme for the four characters in the game and while it thankfully doesn't complicate the game it also doesn't add to much, although if you think of the point as letting there be multiple important story characters then it works just fine.  You can 'game over' but the game rewinds you automatically to before the fail point and you wont run into any arbitrary King's Quest 5-esque deaths.\n\nStorywise the game throws a few fairly good twists at you.  The environs aren't very interesting aesthetically but do the job just fine.  The voice acting is robust, much more so than Primordia, and the two games share most of their main voice actors.  The four main characters are believably normal and have some genuinely touching, repulsing, and amusing moments.  There aren't really any strong side characters, and the 'villains' aren't really a strong element of the story as much as the interaction between the four.  Of the three Wadjet Eye games I have played thus far (Gemini Rue, Primordia, and this) I would still reccomend Primordia more if just for the more interesting if less robust premise, but all in all it was an enjoyable title.","February 10, 2014","true","7.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I can legitimately say I was surprised by this one; the story tends to be somewhat corny in some cases, but the lines felt natural and the plot kept me playing til the end. The voice-acting was pretty superb (featuring the triumphant return of Logan Cunningham from Bastion) and each character felt developed if a bit spotty in some places. There are a few non-intuitive puzzles (then again it IS an adventure game), but none of them will make you want to headbutt the keyboard.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tomxj/recommended/212050/","tomxj","Tomxj","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tomxj/","807 products in account","Overall i thought Reasonance was trying the limits of the ags engine though. Controlling four charaters was clunky, and i did find the sections where you only had two characters to interact with flowed alot better. Saying that the narative definately benifited from a party of four, and after the 'jump' (so to speak) it got really, really good! With the ending being handled extremely well with no pretentions of a sequel. A complete, rounded story arc.\n\nAnother thing I found a bit hit and miss were the more tactile puzzles where you had to move the mouse cursor around a maze, or slide pieces into a puzzle, some were great and others were just frustrating (Cut the rope puzzle i'm looking at you).\n\nSo would I recommend Reasonance? Yes. But not to someone new to ags adventure games, there are plenty of games I'd recommend first, such as Gemini Rue or perhaps Blackwell deception. But if you can get over its slightly clunky controls there's a brilliant piece of interactive fiction in Reasonance, with some real gut punching twists and turns.","April 27, 2013","true","14.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Too bad, the menu's gone now, and you've got to listen to a crappy canned response *again*.

As far as I'm concerned, GUI's in adventure games go, Hero's Quest 1, probably the best text parser, you could put ask about the big tree under the hill, and then the Quest for Glory 2 Vga remake that was recently made by AGD or formerly Tierra Entertainment, they had an awesome combination of KQ5 icons with a text parser when you talk to people.  And this GUI with its long term and short term interfaces, is seriously the best GUI I have ever seen.  I thought icons ruined adventure games because you could just click everywhere and every item on each other and everywhere on the screen to figure out puzzles, instead of logically deducing them.  This GUI brings back the fun of the text parser, with the simplicity of icons, so awesome.  And then on top of all that, the story and actual game is AWESOME!

The story is really intriguing and the characters are well written. The game has some original gameplay mechanics (long & short term memory) for puzzle solving. So you wont constantly face the standard "here's a list of dialog options, hammer at em till you pick the right one" situations. You're actually required to do some logical thinking. Also you're not forced to be completely linear. In the "act 2" of the game you get the freedom of choosing in which order and (to some extent) how you complete your tasks. And hey, 2 different endings. You'll come across with some optional puzzles too, that'll flesh out the game world and explains the stories of the characters better for you, which I found awesome.\n\nGreat adventure game about science and  conspiracy with heaps of good plot twists.","January 5, 2015","true","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure, at first the pixellated graphics make you say "oh wow, this is like Monkey Island all over again" but by the time you're halfway in, Monkey Island is gone from your mind. The story is dramatic, occasionally funny, and keeps you on your toes. Interactive moments don't simply plug a tired puzzle formula into the mix every once in a while, but succeed in immersing you further into the world. As the climax is reached, things accelerate so that by the end, you feel drained - but that doesn't diminish your sense of accomplishment. Plus, there are some branching decisions - replay value!

The charaters are also very well done, leaving you wanting to find out more about them & hearing more about what they have to say.\n\nA lot of the puzzle solving elements in this game really don't hold your hand.

It's one of my favorite games in my library.\n\nIts one con is like most in this genre--it lacks a lot of replayability fun.","December 5, 2015","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is very good and does a good job of engrossing you in the world. The charaters are also very well done, leaving you wanting to find out more about them & hearing more about what they have to say.\n\nA lot of the puzzle solving elements in this game really don't hold your hand. Assuming you don't use a walkthrough, they may take a while to solve if you haven't picked up the appropriate item along the way.... so you may end up having to re-visit earlier locations to find something that you previously missed.\n\nThe graphics, although I'm assuming they were meant to look like a really old  retro point n' click game, do take a bit of getting used to though.\n\nThoroughly enjoyed this one.

Interactive moments don't simply plug a tired puzzle formula into the mix every once in a while, but succeed in immersing you further into the world.

The character animations are good, each character has their own set of expressions. Some animations like walking around are jumpy like old 16 bit games. The biggest negative to this game is the graphics resolution, about the same as an old fashioned Sierra title from the early 90's.

On the familiar front, you've got multiple characters and an intuitive character switch panel. Dialog boxes are nothing new, and the player inventory is pretty common. What they've added are two inventory-like panels to the UI for long term memory (LTM) and short-term memory (STM).\n\nBoth panels can be used similarly to the classic inventory. As events occur, a recap becomes available in certain character's LTM. By interacting with that directly, you can reply the event and remind yourself where you left off or what your current goals are. Or, you can drag the memory to a character (or into a conversation) to ask/mention that event. The short-term memory allows you to drag any object with a label into the STM panel where it becomes a similar memory that you can use to ask NPCs about.\n\nThere are several puzzles designed into the game that require you to make use of these features, and they do it in clever ways that make these additions feel very natural. Your first "aha" moment solving one of those brings an extra buzz because of the way they integrate these new mechanics.\n\nThe puzzle design is top notch and the story is quite compelling. Cast in the style of a 16-bit techno thriller, there's very little to its execution that you could accuse of descending into cheesy. It stays on top of the ball and its plot twists are well executed without a lot of TV-style telegraphing what's going to happen.\n\nIf you're a fan of the adventure genre, you need to play this game.","December 3, 2013","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is fast paced and engaging. The puzzles were challenging and logical. The music and voice acting were good. There were some new and interesting game mechanics. The first is the short-term and long-term memory system. Second is switching between the four main characters in order to solve puzzles. The character animations are good, each character has their own set of expressions. Some animations like walking around are jumpy like old 16 bit games. The biggest negative to this game is the graphics resolution, about the same as an old fashioned Sierra title from the early 90's. Since some of the puzzles and game mechanics rely on visual cues, this detracts from the overall playing experience. What is most impressive about this game is that it provides a good experience in spite of this primitive graphics resolution.","January 12, 2014","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Their older adventure games go through a learning curve in puzzle design and UI but sticking through it is always worth it for the story. This game is no exception. I'm only 1.8 hours in and already entranced and sucked in. Even to people who normally dislike the adventure game mechanic, I highly recommend picking up a walkthrough and going through it just to experience the tale. (Not to say that their puzzles aren't fun. I think they're fun but it's not for everyone.)\n","June 17, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just one situation, though, and maybe it was me ignoring something obvious.\n\n\nAnyways, this game is very worth buying & playing - especially when bought in Sale!","June 20, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, it's a mix of both ideas actually. And it works well. The game is structured as a series of rather localized puzzles (specially at the beginning!) so it is easier to focus. Well balanced, interesting and fair (I almost didn't cheat at all, and I have so little patience!)
