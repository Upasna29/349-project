Let me start by saying this is a game that would get a solid 8/10 if the developers had spent just a few more days polishing this off.  Want to scroll around the map with the mouse? Too bad. Like a useful tutorial? Nien. Want to connect two metro lines together? ♥♥♥♥♥ you. Made a mistake about 50k$ ago designing that highway? No Undo. Time to load that save from a million years ago. When Chris Saywer made the ambrosia that is RollerCoaster Tycoon, he understood that you wanted to design a path - AND THEN pay for it. This was figured out in 1999 guys. Scenario goals not working? Let's check google; oh hey some people had the same problem six months ago. No patch, just more shít DLC. Here is the secret to winning for those interested: take out a huge loan and build one really good metro right at the start. Now leave your game on overnight and you can come back and have fun when you have actual cashflow. Cities in Motion 2 is a great sandbox game ruined by seemingly arbitrary design decisions at Paradox Interactive. 5/10 for a nice-looking game that doesn't deliver.","March 17, 2014","false","49.3"," 292 of 344 people (85%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","85","292","344","15","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nexussays/recommended/225420/","nexussays","nexus says","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nexussays/","421 products in account","This game is a huge disappointment. An unenjoyable experience that is more akin to literally working at your city's transit authority than playing a game which simulates it. If you are interested in this concept, play Cities in Motion 1 instead, for all its flaws, Cities in Motion 1is a far superior and more enjoyable game.\n\nI love Cities in Motion 1 and was excitedly looking forward to the sequel but it fails in every respect. Instead of taking the existing, functioning, and very fun CiM1 and improving upon it, it feels like the developers started from complete scratch. Spreadsheets and boring route planning are the name of the game ("game") in CiM2.\n\nHere are some examples of ways this game is worse than its predecessor, increasing from the nitpicky to the game-destroying:\n\n1. The graphics are much worse, both in quality and art direction\nCiM2 looks like the textbook definition of "generic." The colors are drab, the buildings are uninteresting, and all the cities look and feel identical.\n\n2. The UI is cluttered and incredibly confusing\nThis could have been an excellent area of improvement over CiM1 but instead the UI is just a complete mess. Dialog boxes litter the screen. Important information is buried or not shown. Icons convey little to no information and are reused over and over again providing no distinction between, for example, different buses.\n\n3. Instead of adding depth, they added layers of required and uninteresting micromanagement\nFor example, in CiM1 one aspect that I felt was severely lacking was the ability to space out vehicles on a route or provide an actual schedule for their arrival. If you had a long bus line, when you started it every bus would start from the same station; leading to an inefficient route where all your buses arrive at a stop back-to-back and then passengers wait for eternity until they all come around again.\n\nIt would have been so easy to simply fix this issue by automatically distributing them evenly and providing a timetable scheduling as a more advanced option. Instead, CiM2 provides the most convoluted scheduling interface imaginable.\n\n4. You are required to build depots to support each of your transit routes\nThere is nothing wrong with this in concept, but in practice they take up such a huge footprint that the cities hardly look like they could support any residents. What city on earth has bus/tram/etc depots seemingly every other block?!\n\n5. Most of the provided cities DON'T ACTUALLY NEED PUBLIC TRANSIT\nThis was the killer for me. I loaded up one of the biggest cities the game offers, excited to tackle its transit problems. I switched to the heatmap to see areas of congestion, and literally, without exaggeration, there were absolutely no traffic problems in this entire huge city aside from a single highway off-ramp.\n\nSo instead of needlessly building out a myriad of complex public transit options, I just demolished the onramp and replaced it with a larger multi-lane one with a left-hand-turn lane. Speed up game-time and after a couple months the problem went away.\n\nSo... transit problems solved. That was fun.\n\nIf this were real-life I suppose I could use my copious free-time as City Transit Manager to perhaps play some computer games. Since CiM2 supposedly is a game I'm left wondering WTF the point of playing it is.","July 18, 2014","false","1.7"," 254 of 305 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","254","305","9","11"

But once you know, it works:\n\nYou have to delete and rebuild roads to get bus lanes. Trams can have tracks on medians and pedestrian paths, and you have to build the tram station appropriately (in the median or on the side of the road). Metros can be built elevated or underground with the page up/page down key (minimum clearance is 8m, which is two page ups/page downs). Building metro track at elevation zero (0 m) will enable your cursor to snap to metro track stubs. Building a metro track/road curve is like using the pen tool in photoshop: you drop a vertex with left click and you undo the last vertex with right click. Waterbuses cannot navigate through/around terrain, so you have to manually waypoint around those. The metro passenger entry point is that tiny "teleportation box" that appears on the nearest roadway when you build the station. Tram tracks/Trolley Wires need to be connected through intersections by clicking on the tracks/wires on one side, then clicking on the side you want to connect to. If there's no routable path to the next station, zoom in and inspect the roads for one-way streets and missing intersections. When you delete intersecting roads/metro tracks, the remaining road can still have remnants of an "intersection" that makes it count as two roads. That "intersection" can be deleted again to turn the road back into a single piece of road/track.\n\nIf you do play multiplayer, PAUSE THE GAME OR SLOW IT DOWN BEFORE DEMOLISHING ANYTHING, and try not to demolish a lot of things in rapid succession. Don't play it on the fastest speed. If you do desync, have one person share their save file with everyone else and overwrite their local saves, then try to rehost the game.\n\nYou can adjust the rulesets to do things like make the game speed slower (helpful for big, lagtacular maps) and increase depot size (recommended).\n\nHopefully reading this makes the game playable, since it's pretty fun once you know all the little things. But then again, I was determined to make it work.","September 23, 2015","true","98.0"," 76 of 80 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","76","80","5","1"

As much as I love sims and management games, there are too many half-baked ideas and over-simplified systems.\n\n- Zoning is a nice idea, but the brush to set zones is massive and impossible to use with any real precision.  The handful of pixels that make up stations, is easily smothered by the massive zoning tool.  And precision can be the difference between a perfectly priced line and a total failure.\n\n- Ticket pricing is extremely finicky.  Doing absolutely nothing but letting the simulation run can see costs fluctuate from $1 a ticket, up to $30, and back down to $1.  All over the course of the week, and with no discernable pattern(rush-hours, night time, mid-day, weekend, doesn't matter).  There is no real control, or even logic, to the numbers that are your life-blood.\n\n-Side missions should be a good source of additional income to speed up gameplay, but instead lead the player astray and are not helpful at all.  The paths/objectives requested are not lucrative at all and the small rewards do not make up for the costs of the projects requested.  Holding onto "population increase" and "vehicle purchase" missions can be helpful, but are passive in nature and can be very time consuming.  The point of the game is to build and manage, and to do so well.  Why do side missions work to hinder the core mechanic of the game?\n\n- While the game environment will make way for, and adjust to, whatever roads/rail systems you put in place, the control of routing lines, vehicles, and population can be incredibly difficult.  Often it is easier to rebuild the existing road system instead of using what exists.  But even then, the resulting design or plan the player has can be difficult to implement with the cumbersome and demanding pathing/planning system.\n\nThe game has a lot of good ideas and systems that just aren't fully fleshed out, realized, or functional.  And what you do get is not very well explained, defined, or even remotely consistent.  I did better taking out a massive loan, building two huge subway lines, then letting the game run for hours on end in the background.  Trying to build interconnected systems similar to real world cities only lead to spectacular failures and wasted time.","July 16, 2014","false","19.3"," 90 of 108 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","90","108","2","5"

But: The game is very limited in its options and gets boring and repetitive very soon. Also lots of sync-bugs prevent you from playing the multiplayer properly. I really enjoyed the coop mode, but you always only have a very limited time to play before the game totally craps you up.\n\nWARNING: If you play this game in multiplayer over a longer period of time, you'll always get out of sync without any chance to get back. Your coop-partner may build lines but you don't see them and also other important data (like the time of the day, your money, your company value and your weekly income) is totally off for you and your partner. Saving and loading the game again does NOT help to fix this! (Edit: Turns out you can manually end the game, let the host send you the savefile and then load it again to enjoy another few minutes of synced multiplayer gaming until it gets out of sync again. It's still very annoying though, you kinda have to spend half your playing time to manually keep the game synced...)\n\nDo I recommend this game? If this was a beta version: Totally yes! Unfortunatelly the options and variety of this game are very limited and it's totally bugged (at least the multiplayer) and there is very little chance that there are any updates still being made to this game, so it's not really worth its price.\n\nAll in all: Great concept, great ideas, bad implementation.\nStay away from this game and eventually hope for a sequel to make a better implementation of this great game concept.","December 15, 2013","false","59.5"," 147 of 198 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","147","198","0","0"

Unfortunately, there are enough little quirks that made it difficult enough for me to play that I have to give it the thumbs down.\n\nI didn't want to... I WANTED to build cool bus and trolley routes, but half the time my depots just wouldn't connect to the street they were right next to no matter how much I zoomed in and shifted roads around.  I would like to say that building ferries made my city magically accessible, but it was dang hard to find a place where a pier would actually fit, much less a ferry depot, whatever that was called, and the silly ferry drivers couldn't manage to find their own way around a peninusla without a few straight line waypoints.  People digging tunnels for the metro, on the other hand, were somewhat troubled by both straight lines and curves that were too tight... also, it's not clear to me how you can have underground metro stations but a metro line that can't cross under streets.  Or was it just some streets?\n\nI dislike writing negative reviews -- I'd give this a middling score if there were options between yes and no -- but I think this game could be made much better with some simple tweaks -- if I want to bulldoze a station, it's OK if I scrap a few vehicles in the mix; or just pop up a window asking me to sell or move them.  Recommend some nice paths for overlapping lines that actually work, or give some tutorials that explain when and how a trolley line and a metro line can cross, because I really just couldn't figure out why some of my intersections were disallowed.\n\nOh well.","March 9, 2015","false","1.9"," 82 of 107 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","82","107","5","0"

The game is not a city builder in the traditional sense--you can build roads and expand your cities around them, but that isn't the primary focus of the game. That being said, there are some pretty serious challenges to the game, and the mechanics as well. I do have several concerns with the game in general, but I'll get to those in a bit.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\nThe good:\n-Seriously challenges you to be efficient\n-Engine is good\n-Large variety of possibilites, you can make your own city, workshop is available too\n-Variety of transportation methods\n-Building engine is easy to use and cool\n\n\nBad:\n-Game is DLC-Based\n-Stops are unrealistic---vehicles leave without being full when people are obviously running to the stop.\n-Cars are stupid: they do not take advantage of multiple lanes going to the same place.\n-Height of buildings are not realistic (It maxes out at about 35 stories).\n-When building new roads, game is prone to developing tons and tons of elementary and high schools, forcing the player to demolish them so houses can be  built.\n-People are stupid: all vehicles yield to them--ALWAYS.\n-Traffic lights make no sense\n-No easy way to make central hubs.\n-No control over individual lanes in roads.\n-No right turn on red.\n-No arrows.\n\n\nAll you really need to get money in a game is one good Metro line, then you can just hit fast forward for tons of money.\nI like the game, but it gets boring and repetitive very quickly. Even with all of the DLC, it's really easy to just fall into the same rut over and over again. The game does a good job for those of us who enjoy city management, however that aspect of the game is fairly half-baked and automated. The content leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nI do not reccommend the game to any of my friends.","October 12, 2014","false","131.4"," 85 of 116 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","85","116","8","1"

But as much as I want to love this game, I simply cannot, because its controls and mechanics are infuriating and extremely frustrating.\nIt is so damn annoying to do anything in this game. After an hour I was convinced that the game is deliberately doing everything the way I don't want it to, from camera movement to adding bus stops to setting schedules to building these damn metro tracks from hell that never go the way you want them to. It's amazing how counter-intuitive the controls are.\n\nIt is extremely hard to see the roads. Underground view is not really underground view, it's ground view + metro tracks, which makes both roads AND metro tracks impossible to see. Finding your bus stops is even worse, since their tiny transparent icons blend nicely into the background. Conclusion: You can't see anything. It all blends together.\n\nBuilding metro tracks in this game is just the worst thing ever. They never remember or understand the elevation you chose. They don't want to connect to each other. If they do, they do it wrongly. Connecting a track to an underground depot is impossible, since the depot track is under the depot, rendering it invisible, so when you try to connect it, the track decides it now has to surface. After 10 minutes of this farce, I closed the game, promising myself to never play this again.\n\nAnd this could be fixed by a patch. Only that it won't be, because the developers are adding new cosmetic DLC instead of actually fixing the broken game.\n\nI'd love to play and like this game, but I can't, because every time I do, it leaves me frustrated and angry at it.","August 28, 2014","false","1.6"," 83 of 115 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","83","115","4","0"

However, turns out it was quite simple. Just click on the trolley line that is already built, & then click on the road ahead that you want to continue building the line.\n\nI also had a tough time passing the first Campaign as they wanted 15% coverage, and even with my extensive coverage, i still was around 50% of that 15%. After many hours, I figured that building lines should be 2-Way(I built 1-way), which means that the line must go back and forth to the same stop area(just like a regular public transport train).\n\nThis game's tutorial could be improved too. I know that the developers are currently unlikely to change it right now, but the tutorial is very 'Wordy', which to many new players may not seem interesting.

It's surprising how much you can zoom and watch the little details in the city. Amazing ideas in this game but the execution is very poor in some areas.\n\nThe average speed of a bus is 1.7km/h (in game hours). That means that timetables are practically useless since your night buses will get back to the depot at 3pm since some 9km lines will take 15 hours to finish. I don't understand what the developers were thinking. Is this supposed to be a simulator or not? Why would anyone use a bus that needs 4 hours to take him from his house to his work? What's the purpose of "rush hour" when buses take 1 hour to reach the first stop and then spend another 3 hours picking up people in the morning that want to go to work. I don't know, time in this game makes NO sense at all. It's an insane oversight that simply ruins the game.\n\nIf you use the custom rules you can set the time to run at 3%-4% of the normal rate which brings it to a real time simulation with buses driving around the city as they would in real life, taking the proper amount of time to reach places, and timetables become again useful. But that way, when you run out of money good luck waiting 5+ hours on your computer (with the high speed setting ON in-game) for an in-game week or so to pass so that you can buy a few more kilometers of metro rail.

Also worth setting different lines from a same depot to leave with a delay (e.g. fist buses leaving each line at 4:30,4:35,4:40 respectively, for instance) to avoid queuing, jams, etc on the roads nerby. Don't forget to buy enough vehicles for every depot, for servicing. Don't buy too many either because they won't fit in and just deteriorate over time, waiting on the streets.\n\nStreet types:: Building roads is incredible, you can curve the range of different types (avenues, one-way streets-bus lanes, and a large combination of these) at any angle and arc, more diversely than in Cities:Skylines.\n\nVehicle parameters: Acceleration, capacity, maintenance cost, fuel consumption, attractiveness.\nYou can choose to invest in attractive vehicles early on to increase usage. You can choose smaller capacity vehicles running more frequently, or big ones running paced out.\n\nFinances: You can set driver/reparimen/inspector wages (and nr. of inspectors). The sweet spot for inspectors tends to be 11 credit wages, and an amount so that they catch ~33% of freeloaders. This yields maximum income. The income from inspection nicely balances the loan payment amount usually\n\nCons:Loans: This is almost like cheat. will have almost unlimited money: You take a huge loan, and set a long nr of installments. It means you can build an infrastructure of metros straight away and guarantee decent income while never actually repaying it (as it may take ~50 in-game weeks or more). Have the decency to work with the 100k starting money, and also don't burn it on metros or trams. Start with buses and replace them later with trams/metros.\n\nCampaign: The game jumps you into "Berlin", a huge city with a lot of tasks to do. It should start with a small village. Also the campaign scenarios are short, and not really diverse. Custom, free, Steam workshop user-created maps are great to try but offer no missions. Still it's fun to play this game as sandbox, like Cities: Skylines is also, basically.\n\nPerformance: On larger maps or a large nr. of lines the game likes quite a bit. It is actually caused by the overlay (floating icons for vehicles, stops, lines, depots) which can be turned off but cumbersom (individually).\nAlso it is heavily CPU based, so even an 8-core AMD 8350 struggles on 3x speed (you don't play on 1x usually). When the CPU can't handle more, 3x feels like 1,5x. Not necessarily FPS drop but simulation speed is sluggish.\n\nVehicles: While there is a nice selection of vehicles, there is one ultimate one in each category, meaning I never actually tried most of the buses/trams as they are inferior.\n\nGameplay: While I put some 100+ hours into the game (therefore safe to say it is addictive) it is a grind sometimes. Also can't seem to change the default schedule to something better (2 hour frequency is really bad).\n\nAI: The citizens very rarely glitch into circling some vehicle at a crosswalk when too many of them want to cross the road.\n\nRoad upgrade: Unfortunately, as good and diverse the road types are, you cannot upgrade them, but need to demolish and rebuild.\n\nTicket prices: The game allows you to set ticket prices for vehicle type vs zones, and for single ticket and passes. While this is great to be flexible, it also becomes a grind. Basically a huge table of 6*5*2 cells that you continually need to monitor and update because as you build new lines, demand changes and hence the prices (really complicated system, you will see. The game gives you hints whether a price is below or above the normal. Per cell. With an alert at notification bar every time there is a single cell (ticket combination) that deviates moderately. Ouch.)\n\nStop interest: The circle area of a stop that you place (which attracts only the buildings inside) is a little disappointing. A better solution would be the method in Train Fever where citizens will decide how much they need to walk, and they still choose a stop even if it's far, if it means they still get from A to B faster (that game starts from horse carriages are though).\n\n\nOverall I greatly recommend the game, with its flaws there is still a ton of plus, and is a fantastic simulation for anyone loving traffic, public transportation, or just plain management games!

For starters, you don’t start in the past and progress through the ages – everything is fixed in the modern era. City maps are also much, much larger, and give a more varied and interesting landscape for you to work around. Cities also evolve dynamically now, instead of via a set progression path – players can plonk down their own roads and access-ways, and houses will spring up around them. The City AI will also react to where you start plonking down transport lines as well, so there’s a very to-and-fro dynamic going on. There are also a lot of minor tweaks, most notably in the management of your company and the lines themselves. Such a departure is not without its consequences though – what Cities in Motions 2 gains in more long-term, large scale gameplay, they lose in short-term, focused gameplay. When presented with your first, large city, it can be quite hard to know where to start.The campaign is largely forgettable, offering up a number of generic, unimaginative missions that you will also get during the sandbox game. In the latter, at least, you can decide to forgo a mission when it bores you, during the campaign you cannot.Much of its appeal lies in its commitment to the day-to-day workings of contemporary fictional cities over Cities in Motion's 100-year timelines for mostly unalterable maps of Berlin, Helsinki, Vienna, and Amsterdam – particularly in the way traffic patterns correspond to a day-and-night cycle and the way you can expect bursty rush hours on Monday mornings and Friday evenings.These additions provide a richer and more realistics experience that extends far beyond mere cosmetics.Yet the new commitment to realism also means that the pacing might seem unbearably slow, even with accelerated time.Cities in Motion 2's more realistic approach may leave it looking a little drabber than its predecessor, but its focus on dynamic cities, timetables, and ticket prices in a contemporary city in real time make it a significant improvement over its predecessor.","December 7, 2014","true","71.4"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","28","36","0","2"

The graphics are well done, the timetable system is decent and the fact that you can build extra "bus-only" roads is very interesting. However, the online mode needs some work; you can't see the others' view in Coop, so there's no way of telling what someone is talking about. Also, the passengers and the traffic are not sync'ed, so where one player sees a huge traffic jam, the other might see an empty street.

You are doing this by building trams, buses, metros and boats. This is in difference to games like Railroad Tycoon, Transport Tycoon and most recently Train Fever where you transport people and goods between cities.\n\nThe base premise of the game works well with a well executed economy and people having regular destinations and are able to use several different lines to get to those destinations.\n\nThe game offers a pretty limited set of trams, metro trains, buses and boats. As far as I can make out if you want more you have to buy DLC:s.\n\nThe game has a campaign that is reasonable and also acts as a tutorial. It is not very special though.\n\nAlthough it is possible to build a profitable tram network, if you want to make as much money as possible, it is almost always best to borrow money to build a couple of metro lines, which will make you enough money to build more metro lines. This makes the game a little bit more boring since not all options are viable.\n\nThe ingame time is something pretty confusing, since all lines take strange amount of time. It is easy to build 12 hour lines even in quite small city. And passengers are often quite happy to go to work in lines that take several hours. It leaves the impression that people in these cities are spending all of their time transporting themselves.\n","November 1, 2014","true","37.2"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","22","30","0","0"

For that price I would maybe recomend it, but definetly buy it if it goes on sale as it has in the past.\n\nI got about 30 hours out of it and maybe will get more. I'll start with con's since there are so few:\n\n-Campaign is pretty simple in terms of building/planning: Just build a central metro/tram and then build buses/trolleys to feed into it. You'll always make a profit, and by the time you can, you are able to get 100% coverage on the campaigns.\n-Not able to see all the routes people use who live/work in a build. You have to click on each person (opens a new window), then click on where they commute to (opens up a new window) and then on that window you have to click the scroll to button that moves your camera to that building, and then you have to close all the windows to see anything. Repeat these steps for each person. It really sucks the planning out of the game as you are just throwing down lines wherever you think people need them without any data to go on other than "buildings are here".\n\nPro's:\n-Great graphics\n-Entertaining game if you like managing the public transit system and tweaking the schedule of different lines and solving the bottle necks that occur with things like having a busy metro interchange with a busstop.\n\n\nOverall recomend to play and explore, but it's lack of dept prevents playing it for much more than 30 hours unless you are really into this genre.

Have played the base game with none of the expansions.\n\nImpressions: This is such a hard game to give a fair review too.. and it's not that it's a bad game... it just has a  frustrating element to seemingly balance out every good one.\n\nThe biggest issues are with the tutorial poorly describes the two systems it covers and does very little to prepare you for the deep-end when it finishes. To really play with any degree of success it's essential to watch some tutorials videos online and read some fan sites to get information on just how the transport systems work.\n\nThere's so much game play and it's fun to build thriving economies but so frustrating when you cant see why your city is failing or when one poor choice has you scurrying back to the last save you made till you save before placing every single building.\n\nThe Good:\n*Decent graphics and sound, not amazing but more than adequate.\n*Nice touches like seeing individual people travelling around the network.\n*A range of transport options that are nicely animated.\n*Pre-order bonuses are now free in the inbuilt store.\n*Intelligently connecting lines gives satisfying results.\n*Growing a city really feels like you are making a difference.\n*Creating routes requires some thought and the campaign makes you think more as you progress.\n*Campaign is really fun, if disjointed, as you town hop back-n-fore.\n\nThe Bad:\n*Steep learning curve and terribly inadequate tutorial.\n*Graphics and sound don't wow you but aren't irritating either.\n*Despite a range of transport several systems feel too much alike.\n*Campaign missions are repetitive, boring and lack vital info.\n*Ticket pricing and wages are lacking depth.\n*Despite dozens of information windows some feedback just isn't available.\n*Setting timetables is a chore, even with the copy function.\n*Building/Stop upgrading is initially confusing.\n*Very limited modding options, which could have been really fun.\n\nRecommended for:\nCity builders and god game people. Certainly for teenagers as there's little to wow a younger audience.\n\nConclusion.\n7/10.

Fortunately the game allows you to cancel these misisons\tasks without penalising you and shortly afterwards a new mission will appear. The rewards given vs the the costs of creating a route is also quite a bit out. The missions\tasks also do seem a bit repetitive and uninspiring.\n\nI feel the DLC is a bit overpriced and a bit of a cash cow, where some of it should be included with the game.\n\nAlthough given its downsides the graphics are good, although you are more likely to keep zoomed out in a overhead view most the time as this is easier to place stops, the game is unique but I would still play the original cities in motion before trying this one.","August 28, 2014","true","5.3"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","20","29","3","1"

It definitely took me a lot longer to get into.\n\nCons:\n- Steep learning curve. You'll probably fail a few games before you get the hang of identifying profitable routes.\n- The default game mechanics make it ultimately almost impossible to fully serve a densely populated city. If you expand too quickly you'll start losing reputation *very* quickly as your vehicles get stuck in traffic jams and your stops fill up with unhappy passengers. Buses and trolleys are difficult to use for mass transit; you'll find yourself forced to use trams a lot, or else build your own bus-only roads.\n- More demanding on hardware even on the lowest settings. I had a fairly decent older computer before this one and the game would overheat the cpu on a regular basis.\n- Less user friendly in some respects. There's no confirmation before construction or most demolition. Constructed depots and roads take up more space than you would expect and it's easy to cut into the space mapped for city buildings without realizing it, which will cause them to pop out of existence immediately. Save before any renovation projects.\n- Some of the randomized tasks are either worded very unclearly or programmed in a buggy way. A lot of the connections need to go both ways; unfortunately, Some won't be recognized even if you do that and I can't figure out what's going on.\n\nPros:\n- CiM 1 was locked to a two-dimensional grid with some canned elevation differences. This game is 100% freeform 3D, with actual hills and valleys and streets curving all over the place. It feels natural, realistic, and alive.\n- Higher level of transport simulation. With all your vehicles coming from and returning to depots it feels a lot more realistic.\n- Individual and monthly ticket pricing, transit zones, etc. lets you control rider customer experience to an unparallelled degree. Vehicles can return to the same stop multiple times in a route or even loop back around the same route if you so choose. The freedom is yours to design exactly the transit system you want.\n- The financial system is easier to track. Loans are simple to understand and repay; the game quickly informs you if your tickets are far too expensive or cheap in real time; there are graphs for every possible purpose you might want to look at. You can tailor your strategy to the situation seamlessly.\n- The ability to build your own roads and tramways is *not* to be underestimated. You're not limited by the routes the scenario designer thought you might need. You can bypass high-traffic areas entirely by building a detour.\n- Campaigns with a more free-form structure than the original. You can very much choose your own path to success.\n- Game mechanics can be adjusted freely, tailoring the experience to what you want.  But it only works for sandbox and custom games, not the built-in campaigns.\n- That same feeling of almost zen-like relaxation you can get from the first game is definitely present here.\n\nConclusion: More to wrap your head around than the first game. This one definitely demands more from your mind and your hardware, but it does start to pay dividends eventually. What you'll find here is a very enticing game which offers the freedom to design the transit system you want to run. It's probably not for everyone, but it can definitely be a very enjoyable experience.","May 31","true","35.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It's fun, addictive, and kills time rather nicely.\n\nHowever, let's start off with the first and most glaring flaw of the game: Lack of a proper tutorial. There is a tutorial, but it's very basic and fails to explain anything beyond your first basic bus route on roads that already exist, leaving the rest of the game's mechanics a complete mystery.\n\nSecond is the gameplay itself. It just feels clunky and unintuitive. When you design a system, you need to get it right the first time, or you'll be ****ed and have to scrap it and do it all over again. There is also zero capability to change said system once it's already in place.\n\nThird is the UI. It's clunky, unintuitive, all over the place, and you have no idea what any of the buttons actually DO. That is, until you accidentally replace that one apartment building with a train station.\n\nAnd finally, there isn't really much to DO, other than "don't go bankrupt". In similar games like OpenTTD (Transport Tycoon), even if you don't have an AI, you still feel like you're accomplishing something. You start off with a few cities and industries which are in desperate need of connections between each other. But in this game, you essentially start off in a city without any problems whatsoever. Everyone seems to be getting around rather happily, without any congestion of any sorts. Sure, the town is missing public transit, but it seems to be of little concern to its citizens.\n\nYou can expand your cities by building roads, but in the majority of the cases, there isn't any room for any more roads. Every spot is already taken up by other roads, or water.\n\nInstead of fixing the numerous bugs and issues this clearly unfinished and unpolished game has, the developers instead opt to release more DLC. The game could've been so much better if the developers had spent a few weeks polishing the game.\n\nIf you're a fan of games like this, consider buying it during a sale. 20 euros is way too much to justify buying this.","August 14, 2014","false","1.7"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","11","16","2","1"

Not in-game crashed which would probably be cool. But actually crashes of the game, it freezes and you have to force quit Steam altogether. If this happened once in a while it would be ok, but this happens at least 4 to 5 times a day. My Mac's specs are high and updated and I have the graphic rendering lower than normal.

Even with Cities: Skylines now out, this game focuses more on the public transportation aspect of a city, and from what I've experienced in real life, these mechanics seem quite realistic. For someone who is really interested in a simulation/engineering game genre, this game really hits the spot. The game's experience is great, and the openness of the single player quests really encourages you to achieve them your own way in your city.

Do you want a game where the point is to ship people from point A to B and back? Do you want a unmoddable, unexpandable(as of now 12/1/13, there are no known expansions other than the monorail.), and generally generic game?\n\nWell, here you go, a city transport game in full 3D with a handful of vehicles to haul people and NO goods or other transport-worthy stuff. However since this game is a people transport game I suppose I can ignore that fact. However I cannot ignore the fact that after you plop the stations and watch the buses go... there is nothing else to do... I have played OTTD (Open Transport Tycoon Deluxe) and I can be on it for hours, mainly due to the fact you have TRAINS. In CiM2 I play with some metros which oversimplify the game generally. Also, you'd have to pay at least $5 more to get a decent amount of trains or verierity, since the regular game has just 2.\n\nThis puts me into the main problem of the game, the game lacks a worthwhile amount of content. You get about 11 vehicles in total (14 or so if you preordered like me) and probably 150 props and buildings. Thats it. The devs are working to cram more vehicles, but only if you pay $5 for 5 vehicles. It is unknown if the devs want to make a building pack as well.\n\nSomething I can give it credit is its road system, it has a really  flexible road system which includes from roads, expressways, and one way roads\n\nGraphics:\nOdd, the graphics/color sceme might not be for everyone, I had mod it in order to suit my tastes. Modeling and texturing are fair but not world-class.\n\n6/10\n\nContent:\nAs I said before, there isn't much beyond the 150 buildings and props, and the handful of 11 vehicles in the regular version, the DLC adds some  20 more but the cost of that alone can buy the game probably twice.\n\n4/10\n\nGameplay:\nGameplay is well, like it is, you place a line from point A to B, and hope to make as many stops as possible to make more money. It generally thereafter is just making sure you have sufficient vehicles and depots to store them. Making grids with the roads is a hazzard, since the roads don't snap with each other in order to make crossings, thus resulting in you making grids road by road until you have a grid. After all is done and said, there is pretty much nothing else to do.\n\n5/10\n\n\nRating:\n\n5/10\n\n\nMy Final Opinion:\n\nDon't buy this at full price, or better yet, buy CiM1, you'd have more fun than this dead end game. Maybe if you wait a year or two maybe the game gets better. Right now, its not worth the $20 (+ $27 DLC).","December 1, 2013","false","32.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/allosautos/recommended/225420/","allosautos","allos autos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/allosautos/","115 products in account","Cities in Motion 2 (CM2) is published by Paradox, so that should tell you three things: first, it has a steep learning curve; second, it has a horrific UI and mind-boggling design decisions; and third, it will take something mundane and make it addictive. CM2 really has a problem with the second of these. For example, the victory conditions of the campaign maps are "Have x% coverage". Unfortunately for the player, "coverage" means nothing like the English word "coverage," and its precise meaning is never explained. This makes the game artificially difficult. Despite these gripes, the game still is entertaining.\n\nWhile entertaining, and definitely worth the $5 I paid for it, I can't bring myself to recommend this game. This is due in part to the designer's attitude towards DLC ($5 for more busses?) and how its patches focus on niche markets (Mac-only issues, Linux compatibility) despite persistent and well-documented bugs that affect everyone.\n\nTL;DR: Engaging and entertaining, yet buggy, has awful UI, and is worse than an EA game for DLC.","January 7, 2014","false","15.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

At the same time, there are many things that stop this game from being as great as it could have been.  As you can see I've put many hours into it, so I thought it deserved a review.  This review is designed for people who are already sold on the concept of running a virtual transit agency and are more interested in an opinion how it's been executed in this game.\n\nIn my opinion, here are the pro's and con's of CIM 2 compared to CIM 1.\n\nPROS:\n1)Way bigger cities than CIM 1.  One map can provide many hours of gameplay.\n\n2)Easy to make maps that are true to real life cities with the "maps4cim" fan tool.  Recreating a real city is a huge endeavor but some really brilliant maps have been created with it.\n\n3)Although the timetables are more fiddly than I'd like them to be, they're still an improvement over CIM 1.  Instead of messing with the timetables I just set the same service frequency 24/7.  For example, once an hour.  In CIM 1, it was much more painful to make sure your vehicles stay spaced out, and I would avoid modifying my lines as long as possible to avoid the pain of dispatching my vehicles evenly.\n\n4)No lag even on large cities.  In CIM1, performance bogs down with a medium to large network, which is much smaller than the largest networks you can build with no problems in CIM2.\n\n5)You can expand the city yourself if you find you're flush with cash and need a new project.\n\nCONS:\n1)Can't color code metro lines!  In CIM 1, the Line statistics Plus mod allows you to individually color lines which is awesome for metros.  Anyone with an unusual attraction to metro systems knows that one of the most interesting things about a metro system is analyzing how all the colored lines meet up for transfers on the map.\n\n2)Ticket pricing is annoying and adds no value to the gameplay experience.  There are 5 transit types, 6 with monorails, and each transit type has 7 types of tickets.  So you have to fiddle with up to 42 different ticket prices on a regular basis.  What cims consider a reasonable fare for each ticket changes frequently.\n\n3)The art direction in CIM2 is much lower quality than in CIM1.  The CIM2 home and loading screens are ugly and use garish colors while the screens in CIM1 are very pleasing and interesting.  Buildings and colors are nicer looking in CIM 1.  The music in CIM 2 is not as good; I turned the music off and instead downloaded the SimCity 2013 soundtrack to listen to while playing.  The UI for CIM1 is much easier to use, and CIM2 text is often difficult to read.  Only the vehicles in CIM2 get proper artistic love.\n\n4)The more complex your network gets, the weirder your cims choose their paths.  I get around this by avoiding double\nservice in areas beyond connecting points and using the ruleset editor to make sure all vehicles have 100% passenger attractiveness.\n\n5)Random crashes and no autosave.  I've had a few instances where I played for 5 hours straight and forget to ever save, then the game crashes.  Then I ragequit and don't play for several weeks.\n\n\nNEUTRAL:\n1)Metro lines are easier to place than CIM 1 once you get the hang of it.  You can make bendy tracks and underground stations don't take up any space above ground.  In CIM 1 an above ground building may need to be destroyed to build a station entrance.  The tradeoff here is that train stations are less visually pleasing than they were in CIM 1.  Instead of watching passengers take the stairs down to the platforms, they get in a magical teleporter from the steet to the platform.\n\n2)expanding on the above, the ease of placement is almost too easy in CIM2.  There's no challenge at all in building metro lines since you have variable height placement and the street grid above has no impact on placement.  In CIM1, you're limited to only 3 levels of track at intersections as well as the restrictions of the buildings and streets above ground.  CIM2 placement is very easy and CIM1 is challenging, though frustrating at times.  I think the best way to solve this would be to add geology/geography as a bigger placement factor.  For example, make it more expensive to tunnel through bedrock than softer soil, and more expensive to tunnel under buildings than under roads or empty space.  Also, make above ground tracks cheaper than underground so there's an incentive to choose wisely between the two.  This is certainly out of scope for CIM 2 but one can dream for CIM 3 :)\n\nIN SUMMARY:\nIf you're more interested in an arcade-style game that's visually pleasing, go with CIM 1.  If you're looking for a game with greater simulation depth, more network flexibility, and you're not terribly turned off by bad art, choose CIM 2.  Both games are great in their own right.  I wouldn't recommend either game to anyone, and which game is better depends on the individual's preferences more than one game being any "better" than the other.  If you think you'll probably like both games, play CIM1 till you get bored, then play CIM2.","August 3, 2014","true","187.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

My trams were taking forever, and the tram customers were terribly unhappy, all because I had to route it the long way around a few intersections that were inexplicably blocked from tram tracks for no apparent reason.\n\nAnother time, after I'd finally managed to sort out the bus route and the tram route, I tried to create a metro. I tried placing train tracks over a road, thinking it would make an overpass, or at the very least tell me I couldn't do that - instead, it simply demolished my road, stopping my tram and bus routes in the process.

Honestly, I tried demo version some time ago, but... well, it was a demo, and it lacks a lot of things. So I was not satisfied and banned the game. But then one of my mates from school told me, that this game has actually pretty deep and sofisticated level of simulation, and boy, he convinced me to buy :) And I am GLAD that i bought this one !\n\nMy mate was totallt right - this game has madning simulation abstraction ! Everything int the city is an object and everything is in computers memory - I mean really, can you believe that ? Now I am playing in a city with 60 thounsand people, an ALL of them all there ! Even theyr cars are there, everything is alive ! You can track one person and watch his every move in the city ! It is amazing ! And not to mention building actual travel lines. There are buses, troleybuses, trams, subeays and omnibuses, which are something like a bus on the water.\n\nThere is not much what I can take as a bad thing in game. Souns are 8/10, soundtrack is 8.5/10 - very fitting and adictive, but quite repetiting, so you mayne will end up with turning it off and playing your onw music instead, althougt I must say that combo of soft techno and soft electro is very fitting and I enjoy it a lot - the core simulation 10/10, putting lines 10/10, well... ok, maybe not for subway. I just CAN NOT figure out how to place subway lines ! Honestly, this is a nightmare for me, and I hope I will figure it out, because my city is crying for these :-)\n\nWell as a result, I will give it 9.5/10, and that 0.5 point down is for subway :-) But it is my fault I guess. Mechanics are smooth, simulation works great, and game can even solve some sorts of glitches that may appear, or when I suddenly delete a station with busses already there :-D I testet it a lot and I am trully satisfied. This game will entertain me for months.","June 21, 2014","true","39.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

But once you know, it works:\n\nYou have to delete and rebuild roads to get bus lanes. Trams can have tracks on medians and pedestrian paths, and you have to build the tram station appropriately (in the median or on the side of the road). Metros can be built elevated or underground with the page up/page down key (minimum clearance is 8m, which is two page ups/page downs). Building metro track at elevation zero (0 m) will enable your cursor to snap to metro track stubs. Building a metro track/road curve is like using the pen tool in photoshop: you drop a vertex with left click and you undo the last vertex with right click. Waterbuses cannot navigate through/around terrain, so you have to manually waypoint around those. The metro passenger entry point is that tiny "teleportation box" that appears on the nearest roadway when you build the station. Tram tracks/Trolley Wires need to be connected through intersections by clicking on the tracks/wires on one side, then clicking on the side you want to connect to. If there's no routable path to the next station, zoom in and inspect the roads for one-way streets and missing intersections. When you delete intersecting roads/metro tracks, the remaining road can still have remnants of an "intersection" that makes it count as two roads. That "intersection" can be deleted again to turn the road back into a single piece of road/track.\n\nIf you do play multiplayer, PAUSE THE GAME OR SLOW IT DOWN BEFORE DEMOLISHING ANYTHING, and try not to demolish a lot of things in rapid succession. Don't play it on the fastest speed. If you do desync, have one person share their save file with everyone else and overwrite their local saves, then try to rehost the game.\n\nYou can adjust the rulesets to do things like make the game speed slower (helpful for big, lagtacular maps) and increase depot size (recommended).\n\nHopefully reading this makes the game playable, since it's pretty fun once you know all the little things. But then again, I was determined to make it work.","June 5, 2014","true","129.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Of course, that's probably my fault since I couldn't find the fun in CIM 1 either and stupidly bought CIM 2. Shame on me.\n\nI'm not going to waste time describing the game as there are plenty of places to find that out. My impressions are that the game is dry, the feedback is lacking and that the pre-established cities make it more of a pain because you're stuck within the limitations of what someone else has already created. Finally, there's no progression. So what does all that mean?\n\n1. Dry - You'll get the occasional mission from someone to connect A to B, but in my (albeit limited) time with the game nothing else seems to happen. The world is supposed to change, but it doesn't happen very quickly. There don't seem to be any disasters or major situations the player should respond to. For instance, it might be fun if the city council designated an area as an economic recovery zone and required you to help with mass transit to that area. Or a new theme park opens and you can take advantage of that. That doesn't seem to happen. I don't get any sense of creativity or accomplishment in CiM2.\n\n2. Lacking Feedback - Probably my biggest beef. I have no idea why some routes make money and some don't. I can't get the feedback I need to make decisions. How profitable is a line? Not sure where to find that. Maybe it's in there, maybe it's not but it's not intuitive at the very least. Where's the highest demand? Where's the lowest demand? How much do some people like certain vehicles (I think this is in the manual, but doesn't spell out exactly the percentages which make a huge difference). So I feel like I'm building aimlessly and that's fatal in a business simulator.\n\n3. Cities Pre-Established - I hate this. The first campaign takes you into a massive city. Changing roads or doing anything substantial to the road system is impossible due to the cost. So I'm "band-aiding" the transportation system and not creating. There isn't even a sandbox map that's wide open. I feel confined. Again, no creativity makes Jack a Dull Boy.\n\n4. No Progression - At least CIM 1 had different eras. It had a horrible interface too, which is why I didn't play it much. But you saw your town progress and you got new vehicles as the years went by. In this game, you're in the modern era so there's no progression. It really takes away from the game. Same vehicles, same cities, same approaches. Yawn.\n\nIn short, I can't find the fun. The game seems like it might be a deep simulation, but with all the factors above I'm bored out of my mind shortly after loading it up. Thanks but I actually require entertainment as part of my gaming pleasures. Skip it.","December 27, 2014","false","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Colossal Order is a great company yet small. They are very flexible and open and this game has more potential then it is now it could with some more publicity and minor improvements could get some people from the city builder market as well. This game would not replace Simcity or Cities XL but add another fun game to the libary for those people and aid them in their city building games. I play SImcity and my city runs so smothly thanks to some ideas from CIM2. Great game buy it. Ignore some of the not reccommended people out there they likely wanted it to be like CIM 1.

It definitely is true to purpose. It's a satisfying mass-traffic, public transport simulator and management game. I legitimately feel like I should be in an office building wearing a suit while I play this game, which, if you're interested, is probably exactly the kind of thing you're in to.\n\nIt has a map editor. It has a rule set editor. Both of these allow you to customize the game surprisingly effectively. I, personally, went through the effort of looking at Google Maps images and remaking my home city and then proceeded to play that map with my friends.\n\nRoad building is easy once you get the hang of it. Alternations of click and right-click allow you to customise the shape of your tracks and roads effectively. There is a lot of information available, so there is a bit of getting-used-to time required in order to navigate things correctly, from, for instance, lines to depots to buying vehicles. Timetables are important and there's a lot of micromanaging of vehicles and time required to ensure optimised routes and service. I would recommend starting with a standardised timetable (say, one vehicle every hour) to get the hang of it.\n\nYou need to connect to direct IP to get multiplayer to work reliably. Using a VPN such as Hamachi is a good idea for this.\n\nAll of the game's issues can be described as annoyances, which is an improvement on game-breaking issues, which many games have these days.\nTo cut to the chase, the game has the following issues:\n- Multiplayer desyncs eventually, meaning eventually you and your friends will have different city economies, income, won't see certain things the others do, etc. You can fix this by manually getting them to replace their save file with yours, which can be tedious. It can take a satisfactory amount of time before this desync happens though, so multiplayer is still functional on a short-medium term basis.\n- Many additional vehicles are DLC. It's money grubbing, and it does have some effect on the game, but you don't need the DLC to enjoy the game to the fullest extent unless your enjoyment comes primarily from seeing differently coloured buses and trains. You can modify the game's rules to make your vanilla vehicles have the same or similar functionality to DLC vehicles. No particular loss, just annoying.\n- Changing ticket prices can be tedious, but there is a mod to help combat this (available through steam workshop).\n\nIf you are reading reviews on this game, you must be interested in some sort of a city management game. This is a public transport management game. It has some city management elements, in that the city's growth is directly affected by the success of your public transport system, but it is mostly a business management game, the business being specifically a public transport system.\n\nI recommend it, you should try it, if you wanted to manage the busses and trains in a SimCity 4-esc city, whilst the city manages itself, and it is very good at doing that.","January 21, 2014","true","43.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

This game is definitely worth $20. It has it's flaws but when compared to Sim City it really does shine in a way that forgives it of it's problems.\n\n=== The GOOD ===\n- Real traffic, real pedestrians, and their AI actually calculate's their travel all over the map. You don't have to wait in an area to see the traffic and pedestrians build up. You can zoom into a neighborhood and immediately see all the traffic. The city feels extremely lively. The masses feel real.\n- Beautiful game.\n- HUGE cities.\n- Lots of detail.\n- Great frame rate.\n- Satisfying.\n- Extremely unbalanced. But that's ok because you can use the "Rule Editor" in the Tools menu to change the capacity of all the vehicles, change the break down times, change how fast they are fixed in the repair shops, how many residents the city has, EVERYTHING. So you can re-balance your game however you like.\n- I increased the city population density by 500% and it was awesome! You need to have an extremely good PC because the game calculates each and every person's commute. I increased the capacity of trams to 200 people per tram (more realistic) and 600 people per metro train so it's more realistic and the whole game just got so much more fun. I had 2,000 people waiting at my busiest transit stations. I was so happy. It was everything sim city should have been.\n\n=== The Problems ===\n- My game crashes every hour. there's no auto save. But it does not crash on my brothers computer.\n- You can't upgrade current roads, you have to bulldoze them and when laying down the new road, if you curve or are off by 1 pixel the buildings around will be destroyed and you can't get them back.\n- There's no "undo" option. So if you accidentally destroy a building or are having trouble with rail connections (and you will a lot) you have to bulldoze everything and start over.\n- Trams can no longer do U-Turns on avenues like they used to.\n- The addition of depots is extremely limiting. ALL buses, metros, trams must start out and end at the same depot. So no more little bus routes.\n\nThe team worked really hard on this game, and the assets are top notch. I feel like just 2 more years of development and this game can be fleshed out into a serious Sim City Competitor. If you have problems with the umbalanced gameplay, low vehicle capacity, short break down times, just change the stats in the Rule Editor and game on.","February 2, 2014","true","50.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover."\n\nMark Twain once articulated these words many moons ago, but not once did he think that such an utterance would be so applicable to a virtual transportation simulator, which touches the hearts and minds of all thouse who immerse themselves in this one of a kind experience. The question for each man to settle is not what he would do if he had means, time, influence and educational advantages; the question is what he will do with the things he has. The moment a young man ceases to dream or to bemoan his lack of opportunities and resolutely looks his conditions in the face, and resolves to change them, he lays the corner-stone of a solid and honorable success. This success came to me when I cast logic and reason aside and invested into this life changing game.\n\nI believe that the happiness of life is made up of minute fractions—the little soon-forgotten charities of a kiss, a smile, a kind look, a heartfelt compliment in the disguise of a playful raillery, and the countless other infinitesimal of pleasurable thought and genial feeling.

The game is very simple and is, though sometimes tedious, very fun. Once you set your transportation empire going the sky is the limit. You can make routes for several public transport vehicles. You can make a bus line (good for short distances). You can make a trolley (looks cool). You can also, my favourite, make a tram line (very simple and fun).

CiM was somewhat a fun game but lacking a lot in comparisson to Sim City 4 which is the holy grail for this genre. However a lot of these aspects have been improved in the second version of the game. Unfortunately a lot of the aspects have gotten far worse.\nLets start with the city size. What is this? Cities counting 50.000 residents with full on highrise downtown? And of course you have to downgrade the people to this size. So we have mainlines with doubledecker busses carrying 30 people every hour? This is a simulation. And the year is 2014. How is it possible that no one has come as far as SC4 with it's regional play? I mean we have games now as vast and complex as GTA 5. A city sim with that kind of size shouldn't be such a big deal.\nThe next thing is the DLC. This is the bigggest crime comitted in the world of gaming right now. You pay 20€ for a notreallyalotmorethanashity game like this. Which includes 5 different vehicles. And then you have to buy each new vehicle? for like 1€ each? That's 20€ easily just to get to a diversity of a city with 30 bus lines and a couple of suburban rail lines.\nAnd don't even let me get started on the depots! The busses should not go back to depot after each and every run. Not even trains or trams do that! This concept should be changed!\nOh! Let's also not forget the bugs and bad simulator engine which causes flooding of vehicles on lines and sudenly causes a standstill in your city. Why did I even buy this?\n\nPeople should really start fighting for their right to a good quality games!","January 12, 2014","false","101.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There's an incredible amount of detail for the obsessive and careful, but something as basic and essential as building a bus line is cumbersome, and building a functioning fixed track transport like tram lines is frustrating and overly complicated.  I simply gave up after spending an hour trying to set up one tram line.  The track was always in the wrong place, you can't really drag the cursor to set up a long track line, meaning you have to build them piece by piece.  And then track connections are unreliable, particularly at intersections.  I take for granted in games like this that there's a learning curve and there's tricks you need to learn by trial and error to figure out how to do things, but considering the entire game is building a public transportation system, it should have been made easier.  Not less complex, but easier to execute.","January 10, 2014","false","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But I gave the game a shot as I wanted the trading cards...\n\nI got maybe 4-5 steps into the "tutorial", which wasn't intuative in the least, and just quit. The menus don't seem well laid out and remembering where every little item is makes me feel like I'd need to print out a giant poster of where every option is located under which menu and sub-menu in order to play, and that takes the fun out of a game for me.\n\nI can deal with games like SimCity or CitiesXL where I don't feel like I have no choice but to micromanage in order to play, which is the impression that this game gave me.\n\nThankfully, I got this in a HumbleBundle, so it's a bit easier to swollow.

CiM was somewhat a fun game but lacking a lot in comparisson to Sim City 4 which is the holy grail for this genre. However a lot of these aspects have been improved in the second version of the game. Unfortunately a lot of the aspects have gotten far worse.\nLets start with the city size. What is this? Cities counting 50.000 residents with full on highrise downtown? And of course you have to downgrade the people to this size. So we have mainlines with doubledecker busses carrying 30 people every hour? This is a simulation. And the year is 2014. How is it possible that no one has come as far as SC4 with it's regional play? I mean we have games now as vast and complex as GTA 5. A city sim with that kind of size shouldn't be such a big deal.\nThe next thing is the DLC. This is the bigggest crime comitted in the world of gaming right now. You pay 20€ for a notreallyalotmorethanashity game like this. Which includes 5 different vehicles. And then you have to buy each new vehicle? for like 1€ each? That's 20€ easily just to get to a diversity of a city with 30 bus lines and a couple of suburban rail lines.\nAnd don't even let me get started on the depots! The busses should not go back to depot after each and every run. Not even trains or trams do that! This concept should be changed!\nOh! Let's also not forget the bugs and bad simulator engine which causes flooding of vehicles on lines and sudenly causes a standstill in your city. Why did I even buy this?\n\nPeople should really start fighting for their right to a good quality games!","January 12, 2014","false","101.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I want my money back with the game out of my library or CIM 2011. CIM 2 deffinetly is a step back, taking out and dulling qualities that were present in the origonal. Do not buy unless you watch actual game play videos.

If you buy the base game you will find only 5 maps (including a tiny tutorial map) and very few vehicles. The metro, which is supposed to be the backbone of any serious city transportation system, only has 2 trains available and are pretty much the worst ones. All decent maps/vehicles come from either the community or paid DLCs. You don't get much from the base game.\n- Stupid depot system. Yes the vehicle depot is added in CiM2, which some people might consider it an improvement. However I find it too often that my depot becomes too full and too many scheduled departures missed.\n- Lack of tutorial. With so many new features added why not add a serious tutorial to explain the complicated features? CiM1 has, in my opinion, a very decent tutorial mission.\n- The construction of the metro is very troublesome. Maybe I'm wrong, but it's very difficult to construct an underground metro line within the city. The elevation just don't match. (In CiM2 you can adjust the elevation freely with your pageup/pagedown keys, while in CiM1 you only have 5 levels: 3 underground, ground level and elevated.) This problem is made worse by the underground depot, which I have never successfully connected to any underground line. So far 70% of my metro lines are either overhead or on the ground, and all depots are on the ground.\n\nIn conclusion, while some people may cheer the new added features, I must say that I enjoyed CiM1 better than CiM2 even when I try hard to switch from 1 to 2. Would rather recommend version 1 to anyone who does not want to smash their computer and/or keyboard while playing a simulation game.","January 28, 2015","false","19.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

It Disapeared even if it was a good one!\n\nNow to the game. Well I can't recomand it, after you get trough the first few hours you really start to have fun which than will crush within hours. There is no big variety of busses. The KI is pretty Stupid, for some reason on some Depots they can't decide to drive in or drive out. After you know how to work you can easily win any game. There is really not allot to do in this game.\nAlso this game makes you whish you would have the african swallow back from simcity2000 because it maximum speed is just so slow. Also the strangest thing is, the trick to win is not to make alot money but to make just enough to pay of your loans! Yep if you wanna go anywhere in this game you just take loan after loan expanding and never ever pay it back in the playtrough because it takes so damn long time to pay it back. So I end up using nearly a million Whatever they are paying with as loan and just try to keep a positve cashflow. How Ironic!. Also the Cars break down so easily. If you don't have enough cars or trams or anything they just break constantly because it is more sensibel to trash the few busses than just let the people stay, which will they do eventuelly because the busses will break constantly. Also most city streats are not really good layed out, you can build new streets but sometimes the building will just disapear from that.\n\nIt does allot of things good which I never have seen before but than again when did we ever had a city trafic game? Normaly we have games that go between cities. But I can't recomand this not if there are games like Transport Tycoon which is free novadays or Railroad Tycoon. I expecially like railroad tycoon 2. Maybe you just have trains but you have allot of different goods with midstation like the grain into the backery which produces than food and you can deliefer that to the people in the cities. Also the trains that are available are huge, so many fantastic trains and so many of them. But if you like maybe more different transportation than go and download Open TTD, it is just so awesome, so many different vehicels and actually the same as I can say to Railroad Tycoon but best of all not everything at the same time, it comes from time to time.\n\nIf those features where in Cities in Motion 2 I could recomend it but as it is right now it is just not good.","February 19, 2015","false","12.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Buses, trolleybuses, trams, trains and boats will pave the way to fame for your city...'s transportation system.\n\nThis game's tutorial is possibly worse than the one in Driver on the PlayStation. I can't even begin to explain where they went wrong. Seriously, just google how to play the game. Some random polish bloke could do a better job at showing people how to play the game than CiM2, which tells you to just build a metro without telling you, well, how to build the metro.\nNext, trying to get the vehicles going is a pisstake. I'd have an easier time keeping Chuck Norris captive using only a roll of gaffatape and  and a defunct N64. Make a line, buy vehicles, assign stops to the line, stick the vehicles to the line's depot (which by the way is mandatory) and only then are you lesss than 3 steps away from getting a line going.\n\nOnce you get all of this going, and everything begins to spludge into shape, there's a beautifully crafted RTS involving transporting the masses on a train which kind of looks like a pelican bird while maintaining cash and the what nots that are needed. Sadly, though, it's overcrowded by quicly slapped together tutorials, horrid gameplay systems, and an overall unpleasant experience.\n\nThe only good things I can think about mostly revolve around graphics and the effeciancy system which makes you build these systems as effeciently as possible, otherwise people will just drive or walk there.\n\nVerdict: Buy Prison Architect instead.\n4/10. It's not very not all that not good.\n\nPS: Also, this game is very empty on content without any DLC packs. Oh yay.**\nA note to Admiral Denbigh: Get this out of your wishlist. Pronto.\n\n*With the resources being cash. The only thing that really stops you in this game is how bulky your pockets are.\n**That's a sin of video gaming.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChromeLynx/recommended/225420/","ChromeLynx","ChromelynX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChromeLynx/","96 products in account","I guess it's easy to hate on SimCity with this review. We can go on all day about how ♥♥♥♥ that game was, but that'd be praising Cities In Motion 2 on the account of it's main competitor being ****. I won't do that. Instead, I'll relate to another game. One that has a lot more love.\n\nI will relate this game to Transport Tycoon. Because this game is much more similar to that game in many respects.\n\nLike TT, Cities In Motion is a game about building transport systems. The scale is limited to a large city rather than a large land, and the cargo variety is minimized to just passengers, but for the rest, it's very much like TT. And that's kind of that.\n\nBeyond that, CiM2 has a lot of different stuff. You build stops and direct bus lines through them. One bus line may not yield much. But when that line links up to a different line, not necessarily a bus line, people along the second line will use the first line too if they need to go there. Passengers go places and your transport systems are there to help that be possible without needing to pick up a car.\n\nThe roadbuilding is very free-form. Just click a point, and then another, and it'll connect them with a straight line. Click a third point, and it'll create a nice curve. Keep clicking new points and you have a scribble. Or a long line. Or a long curve. Click the last point and the road is built. It's very simple.\n\nHowever, this game has some problems of it's own. Let's start off with the biggest problem: stability. The game runs on Unity. And while Unity is pretty good at making decent games, it does suffer from a minor stability issue, where the game crashes due to a GetThreadContextException. If you save a lot, the game will remain manageable, and the progress loss will be minor, but it is a nuisance that is common in Unity games.\n\nThe UI may require a little direction, but is manageable once you've completed the tutorial. The tutorial does miss a few mechanics, though. For instance, you'll need to go to Reddit or the wiki to find out how to work with water buses and trolleys, although the latter is similar to the trams in many ways.\n\nThen there's some missing features which'll leave most players going WTF MATES?! One thing I miss is the ability to change roads without having to demolish them.\n\nNext, there's difficulty. While metros are a massive investment, if you get major corners of a city connected, you'll earn it all back in a single afternoon. In the days that follow, you spend most of your time getting rid of the passenger back-ups that are caused by the vast new amount of transport opportunities. And while you'd expect 50% coverage is an easy feat, it's surprisingly difficult. But with no competition and the lack of a loss condition, there is limited challenge.\n\nThe last complaint I have is the fact that at the moment (2014-03-23) I think some of the DLC has a fairly poor content/value balance. Furthermore, there's multiple packages that are very focused on owners of the older Cities In Motion. Despite that, some DLC does offer some nice changes. For instance, the Metro DLC completely overhauls the mechanics of the Metros, making the whole system a lot deeper. Fortunately, there is no vital DLC. The game is perfectly playable without any DLC. I do believe that the DLC offers a lot of options that are better than the standard options though.\n\nDespite that, it has some nice things. For one, the world looks very good. I find it very relaxing to for instance just position my camera over a suburban surface railway station and just watch the trains come and go. Also, the passenger simulation has a great, but manageable level of detail. It quickly becomes noticeable if that multi-million dollar metro line was really worth covering the entire city for, but passengers use it and existing lines that barely made the cut have now become viable, so it probably is. You can get a lot of information about the state of your city and your company by looking at the data views, and some of that information can tell you very useful stuff, like if it's a good idea to use the highway, or to build a dedicated route, as well as if a line is likely to provide your system with a good amount of traffic.\n\nOn the whole, I think this is a good game. It has it's flaws, yes, like relatively high DLC prices, roads being impossible to upgrade without having to tear them down, and some other minor nuisances. But it's good looking, plays fairly well, and if you're a perfectionist and immense fan of making a perfect transport system, this'll keep you busy for hours.","March 22, 2014","true","83.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Since you can build roads SimCity style, it now feels more like a city simulator restricted to running the department of transportation than a straight-up business simulation. It has a lot more depth (like the timetables and depots), but it doesn't take long to get the hang of what's new.

But the game design isn't the best one, since it isn't as "realistic" as the design of the classic CIM. Moreover you have to build your transport networks in "futuristic american" cities which aren't  really cities (but Tutorial City :D).

Went there and found out the game was actually discontinued back in 2013, and so was the forums.\n\nThey still have Cities Skylines forum open but CiM2 is closed and it seems they're not interested in supporting this title at all - which I have a big question - if your not supporting it why on earth are you still selling it???  If it can't run on modern OS this should be made clear in the description that it's not compatible with Windows 10.  The only thing I can see is that minimum requirements mentions XP/7/8 and 10 isn't listed, but many other games also don't list 10 as it's a new OS\n\nFrom what I can see it seems mono library is something to do with VC++ however as Windows 10 has a later edition of VC++ there isn't any way of getting it to use the older version of VC++ that this mono.dll is compatible with, so if you've upgraded to Windows 10 don't bother with this game 'cos it wont work - I'm now probably going to try and get it running on a Linux box and hopefully get it working so I wont have wasted my money.","November 28, 2015","false","1.9"," 23 of 48 people (48%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","48","23","48","4","3"

Not much to it and not much to do in it. Played campaign for a while but it just became a waiting game so it got boring fast especially when triple speed is still super slow, sand box is just as slow except you can have infinte money. Buses work great but the other modes of transport seemed to not work for me and placing roads and tracks was just a hassle, overall i wouldnt recommend this game.

I love dealing with logistics and transport routes, and while this game could have had more, it had everything needed to build a whole mass transit system...\n\nbut there is one game-breaking bug that makes this game pointless to play...\n\npassengers will run around in a circle around the stop, and never board a vehicle, and the driver isn't smart enough to close the doors and keep on going... "you had your chance to get on, you missed it..."\n\nthe vehicle just sits there, forever, waiting on the passenger that WON'T BOARD... backing up all the traffic behind it.\n\nright now I literally have a hundred vehicles, all trapped behind 2 of these bugs in different places, and the only way to get them moving again is to turn the routes off and back on, removing all the vehicles to depot... which does no good, as they will just get trapped again.\n\nCities Skylines, focuses on city building... it has some transport support, but you don't get much control over it.\nCities in Motion 2, focuses on transport... it has some city building support, but you don't get much control over it.\n\nIf they would only merge the two games, giving us the city building of Skylines, and the transport  complexity of Cities in Motion 2, it would be perfect...\n\nI highly recommend Skylines even with its drawbacks... the bugs aren't game-breaking...\n\nDo yourself a favor and save your money, as buying Cities in Motion 2, is just a ripoff at this point. Until they fix this bug (and I don't expect them to ever bother with CiM2 again, as it appears to no longer be supported), there is no point in playing.\n\nI don't even think it should continue to be sold at this point. Steam should remove it. Keeping games like this available, in this condition, reflects badly on Steam, and they should have higher standards about the titles they associate with their brand.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME... You will only end up feeling ripped off...\n\n-- Smoov\n","December 15, 2015","false","172.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Maybe a good screensaver.\n\nAt my last attempt I downloaded a fine sandbox world with no buildings to freebuild my own city. But again, you cant say, what the city is building.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Joaten/recommended/225420/","Joaten","Yung Joaten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Joaten/","81 products in account","I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.\n\nFive score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity.\n\nBut one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize an shameful condition.\n\nIn a sense we've come to our nation's Capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.\n\nThis note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nIt is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check; a check which has come back marked "insufficient funds."\n\nBut we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.\n\nWe have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.\n\nNow is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.\n\nIt would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.\n\nBut there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.\n\nThe marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.\n\nAnd as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, "When will you be satisfied?"\n\nWe can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.\n\nWe can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.\n\nWe cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.\n\nWe can never be satisfied as long as our chlidren are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating "for whites only."\n\nWe cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.\n\nNo, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.\n\nI am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.\n\nGo back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.\n\nI say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.\n\nI have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal."\n\nI have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.\n\nI have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.\n\nI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\n\nI have a dream today.\n\nI have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.\n\nI have a dream today.\n\nI have a dream that one day every valley shall be exhalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.\n\nThis is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.\n\nWith this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.\n\nThis will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning, "My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.

Because they are bug, they are really bad behavior and Colossal didn't fix it because it was too much money, not enought profit.\n\nAnd then the UX, It's quite nice to do line, and I must admit that I got pleasure planning my line. The road creation is nice, really advanced. But they miss completly the relation between time and vehicule speed. 11km can take 8 hour for tram, without traffic. What's the point? I is faster to walk. This can be ok because it's a simulation. But they included timetable. How to you want to manage "real time"  with vehicule take a whole day to do a circuit. They is a limit to say "it's a simulation". Even a simulation need to be coherent.\n\nThen I think this game got really good base, and the principle is nice, but there is an evident lack of caring about the gamer.

Hilariously game-breaking dynamic urbanisation mechanic. Extremely little map content. Pointless, inflexible "campaign" mode. Metric tons of micromanagement. More eye-pleasing cities? NEIN. And most importantly, an extremely user-hostile network construction method. No thanks to my OCD, I usually spend over 12 hours just to plan ONE perfect metro line. The lack of assistance to deal with the gridless game engine is really taxing on my rigid SC4-style urban planning skills.

In fact, I gave it several different tries. It's just not a very good sim game. The cities that you start the campaign with are huge and the tutorial really doesn't help much. I would have rather started on a city the size of the tutorial city and worked my way up. The font sizes are tiny and not very easy to read and the cities are hard to work around in due to the designs. This game would have benefited from a change from super-realistc graphics to something a little more cartoon-ish. I don't need ultra-realistic to run a transportation company. I just need easy-to-work controls.\n\nLike I said, I really did want to like this game, but it's just not very fun.","January 13","false","2.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MostPowerful/recommended/225420/","MostPowerful","Siontix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MostPowerful/","192 products in account","I think the game is good, but not better than CiM 1--in my opinion.\n\nThe immediate reason I bought this game was very simply because of the fact that it contains multiplayer, which the first game did not. Unfortunately, this game just seems too different from the first.\n\nMy very first mistake was my incompetence of reading more negative reviews. Because little did I know, all of the cities in this game are fictional. One thing I loved about Cities in Motion was that you could play in cities like Berlin, Tokyo, Frankfurt, etc. I don't like playing in fictional cities, and while you can indeed simply create your own city in the editor (or get a map off of the workshop,) that's not for me. I much prefer official things. They did release a European Cities DLC that adds Prague, Liverpool, and one German city; but I really don't want to pay more money for this. I feel that historical cities should have just been added from the start, but instead, I forsee that we'll have to either buy what should have came with the game from the start, or rely on player created historical cities (which are pretty good, actually.)\n\nSecondly, I (Remember: My opinion) dislike the drastic change with scheduling, depots, etc. I liked how simple it was in the first game. You build some bus stops, buy a bus, set up a line, and watch progress be made. Now you must work with a time schedule--which many may agree is an awesome update, but I much prefer keeping it like the first game. I at least wish there was an option to play the original way--perhaps a "classic" mode. If they implemented this, I would definitely switch this over to a positive and buy this for my friends.\n\nAgain, that's just why I don't recommend this game. Many--if not most--will actually find this game much more improved over the first. I jumped into this game expecting the exact same thing as the first game, but alas, there's a whole new learning curve to adjust to. So to sum it up: This game is a more realistic version of the first game.\n\nI'm going to continue playing this game, as I believe I've gotten the ropes down. But boy, I sure wish the first game was multiplayer co-op.","October 11, 2014","false","5.0"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

It will not quench your thirst for Sim City 4 or Transport Tycoon but it sits somewhere in the middle and it does a good job at it. I do not play it for the side missions but I do often play it in a sandbox mode with unlimited money.

Can you tell by how many hours I've logged? When I read the reviews to see what people were saying, I was surprised. I'll start with a list of pro's and con's and then some thoughts on the game.\n\nPROS  This game is in-depth. If you like trains and building transit infrastrcutre, then this is your game\nMaps can be HUGE. You can even design your own maps in the editor (with or without any starting city)\nVehicular choice. There are a wide array of transportation options available to you to choose.\nYou aren't pigeon-holed.\nDon't like trains? Use trams, or buses, or water ferries, or monorails, you have lots of options\nThe city grows as you get better public infrastructure, and changes in response to what you do.\nCONS  Trains tracks were hard to understand how to successfully build at first\nOnce you get the hang of it, it's SUPER FUN.\nStoryline progression could be better, the campaign just felt like I was playing in sandbox mode\nGame time can be REALLY slow, this is my biggest irk about the game.\nBy gametime I mean, how fast does time progress in the game.\nThere isn't a good way to build central hubs of transportation (Multiple train lines, in a way that makes sense)\nTHOUGHTS I've read some of the reviews where people said it was too much like managing a public transit company. DUH! That's what the game is about. That's its draw. It is not a city builder (although, the same company is making a city builder called Cities: Skylines. SO EXCITED). But this game is meant to be all about public transit, and it does a damn good job at it.\nLiving in a large metropolitan city, I love how I can replicate and even do a better job than the current metro system I have access to. If you are on the fence about getting this game, DO IT! BUY THE GAME; IT IS AWESOME.\nK, nuff said.\n","December 20, 2014","true","189.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And, ultimately while I think it's good, it's not quite ever going to be a classic of the genra that Railroad Tycoon II is.\n\nIn many ways the compairison is a fair one. Both games focus on transportation logistics. In the scenarios I describe, both games focus on moving passengers through an urban envrioment. That's where they start to differ. Cities in Motion 2 is zoomed in quite a bit. You have to plan your trackwork, or overhead wires block by block. You have a dozen different modes of transportation to work with, not just a station and a station radius. You plan individual trips for your vehicles on the route and you have to worry about rush hour and adding extra capacity for peak times in Cities in Motion. Where the defining unit of time is a year in Railroad Tycoon, it is a day in Cities in Motion.\n\nThe sad thing is this detail is incomplete in many ways. You can't get your subways or trams to revers direction in place, for example. You can't forbid left or right turns when modifying the road work. And, unless you spring for the DLC, you only get 3 choices for each type of vehicle.\n\nThe day-night cycle and rush-hour are interesting logistically, but it causes the financial model to feel weird. You might spend hours of wall time waiting for your operation to turn enough of a profit so you can expand. And the random objectives often seem to ask you to do something non-sensical, or don't even work right at all. l\n\nI'm somewhat willing to forgive these gameplay issues because I love the genra and the core gameplay does something that's very ambicious very well. It simualtes (or does a good job pretending to simulate) the movements of thousands citizens's daily lives. While traffic routing (particularly without the road building tools I described) can do some dumb thing from time to time, it mostly works very well and your public transit system fits right in with it. I like this game, and if this review sounds at all negative, it's beause it's tough being compared to what I reguard as the greatest game of all time.","July 14, 2014","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In short the game is a step above the original and a good game overall but it's not perfect.\n\nGraphically the game looks really nice for the type of game it is and even when you zoom in it still looks good if not groundbreaking. Sounds are ok but not the best when you sit and listen to them but TBH when immersed in the game you tend not notice them as much so doesn't really bother me.\n\nThe UI being a major part of this game is an area that is both good and bad at the same time. First off to me it looks rather plain and nopt very stylish but on the other hand all the options you could need are there and laid out in nice manner so it's easy to navigate to what you want once you've played a few games and know where things are. Also i like the fact that when you click on a specific sectiion it opens it up in a window that can be moved about and this is useful if you want to manage/look at several things at once which can easily be done. One issue i have that could be game/UI relates is when selecting create a new route it doesn't auto select the tool to start adding stops which i feel it should do plus if you delete a stop i.e. you added the wrong one, it de-selects the add stops and many times i have clicked on a stop thinking it's adding it only to find i have just viewed it rather than adding to my lines stops.\n\nNow gameplay is another major part of this game and i must say in the short time i've played the game i can't praise it enough. Placing depot's, adding stops, creating routes, building roads and generally building up your transport empire works exactly how you would want. Also managing various aspects like your finances, current routes, planning future routes and future expansions is also fun despit these seeming mundane.\n\nOverall Cities in Motion 2 is a great game for those looking for transport business style sim or those looking for something a bit different to Sim City. Of course the game is not without it's flaw but none the less it's still fun and here's hoping Colossal Order Ltd. and Paradox bring us a 3rd installment that builds upon and improves upon this","June 26, 2014","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are given specific goals from the City and from other people in the city as 'side quests'.\n\nThe campaign mode in CIM2 is very disappointing compared to the first game.  In CIM1, every senario starts in a completely different situation for each city included, and had many tasks to be completed for each one.  So even though you may play in the same city more than once, the situation changes enough to make it interesting.  In CIM2 there are only 5 cities in the campaign, which is not a big problem, except how those cities are used makes it disappointing.  First, each senario typically only has one mail goal, which is usually pretty simple, such as attain a certain level of coverage, or company value growth.  The real problem comes when you return to a city later in the campaign, you are playing in the exact same city you left, with everything you already completed still there ready to go.\n\nThere are some good things about this game.  The graphics engine is definitely improved, although the overall user interface is not really improved.  Cities will grow and change over time.  For people who really enjoy micromanagement, you can set very specific schedules for each line you create.  You can also create custom metro trains for each line, however I do wish there was a method to save each custom train for easier purchasing and managing.\n\nThe game is still fun to play, but I would only recommend buying it when it is on sale.","January 12, 2014","true","140.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Frequent network disconnects, and a broken save system makes it too easy to corrupt and be unable to reconnect with your partner.\n\nThe interface is really bad in general.  And some vital flaws with the campaign makes it lose its challenge.  Like being able to make your city just barely profitable, then leave your computer running over night one the fastest time factor and coming back to be ridiculously rich.   A simple solution here would have been putting time limits on missions, or making people become more and more upset with lack of public transportation over time, or anything really.  It just makes the rest of your efforts seem worthless.   I ended up enjoying the game more by self imposing time limits on myself.\n\nIf you can overcome all that, the game has a lot of enjoyable moments.\n\nOh, and you probably need a decent computer to run this game well without weird stuttering when panning the camera around on high settings.","December 27, 2013","true","99.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And, ultimately while I think it's good, it's not quite ever going to be a classic of the genra that Railroad Tycoon II is.\n\nIn many ways the compairison is a fair one. Both games focus on transportation logistics. In the scenarios I describe, both games focus on moving passengers through an urban envrioment. That's where they start to differ. Cities in Motion 2 is zoomed in quite a bit. You have to plan your trackwork, or overhead wires block by block. You have a dozen different modes of transportation to work with, not just a station and a station radius. You plan individual trips for your vehicles on the route and you have to worry about rush hour and adding extra capacity for peak times in Cities in Motion. Where the defining unit of time is a year in Railroad Tycoon, it is a day in Cities in Motion.\n\nThe sad thing is this detail is incomplete in many ways. You can't get your subways or trams to revers direction in place, for example. You can't forbid left or right turns when modifying the road work. And, unless you spring for the DLC, you only get 3 choices for each type of vehicle.\n\nThe day-night cycle and rush-hour are interesting logistically, but it causes the financial model to feel weird. You might spend hours of wall time waiting for your operation to turn enough of a profit so you can expand. And the random objectives often seem to ask you to do something non-sensical, or don't even work right at all. l\n\nI'm somewhat willing to forgive these gameplay issues because I love the genra and the core gameplay does something that's very ambicious very well. It simualtes (or does a good job pretending to simulate) the movements of thousands citizens's daily lives. While traffic routing (particularly without the road building tools I described) can do some dumb thing from time to time, it mostly works very well and your public transit system fits right in with it. I like this game, and if this review sounds at all negative, it's beause it's tough being compared to what I reguard as the greatest game of all time.","July 14, 2014","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In short the game is a step above the original and a good game overall but it's not perfect.\n\nGraphically the game looks really nice for the type of game it is and even when you zoom in it still looks good if not groundbreaking. Sounds are ok but not the best when you sit and listen to them but TBH when immersed in the game you tend not notice them as much so doesn't really bother me.\n\nThe UI being a major part of this game is an area that is both good and bad at the same time. First off to me it looks rather plain and nopt very stylish but on the other hand all the options you could need are there and laid out in nice manner so it's easy to navigate to what you want once you've played a few games and know where things are. Also i like the fact that when you click on a specific sectiion it opens it up in a window that can be moved about and this is useful if you want to manage/look at several things at once which can easily be done. One issue i have that could be game/UI relates is when selecting create a new route it doesn't auto select the tool to start adding stops which i feel it should do plus if you delete a stop i.e. you added the wrong one, it de-selects the add stops and many times i have clicked on a stop thinking it's adding it only to find i have just viewed it rather than adding to my lines stops.\n\nNow gameplay is another major part of this game and i must say in the short time i've played the game i can't praise it enough. Placing depot's, adding stops, creating routes, building roads and generally building up your transport empire works exactly how you would want. Also managing various aspects like your finances, current routes, planning future routes and future expansions is also fun despit these seeming mundane.\n\nOverall Cities in Motion 2 is a great game for those looking for transport business style sim or those looking for something a bit different to Sim City. Of course the game is not without it's flaw but none the less it's still fun and here's hoping Colossal Order Ltd. and Paradox bring us a 3rd installment that builds upon and improves upon this","June 26, 2014","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was a huge fan of the earlier Sim City games, and after they ruined the latest incarnation, I've been looking for a game to jump to.\n\nUnfortunately, Cities in Motion 2 just isn't all that fun.  There was nothing there that hooked me into the game, and got me trying to jump to the next step.  I think the main problem is that you just start with an already-complete city and have to add transport to it.  That just feels too much like *work*, rather than building up your own city in the style you like, which is *play*.","June 24, 2014","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The maps which you work with are very realistic with great attention to detail. All the cars, people, buildings and objects run as if it was a real world. For example; if you follow a random citizen who works in the city, you'll notice that he/she will leave in the morning to head to his/her workplace in either a personal car or a pt (public transport) vehicle. He/she may either travel to a office building in the city, or possibly a factory. He/she will then come back to his/her house in the evening. You will then have to look at how you may provid public transport for the citizen.\n\nIf theres one thing that should be changed, it should be the waterbuses. I do not use them often, because I find them hard to use. They are also not effective, as not as many people catch waterbuses, as they may do for trains or buses. They should instead use monorails. They would be more fun to use. If you would like monorails in the game, there is a new DLC for it. It is also currently %50 off (25/6/14).\n\n-Jimes105 (Find me on youtube!)","June 24, 2014","true","80.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like this game and finished the campaign for it. It's not difficult to win once you get a feel for what the different transport types can support and how to space them out to give good service(hint: try following a grid, <5 minutes round trip for any one line). It can be very relaxing, even when you're doing poorly, and there are plenty of options for setting up a complex network even without the DLC additions.\n\nI have two issues with the game:\n\nThe first is that track and stop placement can be tedious and error-prone, depending on which type of transit you're working with. Although the majority of the time, you want your tram and trolley lines(which are built at street level) to either continue straight ahead or take a 90-degree bend, you have to carefully click each road segment and scroll each time, which, combined with the low visibility of these constructions, almost guarantees that you mess up and fail to link one of the segments and then have to go back and debug it when the game tells you the route can't reach a stop. There is no tool to simplify this construction phase, even though the game can adequately plan the entire route for you when you use buses on existing roads - so you may spend a LOT of time squinting and clicking. Similarly, when building underground roads or metro lines, there is no way to view through the roads, which means that when you go to add stops, you have to either work extremely hard to position the camera to see through a road, build around the road, or tear up the road and add it again.\n\nA lazy player is going to want to build only buses, watertaxis and underground metros that consciously avoid overlapping the road.\n\nThe second problem is with the city growth model. To induce growth, all a player has to do is build new roads with sidewalks, and improve overall transit service. The player doesn't get any control over what types of zones appear, even though they're relevant to decisions about transit scheduling and peak service. This makes city growth feel very "one size fits all" - the growth is generic so you have to build generically - and since you can add roads anywhere that the terrain will fit, the simplest growth strategy is rinse-and-repeat: build a new metro line, and build roads on top of it. When I discovered this it  detracted from any sense of individual character amongst cities. Growth can be turned off, at the expense of making the game feel more like a static "fill in the blanks" exercise.","February 13, 2014","true","182.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay itself is fun, as you build a mass transit system for a small town or large city.  Making the trains run on time, setting prices, and satisfying your customers all makes for a fun game.\n\nHowever, there are a host of bugs that I've experienced that decrease my experience in the game, specifically with additional content downloaded from the Steam workshop.  The Steam workshop is great, with alot of new maps and add-ons making the game so much better.  Unfortunately the maps tend to get buggy at times, resulting in corrupted save games, with hours of work lost.\n\nNevertheless, the stock game itself is good, and I still recommend this game, especially if you are a fan of the SimCity series, or the original Cities in Motion, or even Tycoon games.","June 8, 2014","true","41.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It allows you to totally focus on the transportation aspect of managing a city.  It features a variety of transportation options like busses, trolleys, light rail (they call them trams), metro lines, and ferries.  I've tried both campaigns and sandbox, and find the sandbox to be more enjoyable.  In the campaign, I'd get upset that it would move on just as I was starting to get the city the way I liked it.\n\nThere are some klunky parts.  For example, if you want to change a street to add a lane or designate a lane as a bus lane, you have to demolish it and re-create.  Any transportation stops along that street are also demolished and removed from your routes.  You then have to re-create those as well after you're done the construction.\n\nWhen setting up routes initially, you determine the order of the stops.  However, if you add a stop later, the AI determines where it will go.  This is usually placed logically, but there are times that it would be nice to adjust it.\n\nBuilding metros can be a challenge with the underground view.  It's not possible to turn off the surface streets, and this hides parts of the metro you're trying to build.\n\nAlso, as soon as you start the game for the first time, go into settings and turn on the option to scroll the map by moving the cursor to the edge.  By default, you have to use keyboard commands to move the map.  I almost gave up on the game when first playing, because this was so difficult to do.  It's a whole different game with the scroll turned on.  I'm not sure why the default is off.\n\nAll in all, though, I highly recommend this game.","February 19, 2015","true","252.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There was nothing there that hooked me into the game, and got me trying to jump to the next step.  I think the main problem is that you just start with an already-complete city and have to add transport to it.

The maps which you work with are very realistic with great attention to detail. All the cars, people, buildings and objects run as if it was a real world. For example; if you follow a random citizen who works in the city, you'll notice that he/she will leave in the morning to head to his/her workplace in either a personal car or a pt (public transport) vehicle. He/she may either travel to a office building in the city, or possibly a factory. He/she will then come back to his/her house in the evening. You will then have to look at how you may provid public transport for the citizen.\n\nIf theres one thing that should be changed, it should be the waterbuses. I do not use them often, because I find them hard to use. They are also not effective, as not as many people catch waterbuses, as they may do for trains or buses. They should instead use monorails. They would be more fun to use. If you would like monorails in the game, there is a new DLC for it. It is also currently %50 off (25/6/14).\n\n-Jimes105 (Find me on youtube!)","June 24, 2014","true","80.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And, ultimately while I think it's good, it's not quite ever going to be a classic of the genra that Railroad Tycoon II is.\n\nIn many ways the compairison is a fair one. Both games focus on transportation logistics. In the scenarios I describe, both games focus on moving passengers through an urban envrioment. That's where they start to differ. Cities in Motion 2 is zoomed in quite a bit. You have to plan your trackwork, or overhead wires block by block. You have a dozen different modes of transportation to work with, not just a station and a station radius. You plan individual trips for your vehicles on the route and you have to worry about rush hour and adding extra capacity for peak times in Cities in Motion. Where the defining unit of time is a year in Railroad Tycoon, it is a day in Cities in Motion.\n\nThe sad thing is this detail is incomplete in many ways. You can't get your subways or trams to revers direction in place, for example. You can't forbid left or right turns when modifying the road work. And, unless you spring for the DLC, you only get 3 choices for each type of vehicle.\n\nThe day-night cycle and rush-hour are interesting logistically, but it causes the financial model to feel weird. You might spend hours of wall time waiting for your operation to turn enough of a profit so you can expand. And the random objectives often seem to ask you to do something non-sensical, or don't even work right at all. l\n\nI'm somewhat willing to forgive these gameplay issues because I love the genra and the core gameplay does something that's very ambicious very well. It simualtes (or does a good job pretending to simulate) the movements of thousands citizens's daily lives. While traffic routing (particularly without the road building tools I described) can do some dumb thing from time to time, it mostly works very well and your public transit system fits right in with it. I like this game, and if this review sounds at all negative, it's beause it's tough being compared to what I reguard as the greatest game of all time.","July 14, 2014","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It allows you to totally focus on the transportation aspect of managing a city.  It features a variety of transportation options like busses, trolleys, light rail (they call them trams), metro lines, and ferries.  I've tried both campaigns and sandbox, and find the sandbox to be more enjoyable.  In the campaign, I'd get upset that it would move on just as I was starting to get the city the way I liked it.\n\nThere are some klunky parts.  For example, if you want to change a street to add a lane or designate a lane as a bus lane, you have to demolish it and re-create.  Any transportation stops along that street are also demolished and removed from your routes.  You then have to re-create those as well after you're done the construction.\n\nWhen setting up routes initially, you determine the order of the stops.  However, if you add a stop later, the AI determines where it will go.  This is usually placed logically, but there are times that it would be nice to adjust it.\n\nBuilding metros can be a challenge with the underground view.  It's not possible to turn off the surface streets, and this hides parts of the metro you're trying to build.\n\nAlso, as soon as you start the game for the first time, go into settings and turn on the option to scroll the map by moving the cursor to the edge.  By default, you have to use keyboard commands to move the map.  I almost gave up on the game when first playing, because this was so difficult to do.  It's a whole different game with the scroll turned on.  I'm not sure why the default is off.\n\nAll in all, though, I highly recommend this game.","February 19, 2015","true","252.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dispereo/recommended/225420/","dispereo","dispereo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dispereo/","336 products in account","Cities in Motion 2 is a worthy successor in all regards. The city is now 3D and can be tilted in any direction. Most importantly the city development is now dynamic so less easy to predict and it also doesn't get quickly too boring unlike the first part where you basically repeated the same steps over and over again for the same result. The interface has been improved immensely and it's quite a lot of fun to develop the transit system. On top of that CiM2 was quite cheap, compared to the first part, however it comes with its downsides.\n\nYes, CiM2 is much cheaper (about half the price of its predecessor) however time is now being calculated in weeks and not in years anymore. As a result period vehicles have been abandoned and you are stuck with the vehicles you get from the beginning (3 busses, 2 trams, 3 trolleys, 2 waterbusses and 1 metro, as far as I remember). Everything else is DLC content, though quite surprisingly not all as expensive as with CiM1 (I probably was just lucky as everything but the bus/tram pack was on offer).\n\nCiM2 obviously - who would have expected - comes with quite some bugs (as the first one did), most importanly, it has a multiplayer, but we couldn't get it to work. We had to bypass the multiplayer problems by using Hamachi. Obviously not a solution. Many tiny but annoying issues with the interface, i.e. going underground still shows the overground streets, as a result a metro track under a street is basically unclickable. The usability suffers a bit, however has still greatly improved. Another issue seems to be the dynamic growth of the city, as sometimes three or more buildings of the same type are put right next to each other, which doesn't necessarily make sense (3 opera houses in the middle of the industrial zone).\n\nA massive improvement is the fact, that streets can be built, especially streets with bus lanes and many many more options which greatly improves the way you can build your tracks. This includes bridges and tunnels, metro now looks like the CiM1 train tracks and can be build over- and underground by simply using PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN, entrances for the stations are build automaticaly and off you go watching the people walking around like crazy popping out from one stop into the next one.\n\nEveryone who liked CiM1 should definitely get CiM2, despite the hickups and bugs and little annoyances - it's a great game. And though you might say "damn DLC" - the game can be played without the DLCs. Yes it's nice to have a choice of 2 metros instead of one, but in the end, you don't need it. Tell the game to send out a subway every 10mins instead of every 30min and you can compensate for the heavy usage. If you still would like to have the DLCs, check Steam for sales (only Bus DLC at the moment) or currently the other vehicles (Tram DLC, Waterbus and Trolley DLC) are cheaper in the Paradox store (however, you need to use Steam Wallet for that, which ones more makes nore sense, but they promised to make the rest of the DLCs available in Steam asap as well).","July 12, 2013","true","764.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll do my best to critique it fairly regardless.\n\nIn most regards, CiM2 competes with genre and industry giants such as anything produced by Maxis. So, any Sim game, really. CiM2 competes visually, audibly, in terms of detail, and in terms of objective. This is both positive and negative. It's positive because, while CiM2 certainly offers it's own unique brand of flavor in the Sim genre, it's still just another flavor. Whether you're mircromanaging public transit systems in CiM2 or micromanaging individual people's lives in the Sims 3, you're still just micromanaging aspects of human function.\n\nThat said, if you're into that, you'll love this. CiM2 is intricate, detail oriented to a fault, and undeniably rewarding to people with intense OCD.\n\nIf you don't have that, but still like micromanagement, you'll probably still find some measure of satisfcation from watching trains and busses make circuits.\n\nIf you're neither of those things, you won't like this. You'll probably enjoy it about as much as you enjoy actually riding public transit to get to your monotonous job as you micromanage your REAL life. Which is about as enjoyable as a sharp stick in the eye.\n\nSo there's that.","October 5, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not sure if this is the best way, but they seems to work.\n-Use buses the first few times. It's much easier to fix your mistakes.\n-Build large bus routes. They seems to work better than lots of small ones.\n-Try to have them connect to the seperate parts of the city. Crossing a bridge from a smaller part to one of the center islands increases ticket sales.\n-Use the Economic Panel. You can change ticket prices, employee salaries, take loans(dont recommend this), and see your weekly cash flow.\n-Don't increase ticket prices to much in the beginning. You will lose popularity.\n-Look at you individual lines. If you click on them they will tell you how many vehicles are required, your weekly income and expenses, and passenger reports. Check this to see if a route is making or losing money. I ended up removing 3 smaller lines when I first learned this because they were costing me nearly 3000 a week.\n-Connect your lines. Have two seperate lines use the same stop. It will allow you to transport them further without having to build a new line.\n-Be patient. It takes time for your lines to make money. It might be a good idea to just leave this on while you do something else for a while. Be sure to save whenever you come back to check on it, though, sometimes you will start to lose money for no apparent reason.","October 9, 2015","true","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While trying to join tracks for your metro system, you will constantly try and adgust it to fit perfectly in the way the game wants it to go. Then, the tram system. Trying to place a double track is a pain and has terrible intergration. The game lays it down and doesn't do it automatically. You have to manually click on every part of the road to place the tram track. Despite this negative feedback I reccomend this game more than the first because the graphics and controls are awesome and I enjoy the gameplay. Other than missing helicopters from the first, it allows you to customise the timetables, trains etc which is a great feature for someone like me who enjoys simulations. If you like graphics, controls and gameplay, get this game. If you prefer the story type of a game, get the first. If you want to improve your experience, buy the DLC!

First there is no vehicle modding for this game so you have to stick with the ingame buses (also means no trains or other real vehicles mods). The only good points for me are the graphics and the timetables system but that's it.  There is also more than 50 bucks of DLC's that add new vehicles (with some reuses from the first game) wich is a shame compared to the low amount of ingame content.","September 5, 2015","false","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not sure if this is the best way, but they seems to work.\n-Use buses the first few times. It's much easier to fix your mistakes.\n-Build large bus routes. They seems to work better than lots of small ones.\n-Try to have them connect to the seperate parts of the city. Crossing a bridge from a smaller part to one of the center islands increases ticket sales.\n-Use the Economic Panel. You can change ticket prices, employee salaries, take loans(dont recommend this), and see your weekly cash flow.\n-Don't increase ticket prices to much in the beginning. You will lose popularity.\n-Look at you individual lines. If you click on them they will tell you how many vehicles are required, your weekly income and expenses, and passenger reports. Check this to see if a route is making or losing money. I ended up removing 3 smaller lines when I first learned this because they were costing me nearly 3000 a week.\n-Connect your lines. Have two seperate lines use the same stop. It will allow you to transport them further without having to build a new line.\n-Be patient. It takes time for your lines to make money. It might be a good idea to just leave this on while you do something else for a while. Be sure to save whenever you come back to check on it, though, sometimes you will start to lose money for no apparent reason.","October 9, 2015","true","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A shame as it is a good game, and to be honest, I like the sandbox mode where you can build your own city, if they have a drive in your own city like Sim City 4  Rushhour did would make it a good city building game (well besides the fact that many of the buildings look the same).

Its biggest weakness is the lack of a good tutorial. When you're done with tutorial, you know about 5% of the game. Really... You are not learning anything useful. Especially if you are a player of Cities in Motion 1, you aren't learning something new with the tutorial. And that's why this game is so hard to play. The game is a big step higher in term of management and they are not teaching anything about this. So most people will give up before starting to enjoy it because they dont want to dig forever to find out how it works. And I guess this is the reason the reviews are so bad. I'll make mine a positive review even if I'm part of those disapointed people that don't understand half how the game works. Because I know it's a good game and a great step higher than Cities in motion 1. But still, I dont understand exactly how every features work and it's not making me wanna play more. This is sad. This game could have been a real blast to play if there was the appropriate tutorial to teach people how it works. That's something the dev could have upgraded. They could have get way better reviews and get more people interested into playing this game (especially now they released Cities Skyline which is a very popular and appreciated game).
