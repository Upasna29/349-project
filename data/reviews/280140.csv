The settings are nice and detailed but there is a lot of stock RPG-Maker characters in the background. The drawings of the main characters are nice but aren't consistent with their 2D-sprite (the main character wears a kimono in combat and a sleeveless dress out of combat).\nThere is a lot to customize (difficulty, randomness of the encounters, guiding arrows) and this is cool.\nNow, what prevented me to finish this game ? First and foremost, the scenario. It's just incredibly stupid, with caricatural characters and cheesy lines. What's the main motivation of the heroine ? She saw squirrels helping each others... I swear I'm not making this up.\nAnd I hope you're not allergic to giggles because you'll see a lot of them.\nHere's an example :\n- This forest looks so scary. We should head back home.\n- Come on. You're a guy, you shouldn't be afraid. *giggle*\nYes it's that bad.\n\nI could have overlooked this (with gritted teeth), but the dungeons are also far too long. And the numerous quests ?

If you like old-school rpgs and have been craving for the 2D goodness, this game might be for you.\n\nThe most annoying (and probably the only) issue with the game (series) is that when you will import your savefile to MM2, your player will be downgraded to Level 20 if they are higher and any promotions and enhancements you have given your character will be reseted to mainitain game continuity or something.\nSome people dig it, some people don't. I belong to the latter category.\n\nPS: If you want to test the game before purchasing it, there is a demo available at Aldorlea.org\n\nPPS: If you have an old save file lying around (like me), you can use it to quickly get some hard to get achievements. :-D","April 27, 2014","true","1.6"," 75 of 99 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","75","99","0","15"

The story is a simple one of a girl trying to come up with a way to change things in the world.  The characters are entertaining, the dungeons have interesting designs and the battles are fun.  It's a good start to what looks like will end up as a very epic adventure.\n\nPros:\n+Lots of hidden stuff.  There's quests to find, and random stuff to use all over the place if you just explore.  Seriously, just try and grab anything that looks like it can be picked up or looted, chances are good you get something from it.\n+Really nice music in all the areas.\n+Multiple difficulties and neat options to suit everyone.  Love that you can choose types of encounters even.\n+Can save pretty much anywhere, defiitely always a bonus.\n+A reasonable amount of challenge without needing a lot of grinding.  Even in the beginning when you suck and it may seem you can need it, this is balanced nicely with baskests that give experience to be found.\n+A lot of neat character interactions.\n\nNeutral points:\n\n&Especially in the beginning, gold is rather rare.  This can be annoying because you don't have many skills to heal, but it also can add some challenge in having to explore and make what you use really count and to think about what you buy and find spots where you can get rest for free, etc.  It also really made the point of the fact that these people are truly poor which helps really set the tone of how important Marine's quest is.\n&You only get a total of four party members, so not a lot of customization, but it's also a very solid party and that helped ensure no need to catch characters up who join later or caused certain characters to be relegated to never be used.\n\nCons:\n-It is the first of a series, so while this is a fun game, it's also more of a start of a bigger story than a complete plot.  It would be better to think of this as the first episode of a larger game and to keep in mind that if you enjoy this one, you'll definiely want the rest.\n-At some points, it was almost too easy or too difficult.  If it was hard, that was usually something I had missed, like finding a weapon for Benoit so he could actually hit for some damage, but some of the stuff that was supposed to be a challenge was far easier than I expected it to be even on the highest difficulty.  So definitely don't expect an immense challenge outside of a couple of boss batles, but it's also definitely not a walk in the park unless you play on lower difficulties.\n-It is pretty short, even on hard it is possible to complete under 10 hours, but a first playthrough is likely to take more around 15 hours to beat and 20 hours to find all the extras if you want all the achievements.\n\nAll in all though, I do recommend this game.  It has all the right elements to make for a fun RPG","December 17, 2014","true","31.9"," 43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","43","49","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saturdaythe13th/recommended/280140/","Saturdaythe13th","SaturdayXIII","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saturdaythe13th/","1385 products in account","This game must have done well as a high school project.  Based on the writing and overload of anime/rpg tropes I assume that's what it was made for.  I don't know why there are at least 5 of these Millennium games out there, but I think I have a pretty good idea why only one made it to Steam, and I'm quite surprised that it did.\n\nThis review is technically incomplete, because I haven't finished the game.  Everything could change, but I doubt that I'm going to get there.  I've been playing for 12 hours and have only obtained 4 out of 5 main characters.  That's not a measure of judgement in itself, but I am bored enough to say that I probably won't play much more.  Nothing is compelling me to play more.\n\nScale: 1=despised 2=negative 3=could go either way 4=positive 5=loved\n\nGame design: 4/5 As an RPG, this game does well in it's mechanics.  It's got some interesting methods to power up your characters and lots of variety for weapons and enemies.  The game play itself is actually quite commendable.  ... Except for the random jumping portions and other unseen elements, but you can't win them all.\n\nTone: 1/5 Here's the clincher for me.  This game is more of a first time fan fiction to JRPGs.  All these comments towards the immaturity of the writing of the game is because nothing happens for any reason.  Or at least for any understandable reason.  What's the conflict?  Big kindgom won't help struggling country side and wants them all to starve to death.  Solution?  Peasant girl is moved by squirrels helping each other and think that humans need to act more like squirrels (?).  Every one is sure to help each other and get along if only she can become leader of the kingdom in its next election.  The twist?  Democracy has failed!  The election is rigged.  Plus no one would want to vote for her anyway, but that's not really addressed.  Luckily the land has an anciet tradition for such times: "Martial Law".  When elections don't go the way you want, find a posse and beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of people until they listen.  If the game was trying to be ironic this would be great, but the sad music and dry story telling tell me it's trying to be heartfelt and inspiring.\n\nPersonal skew: 4/5 So the story sucks, does this ruin the game?  Not for everyone, sure, but the story is a major part of JRPG's and is especially important to this reviewer.  What made me stop playing the game is the inane dialogue that happens every scene.  I'm tired of clicking through a dozen text bubbles filled with 1 dimensional character banter complete with *chuckles* and *looks away sadly* remarks everytime a task is finished or started.  The characters aren't characters, they are tropes: ignorant, carefree, stubborn leader; sarcastic sidekick; cowardly tagalong; etc. and nothing in the miles of dialogue actually develops character or gives motivation.  I only know that the characters have these personalities because the other characters say so.  The cowardly tagalong seems quite reasonable to me.  I was suprised to learn  that the main character was "energetic" and carefree until she got sidekicks that obsessed about her every idea and action.  Even the quests that every new character demands develop nothing for the characters or story.\n\nSome people do like this game, and that's fine.  Hardcore fans are probably more geared toward gameplay.  Newbies probably appreciate the warm and simple storyline.  Maybe something changes later that will actually grip me to want to progress, but I don't want to risk another 10 hours on such a low possibility.","September 18, 2014","false","11.9"," 93 of 135 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","93","135","4","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexngregory/recommended/280140/","alexngregory","alex.n.gregory","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexngregory/","3023 products in account","Having just finished the Millennium series of RPGs, I thought I'd go back and review them one-by-one, in order, to see what they got right and wrong.\n\nMillennium: A New Hope is the first installment of a series that starts from very humble beginnings and blossoms into a wide-ranging story about class struggle, the power of friendship, and getting back up after you've been beaten down.\n\nAldorlea Games' releases over the last few years definitely appeal to a specific kind of audience. They deliberately go mid-market and target gamers who long for retro RPGs, and to that end, the Millennium series are some of the most polished you'll find around. Despite being made in RPGMaker, all of the games stand out due to their story, similar gameplay mechanics, secret rooms and hidden challenges.\n\nThe storytakes place in the land of Myst, with a teen named Marine coming home to discover that her father has fallen into a coma after being struck by a rock thrown by guards from the kingdom of Mystrock. The rulers of Mystrock erected a wall to keep commoners out, and as a result, the latter's quality of life is greatly deteriorating. Having become fed up with the situation, Marine opts to collect a cabal of warriors and take part in ritual leadership by combat in two weeks.\n\nA New Hope definitely seems like the most expansive of the installments (up until Battle of the Millennium), as it goes out of its way to introduce several large provinces and many different locations, including underground caverns and futuristic complexes. The combat system isn't necessarily as varied as some of the later games, but it does do a good job getting players up to speed on turn-based mechanics, as well as the use of magic and spells cast by Jeanne, a fairy who lives in Marine's earring.\n\nHonestly, the best way I can describe Marine is that she's an annoying kid who does things through sheer force of will. Most of the situations in the game (hell, in this entire series) are motivated by Marine having a hissy fit and complaining when reality gets in the way of her goals, and the people she argues against reluctantly conceding when she becomes stubborn and belligerent. Not to mention, a large amount of humor is mined out of the fact that it looks like she's talking to herself whenever she speaks with Jeanne (who no one else can see).\n\nThe whole aspect of what exactly Marine is going to do if/when she becomes the leader of Mystrock is never really addressed, as the narrative is constantly funnelling you through different setpieces and areas in order to get accustomed to the bizarreness of the gameworld (after all, robots, orcs, assassins and fairies are all present here, making it a mishmash of standard RPG races).\n\nThe most satisfying part of the storyline are the companions you meet along the way, ranging from a hand-to-hand master (Hirada) to a griffon tamer (Jezebel) to an albino crocodile hunter (Karine), all with their little quirks. You don't get much of a chance to see them grow beyond their initial roles, but they do progress quite nicely in future installments.\n\nDifficulty isn't very high, and despite the presence of "epic" animal bosses who can be found in various caves and rooms throughout Myst, they rarely pose much of a challenge, especially if you've grinded levels out and obtained the "promotions" from churches that greatly boost your stats. There's also a "rush" battle option that greatly alleviates the tedium of random mobs if you're grinding or are overleveled.\n\nThat's not to say it's all great, though. There are still problems with no minimap in any of the installments (which is one of my common frustrations with RPGMaker games in general), annoying enemies who can easily pop status effects on the party near the beginning of the game and a reliance on manually saving if you don't want to unintentionally get screwed over by spawning far away from a town or a church.\n\nThere are also a lot of sequel hooks that get set up, so much so that the only thing that was missing as a big red siren flashing "This is important" whenever certain characters appeared. NPCs like Gravitron and Merline have "I am future party member" status written all over them. Conversely, the villains are all one-note caricatures who seemingly have no depth or development whatsoever beyond the standard mustache-twirling.\n\nHowever, those negatives are minor in the grand scale of things. A New Hope is a solid, entertaining RPG with a lot of bang for the buck. The fact that you can carry all your gear, weapons and skills over to future installments (broken as they may be) is the icing on the cake.\n\nFor more reviews, visit my Curator page, Alex's RPG Recommendations!","August 27, 2015","true","18.9"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","30","35","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Submarine_Argument/recommended/280140/","Submarine_Argument","Submarine_Argument","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Submarine_Argument/","397 products in account","Overall, I really enjoyed Millennium - A New Hope.  It's a solid RPG with a good blend of challenge, interesting characters, story, secrets, large dungeons and a bit of humor.   If you hate RPG Maker games, you won't like it no matter what I write here, so keep that in mind.  For the rest of you, I'd say there's a lot to like in Millennium.\n\nThe game itself is a 5 part series, so keep that in mind when buying it.  If you're thinking about the Millennium series, you should start with this one (obviously).  You're then allowed to export your characters (with their inventories) to the next game after beating it.  There's at least 20 hours of gameplay here, I think I finished it in hard mode at about 25 hours.  I normally never play games on hard mode, but I did with Millennium and I enjoyed the challenge and extra achievements.  There are a number of interesting and challenging achievements for this game.  There are 24 secret rooms scattered throughout the world, 40 quests (both main and sidequests), and a lot of hidden things.\n\nCombat is fun and challenging.  The boss fights are pretty epic and there are optional tough "animal kings" for you to fight as an extra challenge after beating the main boss.   Level design is well executed.  The secret rooms are challenging to find and some of the dungons are HUGE with lots to explore.  Luckily, there is an option to have arrows occasionally point you in the right direction if you wish.  Unlike some other Aldorlea RPGs, you get the option to have enemies visible on the map instead of random encounter pop-ups after so many steps.   The plot is solid, if not ground breaking and keeps you on track.  I would say the plot speeds up and becomes more complex in M2.  The music was enjoyable as well.\n\nI only have a few complaints that are pretty minor.  Early in the game, gold is pretty rare!  You'll need to be a bit careful with your purchases.  The economy is tight so don't expect to buy 99 of every healing item, etc.   My only other complaint is that there is an achievement for beating 30 quests with the last character you recruit for your party.  In order to get this achievement, you need to actively avoid completing any quests for most of the game and then come back to them after beating the main boss.  This is a bit anticlimactic.  If you don't worry about this achievement, it's not a problem, however.  Other than that, it's an excellent RPG that's well worth your time.   If you're on the fence about this game, there's a free demo from Aldorlea's website that lets you play the full game for an hour to see if you like it.\nI hope this review gets you excited to try the Millennium saga!\n","January 8, 2015","true","30.7"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","24","26","2","0"

The combination of a strong story, well written characters and addicting gameplay grew quickly on me.\n\nThanks to the different difficulties, visible / invisible monsters option and guiding arrows the game is well accessible to beginners. The in-game tutorial helps, too. Actually, this is probably one of the biggest strength of these games - no complicated installation, no shortcuts learning, you just start it and play immediately. At the same time, it offers quite a lot of challenge. The battles are classical, i.e. turn-based. But since action order is affected by characters' stats and these changes with difficulty, the battles play quite differently in different modes. In the Hard mode, you really need to know what you are doing and to use spells and equipment to your advantage. Usually, the stuff found in secret rooms and optional areas is very handy.\nOverall, the tuning is very good and the game rewards you well for knowledge and exploration. If you feel a need for "grinding" you are doing something wrong. Plus, levels and money only transfer to Millennium 2 up to a certain limit, so the game doesn't force you to spend too much time levelling.\n\nSpeaking of exploration, there are many well hidden secret rooms and some other special things to find. Quests are various, some of them are even "chained", i.e. missing the first one means missing all the subsequent quests. Some players will probably find it too "hardcore", but I like the challenge. Maps are well thought out, with lot of optional areas and stuff to find. Once again, exploration pays off in Millennium.\nAnother important part of the gameplay is jumping. In some parts the game plays a bit like a platformer and you can jump over rocks, chasms and so on. With a special equipment you can even reach otherwise inaccessible areas and that's where the real fun begins.\n\nCharacters are well written and lifelike, with Marine "stealing the show". She's just so passionate and stuborn. Quite the opposite of Benoit, which ensures quite a few hilarious dialogues. Visuals and music are also of high standards. Especially the artworks are beatiful. To sum it up - I certainly recommend Millennium. It's a great game, and it's also the first part of great series. In other words, a good game to start with...","April 29, 2014","true","8.4"," 31 of 45 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","31","45","0","0"

Their strenghts and skills are very diverse and it's fun finding out how to use them best and what they can do.\nAlso in their personalities the characters are very different, which is typical for Aldorlea games. Each one of them is special and I loved reading the dialogues between them.\nThe gameplay is very well balanced. You can choose the difficulty mode that suits you best, and an "ordinary" player like me can do perfectly on normal mode. Fighting in that mode isn't too easy so that one would get bored, but also not annoyingly hard, and grinding isn't necessary at all, which is something that I appreciate.\nBeing granted the choice whether to play with visible or invisible encounters is a great feature too and increases the replay value a lot in my opinion.\nWhat's typical for Aldorlea games as well is the big variety of equipment. You often find great stuff in secret rooms, but also get to buy good things. It's so much fun to find new weapons and enjoy seeing the difference they make in fights, as well as other special accessories.\nA big (albeit totally optional) part of the game is finding secret rooms. I love and hate them. It's always satisfying to find one, but it can become just as frustrating when missing one or more.\nThere are also a lot of side quests to do, some easy, some quite tricky. So this is a game where you shouldn't just rush trhough, but take your time and explore thoroughly. Then it's fun to figure out how to solve those quests.\nAs for visuals, I find the maps very appealing and beautiful. What's special in MM is that there are maps where you can only walk left and right and jump up and down to other platforms. I like that, it's different from common maps. Also you do a lot of crazy jumps to reach places, that's awesome.\nThe character artworks are probably the most beautiful of all Aldorlea games, they are simply amazing.\nThe music too is wonderful for the most part, at least to my taste.\n\nAll in all I very much recommend this game to all people who love old school RPGs and are not biased against RPG Maker games.\n","November 12, 2014","true","16.9"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","0"

I got a lot of time out of it and I actually had fun. While the story is your run of the mill "be the hero and do the good thing" story its still nice. One of my favorite details is gold is sparse because bears and ants dont have coin purses, so you have to sell the loot from killing ♥♥♥♥ to get money. My real complaint is how limited it is. If this wasnt limited to the RPG maker engine it could be so visually wonderful and there could be a lot more going on with the world. Overall its 10 hours of game for 6 dollars.

The game is challenging and with a nice story backdrop. This is the first part of a several part game series. The game can be played in different difficulty settings and it might be reasonable not to run it for the first time on hard level.\n\nEven if you are not into RPG Maker created games this one is one of the great jewels of the RPG Maker games with some difficulties, challenges and a lot to discover. Some hints for having a great delight during the game:\n\nSearch every barrell, crack, box or sometimes even prominent lying stones, beds and cabinets there is a lot of stuff hidden around.Don't sell yet all of the "treasure" stuff, you'll be needing it in a latter game as money resource.Try to get Expertises early for your characters look at the strengths in status and train them up first!Don't be thrifty with baskets, orbs and other stuff that might help your party later, by the way in the later games your parties level will be demoted again - so don't put too much time into running through all the levels.\n\nPro:Nice story and good backdrop, you'll really might get set up with all those high and mighty type of people in Mystrock.\nGreat and complex game created with a tool that has some restrictions.\nNice customized sound and artworks.\nCon:Might get too much because of some naivity issues of the heroes. But that is a minor thing... this game was created to catch this kind of style, so it's not really a con - just saying.\nI recommend this game.\nIt might not be perfect, but it's a good waste of time anyway. Watching Marine, Benoit and their friends grow is fun. Finding stuff in unexpected places, sometimes really powerful tools in chests that are hidden in places which are easily overlooked. This game actually is promoting exploration, and searching - you'll find a lot of freebies that will help you along during the game.","August 21, 2015","true","89.8"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

The battles are horribly slow unless you turn on a menu option to increase the speed of the animations to 150%.\n\nIt seems neither Marine nor Benoit have enough useful skills to properly combat enemies. The most useful skill Marine has is "Call Jeanne" which summons a fairy like creature that can attack multiple enemies and heal to great effect. This in theory could overpower a player if it weren't possible for enemies to kill a character before you can summon the fairy and give it a command. I often found myself summoning it using it to heal twice then letting it attack. Some enemies are also totally immune to it's attack (I just used to to heal in those instances).\n\nItems, gold, and even the use of skills is at a premium here. You have to be extremely careful not to run out of healing items, revival items, and SP (Magic) restorative items.\nThis situation is exasperated by the lack of gold to buy such items with and the limited areas provided to restore health and SP. I swear when I started this game it took me FOREVER to get to an area with a bed that let you "free-style sleep" to fully restore. When I found one it was located fairly deep in a town and was real annoying to get back to between grinding. (I've stricken something here because healing items are actually a bit more prevalent if you use the monster meats dropped to heal).\n\nSAVE OFTEN is something you hear sometimes with rpg's this game takes that to another level. I'd recommend saving every 10 steps pretty much and running away from many battles.\n\nEvery time you get a game over the game displays a screen that has an old mans face on it and the text "You need to try harder".\nEat me game.\n\nSteam overlay doesn't work. Screenshots don't work with F12. (At least F12 only pauses the game here I've seen some Rpg Maker titles bind it to load last save or reset).\n\nI used an Xbox360 controller to play. The D-Pad does not work and the analog is far to sensitive while navigating the menu. This is an rpg, the D-Pad should work.\n\nI've actually fallen asleep 3 times playing this game. I'm not critical enough to simply call it boring, but I might say it's pretty boiler plate as far as rpg's go. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone else.

This is one that fans of this sort of game absolutely must play, and if you happen to be unfamiliar with this type of game (or Aldorlea's games), it would be a great introduction to a particular style of rpg (Aldorlea's) that is unmatched.\n\nLots of choices get you going and capture your interest immediately.

One of the reaons I like and follow Aldorlea is that they are pretty good at making games that will give your money's worth and this is no exception. Millenium is a solid tale with an interesting main plot and a lot of sidequests for the wanderer. I think the sidequests are a bit too difficult sometimes, though. And I still prefer the stand-alone RPG overall, but the contents and good production values of this title manage to make up for it. 8/10.","May 9, 2015","true","10.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The feeling at start is nice. You find after many barrels little helps. The starts make fun, many are on the fields working many things to get on the first 5 maps and still need to come back later for later you can even found your first of 24 secret maps if you are lucky or test every corner. Then it go the wide world. Some ways are in the first game not avaible not even for a little sneak how hard it gets there or just take a preview look but its fine, its enough to explore and find on the first map (one of the 8 animal kings (i think everytime on the Manga Toriko only that few have secret incredince) or 2 other well hidden stuff.  So there is many to find in the game, for beginners are there green arrows and you can make the most enemys visible. There are many items to find what i like even if there could some be a bit better and more change from other weapons, most there are only chaning 2-3 basics and only few but its okay you can find other things that make you stronger (items, orbs, pillars, techniques) you only need the money and the right ways to find. Money you get only few in mid and end game, thats relastic but sad, little bandits in some early areas would be not so bad. The guide of the game is great but could have some more details like all items with little numbers and what there to get or ingame a map/ compass that shows you if you have 100 % of the map reached, but that is only low critic points. What i dont like was in some fights you cant escape you cant load save games or get in the menue, but thats really still not important points. The game is great, you need to collect a group of warrior and start here to get the first 3 of them, it feels like King Arthur collects his mens for his table. The main game is not so long if you go straight forward but its a challenge on all modes at the end even if you find all 22 of 24 usefull secret rooms, many orbs, good weapons and co or increase the levels of your techniques. There could be a bit more story about the people but i love it enough, there could sometimes in the rookies more animals/ life or some more details and other places too or rooms where only 1-2 be in but that no one interest for real. I am happy to start with the 2nd of 5 parts in some days. The comic is short but nice work and the wallpapers are a nice gimmick too where you see the work for little details. The developer is friendly and helpful if you have requests about what to do, where to get important stuff or which items/ways are useful and which enemys are better to handle and he is still there for changing parts to make the game better. Give the game a chance. The enemys are fine, many things like blending, bleeding and nice different enemy types, even if there could be some more :) Enjoy some hours, find the incredible hidden items, finish the 40 quests and be one part of 13 warriors against the rich and unsocial Lord Dragon and his followers. I personally give this game 9.5 of 10.0 points for me. Look a lets play maybe you have interest to invest 10+ hours to find many things and beat/complete the game!","October 19, 2015","true","24.3"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","4"

It's pretty much exactly on the edge...\n\nPro:\n- The graphics (for an RPG Maker game) and music are good.\n- You can select how the random battles are handled and if 'quest markers' should be displayed.\n- There are a lot of exploration rewards that aren't generic healing items/gold.\n\nContra:\n- The story is poor. There's not one interesting NPC in the whole game. The main 'conflict' isn't engaging at all.\n- The dungeons are dragged out way too much. It feels like the designers decided to make the game longer simply by creating lots and lots of meaningless (and empty) maps.\n- The dialog feels very padded by companion comments. There might have been a chance to give them more depth, but that chance wasn't used.\n- The side quests are cryptic and feel very random. Same goes for finding the secrets.\n\nIt's not a horrible game at all, but it fails to leave a good impression after my play through. The game isn't challenging (except for the animal kings) and the boss fights all follow the same boring tactic. If this game wants to be an 'old-school RPG' it didn't do its homework very well.\n\nIf you have played a lot of JRPGs and love them, this game will be not a total waste of time, but there are much better games in the genre out there.

There are so many great features to this game so i'll break it down a little bit.\n\nGraphics -\n\nGreat use of space on the maps, Aldorlea didn't just plonk everything down randomly , some real thought has gone into the placement and planing of maps, the towns give a great feeling of size and depth. A big mistake lots of RPG's make is to make a village in the middle of no where and set every house 3 feet from their neightbour, while convienient for the player it's not realistic. Millennium rarely makes this mistake.\n\nThe character art is amazing, I love the style and that they have steered clear of the standard anime-esk facesets that lots RPG games of late have been using.\n\nSound -\n\nThe music is great too! I don't usually enjoy the soundtrack when I'm playing an Indie RPG is all seems the same, Millenium has really done well with it's music. I'm not sure if it was custom made for the game or not, but i've played so many RPG's and I havnt heard it before.\n\nGameplay\n\nI think having mouse support is something that more RPGs should be using, When you're relaxing with a new game and it's getting late no one likes to be huddled over their keyboard getting hand cramps :P\n\nThe comat is well balanced, and being able to call a fairy for heal and deal damage for you during combat is a great idea I havn't seen before.\n\nThe interation between player and NPC's is really well written, I didn't get an urge to just pound the keyboard / mouse to skip the NPC dialog, It was really enjoyable to read.\n\nStory\n\nWithout giving away the story for anyone who is about to start playing, All I will say is Awesome! you will not be disapointed.\n\n\nNow I can't throw all this Positive at you without giving you a critisism\n\nThe mouse pathfinding isn't great!\n\nthats it, that's the negitive. :D\n\n","October 21, 2015","true","25.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Story is rather simple and naive: there are two coexisting places - powerful, rich kingdom and very poor village, that suffers from crop failure, which may cause dead by starvation to many of its residents. Is it realistic? Not really, it's typical fairy tale. Story never explains how the kingdom is so rich and from where they take food supplies (since, apparently, not from village, because they don't care about poor harvest).\n\nThe protagonist is a teenage girl, who try to change the whole system. She want to run in the elections, but she know, she wouldn't win standard way, so she decide to use other rule - she want to challenge the best warriors from kingdom. To do that, she herself need to collect a team of powerful friends.\n\nYou can control your character via mouse or by just keyboard - I decided to go with the second option (since it felt more organic), but it has caused me problems few times - I could not get in to certain locations or collect items that were right before me. You have map with the most important places. First few locations are rather simple and easy to navigate, though the later ones are far to complicated and disorienting. If I hadn't use a little help and activate arrows that may guide you (which is kind of a cheat, I guess), there were few important things that I would never find otherwise. Combat is not well balanced - in most of fights you don't even need to use your special skills to win. It's bad because there are few more challenging fights at the end of the game and if you hadn't experiment with your skills before, you may miserably fail.\n\nPros:\n+ very good graphic\n+ interesting characters\n+ a lot of locations\n+ nice music\n+ leaves you curious about the next part\n\nCons:\n- combat is not well balanced\n- keyboard controls does not always work well\n- it's very hard to find yourself in bigger and more complicated locations (even if you have arrows to guide you). If you need to go back for something, it will be ages before you find yourself\n- combat isn't rewarding - you don't get many special items and if you suddenly find yourself in the last location with the final boss and you did not have money to get prepare or you just didn't buy enough things... Well, you're pretty much scr*wed, since going back is really a pain.","May 18, 2015","true","15.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Story is rather simple and naive: there are two coexisting places - powerful, rich kingdom and very poor village, that suffers from crop failure, which may cause dead by starvation to many of its residents. Is it realistic? Not really, it's typical fairy tale. Story never explains how the kingdom is so rich and from where they take food supplies (since, apparently, not from village, because they don't care about poor harvest).\n\nThe protagonist is a teenage girl, who try to change the whole system. She want to run in the elections, but she know, she wouldn't win standard way, so she decide to use other rule - she want to challenge the best warriors from kingdom. To do that, she herself need to collect a team of powerful friends.\n\nYou can control your character via mouse or by just keyboard - I decided to go with the second option (since it felt more organic), but it has caused me problems few times - I could not get in to certain locations or collect items that were right before me. You have map with the most important places. First few locations are rather simple and easy to navigate, though the later ones are far to complicated and disorienting. If I hadn't use a little help and activate arrows that may guide you (which is kind of a cheat, I guess), there were few important things that I would never find otherwise. Combat is not well balanced - in most of fights you don't even need to use your special skills to win. It's bad because there are few more challenging fights at the end of the game and if you hadn't experiment with your skills before, you may miserably fail.\n\nPros:\n+ very good graphic\n+ interesting characters\n+ a lot of locations\n+ nice music\n+ leaves you curious about the next part\n\nCons:\n- combat is not well balanced\n- keyboard controls does not always work well\n- it's very hard to find yourself in bigger and more complicated locations (even if you have arrows to guide you). If you need to go back for something, it will be ages before you find yourself\n- combat isn't rewarding - you don't get many special items and if you suddenly find yourself in the last location with the final boss and you did not have money to get prepare or you just didn't buy enough things... Well, you're pretty much scr*wed, since going back is really a pain.","May 18, 2015","true","15.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But, there were a couple of negatives that did.\n- Uneven difficulty. I kept fluctuating between being too overpowered and being too weak.\n[This was entirely due to one area in which you had to traverse through twice, this area inflicted a status ailment on your entire party in every battle. This ailment caused reduced accuracy (and among other things, but the accuracy was the most notable) which made battles infuriating and tedious.

It's very bad and most of it is from the main character. Ugh.\n\nUnless you're a hardcore fan of RPGMaker RPG's, I'd suggest avoiding this one.\n[If you do enjoy these kinds of games, I do think it will scratch enough of your itch.]\n\n[Edited to elaborate on a couple of points and fixed a couple of words.]","February 1, 2015","false","14.8"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

I got this game on sale, it's been a while since I've gotten lost in an RPG, so why not, right?\n\nCertainly, this is no Dragon Age, but I didn't need it to be. The art style looks closer to Chrono Trigger, which is why I originally picked it up, and for the most part, it kinda is, though I haven't actually played CT all the way through, I'm fairly certain that it also doesn't have actually photographs providing backgrounds for 16 bit foreground scenery... it's a little jaring...\n\nI'm only 8 hours into the game, which may or may not be half way, depending on who you talk to. At my rate of progression I'm probably only like 3% done, but I've managed to do 8 quests, only one of which appears to actually be putting my toward my final goal.\n\nMy biggest problem is dying. I'm not sure how the system works but sometimes I die and I go back to the menu, the helpful old man on the screen tells me I need to try harder. Thanks. Othertimes it lets me keep playing right where I left off at the cost of 10% of my gold. I don't get a choice in the matter, it just happens. I mean, I like the fact that I can keep going from where I left off, because traveling through the world is a nightmare and a half, but that's also why I'm saving every few minutes, so honestly, I'd rather just not lose the 10% of my gold. I'm sure there is a reason, it's just not clear for it.\n\nThe battles ossilate between way too difficult and way too hard. Some encounters I don't have any issues, some get my KOed pretty quickly. Same baddies. I found out that the dragons hate the black orb, had a cut scene leading up to a mini-boss? Which I took out in a single move. Spoiler alert. I guess.\n\nI do like the artwork, I mean the character drawings are fun, even if they appear over top the enemies I'm fighting so I don't know how many there are. The game also does a great job of not letting me go where I'm not suppose to go, unless it's into battle in a location I'm not suppose to be where suddenly I'm just totally KOed without warning.\n\nYes, I am writing this after giving up and dropping my controller to the floor. To be fair, I died three times in a location I'm going through because I have no healing supplies, and I'm far enough in that I don't know whether it's worth heading back or not, but the enemeies all do enough damage that you have to heal after every battle or die... oh, wait, I'm dying anyway.\n\nI don't understand why some stuff costs SP and other stuff doesn't... when the other stuff is limited on how many times you can use it. This was a fun little distraction lately, but there's so many little nuances and hidden secrets I have a feeling that I'm not going to make much of an effor to finish the game at this point.","January 31, 2015","false","7.3"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","0"

That said, if you enjoy the old RPG games from SNES era you may enjoy this game. One can tell, that the creator has put some work into this. However, it is, in my opinion, just not enough work to justify a price of 6,00 €.\nThe story is nice but nothing too special. One of those "let's go out and save the world". Although I actually liked the idea that the main hero wants to make the world a better place to live in instead of rescueing it from some kind of doom. What broke the hole atmosphere for me, was the main character repeatedly breaking the fourth wall each time when she says that she just has accomplished another quest accompanied with some stupid applause.\nAlso the music does not really help to maintain atmosphere. At first it seems quite well chosen but it gets repetitive very quickly even to a point where you just cannot listen to it any more. This is very sad, as the choice of music is one of the most important thing for this kind game.\nAlso destroying any credibility is the main characters jumping skills. At times she would jump off or on cliffs in the mountains where normally living beings would just break every single bone. Not to speak of her wall jumping skills with lava right beneath her. Keep in mind at this point that your main character is a teenage girl who had never really left her home village.\nWhat also has been a huge drawback for me were the dungeons. At first, these seemd to be very well planned. They are kind of big with a lot of ways and things to discover. However this gets rather tedious in later dungeons, as the treasure only repeat themselves and the enemies get more and more status changing attacks which quite often can only be healed with the specific item which can definitley never been found in the dungeon where you need it the most.\nSo, after a while you find yourself hoping to find the quickest way through the dungeon and not discovering, as there are almost no real interesting things to be found and the normally quite easy ennemies are too strong all of a sudden because you cannot cure your status changes.\nThere still are many things to do in this game (quests and secret rooms) but your main way of getting XP to level up is monster grinding. Which, although it works 'on the fly' as the dungeons are so big and labyrinth like is tedious as already described and in my opinion a bad choice for a game design. The most entertaining and rewarding way to level up you char is always a mix of quests and monster slaying.\n\nThis all said, I want to stress again that this game is not worth it's price. There are many other games out there, created with the RPG Maker which are completely free to play and which designed far better. Just to mention three: "Unterwegs in Düsterburg" and "Vampires Dawn 1" and "Vampires Dawn 2". Although all of them are, as far as I know only in German. However, all of these are better than this one here and do not cost anything!\n\nI'd like to say 'though that it seems that Millennium - A New Hope seems to be the first game of a series. So, the creator has probably learned from mistakes and might have changed things in it's sequels. And should I find them for free (legally) or as a bargain anywhere I might give them a try.","May 10, 2014","false","8.2"," 23 of 49 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","23","49","0","0"

Marina was annoying, and Benoit was absurd. I don't know about any of the other characters, because I honestly didn't bother to play that long. The dialogue alone was enough to make my eyes want to bleed.\n\nThis game has all the makings of a classically annoying RPG: a soundtrack that drives you nuts (seriously, why are women vocalizing together in the beginning town stages???), enemies and bosses that have some obnoxiously overpowered attacks even on normal and easy modes (oh, you can paralyze, bleed, and blind me? That's cute; thanks for that), and a story that failed to capture my interest even in the smallest measure.\n\nAs for the grinding and battling, it left a lot to be desired. Enemies can wail on you 'til kingdom come, and you don't get a lot of gold to get healing items or characters with high enough SP to afford to continously heal more than 3 or 4 times. Even with the items you find or occasional rest area, it's not enough unless you want to spend all your items on healing instead of armor and weapons.

It is the first episode of a 5 episode series and feels that way - the story is just an introduction and some adventuring to get the starting few companions.  Which is all well and good, but it is padded out into a 15-20 hour game through humongous maps, and you still don't feel like you've accomplished much towards the end. Wasn't a fan of the story either, but that's far more subjective.  I have a feeling I'm just not part of the target demographic or something.\n\nIt doesn't help that items required to complete many of the side quests can only be acquired by going to one hidden location at the right point in progression through the story.  If you find the location too late, or don't visit it enough, you'll end up finishing the game with uncompleted side-quests in your log.\n\nI did like being able to see enemies in dungeons instead of having random encounters every couple steps that can be annoying in some JRPGs.\n\nI haven't played Millennium 2 yet, so perhaps the series improves greatly from part 1, but A New Hope didn't leave me with much desire to continue to the next one (not with my backlog, lol.)

There's some town where rich people live, you're sent to deliver something while your dad is injured - a fairy falls into your earrings and instead of returning home to your sick/dying father you decide to compete in this town's elections...? I just didn't get what was happening.\n- Battle system is boring as hell. I mean, sure it's the default - but it feels like next to no thought was put into battling/skill use etc.\n\nThere are lots of RPGMaker-based games that deliver an amazing experience - this just isn't one of them.","January 6","false","0.6"," 1 of 13 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","13","0","0"

Graphics are the same as every other game made with the same tools, music is amateurish and the combat is laughable. You get the monsters standing in front of you - twitching to imply they're attacking. Your party members are presented as avatars and are not otherwise visible. A fantastic game to get 3 cards from and then to delete it with passion.\n\nWhile writing this review I noticed there's a limit that you have to play the game at least 5 minutes before posting a review so I'll waith for the first card before pushing the "Post review" -button.","May 12, 2014","false","0.9"," 8 of 42 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","8","42","0","1"
