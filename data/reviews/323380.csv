"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigglesbringsdanoize/recommended/323380/","bigglesbringsdanoize","Biggles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigglesbringsdanoize/","508 products in account","A few years ago, a little title came out called Antichamber. I played it to what I guess you'd consider 100% completion in a few afternoons over a long weekend, and said to myself, "this eliminates all doubt, new genres of game still exist to be uncovered if developers bother to look."\n\nThe better part of a year later, a game called The Stanley Parable came out. I had very much the same thoughts about it.\n\nSomewhere in there, The Swapper released.\n\nThe pattern here, I guess, if there is one, is that the most imaginitive stuff coming out lately seems to have been on the puzzle game front. I tend to think of those three titles as such - Antichamber is built around its own weird school of bizarro-logic, and The Stanley Parable contained enough endings and possibilities that I found myself drawing a flowchart. That's puzzle enough for me. The Swapper, possibly the most traditional puzzle game among the three, was still freaking weird, still engaged on some sort of intellectual level, and still was a great deal more captivating than most titles I played its year of release.\n\nWhy would I bother to preface this review with a comparison to those three games? Well, I tend to think that The Magic Circle can happily co-exist alongside them. While a bit rougher around the edges than those titles, it shares the same ridiculous sense that it's out to tread a sort of new ground, and doesn't really care if the player wants to go along with it. People expecting a core puzzle game aren't likely to exactly get their fix here. This is a confident game, very much its own beast.\n\nThat's okay by me. The Magic Circle isn't a terribly challenging puzzle game, but it's built around a rather novel idea - you're here, essentially, to further break an already-broken piece of software. Certain items in the world are entirely rewritable, their behaviors yours to define. This is the means by which you progress in the small-but-concise game world.\n\nThe programmer in me is hooked on the concept from square one. Visual touches like bits of code flying around the screen as you interact with the game's editable objects (I confess getting a weird satisfaction from reading them and trying to suss out where they'd go in the game's engine), placeholder textures, and so on help to ground the idea that while the world around you essentially functions, you're effectively playing as code in a hapless machine.\n\nThe world is packed with nooks and crannies where the in-game game's "developers" (read: antagonists) have left change logs, notes to each other, and audio recordings. For the most part, it's reasonably well-written, even. I didn't outright laugh at anything to be found here, but I smirked. And that's really the game's intended effect, I think. If you've followed any vaporware story, any failed Kickstarter project, in the past few years, The Magic Circle has a few choice words of cynical sympathy for you.\n\nSadly, a couple of awkward dialogue choices, particularly in the early game, stand out for that reason. I cringed at a handful of one character's monologues. I appreciate that the game is trying to make a particular character come off as downright weird and unlikeable, but it doesn't change the effect - there were scenes of melodrama I had to force myself not to skip from sheer embarrassment. Intended by the developers or not, it's not exactly pleasant to sit through.\n\nThere's another thing I wish to address, and that's that the game stands in a weird Twilight Zone. I encountered a lot of visual bugs, frequent missing textures, and a significant amount of pop-in in my five hours with the game. I am not sure if this was intentional (that's how effective this game is as a satirical work), but it did make exploration more difficult than it needed to be at times. Given the labyrinthine design of the overworld map, I found myself relying on visual landmarks for navigation, and it did get in the way when I'd have to wait for one to pop back in.\n\nI like to get the negative out of the way in reviews though so I can refocus in on what a game does well. A very effective final 20 minutes and ending, some frankly ingenious multi-solution (if perhaps a tad easy) puzzles, and a visual style that consistently surprises make this game the first real standout for those looking for a unique experience in 2015.\n\n--UPDATE (7/16)--\n\nI wasn't expecting this review to get so popular. I posted it, looked away, and to my surprise, it's sitting on the storefront. Because it's there, and I happen to be in control of it, I think a nice little thing to do might be for me to answer any user questions below, since other people who click on this might have them.\n\n\nmendel asked:\nDo you know Doublefine's Hack'n'Slash where you reprogram the game in order to progress? Is TMC more than HnS in 3D with a different backstory?\n\nI've not actually played HnS. I followed its development a bit, but Double Fine lost a bit of my personal confidence with the whole Kickstarter, failed project, Kickstarter, Early Access, conga line they started to, shall we say, dance in. So.. take the following answer with a grain of salt.\n\nTMC does not go as far as Hack'n'Slash in its "hacking". By no means do you interact directly with the code you're manipulating in the game. A better way to think about TMC's approach to hacking might be "you can equip items on objects in the game world".\n\nFor instance, say I'm being attacked by a spooky ghost. I might, in TMC, replace his ability to fly with the limitation that he may only walk. That might be a way I can avoid him.\n\nHack'n'Slash, by comparison, looks more geared towards actual programmers. (in fact, I'm a little tempted to go play with the demo if there is one)\n\nOne thing I would point out, if you're unsure, is that TMC does have a gameplay demo that lets you see the first hour or so of gameplay. It's what sold me on a purchase.\n\nHope that helps!","July 12, 2015","true","5.8"," 349 of 368 people (95%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","95","349","368","14","9"

Said dev is voiced by the dude who voices Rusty Venture so it adds even more to the delusional mega ego. Overall manipulating and exploring the world is fun and the game is tight enough where it doesn't get old. The writing and voice acting are both good stuff and it ends up being a fun satire of diva devs, crazy fans, and bloated games destroyed by their own unfeasibly lofty ambitions.

I'm really split as to whether I should recommend it or not.\n\nOn the one hand, it does have a very nice story and I found it addictive (while it lasted), and reminds of Portal in that regard. The voice acting is brilliant and [SPOILER ALERT] the different levels of reality it throws at you [\SPOILER ALERT] is refreshing.\n\nHowever, it lacks puzzles or challenges. It lacks much of a world to explore. I simply don't expect to be able to finish a game in 4 hours, not when it costs £13/$20. There is the option to 'level up' in the game, but its simply unnecessary. You can do everything by just walking without thought and pressing buttons as they come up (I got 90% of the hidden messages this way).\n\nThe game has lots of options for creative solutions, but these are not needed as there are basically no problems to be solved. Which I think is the dissapointing thing about this game.\n\nTo summarise, the game feels like a short, odd sci-fi/fantasy book. The story keeps you going, and when you finally put it down you feel slightly uneasy about what's just happened. Unfortunately, I don't think that's quite enough for me to recommend it as a game.","July 9, 2015","false","5.8"," 207 of 287 people (72%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","72","207","287","12","6"

The premise is that you are in an unfinished game and have limited abilities to edit the game as you travel through it.  The integration between the game mechanics and the story make this exceptionally engaging.  There are a bunch of fourth wall jokes and gameplay is fairly non-linear/open-world.  You can reach the end of the game fairly quickly (about 5 hours) but there are many side/easter egg things that encourage you to go back and discover afterwards (or before).  I highly recommend this to people who enjoyed Portal 2 (not that it's SUPER similar, but the blend of puzzle and comedy is somewhat reminicent).\nYour progress in the demo will carry over into the full game.  I've done an LP here but encourage you to play the game yourself before watching the end. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL5JEFvVpx9rBFMQ-7YygNarrBXUBwY1A","September 16, 2015","true","3.7"," 39 of 40 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","39","40","3","0"

The project director seems out of touch with the people he works with, as their conversations break down into drama and backstabbing, with no consensus on what the game should be. The project has become the most important thing in his life, but he can’t decide on what it’s supposed to be. Over the long development a part of the game seems to have gained sentience, and wants you the player to take over and finish the game yourself.\n\nYou explore an unfinished world, full of half done or abandoned designs, reaching back to the early 90s. The older designs look like System Shock 1, while the new one is a fantasy adventure. You solve puzzles by capturing creatures and objects, and modifying their properties. Even though the game is broken, your method of interacting with it is quite nice! This game was made by Jordan Thomas, best known for making The Cradle in Thief 3, Fort Frolic in Bioshock, and then as Creative Designer on Bioshock 2. By now he knows how to make a game, and The Magic Circle feels like a game made by an expert. There’s no newbie design mistakes, and the game does all it can to make the experience as smooth as possible, without sacrificing complexity. There’s often several solutions to puzzles, so you’re unlikely to get stuck anywhere.\n\nTo make a game as meta as this requires the developers be smarty pants. And so they were, invoking authenticity in all the dialog and notes you come across. The references in the game clearly come from Looking Glass, Irrational Games, Ion Storm, and Origin. The closest comparison to this would be The Stanley Parable and Portal 2, but it’s more ambitious than either of them. It only dawned on me after I’d finished it just how much this games does, and how well it succeeds in all it tries to do. If you like to read behind the scenes stuff about game development, The Magic Circle will be a treat.","July 19, 2015","true","3.8"," 26 of 26 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","26","26","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StriderSprite/recommended/323380/","StriderSprite","Your Local Village Magician","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StriderSprite/","136 products in account","The Magic Circle... what do I say. It's clear the developers are trying to say something with it, but I'm not sure they themselves know what it's supposed to be saying.\n\nI'm quite sure I was supposed to have some revelation about video games like Spec Ops or The Stanley Parable. But while those games played all up and down the scales of meta, questioning and prodding the relationship between the player and the game, as soon as The Magic Circle grasped onto a point about anything, it slipped and fell off, eventually ending so far down the "CAN YOU TELL THIS IS SATIRE YET?" hole: in the second half of the game, you are required sabotage an entirely faked demo for "E4", the massive gaming convention (yes). It feels less like a story about video game development and more like pent-up retribution the team was directing at their former employers. It struck me as immature.\n\nThe characters are all just awful people. Its few attempts at trying to cause sympathy are, well, I'm just going to say it, creepy. One of the characters announces that they're sterile. There's mentions of orgies in the woods at sex castle dungeons. It is extremely creepy and forced and trying way too hard for the Video Games Are Art award. Everybody is bitter and angry and hostile and sarcastic. There was no part where anybody smiled, or laughed, or seemed in any way pleased about anything.\n\nBut I'm giving the game a thumbs up. Why? The parts and the narrative about the struggles about video game development rung true. The mechanics of undeleting and editing characters, to having lordes of pets, to the puzzle solving, were ultimately fun. Climbing to places I'm not "supposed" to go to find easter eggs feels rewarding. The game developers know that I'm going to explore every nook and cranny, and they make it worthwhile. There are stories and lore littered around which perhaps give a glimmer of insight, however surface, into the choices and problems that face video games.\n\nThe game was at its best when it showed people genuinely trying to make a *good* video game, rather than simply get paid, or get out of a wretched contract, or get revenge on the designer (which, spoilers, are the three goals of the main characters at the end).\n\nThe developers also knew that making a game about an unfinished prototype is a slippery slope -- it requires a certain kind of "not polish" that needs to seem intentional, rather than lazy. They pulled this off super well. The art style is "placeholder textures", but when you get near objects, they spring into color and life, showing that yes, they can draw things for real. Some feel like they're out of a freeware game -- unaligned pieces of Arial text and boring controls, but when you go "behind the scenes" and rewrite the game's mechanics, it feels like a really well-done hacker movie, with snippets of code zooming past you. This is a trick that's hard to pull off, and these guys did it.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that although first-person, you never hold any gun. It's about puzzles, interaction, and exploration, which is always refreshing to see.\n\nSo yes, is it a good game? No. Not by a long-shot. Is it worth your time, and do I recommend you play it? Yes. At least up until you kill the Sky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.","July 13, 2015","true","4.8"," 47 of 61 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","47","61","5","1"

Those games with a deep meaning and a stated purpose, using a virtual world as their canvas. Titles like The Walking Dead or Braid, they want you to feel something first and foremost, at the expense of everything else. The Magic Circle also has a meaning to impart on the player, but I’m not sure if it came first. It’s a game that innovates with both its mechanics and storytelling, bringing the players in and having a nasty conversation with them. It’s a game about the people who play games and the people who design them, which understandably isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. Give it a chance though, and its broken world will enchant you in a way that few others will.

Exploration is very rewarding in this game.  There are plenty of references, and the game starts off instantly fun, with easy to learn controls.  The narrative and game mechanics work very well with the art style, and the game is able to take itself serious while still adding plenty of humor at the same time.  In my opinion as a fan of sci-fi and fantasy open world rpgs, MMORPGs, and a student character modeler this is easily one of the best games of 2015.","May 14, 2015","true","10.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","16","18","2","0"

It emphasizes exploration more than puzzles or combat, but I think it’s somewhere in that range. Very refreshing and very worth your time.\n\nI’d been excited to play this because of Jordan Thomas’s involvement (Shalebridge Cradle, Fort Frolic), but otherwise didn’t know what to expect.\n\nThe first surprise is that it’s the funniest game he’s worked on. The narrative is mostly delivered by overhearing conversations, sort of a comedy radio play. The characters are exaggerated blends of some well-known developers (Richard “Lord British” Garriott, John Romero, Warren Spector, Stevie Case, etc.). Some characters talk directly to you, but since you are involved in the fiction as a ‘player’ it frequently makes jokes as it breaks the 4th wall. The world contains a huge number visual gags about unfinished/buggy/cliché games and these are funny as long as you’ve looked at a level editor or bad game even once. There’s also text logs that poke fun at the petty disagreements that happen when developing a game.\n\nThe second surprise (though more in tune with Jordan’s other work) is that it’s really creepy. Everything in the game’s presentation is trying to unsettle you. The world looks like it’s barely held together and every action you take looks breaks the world just a little more, almost to the point of snapping in two. There’s layers of subtext anywhere you look and it’s like snooping in someone’s trash. The motivations and origins of characters are mysterious enough to draw you in and push your comfort level as you voyeuristically hear their interactions.\n\nThe third surprise is the actual gameplay. It’s hard to tell if this is a FPS, RPG, or what from the trailer (or even the first hour of play). It finally hit me that the easiest description is that it’s a necromancer game with some light puzzle elements. It’s presented as an open world, but some directions are blocked off until you find a decent combination of ‘spells’ to open up a new path. The necromancy also plays into the creepiness since your army of the undead is kind of a loud menace that won’t give you personal space.\n\nThe final section of the game goes in some crazy directions with story and gameplay. It’s a little too much to take in as one big chunk, but it’s also a great climax that makes the game feel complete. It’s a nice self-contained story and I can’t fault for being a bit meta or navel gazing when it’s so unlike anything else I’ve played before.","May 17, 2015","true","5.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

There is some good light platforming, back tracking Metroidvania style, and a lot of side things to discover. Just finished it up in about 6 hours. I was shocked when I reached the second part of the game. Like an added bonus to an already good game. Well worth $2.80 per hour. You'd spend at least twice that at the theater.

There are so many things that need to be considered from cost of development to marketing. Throw in some ego and human error and things can get really messy. So messy in fact that in The Magic Circle, the game decides to turn against its creators, with your help of course. With the ability to hack into the games code and other useful tools given to you from an old pro, you will start a twisted journey to take the power from the powers that be. Perhaps more importantly find out who they are. The Magic Circle is a somewhat of a linear story, it isn't super difficult and the puzzles are rather light. What the game does boast is quite the atmosphere, everything can change in the blink of an eye and usually does. The entire game is also somewhat satirical and humorous, poking fun at game design and developers. Hacking into objects and bending the rules is entertaining but nothing that is seriously complicated or strategic. It's just fun. I would've loved to see this expanded on more but the story is front and center here. I would say that The Magic Circle falls under the walking simulator genre, not that I feel that is a bad thing and mean this in no harmful or derisive way. The voice work is amazing and visuals match. You will sometimes hear the composer deciding what music is appropriate for the scene and this made me chuckle. In all, while it is a linear story, it is a fun story, that allows you to screw around a bit with the behaviors of things, It has style, it has charm, and is worth your time.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/taE_TgLydFI\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","August 17, 2015","true","3.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

I'm feeling so, so indebted to the HB project for getting this onto the radar of more people.\n\nThis is a real creative gem. The story and gameplay are very clever and original; the voice acting is superb (aside from a bit of clunkiness from the main narrator here and there), along with the writing; the ways in which you can and must play and think are varied and interesting - breaking the fourth wall and jostling your point of view in unexpected ways; and the weirdness of clashing art styles is pure joy.\n\nIt's pretty short, even for someone who is as thorough and ♥♥♥♥-around-y of a gamer as I am, which is my only complaint. It could probably be finished in only a few hours. However, at least the developers didn't do anything to artificially pad the game to stretch it out. It's concise. Also, there's a lot of little stuff to go back and hunt for, and there's something pretty fun that gets unlocked after finishing, so you can still tack on a few hours of play after completing.\n\nI give this one a 9.5.

But when I began playing it, I realized it's one of the most unique and entertaining games I've played in a long, long time. Its story and its ideas are so strange it's hard to explain, but that is not a bad thing.\n\nYou take the role of a playtester working for some developers who simply cannot get their ideas aligned and cannot get along with each other. There's more to the game than meets the eye, though, and soon the game takes a darker, more personal turn.\n\nThe gameplay consists of a lot of puzzles, but instead of working with the game mechanics, you change the game mechanics around you to get through the unfinished game.\nThe graphics aren't anything too fancy on a technical level, but the designs make up for it.

It’s not Portal, though. It’s kind of an RPG in the same way that Portal is a First Person Shooter. The trappings of its mechanics are within the recognised mechanics from a million first-person RPG games, but that’s wrapped inside a well-devised universe with well-written characters, and the actual gameplay is spun out at 90 degrees from that. If I had to add another game’s influence to cite, The Stanley Parable is where I’d go next.\n\nAnd I can’t say a lot more than that about it. The game is a metafiction, as you can see from the mostly-in-universe website. In-universe, The Magic Circle is the long awaited, long delayed sequel to a massively beloved twenty-year-old text-based adventure game (Real-world touchstones: Ultima, Bards Quest, Fool’s Errand). The author of that game is a classic games-autor white-bearded-male, who has taken on the avatar of the great God within the game – the Skyfather – but whose twenty-year promises of future games are starting to ring hollow. Veteran gamers will instantly recognise the heavy flavours of Richard Garriott in the character’s history, along with strong notes of Peter Molyneux and even to people like Cliff Johnson, and here you start, as a player given early access to this massively long awaited sequel to a hugely popular game. Except there are some assets which look… strange in context. Something isn’t quite right. The trailer hints at this fairly well.\n\n\n\nThe game plays a lot with concepts of game space, of being inside which game. It has a lot to say about narrative vs mechanics (coming from former Bioshock developers, there’s an air of critical catharsis which I would suspect more of being dirty laundry if they hadn’t got Ken Levine to voice a character), game development, fandom, actually getting things done and the sorrow of half finished universes.\n\nIt took me about 6 hours of playtime to get through it, and while that’s quite short, it’s fully formed and… complete, really. There’s a lot there, and a late twist that spins a lot of the game on its head.\n\nIt’s in early access at the moment, but as I say the game is complete. Early Access is an early release before they’ve got the translations down, which will take a while to finish and collate – there’s a lot of there there – and as far as I could tell all the glitches were intentional (it is, in part, a game about inserting your gameplay crowbar into the cracks of the world).\n\nYou should play this game. I hope they release a demo too, but don’t watch Lets Plays, don’t watch it streaming.\n\n… And that’s it, really. There’s some deeper stuff about the mechanics, about juxtapositioning, about commentary that I’ll get into eventually, but so much of what’s cool is tied heavily narrative-based modification of the mechanics, and I like the story too much to spoil it for you without giving people a chance to buy it first.","February 22","true","7.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Its described as a puzzler where you swap/change abilities in order to solve the puzzles.  The issue is there are only about 3 puzzles, and each was solved in under 2 mins.  As soon as you get flight and a railgun bolt them on to a monster and go for the ending.  The demo sabotage and editor sections afterwards not only feel disjointed but they feel like padding that was tacked on to make the game feel longer.  I finished this in 3 hours and have no desire to play it again.  If I had finished in under 2 hours I would be applying for a refund as I dont feel like I got $20 value out of this.\n\nThe tools this game provides are fantastic, there is potentional here for a great game if the devs actually put some thought into level design.  Ironicly this game suffers from 'too grand a view' and devs who feel the need to stamp their unique identity on it... the same things the 'in game dev' is mocked for.","July 16, 2015","false","3.2"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","19","32","3","0"

It's easy to see this as an allegory made for creators, especially ones filled with self doubt about their art.

Is it worth your time? It's not very long and is quite intriuging. Is it worth your money? If you have some spare cash lying around, sure. While the game is interresting it kind of keeps dropping ideas. It tries to put a lot of game mechanics into the game and changes when you use these mechanics in a kind of an episodic way.\n\nThe idea of hacking entities during the game is a very interresting mechanic (although done before in "hack and slash"). However it is quite shallow; There is a very small range of "parts"\n\nThe idea of sapotaging the E3 (named E4) conferration is fun as well. However it's a small part of the game.\n\nMaking your own game and letting people play through it is, well honestly it's not great as the "player" AI isn't great, nor the pathfinding for that matter.\n\nThe humor is a small part of the game, most of it coming from the voice recordings you find in the world. However some of the dialogue at the end is, weird at best - cringe worthy at best.\n\nThe satire is there, but it fades in comparison to some of the mechanics. Like if you think about it you see it. But while it is indeed satire, it's not very apparent.\n\nSo is it a good game, it's a series of good ideas. Is it worth your money? Not really as it honestly is too pricey at 19 euros.","July 15, 2015","false","5.4"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

I was shocked when I played it and nearly all of the voice-overs I heard were things I've heard almost word-for-word from some of the industry figures I've worked with over the years.\n\nI hate the silly "are games art?" debate as much as anyone, but The Magic Circle is the first game that we can unquestionably call "art," because there's no other good word for it -- a game that makes a unique, insightful, and incredibly important statement.\n\nA game that makes you think.\n\nA game about the "magic circle" of games within reality, but also about the "magic circle" of the reality bubbles of the teams that create them.\n\nThis game is not fan service -- it's a difficult, challenging masterpiece.

It lets you build your own little army of Frankenstein-esque monsters that only gets cooler the longer you play.\nThe gameplay is highly interesting - I found myself going out of the way to find as much stuff as I could in order to build a stronger batch of minions. The graphics serve the game's purpose extremely well, and the color effect that surrounds actual objects is an excellent way to break the monotony. The music, in a similar fashion, follows the game's need very well. Occasionally, you'll hear someone's voice (possibly Ish, or maybe a musical director, idk) commenting on how the music sounds to him, as though they were merely toying with possible tracks in the early stages of the game. It all looks very finished in a way that is intentionally unfinished, if that makes sense (prolly not, but oh well, take it for what you will XD)\nHonestly, you could just spend a good five hours exploring the overworld, mashing together your army of abominations (looking at you, Sentinal). The process is so engaging, and it just feels nice to have a loyal group of monster friends.\nAnd, for a game that does a good job preaching against story-heavy games, this game has an excellent story. It does what a game's story should do - supports the gameplay without hindering the player. Plus, it's just friggin' good. I'm horrible at explaining without spoiling, so just trust me when I say it is amazing. (Or don't, your call XD)\n\nIt's just so well made. The voice acting is excellent, the writing is damn near perfect, the graphics fit perfectly, the music is nice, the narrative is compelling, and the gameplay is just fun. I might still be a bit starry eyed from just completing it, but I HIGHLY recommend this game.","April 11","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But then I did not know what to play this weekend and installed it - and it was really worth it!\nThis is actually my first review, so this fact alone might be enough to show how I enjoyed this game.\n\nSo, what do we have here? In one sentence: It's a game about fixing a game stuck in development hell for over a decade. So it's a kind of "meta game". I like meta. Whatever...\nYou are "The Hero" running around in an "unfinished" world and using "life force" to fix things and change the creatures in the world to your needs. The world is quite small but as open as it gets. There are several puzzles to solve and all you have for doing so is a bunch of creatures - and their abilities. You can swap around these abilities and combine them to build the "perfect" creature for solving any special puzzle.\nAnd all this is packed in a nice story about the development cycle of said unfinished game.\n\nIt IS a really nice game. A bit short, though. As you can see I've about 10 hours on record and that was sufficient to beat the game twice (without skipping any cut scenes or dialogues) and get all achievements (including the notorious "collect all and everything" achievement). But in the end I really enjoyed it and can really recommend it. I don't know if it's worth 20 Euros, since I got it for far less, but on discount it's really worth it. And one thing I might add: I did not need to contact any devs of this game but all I read while figuring out some things showed me that they really care, keep close to the players and try to solve issues as they occur - including analysing individual save games. This - as a gamer and a software developer - I really appreciate! And this point alone may be worth the full price, just for supporting the devs.\n\ntl;dr: 9/10 - Great gaming experience, especially for gamers from the 90's (and earlier), I think, but a bit short.\n","April 17","true","10.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The puzzles aren't challenging and the enemies aren't much of a threat. so maybe thats why these powers didn't impress me. For me, this game is more about exploring, with minor obstacles in the way.

The first half is part adventure game, part first-person exploration, with lots of secrets to discover.  Any player who has tried exploring "outside the box" will definitely enjoy every moment of this part of the game.   The second half is so completely different and unique that it actually constitutes a spoiler even to tell you what it is.  Just be assured that if you liked the plot and dialogue in the first half, you'll love the second half.\n...\nAfter a second playthrough, and completing nearly all content, I have to mention the one real drawback to this game: It's short.  Like, really short.  A complete playthrough can run less than 5 hours, and that's listening to all the dialogue, exploring all the spaces.   I personally believe that the price was worth it, but I know most people are going to balk at $20 for 5 hours of gameplay (especially since it's probably not something most people would play more than once).","May 16, 2015","true","33.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"

Don't buy it for your kids (most of the humor would go over their heads anyway).\n\nThe term "Magic Circle" is game designer lingo for a player's immersion in the game. It's analagous to the "Fourth Wall" in drama. Anything that makes the player conscious of the fact he is merely playing a game is said to break the magic circle.\n\nThis game doesn't just break the magic circle; it body slams it, stomps on it, and makes vicious insinuations about the age of its mother's profession. In so doing, however, the game actually forges an even stronger magic circle around the player. When you are playing a game about playing a game, it becomes difficult for your brain to process the fact that The Old Pro isn't real, but rather a fictional character brought to life with a typically awesome voice performance from Garr—I mean Mercer—I mean Stephen Russell. Artsy self-absorbed writers, frustrated level designers, impatient competitive gamers, *even* OMGOMGOMG!!!!!! breathless fans, everyone feels the keen edge of The Magic Circle's wit.\n\nIt's not a long game. I spent a lot of time just fooling around and still reached the real end credits in less than 9 hours. Even if I weren't going to fool around in my current game for a few more hours and then replay it all from the start (I couldn't hear some of the dialogue over the sound of my own giggling), I would still consider it worth the price.\n\nAnyway, I hope you like it.

Replayability is high though, with various contextual comments from different characters, and a few different ways for the final stage to go.\n\nMy biggest fear when going into this game was that it would be TOO complex, and that the systems to alter and manipulate the game would be off-putting and difficult to handle.

If you had thoughts on purchasing this game, I highly reccomend that you do it. This game is definitely worth your money. The game starts out with you playing as the main character of an unfinished video game that has been in development for 10 or 20 years. There have been others that have tried the whole "unfinished game" within a game thing before, but The Magic Circle does this right. Another great thing about this game is the twists and turns. One minute you think the game is over, but then it turns out there is more. You could say the same thing about the whole game. Starting out, you'll think that all the game is doing is just satire of incompetent game developers and games stuck in development hell, but it turns out there is much more to it. The game has excellent gameplay and voice acting. The gameplay mainly involves editing enemies that approach while discovering hidden parts to the game. The editing gameplay mechanic can lead to whacky things at times like having a rock for an ally that moves and shoots out fire. The voice acting within the game really makes the story shine. All the characters had a great voice acting performance, my favorite characters have to Ish Gilder and The Old Pro. Both of them made the game an even more enjoyable experience. Overall this game was a great indie title that I have enjoyed and will probably play more of in the future.","April 2","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a game with a purpose.  And it's damn fun to boot.\n\nThe basic concept is that you're a beta tester for a hilariously and tragically unfinished game trapped in development hell by its creators, who are all various shades of borderline-insane.  Then, a being calling himself "The Pro" (voiced by Stephen Russell, the guy who played the hero in the original Thief Games) contacts you and tells you he wants you to fix this mess and get the game SHIPPED.\n\nHow do you fix it?  By literally stealing "Life" from the nooks and crannies of the world, then using it to essentially hack into enemies to make them do what you need them to do.  It's basically a big open-ended sandbox puzzle game.  One filled with secrets, hidden abilities, and tons upon tons of audio logs detailing the game's spiral into madness.\n\nEvery time I thought I had the game figured out, it threw me another curveball, forcing me to rethink everything about it.\n\nIf you can think of a way to solve a problem, it's legit.  And BOY are there a lot of possibilities.  Army of fanged mushrooms?  Easy.  Demon-monkey-dogs you lob as if they were GRENADES?  Knock yourself out.  And that's just the simple stuff you can do.  The vast amout of surprises and twists the game throws at you is sheer madness, and I love it.  And that finale...I will not be forgetting that amazing conclusion any time soon.\n\nAs someone who is studying to hopefully develop games in the future, this game hit home in so many amazing ways, and I had an absolute BLAST with it.  Don't look up anything more about the game.  You'll just spoil yourself.  This is a game that thrives on discovery and surprise.  Anything you look up can ruin things for you.\n\nSo, if you're curious about game development, or you want to see crazy new story angles, are a fan of emergent gameplay, or just want a snarky and clever open-world puzzle game, you NEED this game in your life.  TODAY.\n\nLike, Right now.  It's that good.","October 9, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game properly uses story elements as rewards for player efforts rather than giving players item after item for accomplishing objectives and the story is great enough to make you keep on chugging for more. It gets nearly everything right and is definitely worth more than the $15.\n\nGet it and play it for an afternoon where you have nothing going on. I promise you'll enjoy it.\n\nP.S. HINT HINT: The game is very good at rewarding completionists, just a heads up.","December 2, 2015","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In a way though It's more of an experience and less about a challenging game. While not completely unique, "the magic circle" has Provided me with a game I haven't really experienced anywhere else. Being one that has dabbled in game design, this game has touched a source of creativity that has long since been buried. The game's "meta" mechanics are a lot of fun and wish could be explored a little more in depth,  but the ability to create an army of "Killer Mecha Space Shrooms" should make anyone's day a little brighter. The story flip Flops between seeming to forced at times and absent at others, though the does a good job of wrapping it all together, I personally haven't played through it multiple times, yet. But the ending had many opening that could lead to different results and endings. In the end the game provides an experience of exactly what it promised. I thank the creators of "The Magic Circle" for sharing this little creation and experience and inspiring me to pick up my game creation programs again.","November 30, 2015","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is short, but more than worth the time you put into it. The game encourages you to break the rules and utilize your ability to manipulate elements in the game in creative ways. My only major complaint is that I wish the game was longer. I was honestly expecting a big second or third stage for the game. Replayability is high though, with various contextual comments from different characters, and a few different ways for the final stage to go.\n\nMy biggest fear when going into this game was that it would be TOO complex, and that the systems to alter and manipulate the game would be off-putting and difficult to handle. But, while a couple improvements can be made to make things flow a bit more smoothly, the system for altering the game mechanics is actually very simple and fun.\n\nAll in all, despite it's short run-time and the 20 dollar price tag, I say it's a good buy.","December 28, 2015","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't buy it for your kids (most of the humor would go over their heads anyway).\n\nThe term "Magic Circle" is game designer lingo for a player's immersion in the game. It's analagous to the "Fourth Wall" in drama. Anything that makes the player conscious of the fact he is merely playing a game is said to break the magic circle.\n\nThis game doesn't just break the magic circle; it body slams it, stomps on it, and makes vicious insinuations about the age of its mother's profession. In so doing, however, the game actually forges an even stronger magic circle around the player. When you are playing a game about playing a game, it becomes difficult for your brain to process the fact that The Old Pro isn't real, but rather a fictional character brought to life with a typically awesome voice performance from Garr—I mean Mercer—I mean Stephen Russell. Artsy self-absorbed writers, frustrated level designers, impatient competitive gamers, *even* OMGOMGOMG!!!!!! breathless fans, everyone feels the keen edge of The Magic Circle's wit.\n\nIt's not a long game. I spent a lot of time just fooling around and still reached the real end credits in less than 9 hours. Even if I weren't going to fool around in my current game for a few more hours and then replay it all from the start (I couldn't hear some of the dialogue over the sound of my own giggling), I would still consider it worth the price.\n\nAnyway, I hope you like it.

The developers want to you to test out the game but there you find some kind of ‘spirit’ that wants you to do something else. You then proceed to explore the world and find solutions to the problems by reprograming creatures. What is interesting is that there are many different ways of completing the game and everybody will have a different experience.

Really needs to be played to be understood\n\nI ended up getting this game through the Humble Monthly program, and I was just going through each of my 6 new games and just 'kicking the tires' so to speak and then about halfway through I started up this game... Next thing I knew about 2 hours had passed and I was halfway through constructing and populating my very own video game level for the AI to test and I had to work in 4 hours, but I didn't want to stop. I can't really say too much about this game without spoiling what the experience this game presents is about, there are some good scripted comedy bits, but some of the best comedy you can end up creating yourself using the freedom the developers offer you in game. The main ("story" mode) takes somewhere around 3 hours to complete without absolutely exploring every nook and cranny, probably another hour or two to do that, however it's the creative part of this game that will really keep you coming back to this game, if you pick it up, you'll see what I mean once you complete it the first time through. I might ordinarily feel like $20 is a little steep for a game of this length, however given that I know I will come back for at least another 5-10 hours to play around in the creative modes and see what kinds of things I can come up with and given the uniquely crafted experience that is offered here, I would say that had I come across this game normally knowing what I know now, I would happily have paid the full $20 to support this uniquely amazing dev and help them to continue to produce this type of amazing content.","April 6","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And right of the bat its clear this game wont ever be done the way this team works.\nSo natrually you meet a mysterious figure which just happens to give you the power to steal and edit powers from any creature in the game.\n\nBut what to you actually do?\nThe editing part ist not very exicting, its not a minigame or a puzzle, and no its not programming. Its a easy to understand list of base values for the creature, that you can alter. The principle is simple: Trap with a one mouse button, go near it, press E. Strip the thing naked of all is features, or simply set it to friendly and name it Carl.\nTry giving a rock some personality with ground movement and melee attack, call him Chutuly, or Jimmy, let him fly.... You know just do stuff and play around.\nThe good thing about this game is that it doesnt hold your hand to much. Instead it releases you into the wild after an half hour and goes "do whatever, here is your main goal, go find a way to do it". But during this I never felt lost. The map has a reasonable size, and contains a few "puzzles" you have to solve, to get to certain powers.\nBecause you need to get the "Flying" perk once to use it on another creature.\n\nNow of course the game isnt perfect. Once u edited a lot along the way there comes the fact that the map is confusing (every ever edited enemy is shown there, and if its to many at one place they just flood into other parts of the map (visually) ). I personally found every single character over the top, but that was ok, you kinda get that vibe from the beginning. And finally: I found the variety of objects to edit a bit lacking. Just having a few things more would have been nice, the current pool of objects is explored rather fast.\n\nSo how is the game in total?\nIts great. The idea has been translated well and makes for a nice exploration game with some puzzle solving and a lot of foolery to play around with. By providing different areas that are easy to tell apart and a constant narration to most things you do, the game doesnt get boring before it ends.\nI like it, buy it if you are into sandboxy stuff or unconventional games like the Stanley Parable that try something new. Heck, you probably still have fun as a Point&Click nerd because this game is essentially that, walk, click, do stuff, see how the world responds.\nRecommended.\n","April 6","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Lots of neat little things to hunt down and places to check out. Vaguely Metroid/Zelda like with areas being locked off until you are clever enough to get inside (or not). Got it as part of the Humble Monthly and plays lovely on F22 (linux), cranked up the settings and was smooth as silk on my older FX quad-core and my R9-280X.

I really expected none of it. The description on Steam was a bit different than what I found online, and I was badly confused when I first started searching online for some clues about the game; the creators did a good job of selling [the] concept online, which had me wondering if I was looking at the right game.\n\nThe Magic Circle had a good mix of open world and linear gameplay for such a small game, and though I had to figure out how to "beat" the game, it was not impossible to do so. I had quite the surprise when I made that last discovery -- won't share it here to preserve freshness -- on something I had been wondering about since roughly half-way through playing. So worth it when I figured it out, and finding the notes to ... someone. I think what really made the game a worthwhile purchase for me was the end-game, and realizing that searching for every nook and cranny while playing really paid off. I must say -- THAT's how you do it. Great job, guys.\n\nEven though I was able to finish the game in an afternoon/evening, this game was worth every penny for me. There were some truly original gameplay elements in this game, and I would love to see more like it in the future, in terms of how to make an "old" genre new.\n\nI apologize if my review is a bit obtuse, but trying to not spoil the surprises I had in this game was kinda hard to do. My opinion: worth the purchase, and worth the recommendation.","July 10, 2015","true","8.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/keithsboredom/recommended/323380/","keithsboredom","keithsboredom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/keithsboredom/","290 products in account","The Magic circle is a clever ~6 hour meta satire on video game development where you play a tester who has gone rouge in order to save, the game? the insane talking rock?  I was never really sure.  The majority of the game you’ll spend your time listening to the wonderfully written and acted dialogue which had me hunting for another audio clip as soon as one was over.  The actual gameplay comes in the form of editing and stealing your defeated enemies attributes in order to solve puzzles.\n\nYou’ll be taking most of your cues from Olmec from the Legends of the Hidden Temple who quickly hangs a lantern on the fact that he sounds like he's plotting to betray you.  I couldn’t help but immediately question the protagonist's sanity as I stared into the multicolored eyes of the virtual rock that I was taking orders from while he recited his Mein Kampf.  Thankfully the rest of the cast is far more humorous and relatable even while they are being little eccentric.  You’ll see these characters as giant floating eyeballs delivering the game’s backstory and plot as you leisurely walk around.\n\nWhen you run into an enemy you have to trap it with a multicolored circle that allows you to walk up and edit the creature’s attributes.  This lets you give it new abilities and make it fight for you, or accidently give it firebreath and then set yourself as it’s enemy as I did more times than i’m proud to admit.  These abilities can be swapped amongst the creatures to create floating fireproof abominations that look like they’re from the Island of Misfit Toys, which might sound disappointing but ends up going very well with the tone of the game.\n\nVery early into playing I began searching my keyboard for a sprint key that I was sure must be there somewhere—It wasn’t.  The game does allow you to teleport to various locations on the rather small map and summon the editable carcasses of your slain foes to you.  I still constantly found myself shaking my head at the pace of my character and wondering why I was given the useless zoom function instead of a sprint.  I suspect given the size of the game and the fact that you spend the majority of the time listening to audio diaries a sprint feature would end up feeling silly.\n\nVisually the game looks like a schizophrenic watched Casablanca while playing Skyrim which provided a good chuckle.  The game very adeptly attempts to appear like an unfinished game, which results in the problem that it looks like an unfinished game.  Thankfully the game doesn’t last long enough for you to grow to hate the art direction, and I found myself torn between being annoyed by it and loving it.\n\nIf you’re looking for a serious game stay far away, this game is not difficult or long, but that’s ok because it’s not trying to be!  I am almost tempted to file this game under interactive short story as it would feel far more at home there than listed as a “game” proper.  But perhaps that’s just me being pompous and attempting to force art into predefined categories which too many today do.  Even though it was short I had fun with this quirky tale and came away glad I played it, I think you will too.","July 13, 2015","true","3.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

But the fun doesn't have to end there, thanks to The Magic Circle. In The Magic Circle, you play a buggy, half-finished RPG, fixing it and altering it as you go, providing an adequate emulation of playing one of Bethesda's titles.\n\nAll jokes aside, this game is really fun. It's really more of a puzzle game than an actual RPG, but it handles the puzzles in a pretty unique way. The monsters in the game can be trapped and edited to have new abilities that you take from other monsters, giving them various purposes that can be used both for combat or solving puzzles. At one point in the game I accidentally broke the "planned" solution for crossing a river of fire, but I was able to solve the puzzle my own way by adding some Teleport abilities I had taken from another area, putting one on my fire-breathing mushroom and tossing him across the gap, and then putting another teleport on my pet rock and standing on him to teleport across the gap. It highly encourages creativity, and the monster editing function has enough variety to allow you to feel like your party is your own creation. From there the game continues to constantly deliver surprises, and while it isn't an overly long game, it makes up for it in quality. If you're interested in getting a satirical look into the world of game development or just want to create an army of flying parasitic rocks, this game is pretty great.","December 5, 2015","true","6.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Luckily, The Magic Circle manages to avoid that by balancing narrative and freedom to the point where you feel like you actually get to do something in the world while still enjoying a very clear, cohesive narrative. The game is really as involved as you make it: you can manipulate the creatures in the game in all sorts of ways to figure out new solutions to the puzzles, or you can just stroll through the game like a walking simulator (and I was that term very positively - a great walking simulator is a great thing, and a rare one as well). When you get access to the level generator, the full potential and charm of the game is fully revealed. If you were ever interested in game design, or even if you just really like video games, this game's for you. It's limited, but that just amplifies the game's message of encouraging more people to get into design.\n\nThe game is a bit on the nose at times, and there are some questionable things going on with gender roles, but all in all, it's a fantastic experience.

When I recieved the end credits the thought went through my mind: "This feels unfinished." The game just sorta ends explaining what the title means. I felt like I missed something somewhere. If that was the idea then bravo to the devs, I get the yolk.\n\n-"Puzzles" are not really puzzles, they're problems. For example: at one point there are enemies that shoot flames at you if you get to close, so all you need to find is a rock and take its 'fireproof' ability so your minions are unharmed. That's a solution to a problem, not a puzzle that took me 10+ minutes to figure out. Sure, there are a myriad of solutions you could cook up, but all of them involve just slapping traits and behaviors onto a creature and then you're done.\n\n-The world is small, VERY small. The design and style of the place is beautiful, but I wanted to see more. I understand it's small because the game in the game is "unfinished" but there was so much more that could've been explored here. This couples very badly with the short playtime.\n\nEverything put together makes the entire experience feel incomplete: end-game mechanics are very basic and limited; everything past the 'open-world' section feels rushed for the sake of satire; the game as a whole seems too short to effectively get their point across. If the whole game itself was to be a part of the joke then I didn't see it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/323380/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","The Magic Circle wants to be a game about making games. As one of those artsy meta-games, in the game it is a “game within a game”, wherein you are a playtester for a gaming company whose game, the Magic Circle, has been in development hell for the last 20 years. You are quickly introduced to the four main characters. Ish, the pretentious game developer who seems to be riffing on a number of haughty, pretentious game designers. Coda, a fangirl new to the company who has joined the team and is responsible for creating a demo but who is deeply angry about Ish’s failure to deliver a game for so long, and extremely possessive of the game world. Haze, a pro gamer who joined the team ten years ago to try and help Ish understand gamers. And Pro, an AI trapped inside the world, the PC of the previous version of the game which was trashed ten years ago when they started over from scratch.\n\nThis game is really driven by story, but it suffers from the flaw of everyone being kind of a jerk. The “good guys” are Pro and Haze, and they’re trying to destroy the company around them. It just goes downhill from there. This makes it hard to really like any of them; they’re kind of fun to watch for a bit, but after a while, it just becomes horror heaped upon horror. Moreover, the actual character arcs are fairly limited, and unfortunately, it felt a bit inconsistent at times.\n\nThe actual gameplay isn’t very good either; in fact, I’d classify it as outright bad. While some of this is intentional meta-badness, it is genuinely not a fun game to play. The gameplay consists of pretty obvious, basic actions. It is definitely not a twitch-based game, and is really centered around solving puzzles with the tools you have.\n\nThe core of the gameplay – in fact, the ONLY gameplay in the game – is shooting a little magic circle under an enemy. You have tons of time to do this, so this isn’t really hard. Once they’re trapped in your circle, you can strip off all the abilities from the enemy or even make it into your friend so it will attack other enemies for you.\n\nThis sounds neat, but it is literally the only gameplay mechanic there is. There are a few enemies later on in the game which your dudes cannot attack easily, and which require you to kill them by getting a tractor beam ability to pull them down to be attacked, or to get the railgun ability to shoot them from range. Then, you just do the same thing.\n\nThese three things – plus the ability to ride around on the back of a fireproof turtle – solve every puzzle in the game.\n\nThe result, then, is that the gameplay mostly consists of wandering around the game world searching for collectables; you can complete the entire game in under two hours if you’re just trying to beat it, and frankly, the collectibles don’t really add all that much. The puzzles are mostly just “find ability and use it to solve the puzzle”; none of the solutions are ever particularly clever, and almost all of them basically have one or two “pieces” to them.\n\nThe gameplay is just too straightforward, without anything really to mix things up until the end of the game where you create a little mini-dungeon to send the AI through – which is really very basic and not all that fun to create.\n\nAs there is no intensity in the actual gameplay itself, and the game world is deliberately drab and ugly (and very monotonous looking after a while), there’s just not much to love here. The story is only okay, it ends up coming off as a bit too caught up in how clever it thinks it is, and the gameplay itself is pretty poor.\n\nAll in all, I can’t really recommend this. It had some vaguely interesting ideas, but ultimately, not much was done with them, and the moment-to-moment gameplay of the game is just not very engaging.\n","April 14","false","8.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The game took maybe five hours to beat, half of which was not what I would call gaming.  The first time I actually thought "I'm having the slightest bit of fun" was for about half an hour at the end when you design the levels.\n\n2)  It felt like someone wanted to tell a story and chose the wrong medium  Instead of writing a book, they created an interactive video and called it a game.  I don't have too much of a problem with that genre, but it should be made known (and I should have researched this game more beforehand).\n\n3)  The story was as lame as the game-play.  I didn't care for any of the characters, and I wish they would have just gone away and let me play in my world.  Also, the game play is almost entirely basic.  You hack a creature and modify its abilities...but there are so few options that it is basically always the same.  And since you can have all of them follow you, the abilities are never strategically limited.  You never have to decide between abilities when you have them all.  Not to mention, upgrading the monsters is unnecessary, so that's a waste of a feature.  Take strategy out of the tags for this game.\n\n4)  They could have done a lot more with the game.  I feel like it is missing something, and that they could have flushed it out to make it worth the $20 price tag.\n\nAre there any Pros?\n\n1)  I liked the art style, environment, and atmosphere, though I wish you could have brought more of the dull landscape to life/color (like you do to some objects / creatures.\n\n2)  The game played smoothly and was intuitive.\n\n3)  While I didn't love the story, but I have to give them credit for originality.  It was a cool enough concept to hook me into buying the game.\n\n\nSo why wouldn't I recommend this?  I didn't have fun, plain and simple.  Mostly because it's not much of a game for the price.  Was it the worst game I've played?  Definitely not.  I think if you go into it expecting a story and your job is literally nothing but turning the page, and you got it on sale for $5, you might be able to enjoy this.  But that is not how a game should be.","August 1, 2015","false","15.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

It really feels like the developers have taken the 7 years since bioshock and tried earnestly to build an entire game dedicated to answering the central conceit and the most remarkable thing is it just about succeeds.\n\nIt poses a lot of smart questions about how different generations of game deveopers operate and the value of each from the auteurs of the 90's like Peter Molyneux, Warren Spector and Richard Garriot to their proteges in the naughties who were roundly bludgend by big buisness into impotence and went of to seek their fortunes on their own to the new age of crowd funding and nostalgia games of the latest generation.

Really really short. I beat it in < 2 hours.\n-The level design is atrocious. Seriously. It's worse than some early 90s FPSes. A significant amount of my playtime was spent being lost.\n-It thinks it's smarter than it is. The conceit of the game (you're trapped inside a game that has been dragging on in development for 10 years) is interesting but the main characters are insufferable and a lot of the writing is overwrought.\n-It is absolutely and completely without challenge. You could watch a Let's Play of the game and have nearly the same experience as playing it, albeit without the whole "getting lost" part.\n-I really cannot overstate how bad the level design is.\n\nOverall if you can buy the game for <$5 it's probably worth it. At the normal retail price it's just ridiculous. And honestly the further I get from the game the less kind I am to it. It's really profoundly mediocre which is sad as I love the idea behind it.","January 29","false","1.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It also directs some vitriol against playing games, being fans of games–pretty much anything to do with games.\n\nThe writing bounces between funny and downright cool, and the voice acting is top notch all around, but it also spends a fair amount of time giving what seems like a sincerely cynical middle finger to both itself for existing and me for playing it. So the second-half message about how cool game development is and how I should give it a shot just doesn't jive, and the whole experience breaks down for me as a result. The writing doesn't kill the game by any stretch, but what I'm being told to feel and what I actually feel just don't add up.\n\nThat said, the core ability-swapping mechanic is pretty clever and the gameplay around it evolves very organically, and there were a couple of puzzles that made me feel like a genius for solving them. The final overworld puzzle was just tedious to attempt and frustrating to fail, but that was the exception to the rule. Really, pretty much everything about the gameplay is solid; if it were tied to a less bitter narrative, I'd give it an easy thumbs up. Although, at less than four hours to finish, $20 seems pretty high to me, so I'd recommend waiting on a sale regardless.\n\nFinal thoughts: as a game, it's fine. As an *experience,* I'd call it an inferior version of The Stanley Parable with great production values.","April 4","false","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","4"

I love puzzle games, enjoy "meta" themes, and appreicate novel ideas. But this game just fell short. If you play games primarily for the story (Dear Esther, Gone Home, etc.) then you might like this. But I wanted a puzzle game and the puzzles in this game were just far too simple. It never felt rewarding to solve one.\n\nThis game description calls it a puzzle game, but it's actually tagged as an "action" and "strategy" game. It falls even shorter in these categories. There was never a challenging opponent as your pets make short work of anything you encourter. You don't ever strategize your encouters, you just run in click a waypoint for attacking. You upgrade the stats of your pets but I never once found his necessary.\n\nI know many of the reviews talk about how good the story is, but I just did not find it that entertaining. I follow some webcomics like Penny Arcade, but do not consider myself some sort of insider. With that said, I felt like most of the reviews are too quick to give credit to a story that itself was about making a video game.

On one hand I love everything about it... On the other hand I feel like that the game is limited by everything about it. I loved running through and exploring the vast world set out before me... And it was beautiful. The voice actors worked well to pull me into the world and I even saw an appearance from the guy who does Rusty Venture (The Venture Bros) play the part of one of the head creator of the company, Ish.\n\nThe puzzles were interesting, although they were a bit on the simple side. The gameplay was an interesting take on the puzzle genre that had me enjoy it throughly in the start of the game. However, you find that the game is limited by what it gives you. Within a few hours of playing the game I already had most of it done and by the time I reached the end I found the "final thing" that you had to do to be a bit underwhelming. This game lacks a satisfying major confrontation and replaces it with an incredibly simple puzzle. Combine that with the fact that you only get a few hours out of the game and you get a game that would have felt right priced at 10 dollars and not 20. I don't regret buying it, I just eagerly await any additions they add to the game in the future. In the game's current state however, it doesn't have enough to justify a 20 dollar price tag.","July 20, 2015","false","3.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Don't let needing to be the best at something keep you from being willing to fail in the eyes of other people. I know it's frightening, trust me, but this game does a wonderful job showing what happens to us when we get too focused on the prestige and not enough on completing our work.\nWithout spoiling story, my favorite moment in the whole game is the ego driven moment near the end. We hear over and over how brilliant this content creator supposedly was, but he treats the people around him as if he was a god and we are blessed to even know him. To say I’ve never known people like him as an artist would be a lie. You will meet people like this, in all sections of society but what makes this game’s story particular chilling, is on some level, I feel the story also says, be careful because this could also be you.\n\nIf on sale an absolute must buy, full price though? Depends on whether or not this review made you feel something was amiss and this story might add something to it.\n\nOn the game play side, this game is pretty simplistic. I wouldn’t really recommend it for those reasons as it’s sort of a strip minded version of programing light. Once again, you really play stuff like this to get a running commentary on something in the world or industry as a whole, this one walks that thin line, pretty well.\n","April 1","true","3.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I think this game needed a lot more effort on the gameplay side, it's just too advanced of an idea for what is painfully dumbed down execution.\n\nI suppose I should have expected a half hearted attempt at something creative.  The gaming industry likes simple mechanics.  Everything is wrong, on every level.  It's still playable to some level, but it's boring and disappointing.\n\nBeyond the gameplay mechanics we also have audio logs you have to listen to like in System Shock 2 or Portal.  But instead of just playing them in the background, you have to stop the game and listen to them in a pause screen.  It gets old very fast and contributes greatly to my boredom.\n\nThe storyline is okayish.  Although to be honest, I'm not sure what the hell was going on.\n\nThe map is confusing.  I got lost quite a bit, but there were some nice puzzles thrown in.\n\nThe thing I liked most about the game was the details it added in that normally only game developers know about.  IE Maps have origins that tell developers what direction is what, lava is actually just a pretty texture with a fire damage trigger overlaying it.\n\nOverall, it's boring.  6/10","January 1","false","4.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

If you enjoy the demo then you can expect the rest of the game to take four times as long as the demo. Also since you can continue where you left off in the demo when you buy the full game it doesn't really add that much "wait" to get to the meat of the game.\n\n*Good:\n-Educational. Can teach basics of game logic.\n-Shows the industry that "bugs" are not that bad thing if the immersion is not super important. Bugs are sometimes fun and when player is driven to find the bugs it can be a "game" in it self.\n-Has good story if you care to follow it.\n-Creature design was.. unique.\n-Has sort of map editor. Don't expect to share the maps with your friends though.\n\n*Bad:\n-Fell short on promise it showed. Expected to end with thousands of different combinations of "npc parts" but in truth got about 30 and from those only five useful and some of those became obsolete eventually.\n-Short... less than 5 hours of game-play with ½hour of cut-scene/audio content that as a player i had to wait out to get the whole thing.... Yea... Short.\n-Ending was rushed.\n-Map editor is weak and clearly built around making sure the AI can solve the map.\n\nConclusion: Like the demo and want to pay your local price for 4 more hours of pretty much same?

For example, the ending dragged on a bit incoherently as if...gee...they couldn't figure out how to end it and needed to ship.

Moreover, the story is excellently done. The characters are well developed, believable and thoroughly entertaining to listen to, with top-notch voice acting that makes the dialog thoroughly hilarious to listen to.\nUnfortunately, when it comes to the gameplay aspects, a dozen little annoyances come up and begin pestering you like dogs nipping at your heels.\n\nThe biggest, in my opinion, being a lack of a decent way to organize your minions. By the time you reach the mid-game, you will have recruited a small army of mobs and only be able to scroll through them one at a time or by searching through whatever in your immediant field of view, which bogs the pacing down tremendously.\nThe second being that in the in-game hacking minigame it can be difficult to tell whether the option you are hovering over is the one you are attempting to select or the one right below it, and can easily accidently select the wrong button and have to retry the entire section. An indicator to show whatever you are currently posed over would make a world of difference.\n\nThirdly is that some of the puzzles can be quite unintuitive, especially if you are going for 100% completion and are attempting to micromanage an army at the same time, related to point 1, above.\nNone of these points are dealbreakers, but they what could have been an amazing game merely good, and it also is worth bearing in mind that at 20$ for an experience that lasts four hours, fans who are hoping for a longer experience are going to likely wind up disappointed.\n\nOne final note is that it takes a minimum of two full playthroughs to gain all the acheviements, which I feel is an unfortunate design choice for a humor-focused title such as this. The old adage about a joke never being as funny the second time you hear it rings true in this situation, especially since if someone has already found all of the hidden extras, they are unlikely to want to replay the story again just for completion sake.\n\nThat being said, I did enjoy my time playing the magic circle, most especially due to the stellar voice acting the cast put on. The story is definitely the highlight here, and I would recommend it to those who enjoy meta-commentary based games such as The Stanley Parable.\n\n8/10.

The world is expertly crafted to resemble a pre-alpha game that’s a mash of too many ideas, all coexisting in the same code base which end up mashing together in unintended ways. This is reflected in the game play which is based around messing with things and changing up behaviours so you can access things you otherwise wouldn’t be able to. The story is one that definitely has a specific target audience in mind and, whilst it might not be for everyone, definitely plays to its strengths as a piece of commentary on the industry. It might not meet my criteria for a must-play game for everyone but if, like me, you feel like a part of the greater games industry, then there’s definitely a lot to like in The Magic Circle.\n\nRead my full review here: https://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2015/09/25/the-magic-circle-perfectionism-vs-fandom/","September 24, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A tenth of the way in, there is even a similar title-screen fake-out that feels like a direct homage.  But The Magic Circle isn't about the illusion of choice.  It's about making games fun, and the complex relationship between making games and playing them.  And it's not as pretentious as The Stanley Parable-- if anything, it pokes fun at that element of "art games."\n\nIs The Magic Circle a fun game?  I certainly enjoyed myself.  It's not particularly difficult, or long, but it backs up its sometimes-subtle, sometimes-blunt statements about what motivates players by living by them.  Exploration, choice, challenge, reward, cool powerups.  It's a nonlinear game about lateral thinking.  You're really free to solve most puzzles however you can get the mechanics handed to you to work.\n\nThe game's aesthetic is beautiful, and keeps surprising you throughout.

You spend most of the game exploring the world of a game locked into development hell in order to collect powers, hidden lore, and audio files. The writing is quite witty and funny at times. I'm not sure whether or not it's worth the $20 price. Though it took me 8 hours to collect everything, you can beat the game in only a couple of hours. It could have used more puzzles and I feel the game could have utilized the main game mechanic more. Regardless, I really enjoyed the Magic Circle.

You asume the role of a Beta tester who is contacted by the protagonist of the original version of the game. Whose goal is to ruin the game in any way possible. The story takes a few different twists and turn having you venture to E4 and into 8-bit sci-fi settings. Aswell you can discover other elements of the story scattered in glitchy objects and audio logs. Overall the story is phenomenal and I loved it. 9/10\n\nVisuals: They are amazing! Having all the textures be unfinished sketches but with colored versions appearing around you and your allies was a great Idea. 9/10\n\nGameplay: It's good and interesting but slowly gets a boring after awhile with little to no chages to the formula. The way it works is you can take attributes form some enemies and stitch them onto other creatures to create new allies. However there is only so many time is it's fun to have a howler fly around and breath fire on a guy with 4 heads. The game also has great emphasis on exploration with stuff such as in game dev logs and Life upgrades. 8/10\n\nFinal thoughts: The magic circle is great but is a little too short for the price paid and the gameplay can become a little stale. But I must stress this game is still wort you time and if you can find it on sale it is a game worth owning.\n\n8.5/10","August 28, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

In the game you are a player character that is trapped inside a game that will never be finished. Your goal? Well that is not quite clear in the beginning. Exploration of the world, and who you are, are the main driving forces early on. As the story develops you begin to learn the fate of the people who were working on the game, and where everything went wrong.\n\nThe game likes to play with your expectations and uses the fact that you are in a broken, unfinished game, to play with the idea of bugs and glitches. That is why when the game crashed on me one time, I thought it was part of the game.\n\nOverall I have enjoyed my time with The Magic Circle. With a unique mash-up of art styles, witty and funny characters, and a combat system more like Pokemon than a first person action game, The Magic Circle is a game that anyone can enjoy.\n\nSimilar Titles:\nPortal 2\nThe Stanley Parable\nThe Talos Principle\n\nIf you would like to see more of the game, check out my Indie Showcase of The Magic Circle\nhttps://youtu.be/7KKd7tcJs3k","June 27, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Do they wish their creators would stop wasting time worrying about ludonarrative dissonance, death of the author and what went wrong in their lives for years on end without fixing fundamental flaws in the code? Well you get to find out as you're put into the shoes of an unfinished roleplaying game's protagonist whose vaporware crown could make Duke Nukem Forever feel like it accomplished something.

Here's a list of pros and cons:\n\nPros:\nNice comedy, I found myself laughing at many points during the story.\n\nWithout spoiling much, the game flip-flops on itself frequently towards the end, keeps things fresh with new challenges and mechanics.\n\nVoice acting is good and you may find yourself sympathising with some of the "gods".\n\nMessing around customising minions to solve puzzles is fun and interactive.\n\nCons:\n\nGame world is small and even if you explore fully and solve everything, it won't take that long to complete. This leads into my second con.\n\nThe price. For 20 dollars I could buy so many other things that I can get more fun-time out of than just the 3-5 hours for this game. Even with the sale to 17 dollars, it's still a bit steep.\n\nOverall I reccomend the game, but it isn't worth the 20 dollars. I'd wait till we get a big steam sale to pick this particular gem up unless you're willing to pay the full price.","July 10, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoy the demo then you can expect the rest of the game to take four times as long as the demo. Also since you can continue where you left off in the demo when you buy the full game it doesn't really add that much "wait" to get to the meat of the game.\n\n*Good:\n-Educational. Can teach basics of game logic.\n-Shows the industry that "bugs" are not that bad thing if the immersion is not super important. Bugs are sometimes fun and when player is driven to find the bugs it can be a "game" in it self.\n-Has good story if you care to follow it.\n-Creature design was.. unique.\n-Has sort of map editor. Don't expect to share the maps with your friends though.\n\n*Bad:\n-Fell short on promise it showed. Expected to end with thousands of different combinations of "npc parts" but in truth got about 30 and from those only five useful and some of those became obsolete eventually.\n-Short... less than 5 hours of game-play with ½hour of cut-scene/audio content that as a player i had to wait out to get the whole thing.... Yea... Short.\n-Ending was rushed.\n-Map editor is weak and clearly built around making sure the AI can solve the map.\n\nConclusion: Like the demo and want to pay your local price for 4 more hours of pretty much same? If yes then YES! Recommended!\n\nEnding made me laugh hard.","July 10, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I beat the game in 4 hours with some fiddling around the edges, and it was absolutely worth the $16 I paid for it on sale. I wouldn't even have felt bad paying the full $20 for it.

You spend most of the game exploring the world of a game locked into development hell in order to collect powers, hidden lore, and audio files. The writing is quite witty and funny at times. I'm not sure whether or not it's worth the $20 price. Though it took me 8 hours to collect everything, you can beat the game in only a couple of hours. It could have used more puzzles and I feel the game could have utilized the main game mechanic more. Regardless, I really enjoyed the Magic Circle. I found it charming and funny.I loved the characters.\n\nIn a marketplace full of games boasting "non-combat exploration" and witty satire, The Magic Circle is one game that does it right.","August 26, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

You asume the role of a Beta tester who is contacted by the protagonist of the original version of the game. Whose goal is to ruin the game in any way possible. The story takes a few different twists and turn having you venture to E4 and into 8-bit sci-fi settings. Aswell you can discover other elements of the story scattered in glitchy objects and audio logs. Overall the story is phenomenal and I loved it. 9/10\n\nVisuals: They are amazing! Having all the textures be unfinished sketches but with colored versions appearing around you and your allies was a great Idea. 9/10\n\nGameplay: It's good and interesting but slowly gets a boring after awhile with little to no chages to the formula. The way it works is you can take attributes form some enemies and stitch them onto other creatures to create new allies. However there is only so many time is it's fun to have a howler fly around and breath fire on a guy with 4 heads. The game also has great emphasis on exploration with stuff such as in game dev logs and Life upgrades. 8/10\n\nFinal thoughts: The magic circle is great but is a little too short for the price paid and the gameplay can become a little stale. But I must stress this game is still wort you time and if you can find it on sale it is a game worth owning.\n\n8.5/10","August 28, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The only regrettable part of the game is how compact it is that you never really get to test the full limits of the game world, but the story ties up in a wonderfully neat fashion.

The world is expertly crafted to resemble a pre-alpha game that’s a mash of too many ideas, all coexisting in the same code base which end up mashing together in unintended ways. This is reflected in the game play which is based around messing with things and changing up behaviours so you can access things you otherwise wouldn’t be able to. The story is one that definitely has a specific target audience in mind and, whilst it might not be for everyone, definitely plays to its strengths as a piece of commentary on the industry.

The story starts with you joining this shadow of a finished game. You are greeted by the game's creator and soon learn that he just won't let the game be finished. As time progresses you, the HERO gain the ability to give deleted items and creatures life! Armed with your abilties and a sarcastic all knowing prisioner; you finish what the creator started.\n\nThis game combines story, sandbox, and immersion tactics to really make you feel like the HERO. The sandbox aspect come from the players ability to change what has been deleted. You can mix and match creature parts to solve puzzles.\n\nThere were some parts in the story that left me scratching my head. Because the game has a sandbox aspect, a player can wander around with little knowledge of where to go to progress the story.\n\nLooking at the game as a whole, I would give it a 9/10.

A tenth of the way in, there is even a similar title-screen fake-out that feels like a direct homage.  But The Magic Circle isn't about the illusion of choice.  It's about making games fun, and the complex relationship between making games and playing them.  And it's not as pretentious as The Stanley Parable-- if anything, it pokes fun at that element of "art games."\n\nIs The Magic Circle a fun game?  I certainly enjoyed myself.  It's not particularly difficult, or long, but it backs up its sometimes-subtle, sometimes-blunt statements about what motivates players by living by them.  Exploration, choice, challenge, reward, cool powerups.  It's a nonlinear game about lateral thinking.  You're really free to solve most puzzles however you can get the mechanics handed to you to work.\n\nThe game's aesthetic is beautiful, and keeps surprising you throughout.  James Urbaniak, Ashly Burke, Karen Dyer and Stephen Russell are obviously some incredible voice talent.\n\nI really enjoyed it, and highly recommend it.","September 23, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I work for a company, I won't say which, that is pretty big and has had a game in development for, while not 20 years, quite some time now.\n\nI can't personally relate to the joke The Magic Circle makes of games that have been locked in development hell for one reason or another (in TMC's case the creator's misguided search for perfection), since I've only been with this company for about half a year now, but I did get a pretty big kick out of it, looking sort of from the outside of things.\n\nThe Magic Circle could be called a critique of the current state of the video games industry, at least the parts of it that delay games indefinitely only to release products that are obviously terrible, as well as making fun of internal developer politics and struggles. There were even a couple of QA jokes I got to enjoy ("Hell hath no fury like a tester scorned"). The game seems to take a crack at just about every video game trend in recent years, from episodic content to streaming let's players, overblown stories and undelivered promises.\n\nIt's very funny, too, especially in how the game's mechanics of mixing and matching abilities comes to fruition. *HERE THERE BE SPOILERS* a portion of the game requires the manipulation of a live demo; the "game" is *supposed* to have the demo hero walk into a room containing a baby, but I was able to manipulate the baby's abilities so that it could fly and breath fire at the demo hero. I'm honestly still laughing about it right now as I type this.\n\nThe game takes about 3-4 hours to complete, depending on how much time is spent in the end game, but the experience is well worth it.","July 15, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the game you are a player character that is trapped inside a game that will never be finished. Your goal? Well that is not quite clear in the beginning. Exploration of the world, and who you are, are the main driving forces early on. As the story develops you begin to learn the fate of the people who were working on the game, and where everything went wrong.\n\nThe game likes to play with your expectations and uses the fact that you are in a broken, unfinished game, to play with the idea of bugs and glitches. That is why when the game crashed on me one time, I thought it was part of the game.\n\nOverall I have enjoyed my time with The Magic Circle. With a unique mash-up of art styles, witty and funny characters, and a combat system more like Pokemon than a first person action game, The Magic Circle is a game that anyone can enjoy.\n\nSimilar Titles:\nPortal 2\nThe Stanley Parable\nThe Talos Principle\n\nIf you would like to see more of the game, check out my Indie Showcase of The Magic Circle\nhttps://youtu.be/7KKd7tcJs3k","June 27, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Stephen Russel, especially, is a joy to listen to (which is great as you'll hear plenty of him), bringin his near-trademark "no-nonsense down-to-earth" style to his role. Regardless,\n\nThe writing, too, is great, with each character's dialogue showing enough content to give me a sense of their basic motivations (creator wants to make the game perfect, lead actress wants the thing to be over with and move on, etc), but as you play, you find enough information to elivate them from *just* characitures and sterotypes into actual people. In the end, I found myself fealing sorry for the villian of the piece despite him having brought it on himself.\n\nSecond, the gameplay: It's a nice twist on puzzle gaming (for the most part) where you're going around rewriting and editing the world around you - in a very literal fashion - to suit your wims. This gives all the puzzles a very non-linear feal, giving me the real sense that I could find new answers to every puzzle I faced.\n\nNot that these are "puzzles" in the traditional sense, no no no - no Hanoi Towers here. Similar to the likes of Myst, this game uses the world itself as your obstacle, with your motivation being exploration and self-challenge. All too often, I would just sit there, wracking my brain over how to use what I'd collected so far to get across some barrier to the goodie that awaited me.\n\nThird, the gmae's style: even though the point is that the game is very "unfinished", I actually do like the black-and-white overall theme of everything. It makes the use of what sparse color there is in the game VERY striking, even jarring, which is exactly what the creative team probably wanted.\n\nOf course, the style of "unfinished" extends everywhere, from the creatures you meet all the way to the music itself, which somehow manages to sound great despite the composer/sound designers intentionally flubbing their parts to make it sound very rough draft.\n\nThe humor's good, too. I found myself laughing at several moments in the game, when I wasn't ♥♥♥♥ling with glee, at any rate. And the subtlties of this game's story are near critical mass. I won't spoil them for you save to say this: collect everything you can. Leave no stone untunred, mess with everything you get access to, and explore all those hard-to-reach and out-of-the-way places. You will find the effort well worth it.\n\nThis game does have some flaws. The end game puzzle, while EXTREMELY satisfying, felt a bit buggy - and funnily enough, that's not intentional here. Too often, I'd be unable to take some actions because the game wouldn't let me despite my having what I needed to do so. If it's not a bug, then I would recommend some better indication of what it takes to use things properly here, to avoid needless confusion.\n\nIs the game short? Sure, I beat it in 7 hours without 100%ing it, and I imagine it would take about 10 for me to get what I missed. But that's not a bad thing here, as it's not about qunatity, but quality. This game is as long as it needs to be. No more, no less, and for that, it's extremely satisfying without being daunting.\n\nI recommend this to anyone who's interested in the game industry in any capacity besides just "but game, play game, trade it back in", especially to those who are looking for some snark and fun gameplay to go with thei commentary.\n\nAnd to answer the creators' urging at the end of this game: yes, I'm interested in making something of my own now. What form that will be is unclear. But the spark has been lit.","July 19, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The "game" aspect of it won't last forever; it's more a taste, an idea for you to play around with, but it's a very good one: modifying the attributes and abilities of creatures is a lot of fun, while it lasts, and there are a few basic puzzles that can be solved in a variety of ways.\n\nPut simply, if you're into "meta" humour and storytelling, you'll like this. At one point, you get to actually design a level, and one of the characters does a real-time "Let's Play" stream of it, commenting on everything from music usage to health potion placement.\n\nAlso impressive that, while the game is one big reference to its own industry and is full of visible influences from famous games, it doesn't resort to clumsy *direct* references.\n\nJust about the only criticism I can aim at TMC is the abrupt nature of its story - it could have leaned just a little more in the direction of Portal, with more actual puzzles and gameplay, and I would have loved to hear just a little more about the characters.","February 8","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not a game you will find yourself playing for months on end but the time you do spend is fun. You get to edit the game as you go along, break the rules and my favourite break the fourth wall.\nThe voice acting is out of this world. I could listen to Ish, Maze and Coda read a dictionary.\nI had a little army of my own following me around who I could set upon my enemies with a single click.\nLove this game.\n\nAlso, the devs are on top of things. I had an issue, posted about it in the tech support forums. There was an update to the game the next day that fixed the problem.

Definitely worth playing. There are some definite downpoints to the game. The beginning open-roaming part is too short. And the game gets pretentious and preachy in the later parts.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/losian/recommended/323380/","losian","Losian Rooke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/losian/","285 products in account","I'd put this solidly somewhere from "not bad" to "pretty good." I can't say it resonated deeply with me, but I'm not a creator nor do I have an immense creative drive. Perhaps this game hits better with those who enjoy spending time making up worlds and desiging levels, or perhaps those more familiar with the fan-circle, forums, and other stereotypes.\n\nPart of me almost wished the sci-fi elements were a whole game because the music/art style was pretty spot on, but besides that.. I dunno. This is one of those games I can't go into a lot of detail about because, I think, a lot of it is more of how you see, interpret, and pursue things. But overall I'd say I enjoyed it reasonably, even if it didn't resonate to the depths of my soul.\n\nAs much as I know everyone is still caught in the "too-popular" vs Hipster mode about it, it's not an Undertale experience. TMC takes the fourth wall down a lot sooner and faster, and in much more obvious ways, though it does toy a bit. At the end most of everything is neatly wrapped up and I don't find myself deeply emotionally moved nor attached - but that isn't necessarily bad, nor was it necessarily the designers' goal to do those things, but it's definitely different. I feel like it was maybe supposed to be a bit more "Ah!" for me, but again - I think this may just not be quite the game that really tickles the deeper fancies of someone who doesn't find the nuances of designing levels and such to be especially compelling, or perhaps someone who doesn't have direct experience with dealing with "fans" in a situation like that.\n\nI'm really not sure.. but ultimately, I can't say that I'd strongly recommend this to everyone and anyone, it definitely is more of a niche title, but that isn't a bad thing.","April 11","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I realized how short it was and got a little upset, but I went back to try getting all the achievements. So far I have all but one, which is "Compelete everything".\n\nAfter doing that, I'm really loving the extra detail that was put in behind the main objective as 'side information' or so. I wouldn't call it side-story, because there isn't much to go on, besides what is plainly put out in the beginning. I'm more trailing on now than anything, so!\n\nI like it. I like it a lot. Maybe it was a bit short, but I liked the idea that it makes fun of Early Access games and developers that don't keep their promises of finishing said games. I hope there's more content in the future, either as free attachments or rather cheap at least. For a twenty dollar game? Pretty meh about, if you have the money. Ten dollars?

The writing is decent to good and the voice actors do an excellent job. Lots of little moments throughout the game had me smiling, except for the fourth wall breaking speech at the end. That was dumb. The part right after that though, really good and good on you devs for adding that bit in.\n\nThis is beyond the scope of the game I think but a slightly larger tileset for some variation and additional weaponry besides a sword for the demo hero at the end would have been nice.","May 1","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It allows the player to control certain aspects of the game world that they find themselves in such as enemy capabilities. This is the extent of control that you get as a player but through this limited amount of control you can do almost anything you wish. It's this confinement that breeds creativity. While the writing early on can be a bit awkward the game's story really shines as you find audio logs that flesh out the characters and change logs that show the dynamic between gameplay and art. The only problem I ran into with the game itself was that it was too short, and this just stems from a desire to play more. Overall this game is an amazing look into game design and development hell that can be funny and sad at the same time.","May 29","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
