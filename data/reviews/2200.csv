The Arena is a cruel, cruel Mistress - she will build you up, only to break you, & just when you think you're rid of her, she'll drag you back into her clutches.\n\nIn short, for those of you who are woefully unaware, Quake 3 is hands down the pinnacle of the "Old School" '90s FPSs designed by the original id Software team, using an entirely different Gameplay model than the Modern FPSs of CoD & BF. A more common term for it is "Twitch Gaming" due to the extreme level of reaction time required to truly match up against not only other players, but also the Bots. To quote Dark Souls - "Prepare to Die", because you will, over, & over, & over.\n\nSeriously, buy it. Once you do, get ioQuake 3 (Google it), & the Quake 3 Widescreen Fixer Mod.\n\nAs far as the Online Multiplayer portion (which is arguably 95% of the Game) fear not, for the MP Community is still extremely active, & if you're of the ultra-competitive nature, the CPMA Mod (Challenge Pro Mode Arena - the Standard in Q3 Competitive Play since nearly the very beginning) ups the ante by making an already difficult Game even harder (works both Online (PvP) & Offline (Bots).\n\nSee you in the Arena, challenger....

From 1999 to the present, this game has been at the heart of Esports throughout.  After Challenge Pro Mode Arena (CPMA) was released the competitive community divided.  Since then, the game's popularity has seen a steady decline.  Currently, there is only a small crowd of hardcore fans that still enjoy this game.\n\nAround 2007-2008 a new iteration of this game came along as a free-to-play web version named QuakeLive.  Download QLPrism (standalone browser made specifically to run QuakeLive) to fully enjoy.  As a pro-subscriber in Quakelive you can spawn servers to run all kinds of fun gameplay from simple duels to team based games and now Quakelive even includes Race mode (Quake3 DeFRaG Mod).  Quakelive is constantly updated with new content (gametypes, maps, custom options) making it the most comprehensive Quake ever.\n\nQuake 3 is one of the most enduring games in all of FPS history.  The gameplay is dynamic, engaging and unique.  If you are a fan of fast-paced, deathmatch style gameplay, Quake3/Quakelive is the ONLY game for you.  Takes years to master, takes seconds to become addicted.\n\nCurrently, there is some debate over whom the G.O.A.T. (Greatest Of All Time) of QuakeLive is.  The greatest contenders for the title include the two finalists of Dreamhack Winter 2013, the Belarussian "Cypher" or the American "Rapha."  Other names through the years include American "Zero4", the Swedish aim master "Toxjq", and the notorious Russian "Cooller".\n\nIn the end, I see the competition for this title always coming back to the two:  Cypher or Rapha!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/2200/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Quake 3 Arena isn't really an expected sequel of Quake franchise. It actually throws off single-player portion fully and focuses on mutliplayer part, which was quite wise as of that time. Arena-styled Deathmatch was still hot and at the peak of interest, you see. It came out in 1999. It's notable that in same year Unreal pulled off same trick, coming out with Unreal Tournament.\nIt also had ports to Dreamcast and PS2. Dreamcast is awesome, supporting keyboard+mouse, 4-player split-screen, had online multiplayer and had new awesome music that PC doesn't have. PS2 version didn't had online part, but had improved single-player, with some story, from what I know. Didn't check out that one yet, but it has different final boss.\n\nAs you expect, it has usual technical problems nowdays.\nGame doesn't support widescreen by default. But you can look up Community Guide on Steam, one explains how to set it up easily.\nSteam Overlay is conflicting with this game as well. If you try to immeditly play at default setup, you will be horrified by all the graphical flickers and glitches. You have to go to game's system options and disable "GL Extension", after that it should be fine.\nThough, some computers will still experience crashes here and there. In this case you will have to disable whole Steam Community for this game. Bai bai overlay.\nI think that auto save from Team Arena expansion may erase Quake 3 Arena save. Goes both ways. So be careful with that one.\n\nAs for multiplayer community, it's somewhat alive. There are some servers with some players. Most often you will meet servers full of bots. Other times it will be pro players who will rip you apart.\n\nSo, what can I say. Q3 is a classic arena, where you spawn, you stock up, you encounter, you restock. Or respawn. While strafejumping and bunnyhopping like a chicken. Everybody starts the same, they spawn in random spot with no good weapons. After that you have to grab all the goodies on the map. Weapons, ammo, health, armor and powerups. Stocking and restocking is quite important, having more armor and health than opponent will put you into superior position. If you are good at shooting and maneuvering, that is. Health and armor over 100 slowly drop down, so you want to make use of it. You also want to be the first to grab the respawning powerup, which is announced by subtle sound. Pro players time it in mind. Remaining powerups drop from defeated players.\nAnd when it comes to duel, you should make sure that opponent will not get to timed powerups and big bonuses. It's called "Arena Control". It'a also wise to sometimes not to encounter the opponent.\n\nIt also has some physics exploits like bunnyhopping and harder to pull off strafejumping. Thankfully, bots don't use them.\n\nWeapons are designed to be balanced with each other and to be useful in each own situation. It's mostly a tried and classic combination weapon set, of rocket launchers, shotgungs, railguns and such, so people who wanted a gun that ricochets around walls and turns enemies into ice cream critized them heavily. They work really nicely though. Railgun requires at least two hits on a row for average opponent, which is always better than usual instakill of sniper rifles in other games. Shotgun is good even for medium distance and just gives off a nice hitscan punch. Rocket Launcher is universal, good for splash damage with huge direct hit damage. Good for rocketjumps too. Really, it's great to see that the game took more balanced weapon approach of Quake 2 and tried to combine it with faster pace of Quake 1.\n\nLevel design is great too, with nice astethic. It's either sci-fi base or more of gothic-hellish red style. Like Quake 1 style, but more careful and even more evil at times, it's great. Has enough verticality. Just nicely done, with all the curves and corners. It also has some interesting "platforms in black space" levels, though those are the worse bunch as far as balance goes. Too much open space, railfun users be happy. Gets even worse on the level which has many lift-platforms, making it all look quite messy. Otherwise, nice layouts with nice looks.\nSoundtrack is also nice too, being ambient-like at times and more actiony techno at others. Somewhat unique.\n\nIt has Free-For-All Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Duel and Capture the Flag modes. And bots are pretty bad at Capture the Flag for some reason. Expect to see them running with machine gun, failing to defend and failing to retrive the flag.\n\nNow, as far single-player, well, it's pretty much a bunch of bot matches with some progression. The in manual says that mysterious race Vadrigar teleported the greatest warrior of all time into arenas for their own amusement and they can't be fooled by Death, combatants just respawn. in the end you will beat current champion Xaero, who's spirits will leave the body and it will turn into statue. And errrr, I guess you will be still stuck in Arena. Yep, story is quite an excuse. You will not see any kind of story in game itself, just means that it has many different skins with no bio. Like Id All-Stars, including Doom, Grunt and Ranger. But hey, some skins are cool, check out huge eyeball on two hands.\n\nYou should play on Hardcore if you are a good player. Normal and lower ones handicap bots actually.\n\nAnd yea, it's just a bunch of Deathmatch matches with boss-like duel match for each Tier. In Deathmatch you will be hunting the weakest and spamming, in Duel you better be controlling spawn of bot's favourite weapon if you want to survive. Final boss really requires it, being Railgun auto-bot pro. This "campaign" will fly past quickly. Oh well, at least it has some feeling of progression, better than just leaving player with skirmish only.\nDid I tell you that bots actually have a bit of behavior personality and favourite weapons?\n\nAnd if you want to go online, then as said, it doesn't have as many players. More of bots. And it has really bad server browser that no one ever liked. Can't even categorize by amount of players.\n\nTo be honest, with Quake Live around, there is almost no reason to get Quake 3 for online, most of players went to Live. Quake 3 does have gibs, blood and it has Campaign of sorts, so maybe it's better for offliners who don't want to be beaten by pros.\nAnd yea, this is old game with classic DM rules. Most modern gamers will not dig it for long. No leveling or such, more duel-based than team-based. But at least it was nice at the time, even if didn't try to be as original as UT, instead giving players more of classic set.","August 9, 2015","true","4.4"," 53 of 57 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","53","57","5","0"

Fast paced arcade style action, and Quake 3 had some of the most finely tuned of this, with maps that were fast paced, as well as with their own pitfalls, camping spots, and high-risk items. My favorite part about this game was the customization, I have custom skins, models, weapon paks, maps, everything, and something about "shaders" makes me thrilled to see!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/2200/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","/!\ Before you start this game ***DISABLE STEAM OVERLAY*** to get it working. /!\\n\nThis game absolutely rocked the FPS world back in the day. As a young pre-teen, I played my sports outside, did my homework and when I could, I'd jump on the PC to play this. If you have played Unreal tournament, it may ring a few familiar bells while playing this. If you can tolerate old graphics, you'll able to enjoy the gameplay.\n\nWhat is Quake 3 : Arena? It is a first person shooter (FPS) multi-player focused game with fast pace featuring players duking it out for in front of a race called the Vadrigar. All the player movements are normal (four directional + strafing) with the addition of jumping. Mouse button 3 will allow the player to zoom and C will let the player crouch. Throughout the map there are items available for pick-up in which the player can press enter to use them. The basic strategy back in the day was jumping up and down and strafing while shooting. Playing the game today after so many years seems players have really figured out this technique and it's almost near impossible for me to hit them. Most servers are decently friendly (for n00bs as well) but some servers have some very good players. Most FPS's will demand a lot of attention from the player but this FPS will keep you moving due to paranoia. Non-stop movement is recommended.\n\nThe AI within the game is actually a formidable opponent. Upon first playing the game, I had some serious trouble beating the first level. I got back on the horse eventually and was able to ride to the next tier. One player mode will have you square off against stronger and stronger opponents the more you progress. The weapons in the game are outlandish in design and style while having their strong and weak points. Some weapons will benefit the player from a long range while some will demand a shorter range. The BFG10K is a plasma based weapon that can fire rapidly. The gauntlet is a short ranged melee type weapon in which the announcer will announce "humiliation" if an opposing player is killed. The gauntlet does not require ammo. The lightning gun fires a beam of "lightning" and is useful for groups of opponents. The railgun fires a hot slug rounds at a high velocity. It would be better to use this gun from a distance. The plasma gun obviously fires burst of plasma but is slow regarding it's firing rate. There is also a rocket launcher (that is pretty self explanatory and is my favorite weapon as it can make players bounce or explode). The last two include a machine gun and a grenade launcher. All the guns are fun to use but players will find their own style which work for them.\n\nThere are items scattered throughout the level and respawn after a short amount of time. The first item includes a red armor icon which has the most defense out of all armors. The yellow armor is half as good as the red and armor shards (pieces) will increase your armor by increments of +5. Besides armor, there is health around the map available for pickup. The blue health orb will replenish your health to a maximum while an orange health orb will only do half of what the blue can do. The small gold and green health orbs are the smallest units of replenishment. Also included are power ups. Power ups include a blue icon which quadruples the damage you deal, a red regeneration icon in which when you receive damage your heath will regenerate, a yellow icon which doubles your speed you fire your weapons, a purple icon which allows you to jump at unbelievable heights, invisibility (which is self explanatory) and a battle suit that can protect you from literally anything from the environment (lava, water + splash damage from opponents). Additional items include a personal teleporter (which will transport you into a random spot when in trouble), a medkit which can be activated by the user, in-place teleporters which have a pre-determined destination, jump pads which will launch the player and acceleration pads that will launch the player in the direction they are facing. Don't face the wrong side or an edge when approaching such a pad!\n\nAs I've said, this game is big time multi-player focused even though it has some single player events. There are differing game-modes to keep the player engaged : Free for all (where everyone plays for themselves), team deathmatch where two teams compete for the highest "frag" (kill) score, tournament mode which is one versus one ending after a set time and lastly, capture the flag. Capture the flag is played on maps in which both opposing sides have the same map layout (to keep everything fair).\n\nThis is a good game for hardcore FPS fan's while the casual gamer may find the graphics and gameplay lacking due to the difficulty. I would consider this one of those games where you really have to take the time to perfect your skill to get the most joy out of it. Back in the day, this game would have got a solid (8/10) rating and still can hold it's own with gameplay. Now that's it's aged :\n\n\nRATING : 6.95/10\n\n\n\nGameplay	B+	Story / Campaign	C+	Visuals / User Interface	C+	Sounds / Music	C	Replay-ability	B-	Overall 	B-","November 26, 2015","true","0.8"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","38","43","0","3"

After my first experience playing Quake II, which you can check that review for the experience, I had no idea what to expect from Quake III except greatness. It could have been a new single player, an enhanced multiplayer, really anything. But the word Arena was the next word I saw on the disk. I was a pretty smart kid, so I knew it was going to have a badass multiplayer. Little did I know that it was going to be ALL multiplayer.\n\nSo I booted up the game after installing it and started watching the intro. It showed some guy shooting down things and running out of ammo. The guy runs away and then decides to rush in. Immediately, I was a little unimpressed. After the Quake II intro, I was expecting awesomeness! Now it was just showing a cliche FPS sequence. Then, after diving towards the enemies, something unexpected happens. Time freezes as the guy is being teleported to some unknown place. This is where id Software did NOT disappoint! After being teleported, it then shows some gameplay of what I was going to be playing with random letters zooming out. I watched the gameplay and knew it had to be awesome. Then, the legendary words filled the CRT monitor.\n\nQUAKE III ARENA\n\nI was hyped. I could not wait. So I went to the options to peek around and noticed there was a better Player Setup screen than Quake II. You could actually see who you were choosing before you picked them. MUCH better than having to scroll through the different models in Quake II to pick your character. And yes. Before you ask, the same customization of Quake II with being able to play as many different characters is avaliable here too. After picking this weird alien thing named Flisk, I immediately went into the game.\n\nThe graphics looked really nice. I was gazing upon the room I was in and noticed all the little details in the room. My eyes were like a kid in a candy store. The textures popped out like flowers in a field. The graphical detail was legend, and everything just seemed amazing. Then I noticed the mirror in the room. I gazed at my reflection and loved the little details on my character.\n\nAnother thing I noticed was the sudden announcer coming through my speakers. "WELCOME TO QUAKE III ARENA!!" I had never heard such a thing in a video game before. It was really mindblowing at the time. I then decided to test fire the guns I had collected. The machinegun sounded like a more powerful version of the one from Quake II, and the Shotgun sounded like it was the most devastating thing in the game. I decided to go outside the room and see what was going on around the map.\n\nI immediately ran into Crash, the first enemy opponent in the game. She's like Doomguy except she's a girl. I shot her down with my shotgun and noticed that she talked to me in text like she was a friend in real life. Wow! Talk about advanced! I never had a character talk to me in text like that. It was something really special at the time and it's something games just don't do anymore. It's kinda sad, but I can see why.\n\nAlright so the gameplay. Well, it's a shooter that is a heavily polished version of Quake II's multiplayer. Even the single player is just a bunch of fights with bots. Nothing really special, but it's good practice. The weapon balancing is something id wanted to do in this game and it really works well. Each weapon has its own use, just like the single player in Quake and Quake II. The Rocket Launcher is good for if your enemy is mid range, while guns like the Lightning Gun and Machinegun are great for long range attacks. The Shotgun is definitely used best at shorter ranges because of the more realistic spread this time around.\n\nThe gunplay isn't the only thing you'll want to learn in Quake III. Movement is definitely a really important skill to learn, especially if you plan on playing online. Since the original Quake engine had some bugs that made advanced moving techniques that are real useful in multiplayer possible, they decided to embrace those bugs and make them part of the physics of the game. Things like Bunnyhopping, circle jumping, and the infamous Rocket Jump are just a few examples of techniques that made Quake III very famous.\n\nOverall, I gotta say that Quake III Arena is to FPS games as Super Smash Bros. Melee is to fighting games. The really complex formulas and techniques that were present in the original Quake are improved and embraced in every way imaginable and the multiplayer community is still really strong. There was even a Dreamcast port of Quake III designed with Keyboard & Mouse controls in mind due to these special techniques that also has cross-platform capabilities with the PC version! Definitely get this game and enter the Arena!","December 21, 2015","true","18.6"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","14","14","2","9"

A pure deathmatch game at it's best. The controls are perfect, the vanilla graphics are still good today, and the gameplay... ♥♥♥♥ing awesome! One of my favorite features is the ability to play against bots with friends. Very fun if you just want to co-op in the game.\n\nI will say one thing. This game will test your skills and even help you improve your aim and reaction time as the combat is fast and fierce. After playing this game, I can say I am better at FPS games, especially ones with rocket launchers ;). This is one thing I cannot say you will get from most FPS games. This gives it another reason why this game kicks so much a$$! Not only are you having fun, but you are excersising your hand-to-eye coordination.\n\nEasy To Mod\nThis game is also very easy to mod. All you need to do is open the .pk3 files in a program like WinZip or WinRar and you can replace the game's sound effects, graphics, and models with custom ones you either downloaded or made yourself.\n\nTalking about mods, I highly recommend downloading ioQuake3 ( http://ioquake3.org ). It replaces Quake 3's rendering engine to suit modern machines giving you better net code and the ability to match your computer's native resolution. You can also download other mods for ioQuake3 to improve the game. Some other mods I recommend is the high res texture pack ( http://ioquake3.org/extras/replacement_content ) and the Metal-Tech v2.0 mod that replaces the textures for the weapons with higher res ones ( http://www.moddb.com/mods/metal-tech-v20-revolutions ).\n\nConclusion\nOn final note, this game is pure awesomeness and has a high replay value. If you are interested in playing a fast-paced FPS game to test out or improve upon your twitch skills, this is the game for you!","September 30, 2015","true","49.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

This is the only thing you need to know about this game. But regardless, here's some more info.\n\nThis game naturally inherited the smooth and fast-paced gameplay of its predecessor Quake (1996). As the original Quake was THE deathmatch classic in its time, Quake III Arena successfully rose to the throne and became the new king of its own time. Music is simple, yet it does the job very well. All the characters are very nicely voiced and the maps are, as expected from an id Software game, very very good. Oh and let's not forget the Railgun.\n\nThis game might be aging just like the original, but it is also timeless like the original.

Tight controls one expects from a PC fps are definetly put to use here, and if you wanted an example of PC over console, this is it. Story wise, this game is weeeaaak. It isnt told at all, and has unexplained cutscenes. You have to read the manual or look it up online to get what's going on, and I'm not going to tell you, as I feel it isnt to prominent in the game or this review. So that leaves the gameplay to decide how good of a game this is. the gameplay, is, amazing. As I said the controls are wonderful, and everything just works. Jumping to frag a guy and doing a 180 to frag another WHILE going dowhill onto another platform only to be propelled to a weapon of mass destruction is a great example of great gameplay, and fantastic level design. I would like to see how this game fairs on a console (Dreamcast version is all I know about unfortunately) but I cant imagine it being as good as the PC version. The soundtrack is a great metal and rock mix, full of the ambient sounds of screaming in some arenas gives off a darker mood, while the use of the metal can pump you up and ready you to blow up everyone in others. As far as characters go like I said the story is basically nill, but each has its own personality and little sayings in combat. Weapons in the game are designed well and all of them are fun to use, though it does seem a bit tedious stalking enemies with the machine gun you get right off the bat. Also, it is nice to see the BFG make an appearance.\n\nMy score: 8/10\n\nThough the story is weak, I rated Half-Life a 8 or 9 and that had mediocre gameplay, so its alright. Also the game is just down right fun to play, and I will come back to it time and time again.","August 5, 2014","true","4.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

At a normal 20 dollars, you're probably not thinking too much of it, but, if you're reaing this the same day I put this up, it's THE best time to pick it up, as well as the Team Areana, which is pretty much team-based gameplay; mostly the same as regular Quake 3 Arena.\n\nIt's the classic tournament-style shooter, consisting of free-for-all matches to conquer and rise up the tiers, only to face one badass dude at the top tier and defeat him. That's not very descriptive, and I've only played two matches with bots after finally getting this myself, but I DO intend on playing the hell out of this. This was my game back when I was like, 10 or so. I think my dad liked these kinds of games the most. He would play this for so many hours in a week, and he'd let me play, too. I was a total boss somehow. I forget what difficulty I played on, but probably just medium.\n\nAnyway, the goals are simple and you can't really get tired of this Quake game in particular.

Always focused on speed and Mutiplayer Gaming.\n\nQuake III - in my opinion shares the same space as Counter Strike, Golden Eye, and Unreal Tournament.  This was hands down one of these best mutiplayer combat games ever made.  Tight controls, fun weapons, fun maps, good graphics.  I was so amazed by this game and playing it at a Lan Party one weekend... I dreamed about it in my sleep.  I sometimes wish I could fall in love with another game like this.  If you have freinds and you guys want to try some old school mutiplayer games together... buy copies of this and play against each other... youll love it!!\n\nThat being said:  This game and some of the other Quake games really pushed the FPS genre into mainstreme and as a competetive sport.","December 20, 2011","true",""," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Playing single player has story mode, and it sure as hell hard when playing in highest difficulty i can promise you that, as i have beaten it myself but it wasnt easy.\n\nThis game has somewhat mixed with science and gothic (like how it is with Quake 1 and 2). The arenas are quite looking good, the weapons are really cool to use from. I like the movement on the character, so i would definitely recommend this. Be warned, if this is your first time playing then i suggest get some practice when playing this as its actually hard to use from as first time.

Unreal Tournament (1999) is a better game than this one (in my opinion anyways) but this is still a badass game. I did enjoy the AI in Q3A more than UT99 though since they're much more intelligent which is good since back when I used to play UT99 and Q3A a lot? I was on 56k dialup so I couldn't play MP with more than 4-6 guys or I'd lag out haha.\n\nQuake Live is a better choice these days than Quake III Arena... because it's free, has better support for modern hardware and has a more active community, but this is still a very good nostalgic twitch-fps game.","August 25, 2014","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Anyway I used to watch my brother play it and I always wanted to play, but being a brother and not wanting me to mess with his stuff he never let me play, all I could do is watch. One day I was browsing the steam store in the summer (there was a huge sale) and I saw this game!

I personally like the vogon servers which run the game about 5x faster, but I can't recommend that really- everyone I've ever shown it to thinks it's too fast to play. For *you*, maybe.\n\nDon't buy the steam version- cloud sync breaks it. Or something breaks it. Idk. I generally use the ioquake 3 engine. It's based on the quake 3 engine (which is open source) but it doesn't include the game textures (which are obviously not open source). If you buy this game off steam, I'd recommend just moving the textures to ioquake 3 and delete the steam install. Instructions for how to do this are on their site.\n\nIn fact, I recommend not buying any of the following from steam: doom 1-2, Quake 1-3. Steam ruins these games, all of them are open source, and you only need the texture files to play the game from the improved engines.","November 25, 2012","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although it appears that I have low play time on this game I actually played a hell of a lot of this game before I was on steam. This game is nuts, but you know..... fun nuts. The maps in this game are fun with not too many camping spots (as if you would feel the need to anyway) and are mostly quite large.\n\nNow....... The guns. Ok, so first up is the Machine Gun which is only good if you are accurate and your enemy is very inaccurate so lets skip this one. Then there is the Shotgun. One hit kill at short range of course and good damage at medium range. The Rocket Launcher is deadly to both your enemy and yourself but can also tend to take a few hits to kills if not hit directly. The Plasma Gun is basically a super Machine Gun. It has a lot more damage and similar fire rate. the Grenade Launcher in my opinion is the hardest gun to use because you have to time as well as place the grenade well. the Railgun, my favourite weapon, is basically a sniper that you have to no scope with (except unlike no scoper's in COD it actually takes skill) and is either a one or two hit kill. The Lightning Gun shoots out a stream of lightning towards your enemy and does decent damage. It's kind of like a Super Soaker except instead of water coming out there's lightning. And finally there is the BFG10K. now this gun is a one hit kill and has a fast automatic fire rate so it kicks ♥♥♥♥.\n\nNow in addition to these guns is the gauntlet, which is basically a glove with a spinning saw blade on it. Its usually a two or three hit kill but its always fun to kill someone with it. also there are several other items that can be placed on the maps such as +5, +25 and +50 health capsules, +5 armour shards, +50 and +100 armour vests, a mega health capsule, a quad damage power-up, as well as a regeneration power-up and a beast power-up. I won't take the time to explain these items (Most of which are pretty self explanatory anyway). The best piece of advice that I can give you is to aim well. You aim well and you win....\n\nAnyway I thoroughly reccomend this game to all and I hope this review helps.","March 19, 2015","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Consider this game if you enjoy classics and fast paced FPS gameplay. Even though I think Quake Live is a clone of this which makes it pointless to pay for this.\n\nQuake 3 Arena combines FPS gameplay with extreme speed of reflection and extreme-pace gameplay. As with old games, the game does not have much variation and no customization in comparison to today's games, but can still be a great fun.\n\nThe gameplay consists of players; humanoid shaped hitboxes that move at a very fast speed without penalties, with a weapon selection including a rocket launcher, a railgun (one-hit precision killer), a shotgun and a few machine guns. The game modes at least include DM, TDM and CTF, not sure about others.\n\nThe gameplay is just about maneuvering and shooting very quickly and precisely.

Still play this with the family during the holiday breaks as it is a basic game that all PCs/laptops can run and because LAN parties are FUN!
